Shild dispel dispel psychic scream SW:P mind flay to keep them in range, Mind blast, mind flay, After that it's a question of whether you're willing to try casting another mind flay or wand twice (you don't want to be counterspelled or shield bashed or kicked) before casting another mind blast. If that gets kicked, desperate prayer and hopefully your scream should be coming back soon enough. Keep youself topped up. They stopped your shadow spells, not holy.

Cognitive dissonance: " the state of having inconsistent thoughts, beliefs, or attitudes, especially as relating to behavioral decisions and attitude change. " 
---

---
You are the one that can't seem to accept an attitude change.  And have said the other guy suffers from it even as you argue over and over, like a broken record, that a mining node is different from a chest and ignoring all the arguments related to that.  I think you are the one that doesn't understand what the phrase means and think it is just a trump card you can throw at people to win a debate.
---
Try to break down the nuance of the distinction between lockpicking as a class utility (to which all rogues have access) versus professions that everyone chooses two of (including all rogues).  The inability to thread that needle is cognitive dissonance.  Further, blacksmiths and engineers are different from rogues opening a chest, because it is a profession and not a class utility, and additionally costs materials.  There, I explained it.   You can disagree that that differences doesn't change the nature of who gets the loot that's fine because it is a value judgement, which is subjective.  But they are objectively different.  So you can't just invalidate other's subjective judgement by denying the objective difference and calling them out for cognitive dissonance.
---
You can spare me the sarcasm about playing other classes, from your obsessive fixation with this issue and the rogue icon your biases are pretty clear.  For someone throwing around psychological terms like cognitive dissonance you should try reading up on bias.

Your point is valid, but there's nuance to be had. There's a difference between expecting everyone who drives a car to know how to rebuild a transmission, and expecting them to know how to toggle their headlights/wipers.

To elaborate, you tame a pet with the higher rank (presumably stabling your original pet) then make it attack things with the ability you want until it says you've learned it. You can then teach it to any pet that can use it.

Only thing I miss is the guild bank. I'd love a guild bank for classic, but I know that's a change and cannot be added in. It'd just be nice to have somewhere to dump all my excess mats, but I can always AH them I guess!

Has it been happening for 3 days?

My alliance is on that server. I randomly decided to roll horde elsewhere this morning. Glad I did.
---
I feel due to the fact that the majority of folk spend 70-80% of their time on one faction and roll/level on another faction only a little bit. I for one mostly focus on alliance, and I can assure you, 9/10 times I get killed it's due to getting ganked by higher levels for no apparent reason..... Although I was in the arathil highlands and I had a great experience of killing defias bastards next to an undead mage and not once was there any intention to screw our leveling up.
---
Even after by accident I tagged and shot him by furiously trying to get the last NPC on the map. I emoted sorry and backed up and we got each other.
---
Same as when I rolled through Ashenvale and started a campfire and fished next to another tauren hunter on the bankshore. Overall pleasant experiences except getting ganked by higher level bastards üòÇ

You have a 24% chance to miss while dual wielding. You need to hit things to build rage. The only dual wield tanks are fully geared farming AQ with a highly specific talent build and a hardcore raid guild. None of the hardcore guilds are using dual wield tanks, currently. They run deep prot with a shield.

Are you in Kalimdor? One of my friends can only connect to his characters that are located in Eastern Kingdoms, but not his Kalimdor toon.

More edge.
---
Seems like some layers have a working Kalimdor.  Log into an UD or EK alliance alt and find someome with a working Kalimdor layer.  They can invite you and switch your layer.   Then you can get back to Kalimdor.
---
Although he is extremely confident, he clearly missed the entire lore surrounding the Troll Wars/Trollbane and how the alliance between the humans and elves was working to make the entire race of trolls extinct prior to the Horde arriving, even killing them as they ran away.

But hey, at least the Alliance are the good guys.

Everyone on a pvp server is someone else's monster, as a horde keep killing us, nothing feels better then when 8 of us group up to down you and then have a dance party. You increased those players experience.

Do you have any actual experience with someone like this?  Sure, they'll eat up any kind of attention they can get, but the attention they're seeking, specifically, is anger and pleas.  They're after a position of power, not one of indifference and disregard.
---
8/8 was great mate.
---
Not only are they just dicks, think about the money they actually just cost some big companies. Their attacks on Twitch in particular are going to end up screwing them big time I think. Unlike WoW, they lose money every second people aren‚Äôt watching. What idiots.

I've tried several times and I've tried updating bnet and restarting but I'm not sure what else to do. Any ideas? What's going on?
---
If you don't stop and look around once in awhile
---
Can horde get this item?
---
Go to the spot and if you see other hunters camping him, I wouldn't try contesting if I were you. Instead i would try being nice to them to convince them to give you the timer when they get him. Stay on that layer (don't accept any invites from people). And exactly 8 hours after someone got him he will respawn. Just grind in the area nearby while you wait. IDK how load screens effect layering so I wouldn't risk it but it might be fine

To be fair, although he does this on purpose, the Restore Character button will ensure that his toon will always exist (however in 30 days from the moment this happened the name "Jokerd" will become available on that realm for anyone to take)

---
Okay, I expect this is gonna get buried, but they're not doing it for exposure.
---
It's a service. The service they offer is taking down a site. They're building a resume, allowing them to say "Look, our botnet can take down Wikipedia and Blizzard, so clearly we can take down your target".

Facts. Also you have to think some of these people probably had to come into work on their weekend, just so they could deal with what was going on.
---
Here's a workaround that I just tested on one of my characters stuck on Kalimdor:
---
Log on an alt in Eastern Kingdoms, get invited by someone in Kalimdor, wait for the layer to switch, log out of the alt and back on the main character in Kalimdor
---
Nobody ever RP's on RP servers in any game and if they do it's cringe as fuck.
---
A True RP PvP server would mean = you see enemy, you kill, no matter what.

It‚Äôs nothing wrong with reporting it ofc. It‚Äôs just.....pedantic???

Yeah whispering directly is the only only way to get an actual spell cleave group going. Just /who the class you want and lvl range then go down the list. Most wont but some will and it‚Äôs a numbers game.

Thanks never played classic wasn't sure.  I remember people saying that "on classic, the realm you play on actually mattered" so I figured they meant you couldn't transfer, thanks for clearing it up

Correct, ret. Was told ret is garbage end game. Is that not the case?

I'm a hunter so I am already screwed, add in all the leather and shit and even dropping it off at the bank or vendoring I still have issues if I want to stay out and finish quests without running back to the wuest givers.

Its not abnormal. I heard someone say it was 60/40, but I don't have a reliable source on that.

I do run into a fair bit of allies in contested zones though, so I'm digging it so far

It doesn‚Äôt matter what race/class you play. As long as you aren‚Äôt with a tryhard guild or pug you should be find to play whatever.
---
Pally heals are good too.

Aye. Cata was the beginning of the end.

Originally rolled Whitemane (shit 10k queues), better roll a lower pop server.

yooo

can it please just go up
---
"4 hours later..."
---
why the hell didn't you eat him??
---
Alternative solution: lock them into a cell until they level a warrior to 60 using only heroic strike
---
Holy Paladins are the go-to tank healers for Alliance.  This is the only "viable" spec for Paladins who want to raid.  However, I'm sure you can find a casual guild that would bring a Ret Paladin.  It's not like endgame content is actually that hard.
---
Yes however it‚Äôs dying and many long time players have been slowly moving away lately. A-net is focusing on getting new players instead of catering to the hardcore fan base.
---
For me the release of wow classic was what allowed me to see that gw2 wasn‚Äôt no longer fun.

Hes saying people use to do that. That's not true and was strictly a private server thing.
---
Yea I can get in on new toons.
---
I did know this. Don't ask how I know.
---
See, I want to be on a PvP server but I don't like what people believe they should be. I don't see the fun in killing someone who poses no challenge, and I really don't see the fun in corpse camping. Kill someone that you happen to run into while doing other business? Sure. Prowl around for the purpose of killing? Sure, as long as it's not the same person over and over. But waiting by their body and getting them before they can recover? That's not fun unless you literally get pleasure out of the unhappiness of others, and that's kind of fucked tbh. There's no challenge or sense of accomplishment. Only delighting in the frustration of others. Being that I'm not a sociopath, that's no fun to me.
---
It's like playing sports. You'd have to be messed up to feel accomplished defeating toddlers in a game of football. But at least in that case they're probably still having fun.

probably has more to do with the recent ddosing

Yes.
---
What are you even talking about, imagine believing he was inside a 10 player server Skype group.
---
Paladins are an OG hybrid. What they lack in pure DPS they make up in utility. You can play ret and do just fine.
---
As it's been said before, the hardest part about classic raids is getting 40 level 60s together that ran enough dungeons to get somewhat decent gear. Modern LFR is legitimately more difficult. There will be a group out there more than willing to recruit you ret or holy. Pally tank is admittedly a tough sell and not very viable though.

Well then shit man. I close discord overlay to fix mine. Check the blizzard forms. They have a hug report there and sometimes people post solutions

Well, calling them hackers is false. Hacking consists of gaining access to a system. This "group" has no access to the Blizzard servers. I would bet they just bought some BitCoin and rented a botnet array off the onion. Generally this is how it's done.
---
Honestly though, he somehow managed to regain his connection at the perfect time for a mount up. Either he pulled a really fuckin difficult procedure off, or it was just good luck from server being bombarded with ddos attacks

If you kill everything in WC then you will get 1 level per run. Starting at 18, finishing at 23/24.

What sucks is getting n00bs in your group that cause wipes which creates a 20-30 minute corpse run time sink.
---
or...
---
Having a group that only wants to skip mobs for shitty quests thus destroying all hopes of good xp during that run.
---
All dungeons are really fun if you kill every single mob and you dont have morons in your group that constantly wipe.
---
The guy I'm debating said "Terrorism is appropriate 100%"

Yeah that's just lag

---
Dang how much rest exp do you get?
---
You're clearly not seeing the dangers of using these kinds of charges so freely. 
---
Terrorism charges should be for TERRORISTS. You know, those guys who KILL people. NOT for animal activists breaking into slaughterhouses (ALREADY happened), NOT for protesters, and certainly not for something as minor as some sad basement dweller preventing you from playing your video game for a few hours. 
---
Send him to prison, get compensation for the company out of him, all good - don't fuck with terrorism charges.

Warlocks are insane.

Im wanted to level a mage but couldnt force myself to level another one in WoW so I went with lock.

Im slowly realising that locks are monsters in PvP. Like the developers thought "Lets make it a class that brings missery and suffering to PvP"

---
Easily 500g or more. Not only is it frost mage bis until BWL, but the proc chance on it is completely broken in PvP. It's not a "freeze" like you would expect, it's just a full-on 5 second stun. So you have a 1% chance to randomly drop a Hammer of Justice on any melee attackers.

This worked for me. If you are on Herod - Horde, login to a char on Eastern Kingdoms and whisper Patacake for a layer switch.  
---
Also thank you for posting.
---
Loot: Group Loot
---
Uncommon
---
skip items: No
---
This happened to me earlier when I used hearth. Kept dcing after that. Took a 45 minute break and it‚Äôs good now.
---
Not really though
---
I highly doubt that is their goal. Probably just pissed off neckbeards who earned a ban previously.
---
The rule is that PvP servers can't have a player with both factions on the server.
---
But there's no detriment to a PvE player paying for a transfer to a PvP server.
---
I encountered someone five-boxing warlocks in AV once.  They just ran around putting Curse of Agony on everyone.
---
Which caused more graveyard runs?
---
bullllllshit really?

My 7 year old I frequently demand a maternity test, as she's so very not me, but the 4 year old is clearly an example of his dad and I.

Imagine having to imagine the size of someone else's genitals in order to make a point about their character.

It's under the chat tab

This worked for me. If you are on Herod - Horde, login to a char on Eastern Kingdoms and whisper Patacake for a layer switch.
---
why not buy rend ranks?
---
Given that the weapon skill gives 3% hit and reduces the damage penalty of glancing blows, it's far more than 2% just from the hit alone.
---
How do you keep aggro? If I were you, i'd just keep casting growl whenever its possible.
---
Maybe
---
You can get data only unlimited lte for 35 a month to hotspot off. I do it when I'm traveling and typically use 200+ gbs per month
---
Some nerd was saying that was wrong because they didnt factor in the difference in Mob exp/Quest exp
---
TIL that Genn Greymane works at Google.
---
When 92 is half way to 99
---
I‚Äôm also new and tried WoW retail until lvl 15 and hated it so much, found the quests so boring and draining. My friend bought me another WoW retail subscription, and then I quit again at lvl 7.
---
I feel I will like classic coz there‚Äôs a lot of hype, is hunter good for PVE?
---
Np, dont remember if range mattered; if it doesnt work from a distance try standing next to it when clicking.
---
waited for him to pull a mob fucking pussy
---
Logged in- fell off flight path - cant relog now in kalimdor if that makes a difference
---
Lol nerd it's 92, not 93
---
PepeHands i've watched the pop go from low to medium and it just dc's me on login
---
Too soon?
---
People that do DDOS attacks think they are like the savior of the inter-webs when really you‚Äôre just a bum type savior no body wants.
---
Yeah man, the 50s are a fucking slog lemme tell ya
---
Go take a nap child
---
Seriously the guy above you is right. Just read. I wish I could downvote posts negative.
---
haha, just spat up my coffee. thanks.  
---
\*cleans off screen\*
---
Its still not bis for pvp unless you are extremely lucky, which good players shouldnt count on
---
When Sulfuras went down a few hours ago we had just pulled the last boss of a dungeon.  Thanks international douchebags.
---
I have questie, atlas loot, details and nug regen (rogue addon to visualize energy)
---
No love for the Rattlegang. Still can‚Äôt get in
---
Yes. Your comments still make you a baby.
---
I dont believe they offer it anymore unless in mistaken.. the only thing I saw was 100gb for like $120 a month
---
\#RattleGang
---
fuck pagle
---
I would literally reroll mage is I was you
---
I had this happen in rfc.  I could see green items looted but no roll option showed for me.  I didn‚Äôt see other people roles either but eventually the items were distributed to players.  I wonder if it showed me passing on the item.  Eventually it started working.  These were not unique items and the loot settings were not changed.  
---
I‚Äôd think submit a ticket in game.
---
Great comment.
---
What is ddos'ing?
---
And what is a twin?
---
2 days? What is this, amateur hour? 
---
 
---
Been two weeks for me soon :D
---
Nothing. The problem is being insecure about it.
---
Shows medium pop now tho
---
Shit like this ain't kids no more. You need a lot of fire power to take down large companies for an extended period of time these days.
---
I'm being overwhelmed with comments, so its a little hard to keep track of all this, but thank you all for the help!
---
kalimdor up on herod, just logged in in org
---
The script kiddy paying for this attack is probably from Rattlegore and tired of getting ganked in STV
---
Where's you shoot!
---
What position of power are they gaining? They had their little joyride with DDoSing and it's over now, they gained nothing but the probable arrest.
---
Hybrids do much better dps leveling than at 60.
---
Probably ff14 player getting revenge for the ff14 ddos attacks from the wow community
---
Honestly, I expected this shit. I'm just surprised it took a week. I would have thought they'd do it on launch.
---
Typical /b/tards probably.
---
Worked perfectly , thanks !
---
Disagree till 40 ~ 11 points in shadow is all you need. The rest is far better in disc or even holy.
---
While better solo, its not that much better. And you'll more than make up for it using melee cleave groups and being to actually be able to heal them.
---
Yo I logged out AND switched characters and everything is A-Okay... It's real, brothers
---
Do you think I‚Äôll still like classic questing if I hate WoW retail questing and found it so boring and felt like it was such a waste of time traveling for so long for quests?
---
It's not about fun it's about dps
---
Blizzard has said transfers will be coming. However I suspect it will be like vanilla where certain full servers will be able to transfer to certain pre-determined empty servers. 
---
Think how PvP battlegrounds are linked. 
---
Servers A B &amp; C will be able to xfer to any of D E &amp; F. 
---
Servers X Y Z will be able to move to any of W V U. Servers G - T aren't full, so they're ineligible to move.
---
300 minimum bro, congrats :)
---
Just say Fuck?
---
Not the asshole. Just the circle completing itself :)
---
Listen, we did not.
---
Thank you.
---
F
---
Man same fucking situation here. Really sucks
---
I also cannot log in
---
Even at lower levels, +shadow dmg is unbeatable. It makes drain life more dps than a wand until gravestone scepter and the latter do an obnoxious amount of dps after. I'm skipping the class robes and going straight for shadowweave and gearing for now with a +sp &gt; sta = spirit &gt; int priority. Spirit is very, very useful because you spend so much time outside the 5 second rule. You don't need more int than it takes to spam dots on a group of mobs or draining life for a while.
---
My friend and I did some more investigation about Mograine being down, it turns out it is just Kalimdor down but Eastern Kingdoms is fine.
---
Yes exactly this. Now someone mentioned unique items, which I wasn't aware they gave this behavior. But I had this in lower level grouping, so I don't think those were unique items, but don't know.
---
My friend, you underestimate the thrill of 1 shotting character's 10 levels below you, that is the real end game brother.
---
Rattlegore still isn't working for me.
---
"wow community"
---
I scored serious fucking dad points today so I can sleep late tomorrow if i wanted to. And this happens. lmao.
---
I have had nothing but good times all around. I have been doing dungeons since level 15, I barely have time to quest... But all my groups have been amazing, patient and without drama.
---
To be honest sm mage cleavest were mostly friendly even if half of the conversation is how fast we are going and patting each other on the back.
---
Hi, /u/Maybe_Black_Mesa
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d14an2/its_2019_and_ddos_attacks_are_sill_a_thing_why/). 
---
Unironically, yes. You'll fit in better if you 'dumb yourself down' to the majority's 'inferior' level, super genius.
---
Basically what the others have said, still except in extreme circumstances there‚Äôs not really a reason to NOT do it. It‚Äôs still free money while you level.
---
I‚Äôm jealous. What did that set you back?
---
Me am that kind of orc
---
‚ÄúArcane shit‚Äù
---
Well hunters are more aggressive in classic than I remember...
---
4 itchy tasty
---
Same
---
Look for weapon vendors or gunsmiths
---
1.Recklessness makes the monster hit harder, so they'll take more damage from it. 
---
2.The feared mob is almost always going to run into AT LEAST 1 other mob now they're fighting multiple things AND taking more damage from them.
---
This is why you dont rush in and steal tags and force other people to do your killing for you.
---
LOL this guy Rattlegores
---
Who is the "they" you're referring to?
---
Antonio Brown as the hacker confirmed.  Per Adam Scheffter he recently /gquit his guild there and rerolled with Belichick on Smolderweb.
---
Dude read the damn post. Every server works BUT Rattlegore. I highly highly doubt the DDOSER would shutdown ONLY Rattlegore. Why dont you try logging onto the server with a character so I can get some confirmation that I'm not the only one with this issue and I can delete this post.
---
Does this qualify as something I should be contacting the FBI about?
---
IT IS A SATURDAY NIGHT RRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Ah yes must be your first because someone who has been around for a while would know that this ain't going to last. They do it for a while because it's popular then stop bothering after the hype has gone down. Many games including blizzard have done this and will continue to do so
---
Seriously it's 2019. If you're ddosing you're just asking for legal trouble. Nobody is impressed either. This guy's name will be the smallest of blips.
---
No it makes you run out of quests quicker.
---
skateboarders and mages HATE pebbles
---
The older the weapon the longer you have to kill a mob.
---
The class is quite reliant on new weapons.
---
&gt; Edit: Please don't message me asking for the information I have. I will not start a witch hunt. 
---
No need to worry, we would never go for that.  Witch hunts are executing witches or hounding people for their views.  What we want is manhunt.  You got a loc on these fuckers?
---
I might suggest a hybrid. Tactical mastery/defensive. Charge &gt; thunderclap &gt; defensive &gt; Shield block/taunt/revenge &gt; berserk &gt; WW &gt; battle &gt; thunderclap
---
I honestly don't think 2h vs 1h is make or break in terms of threat, and for overall group damage it's almost meaningless... but if the group wants to aoe the instance and you aren't speced to accommodate, it makes sense that they'd complain.
---
Shitty that they didn't make the game harder to make up for the overpowered 1.12 talents like the private servers did, so an easier version of old content is what we have to deal with. Proper tanking might be a thing of the past.
---
Maybe? Questing in retail is 10x longer, I‚Äôve played like 8 hours a day for 3 days mainly grinding and questing when worth it, and am only lvl 26.
---
It will take much longer but it feels more of a difference between each time you lvl and get new gear and etc, it may take longer but when you do you feel more accomplished
---
Dude I really don‚Äôt understand it either. They‚Äôre literally watching someone play a game and Literally no one is even reading their messages because there‚Äôs like 100 messages being sent every second. The sad part is most of these ppl aren‚Äôt even teenagers they‚Äôre actual like 20+ adults.
---
I think the voice acting and writing for VC is sooo good.  Definitely one of my favorites. When he tells players to stay down it hurts.  Calling us all lap dogs?  Yup awesome.
---
RATTLE OR WE RIOT!!!
---
My kid is gone all weekend! I was gonna get lvl 30 :(
---
You can teach how to play better but you can't teach friendliness
---
Just posted a video of it in action in my description comment. Check it out. It‚Äôs really pretty easy to play.
---
It‚Äôs the primary reason I have a bind for blood rage demo shout. Have to be fast!
---
I finally hit 30 last night and now I can't even enjoy it
---
Likely a side effect of the DDoS attacks
---
Enough with this wow imagine shit already.
---
There is no 1 single guide that just 'teaches you the game' if that's what you're looking for.  You can try looking at youtube for beginner tips and tricks sort of thing, but outside of that I would do as I mentioned in my previous comment and try looking for specific guides based on the aspect of the game you want to learn.  Try searching wowhead.com for a class guide and profession guide, for example.  Outside of that, the game game is mostly guided in that they give you quests, you do them around that general area, and you get xp for turning them in.  Once you're done with an area they will generally send you to the next level appropriate area.
---
Leveling is all about fun, nobody gives a shit about your dps below 60 and neither should you
---
Yeah I know.... if you read my post you would have noticed I mentioned every server BUT Rattlegore works. That's why I made this post....
---
this is why troll is the master shadow priest race.   beserking ftw
---
Not wetlands
---
Everyone is a little different on this philosophically. For me, I don‚Äôt log in day after day to play a DPS or optimize a strategy or level fast or top charts. I wanna play every day because I wanna harness fel energy and summon demons as my warlock, or show compassion and heal as my priest. I‚Äôm not trying to be the best player, I‚Äôm trying to embody a character.
---
I don‚Äôt even RP in chat and whatnot, but I do play the game to watch the story of this world.
---
If you wanna be fuckin awesome at all the meta stuff that‚Äôs great too you can be friggin awesome. Look for more subreddits and discord servers and whatnot, nerds have been nerding about this online for years so there is a plethora of shtuff. I personally can‚Äôt comment a ton on that.
---
But my two cents is play the game and enjoy it. There are choices every step of the way, really choosing is the game. Like I said, tons of resources, but after consulting them only you can make a decision you can live with.
---
Those fucking kobolds are getting it when I get back in there...
---
dude same. this is killing me
---
With a bit of Dr. Doom
---
But it's extremely pay2win

I think you can buy one from this npc:

I binged the hell out of that show. Can't wait for the new season.
---
i'm on eu and have had no issues at all throughout the day
---
Same for me.
---
lucky
---
Huh not sure then
---
Nope.
---
But I thought Tony stopped the boats?
---
lol i thought the exact same thing
---
sameee, trying to get my 30 warrior quest done
---
Low effort? Fuck you. I'm asking a valid question that applies to this sub.
---
A steep price.
---
Didn't Forbes list him as #1 earlier this year?
---
Is anyone able to get on Rattlegore yet?
---
That might be the link above, but one guy said he made a new character, login, then was able to switch
---
Nah this is false. You downrank spells once you have a lot of gear that increases the healing done by your spells, making them more mana efficient.
---
Without gear that gives you +healing, your highest rank Lesser heal/Heal/Greater heal gives the most healing per mana spent, and allows you breaks in between casts to regenerate mana.
---
In late game raiding, yes, downrank spells. Not before then.
---
Power surge can happen literally anywhere. Water pouring out of socket is either abnormal weather or really shitty construction of the building your in, or again an effect from the construction next door. Neither of these things has anything to do with our industry.

I‚Äôm in this guild....ima find out who you are and read your history.

Alright, lets continue with your Olive Garden analogy. Lets say that on a fine Saturday night, you don your finest fedora, trim up that neck beard nice and neat for your future "muh'lady" and you head up to that American institution, the Olive Garden. The advertisement draws you in... Free Salad and Breadsticks with purchase of a meal. So, you head in, intrigued by the thought of being in public. You sit down and order your meal. You're there for the salad and the breadsticks so what the fuck does it matter what it is. "I'll have steak!" Because you're not worried about the price of the meal since you're getting what you want for free. The salad and breadsticks arrive. The nostalgia of your you rushes back to you... nights in the basement... eating breadsticks and salad all night... the golden days of no responsibilities. You don't touch the steak. You don't even want the steak. You liked steak at one point... then you didn't. You never touched it again. But now you can order steak and get what you really want for free... still... the steak goes uneaten. The bill arrives. $34 for your steak, with free salad and breadsticks. You pay it, giddy that you just  got your meal for free. You're 100% right. Your sub is for retail wow and classic is the free addition. Much like paying for the steak and getting your beloved breadsticks free. But guess what... if you don't eat the steak and all you ate was the salad and breadsticks... you paid for breadsticks.  If you don't play retail wow then classic isn't free.
---
Really!? I remember it being established that blizzard put in night elf females for all the virgins to wack over.
---
still not working for me either ;\_\_;
---
Spirit IS good for rogues.
---
It significantly lowers downtime between mobs while questing solo because their natural regen is extremely low.
---
Most rogue guides will have Agility and spirit as equally important as the top stat for rogues.
---
KUI?
---
Fuckers...
---
I'm guessing this is why I was most likely getting a ton of lag at about 1500 UK time then?
---
You committed the ultimate cardinal sin, you fucked up You, as a team of professionals trying to maintain a server fucked it all up. You fucked up and decided fix it hours later, not giving us "Sub-time" and "WoW Tokens". Not a wise move.
---
We won't forget this. You've set a new tone for the kind of interaction we'll be having with you. It's a cold one. One where there aren't any illusions about the reality of the situation. Previous notions of "family" are dead. We are mere consumers to you, and that is obvious.
---
You have chosen to bring in a new era of hostility and bitterness. Well done. Great Big Dick move.
---
Its a gadam conspiracy
---
Jesus everyone in this thread is retarded. I know the servers have been ddosed ALL DAY LONG. They are all back online and the ONLY ONE that isnt working is Rattlegore.
---
Apparently hunters are prejudice also "Wong Clip"
---
I have noticed something happening with regards to mailing alts items or gold today, the items or gold are not showing up in the mail for the alt.
---
Doesn't matter. That wasn't the point the guy was making.
---
I get the same thing!
---
While you're still level 4, how much do you care about your race and minmaxing?  Cuz there are better options if you care more about min maxing but it's not a big deal if you'd rather be an elf.
---
But what if the servers are up and ready to play before 30 minutes or 1 hour, then I would have missed all that time.
---
Alright, here's what I got. I took down the original down 38 characters and made an improvement that takes it down another 4 characters.
---
```
---
=== Original (255): 
---
/run local r,p=GetPlayerFacing(),math.pi local x,y=(r&lt;3/8*p or r&gt;13/8*p) and "north" or (r&lt;11/8*p and r&gt;5/8*p) and "south" or "",(r&lt;7/4*p and r&gt;5/4*p) and "east" or (r&lt;3/4*p and r&gt;1/4*p) and "west" or "" SendChatMessage("‚Äôs compass points "..x..y,"emote")
---
=== Original (golfed, 224):
---
/run local r,p,x,y=GetPlayerFacing(),math.pi/8 x,y=(r&lt;3*p or r&gt;13*p)and"north"or(r&lt;11*p and r&gt;5*p)and"south"or"",(r&lt;14*p and r&gt;10*p)and"east"or(r&lt;6*p and r&gt;2*p)and"west"or""SendChatMessage("‚Äôs compass points "..x..y,"emote")
---
=== Using bitshift (217):
---
/run local r,p,f,t,v=GetPlayerFacing(),math.pi,math.floor,{1,1,5,4,4,6,2,2,2,2,10,8,8,9,1,1}v=t[f(r/p*8)+1]SendChatMessage("‚Äôs compass points "..(({"north","south"})[v%4]or"")..(({"west","east"})[f(v/4)]or""),"emote")
---
=== Using bitshift and correcting algorithm (previously it had 25% north/south, 12.5% east/west, 25% divided up among the other directions) (213).
---
/run local r,p,f,t,v=GetPlayerFacing(),math.pi,math.floor,{1,5,4,6,2,10,8,9}v=t[f((r+p/8)%(p*2)/p*4)+1]SendChatMessage("‚Äôs compass points "..(({"north","south"})[v%4]or"")..(({"west","east"})[f(v/4)]or""),"emote")
---
Yes thousands of people.  Are you on Rattlegore
---
I hate that fucking word.
---
So real talk, as someone who knows nothing about this stuff: If legitimate requests are so easy to distinguish from genuine requests, why can't this kind of thing be automatically stopped?
---
Can someone ELI5 this situation to me? Why are people talking about jail
---
ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä $15  a month ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
---
Yeah and there are very much classes who need some of the items a lot more. When I'm a healer and you roll on a +3 stam +3 agi +12 Spirit item, then it is my item not yours. And this becomes even more prevalent when you roll on a two hand BIS weapon while a warrior/enhance shaman is present.
---
No
---
#RATTLEGORE LIVES MATTER
---
*rattle rattle rattle*
---
dat a bloodrazor?
---
Griefing hurts peoples feelings. That‚Äôs a fact.
---
That makes it real-world physical violence. Blizzard should do more to stop it.
---
Read my fucking comment!!! You have no idea how ddos works... it can affect any or all servers. Sorry yours is being affected the most. Jesus fucking christ God read a book and calm down. You freaking out over everyone who says dos on here make syou obviously not know what ddosing actually fucking is.
---
It's taken you 3 comments to mention this.
---
Yea for fucks sake, pick up a phone and run an IRS scam or something
---
Luckily, it‚Äôs on sale for $20 off
---
Typical 8 year old bad at math
---
So obviously it‚Äôs not fixed 100% yet
---
Because again. You clearly don‚Äôt understand how this works.
---
Unless your alliance
---
Only ranged.
---
 Man, people who spam this REE shit look like the stupidest players I‚Äôve ever seen.
---
End of my irrelevant rant lol.
---
Hes a a GD idot nothing more.
---
Minmaxing? Wdym?
---
Odd groups DoS left, even groups DoS right
---
Heartbreaking?  Bit of an over exaggeration.
---
Can anyone else login to Rattlegore server?
---
Damn dude. What continent is your broken character on?
---
So you complete the quests quicker... I'm not seeing the problem
---
Legit never had anyone ask me any questions in a dungeon unless we just wiped or something. Usually it's "Hey Shaultz, what happened?" and I explain that we either pulled too much, or I lost aggro on a mob because of whatever reason, or the hunter sent his pet to attack the wrong mob because he keeps tab targeting and not paying attention even though we've been leveling together since he was level 7 and I keep fucking telling him to click his targets and pay attention, or use his assist macro so that he knows what he's targeting, but nooooooo he keeps pulling the next group of mobs and going "Oh shit..." in discord, just early enough for me to realize what happened, but late enough that I'm powerless to stop it.
---
At least everyone can agree people with small dicks are a menace to society
---
Basically it goes:
---
1. Agility
---
2. Spirit
---
3. Strength
---
4. Stamina
---
Avoid int, it might as well do nothing for you.
---
If a warrior passes on strength gear, I would need on it as well if it was an upgrade to an existing piece.
---
No I want someone to fucking tell me if they can or cant login to Rattlegore. Why the fuck is this so hard for you retards to comprehend.
---
This is one of the most relatable comments I have ever seen posted regarding this topic. My conclusion is that the hardcore fans of streamers are really young because I can‚Äôt imagine anyone else being so interested.
---
So, what? You want your $0.30 rebate?
---
Getting every little advantage you can get.
---
preach
---
unless his alliance what?
---
Waiting on Rattlegore like the "Let me in" meme
---
NTA. Look I‚Äôm horde, but this is life being on a pvp server. You‚Äôre just playing the game.
---
Reeeeeeee cringe normies
---
We wiped twice. Third time we just kited his ass through the dungeon while myself and a shaman just healed everyone. Took longer but it worked. His shadow bolts and MC are too intense for that level.
---
Alright I see, thanks.
---
You clearly have no idea what you're talking about. Waste of time I guess.
---
No, hence the post.  
---
King's honor, brother.
---
I had to spend time with my gf today, the very nerve of these virtual terrorists!!!
---
there could be many different reasons. networking isnt just that simple. the DDOS at this moment could specifically be disrupting connections with your ISP and its connect to blizz servers. but whoever is responsible probably isnt DDOS phone company networks responsible for connecting to blizz servers.
---
Winner.
---
You're using filthy casual slur, but at the same time dissing people who play all day, which is it? You're invoking the holy "muh family!" bullshit which means literally nothing because streamers have families too. Do you think literally every streamer is a childless, single, lone child orphan? If you seriously haven't gotten out of work for once on time on the weekend, you're letting a shitty employer take advantage of you and you should already have one foot out the door, or accept your lot as your employers favorite doormat-employee.
---
Technically no, because your attacking with your "paws" and not the weapon. Although trinkets that say "Equip: Chance on hit..." do proc as far as I'm aware.
---
This man is a hero.
---
Yo this isn‚Äôt exactly relevant but I am SO fucking pissed at windows rn. I upgraded a bunch of hardware (mobo, cpu, etc) which deactivated my copy of Windows because it thinks it‚Äôs on a different PC now. Annoying, but whatever easy enough to play along with, just gotta find that old key. Well after a month of searching I finally do and go to reactivate when I see that because I originally activated it before upgrading to 10 I wouldn‚Äôt be able to activate and had to buy a new copy. 
---
I only had 10 because windows literally FORCED me to upgrade, along with everyone else who still had 7 at year end 2017 (or whichever year, I honestly don‚Äôt remember). These motherfuckers have pigeonholed me into rebuying a copy of Windows to replace a perfectly good one for no reason.
---
rattlegang
---
I play druid on a PvP server.  I will faerie fire every non-stealthed rogue even during 'peace questing' just in case.
---
LMFAO accurate
---
Every fucking thread
---
Mine too! Sucks so bad
---
Don't forget about the 5 second rule, cast in burst! As stat priority spirit first, int second but you will want both.
---
I waited all goddamn day to play because I thought I'd let the DDoS I heard about get taken care of. I only play on Rattlegore.  Whyyyyyyyy
---
I mean I just picked one example. There are thousands.
---
The problem with fire is that its useless for the first tier of raiding due to mobs having fire resistance/immunity. Leveling fire is fine but then you need to pay to respec later
---
A year of your life, a permanent stain on any future job applications, and a moderate student loans worth of debt is still a steep debt to pay to moderately inconvenience a few people.
---
Posture check

You weren't able to do pve to pvp, but you could do pvp to pve.
---
I guess its to avoid leveling with no danger then switch to pvp realm at 60.
---
It's true. Your dad is getting paid a little extra every month, the sum of which totals three months of pay.
---
Are you simple?
---
It‚Äôs a video game, a service. It isn‚Äôt public infrastructure. If they were cutting the fiber optics cables that connect your area to the net or something then it would be.

So what fellow rattlegorers are here? I'm Shadowbolt

Mind telling me what this means? I‚Äôve never heard of it

Yeah. you're right. 8 years is a bit much. But they deserve to be punished fairly harshly, if nothing else than to set a precedent.

---
I dont enjoy getting combo stunned its just not fun, im incredibly competitive in every other game i play but wow pvp just isnt fun
---
Did you play for awhile on the other server? Cause I could play but it would disconnect after 5-10 mins.
---
Except that he literally confirmed the source and gave them attention...
---
Let me know if you get in.
---
Aside from having a cape? I don't see the resemblance.
---
No, they just buy zero days on the dark web like everybody else.
---
damn, not even on reddit am i safe.
---
and how many other people have posted saying they CANT get into rattlegore or are having problems with that specific server? quite a bit dipshit. first you wanted a REASON as to why it was specifically rattlegore and NOW you just want clarification. YES rattlegore specifically is having issues in response to the attack. now fuck off and do something productive with your free time spazz
---
Woah woah woah, this is not my Batman cup.
---
Which server is this?
---
r/cringe
---
I'm a level 40 rogue on a pve server right now.. this really makes me wish I had rolled on a pvp server instead. I've had a handful of battles in STV and connecting areas but not nearly as many as I could have. 
---
This looks fun
---
God I'm done with you retards telling me I dont know what DDOS is. No one in this fucking thread will try to log into Rattlegore and tell me they cant. Keep commenting I'm not responding anymore lol.
---
Fitness isn't a hobby, it's a lifestyle!
---
Ah yes, the man with knowledge. 
---
How about you actually say something with evidence, and then feel free to go fuck yourself.
---
Yeah I mean, jobs are just slavery to the man, right?
---
"eat shit scrub" pft, was this dude born in the 80's? Geez.
---
Happy cake day. 
---
However rattlegore wasn't their main focus. It was all US PvP realms. The issue is most likely not, at this moment, from the DDoS. Most likely an issue on the back end with Blizz
---
Rogue: God dammet! I was gonna be peaceful on this server but fuck It!
---
"We are dealing with someone who has no life." *gasp*
---
Waaaa. Woo is us.
---
Yeah every other server works but Rattlegore. It's so frustrating üò©
---
Ya so why did you bring it up in something completely irrelevant
---
you can't track buffs on the target frame in vanilla, only debuffs and if you're targeting people to heal them then that's just lame, use a mouseover macro with your raid frames
---
As a druid, whenever I see an enemy rogue I always faerie fire them then run away. I dont want to bother with actually getting into a full fight, but I find it amusing to throw a mild inconvenience their way for 45 sec
---
It isn't like most of us aren't use to this happening at the release of games. At least Blizzard got attacked by some donkey instead of it being their own fuck up.
---
What are the chances this isn't coming from a foreign country with no extradition though?

Script kiddie means lack of skill. DDOSing tools are widely available so any script kiddie can do it. It's an insult to the person doing it not saying it isn't a hurtful action.

Video game with access to thousands of private citizens' personal information should I remind you of the playstation hacks?

I think my definition of terrorism relates to the quantity of people that are affected or inconvenienced and I'd bet it's significantly over 100k today. It also relates to people's feeling of security, or ability to enjoy things in the future that they feel may not be available again. Regardless, blizzard should be ashamed and embarrassed that they were vulnerable.

Meee. I am Kiji the priest or Lucrette the warlock (both horde).

Couple? I only give them one and that's being generous.

I saw the same thing on my server today. Was doing a quest in Ashenvale and there was about 10 horde in the area around me. It was extremely stressful, but they ultimately left me alone. Lol. I was very thankful.
---
Good time to mention the Rattlegore subreddit:  http://reddit.com/r/Rattlegore/
---
Get posting rattle gang!
---
Taking 3.5 hours for it is pretty fckn long though. I believe when I did it we took about 2 hours. And that included 3 people from the group leaving and me essentially making a new group mid dungeon.

The superior butcher cleaved off his own shirt to free himself of resistance while he butchers.  That dedication is why he was promoted.

I‚Äôve been trying to log in all day, I would get in for about 5 or 10 minutes then I‚Äôd get dc‚Äôd again. Still trying for the last hour, no luck past the loading screen.

Yes it is. Just create an undead on other servers like oceanic, get someone to invite you, log off and get back in on your main

It‚Äôs pretty quiet out here, but easy farming and I‚Äôm making bank on the AH lol
---
Ok who on rattlegore ganked/ninjad gear from this kid.

OK nvm LOOOOOL

Just found out the problem. Apparently someone said Kalimdor is down, so I tried to make an undead on mograine and log in and that worked lmao... idk how this makes sense tho.

Every paladin playable race is top tier for Vanilla.

What a slag

Where can you get giftwrap?

Why do people care? Honestly. Why do people care? So what? Let people play the game how they like. As long as they aren't violating ToS let them play how they want to play.

---
Yeah this post isnt going to get much attention.
---
Yes, this! I'm so glad this was finally understood by people and Blizzard too apparently. Classic really is a much better game and the community is an integral part of this. Cross realm dungeon finder killed all sense of community. No longer were you a star healer or tank on your realm, in fact no cared at all anymore when dungeons were so routine and not special anymore and no one friended each other over cool experiences. Mage is my favorite, but I'm still considering druid over mage in classic because, besides being under represented, they can fill literally any role until level 60 so when they really should go full resto. But a feral druid is still a great OT and a threat in BGs. 
---
Play Alliance on classic and check out how much fun people are gonna have questing Hogger and Deadmines. You just don't see that anymore in the main game. It's like I'm back in 2006 again.
---
Every single realm sans a couple ones are horde favored.  
---
  The only way to fix this would be blizz giving incentives for players to roll the other faction.  
---
  That being said, it's way too early to start saying its imbalanced. 
---
  The realm transfers, queues, big wave at the start, level differences, overall hype, etc make everything seem different than what it could be a couple months from now.
---
Of course we have a subreddit
---
Conversely, once you know the layout WC is really fun. I'd recommend doing it at least 5 times.
---
I got this error when I was changing video settings, but other than crashing my game for a moment, nothing else happened.  Try the repair tool in the launcher.
---
i will try thanks !
---
I‚Äôve tried Herod and Whitemane and they seem to be working. I main rattlegore and am still unable to get in
---
If they let people transfer to other sizes of servers, it just creates the same queue on another server.
---
There is a script that you have to run that re enables them back to default. I am sorry I don't have it on me right now but I had the same exact problem a couple of days ago and I googled and found a blizzard forum article where somebody gave the script and I copied and pasted it
---
Like, every horde. And also alliance. Even without honor, the ganking is real #STV
---
Lulz I guess?
---
yeah this is OC, it was a bitch to make so i'm glad you liked it lol.
---
Granted, this was about 8 years back, but I've seen Blizzard's rackspace in an AT&amp;T datacenter on the eastern seaboard. They have a large cage, within an even larger co-location facility where they stage their own hardware, connected to the AT&amp;T backbone network. Credit where it's due, they ran a tidy setup, and definitely ordered pallets of RedBull for their weekend maintenance staff. Also worth mentioning, this was just one of their physical locations.
---
Dont ask for a tip for portals just charge. As for food/water, I give away 1 stack. If they ask for more, then I'll charge (unless we are in a dungeon)
---
It's the classic experience

Then sit in shitty queues.

The entire point is to move people from high pop to low pop, not create another login jam.

Out of a hundred.

You'll be the best shaman tank, generating threat like no other with that regen!

I don't care that they broke their elbow
---
&gt; horse flight path
---
a what now
---
No problem. Its always nice to help other players!
---
That's the whole purpose of realm transfers though, they don't want people to jiggle between "cool" servers but offer some people that cannot cope with queue times on "cool" servers to choose a quiet one and help said server to establish a bigger community at the same time
---
I can't believe there's a rattlegore sub. Didn't realize we had such a community.
---
It‚Äôs weird how you can put your job on some pedestal, yet not give a shit about theirs.  
---
I don‚Äôt even understand why streamers even got brought up in the first place.
---
Are there really more people playing retail?
---
Rested EXP gains a lot slower than it did on private servers. Even being logged off for ~9 hours overnight, I only get like 4-5% rested experience at an inn.
---
Why Rattlegore? Is there some popular streamer on that server being targeted?
---
I mean it‚Äôs not easy to get shit done when you work 55 hours a week, go to grad school classes 12.5 hours a week and have a gf who you have to spend 8+ hours with a week. I have like 6 hours of free time left every week so sometimes I play classic wow when I have free time instead of doing shit like laundry and grocery shopping.
---
But hey on the bright side all the disconnecting and subsequent corpse running rage made me wanna quit wow again again. So yeah, fuck it. Now I can use those 6 hours to actually do responsible adult things.
---
Well I'm grinding rep for the quest too, so I'm focusing on them right now.
---
Yup.

What ever you want but one of you should be something that can heal

It's not about NEEDING it though, it's about efficiency.

[Updated Graph](https://imgur.com/a/JpspjSu) after purging the database and rescanning twice after the ddos passed. The big drop you see on the higher end of the graph is at level 40-&gt;41 where there is a dip of over 30 players. Peak is still at 30 with 222.

Sorry, I'm not having it, just you watch when I hit 60 man, I'm gonna be lethal

Exactly. I think he's missing the point.

I can only wonder. I havent hear the word "queer" used as an insult in ages.

This is what my wife an I do. Works fine

Does anyone else feel like this is code for, "Well we're going home for the day"

I pissed someone off yesterday by "stealing" a random quilboar they were apparently about to kill, so it was probably me.

Hunters get aspect of the cheetah early on I believe. (Granted my knowledge of this is from tbc/wrath).

The bosses with the gems stay there btw. I walked a rogue back to the boss he forgot to loot after the dungeon.

It caps at 1 1/2 levels.

Hoping for an update on this soon!

Torch reward from the lighthouse in Westfall is also very cool

I was a Druid in a raiding guild back in vanilla. I loved healing and figured this time I‚Äôd go priest (after spending some time leveling a Druid). It‚Äôs amazing how much of an easier time I‚Äôm having with the priest. Just need to get more used to the healing and play style compared to Druid.

Thanks for the feedback.

I had a blast tonight on Harod. Huge war over that yeti cave in Hillsbrad I think. Horse pushed us back, then we pushed them back. Back and forth. 
---
For the Alliance!
---
As much as I hate to admit it, I think you're right.
---
Sure, it's great for that. Roll whatever class appeals to you, but it would be beneficial for at least one of you to be able to heal (druid, paladin, shaman, priest), and if you plan on doing dungeons it would also be good if one of you can tank (warrior, druid)
---
Huntard checks out
---
I choosed a Paladin, im saving for 60lvl mount.
---
Axe/sword skill is a lot better than mace,  not only endgame but also while leveling. The reason everyone gets the axe is not due to the spec, but due to the axe having the slowest attack speed, which makes you hit harder with all of your attacks based on weapon damage (mortal strike etc). 
---
In other words, if you are an arms warrior you are intentionally gimping yourself by not picking the axe.
---
is this a meta-post? pretty sure the rogue posted last night.
---
What realm?

Nice, server is filling up. Its only been two days and looking promising to have that nice prime 3-5k player base
---
Obviously not him though
---
This post just means they won
---
I'm on Faerlina and AoE is the best for leveling. You can kill 4 mobs at once for a quest. Improved Blizzard is a necessity for the slow.
---
Nope. Proper procedure is to /roll before looting and winner gets the chest. Obviously this takes some time for people to realize, but if someone were to "first come first served" this chest, there would be more than one salty group member.

1. Druids - Cat form is 30% at 21 and Travel is 40% at lvl 30. Both instant and dispell root/slows.
---
2. Shaman - Ghost wolf is 40% at lvl 20. 3 sec cast.
---
3. Hunter. Cheetah aspect is 20% at lvl 20.
---
4. Mages and rogues. 
---
5. Everyone else.

I rolled a lock.

I worked two days straight away from home got home... woke up and this. I hope this man gets shanked by his celly

Make sure your name starts and ends with "xx"

Should work then

"Finally hit 60" as if it's anything short of insanity to already be 60 at this point

Didn‚Äôt think so thanks

I roll on gear I don't need and ninja chests.

Dam, I so under estimate that spell back in 2004. Now its the first thing i put talent in, running around at 36% mov speed is so dam good.

I haven't seen a whole lot of RP in that sense, the most i've seen is excessive emoting which is totally fine. Am i going to be limited to what I say to be in character?

---
Hey guys at least people are noticing Rattlegore now!
---
Vanilla is special to me because its slowed down. Shit is actually meaningful, you actually need to read the quests to complete them (unless u cheat with addons) and the lack of mounts and dungeon / raid finder means you actually have to explore the world. If I could have all that + transmogging I wouldn't even think about playing normal WoW.
---
Barrens chat was similar to this in Vanilla, people seemed to have taken that memory and made it much more obnoxious for tradition‚Äôs sake this time around.
---
It‚Äôs not as bad in other zones, and for the most part the other zones are nothing like Barrens chat at all really. The people spamming chat with nonsense are mainly doing it since they are in Barrens. 
---
I just try to ignore my chat box until I‚Äôm through the zone
---
is that not still a thing now?

I cannot get this to work. Anyone Horde on Skeram lend a hand?

You are still going to have to farm cloth and/or morrowgrain.  Quests will never get you there alone, even as a human.

Targeting WoW Classic on the weekend. I'd be first in line to kick them in the genitals. They have basically robbed me of my already limited time to play. WTF is wrong with these  people.. Always trying to fuck with anything they can. Would sure be nice to ship people who intentionally cause problems to where ever trash island is and leave them there.

Just passed 100g at level 37. All I did was use found cloth and bought cloth and sold bags.
---
This is body shaming.
---
you tilted?
---
It seems like Shamans get 40% at 20, while Druids get it at 30.
---
So Shamans are the fastest for 10 levels, then its a tie.
---
Holy shit, you crushed it...... And if I'm reading that correctly, you even made it more accurate. Thank you very much. What do you do at your day job?

Rattlegore
---
Generally speaking the highest W.Damage based weapon is what you want. If a weapon deals 25-50 damage and another deals 30-70 damage then use the 30-70. 
---
But if you see a DPS increase that goes up by like 4 points then use the higher dps. You can test which weapon does better for you based on what Details damage meter says. Or recount. 
---
If you're swords spec always use sword + highest DPS off hand.
---
If you're going dagger use highest damage dagger + highest DPS off hand.
---
Hell. Even calling them script kiddies gives them too much credit.
---
Might get a better market for transmog later, don't miss that opportunity for more gold!
---
Isnt ravager kinda bad unless you are doing alot of dungeons?
---
I think night elf rogue is the best, you can stealth inside your stealth which triggers the X-Files themesong. Can't beat that with any other race.
---
Only in public channels. So in guild or party you should be fine.
---
Thank you!! We are so damn excited.

Downvote phone pics

Get the Spy addon. Allows you to make a list of kill on sight and let's you know if a player is nearby.

Mostly correct.

You accrue rest XP, up to 1.5 levels worth, when logged out OR in an inn.

You accrue rest XP twice as fast when logged out AND in an inn.

You can download pre written DDoS software.

Yes/no. It's bad because sometimes you get stuck doing a whirlwind. It's good because it's a good damage increase over Corpsemaker.

Lololol when will these poorly thought out socialist memes die out.

From the info I gathered you cab ger to a little offered reverred with questing. Does anyone know if the cloth turn in works? Someone said that was phase 2?

Blizzard should really be more protected against this kind of thing

I used to have my own private server. I'm no coder or else I would have put in a blackjack and hookers minigame. Might have to dust that fucker off.

Do you know what shorting is? Do you know how financial derivatives are priced? Buy puts with a strike price of $48, make money on The Greeks, you can be extremely leveraged with options.

In Firemaw, horde only attack when they have 3:1... and even then they find themself cleaning floors. Its like how bad can ya be?
---
It is pretty frustrating. I remember for most of my WoW experience being able to see more than I can now in Classic... bummer not to be able to look out on the landscape.
---
So, like playing videogames in general yes?

go be triggered elsewhere

You still need to get home when you're done.

I've been on for close to 18 hours before, and it's pretty rough.  But I'm a paramedic, so I can usually get a little bit of horizontal time at some point.
---
I'm with ya mate. At around 30g so far at level 32, and will most likely be nowhere near the 90g I'll need at 40 to get the mount. (calculating in the 10% discount for being honored with your faction)
---
sorry that this is a bit random, but could you explain to me why shadoweave robe is better than dreamweave vest? shadoweave ; 7 spirit and up to 21 shadow dmg  
---
dreamweave  : 9 int , 14 spirit , up to 18 spelldmg/heals  
---
both are at the same level so to me the dreamweave set should be the one recommended. is there something i dont get? +3 shadow dmg is so op?

Play what you think is coolest, play the race you like. Its not going to make a big difference, I prefer Orc for the stun resist, it's best for PvP
---
yep, you're still entitled.

I technically wouldn't call it a tie.  druid still edge it out because theirs has no cast time and will remove slows.

It sucks we have to wait for phase 2 üò≠

Nah. You're just on a low pop scrub server.
---
You reached 40 and you can't answer that for yourself?
---
Anything that does miss chance debuffs is a nightmare. Inkspewer murlocs in swamp and elementals in 1k needles both give like 50%+ miss chance which can easily kill you if you're unlucky. Elementals also do heavy magic damage completely melting you.
---
Yes.  But it was considered trash only for other reasons, and people proved that it was strong in all cases.
---
Looks like Elvui. It's an all-in-one UI that's really customizable, easy to setup and sleek looking. I'm not sure if you need a different version for classic or not, I've been too lazy to set up any add-ons.

Pretty sure you just made the argument for Troll.

The reasoning for the denial of service attacks, according to the Department of Justice, was to disrupt other raid competitors, including members of his own raid group for division of loot and raid spots.

"Virtual terrorists" is fucking hilarious.

Most of these high prices are aimed at the twink market. No one leveling has any real reason to buy them, even at a low market price.
---
Yeah but all the fortnite servers have been up all day
---
Fence - 34 Warlock :)
---
I seem to remember from speed levelling vids back in the day that kill quests were the key to fast levelling in classic. Rested XP is only going to make those even more beneficial.
---
Every job comes with it's downsides and hardships. You must not have been working long if you think there's going to be a perfect job out there. Even if you like what you are doing/get paid well, you still have to deal with people, and bad managers are a dime a dozen. 
---
And a big ol' LOL at work life balance being good, maybe if you are in a small company, but not many of the big ones.
---
And everyone else is also silenced so they can't pull threat off your renew.
---
It‚Äôs great! Even when blizzard fucked up and didn‚Äôt confirm OCE server issues for hours the next time it happened they were responding and confirming issues to individual users on twitter within 10 minutes!
---
I get that it's frustrating and a shitty thing they do, it's just from their mindset it's acceptable. We can't understand it so I believe not acknowledging it could be a form of fighting it.
---
Anyway hope I didn't come off sounding too much like a jerk.
---
Of course the only day of the week I can go all out on playing, since Sundays I have the good ol  9-5.
---
The one server I play on is down.
---
Great....
---
It'd be pretty fucking sad if someone posted "Was a dad in 200X, not a dad in 2019 üò¢"
---
Dont let people get you down with comments about having no life.  You enjoy spending your time playing video games and there is NOTHING wrong with that! The people saying that can fu off. ^.^
---
Wow I made a post asking about the same thing and got bombarded by people telling me that I dont understand DDOSING.
---
Ok
---
Hi, /u/vibrationalfreequncy

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d14tq2/i_still_cant_get_into_rattlegore/). 
---
I honestly forgot about it. I haven‚Äôt played heavily since MoP but I don‚Äôt remember ever doing this after classic, maybe BC.
---
Is there any way to just use the chat features of it? 
---
I‚Äôm one of the weird people who like the default interface, but would definitely use the chat features lol
---
Yeah for real. My buddies and I are all playing for the first time in years, started yesterday. Of course the ONE server we have toons on is down lmao
---
Grats dude
---
Not quite, when you blink it resets falling speed
---
You can blink directly onto the ground if you use the spell right before you land 
---
You need to time it a bit
---
Who hurt you?
---
I hope they see this thread and laugh their asses of to you no brainers
---
It's not for you
---
username checks out
---
It's $15 a month.  No other costs.
---
I am having the same, please let me know if you can find a fix.
---
I tried reseting router .
---
IPconfig /renew and IPconfig /flushdns on command page.
---
Will try re-installing Bnet app now.
---
I'm playing on Smolderweb with friends, and so far we've really liked it. Nice community, lots of people around, good PvPing. We're mid/high twenties.
---
Combat swords for pve, daggers for pvp. That simple. Also should have a backup dagger for dungeon backstabbing. I out dps ever combat rogue with duel swords from ambush and backstabbing.
---
I go out to sell boy scout popcorn with my boys.. and I come back to this. 
---
What the fuck life.
---
Yes If you are taking swords in the talent tee under combat. It's an add-on which let's you see your damage! Very handy
---
Its difficult to compare a relatively new launch when everyone is still leveling vs a game that hasn't gotten new content in a couple of months and everyone is at max.
---
Why not try both? The same sub gets you access to both.
---
I took a nap, I should have gone for a run.
---
Orc, my zugga
---
On the other hand: i'm currently at a wedding, so godspeed hackers!
---
You still need a subscription, $13 a month and you get access to retail and classic, including a "free" lvl 110 boost on retail.

"All WoW Realms except Rattlegore are back online and stable. The investigation continues for that realm. Some players may experience persistent login issues until realm maintenance tomorrow morning."
---
Why do when do?
---
Again, In a thread about people working overtime at their software jobs because of the issue lol. Why bring up something that isn't part of the conversation, so annoying and one upperish.
---
Entitled to what? Logging into servers I **pay** for?
---
Are you new to wow? Multi boxing has been around since conception.

yo fuck stop rocks
---
I' mlevel 18 but different server, well good luck and have fun :) I hope you find nice groups where ever you go!
---
What's the consensus on engineering for a priest? Do they need it to be effective/is it s REALLY large bonus? I was planning on combining it with mining, but I'm wondering if I'm better off going tailoring and herbalism for money? (My friend already has enchanting)
---
The endless
---
This guy gets it
---
I leveled in stone talon when the game first released and it was zero percent different. I GTFO quick.
---
Weird.  Definitely shouldn't be.   I think the cloak is the only thing that lasts that long.  Maybe the belt.
---
Why would you push it again while you're already wanding? If you push it while changing targets, it'll wand the new target.
---
Lol that green arrow is hilarious
---
we're horde on kirtonos now
---
And how you know your logging of and  getting ‚Äúrested ‚Äú XP is your level # next to your toon portrait changes to ‚Äúzzz‚Äù :)
---
After playing classic for 2 weeks, I gotta say that I wish spell batching wasnt a thing. VERY annoying. Everything in this post is true. We can only hope people realize this and start asking blizz to remove it.
---
Oops, typo, thanks for the callout
---
It is but you won't it as much.
---
That's a tomorrow problem they said.
---
cumbrain
---
Garbage game.  1 star rating
---
Where did you get this information?
---
My guess is the ddos is responsable. Tomorrow morning after maintainance we should be able to connect, at least I hope. The battle.net app isnt the problem for me as going to battle.net on my browser doesent work either
---
A better way to dissuade future ddosing would be to let everyone impacted by the ddos kick the perpetrator in the balls. 
---
Then post the video to YouTube as a warning. 
---
There would never be another ddos in our life times.
---
Gold? It's not soulbound.
---
Wait a sec, did your hunter leave after the bow didn't drop?
---
rofl, back in BC/WOLK I ran with a guy that played while he drove.... as a trucker.
---
Am I having a stroke or are you???
---
For me personally the only addon I absolutely can‚Äôt live without is bartender. I just can‚Äôt do the blizz default bars. Just... no. (Also I have a razer naga and like to be able to structure the bars to match the layout of the number pad on the side)
---
I also like shadow unit frames and threat plates. Also I had to get questie. Got tired of looking up every second quest on wowhead.
---
Literally both
---
This was the first day that Ive been able to play fully. The kids are out with my wife and I have nothing else to do. Been DC'ed constantly, could barely play this afternoon and keep getting disconnected every 30 minutes now.
---
Such is life
---
I think it is a bit too early to judge an RP server in its leveling phase, but I might be wrong.
---
Why would a hunter even use a cloth item? They don't have a magic or healing spec, do they?
---
thank you!
---
Are you f-ing kidding me?
---
4 manning is often faster than 5 manning with a random retarded dps.
---
Wait you have to RP in public channels? Like trade chat? How is trade even part of the immersion
---
Well yeah. But I use an MMO mouse so I don't actually touch my keys. Even so I'm confused by how he doesn't seem to have all his spells on his action bar. I'm kind of curious though.
---
Someone's gotta let you know that nobody cares
---
It is still a thing in retail , just the leveling is so fast people don‚Äôt think about it
---
I'm not sure if I should continue leveling my priest; I hit a road block at 34. I'm just tired of the monotonous wanding that is leveling. 
---
I like the class; but, other classes seem to carry themselves better. In the past I focused on healers/tanks for their spots in groups. 
---
I am not sure if my lack of motivation is due to an unrealistic expectation of classic; i amused to BC/WotLK. Or if I should be trying another class.
---
Transmog? What transmog?
---
Herod = Horde
---
Interesting how Faerlina came up right away. Rattlegore doesn't matter to Blizz.
---
This is "Terror" as opposed to cyber-vandalism by computer adult-boys with neoteny issues these days.
---
I suppose if you have the image of Blizzard lately any lost money is True Terror.
---
i just put this into a macro called MouseFix or something and click it if my mouse gets fucky. fixes it for me

Definitely a first world problem but I can empathize with him. WoW can be tough to play when free time is limited.
---
I posted this before i knew i could get out, lol
---
Really?
---
100% this
---
You don't need to go to inn, you need to be in a city, that's all.
---
This was more leaning towards my plan. No crazy +3 mobs, but stick to my level, burst them with an ambush gouge backstab opener, eventually with bonus CP talents to evis immediately. Jump from mob to mob bursting 1 at a time, avoiding AoE. Sounds fun, but everyone says combat would be vastly superior, and I don't want to put myself at a huge disadvantage if I'm already playing a slower leveling class.
---
Retail kids
---
Unrelated when European servets got DDoSed as well?
---
Get your head ot of your ass pal.
---
It's a good goddamn game
---
Nope, you can do a cast sequence but each press will only do one spell.
---
Rattlegore is not up for me and my brother and a few of our friends. FFS cmon get it up, 4 hours of trying.
---
I feel ya. been watching it too, and try to get on every now and then, but no luck.
---
Boomers rise up!
---
the murloc one got me lol
---
I have Perl as well lol, now you got me worried. I was actually thinking of uninstalling it so I figured I‚Äôd try to look for an answer for the both of us. Maybe this will help? https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/7549
---
In the advanced troubleshooting it says to try /console cvar_default
---
Let me know if this works for you!
---
A lot of stuff too with the ah cut people should just vendor at this point.
---
For everyone who can't log into rattlegore - Make an alt and log in then log out of it and log into your main. It should work
---
All vanilla stuff looked like that.
---
I got the full set in 2 runs xD
---
&gt;!Murlocs say ^HŒ≠^≈Å≈Å^Œ∏ŒøŒ∏^ŒøŒøŒò¬∞^¬∞^¬∞¬∞!&lt;
---
Anyone else play no mods? I played no mods in vanilla and I'm using a few QoL mods in classic like a big bag and an auto shot timer but that's it
---
Maybe they took a picture to show for friends on the phone also? And since they already took the picture of it, why bother screenshot.
---
At like 37 or so stop questing and just farm.

I mean "Fixed in the sense that the last 14 years of private servers have given people the idea that it exists. I know it wasn't a thing in vanilla, and I'm aware that there's a lot of differences between them :P
---
And yet, it took him 3 and a half hours to do WC.
---
I think that might be illegal in most countries
---
Inns give you the zzz icon as well
---
Dude chill I'm 19
---
wtf one server and it's mine. great
---
Really? So Paladins and Warlocks are SOL until Phase 2 hits (or just have to buy the regular epic mount?)
---
They did give more exposure with that comment though.
---
3/4 can get swapped depending heavily on who stays imo. TBC onwards starts down a path to a different game. If it's mostly hardcore classic fans, there'd be a lot of pushback.
---
Then you don't have empathy in that subject, it's as simple as that. I wouldn't even consider ruining someone's ability to play the game, and when the opportunity is given to me of thinking about it (e.g. this post), it makes me feel sick. And no, it doesn't make me stupidly gut-wrenching sick, before someone decides to exaggerate. My reaction emotionally and logically is it feels bad to consider doing, much less actually doing it. It doesn't matter if it's a video game. It's a person's hobby. And if you think about it even further than that, there are many, many, many people who use video games as a temporary escape from their stress and problems that helps them cope with the world.
---
I think instead of thinking it as overly simple (e.g. "just a video game) to look at it with as many factors and details as you possibly can before deciding whether you give a fuck or not.
---
Email yourself the screenshot or something.

Wikipedia is great, but it's not universally loved. Since it's become as authoritative as it is, there's a huge incentive to color or selectively omit the information on the site in someone's favour. Wikipedia has a group of very strict guidelines and a legion of moderators protecting the articles, but those people also have their biases.
---
Not a huge issue for most users, but it's enough for people to try and set up alternative wikis with non-hierarchical control and moderation structures.
---
I doubt any of that has anything to do why it was DDOSed though.
---
Can‚Äôt tell you how to live your life but that was a dick move
---
My roommate gets in just fine but I cant. Same internet same house

Same. I just get booted from loading bar everytime.

The comment is referring to oral sex

Hahaaa, spoiler alert

I still don't understand how people haven't learned the beauty of Snipping Tool
---
Every time I see someone calling DDoSers "hackers", I feel like that's an insult to actual hackers.
---
Can confirm this works if you're getting the stuck loading screen on the character you got dcd last on.
---
Yea pretty sure its kalimdor...so anyone on that continent...or whatever the affected area is, cant get in. Just finished restarting my comp and gonna try making an undead after one more attempt on my main
---
Yeah you‚Äôre definitely the odd-one-out on this one...
---
I spent so much time messing around when I lvld
---
No regrets
---
:)
---
Yup and if I ever played a rouge it would be I don‚Äôt have the skill then you sol. Then I go back and take it for myself. Your attitude is why people do it. It‚Äôs basically a profession.
---
&gt;all I said was it's not worth just getting shadowburn to tag mobs.
---
Which is not objectively correct. 
---
&gt;  
---
 just that it'll slow you down. 
---
Which you wouldn't know because you've clearly never leveled a warlock destro in classic, and aren't very proficient with the class in general.   
---
&gt; Clearly you know so much 
---
I know, thanks. 
---
&gt; considering you can't even articulate why I'm wrong. 
---
I mean with what you said it's so obvious to anyone who knows anything about the game. It's not my job to teach you lock basics, but sure here's something for you: you suggested it was worth points to improve CoA. Do you have any idea how bad the DPCT is on CoA? If your mobs are living long enough to get the full duration you are doing something VERY wrong, which you are.
---
It's kind of like a good manners thing to pass on things for other classes that can use them. Like passing on rare weapons that your class cant use and you know the other group members will.
---
why not elvui?
---
Burn
---
I‚Äôm actually jealous of the older generations. Times were much simpler. Feels like we‚Äôre being surrounded by chaos 24/7 and the outlook on the future is bleak, also because media loves to blow up negative/fearmongering stories. Makes me want to life off the grid completely.
---
/cast[@mouseover,exists][@player] spell name
---
It‚Äôll cast at the mouseover if it exists and it it doesn‚Äôt it cast it at you.
---
I disagree, I think it is a lot of money.
---
Well he did say he looted it 30 seconds before. Even if it's only 10 seconds it should be fine.
---
I dont think it really is because blizzard saves money. I think it is more because of video game addiction.
---
This is my plan. There are tons of directions this thing might go. I'm just going to hop on and enjoy the ride
---
It doesn‚Äôt get much better. As a caster you‚Äôll always be fighting your own mana bar.
---
Except not like that - a tiny home network with one gigabit isn‚Äôt nearly enough, you‚Äôd need terabits at least. So either botnet or official companies with large infrastructure (who don‚Äôt allow things like this).
---
i'm still unable to connect :/
---
I hate how fast most of the epics/boe blues are.  This would make a great offhand if it wasn't mainhand only.
---
Goldshire is alliance territory.
---
So much yes. Fuck rogues
---
Shamans were always the step child in Vanilla. They had a few shining moments as Enhance with Windury in Pvp.
---
Personally, I also healed a lot of ZG and AQ as Resto spec.
---
Shamans didn't really shine until Burning Crusade.
---
Worked for me as horde. Main is in Ashenvale. Made a new undead, logged into it, logged out, main is available again. Thanks!
---
AITA for doing an obviously non asshole move? Honestly OP we both know and so does everyone else that you did nothing wrong.
---
It, and cloth can roll with some weird stats on them.
---
Is it hard to see the text? No need to get rude over something so trivial
---
Hunter pet tank or no balls
---
I want TBC into WotLK and then new xpacs, personally, but keeping with the classic design mindset.
---
Fucking fantastic
---
Now that's just weird. I was wondering if it was an area specific thing but I guess it is only happening to random people.
---
Oh I had no idea. I know Amazon has pretty decent IT security
---
Idc about the need roll his voice is so damn irritating though
---
That's pretty insensitive. Imagine if some random person decided to shut down your factory and you stopped making money for a while.
---
I know PVP is better but I'm not one to play a lot of PVP, at least for a while. I just wanna stab things in PVE and not feel bad about it :P
---
I think you're super wrong here.  I think it's like a 95% chance they do tbc.
---
They KNOW people like tbc, tbc was more popular than classic by subs and people still talk fondly of it (as well as wotlk) today.  It will take them next to no effort to so tbc and then wotlk and thats not my opinion that's what they have said, classic was all the hard work but now that it's done tbc and cata are a breeze.
---
I can't imagine any company gambling on new content when they essentially know for a fact that they can release content they've already created that will be a huge success and last for years to come.
---
That happened to me yesterday when I had to suddenly leave an Uldaman group when my kid woke up with a nightmare. What a joke some people are.
---
Would you say before level 30 it wouldn't have been a great idea? Looking at the talents, I do think it wouldn't be as great until I at least get Remorseless and Imp. Ambush, which is 24.
---
The Kirin Tor is proud of you :')

We are on the server Sulfuras! If you want to join us, send me a message and I'll give you more info.

As a fellow horde player, we both know we do that shit too.

Yeah it's called the base UI.

Probably x Pearl idk

Tirisfal has a really deep bass track that is kind of always droning. It sounds amazing if you have a decent sound system. Sounds like maybe it is a little outside the scope of your systems capabilities and is coming through poorly.

I can't seem to be able to connect to Battle Net, how are you guys logging in?

I did say often, not always.

Perhaps his group were the rejects that couldn't get another group.

It‚Äôs actually the best way for you guys to level since you will be casual...in a pvp server people will often never engage the duo groups in the world

You feel normal.

Now that's a picture I haven't seen in a long...long time.

It can dispel blessing of protection, which only works on physical attacks, not divine shield or ice block.
---
Problem is TBC definitely breaks classic design mindset.
---
Classic is kind of a wonderful mistake, but in smoothing out the problems the game became something different. You can't just slap TBC in and still consider it classic design imo.
---
I‚Äôm just made that my server went down in the middle of an escort quest. Not just any escort quest mind you, but the one that goes from the Northwatch Hold all the way to Ratchet. We were only 30 feet away from finishing the quest.
---
No it usually takes them a bit to get everything back to normal after a DDOS attack.
---
Right click your portrait. Select Unlock Frame. Move it to where you want. Right click again to lock.
---
Is it even open to let non-transfers roll there yet?
---
It‚Äôs not possible to hit exalted by questing even if you did every Darnassus quest in the game. You can get to about 5000/21000 revered and then you have to turn in rune cloth.
---
perhaps, I've just been wanting to grind lvls so i can hit 40 and finally learn artisan leatherworking. i've spent too much gold to be denied the ability to do so.
---
700+ i know atleast 3 in my realm that would insta buy for 600 and we currently have 5 in the ah ranging from 800-1k

Unless unless it drops silk, I've murdered dozens of mobs for no reason other than 30% chance to drop silk

ah yeah, not just rebinding the rest of the bottom left bar instead of leaving it half empty is pretty weird.

4chan cares about wow. They will get to the bottom of this
---
Worked for me too!  Southkai94, may your son be masculine child.
---
Lol fuck this guy and his guild. Losers.
---
Just give it time. Its all you can do.
---
I mean its not much different than a TV show or movie or stand up comedian, it's all just someone putting on a show to entertain. If you dont find it entertaining then that's fine, but it doesnt mean other people cant. Also a lot of people who do have depression or bad lives like streamers because it feels more personal when you are both there in live time. Streamers realize that too and try to stream on schedule even if they really dont want to because they know people rely on them.
---
What do you mean viable?
---
It's a meme spec with niche use cases. Also, unlike on pservers, Reckoning is removed on mounting, so you can't even do the meme charge stacks and run up and 1 hit someone.
---
It makes you a rogue's worst enemy, that's about it.
---
Imagine being in federal prison for ddosing world of Warcraft servers for a few days. What a moron.
---
Are you using a different font btw? Looks nice
---
Maybe. I finally came across someone else who told me they had to turn down their sound to not hear it. I have pretty nice speakers... I just assumed something wasn't calibrated correctly. Cause yeah - some ppl have no idea what i'm even talking about which makes me think it's not as noticable when it's set up correctly? or something like that. I get what you're saying.
---
Weapons are just a stat stick for ferals.
---
that might be your internet
---
Only 3 classes level faster than a priest, as they are one of the most efficient.  Level 30-40 is significantly slower and more monotonous than 10-30/40-60 due to no lower wand damage per mob hp, no shadow form and more reliance on survivability than damage.  The biggest question is, what are you interested in doing end game.  PvP?  Shadow is great for 1v1s and OK for battlegrounds, disc/holy is great for battlegrounds.  PvE?  Unless you have a ticket in a guild as a shadow priest you'll be healing, are you looking to heal end game?

Who dis?
---
The difference is blizzard is providing a nearly unmatched level of server access and scale in comparison to trying to sell you a my little pony gun skin only to take it away from you and sell it to you again.
---
It's a 15 year old game and it hasn't changed. It's a great model that more games need to go back to.
---
There are no MTX.
---
You are rude. I pointed out 60/40 is a bigger split than you think it is. That is enough to make it painful while leveling in contested areas force alliance into dungeons to level making it worse. Calling me an idiot is fine.
---
Ass.

I ak not into macros but maybe you need to use quotation marks because of the white spaces like [worm:"Strong Fishing Pole"]

So if there's an engineer in the group does everyone get to roll on locked chests too?

So many nostalgia guilds out there

---
Appears to be continent based.  Creating alts for Orc/Troll/Tauren as a Tauren in Ashenvale did not resolve the issue.  Creating an undead alt did fix it.
---
So either it's only undead that fixes it, or it needs to be an alt on the other continent.
---

In Badlands there are rock elementals that drop lots of vendor trash that stacks, as well as elemental earth and solid stone. Elemental Earth's sell for 75s to 1.25g while solid stone was selling for 2g a stack. Just farm til bags are full vendor trash send stones and Earth's to a bank alt.
---
Right. At level 60 you‚Äôll be doing about 6% dps of a Rogue or Warrior.
---
it isn't. Using it as we speak.
---
In early vanilla reckoning was broken and had no cap. As such paladins could do bananas things with it like one shot kazaak 
---
This is not the case in classic as we are post reckoning nerf. Ret is generally seen as a meme spec - you do less dps then every other dps spec but also bring crap utility. That's why every raiding paladin was holy
---
It absolutely depends on what you want from the game. It's important to find your balance in playing optimally and playing how you want. Do you even want to join guilds that wouldn't take you in as a Night Elf Priest? I personally wouldn't. WoW is so much larger than just playing the meta builds.

But I totally get where you're coming from. I was in the same exact place, hating the fact that I was going to play Dwarf. Thankfully, we ended up going Horde and now I'm in love with the Forsaken. :) But with the knowledge I have now,  I would roll Human or NE Priest over Dwarf, 100%. Anyone who wouldn't invite me over that is a person I wouldn't want to play with anyway.
---
Dw just transmog it! Oh..
---
Ok so if I log out in Stormwind but NOT in an Inn does that still give the bonus xp at the same rate as if i were in an Inn?
---
HF is nice in that you regen while casting it.
---
Man fuck all those people telling you to get a life. I‚Äôm married and have a great life and I was considerably bummed to have my Rattlegore go down
---
Why does no one know how to screenshot anymore?
---
I am in the same boat. Fianc√© and I play priest/mage. We do just fine and it‚Äôs really fun. My shield bubbles help her with pushback from casting, we wand stuff down together, worst case scenario one of us can heal and soon she will have the ability to port us to major cities. Very excite.
---
The issue is people are scared of transferring. If enough people transferred that there would never be a queue, the receiving server wouldn't be low pop. It would most likely be medium or maybe even high.
---
Exactly why I chose not to play on a pvp server, rogue running around 20+ levels higher than those he‚Äôs killing.
---
Casting rotation is less important that your mana spending (inside 5s rule) rotation.
---
I think the confusion here is the difference between "Classic" and "Vanilla" mindsets. Vanilla, for one reason or another, was an undesigned game. Due to time crunch, logistical issues or the fact that everything is new means that some things just... don't function. Paladin's don't have spells to do damage, for some reason. They have 1 button and auto attacks, they were undesigned.
---
Classic mindset, as I see it, is a game designed around community interaction, rock hard gameplay and obstinate decisions. As in, Priest; you're going to wand. End of story. Forever. It's not undesigned, but it's rooted in tbe Vanilla mythos that made Vanilla amazing. Vanilla was undesigned, and that got changed with TBC and WotLK to some extent, but both of those expacs still tried to maintain the "Classic" mindset.
---
Tldr; Classic mindset is a community focused mmorpg based around rock-hard challenges and obstinate game design that works, Vanilla mindset is similar, but surrounding a game that wasn't designed by people, more a loose collection of sleep deprived robots. Still great, but community and challenge is why we're here, not necessarily because Vanilla being poorly designed was fun.
---
I made about 50g is 6 hours, and without selling the Earth's and stones.
---
I have Quartz, but for some reason I can only see buff timer if im targetting myself
---
Yeah, I did a bit of reading and learned it wasn't a self given name, and I thought "ah, that makes much more sense."
---
&gt;Bear is Russia
---
Alright.
---
&gt;China is Panda
---
Makes sense.
---
&gt;Iran is Kitten
---
Pardon?
---
Did they run out of apex predators by the time they got to Iran or are their attempts at cyber warfare just cute?
---
As someone who has played since BC with more /played than I care to know, I kinda wanna die rn
---
When I played vanilla I had this really nice Klipsch sound system hooked up to my pc, and the ambience in tirisfal was amazing. Now I mostly play on my gaming laptop, and I literally cant hear it at all on the system speakers. I am thinking that's why most people have no idea what you are talking about. I am thinking unless you have a dedicated sub it is just taxing your mid range channel and sounding off.
---
Its a complete UI override and I would have to reset EVERYTHING (its just a hassle)
---
I cant imagine
---
100% agree. I played from vanilla to mist and TBC was the pinnacle of WoW for me. No question
---
For the Horde!
---
Honestly, I intend to get my hands on a ravager axe also on my hunter, provided am not taking it from a dps warrior or pally.
---
It‚Äôs a very good weapon for its level while leveling and questing, lets be honest here, pets don‚Äôt hold threat all that good, and if you are taking on 2 mobs and one is on you, it‚Äôs easier to just melee that mob while your pet holds the 2nd one.
---
Kiting and spamming consussive shot is very mana draining. Not to mention we can‚Äôt drop traps in combat, so can‚Äôt just freeze trap something that‚Äôs beating on you. 
---
Just because we are mainly a ranged class, doesn‚Äôt mean we don‚Äôt get stuck in melee combat often. Having a strong melee weapon for those shitty situations is mandatory.
---
I even have my macros setup already
---
Wingclip + raptor strike 
---
And 
---
Mongoose bite + raptor strike
---
just go download something you like the look of on wago.io
---
Well done. 
---
My friend and I used to sit outside of the entrance of Black Rock spire.  I was a gnome rogue and he a night elf priest.  He would shadow meld and I stealth and sap, the ln he would mind control the hordies into the lava.  It was so much fun knowing the people on the other end of the screen would start yelling "no!  No! Noooooo!...."  As their bodies jump into the farthest reaches of the lava below.
---
Such satisfaction.  Ahhhhh the good ole days.
---
Had my first bad WoW classic experience earlier when a group freaked out because a class rolled on something that another class expected as theirs.  Sad.
---
Just wait till he kills your family, you wont be laughing then, pussy.
---
Do you still paint ? I would buy this if you can recreate it .
---
 ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
How do people not have at least enough gold to get their 40 mount? Are people buying overpriced greens every few levels or something?
---
Base values are, but market values I think are okay.
---
I actually only found out about it in Mists, when I - as legally obligated - created a Panda Monk and was looking up how best to abuse the free XP bonuses they got every 10 levels.
---
There's "Healing done" and "Overhealing done" but how do you combine them? I've seen streamers have green and red bars, green being *actual* healing, red being overheal, and green+red being total healing.
---
Fack you and you bad words
---
The quests to get your class mount are P2, you can still get a standard 1k gold mount though.
---
Peladophobian.... is that you?
---
Let the 2 hour ques begin!!!!
---
Generally RP guild names are seen as try hard.
---
My Autism meter is dead on thanks for proving me correct :)
---
The difference is the game time played. They're putting in way more hours
---
I actually had one the other night bitching me out for killing "his mobs"  when I was doing the quest for them.  Repeatedly to the point where I just /ignored him.  
---
I did try to explain that I was doing the quest and would be gone soon but he just kept insisting he was entitled to the area because it was the densest area for them...
---
I knew it
---
Yeah but I've been such a dork with this game that I only have like 2 bars of rested at most anyway, lol.
---
2 bars is still nice 40+ though, I guess.
---
U see his mana?
---
Welcome to Classic? This always happened.
---
THATS A FUCKING 50DKP MINUS
---
I still can't log-in on any oceanic realms. (Dath'Remar on retail, nor Remulos on classic). :( No. 51900328
---
There was a guy forget his name but he held a dueling tournament, all 60‚Äôs. That was on ER. Good times.
---
It's nice now that the server queues are finally starting to taper off. Getting home at 5 and having a 7hr queue to start playing wasn't fun
---
Yeah
---
Hehehe Dumpus
---
Really i thought its only like $60 for one year and this still would be very expansice if you also want to play it for another year. There is no game worth more than $60 and you can only play it for 4 mohts. Come on man $180 for a yearly subscription is just ridiculous as f. I really didnt know tha it is so expansive. This is really next level lmao.
---
Activiosn is stupid rich. They are so rich man they making tons of money lmao
---
Blizzard just needs to find a way to make transferring really attractive. Stalagg still has 2-3 hour long queues (minus today with the DDOS issues). Even if half of the 8k queue would transfer the server would be off to a great start. And that's only 1 of the servers that are transferring to Heartseeker. If the other did the same it'd be approaching full status as well.
---
*cries in warlock*
---
Happy cake day! And you‚Äôre right. It is. 1300 hours in and I can‚Äôt stop
---
Offer it as tribute to Hobbs
---
I've been online, uninterrupted, since I posted last.
---
Try cleaning it from time to time
---
Why would he be full of shame?
---
Though bordering on apophasis to forfeit blame, which is fair.
---
Really well, ended up taking a few hours but got there in the end. It was worth the wait, I'm now a 25 Troll Shammy
---
I absolutely love that boomer v zoomer memes are taking over classic wow.
---
Sweet I'll test it out
---
I heard you also get it if you're dead.
---
Woah, you actually managed to kill level 30s as a level 53 rogue? Congrats man those seals must have been really tiring to club.
---
There is one reason i play a rogue here but never in retail: it seems the aggro of everything has gone up from about 30 feet to half of kalimdor!
---
F-mega
---
Sounds like you answered your own question.
---
Thank you! It's called "Power Hour UI", a guy created it with a bunch of different mods and created a tutorial on youtube. I added some mods and changed out some for personal preferences. The video on youtube is  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K1bUAilgIg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K1bUAilgIg) 
---
I definitely recommend it, it works great! I personally would change out Bagnon for Ark Inventory, it has amazing sort functions and is super easy once you learn how to use it.
---
You got 50 kills in an hour ganking grey people trying to level that stood no chance at all?
---
Pretty bad ass bro. 
---
My favorite part of your vid was at the 34 minute mark where you got shit on and laughed at.
---
üç™
---
While it helps you only gain 1 bubble(5% of a level) per 8 hours rested inside of a major city or inn. So it's not like you have lost levels worth of xp at this point.
---
It was in vanilla. It's probably one of the most reposted quests on this sub as well.
---
Looks like that‚Äôs the law in the UK, not the US
---
No other class has to spend 10+ hours doing what you mentioned like a rogue does for lockpicking.
---
Training a skill at a trainer is way different than lockpicking.
---
So it wasn‚Äôt the Sheffeild guy that everyone was spamming on facebook? Feel bad for that guy then
---
Thanks for all your help!
---
Right?? I hate that things can be totally immune to frost, it makes the quest pretty much impossible solo.
---
Oof but it had to be fairytale. Cesspool of scum and villany and terrible instance fraternity, blah blah
---
'Trading Places' was a great movie
---
My power has been out all day because of Dorian. I guess they picked a decent time for me.
---
Is there a way to precisely arrange the bars though? I like the way Dominos looks but I remembered only being able to click and drag without any coordinates or a grid.
---
How can they be bad for the market? Please explain how fast sales for the seller and cheap prices for the buyer could possibly be bad. 
---
If the prices are below production, he won't sell at that price forever. If they are above production but not as high as youd like, it's time for you find a new market, bc you can't compete
---
Yes
---
Hug your little bro for me
---
someone from america cheats: "wow what an asshole hope he gets a ban"
---
someone from china cheats: "well aktually did you know it's considered GOOD to cheat in china?"
---
literally see this every day on reddit its laughable
---
Oh wow congrats on killing people who cant fight back. Theres a reason the horde are mud hut dwellers, honor my ass!
---
In fairness the Warlock spate on the Warrior. The warlock started the disrespect
---
I actually saw him start it and followed him and helped him complete it, then I used /beg and he followed me while I started it, then tanked for me! It all went very smoothly haha
---
I mean, I was under the impression that the "tax evasion" in the Panama papers was legal. You're allowed to move funds through shells to tax havens. Hell, Apple alown has hundreds of billions stored offshore

Are you in defensive stance
---
This means it's a server/software bug?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ9Lt0LYiUI

it's from a video tho
---
I still replay old Zelda games and The Last of Us from time to time.  This is hardly any different, except I get to play with my friends, too.
---
I can say for certain that in my group of friends, at least 12 of us made new subscriptions
---
Of those , 2 are playing WoW for the first time ever
---
And we‚Äôve got 3 more potential buddies on deck waiting to play for the first time
---
Ok...
---
Warrior defensive stance.
---
Lololol imagine thinking it‚Äôs priests jobs to stop whatever they are doing while questing to Rez you, how pathetic
---
Actually me and my fianc√© saw someone stuck in there so we started to laugh really hard about it, the poor guy couldn‚Äôt get out and just afk there giving up in life, however I wonder how he got in there so I started to mess around and after a few attempts I landed inside. I was shock, the only thing that went thru my mind was fuck...my hearth stone is down and I‚Äôll have to wait around 30-40m to be able to hearth, but after numerous attempts of jumping out, there‚Äôs this little edge you can wall jump and I was free from that trap after 10-15m of been trap.
---
I enjoy retail but also been playing classic
---
They might've been worried that "virtual terrorists" included people stealing passwords or other information from them, not just ddosing.
---
Bruh?
---
I get this reference
---
But complaining about it gives them all the reason in the world to continue.    Ignore them   or you are begging for them to continue. 
---
This gives them the attention they crave.  it was the whole reason they did it.   Learn how to deal with trolls.. feeding them never works.
---
Oh... yes, haha thanks
---
happens, i mostly aoe grinded but did so in groups and that cuts gold 3 ways but doesnt cut exp by the same amount it seems, this is why getting your mount should be judged by time played not level, but that is too complicated to track and level is a good rough indicator.
---
Ever wonder why the PVP community has such a bad reputation?  It's you.
---
you saw how to fix it? create undead char?  read the this thread about it
---
The only time a DDOSer gets to the CIA is when they're delivering pizzas to it.
---
To me it looks like a hood/top of a robe that a mage just disappeared from and just left a spark
---
haha it must have cost him a solid coin to put that up.
---
Nope
---
It's kind of mind boggling that there will be 2-4 mages in an area fighting over the mobs and none of them realize that it makes the whole thing entirely pointless lol
---
REEEEEEEE We all knew this.... everyone of us is following the news. You're just a retard that didnt Google info and expected us to let you know. Glad you found out how to look for things. Were not your fucking information desk!
---
Overall, I plan on healing end game. My main goal is to get Benediction as it looks amazing. I plan to dabble with Shadow pvp, but mostly healing.
---
Be a while before its worth anything
---
when you go through the dm quests you talk to the master of cheese in stormwind. He says something along the line of: ‚Äûyea sure next you are going to tell me deathwing is alive and attacking the city‚Äú
---
What do you mean they've released the same madden game for 20 years
---
Trump tweeted about it
---
Lol, how long did you last before World chat scared you off?
---
Your name is remarkably similar to that of the sellers.
---
Actually earn the gear please.
---
Depends what you want from a game, if you want a multiplayer RPG then it‚Äôs not good, if you want a competitive dungeon-arena simulator with leaderboards to push then you will like it more.
---
Yeah... collecting tips is sure a huge benefit to a profession that takes longer to level than any primary or secondary profession in the game...
---
If you want to justify it any way you can do what you want because rogues don't have much leverage since they're the least desired dungeon dps, but know that you're basically charging the rogue for the run at that point, by expecting them to level a skill primarily for the benefit of the group.
---
On Faerlina Alliance and it's the same thing, very demoralizing indeed.  A lot of people going to be jumping ship to Horde or PvE servers when Phase 2 hits and people actually have an incentive to world PvP.
---
This post the equivalent of Jared from Subway walking into a PTA meeting
---
Yeah of course mr smarty.  they didnt hack anything of course you know more than me.  You must work at blizzard or something you can make a definite conclusion about something you don't know about.

try r/fortnitebr or r/competitivefortnite or a better number count

Child‚Äôs play. Now join the big boys and do it through a straw into a cereal bowl

kingdom hearts releases every console and makes millions

nothing like setting some pleb up to take the fall.  spoofing and using compromised accounts is just the way the game is played.

how often have you seen that possible. Looking to get my mage up to farm good, but there seems to be so many that I fear it wont be worth it because of the fierce competition
---
yes but these games are different from a MMO.
---
I have a level 30 priest and 19 warrior and I'm playing 12 hours a day :&lt;
---
Just when you thought you heard them all.
---
Bingo
---
How much do you play?
---
Because they play 10+ hours a day.
---
Its because loads of people are checking to see if servers are back up lmao
---
This is a lie no lowbie needing help true Silverpine have 10g.
---
There is an animation, it shows up above the head.
---
Imagine doing 8 years in prison to tell people, ‚ÄúI took down world of Warcraft for 4 hours.‚Äù
---
LOL
---
Because you don't know how to use print screen.
---
Lmao the salty people in this thread
---
My level 16 classic lock would have rested experience through level 60 if that were true.
---
Glad to hear other people are using MB to get spirit tap.  Any tips on getting the timing right?
---
Honey is a free world of warcraft addon that will let you compare your vendor price to those on the auction house for sweet savings.
---
So auctioneer basically
---
Both of our rotations end with wand. Not sure what your comment helps tbh.
---
(Must preface this by saying this is my first time playing WoW so I don‚Äôt know anything about which are the good/best items or anything)
---
Two questions, how does disenchanting something net you 15g?! Also, this item is worth more than 15? How much is it approximately?
---
That‚Äôs true, and I definitely appreciated being able to play many hours that my group of friends can‚Äôt (being weekdays) but since I work so many damn hours over the weekend I couldn‚Äôt play with them. Playing with friends is always more fun.
---
Is in a pvp server, Warlock walks towards alliance town not like it was an odd patrol that caught him, warlock spits on warrior first before the warrior be's BM. Warlock gets up and doesn't lose to a warrior because he ain't AFK.
---
I'm seeing it, just see no karma, if the warrior was smarter he would have 1-checked for a soulstone, 2-ran away after first fear and wasted irrelevant CD's. Karma is a positive reward for good actions and negative reward for bad actions, this was kind of neither.
---
Kick these loot whores out of your groups, people.
---
he could be playing alliance...
---
Went onto 4chan for information. Learned nothing, stumbled onto some fucking 3d fake kid porn, remembered why I don't go on 4chan, closed it out

---
Your deposit is determined on the item you post, not how much you list it for.
---
Never gonna happen.
---
Just start. If there's competition then stake your claim. If you're on a PvP server and they're cross faction, kill them. AoE farming will always be viable, doesn't matter if it's now or at the end of the expansion.
---
Spirit tap bro:) im full mana again by the time i mind blast the next mob. You must be doing something wrong.
---
People have a tendency to exaggerate their struggles and accomplishments when they know there's nobody around to call them on it.
---
It can (and it most likely will if you have 4 stacks), but only once. Seal of Righteousness procs every time, thus it always does more damage with Reckoning.
---
Is the talent Spiritual Guidance bugged or something? I respecced holy today at 46, figured I'll try to grind some dungeons, maybe to 52 and start doing BRD, maybe just for a few levels for a change of pace.
---
And although I have 200 spirit, which should get me like 50 +healing, my DejaCharacterStats says I have +250 healing now. I have like 80 from my gear. It's not just a bugged addon, because I'm actually getting all that +healing on my spells.
---
Is the talent bugged, or is there something I'm missing? I should have like 130 +healing at the most in my gear and talents.
---
Brb gonna post this on facebook.
---
They finally added crusader strike? Thank the light!
---
It's even better if the rogues level 20 and got help from his friends to do the poison quest bang on level 20.
---
Renting a botnet is lower than that, they can come with GUIs and technical support. The only knowledge needed in the whole thing is where to find and pay for it.
---
Don't they have to damage them somehow otherwise they leash back to their patrol point?
---
Seriously. Whoever is making these needs a raise lmao
---
Rag is a pug boss.
---
What?
---
Does this help people remember? Affecting is a verb and knowing that should make it fairly obvious lol.
---
Looks like the Southpark wow plsyer
---
Too soon
---
You can‚Äôt taunt the vast majority of bosses, and therefore would only get threat after 3/4 of the dps dies after the mt drops.
---
That was always my feeling. There's the interesting team of monsters. And then there's the team of Frank, short Frank, short Frank with a beard, and Talandor Whisperwind. I don't have anything against Alliance players really. I just think that faction is a lot more boring.
---
I had my first queue today because if this :(
---
Lol imagine expecting people to be able to read your mind.   You never said you were questing.
---
Retail has told much stuff around the core game for me to really love it. Get rid of all the wearable type crap, pet battles, turn waterfronts into a real bg ques from the pvp lfg and I may be able to tolerate it more but in its current form I hit 120 ran all the raids once and just dont feel the pull to log on.
---
LFM mage/lock SM AoE exp farm! PsT!
---
My man!
---
Yea MMO games are based around the adventure and exploring. Where is the adventure and exploring of an MMO when the game has been solved?
---
It'll happen
---
How you are only level 20 is the real shocker. That‚Äôs like 6 hours of play time.
---
Thr fact it's called the CLEFT of Shadow  should have been the red flag here lol.
---
You can leave the chat channel
---
Set your hearthstone to Brill. Great place to vendor/repair and logout for the night. Zeppelin is right there for Org/STV as well and it‚Äôs closer to SM than UC.
---
Your artwork is fantastic, keep it coming.
---
Alt + Ctrl + F2 + K + Num pad 3 + Pg Down + ~
---
They could be utilizing other services, but most likely they're for support things (like the websites, possibly some of the DDoS protection layers, etc), where it does make fiscal sense to use someone else's hardware, but the requirements for the main games are very likely way above what is economically feasible for renting, given that each "server" is a cluster unto itself just to run, let alone any disaster mitigation.
---
yea he only got WORLD FIRST.sucha waste thou
---
Don't pre shield unless very full mana. Just HF, MB, then swp (shield/ regen). This has a 1.5 sec long mana spending , honestly u can fit an easy smite in after the HF and keep your mana up easy.
---
I would think free character transfers off a dead server would happen before actual merging. Better for everyone.
---
Everybody already knows what they gotta do. Now its just a race to the top
---
I imagine playing WoW for more hours than people work regularly... Oh shit
---
I‚Äôve noticed that these twink items are dropping left and right. And people are hoarding them like crazy for phase 3. Makes me wonder if they‚Äôll even be worth all that much once BGs are out.
---
Elemental Earth goes for like 50s on Herod right now. Not worth to sell at all. But the vendor trash is pretty good. I farm them in Arathi as the elementals in Badlands are usually contested.
---
For me personally, classic is about the exploration and the community. I want to level my characters, chat with other people, etc.
---
I want to experience the things I've missed when I was a child. I began playing in TBC as an absolute noob and never managed to get through a single raid (except for Gruul which would have been cleared even without me). So what I want from classic is to experience the old AV, play the classic open world PvP, go through the old classic endgame dungeons that I've never experienced. And maybe, go through some classic raids. But for actual progression I'm hoping on TBC. Doing the attunments, going through the heroics, etc.
---
You're definitely not the asshole, PvP isn't always nice and you were even killing them to help out others.
---
While most of the time I'm not attacking grey hordies this can change the instant they fight another ally or if their name/guild is on my shitlist.
---
But that is what PvP is about, you can be questing around the same guy for an hour and the moment another guy takes a shot at you he joins in, you ride by an skull and he decides that a quick backstab and remounting is worth his time.
---
Be the asshole you want to be but be prepared for the consequences, because there is always a bigger fish... or a swarm of smaller piranhas ready to take you on.
---
And the average person playing Classic won't be pugging Rag, even in P5.
---
My PC runs Classic better than it did private servers. The 1.12 client is just horrible optimized.
---
Yeah it's not something that you have to do, it's just a nice bonus.
---
The ddos has zero impact on threat...

Not at all, but that wouldn't be implementing TBC would it?
---
I'm not a "no changes" type. I'm a "Classic+ instead of TBC please" type.
---
They totally were when windfury could proc off itself. A good 2h'er and you'd easily be in the top ~10 dps. 
---
I don't think that's a thing in classic though.
---
Or neglect the job, spouse and kids sadly.
---
Where was he rude? Wtf and this shit isn't being rude. Me calling you a fucking idiot is being rude.
---
I think they will. Everyone who gets to 60 will do Rag at one point or another.
---
It you!
---
*glances at Varimathras*
---
Because it was a very fun and well-timed grenade.  It may not be incredibly special but is definitely a fun moment.
---
Why play any old game then. Literally every game these days is mapped out with online resources within months.
---
I know everyone here has a real hate-on for *all* streamers regardless of their content or personality, but Esfand seems like a pretty neat dude.
---
That was quashed.
---
Do a search in willitclassic.com
---
That's not classic
---
Draenei in a classic thread????
---
Almost 60 then it's time to camp your alliance harbor:)
---
Yeah let‚Äôs play some BFA and post it on the Classic subreddit!
---
Not really.
---
I thought you could scale the UI through classic controlls/interface?
---
Lol random chance of getting gold. This is the true mindset of a horde player. The joy isnt in gaining gold. Its the fact that someone would give it. People over money, in life and in warcraft. For the fucking alliance boys
---
Imagine every player being horde and taking your farming spots with no way to kill them, the horror.
---
I just dont understand the streamer thing, why watch someone else play when you could be playing.
---
Anyone who is die-hard either way is a douche. Enjoy gaming. Shut up.
---
You can always try playing off hours for your server.   I notice more competition at the day goes on.
---
Ye
---
1-24 is short in terms if hours /played to 60. More important that you enjoy playing your class all the way to post 60 content
---
Staves +2    
---
Just...why? Who auto attacks with staves and wears leather and uses intellect and nature damage? A druid will use spells or forms. A shaman but that's a big maybe because at 20 you get two-handed axes and maces so...
---
I'm sad that you didn't eat his corpse.
---
Wrong thread man..
---
Saying wtf is this shit when someone shows you something is rude, especially when it really doesn't matter at all you fucking mong
---
So do your aoe fear and the mage won't be able to aoe AND it might pull more than they can handle
---
No you definitely are
---
Also, why are we even discussing and arguing over what class benefits from this weapon like if we were discussing raid loot, this item is not even pre-raid bis.
---
Anyone that can get use out of it while leveling can have it for all I care.
---
The less you play while still paying the more money they theoretically make
---
Weak
---
Did not do any professions, skipped LOTS of spells, didn‚Äôt not spend anything on the AH and posted any valuables I could. Looted every corpse and sold everything. I did not have enough gold until level 42. I think my biggest expense was paying mages 10 silver every time I asked for water.
---
Me too thx
---
Can someone explain it to me
---
How do I make sure my drivers are up to date. This is my first computer
---
Check ur dm

---

Ah I see, try making sure your drivers are up top date with geforce experience.
---
How?
---
Just Google geforce experience how to update drivers.
---
Checked out op's profile, someone has a grudge against the horde to a degree that they're willing to put this much effort into a fake account. 
---
Amazed every day what this game is capable of.
---
Ok thanks mate
---
Ooo yay its Orlyia. Used to work with her at the Austin office. Shes like a chain smoking older lady who doesnt put up with anyones shit. Glad to see shes still there assuming its the same one.
---
Fire!  Im about to have a child as well.  V excited to play with baby next to me haha
---
Jesus christ this subreddit is pathetic
---
What is the likelihood he just found someone on Facebook and used their email?
---
I understand your point but being terroized and being inconvenienced are wildy sifferent things.
---
yeah it can carry you all the way to ZF runs
---
I expected a whole pile of people throwing mud at retail and so far 12 replies and not a one. Huh!
---
Thanks for the level reply .. damn it, I feel the draw. 
---
If only WoW in VR were a thing..
---
Vanilla horde, forced alliance at BC because college friends. Convinced my friends now to go horde and I couldn't be happier. I liked the Ironforge / Goldshire experience but prefer the horde zones.
---
Oh man that's rough.
---
Tongueless bears, bloodless lions, ichorless spiders.
---
It's been awhile since I looked through it proper(there was so much to it) and there was illegal activity but the majority of them were abusing "legal" loopholes.
---
Still, the scope and quantity of people and money involved should have sparked a global uproar but like most things the public interest in it died after a week or two. Much like how there was no real story when countries reneged on vows to cancel arms sales to SA after the Khashoggi murder as it had burnt out public interest by that point.
---
Then again the only people we can really blame is ourselves, we're still too comfortable to care.
---
Don't use the Tram! Just tested it on a lower level character and the same thing happens.
---
Rumor is that the next exp will be in the shadow realm or whatever so who knows

---
You will be okay but dont expect to run all the addons and get 60fps.
---
You would still get a better weapon than one with zero stats.  Just finishing the sm quest gets you bonebiter which comes with stats.  If you really want to do the spinny thing, cool whatever.
---
What server is this lmao
---
Why should Flash Heal never be used? I find myself using it quite a lot in dungeons cuz it's so quick.

heh ty for long answer

I watched this 30 times, awesome
---
How do you know that ?
---
You presume too much about why WoW has guards. They don't stop lvl 60s from killing quest NPCs. You think Blizzard wanted lvl 60s to attack quest hubs, but not lvl 30s?
---
Bingo, its someone with a couple of bitcoins to blow because it can and will bother the people who are effected. They didn't do anything except send out bitcoins.
---
I‚Äôm laughing way too fucking hard right now

Wait, they are!? *mind blown*
---
Ans you presume guards killed wpvp when there was PLENTY of wpvp regardless of guards. BGs did more to kill wpvp than guards ever did.
---
Let the goon have his fun :‚ñ°
---
What bag add on is that
---
It's more expected in /say or /yell to be in character, but general and trade aren't really expected as much as it is just polite. 
---
The people who RP can leave general/trade chats, but they can't leave /say and /yell.
---
" People over money" You mean like how I said I would rather play with the gay cracking jokes?
---
Arms. TacMas &amp; Anger Managment are must haves.

But yeah, stick with 2hers. Try and get ahold of Corpsemaker from RFK and then the WW Axe asap.

How'd you get elite playerframe to work?
---
It stops Auto Shot from being turned off if you press it again.
---
The default Auto Shot spell in your Spell Book will toggle on/off each time you press it.
---
If you make a macro that is simply
---
    #showtooltip
---
    /use !Auto Shot
---
You could spam the button and not stop shooting.

How am I projecting anger? I'm just saying that pretty much every non rogue in this thread is going through mental hoops to justify forcing the rogue to open chests for them, trying to pretend it's something more than that.  Indeed your attitude in this comment is exactly what I'm talking about.  Give me money or gtfo attitude.
---
It's pretty laughable.

Yes, capital cities apply the rest exp.  Usually a little bit after you enter a city it'll start giving you rest exp if you didn't have any (i.e. when it says "You feel well rested" or whatever).

Same my battle net just says cant connect and I need to install the game.... internet is fine though... there's like nothing online about it and everyone else seems to be able to get on wow just not play :/

Some people would blame the skid that is running the attack, a more enlightened view might be to blame Activision. What serious company allows it's golden goose product to be taken offline by a teenager with a crummy botnet? 
---
Amazon would laugh at an attack like this.

thank you so much!

A few warriors with Intimidating Shout would make one hell of a pool table game out of that.

Honestly, I dont know but I doubt it.

It's a 10 yr max prison sentance for each conviction... So if this guy DDOS attacked wow, wikipedia, twitch, Xbox and Playstation, he could get a life sentence. Mind blowing stupidity.
---
As the other commenter said, you can only level so fast with DE'ing in each tier. You'll need to do part of it by actually enchanting items. As you level up you'll also need to make sure you're DE'ing higher level items to keep getting experience as well.
---
It's not never used, just only I'm emergency situations because of it's short cast time, it is more reactionary.  It should be used sparingly because of its low efficiency, high cost low effect.  I would be anticipating incoming damage more and have heal or greater heal casting already, rather than ripping flash heal in response to damage taken.  In raids you wont be able to keep up. In dungeons if you use it too much you will be oom quickly.
---
LOL RETAIL!!!
---
I picked up alchemy early and I'd agree so far I haven't made that much. I did try to make Swiftness potions after getting the recipe, but they are selling very cheap (5s/per) right now. And then I got free action potions which do take fishing in order to gather the materials if I'm going to do it myself, but these are still 20s/per right now on my server.
---
The one I've just got is Frost Oil at 200 alchemy (I bought the recipe and Khadgar's/Wintersbite from AH because I'm too low level for Alterac Mountains), and sold my first for 1g70s. This is probably a lot more viable for making money but we'll see how the value fluctuates.
---
I‚Äôd everyone transfers, then it‚Äôs not low pop :)

Bring a party, this quest as hard as hell if you‚Äôre the Same level

Not a priest question (even though I am a priest), but every time I have to login it gives me a server list. I have to change region tabs at the bottom and select my server.   
---
Retail automatically takes me to my server. Can I set it to automate this?   
---
I‚Äôm playing on one server but also have our names reserved on a second server (both on the same region tab), so I‚Äôm not sure if that influences it.
---
It takes more time to level lockpicking than it does to level rng/blacksmith to the required levels to open chests.
---
??? People have done the bragging this shit on twitter and other places ALL the fucking time. DDOSers can be hackers, but rarely are, you don't need to be particularly smart or skilled to rent a botnet. You do need to know basics such as how to do so anonymously but that's hardly proof you won't do any mistakes. Hackers get caught all the time. Actual hackers that know their shit far more than your average ddosers.

TSM is bad in classic, Auctionator is the way to go. I actually use both but TSM is just for stats.
---
If you‚Äôre a dwarf. Go to the room your class trainer is in IF. Go up stairs and the lady should have a blue question mark. Talk to her to get the book and the book will start the quest for you when you click it.

You can go ret but still heal dungeons and tank easily if you save healing/tanking gear.

Uh oh...

You are a fucking disgusting DDoser sympathizer, you honestly deserve to be banned from WoW for life and forced into male prostitution to make a living

---
It's not a rush... Enjoy the journey as you level. 12 years ago it took me 4 months to hit 60. Those who are already max level are playing a lot. And I mean a LOT. Just go at your own pace my friend.
---
10-man cleaves, that's why.
---
I'm not sure what I want to play at 60 yet, but I've been leveling as Holy but using a 2H while questing solo. I can heal most groups with ease and also find I'm often the top DPS with consecration spam.
---
Nope. Server mergers have never happened and will never happen, in classic, retail or otherwise.
---

All of it

I was dead when I logged in, rez'd out of crypts wasn't bad apart from durability damage.

Deviate Delight
---
The group didn't spend ten fucking hours leveling lockpicking.
---
We need to take a hard stance on bad crops.
---
Unless my math is wrong it's been about 11 days since classic launched. If we are using your 6 days of played to hit 60 that means more than half of their time spent living since then has been leveling in wow.
---
They did pull strings. Large corporations have the pull to make that happen. If you personally are the victim of a DDoS attack, then the FBI won't chase down the criminal and the Assistant U.S. Attorney won't prosecute the case. (Unless you're a billionaire. Then you might get that treatment).
---
I throw them a flare when they buff me! Kind of like fireworks!
---
I haven't explored Auctionator too much yet, but does it have a way to scan for any listing set for lower than the vendor price? That's basically all I use TSM for right, and Auctionator for everything else.
---
I wish my brothers fucking played. None of my irl friends play... I joined a Chad ass guild though and now I RP craft items in Orgrimmar with randos. Having the time of my life tho
---
Hey! Sorry about my first comment I took you as saying that This ddos attack was some sort of political stance when you said "feel the need to do this" with the "says something about the game" in a massive negative in which it was good to be ddosed and not in the way of that the game is a success. I'm the one who was dropped apparently.
---
I have a guildy that has been doing "free" carries through Stockades, BFD, SFK, etc. in return for all of the greens and stuff that drop. Apparently he's making a lot of easy money that way, and helping us catch up in return. Might be an option for you.
---
Hes playing everquest. . .
---
Usually I‚Äôll cast a heal and a renew right after, front loads the healing and then I won‚Äôt have to cast for a while longer letting that 5 second rule come back sooner. Even though renew is less mana efficient by the amount healed, the fact that it‚Äôs an instant cast helps with the whole mana regen thing makes it worth while. MB timing just takes some getting used to, but I definitely prefer using it only when I know I‚Äôll need the mana regen for sure.
---
The second snap will get rid of the DDoS‚Äôers.
---
This happened to me and another dude for that Defias Chest drop on VC. I wonüòå

Love the  art style, you come off as elitist in your comics though.

Thanks for the heads up. Just found a weak aura code online for energy bars+ energy regen. I‚Äôll have to check it out when I get on tonight.

Nearly all retail servers are merged together into groups, the same will happen in Classic
---
10 million people protesting in DC could very well change things. That‚Äôs a **lot** of people.

Protesting does matter. Just because every protest doesn‚Äôt cause massive legal changes doesn‚Äôt mean it didn‚Äôt matter.

im sure he got plenty of attention by his twitter handle being posted ~5 times every single thread about it.

That's the thing, they'll put excessive money into pinning this guy as bad as possible specifically to send a message for others not to do it.

How did you get DynamicCam to work?
---
Beautiful. You should have him chronicle the history of Classic through these works of art.
---
But you are missing the point that I just wanted to make a fun relevant video but I know how it goes, you are a loser that isn't creative at all so you post things like this on other people's stuff.
---
They're all professional opinionators. Pick and choose who you want to follow.
---
Learn something, dumbass.
---
I agree. Could keep my hit list on there.
---
For torture programs you aren't getting rid of them, no protest is strong enough. Not sure what message you wanted to see in my post but I wasn't saying protests are useless in general, but they are useless when it comes to things like this that are easily concealed and extremely lucrative.
---
I guess all you can do is choose to not post in threads about him.

What we're not told is that there is only 2 people in the guild

Specific examples please.
---
Not an AOE strat, but the Centaurs outside Maradon have near zero competition, have great drops of greys for cash, lots of chest spawns, and easy to kill.
---
Worst part about getting a full set, you never want to get rid of it. I had the entire blackened defias set on my rogue back when I first started playing. I don‚Äôt remember when I replaced a single piece, but it was embarrassingly late. Just as an example - I didn‚Äôt replace Cruel Barb until well into 30‚Äôs because I couldn‚Äôt find a weapon with better stats and didn‚Äôt know that dps on a weapon DOES matter (unlike armor on other gear).

This is the natural progression OP. I started off neutral and just /waved to passing lowbie hordelings until I went to shimmering flats and got hunted down by a 5 man goon squad over and over again. Was cathartic to kill a couple dozen horde on my way to desolace for the first time. If it's red it's dead, OP. It's war, afterall.

What server? Nothing fun like this happens on mine :(
---
Classic is very difficult to play solo. I mean, you can do it, but the game definitely encourages you to group up with others. BfA, on the other hand, can be played without every talking to a single soul in-game.
---
You mean queue times? Lmao
---
Lol, it did catch me by surprise, I'm sure he/she enjoyed that far more than ganking me lol. The WoW classic version of pressing all the buttons on the elevator.
---
do not put growl on auto cast at all
---
It goes up gradually and takes a while. 8 hours offline in an inn is like 5 bars of rested XP
---

Man - this subreddit.  Guy who says you have do be depressed and jobless to play the game a lot is a hero.  Guy who gives an example of someone who isn‚Äôt depressed or jobless is a fucking psycho.  I don‚Äôt think six figures is a lot for my area - was simply saying I‚Äôm not jobless or depressed
---
Bloodsail

You‚Äôll make friends/people to help you whilst leveling. I started playing in BC so I never played Vanilla. But, so far I‚Äôm loving Classic.

Enchant your gear over and over.  I don't get how this isn't super obvious.  Open your enchanting book.  Anything that is green yellow or orange cast that multiple times.

Last question I swear.

I'm trying to do a stance dance macro for demo shout and thunder clap. The issue I'm having is when swapping back into battle stance from def/ber, the macro will first cast demo shout instead of thunder clap, so I don't have enough rage to clap instantly in battle stance. I just modified the hamstring/disarm macro for this.
---
Here's the macro for reference:
---
&gt;  #showtooltip [mod:shift][nomod,stance:1]Thunder Clap;Demoralizing Shout
---
&gt;  /use [mod:shift]Battle Stance;[mod:ctrl]Berserker Stance;[mod:alt]Defensive Stance
---
&gt;  /use [stance:1]Thunder Clap;Demoralizing Shout
---
How do I prevent auto-casting demo shout when swapping back into battle stance for thunder clap?
---
plenty of people are in exactly your position and enjoying it. if you can afford to drop $15 on something you *might* not enjoy, i say definitely go for it.
---
Can I have some money back... I mean really...
---
I‚Äôm reliving classic vicariously through this sub.
---
Hey u/Necrosive I was using this macro with great success up until level 20 when I took dual wielding.  Now when I try to use the macro, it will not equip the 1h weapon.  Everything functions as before 20 other than it does not equip the 1hander, so you will just have a shield and no weapon equipped.  I am guessing that there is something that needs to be added to the script in order to tell the macro to put the 1hand weapon in main hand?
---
Any help is appreciated!  I was really relying on this macro in every fight.  The thing that put me off to Warrior was knowing that stance dancing was going to a bit of a pain but your macro was making it much more simple.  Thank you.
---
I sent you a friend request!
---
Most tanks I've seen do this already by fucking tanking in battle or berserker stance.
---
Seems we're back in 2005 with people taking literally shots of their screen as well.

---
you'll only ever get a max of 50 results. download census+ and look how that addon loops
---
Any recommendations where to start? I've been doing any quest that pops up in org since level 30.
---
So does that mean the party also shares herbs and mining nodes and leather from beasts?  Or do those go to the people who spent the time leveling the skill?
---
Is it though?
---
It doesn't anymore. A vast majority of the playerbase is on Chinese servers, and even including them, weakauras dev leaked the sub count numbers some months ago due to an API vulnerability Blizzard forgot to patch that pinned the sub count around 1.7 mil. So "millions" isn't actually even true anymore, and I'd you only count people in your region (US or EU) it definutely, absolutely isn't even close to even a single million.
---
So glad to have nova and blink when I just want to cross a map.
---
I never knew this, thank you for sharing :)
---
Druids using a lot of Mana? Hell nope, most of the time I don't need more to heal then Rejuvenate or sometimes a Healing Touch and the only times I'm really getting low on Mana is if the whole party gets damaged and I can't feasibly use Tranquility or really long Bossfights.
---
QQ more, bitch :)
---
Aside from the fact that‚Äôs not classic, god damn you need that much Red Bull? I just got off a 24 hour shift and had less than that.
---
Gross lmfao

There‚Äôs generalizations on both sides.  I‚Äôm sure some racists are leaving because they don‚Äôt want to encounter br or Hispanics, but undermining the communication barrier as a factor for wanting to transfer is dumb.

Thank you so much!

Yeah I was playing Whitemane all day today at 36-40. It's pretty fucking imbalanced. 'Demoralizing' is also the word I've had in mind. The future of this server seems destined to become even more slanted. 
---
Someone suggested that I ask for a party invite from someone on a different layer. That has been helping somewhat, as it seems that the people who *aren't* hopping away from these layers are just subjected to the compounded issue of most everybody else having bailed.
---
Hmm, I'm not exactly sure, Did you swap the two hander our for the dual wield? if so, re-write the first line that equips the 2h and change it like its written for the 1h/shield, but add 2 of the 1h parses. Im not home right now so i cant log on and actually test this myself, but should work. Unfortunately off the top of my head i can't remember the exact parses to write for the double 1h

Rolling twice in case of a tie is much more efficient than carrying decimals every time a roll is done. Also carrying decimals is not a tie breaker since ties can still occur.

As a mage, would the seer orb be best or is there another i should prioritize?
---
Yeah I do - you on heartseeker??
---
lol, I've been tanking as a ret pure without any special gear. Not because I want to, but because I'm asked to lmao.
---
I usually do well enough to get us through without any issue, so special gear isn't really necessary... maybe just a competent group and a good healer and we do fine.
---
Who tf is ManKRIK?
---
Yes it was on Deviate Delight lol
---
Differences I noticed that made it into classic:
---
Holding shift on a piece of gear will show what you have currently equipped for comparison
---
You can set cooldown numbers on the action buttons from the menu
---
For connecting flight paths, you can end your flight earlier by pressing a ‚Äústop at next FP‚Äù button like in retail
---
You can mail multiple items just like in retail
---
As much as I‚Äôm a #nochanges guy, these are things that don‚Äôt affect the core gameplay and I would have modded with an addon anyway (except the ending the flight early button), so I actually welcome these.
---
Such a good idea, I didn't even think about that haha
---
How much of your ui do you have to change for this to work? Wondering how it would work on both on phone and on desktop when I‚Äôm not at work. Don‚Äôt really want to have to change things around all the time.
---
Hacking- the gaining of unauthorized access to data in a system or computer.
---
It‚Äôs the really low level stuff (like 1-20 range) that pays out lots of small-increment Rep with factions. 
---
In reality, you‚Äôre looking at Runecloth farming unless you‚Äôre willing to go back and slog thru the low level quests (which have their own issues)
---
That‚Äôs the point.
---
People need to stop glamorizing twitch.

For me my weekend starts tomorrow, but I feel y'alls pain. Best part is these are likely stupid script kiddies and will be traced and face legal repercussions

Quoting one of the most well-known movies in all of human history?
---
No worries there! I just need quest helper and a dps tracker. Thanks for the info!
---
This memorial is located in Hillsbrad Foothills at 67, 84. I stumbled across this while questing and had never heard about it.
---
TBC certainly had a very strong community style to it. No cross server interaction (except for PvP, not sure when that started), no lfg like it is currently, and certainly no lfr.
---
TBC was more of an add on of content and a ‚Äúfresh start‚Äù for those that joined vanilla too late to be overly relevant.
---
That being said I would be perfectly okay with either of those directions. I love both. However, I would like to see a classic+ style where content is added that we‚Äôve never seen before.
---
The crossroads definitely seemed way more crowded, but that's just anecdotal.
---
I think that u must have atleast friendly reputation (green) for guards attack
---
Hey did PVP mounts exist in classic (I'll assume no)
---
There is a lot to be said about questing and leveling efficiently. Minimizing downtime, using a bank alt, skipping out on leveling main professions; these are a few things that the level 60 players are doing.
---
No worries me too
---
I hope ur alliance.
---
Exactly how was it supported by the wow community?  I'll wait for your sources.
---
I always invite warriors. They stand there staring at me as I kill all the quest mobs in one go. They look so sad that I can't help but feel sorry for them.
---
Fuck other classes though. They just pull mobs through my aoe and get me killed as soon as they see me...
---
Why when?
---
You‚Äôll get bad results.  
---
Either use Discord of server you‚Äôre on or just use Trade City/World chat. Alternatively use addon
---
You'd be surprised. 
---
I host game servers for an old Call of Duty game and we frequently get DDoS'd, constantly mitigation emails from our host. It's actually crazy there are people that care enough to do this. 
---
Makes more sense to me people targeting a MMO like WoW, but for us and our small game servers it literally makes zero sense and in a way is kind of sad.
---
I see blue on there, but unsure if that means anything. It looks hyper-saturated to me.

Unfortunately im not home so i can't really mess around with it to see what the issue is, but if you're swapping out the 2hander for the dual wield, you should be able to delete the parse from the macro " /equip \[equipped:shields\]  " and the two hander name and change it to /equip slot 16 "weapon name" /equip slot 17 "weapon name"

Someone just put 15 bucks on there account and is about to have a great time. But here you are asking a bunch of strangers?
---
Me too! Kara was the absolute best for me. It truly felt like a real raid but with a much more intimate group. And those first few months, before The enemies were nerfed, was one of the must frustrating/rewarding experiences in my gaming life.
---
As a priest, if you run by me, you're getting some fortitude.
---
Not overly impressive but well done
---
I tried it. Game did open but when I put my data it doesn't connect. I'm from LA. they probably shafted our servers in favor of US.
---
I don't want class balance. When I play classic, I know what classes are good at different things, I get to factor that in my decision of what to play. Currently I'm taking dungeons as a paladin and the fact that I'm humorously slightly gimped is part of the fun of the class. But I also have various advantages as well (easy to find groups, easy to escape in pvp) And I knew what I was getting into when I started, I was able to make a tradeoff and play what I like. I don't want to see it balanced
---
great tip.
---
Skinning a bear aggros all bears, I guess it's the same with raptors

I had to disable a few events (event crafting stuff), as well as some cast related timing (set default 0 to 1 seconds now).

---
Paladins are most useful in all facets of the game when they are playing heals. They *can* do Ret in pve or PvP, they *can* do prot in pve, but they aren't very good and it's not a path is recommend anyone try to invest a lot of time in to.
---
You'll also see zzz instead of your level on your portrait
---
As long as the mobs are melee, you can basically handle all the way up to your own level. It's just constant nova-&gt;move-&gt;blizzard. Rinse and repeat until they are dead.
---
Mess around with your colorblind settings in the retail client. It's pretty reminiscent of that.
---
This thread is exactly what they want to see... why?
---
There‚Äôs a talent in the Subtlety tree called Improved Sap. Fully talented, you have a 90% chance to stay in stealth.
---
Over their nameplates or target frame? Weakaura id a good one that caan do that with a setup/import string. There are more aswell you just habe to google a little.
---
If thats true, its terrifying; I guess the peek was what, 11mil or something a few years back (5 years or so?), so that'd be like an 80% reduction or something. Depending on region and such.
---
Even if 2M subs at approx $15USD ea (China is less IIRC) then still $30M/month is not bad, but not the numbers someone like Blizz would like I'm sure.
---
Proving my point that in this case mobile with a picture is easier

Had a wholesome interaction today.  I ran into a horde hunter (I'm ally) who had a gorilla pet, same as me.  Not many people roll with gorillas so i ran up and bowed, cheering at his pet.
---
He cheered and bowed back, and we stood in peace for a few moments before going our separate ways
---
That has a name it is called "The ol reddit witch hunt". But for real hope they figure out who is actually doing this stupid shit.

Waaahhhhh I died in pvp wahhhhhhh. Nerf damage waahhhhhh.

Thanks!
---
Don‚Äôt really need special gear to tank, just a sword and shield.
---
Leveling professions takes much less time than lockpicking, that's why so many rogues don't level it. A rogue is invited to dps, not offer lockpicking services. 
---
A gem drop from a node is frequently more valuable that whatever drops from the chest so there's no logic to this reasoning aside from the fact that people look at chests and lose their minds.
---
lolno
---
Engineers are OT exempt bc they make hundreds of thousands per year.
---
It aggregates them seeing one of their fallen brothers' bodies be desecrated as such
---
have sympathy for us old school oceanic players who not only had to connect to US servers but US servers on dial up.... 300+ ms every day, raids would result in D/C and interrupts where almost impossible
---
I agree. Blizzard, let my guild be named after poop again.
---
I wish i could roll from biggles to a pve server
---
Ten pounds of nope crammed into a five pound bag.
---
Do you make over $200k per year?
---
If we smell an american its like a shark smelling blood.
---
Doing bigger numbers= fun.
---
Not likely. While leveling, your max rank spells are more mana-efficient. Cat a big heal followed by renew, then wait until it's necessary to do so again. You will regen a lot of the mana used before its necessary to heal again.
---
yeah a lot of questionable choices it sounds like .. the old classic Blizz love of RNG, too; grind and RNG.. the antithesis of fun :/ (I'm thinking Hearthstone.. high cost to stay in current meta, and a tonne of RNG to reduce skill...)

---
Dunno if you weren't paying attention or what, but Faerlina was down for over 6 hours. They accomplished what they wanted to.
---
Thats a good way to put it; maybe I'll refamiliarize myself with retail a little.. I mean, as long as I'm paying monthly sub just for classic, retail is a freebie; and if the rumour is true that level 60 in classic gets you BFA, thats a nice perk at the end.
---
So, could check out BFA for a few mins here or there, if the queues are bad :P (hmm, is that their plan, leave the queues bad so people will BFA...)

Well okay then Mr. Gloomy.

I like that item frame. Could someone please tell me that addon name? &lt;3

Get riposte and blade fury and adrenaline rush asap in combat tree. The only important thing for gear is having a slow speed sword/mace in the main hand so your sinister strike and other instant attacks have a high damage.
---
Use a slow main hand weapon and a fast off hand. 
---
Your rotation should be sinister strike spam into eviscerate. 
---
Do the poison quest at level 20 and use double instant poison.
---
I don't mind difficult. My biggest gripe with the game has been the lack of consequences for dying.
---
The macro is working, I want it to cancel the form if I use the modifier 'shift' or alt + key' and instantly cast the spells by pressing it once.
---
Problem is, the cancel aura is obligatory for instant spell (or you have to press a key to cancel the aura then another to cast the spell) but it cancels the aura even when the enemy is not in range of the spell, thus not casting the spell and wasting the form.
---
It's not a big deal, just wanted to see if someone had a workaround.
---
Holy shit a druid was my first ever WoW character, and arcane missiles is one of my favorite spells ever, and i never knew this. Mind blown.
---
You say confirmed but don‚Äôt post the source.
---
"Trying to educate you people" but you cant even use context clues to deduce what someone is talking about, hence your 1 word reply "what". Look at my original comment where I said "probably."
---
Furthermore, if you want to argue about the definition of the word phishing, we can also talk about how hackers will set up domains all the time just to get people to connect to those domains so they can grab information. The act of clicking on the link is a phish, it doesn't have to be a Facebook profile.
---
Also you're talking to someone who studied CS in school and currently works in the industry. I didnt even need to look at the link to know what OP was worried about. You did.

So piss of pedant, you're not educating anyone by regurgitating whatever talking points you think impress us. Nothing about my original response has changed

Dude, this happens to me all the time. This is fucking annoying.

which one?
---
You're going to be in for a sad surprise when you realize half rogues don't level lockpicking because it takes too much time, especially while leveling. Better check before inviting them. 
---
Nice touch with the condescension at the end there. Real nice person to group with, I'm sure.
---
Haha if that was the case they would have stopped releasing new servers a while ago
---
idk most of them wait until I cast 1 spell.  I did have some genius priest start dotting mobs while I was still actively pulling them but I just left the group cuz he was the leader lol
---
I loved your pasta!

And a druid shouldnt have gcds

Less so gloomy but more that I lack empathy so I don't have a need/want for friends.
---
Oh my rogue is rolling on it for sure
---
What's broken about it?
---
A quick look at Joana's previous **world record** run shows it taking about 11 and a half hours to hit 20. Speed-levers have improved on that pace over the past 13 or so years, obviously, but that's still **way** faster than 99.9% of players. The idea that you expect OP to half that time just because they use a guide is laughably stupid.
---
He‚Äôs not a hacker; he‚Äôs a script kiddy. Found some fancy DoS tools and decided to buy a ticket to jail. Good riddance ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

---
I'm pretty new to rogues. This play style seems pretty fun. Could you recommend a build to follow while leveling up?
---
I'm on stalag. Cant speak for other servers or even my own 100% but honestly, there are very few priests.
---
I have seen so many shamans. Soooooo many. And more druids. Though some are feral. Most heal.
---
That stamp buff has become so nice. I dont get it often.
---
I've seen all the other classes plenty.
---
Mages are also always in demand. And tanks.

I‚Äôm convinced it is. Been dueling rogues for years and it‚Äôs the contributing factor to winning a duel or gank

I just like shamans. No contest.
---
hahaha woww. i love you
---
just start the groups and kick the monkeys.
---
Good one
---
If you moved servers it doesnt matter you changed classes.
---
As an aside. Druids get slow in the 20s especially if you're levelling as a heal spec instead of feral.
---
Priests will have the same issue if they dont run shadow.
---
While levelling you run what's optimal. And your gear switches your playstyle (more so as a druid).

Logged on after a morning of work, got dc'd twice, both times logging on to ghost mode. Saw news of DDoS and took the Harley I've been neglecting for a few hour ride. Wind therapy did the trick!

In what world will a warrior with 25 yard intercept stand up to a hunter with a 35yd range which becomes 41 yards when they talent hawk eye? Same thing for mages tbh, mages only have 30yd range so they're more likely to get intercepted while casting but then they just blink and /laugh. Warriors are wet noodles against kiters when they don't have help or a FAP.

It‚Äôs over now, enjoy your night :)
---
Then that would just make the servers that are at a perfect population have longer queues and instead of having a couple servers that they warned people to move off of earlier with multi-hour queues, most servers, including the ones that people that listened to Blizzard moved to, will have a couple hour queue
---
Amazing! Also the entrance music of the horde.... perfection.
---
I mean I personally don‚Äôt but it‚Äôs not illegal for your employer to ask you to do so here.
---
For me (and I'm not a kid) Its the fact I've never logged onto reddit.com. And ive only logged into my bacon reader once, and dont know my password, so to post a ss I would also need to reset my password and then reset it on my app. It's just a waste of time imo

Smolderweb? üòé
---
This guy lives in the future.
---
Then why do you want to play an MMO? If everyone is just gonna be an NPC to you anyway.. you might as well just play a single player game.
---
You're going to want all of those skills *eventually* so don't fret too much. Generally though, I'd recommend you only get the skills you use in your typical rotation (unless you're going to be tanking a lot). That probably means stuff like blood rage, battle shout, heroic strike, execute, etc. All of that utility stuff (and stuff like cleave/whirlwind) can probably wait until you've made some extra cash.
---
Except the 2nd one should of killed the warrior
---
Yeah agreed. Our parents are failing our children too much these days =(
---
People who post streamer crap should be banned.
---
The only part of my UI that I changed was the scale (made it as large as possible) and I moved the chat window and my threat meter addon just below my player frame. 
---
It isn‚Äôt really easy to fix when I return to my desktop. If you are only using addons that provide additional support (vendor price, questie, threat meter, auctionator) then you won‚Äôt have to worry about Major UI tweaks.
---
Ppl so salty here haha,destroy those low lvl trash casuals, rogues ftw
---
Ya do it

I set this day aside to play with my little brother while we were both in my home town for a wedding. We got in an hour together, playing in the same room, before the attacks started. :(
---
Yea buy time on wow account 1 and switch it to classic and play
---
That's a really nice picture! :)
---
Read more closely, genius. He sent gold from his main. It's not a lie.
---
Do you want a hug mate?
---
Thanks for the reply! Any idea which addons they were using??
---
Oh yeah I get that, probably explains why some of those warriors took so much damage.
---
Just get better plate gear damnit! Armour is a stat too &lt;3
---
Grats!
---
Yep, that's exactly what I said.  I believe chests should be rolled on by the group because I believe rogues shouldn't have any fun or enjoy benefits of their class.  Took the words right out of my mouth there.  I'll be enjoying the benefits of my class not healing or buffing you.  
---
See, I can hyperbole too.
---
Tsm works just fine for me.
---
Cringe
---
I tanked back in the day too, and that's unfortunately one of the things that got "changed". Things are much more fast paced and untraditional. Not sure I like it
---
Just two points in Master of Deception is enough to not be seen by mobs.  You don't at have to go all-in to get a benefit.
---
lol get shit on loser
---
Or using someone else's email address to set up your twitter account...
---
Not really. Consider that for several classes their pre-BiS and BiS gear are not all the same armor types. I believe there are leather pieces that are BiS for warriors for example.
---
Also consider that technically some classes are relatively safe in assuming they won‚Äôt be taking damage all that often. Hunters are a good example as their pet will be tanking for them while they‚Äôre leveling, so armor value has even less incentive. In dungeons, well, in an ideal world the tank will be the ome taking a beating, not the dps. The armor does help when shit happens, but the damage output is still way more valuable.
---
Itemization in classic is completely different from retail. You will see warriors rolling on leather and even cloth and that‚Äôs just to be expected because the nature of vanilla‚Äôs items.
---
Solid advice,you wont feel like ur slow then.

Because the only thing gnomes are good at is being part of meal.

&gt;It‚Äôs just sad that humans get enjoyment out of taking fun away from other people.

Is it tho?

Taking the enjoyment from other people in games is sometime's the exact purpose.

Take ganking as an example, just a random element in WoW.

Related to topic, considering how often these kind of stuff happens, most of the time it's done for fun or the thrill as well.

I'm on Skeram and I haven't experienced any of this lag or disconnecting that you're talking about...
---
You wanna be resto when you are at max?
---
I have so many different toons on different servers ü§£
---
Games still got bugs, ive encountered 3 seperate mobs stuck in terrain.
---
Why'd you have kids if you didn't want every second of your life to revolve around them.
---
Childfree here, the wife and I have nearly 2 days play time on our classic characters.
---
Pff, been level 60 for days at this point
---
Yes it is lame.
---
No vanilla was not like that.
---
No it's not because of "Server Stress"  As the pirate servers that cannot be named on this forum had a single server with over 10,000 people playing on it simultaneously,  with no lag.  
---
It's just blizzard being cheap and relying on microserver clusters as its far cheaper than a proper setup
---
This is how the claptrap DLC in borderlands started.
---
9:07 on 9/7
---
I enjoy playing games with/against real players. I have no interest in playing against AI.
---
The only difference is I have no need to find and play with a consistent players/groups. Certain mechanics require multiple players, sure, but playing with randoms is fine as I won't see them again after we're done. It's fine when everyone is a stranger
---
Just stop.  Heartbreaking is when you get dumped or your dog dies.  You don‚Äôt get to repurpose the meaning of the words because the servers were down for half a day.  I don‚Äôt care how limited your opportunities to play this game are, if this was ‚Äúsoul crushing‚Äù for you, toughen up.
---
I'm also a leatherworker like you, but cmon, they also chose the skinning profession. I have to side with sharing the leather with them.
---
What really fkn (and I mean FKN) grinds my gears is when some asshole camps every single dead beast and skins it as soon as it's available.
---
well i mean what server did you choose to play on, its called a realm. for instance im on whitemane.

---
I use the basic stuff like:
---
/use [@target,help,nodead]Healing Wave;[@target,harm,nodead]Lightning Bolt;Healing Wave
---
To cut down on keybinds for healer classes. You can also use "@cursor" on spells like Blizzard for quick ground targeting like some other MMOs have (GW2 off the top of my head).
---
You don't "need" macros but they can vastly change your control options or basically be a kind of spellcrafting.

Why specifically WoW1 account? Wouldn't I be losing any previous characters I've played if not buying game time on that account?
---
How does DDoS protection work?  I'm an engineer on the non-networking side and I am very interested to hear your expertise!
---
exactly, but i think "terror" is used too loosely. I'm not a linguist or a political scientist or anything so I'm just speaking as an individual, but it doesn't sit right in my head that a video game's server being ddos'd is an act of "terror," it just seems dramatic. Not that it's cool or anything of course, and not that I don't believe the person who did it should be punished, but I don't think it's terror as killing people or burning a building or shutting down a hospital.
---
Resto to level is going to be painful.  I‚Äôm leveling feral to respec at 60.
---
Don‚Äôt be an ass
---
God I hate twitchspeak.
---
Hi. First time here?
---
Welcome to the classic experience. You'll figure out that warriors are great tanks but feral druids can tank adequately too.
---
I play Alliance and am actually glad you killed him.
---
And he popped retal to further humiliate himself. In all honesty I would delete and make a new character with a new name. I would never be proud of what I would accomplish on this shameful character after this.
---
I remember when that one group DDoS'd WoW and a bunch of other platforms back in MoP. They got absolutely shit on. One dude was charged with over 50,000 counts of computer crimes and a couple other were jailed.
---
What's going in with what people are talking about
---
I'm sleepy af and all I really registered was somebody saying "flat earth"
---
I‚Äôm just adding these people to ignore and leaving. There are enough people but not enough tanks to go around. I give them three tries and then I‚Äôm out. They‚Äôll learn one way or another. Generally people add me now at the end of dungeons so when I login I have plenty of people around my level that wanna dungeon.
---
Somewhat related, does anyone know of any good healing raid frame addons similar to Grid (mostly for PvP-use)? All the ones I've tried have been broken.
---
Give it time. I am sure Classic will go in an entirely new direction with updating content that was never really touched and left abandoned. It will probably go in a similar direction that oldschool RuneScape did. Where there will be updates that still maintain the "Classic" feeling. Also, I hope Blizzard decides to go with gear progression rather than level progression. Level progression completely gimped old content making many zones abandoned.
---
That spots is fine or any spots in stv. Also the elementals in arathi are good for farming gold.
---
I use a custom xpadder

My fun is big numbers so no u

---
Really gotta just throw a *little* shade, eh?
---
Healbot works perfectly on Classic.
---
If you're going to solo might as well do it on a pserver. Less players(your main enemy in the game is other players taking your shit), no queues, and Blizzard doesn't get your money. Win-win-win.
---
Yikes. Nah not really. They aren't good in dungeons so I don't know why you'd say that. I'm talking just end game (naxx) pvp, whether that's dueling or wpvp. They'll need a lot more tricks to help them in wpvp (swiftness pots / nades) but still, if you think that a ret pally CANT beat almost every other class with equal gear / skill at that phase of the game, idk what more to tell ya
---
My 9 year old: "you know when you kill the boars it sounds like a baby crying." 
---
Me: "why would you tell me that!?"

Sooo... not classic
---
What swing timer add on is that?
---
PP UP
---
&gt;tfw everyone thinks it's retail but you see "Lightbringer"
---
Eh. I was getting super frustrated as well, trying to ‚Äútank‚Äù in a traditional manner.
---
Then I had a bit of an epiphany, I tanked dungeons until 40ish on my shaman in classic. Threw on a 2h and WW/Cleave have fixed all the issues.
---
I tell the healer I‚Äôm going to 2h tank for most of the run, and if they struggle to let me know but the DPS will have to turn it down initially if they need me to take less damage.
---
I‚Äôve been doing cath runs from 37 or so with just the WW axe except for mograine, out of 30 runs the healer has not been able to keep up maybe 6 or 7 times.
---
Gnomes are a lot of fun.  Go play one if it looks interesting.  Running around using /lol and /train as a gnome is a blast.   Also warlocks are my favorite class, but I went orc this time around.
---
My wife yells at me when she hears wolfs yelping when they die .....

They‚Äôre just ERPing with the black drake.
---
My interactions on Faerlina have been nothing but nice. Everyone is super friendly on the Alliance side. People stay with me to help me finish a quest and everything. As a mage, I have invited people to my party and helped them finish a quest if I was farming the mobs they needed. People have asked me for water/food and tried tipping but I give it for free. 
---
I think some servers are more toxic than others. Faerlina has been insanely wholesome, even from people in Asmongold's guilds.

Is this the area that was shown on the show Cheat! way back in the day? after you go through airfield
---
Mages have the advantage how? In open Wpvp, yes, but with nades / consumes, the ret pally is still going to be looking pretty good. Penance is big, same with hand of freedom.
---
How do rogues have the advantage? Plate, bubble, LoH, again, HoF. 
---
Hunters do, I'll give that, but in that phase (naxx) hunters fall off so much that one penance + HoJ combo should be enough to end it.
---
Shamans are tough.
---
Priests... yeah, SPriests and Warlocks are kind of kings of 1v1s

Yup I've tamed him and others have posted pics.
---
All things in moderation
---
Cap for leveling enchanting by disemchanting is 70. From then of you have to enchant things. 
---
It‚Äôs one of the most expensive craft skills to level. It will take you a very long time if you are only using materials you get from disenchanting. You‚Äôll likely end up buying a lot.
---
I think Skeram is worse right now. There were like 30 horde hanging out there about an hour ago. However has no chill.
---
It all makes sense now. I always complain about how useless Wisp form is, but in truth we have FIVE racial abilities, so it's ok!
---
That says more about your penal system than the fact that he downed some WoW servers for a couple of hours...
---
Do you know Ret's issues? Gear absolutely does solve it. They also have very good scaling into the late game with high AP / SP coefs. Rets are mana hungry. High-end gear has the INT that they really, really need without sacrificing their other stats.
---
Didn‚Äôt you *just* post this? 
---
Don‚Äôt spam, please.
---
Yeah nowhere near that, maybe 80-100g on average when people have deeper pockets.
---
Ok but his damage was so low the entire time that it's hard to even compare it to what other hunters do and how affected it is.
---
No, Classic is bad. Retail is so much worse it's off the scale.
---
What's the album name, Dead Beats?

Did I? I thought I was just giving everyone on the subreddit a chuckle.
---
A half HP/Mana warlock with no demon whooped him bad.
---
Always have Rockbiter when tanking dungeons. Use earth Shock mainly as it generates double threat, use down rank earth Shock to save Mana (rank one still interrupts) also use down rank lighting shield during the fight to keep aggro on multiple mobs while and conserve Mana.
---
Same but I landed on a hill side in Burning Steppes and didn't die.  Unfortunately my hearth was set to Astraanar
---
Oh dwarf of the wall, what is your wisdom?
---
The world hates you probably.
---
I had a rogue in my party distract a group outside SM, then ask who attacked them after they wiped our group.    
---
The warrior charged me after you distracted him!  They aren‚Äôt idiots who wonder why their character turned around.
---
As a hunter, if I see an enemy rogue moving toward me I‚Äôll mark him for my own safety. I won‚Äôt make any moves toward him at all‚Äîbut I WILL know where he is on my minimap if we‚Äôre going to be questing in the same area.
---
I‚Äôll fight this a little.
---
I‚Äôm at the enterprise level a lot, and they moved away from ‚Äúservers‚Äù being physical boxes a long time ago before they started merging servers into groups on live.
---
It is incredibly, and I mean incredibly more expensive to have 1 host with the capacity for 10000 people than it is to have 5 hosts with the capacity for 2000 each. Go look at the pricing difference to get 128 cores on 1 host vs 128 cores on 5 hosts. 
---
If you have a small base. You can go ahead and spec out the best host you can and really churn it, but the second you need to expand to 10001, you‚Äôre posed with a dilemma.
---
Do you keep your enterprise at parity and buy another host that will suit 10000 people for a 1% active capacity increase? Do you buy another host that can only hold 2000, and then you have different hosts in your environment with different firmware versions, making version control even harder, and bug fixes difficult.
---
Blizzard literally learned from their mistakes with vanilla, where they ran high spec bare metal hardware, and decided not to do the same thing a second time.
---
My only contention that would have been an improvement to this, would have been to allow the layers to be selectable at server select and add a cooldown on switching them. 
---
You‚Äôre on Herod-2? Great, names are shared all throughout Herod, you can chat across, and you can swap layers once an hour, make sure everyone plays on Herod-2.
---
Herod 2 fills up? Not a big deal for you to move to 3 or 4 with your playgroup, and an hour or two cooldown would be reasonable.
---
When they squash the layer, it‚Äôs transparent, and painless.
---
Otherwise, you wind up with painful server merges, or ghost town servers and hardware that is sitting there, spun up and eating up space in your data center and power.
---
It‚Äôs also a really bad sword since it‚Äôs mainhand and fast.
---
Why would using a slow staff be worse than using a slow axe or mace?
---
Everything scales well with gear buddy. Locks. Mages. Warriors. Rogues. Ele shamans. Hunters are the exception, but I'm pretty sure a decent BWL shaman will annihilate a Naxx geared ret.
---
Apologies for the inconvenience. the post was not showing in "my posts" and i couldn't access it, even after i waited an hour or so. The only solution i found in the help was to re-upload it. 
---
If there is an established procedure for this type of erros i would like to know it. :(
---
Honestly if I was peace questing and got fairy fired, I would take that as a sign of aggression
---
Just a general idea of what I should put it in the auction house for would be nice.
---
Been there. Third due Xmas day. Can't wait, gaming with a kiddo strapped to me makes the gaming guilt free and special. Love it lol

That's the sad truth about growing up I suppose. Luckily there is still fun to be had in the admittedly different atmosphere, but I would be lying if I said I wouldn't want to relive the original atmosphere.

There are some things money simply can't buy.

It takes several days to earn a level worth of blue bar in an inn anyway, so it can't catch you up. Only mitigate the problem somewhat.

The developer of MoveAnything is working on a 1.13 version for classic. He said it will be updated in a few days (that was a week ago). Hopefully this week, maybe?
---
Yea, I'm laughing with you - not because he'll rot in prison, because your country thinks the crime justifies the punishment.
---
Well done.

"But guys I'm an enchanter so I roll need on everyone to DE"

I‚Äôm working hard to ignore these issues and I‚Äôm letting you know you‚Äôre not alone.  I have bumped into a lot of people like you are describing but I‚Äôve met a precious few who get it.  Hang in there and look for a guild of old school vanilla players.  If not, hell  build one!  Then you set the rules.  Only keep the players that get it.  It will never be the same, that‚Äôs true - times and people have changed - but you never know, you might just stumble into something better!  Good luck and Happy Hunting!!
---
Forget ActiBlizz, they fucked with Amazon too. That's pretty dumb considering how much clout they have to throw about .
---
I agree the dungeon spam culture and overall dungeon speedclear mentality is definitely a new and annoying part of the game, but I've had enough great Classic moments outside of that to where I'm pretty happy with the game and it's community at the moment.
---
"lol so far as a feral cat, ive been outdpsing every dps in dungeon runs since WC. lvl 40 at the moment." Tf are you talking about bro. How does what i said not make sense? You are literally bragging about YOUR damage in dungeons.
---
Current MoveAnything won‚Äôt work in classic.
---
And all of that eclipsed ten fold by the lawyer fees that will be spent on top. Cyber crime is no joke. This isn't 2008 anymore where rinky dink jurisdictions are not equipped to deal with this kind of crime. Hope that dude isn't using anything that can be traced back to them!
---
I think you were listening to the wrong people. Staffs are great for shaman and a lot of the advice is using 1h and shield.
---
&gt;:(
---
+fire damage no question about it.
---
int is absolute garbage you can drink as much as you want
---
I can count the number of times someone has talked to me during a wq during legion and bfa on one hand. I had more interaction with other players during redridge questing than I have in multiple expa prior. Sure some groups want the right classes if they are trying to grind mobs in a dungeon for hours but as for the normal groups they could care less. They can't inspect your talents much less even your spec.
---
I'm planning on doing DM until I get the cookie wand. Is that a good idea?
---
Higher DPS is always higher DPS because armor is a % reduction, crits or not. As for skills it depends, most of them are based on attack power so they don't care about attack speed either. Aimed Shot is an exception, not the rule.
---
Chug :)
---
In that thime they increased the amount of layers on each realm and change the population indicator so that it is now relative to the max population possible rather than the most populated server.  Low pop is likely very close to a full server sans layering.
---
‚Äú/console reloadui‚Äù fixes most things
---
Say that when you go oom on a boss in 30 seconds
---
I got rid of it when I bought a different mouse. I had it on my old Steelseries mouse but haven't had it since buying a Logitech G Pro Wireless. I don't know why
---
People need to transfer. I‚Äôm playing on Heartseeker right now and it feels so DEAD. The queues don‚Äôt go down when no one moves off the server
---
It was on live for a very short amount of time back in the day. You‚Äôd have paladins 1-shotting green dragons and kazzak woth reck-bombs. 
---
It was fixed by 1.12, so not in classic.
---
When you can stop between mobs, sure it's not too bad. Sustained in a raid fight thought? Unlikely
---
Im going hybrid spec for leveling to avoid respec at 60 until required for raiding. Probably going to end up 17+/10+/21. On a pvp server so having silence and imp mana burn with enough healing talents to do dungeons easily at 60 is a priority.
---
I love when a standard ganking grows out of control. The gankee gets an ally to take revenge- the ganker gets help too- next thing you know there are roving war bands all over STV hunting each other.
---
TIL "The Godfather" was firstly a book, secondly a movie.
---
Maybe if you don't work on the flight line.
---
dude why is it every time someone is talking about leveling some jackass comes in and starts talking about raiding?  A BOSS FOR 30 SECONDS?  WHICH BOSS ARE YOU KILLING WHILE LEVELING THAT TAKES 30 SECONDS HOLY FUCK
---
People didn't want classic  to just play like it was still vanilla, they wanted vanilla systems and gameplay that are more engaging.
---
Classic =\= vanilla. I don't think it ever was supposed to be.
---
Sea World
---
what lol I‚Äôm a priest and I literally invite who the fuck ever whenever I get to a quest zone that‚Äôs friendly because dpsing as a healer sucks ass and it‚Äôs nice to be able to chat with people
---
Can I trade Blue weapons ir armour that I got in the Deadmines?
---
Nice twitter post.
---
 Uninstall the game. Get off Reddit. Just sit in silence in your basement till you waste away. Someone who's able to DDOS WoW would be better company than you.
---
The main problem with the dungeon finder is that it kills the community. After 3.3 you didn't to build a reputation as a solid player in order to find instance groups easily. If someone fucked off in your dungeon run you couldn't get on Trade and badmouth them. Trolls got groups just as easily as good players and Blizzard even gave them kick protection in randoms. 
---
That's my problem with retail. I'm all in favor of QoL changes. I want more quality in my game-life. I just don't consider "easier" to be "quality of life". When they increased the power of the specs over and over without making the mobs tougher they were essentially nerfing all of the content. 
---
You can just turn off chat and solo play all the way through the LFR versions of the latest raids. The difficulty that required players to work together just to level up and gear up is gone and with it the community that I loved when I was first trying to get into heroics at level 80 is gone.
---
I guess I'm out of the loop. The last time I leveled with everyone else was in Cata and spamming dungeons was decidedly **not** the meta, at least on the crappy server I was on. Instead people quested and bitched in g-chat about how brutal the dungeons were. But once people geared up and Blizz nerfed the dungeons then they started chaining randoms. Then came the complaints about the empty world and lack of gankable players that I mentioned. 
---
I was a Wrath baby but I might agree with you about TBC. Except that I think daily quests get a bad rap. The quests themselves are not the issue. It's the fact that content is gated behind them. We can keep the quests but also add alternative methods for reputation with the various factions. But flying... it made trying to fight people over an Auchindoun PvP tower pretty annoying. You didn't even have to dismount!
---
Weakauras can do that.
---
LF Tank SFK
---
Id say so
---
I saw an explanation like this once that I really love.
---
Imagine someone is mad at McDonalds. They get two bus loads of people to go at one time and have them order stuff that they don't serve like fish tacos or ramen noodles. The employees can't tell the real customers from the fake customers until they give their order. 
---
You could be a real customer but you have to wait on twenty or so other people first. The stores ability to take orders is maxed out and real customers can't even get in the door.
---
My kids loved the idea of people ordering the wrong stuff over and over.

You mean like how diablo has separate balls for each ?
---
Nooo :/
---
I'm not really sure how you make your point about weapon damage while also having read my post. My post is entirely talking about weapon damage and how a staff is actually used to kill things vs how a priest uses it, mostly as a stat stick. It's like comparing how a warrior uses a bow vs how a hunter uses it. 
---
Spirit significantly lowers your downtime because warriors take a lot of unavoidable damage and do not have any inherent healing abilities. You're not going to be straight up picking between Strength or Spirit a lot of the time anyway unless an item has Spirit and Stamina vs Spirit and Strength.
---
Faaaaar from happiest
---
you can't play with existing characters on wow classic anyway, everyone has to start new.
---
All of this specifics aside. You do understand that every queue is imaginary? Also those in real life? It‚Äôs a social reality that exists only because we all pretend it‚Äôs real.

Extradition treaties make a lot of sense with countries that hold the same laws and values. If citizens commit crimes in other countries with the same laws why not agree to hold them accountable where charged especially if you hold those same laws?
---
If you wanna drink every fight, sure, but it's more efficient just to stay in cat so you don't have to drink to regen mana.
---
Right? Heaven forbid the first 5% of their total play time sucks while the last 95% is amazing. I weep.
---
final fantasy.
---
and you don't NEED long term friends to play classic, you're perfectly able to group with random strangers who you'll never speak to again.
---
One of the things that made wow unique is that everyone is in the same world at the same time
---
Mindflay is bad till rank 3 lvl 36. Use smite till 36.
---
Devilsaur is good, herbing is good. Get an UBRS key. I havent been able to test pickpocket farms in BRD but maybe thats good.
---
No they legit made them weaker/easier
---
Thanks mate I‚Äôm aware of questie but I didn‚Äôt want something that marks my in game map all the time. I liked Vanillaguide as it was something like a little browser tab in game with instructions. Thanks though
---
int is the worst stat in the game while leveling.   if you're oom every pull drink every pull having mana longer and drinking longer isn't an improvement in efficiency except in saving water.

You on Stalagg? I‚Äôve seen soooo many priests (im one of them)

I feel you. I show them a cool totem as they run away...

Why you assume I imploded, you some kind of jerk?

Classic! :)

I think it's impressive that it even got 15% upvotes in this community.

Hi, /u/MickZagger

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d16v7c/m_dupree/).

Other than the fact that I was part of the 24/7 rotating infosec team dealing with this, you mean? Bravo.
---
someone's got to fly the satellites
---
yep!
---
Hear me out, go to an rp or rppvp server, people are much more willing to dick around on these servers.
---
thanks!
---
I think you are replying to the wrong person because what you are saying doesn't really make sense against what I have said. "His" profile when he was doxxed before he started hiding everything, explicitly showed him as having no connection to twitter, but sharing other social media. Generally, when people use social media like that they toss ALL of their usernames there because they want everyone to follow them everywhere. 
---
This hints at the fact he DOESN'T use twitter. Meaning the name of the kid being blamed is probably also just some random kid the "hacker" used because the "hacker" thinks they are slick stealing some random unsecure email. 
---
In reality you are arguing for my point, whether you realize it or not.
---
You can play in 2 person group in open world. Dungeons and raids will require full group untill you outlevel it seriously. You can find group for that runs in game easily
---
I go oom rly fast though
---
Is there equivalent low level sets for all classes? What‚Äôs the hunter equivalent?
---
Rolling twice would mean additional logic, carrying extra digits is super 'cheap' for computers.
---
Either way it is impossible to know how it works, I was just bored while servers are down.
---
Aaaand it‚Äôs gone.
---
I bet you could take a Similar picture in BFA
---
You haven't encountered Yei troll then. I INT *warriors.*

In Kromecrush they are very worth it.
---
You can enjoy content through and with others?
---
It's a human thing, try it.
---
When I use the census it won‚Äôt collect data below lvl 30 characters. Is there anyway to change it so it collects data from lvl 1-60
---
Ahh old classic elitism. Just because you played it before means no one else has?
---
That might depend heavily on the server. On my realm the LFG channel gets spammed hard for actual LFG/LFM use during the day. During the night it's a mix of LFG/LFM action and shitposting.
---
Read up on DDoS, how they work and how they are executed. read up on botnets, how they are established, what the purpose of botnets are and what the endgoal of a botnet owner is.
---
hint: ddos attacks on big companies arw advertisment for the botnet itself, to show of what the botnet is capable off.
---
I do hope we do OSRS style community voting.
---
Higher level mobs give different types of skin and in order to get those you have to be high enough level. So you have to start on low level mobs and work your way up.
---
What add on are you using for your party meters?? As a healer I need this
---
I've been wondering the same thing tonight while looking to get heavy hides!
---
god this hits too close to home.
---
 Is this on Yojamba?
---
I don‚Äôt know anything about the hardware or software side of it, it‚Äôs just a bit dissapointing. For instance if a guildie says, alliance are killing people at cross roads, I might show up there and see nothing. If I don‚Äôt join his group that is
---
I didnt log on today cuz i didnt have time ... The servers r down though? So i didnt miss anything???
---
How
---
Ahhh so that‚Äôs why I ended up going outside today
---
If it got you angry enough to comment on the size of their dick then I think it was worth it for them
---
Are you joking? He isn‚Äôt equating intelligence with obedience. He‚Äôs saying a smart person wouldn‚Äôt waste their time using their skills for something that doesn‚Äôt benefit them in any way or risk them jail time. I guess working is being obedient to the man. Very woke.

Yesterday I healed sm:l no problem in a 4 man group at 28. 
---
Today we wiped several times in an higher level 5 Man group with me beeing 30. The tank would always body pull the whole room besides me drinking  and was then blaming me that I didn't do my job when we were fighting against 10 elites at once which also use manaburn. As soon as I said it's not my fault and that he maybe should pull the mobs individualy he left the group and we had to forfeit. Still mad.
---
Looks like ElvUi to me

I hated guild perks

Must be a non-RP server

Spirit is the most efficient for single target questing, int for aoe grinding as the spells are quite intensive. You will have 0 longevity if you stack +spell damage without having high levels of spirit and intellect, resulting in more downtime and less overall dps.
---
You‚Äôre on one of the popular servers. 90% haven‚Äôt had a queue for a week.
---
I don't even know who Ghostcrawler is.
---
DHKs were added in patch 1.5 which is fine in phase 2, I don't see the issue there. We knew we weren't gonna get a patch by patch replica, even though a lot of us would have preferred that.
---
I‚Äôve been at work for 7 hours now, any update? We good to go, boys?
---
"You dun goof'd."
---
Fuck off you dry bowl of cereal
---
I remember trying to 'quiten' the dialtone in the computer room so my parents didn't know I was on it
---
so yeah, if you break the law you're stupid. I dont quite see how that's not literally equating intelligence with obedience but idk. I just like using the meaning words have...
---
Nothing like some nice cbt after a long day of questing
---
No one can tell you because no one knows the faction balance on any server nor when the players of each faction play or what level ranges each faction is mainly in.
---
At that point just use the pouch you get from lvl 20 class quest
---
Just use Ignore Pain, should be fine.
---
If you're trying to be in character and emulate a war, corpse camping shouldn't be a thing because you don't revive. Corpse camping is definitely a break in immersion, and it's literally one person taking pleasure in the misfortune of another. And if it were a thing in real life, it should be a war crime. Like bombing hospitals or killing unarmed women and children. Because someone 20 levels below you is just as much a slaughter as killing a child. So I don't buy the immersive war argument.
---
Yes, both for building threat and mitigating damage.
---
Lol this idiot again
---
yet...
---
Staffs are underrated in general. Warriors are using staffs as well
---
I did it solely for the 18 agi pants. Never again that place drains your soul.
---
This is fucking great
---
I wonder if there's actually been cases back in the day where certain electronics fucked with the modem and actually caused lag when you used them, besides the home phone of course. Like someones using the toaster and you can tell when it pops up because you lag in game
---
Talents?
---
Damn, that‚Äôs good.
---
Im curious on the server but I dont want others to get discouraged. Would you mind pming it? Just wondering if its the one im on.
---
How did he do it so fast? Mostly quests? Mostly grind? I never know what areas to go to and at what level, or what quests to do or to skip.
---
The cycle will never end, lowbie gets ganked by higher levels/others, gets frustrated, swears to do the same as he gets higher level, rinse &amp; reprat
---
Someone's played ff7 :D
---
Been grouping for a bit, kinda hard to find a retard dps.

Even a tard dps is still dpsing, you know?

PVP happened on a PVP server, working as intended...
---
I want your inventory slots plz.
---
From what i have heard, yes, succubus is the best drain tank companion
---
Dwarf rogue says hi
---
Alliance is a bunch of savages
---
I'm not asking IF my server is unbalanced. I have eyes, I know it is. I'm asking if there's any point to stay on a server that's massively against my faction.
---
I honestly think your account is just a big bait and we all took it.
---
Could be worse. You could be a Pally 20 points deep in prot.
---
Nobody in any dungeon has said a single thing to me about this. But I have had quite a few groups where everyone at the end was chatting about great group and smooth run and wanting to do another because it went so well and was total cake. Go figure.
---
Anyway I don't play a game to cater to the whims of autistic twelve year olds. You just keep doing you and if someone loses their shit over it send them straight to /ignore. In my experience almost nobody actually cares as long as they get their loot and get out alive.

People use insults when logic fails them.

Strange though. I‚Äôve been reporting players with really really bad names all week on our Role Playing server. But ever sense the ddos today, I‚Äôve tried to report two players. I get insta kicked each time I submit the report. I wonder if that is in some way related to Blizzards fix? Like, certain requests to communicate to the server gets severed.
---
It's over now, servers are working
---

The real question is if you specced into improved voidwalker? Cause I believe it will be significantally stronger.

Why wouldn't you have growl on autocast outside of dungeons and raids?
---
No. I just call idiots idiots lol.

Great work, thank you for the update!

So its not still going on? ;)

Fucking love it, fear, dot, laugh

Me hunter... Why cast lot spell when auto shot do trick?
---
Sounds like you suck
---
My realm is having a big issue with this according to our census. We lost about 7% of our Alliance players to the free realm transfer to Horde's 2%, furthering the already pretty large gap between the factions. The reality is though that moving likely won't help, as when the new server builds up it will only become imbalanced with time - or the server will fail to get off the ground and die. 
---
It's a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy honestly. Alliance players get overly concerned about the disparity between factions, which makes people less likely to roll there, which only furthers the gap even more. People need to stop panicking.
---
Let me guess... warrior?
---
What kinda civilian jobs?
---
Lol I missed these posts. Used to see them all the time on the old forums.
---
i had the same happen, spirit rez and free FP to Thorium Point =)
---
Start over on a Normal server.pvp is not enabled by default there.
---
Subjected? I'm not forced to do it, but I get that mother fucking bread son. 20 hours a week at 47 an hour on top of my base pay and full benefits. Go cry to someone else commie.
---
[MFW](https://youtu.be/9yw5fBg64Z0)
---
The attacks are illegal by law and there is precedent of this happening in the past with the offenders going to jail. Same thing will happen here.
---
Pretty much identical situation with me. About a dozen friends, and some completely new have subbed just for Classic.
---
It's better to go full elemental and heal as that. Keeps you effective at leveling but you can also use that INT and spirit gear to heal dungeons.
---
/eyeroll
---
The serious question here is how is the weight distribution on that zeppelin remotely safe?
---
Jesus Christ I‚Äôm so old
---
I've also been at work for 7 hours. Interestingly similar hours.
---
1. Group up
---
2. Ask high levels to help via Local Defense or Guild
---
3. Level in a different zone (Ashenvale is very close to Orgrimmar)
---
4. Play on a PvE server
---
Depends on the weapons. I switch around after what I got, right now I got some brand new 1 handers and DW is far faster, when I get a good 2h, I'll switch again.
---
I am only level 3. Is all hope lost?
---
you‚Äôre supposed to go outside and shower during the queue. there‚Äôs no acceptable case to do either of those while you could be actually playing.
---
It's still viable, just very far from optimal..
---
if you insist on continuing to play on a pvp server, all you can do is keep trying.
---
Soon the novelty of ganking people for "no" reward will wear out and as the player-base thins it will be the "Spiderman pointing at Spiderman" meme for all these horde players looking for pvp on all these 70-30 in their favor servers.
---
I'm alliance and this is still epic, god speed brothers! Hopefully Ill see you on the field of battle.
---
Grats man. That really sucks.
---
I only leveled 1 horde character in all my years of pservers, and doing it again on Classic, holy fug there's so many quests. Seriously, from level 15 to level 45, I never had less than 10 quests in my log at any time. And this is with skipping a lot of quests solely due to having so many in my log already.
---
I'm just getting to level 48 now and finally dipping below 10 quests....only because I dropped all of the Hinterlands quests to make room for the Searing Gorge ones.
---
You sound upset.
---
**F**
---
Masochism
---
Paid character transfer isn't available and if they don't change their mind it won't be available for months. If you don't like your server best is to reroll
---
Look at the front page. The posts there should answer your question.
---
Judging on your levels and composition you probably shouldn't have been wiping. There's adequate cc available, if he didn't want to mark or go slow that's on him. The way I see it, if I'm not asked to cc cowabunga it is. (If we accidentally pull mobs I will though.)  But it serves him right.
---
Replace Devilsaur in MC? You're exposing yourself lol.
---
I think the server would just crash at that point
---
Might be affected by the DDOS attacks.
---
Based and boomer pilled
---
there's a handful of level 20-30 zones that are all pvp enabled but you can move between them if one zone is particularly bad
---
ashenvale tends to be more horde populated cause of how close it is to orgrimmar and the barrens
---
"Arise, my champion."
---
"Oh, it's rising."
---
Projection isn't healthy
---
I doubt they'll take action against you for something like that, and even if they do, it'll likely only be a temporary chat restriction. Don't sweat it.
---
Bonus points if you're a class that can redirect the mob such as sending a Hunter pet to take aggro or Warlock fear.
---
I'm 18... the pain of having a life and not squeezing every last drop of efficiency out of my game time
---
Yeah I was assuming that as well. But I‚Äôve seen reports of the same issues from a few days ago and years ago. I just can‚Äôt pinpoint why only Tanaris is affected by this bug. All other fishing zones work.
---
But I can pvp on a pve server I just can‚Äôt openly do World pvp, unless I either flag myself green or attack an enemy faction city. Regardless of that a rogues toolkit is amazing in raiding as well.
---
This is going into Prezleek levels of unfunny.
---
That's a clothies repair bill at like 50+ aswell.
---
the wetlands are 20-30 and are heavily alliance weighted, i'm assuming you're a nightelf so you can go back to auberdine and take a boat there that goes to there
---
Right there with you dude. Came out swinging got to 33 then had to take a work trip overseas. Itching to play right now but I purposefully left my laptop at home so I‚Äôd enjoy the real world. Moderation!

Back in the day I ran a level 12 Rogue to Gadgetzan just to sap people in town. The guards didn't aggro from sap. But they did aggro the people who killed me.

They're talking about the button Chromie has in the Classic trailer that aired a few years ago.

He is a warrior tho. Is there anything that warrior kills reliably in 1v1?
---
Personally I spam both my shouts pretty much on cd when I have the rage. 
---
I was trying to ‚Äúproperly‚Äù tank tonight bc I got bored of shout spamming and the mages weren‚Äôt happy. Kept commenting about it when they were frostbolting before the mobs made it to me (ranged pull) 
---
Idk man
---
no, fuck you. everyone else was in the same situation and we bit the bullet. its actually a huge "fuck you" to everyone that either waited in the queue or didnt get to play at all if you and your friends get to take the easy way out and then transfer back anyway. 
---
blizzard said several times (and if you played in vanilla you knew this as well) that fewer servers meant healthier populations and you just "didnt have time to wait". 
---
you dont deserve special treatment, fuck you
---
Perfect Jurassic Park haha
---
Hate us cause you ain‚Äôt us

Yes, any major city stormwind, ironforge, darnassus, or any inn in any town. In a major city you don't have to be at an inn
---
Priests can use wands without training.
---
You would acquire a wand fastest by going to the auction house, as another user mentioned, the greater wand is good for lvl 13.
---
To use the wand, you would need to equip the ‚ÄúShoot‚Äù ability from your skill book. You shoot enemies with your wand.
---
Buttocks hat üß¢

I wonder if I could make a weakaura to /y automatically after a stranger buffs me.

Another option is to read the quest descriptions and trying to figure it out yourself :)

I really hope he browses this sub
---
I work about 9 hours during the week. I'm currently 34. While I used to be all into making sure I was in the "lead group" in fresh mmo starts overtime you start realize it matters very little. All the friends I had who leveled slow when I went fast, still got to where I was in the end. While I want to get to 60 as fast as I can, I try to keep it in the back of my mind that the people all ahead of me is really just a short term issue. Long term it wont matter at all.
---
Is it because you are fishing in the desert?
---
Hydrocane staff from gnomeragon allows infinite underwater breathing. Good to keep in inventory at all times!
---
No agro wipe is part of it.
---
You will if they are in other layers yes, obviously.
---
So are all you live to see such times
---
If they‚Äôre frostbolting then they‚Äôre single targeting. Keybind a macro that marks your target with a skull, you will be able to hold threat single target. Demo shout is 1/3 of the threat generation of a sunder, so it‚Äôs only good for when the dps are using aoe.

This one seems off The Dark Knight came out during the summer of 08, however the episode came out in 06 i think.

I have exactly the same experience as OP. Almost every shaman leveling guide/video have different talents, but everyone says to prioritize strength or even agility, get slow 2H mace and just kinda ignore being OOM all the time. If someone complain about shaman mana issues they just get told to stop sucking and use mp5/bursts in rotation.
---
I'm just getting INT gear now and have much smoother rotation and drink less.

I know of print screen but why the shift wtf does that do?

---
This was always kind of the fun part for me but I play rogue and, man just hiding out, sweating, trying to get some kills for a quest. 
---
Like others said, call them out, someone might know someone who can wreck them. We picked pvp for a reason there‚Äôs bound to be some pvpers willing to fight them. 
---
Try and find alternative spots for your quest items if it‚Äôs collecting shit, a lot of enemies that drop quest stuff can be found in a couple different places. 
---
And pvp skills in your skill tree can be really useful in pve too, so pick some up if you haven‚Äôt and it might save your ass and buy you time to escape
---
This is something for Barrens chat
---
Thats why alot of feral levelling builds dip into balance.
---
Same, but I got the searing gorge FP so I ain‚Äôt even mad.
---
I think literally every warrior on every server gets 2 whispers an hour asking to tank.
---
Mages have an equivalent to Orb of Dar'Orahil, it's the Celestial Orb. Same as warlock, starts at a mage trainer at level 35.

Spirit imo is only good in open world with downtime of looting + running to new mobs/objectives. Int is better if you have little downtime between casting. Either way that is a really high amount of +fire damage. Most I saw at that level on my mage was like +20-30, though I didn‚Äôt go for it. In the end do what works for you
---
Semi-related, I always thought taunts should be usable in PVP. All it‚Äôd do is force the target to target the taunter. That can be useful!
---
I've seen quite a few all caps "insert name is a ninja, warrior stole staff from SM Lib".
---
That thing has nearly 40dps and can be used at 34 lol, if you're not likely to get whirlwind it's a decent choice but quite a lot of people think everyone should greed if a caster doesn't need it.
---
I‚Äôm sick of the bullshit.  Nobody‚Äôs heart was broken by this.
---
I did two we groups back to back as I didn‚Äôt find enough serpentbloom the first time through. Never...Again...
---
Nice so as usual the early abusers profit off something massively whilst everyone else goes without, creating a sort of underclass of people who take much longer to level and have much less gold.
---
You chose a PvP server in a version of the game where world PvP existt, it's working as intended
---
Me calling out an entitled racist horsefucker doesn't really strike me as the one "making the world a worse place"
---
Russian hackers are at it again
---
You can down rank heals to cast faster. Lesser heal downranked casts in a second.
---
There's a couple types of DDoS attacks, and then subtypes within those types (I won't go into subtypes). In a layer 3/4 attack, they are usually volumetric. In this case, they are detected by overall packets inbound to the host. Usually you will have some policy that defines "normal" volume for a protected IP and then determine what is anomalously high. At this point you'd put them under protection. 
---
Then there is layer 7. Layer 7 is hard because it means they are attacking that endpoint with intimate knowledge of the endpoint. I.E. They know either the API, or specific calls that the endpoint provides &amp; how to abuse it. In this case, they can totally pretend to be a legitimate user, and ask a server for a very high computational task with a small request, (give me all players under 60 who's level is divisible by 4 and the square root of their level is also divisible by 4, but first join all the items they have on the list of items found in BFD..yada yada - Fake example but you get the point).  
---
In this case, you need to be "in line". This means you need to have a device that is in the route of the endpoint that is also capable of doing mitigations (a mitigation device is a different device than a router), this enables real time packet inspection for anomalous behavior. Much harder to determine an attack is actually happening, because you have things like slow loris (sends requests segmented VERY slowly and ties up the thread pool of a target) which don't show up under generic volumetric attacks.
---
Generally speaking, in a volumetric attack, with the size of botnets these days, it's incredibly hard to determine what is good vs what is bad on the fly. Sure, we could inspect every packet in depth and add 1-2s per packet, but then that latency is passed on to you, the user. And in this case (WoW, gaming in general), 1-2 seconds in **unacceptable.** So if the port is correct, the payload is somewhat correct, the protocol is somewhat correct, you have to resort to just destination, or source based limiting. 
---
What is destination vs source based limiting? If you know a source should only be sending MAX 500 packets per second, and you're seeing someone send 10k pps. Then you can throttle that source, or block that source, depending on your policies. This is source based limiting. If you know your service can only handle 100k PPS, then you have to cut the packets to 100k PPS. This is destination based limiting. This will happen indiscriminately in most cases, since we can't accurately determine what is good and what is bad. This is why sometimes you have some people who logged in fine, and some who fail every chance. Just pure luck. And depending on the service, their auth server may be the bottleneck for unrestricted access (if they have a separate auth endpoint from world server endpoint &amp; the auth endpoint is under attack).
---
In the long run, botnets are the real reason behind the difficulty of protection. If you have 30 million bots performing 1 request per second (this is not an exaggeration, there are coordinated botnets with 30 million + zombies), then how do you determine who is participating in the attack? This is 30 million requests per second, and generally well beyond the capability of most servers to handle. Furthermore, none of these individual sources are actually sending enough traffic to look suspicious.

In the case of single source attacks, or small source attacks, the UDP protocol is specifically vulnerable to source spoofing. If you craft your packet, and tell your router, "Hey send this packet to L.M.N.O" and modify the packet to have a fake source, the router has NO IDEA that you spoofed the source. Since UDP does no authentication, it just accepts the packet and treats it like a normal packet. Lots of games run on UDP and therefore spoofing is a big issue in these types of attacks.

There's so much I could go into, but that covers the gist of generic attacks and why they are difficult to protect against I think.

If you are the one inviting them to your group they will be joining your layer so you actually won't experience much delay.

I'm certain it has everything to do with it being classic. They may not have wanted to spend the money on extra security for it originally.

If you've put all your points in feral you can start taking it at level 20. If you're speccing balance or resto, you don't get to take it (at least not until you put some points in feral later on, but by the time you get to it, you'll have travel form).

I sir also have my Everglow Lantern taking up a bag slot forever because of the pretty light! :)

More so towards the later dungeons. Though in the 40s most of your tanks for cath/uldaman possibly zf too will be using the armory ravager. Cause aoe dungeon cleave is on the rage.

Personally I love being Alliance in a 40/60 A/H split.

Great bg queue times, and wpvp is difficult as it should be.

I did that back in Vanilla. Fights can take more time, but it‚Äôs certainly doable.
---
It's better to balance spirit and int out.
---
You should be able to fit in 2 blizzards per Nova if you are moving away to max range. It takes some practice but if done right you will end with just about zero mana. It doesn't work on all mobs because they may have higher HP. Just practice it on lower level mobs and you will learn.
---
From crushed to kushed.
---
I love this. Almost hurt myself laughing.
---
Alright so here is a HOT take. People who cry about layering, especially when its related to the world first 60, world first rag, or just say very dumb things like "typical blizzard, rewarding early abusers/no lives for abusing early so now the every man gets punished", are insufferable troglodites who need to seriously assess their thoughts and words.
---
You can not complain about someone who uses layering, then when blizx says its not as abusive as you thing but guess what we will nerf it, infact we will nerf it 2 or 3 times since launch and then cry like a child about you not getting gold, or exp like the abusers did.
---
You can not complain when youre fuckin lvl 14 in barrens 2 god damn weeks in because you have a "real life" when the guy who is world first 60 has practiced this run for literal years. Stayed up 3 days straight, and ONLY ABUSED LAYERING 2 LEVELS BEFORE 60.
---
Same concept for world first rag, you insufferable pieces of filth need to shut the fuck up. It is borderline shameful, cringe, and outright stupid.
---
Thanks all I love you ü§ì

Drop the leveling guide and get creative!

I filtered adibags so I see them stacked and not how much room they actually take, less painful that way

It is 9:10 a.m. in Turkey and it does not connect to [battle.net](https://battle.net). When I open the game directly and manually enter my information, it gets stuck on "connecting" and gives an error message. Anybody else having this issue I wonder?

This is great news. I watch StaysafeTV, he is a very good Warlock, and does not like Voidwalker at all.

35 Rogue, Skinning and Mining (Saving ore like you) I'm sat on 45g. I've just started running a few SM dungeons which seems to be giving decent gold. I don't predict I'll have enough for mount at 40
---
I farmed the crayfish in Desolace looking for the Fishing rod, Made 10 gold on that. Farmed leather and made items to vendor as the AH prices were not worth the wait. Cooked food, at 36 copper for spices sold for 3 silver a piece. Pickpocketed humanoids doubling the money per kill.

Congrats man!

It sounds dramatic, but it's true. It's pretty shitty. Being an adult means that your fun time is limited and usually pretty scheduled. My wife and I did all of the stuff that needed done around the house, got cleaned up, and sat down to play a couple hours of WoW but it was constantly disconnecting so we just didn't get to.
---
It's not the end of the world but it does suck that we were looking forward to this and couldn't because some asshats think it's fun to fuck people over.
---
nope
---
I love that stuff like this matters.
---
You‚Äôre a fuckin loser bud
---
My bet is that you sell your mats on the AH?
---
on bigglesworth there currently a mob that hunts down and basically herds all horde players to tarren mill in order to kill them all. we try to defend ourselves but they have level 40s and 60s helping them out. I cant level there because of it.
---
Just finished my third round tanking it, it's getting familiar and is always fun!
---
All homies are lords in my book
---
That‚Äôs corpsemaker is way better than the crappy polearm, even if it doesn‚Äôt have agility, simply due to the top end damage it does for raptor strike. I use it on my PS 29 twink (which I no longer play).
---
In saying that, I am aware of its upgrade potential for the melee classes who desire it, and always mention prior to anyone getting to the dungeon if they mind I roll on it. What I usually do in fact, is create the group and omit other hunters, Shaman and warriors from the group when creating. Bear tank, my hunter DPS, and 3 clothes = win lol.

Im gonna pinch in my two cents. Played a warrior until level 22 and rolled a rogue. Ofc every body said to go combat sword and that I did. Honestly? It felt like a more boring warrior for me. Decided to switch to daggers and oh boy, it has been a blast to play. Not the most min/max but it is so fun and gets the job done with ease. Plus it fits the whole "rogue" theme so well, not that buccaneer type of shenanigans :p

When you disenchant an object it gets destroyed an in exchange you get some enchantment material like dusts or shards. Those materials are usually sold in the auction house and people buy them and then pay a small fee to an enchanter to enchant their gear. That addon knows what materials you can get while disenchanting and knows their approximate prices in the auction house.
---
The Staff of Jordan is a pretty good object for casters while leveling. You can use it from lvl 35 till 60. The price would depend on the server, but is probably gonna be a couple hundreds

It's a game that's meant to be enjoyed.  Play what you think will provide you with the best experience overall.

that is very normal!

If you really want gold, sell the mats you farm on the AH. This early on prices are high and people buy a lot.

Its funny because I go stealth when people are coming my way because I don't know if they will be trouble. Sometimes they do a 180 and I'm sitting there like dude I'm a pacifist where are you going.

It's been pretty obvious that the media treats anything related to black people as something saintly. That's because they can't comprehend the fact that people can discuss black people and have it NOT come from a place of hatred.

Sure, try Whitedude. I'd like to see what happens then. It's like Twitter drama all over again with the unnecessary bans.

Shame to wear that one (albeit understandable). Twinks later on will pay 50-100g for that cloak!

Level 33 - 1 gold.
---
wow head literally just confirmed it there
---
Even as leveling intellect is more important imo, at least if you plan on aoe grinding. Mana pool and hp benefits far more than plus damage.
---
I run up and lick you in doggo form, before I start hopping around. Because EVERYONE loves a happy puppy. Unless you are hurt then I break character and heal.

I even lick alliance, if the alliance pat, sit, kneel, or other friendly emotes I leave them be...
---
Currently being camped by level 40+ ally's in Hillsbrad. I've been taking names. If I find them in the future I'm going to camp them as revenge. I feel that rage too well.

Players are focused on leveling right now.

I see flagged players every day on a normal realm, but I don't think I've ever actually seen a fight yet. I've done most of the quests in the hotspots too, like Hillsbrad and STV. 
---
Once people reach 60 and get bored, they will start attacking quest hubs and PvP will happen. It's rare right now.

Exactly the same here. I even feel kinda bad about it lol, must be nice to see what the other side is like. But every time I saw a human I just felt like I had to punch it and running past orcs, tauren, undead and trolls I felt like a traitor.

That's cool, but nobody playing classic is going back to that garbage.

Got to do the same thing earlier today.

We were killing Mor'Ladim and a Paladin had just pulled him. Tried to invite, he declined, and just said "No, sorry." We then watched him and his mage friend die and Mor'Ladim leashed to us at half health. Easy kill for us. ;)

Fuck staying alive. As long as it doesn‚Äôt wipe the raid I am gonna meme half the time.

I am trying to convince my guild that taking a melee Moonkin with sulferas to a raid is the most epic of memes.

I think it is because they guys have so many viewers. Normal discussions are not really possible when there are thousands of people in chat at the same time. Copy pasta spam, emotes and whatever else gets recognized quickly is the only "communication" option that's left I suppose.
---
haha
---
lol
---
&gt; EDIT (5:30PM PDT): It looks like the promotion post was deleted from World of Warcraft Brazil's Facebook page.
---
It looks sketchy and they didn't really confirm it anywhere
---
been using it for a few days and have not noticed any issues.
---
"Heart breaking". That is an idiotic thing to say. It's a fucking game. It's an annoyance and frustration. Maybe it even makes your blood boil. But heart breaking it is not.
---
And gains 0 honor. Waste of time.

Accurate AF
---
All pvp servers are unbalanced in favor of the horde.  There is no sanctuary.
---
I know. It's wonderful
---
no idea, they're using enough data to take down blizzard servers/amazon/twitch.etc... so they're probably going to be going to prison soon.
---
Yea I was with guild mates and everyone definitely wanted it to sell, but 2 of us clearly could actually use it. Had the other person rolled greed I probably would have as well and taken my chances, but since I needed on it I felt obligated to equip so as not to ninja.   I‚Äôve got some twink BoE  banked tho so I‚Äôll be set haha.
---
Oh a rogue, what a surprise.

??? Not a troll ??? Literally got banned for it.
---
As a warrior, it's not hard to have a shield and one hander in your bags for tanking.
---
While levelling you suck at DPS, just tank properly.
---
Also if you really won't tank, and end up in a group for DPS, don't taunt mobs off the tank and use some aoe shouts to pull all the mobs to you unless you just want me to watch you die.
---
As a warrior tank I am useless without rage and I have no rage unless I'm being hit. Being handicapped by my own class is embarrassing.
---
Stacking a bunch of int will get you like 3 more spells. Spell power is king.
---
OMG I miss old g4tv. I miss the show called 'portal' specifically. Several episodes are considered to be lost too.
---
That's not how the internet works, if they wanted to block the end point for the reports from accepting hits they would just not serve a response back to the client, or, they would serve a 200 without a payload.
---
By having the server process formatting a response for your client that tells it to DC you then all of these hits will still slow the server down.
---
Also, dude let people play the game. It's their classic as much as it is yours, try and be more accepting!
---
I have hit 20+ on 2 different servers and then re rolled again if your not going to enjoy the game don't both playing
---
I second this.
---
Well, it IS a video game. Killing people in general is usually considered bad!
---
Personally, I don't camp people unless its a revenge sort of scenario. I also don't generally kill people more than 10 levels below me unless its to provoke a reaction. Kill enough low-levels and guards and eventually people will come to stop you. 
---
If someone chooses to be on a PVP server then they are implicitly accepting these things, and to us it adds to our enjoyment of the game. It adds a sense of apprehension all the time. It clearly is not your idea of a good time. To each their own.
---
The higher level you get the less buffs you get because no druids want to shift out of form and no priests/mages want to be completely oom
---
I guess people don‚Äôt understand naming rules for RP servers? People downvoting you must have names like mcStabz or one of the cow pun variants on Tauren characters.
---
I have a dream to re-experience my prime gaming time from 13 years ago. It‚Äôs a bit harder with work, wife and kids to find time for it. But my twinking urge is strong. Gotta lvl up a main first because twinks need support, resources and a lot of gold.
---
Dang. I saw someone selling Bow of Searing Arrows for only 50g and died a little on the inside as I can‚Äôt afford it and a mount! :(
---
You know classic is good when rolling for a chest causes more laughs than 2 weeks of playing retail.
---
lol, its called making money son.
---
Not a dad in 2004, Dad in 2 months. I practice by telling shit jokes to my guild.
---
Jesus what server/faction are you on? i'm ahead of the curve from taking 8 days off after launch so most of the people i meet are all about efficiency and won't stop to fight me, but my mates who are 30 and below are just getting HAMMERED in contested zones.
---
I had to go sit in a zone for 90 minute killing horde the other night whilst studying so my mates could actually quest there, people on mounts were riding round in packs hunting down low levels lol.
---
There was a short reset after the ddos attacks
---
If you can get them to yourself the rock eles in south Badlands drop a lot of grey crap and if you fill empty bags and go sell you can make 10g an hour , it is boooooring but if you have the patients it will get you there, plus it‚Äôs good xp. I know a lock that had the Staff of Jordan drop from them as well.
---
You sound dumb arguing over semantics.
---
How? Even a fast run to 60 is well over 100 hours. 100 hours in 2 weeks on top of working full time? I dont see how it's possible unless you sleep 4 hours a night.
---
False, my good lock. You give chase, hunt them down, and shove a healthstone into their bag!

My servers completely oversaturated with beginner mats.

Good ol‚Äô pen and paper, that‚Äôs what I use üòÇ
---
That's because Blizzard's legal team doesn't fuck around.
---
You know why TF2 is a game run rampant with hacks? Free 2 Play + a company that doesn't care about their platform (Valve).
---
Know why you don't see Blizzard hacks? It's not just good programming. It's their legal team. Nobody wants to sell in that market.
---
There are rules for names on RP servers. Blizz can‚Äôt catch them all so they rely on the community to police the rules.
---
Dungeon bosses take about 30 seconds....raid bosses are usually more like 5 minutes.  Are you mixing up some terms here? Your post reads like you are having a senior moment.
---
There is a dense area of Saltstone Basilisks in south shimmering flats, they drop 4 diff grey items with a good price and a vendor is nearby at the racetrack.
---
I have improved voidwalker and I use agony and corruption then wand and he cant hold threat with his books up to date also so you can probably do ok without it
---
Dude fuckin yes!

It's even in the human intro that he's child king!

And heals for like 30 hp. Very stronK ok tanks with  2k hp.
---
It would take a lot of work, but you can report people for abusing LFG or World Defense chat.
---
Really just want to see if they'd ban for having the same name, but with a different uhh 'skin tone' to it? Not gaining anything from it. Just seeing if the same result would come of it.
---
Between work and queues, I've done most of my good leveling in the wee hours of the morning. I'm 33 but it's cost me a lot of sleep.
---
Excuse me?
---
Have seen a fair share of flagged horde. But also lots of standing next to each other almost questing together.
---
Plus healing and it heals for a couple hundred.
---
That‚Äôs what I appreciates about yas
---
Hmm.   I'll have to check who these flight masters are associated with.  I'm currently only friendly with all the factions...perhaps they're part of their own subfaction.
---
Thats really interesting. I haven't even seen a shaman guide that says to do that. I do vet my guides pretty hard because lots of bads make videos.
---
You. The guy you don't have to worry about.
---
Great write up! Thanks!
---
Considering the lack of aggro tools early on and everybody's apparent lack of ability to focus fire, it's very honest work.
---
Oh 100% agree with you, it‚Äôs 15 years old ect, it‚Äôs been done over and over! Still crazy though haha
---
And *what if* it doesn't result in the same outcome?
---
LF tank RFC last spot, you in?
---
Don't upgrade heroic strike or thunderclap as they're not useful for Leveling.
---
&gt;Imagine going to prison
---
Yep still can't login. I wonder if we're blocked as a region for some reason.
---
Balance druids sit in moonkin form and cast until oom and then they don't really have anything going for them. If you want to shift s lot go feral....
---
This guy needs a pay rise lol.
---
Ignore the folks below, playing on an RP server for the first time with a new group of friends I recently made has been an amazing experience. And people like pussxslayerLOL really do fuck with the immersion.
---
Lvl 27 10 g
---
Yeap. Its been a few hours
---
Has there been any information from blizzard about cross server battleground queues?
---
Why are they deploying a hotfix if:
---
* "This doesn't affect you"
---
* "This doesn't affect the economy"
---
Etc.
---
It means git gud lul
---
This will occur if blizzard rolled back the servers. Rollbacks used to happen a lot back in the day due to server instability and clearly blizz have gone the extra mile for #nochanges lol.
---
Every one else would have been rolled back too so I wouldn't worry about being at a disadvantage or anything.
---
It does suck tho but shouldn't be a common place occurance
---
Either most people on your layer are similar levels and playing in the same zone or blizz is already reducing the number of layers.
---
It's funny b/c it's a low lvl meme and a high lvl super super sad image
---
In HotS she has a line like "My real name is Chronormu. What? No, that's not a boy's name. You clearly you don't understand the fine nuances of Dragon naming conventions.
---
What would people think of a soft system of forced faction balance? Cook up some reasonable metric for the faction balance between servers then make it so that you can only create new characters on the outnumbered faction (probably with some override like a sponsor system so people could still roll on the more populated side if they're going to play with a friend or join a specific guild). They must have considered this. I wonder why they've never played around with it.
---
people are really scared of rogues
---
yesterday I was roaming near the wyverns in 1k needles ( Im ally btw) and this ud warlock sees me and he just backpeddles a big distance into hyenas
---
Look, it's the moment a party member helping you on a quest manages to get the items he needs for himself and you ask him to stick around until you get your drops
---
virtual terrorists? Come on, that waters down the word terrorist. These guys are troublemakers at the worst.
---
Ugh that sucks. Wish they would have said something in game..
---
I like this.
---
That last thread you made didn't get any attention so you're trying again eh?
---
No its not. Battle.net isnt working/not launching/cant install the app or game.
---
all there is is world pvp right now
---
I logged in from Dubai multiple times with literally zero issues. Have you tried using a VPN?
---
Don‚Äôt get discouraged! People are leveling fast and downing bosses... big deal. 
---
A lot of the community has a life outside of WoW. 
---
I can only play every other day maybe 2 hours during the day (nap time)and about 3-4 after wife goes to bed. I‚Äôve had thoughts of I‚Äôm behind and won‚Äôt be able to do raids but the reality is many people are just like us and we will all get there at about the same time.
---
You will be able to find groups and guilds and more than likely you are going to have more in common with them and have similar timelines. 
---
You will enjoy playing with them and more than likely develop a new adult friendship..... kinda rare if you ask me
---
I also recommend you do a /who 27-29 or what ever you level is at the time to remind you of how many people are at the same stage the same time of day your playing.
---
Dedicated Denial Of Ssrvice attack. Basically some asshole somewhere was like "I'm a tool. Im a tool tool tool." And they began to bombard the blizzard servers with packets and packet requests(packets are how data is generally transferred across the internet). Its not a big deal when one computer does it, but no. You see, this tool, or group of tools, weren't hugged enough as children, so they use multiple computers and often times the internet of things to send hundreds of thousands of requests in small amounts of time. Their douche baggerey knows no bounds unfortunately.
---
In the end, they had to revert their servers back a bit to the most recent mass save; meaning your character was rewound.
---
You could do dungeon(s) instead opposite faction can't brother you once inside
---
Was thinking the same thing !
---
Umm...   That's 2 damage in every shot. Do you have any idea how much that could be over the course of the weapon's life?
---
Noticed that too. Maybe it got turned off accidentally with ddos? Zones are definitely way more packed it‚Äôs kind of awesome tbh
---
I was told this lol, good day I picked to go out.
---
This already happened when vanilla was the retail version.
---
Means that because of the DDoS attacks blizz had to reset everyones progress by X time. Sucks but it happened in Vanilla too.
---
the name white is literally flagged by default. all of you folks who choose to die on this hill are just jokes at this point. just pick a goddamn name and stop trying to be edgy
---
Moar dots
---
I thought 30 was when you gained magical powers?
---
If they changed it I'm going to have to call off this Caligulan orgy I've been planning.
---
Neither of those are Horde. Darkshore is alliance and Ashenvale is contested.
---
Only have it for my B&amp;W drawing. Kinda toned down with my painting and fan arts.
---
For questing it cost more because of how much you drink. But play what you want. If you enjoy playing balanced for leveling, do it!
---
For raiding? F it people are going to need to fill slots and they would rather have you for your utility damage/healing depending on the encounter rather than nothing at all. 
---
Pvp? You will be fine don‚Äôt worry :)
---
gfy
---
Thanks &lt;3
---
Exploration xp and fetch quests:)
---
if it was 150% you'd be running backwards..
---
It's contested territory, that is, the two factions are fighting over it, and both factions have towns and outposts and such in the zone. If you're on a server with more horde than alliance, ashenvale especially will often be full of horde players. But you should be able to find some alliance players too.
---
Not sure, the only thing I've done is turn off verbose mode. I can't find any option to specify certain level ranges.
---
Imagine idolizing a script kiddie for doing something that literally anyone can do, now that's a sad existence.
---
Right?  At least the Horde cuts down the trees before they make homes out of them.
---
Disagree. Deep shadow will oom too fast for anything SM or above and won't have the pool to sustain healing on long fights or bigger pulls.
---
That being said, IF you're over-leveling dungeons and IF your tank and DPS are competent, then yes you can heal dungeons in deep shadow. Even then expect to drink A LOT.
---
Warrior
---
Yeah but this is just random world pvp where Im usually solo questing and don't have any support. I can handle any other class no problems. It's just those damn shadow priests that can wreck me lol
---
You do realise that just because you switch out the ''color'' in you name for another, things do change right?
---
But do you know it's origin
---
The insane prices are just people showing off that they got the item. They'll actually try to sell it when BGs come out.
---
If he's having troubles, why not?   
---
He can easily toggle it on/off. Don't understand the huge deal about it.
---
Killing Alliance scum is never a waste of time.
---
Buy jokes aside, it's a game you do what you enjoy in it.
---
I really wanted to like warlock.  I never played it before.  Got to 20 and was over it.  Rerolled and love it
---
dwarf rogues are super rare
---
I think the server restarts earlier after the DDoS also pushed some layering changes.
---
Changing layers is incredibly difficult now.
---
Is there any information on how long this "promo" is available? Currently LVL 39 and if it's a limited time sort of deal I'd like to know :)
---
https://getsharex.com
---
Lol
---
No changes, amiright?
---
18g by lv 33
---
*sad gnome noises*
---
Dude must have felt like the solved a rubix cube with his eyes closed
---
They are actively reducing layering on all servers. They said most servers are sub '10'. I think my "Medium during the day and High during night"-Server only has two.
---
Gz!
---
/s ?
---
&gt;  expert in 5 professions
---
same but none of mine are crafting so I havent spent on them except the books
---
Great news :D
---
As a priest, I get quite a few whispers asking to heal someone through a quest just because I'm in the same zone. Or random invites with no messages. Or dungeon requests, which I assume they are just spamming every priest in a certain level range through /who.
---
Personally not a fan of the tactic. If I was looking to do that quest or dungeon I would be saying so in general chat or LFG, or I'd respond to your request in chat. Spamming in whisper seems rude unless I'm within sight of said person who is asking about a local quest.
---
Anyone know if you get anything if you already have BfA? Like free game time or something?
---
Me trying to build and keep threat vs the mage in my party throwing a blizzard on every mob
---
Pretty much anything, but gnome mages.  You see those buggas everywhere.
---
Any of your name's start with T?
---
1g left after just buying my mount, but it was so worth it
---
Because it does, but they have to give an appropiate PR response, never ever they will acknowledge something as their fault, or a mistake, or having made the wrong decission. They're extremely well trained to avoid any blame and most of the time they ignore issues until they become public.
---
Finally getting to level 10 on my warrior
---
Well level 35 is not even halfway XP/time wise, let alone the time you'll spend at level 60. Better reroll now rather than wishing you did later on. On the bright side you have a warlock alt for farming/soulstone botting outside raids if you're into that :)
---
If you create a fantasy world, you will come up with how things turn out for everyone and everything in the future, even if it's quite loose.
---
Almost every expansion we have seen in wow now was in process back in 2006-2007 already. They have a long plan for wow.
---
If I recall correctly, warriors doesn't get rage unless they are taking the hits. (Hits builds their rage, which fuels their skills)
---
So shielding them, makes their job harder. 
---
So unless it's an emergency, I wouldn't shield a warrior tank :)
---
I don‚Äôt care.
---
I was healing an SM Cath group that was going the whole instance in like 6 pulls.
---
Was me as a priest, warr, and 3xfrost mages.
---
Counting resets and drinking it was ~48k xp/hour.
---
Ahh I wish I could play this game again with fresh eyes!
---
Welcome! Don't be hating on The Horde, though... :(
---
Thank god
---
You honestly think blizzard releasing a statement is going to stop the constant whining they're dealing with on the forums, etc? They're much better off releasing a fix, however minor and bullshit than simply saying "dw guys, we've looked at it and you're wrong".
---
The other thread was full of "and we should trust blizzard why?", etc and so are the forums.
---
Don't some addons alert you even when the enemies are stealthed around you? That seems pretty cheap imo
---
Im reporting all the really bad names aswel, and people that keep talking in another language in general chat even when told not to do that like 5 times.
---
Do you do commissions dude? This is absolutely amazing.
---
"Push his agenda"? You mean, the pretty obvious double standards when it comes to race talk? Sure.
---
Why?
---
You can use the twitch app to install add ons. They're segregated classic add ons so its easy to download and install.
---
Probably just reduced, but I noticed that in Stormwind earlier. It was insanely packed.
---
I would assume druid considering how everyone thinks they are 100% trash apparently.  Warriors and priests are always underrepresented though.
---
Me: Looks away while handling in STV...
---
The rumor is that‚Äôs it‚Äôs a strategic leak. 
---
It was announced and then pulled.
---
The idea is blizzard wanted returning classic players to know if they get burned out or lose interest in classic they can go to retail and blizzard keeps them as a subscriber for a few more months.
---
I just got my mount yesterday right as I hit 40 (rogue). Had just enough, was left with 32s afterwards. Actively saved since lvl 25, skipped most skills after lvl 20 except sinister strike, eviscerate, and instant poison. I was about 25g at 30, 50g at 35. I was getting a good 7g per level mostly questing in STV with the last few levels.
---
Level 12, 2g. Haven't had too much time to play. :(
---
Where was your Lok'tar Ogar on the Broken Shore? Victory or Death, my ass.
---
You good
---
Use vpn it works. sadly with increased latency (usually i would disable vpn while i am gaming. sadly i can't atm)
---
Did you consider... I don't know... grouping up with people?
---
I hope you like your city jaina, Ruler of Theramore, because sometimes, life change in a blast.
---
Also on rattlegore. Wait till I get to hillsbrad was nutty today once the servers came back on
---
Monkeyquest, shows good instructions. Try that.
---
not seeing as many rogues this time around. I miss them
---
Well that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm hoping to find out. To see if the result actually does change or not.
---
If you want a stupid name just go play on all those other servers for pve/pvp and skip the rp servers. 
---
And if you dont get that, and think people reporting you are losers that means a rp server is not for you.
---
Okay? Here's your $0.12 dude hope you don't starve this week
---
Nothing wrong with that. Can help prevent some serious pain.
---
As a rogue, you shall pay for your insolence.
---
Everyone hated the proc back then, and farming stuff a few levels lower than you is pretty smooth with any weapon close to your current level.
---
And it costs so much mooncloth. I believe 12? So that's 48 days worth of cd.
---
Updating my mouse software fixed this for me!
---
To be honest with people being ooc 99% of the time, there isnt much immersion to begin with.
---
But yeah people with names like that really are too far.
---
wtf, how long does it take to go from 0% to full when drinking?
---
EU too unfortunately and roll backs are as short as humanly possible, usually minutes so you'd need to have been playing when your server started to get DDoSed to be at risk.
---
56 min long vid√©o, No sound, no cut, no animation, Kill level 40 with level 53, you are a disgrace to the horde.
---
Fuck off we're full
---
You can throwaway that stone btw.
---
Yea I do but I kinda switched styles in the last year. I could do a painting if it's something interesting enough and the budget is good :) thanks&lt;3
---
Things good, reals are getting better by the hour.

Check your region in the Blizzard launcher before you press the Play button?

What do you mean?

Did you join?

You should whisper him everyday for an invite, we send you one just tell him it's too hard.

Have you tried silverpine and hillsbrad? Great zones but you have to  dip into the barrens around 17-21

For a white dude, you sure know a lot about racial segregation.

Damn bro, who hurt you?

Any lucky drops by chance? Or farming being done? I'm a warlock myself and I've made a little over 100g selling frost oil.

Lol what? No.

This post makes no sense

This, please use this and not trade chat :/
---
Funnily, Maraudon isn't a cave either. At least not the area after Cerebras.
---
same. also if i run by you. also if i see you. i chased someone earlier and made them wait for me to buff them :p
---
r/RetiredGIF
---
You've done the math the opposite way. 
---
One roll 1-100 lands 100 1/100 of the time.
---
In order to roll a 100 on the next sequential roll, it is another 1/100 chance.
---
Mathematically represented as (1/100)^2
---
Or 0.0001.
---
Or 1/10,000
---
In order to then roll two more rolls sequentially and land on any one number and then again on that number, these are again 1/100 chances each.
---
Mathematically represented as (1/100)^4
---
Or 0.00000001
---
Or 1/100,000,000
---
Well this is not a private server so, its his Rep on the line. Just ignore the child.
---
oh, I just seen other posts with people adding that, apologies I guess.   
---
Im just new to the game so I have no idea how to go about talking to people or whatever u know?
---
oh sure, thalnos
---
How is a rogue needing a dagger a ninja? Theres not many options in the 30s
---
Lol yeah I noticed that in classic too. I think in 2004 my graphics were too bad to even really see the stuff on the roof to know it wasn‚Äôt a cave
---
Thanks, but I'll pass...
---
derivative but good, I like it
---
38 with 250 alchemy at ~30g.  I sacrificed my mount for alchemy levels.

I would always int shout the first nova. Frost mage duels ended up as a bit of a game of chicken wherein if I trinket before coldsnap, I lose and vice versa if they have to snap before I trinket.

I have carpal tunnel and a keyboard aggravates it after 20 minutes but I can play all day on a controller with no pain.

I will /gquit if a guild seems like they‚Äôre not very toxic.

Excellent guild name.

and the rest of the world while we're at it lol? spotlighting assholes and outlaws is counterproductive. they feed off the negative attention, then all you get is more fuckery.
---
Not seen many paladins, and no paladin tanks so far.
---
hes a fucking twat.
---
Easiest way I have found is to do dungeons and start talking with people.
---
Nah come play on Sulfras!
---
It was at this same point that I re-rolled on a PvE server.
---
Honestly what am I doing wrong? I am doing the exact same thing, currently have 4 gold at level 30. I have the same professions. What do I need to do? I‚Äôve had some success auctioning things I skinned but everything else I vendor
---
Just had the same except with double 1s. 
---
Been playing since BC and never seen that
---
Agreed in raiding it is. Leveling up not so much. Good luck aoe farming with a mana pool big enough for 2 blizzards.
---
Lol only if you're a Tauren
---
Hangout in Goldshire and you‚Äôll make a ton of friends
---
Maybe it's just me but I like it. Its calming to me. Grinding mobs is fun.
---
Now if only I had actual keen eyes on stream
---
You have to visit contested zones to level up, there is no other way.
---
there is no bgs, if you are raptor striking more than once every 15 minutes you're fuckin up
---
I always wonder: do people really have hard time with remembering name Sylvanas correctly or is writing it SylvANUS intentional?
---
Maladath is from BWL though and that's not ready until phase three.
---
Hold on to it for a while or it wont sell for much.
---
About 3 dollars and 50 cents
---
The funniest thing is I see no reason it would be incredibly demanding. The chances of it going to a fourth roll are almost literally nil. The game regularly does at least that many rolls in one action, I know I've seen like 5 or 6 procs on the 2% chance to hit an extra time items.
---
No it‚Äôs not
---
That feels like an oxymoron.
---
All of the ones about the DDOS attacks that are all over the front page
---
Some ass tried to charge me 2g with my mats to craft, lmao nope  20 minutes later I got it crafted for 50 silver.
---
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm there yet? Just level 10, and I don‚Äôt even know how to start doing that stuff, haven‚Äôt even been playing a week you know?
---
Have fun?
---
Yo, anyone use dual monitors to play Classic?
---
Wait until you start seeing twinks popping up, then get it on the Auction house. Someone else will have one and they will be too greedy, undercut them by half and you‚Äôll probably still get a fair amount!
---
Did alliance win?
---
Yeah. Damn rogues. No, you are not supposed to focus a completely separate target to build longer combos. Because that literally doubles the total threat I have to generate over the course of a fight. Dear god. How do rogues even choose their targets? I would think you would just look for the target with the most sunders on it and hit that.
---
It's going for about 15g on Sulfuras, but I don't expect it to sell considering no one really has that kind of gold to throw around right now. I'd recommend hanging onto it for a while.
---
Does that make the DDOS attacker the current Lich King?
---
I've played Horde since Vanilla and switched to Alliance for Classic to join a specific guild with my SO and 2 friends. I'm having growing pains and homesickness for the Horde.
---
I'm hoping that new memories will make it worth while and I'll have fun regardless of what side I play on. 
---
(I miss playing an Undead a lot.)
---
He‚Äôs not going to get a life sentence. Legally it‚Äôs a single set of facts and it would run concurrently anyway and they‚Äôre very unlikely to give a max sentence because he‚Äôs probably going to plea out for a fraction of the max.

People spell it as its pronounced, and end of her name is always pronounced 'nus'
---
This games fucking beautiful, even after 15 years. 
---
I know there's more grass and that but I've always loved the look of old azeroth and the day / night cycle.
---
Lmao was this me who feared you? In Arathi Highlands on Kurinnaxx?
---
Farm stacks of leather and just vendor them. You don‚Äôt need to buy all your new spells when you level. Some you won‚Äôt even need. I would stay away from anything that costs money except for repairs. If you want to make some decent gold when you‚Äôre tired of questing I‚Äôd recommend farming turtles in alterac mountains. You‚Äôll get a lot of leather and they have some decent gray drops that vendor pretty well.
---
\&gt; you believe that just paying the sub means you'll have no downtime, at all    
---
Have had multiple times over the course of two weeks. You're refusing to acknowledge this launch has had multiple issues and it's sort of cringe and pathetic. Get Activision's dick out of your mouth.
---
Always wanted to do this but when I think of that hellhole WC I decide against it.
---
Rape is funny
---
im 39 and have 103 gold. I made it by farming shellfish off the darkshore coast
---
Lol y‚Äôall act like I‚Äôm actually upset. Just a general PSA
---
It‚Äôs Iron man Tony Stark
---
Honestly the gold seems to ramp up right around 35+ I was about the same as you, now at 61g at 37. So I feel like i might just make it after all, or at least be close
---
It's not a waste of time. Every mid-high level zone (20+) is gonna be a contested zone. If you don't want to deal with that, roll on a pve server.
---
WHERE IS MANKIRKS WIFE
---
My record is 11 so far
---
I've had this issue for a long time on both retail and classic. Turning off Foreground FPS Limit completely fixed it, even though it doesn't seem like it should have anything to do with your mouse.
---
That ain't something you greed on lmao
---
As a rogue I must say that yes, whatever it is, I probably did something to deserve it.
---
How does your character model look so good?! Mine looks like a triangle with eyes on it :(
---
I'm sure the druid will really appreciate being able to heal their pet and all the shadow damage. Full guild run except for me, it's really my fault for even joining the group.
---
Don't play PvP servers then.
---
Prnt Scrn
---
2 months or so
---
I still don't think they are overrepreented. I have never been in a group and thought "we have too many arms warriors".
---
Screw that, if you roll on an RP server and can't even put in the miniscule effort of having a name that isn't silly then you can get shafted.
---
The PvE/PvP to RP/RPPvP server ratio is something like 20:1. What about \*their\* classic experience?
---
M-16 assault rifle just lookin for love

Wow! Thank you for such a thoughtful answer. I‚Äôve already started getting everything downloaded. Thanks again!

Whereas a rogue of the opposite faction coming out of stealth in front of you is code for "let's be friends for now and share this questing area."
---
 [https://www.wowhead.com/item=34227/deadmans-hand](https://www.wowhead.com/item=34227/deadmans-hand) is similar if you're after the freeze proc.

Are you kidding me? All I see everywhere are warriors.

It's still down for me (Oceanic). I thought the realms were back on?

I'm level 27 and literally the last 3 groups I was in while questing had at least 3 warriors

Thus, in an upcoming patch (in the weeks following launch), we will be adding restrictions to the Classic add-on API that will significantly limit this add-on and others like it.
---
In line with what we shared at BlizzCon last year, we intend to be very careful about allowing add-on functionality that might undermine aspects of the social dynamics that are core to the Classic experience, even in cases like this where it‚Äôs clear that the addon author had no ill intent and was simply trying to provide a service to the Classic community. Ultimately, if a streamlined group-finding system was something we considered compatible with Classic, we would have kept the modern Premade Group Finder tool rather than choosing to remove it from the Classic client.
---
It‚Äôs difficult to articulate a clear-cut rule for exactly when an add-on crosses the line. However, when an add-on goes beyond presenting information or providing aesthetic customization, and attempts to create an interconnected social network that relies on other players also using that same add-on, we are likely to scrutinize it particularly closely.
---
How do you setup the dual monitors though?
---
There are two schools of thought here.
---
Idea A:  you always use Need only if you use the item / Greed otherwise.  
---
Idea B:   Idea A is only for BoP stuff, but expensive boe are Need for everybody, because of the financial value.
---
I am not saying A or B is better, that is a matter of opinion. I am saying BOTH sides have good arguments going for them.

He also made good use of layering to get more mobs to kill

And I thought thor was a god...

 Cant happen to me, I hold right click when I run. Prevents the turning entirely

Where did you see people say that they got the expansion after hitting 60? I've looked everywhere, couldn't find any information :[

I prefer the torch in westfall by the lighthouse. Gotten from the ghost. Horde can get it as well! He's the only horde friendly npc in westfall.

The guides aren‚Äôt fully made with the intention of you leveling on a pvp server; they‚Äôre just giving you the fastest route. You‚Äôll have to get used to questing in contested zones or roll on a pve server.

Meeting stone.

I cant login to us.battle.net pages or log on into the game? Is this happening to everyone or just me?
---
as a warrior my self, yes its nice, but... AH is nicer \^\^( for the crests )
---
Don't get me wrong, I love pvp and ganking. But not this kind of bullshit. Read again.
---
It's not really "what people believe they should be", Blizzard has said since original launch that stuff like corpse camping is fair game on a PvP server.
---
not even close. Bgs open in p3
---
Leaving just one ore does more harm than good, what a dummy
---
same I was excited on my rogue when I got the electrocutioner sword and then I see its main hand
---
still use it tho cuz massive dps
---
That's a meeting stone. It's basically just there as a place for the group to meet once you get a group together for the dungeon.
---
Watching unflattering depictions of zoomers getting their guts torn out is disturbingly cathartic.
---
Ahem.... which server....? Cuz ahh...  no reason.
---
wait until p3. I am also waiting for selling my sfk blade
---
It's unbalanced because noobs like you can't hack the pressure.. go join a rp server if you don't like pvp
---
Wouldn‚Äôt it be 1/98 x 1/100 x 1/100? 
---
You can‚Äôt roll 100 and be beat by 1 twice
---
Indeed a meeting stone. In later patches it could be used to summon partymembers.
---
The people who got that high level mostly got it by grinding dungeons with the occasional person getting there through layer abuse. No one right now is ‚Äúrich‚Äù. There is not enough money int the economies right now to be rich. So just chill out. They said they would be reducing it as time went on so don‚Äôt act surprised when they do.
---
At lower levels, especially with low rage, the argument can be made for higher dps with sunder and armour reduction of the mob. Charge, rend, sunder keeping shout up / hamstring kiting with 2h.
---
I believe it is still going on lol
---
About tree fitty
---
Two options:
---
hold on, like people here tell you.  or  
---
sell it to an investor (who plans to make a profit later on)  
---
it's very tough to put a number on it now
---
nope, idk when that came in tbh
---
Unfortunately I‚Äôm horde on a different server. But I am considering on an alliance alt very soon. But I‚Äôll be level 1 if that‚Äôs okay üòÇüòÇ

Can you connect to an oceanic server and see if it still lags?
---
I saw about 30 different alliance yesterday (im a hordie) in Tanaris and not a single one attacked me. I have a translated macro to say "HA L L O" to alliance so maybe they like the greeting :D
---
I even helped an alliance druid who had 3-4 mobs on him. I charged in and pulled 2 off of him to save his life. Later on I was in a similar situation and that same druid pops out of stealth to save MY life. Thank you Felix!
---
oh hi wendy
---
yeetus my neetus
---
You do know the name of the game is WARcraft, right?
---
Honestly it‚Äôs one of the things I miss from Vanilla, the immersive feeling of Alliance vs. Horde (or Orcs vs. Humans from back in my day) before Azeroth got all namby-pamby kumbaya with the handholding and swaying as we fight Scourge/Legion/etc instead of each other...as it was meant to be!
---
üòã
---
Did you ever figure out how to use addons like questie on Mac? I can't seem to figure it out myself.
---
Anytime I see a lower level warrior I try to give them a healthstone.
---
But if it ain't one of the 5%, then it means that the percentages are made up and then there wouldn't even be a 5% chance in the first place. This is quite deep
---
uhm we eat them alive

Each 5 shellfish lets you turn in a repeatable quest that gives you 55s

are they still playing, i'd thought the attention span of their audience wouldn't stretch 2 weeks

Hey, I am kinda friendly. I PvP mostly to help out allies getting their asses kicked or getting 1v2'd.
---
Buuuuut I have misjudged situations and helped the assholes sometimes. Morality is hard in a war, okay?
---
Not really possible for the way they've implemented it, so far as I understand. A layer is a copy of the entire world, not just one zone.
---
insert very panicky "we don't have small penises" cries from the ddossers here
---
Watch out Leonardo. There‚Äôs new talent on the block
---
&gt;Flurry indicates that it increases attack speed, but isn't consumed by Heroic Strike, even though HS replaces a basic attack. Does using HS negates Flurry, or does it beneficiates from it without consuming it?
---
I'm unsure to the mechanics of flurry in classic because I didn't play much Fury back then. I would assume it increases the speed of your auto attacks, but perhaps HS just doesn't consume the stack as a bug or strange working as intended mechanic. Like I said, I'm unsure. 
---
&gt;A random player advised my to replace HS by Sunder Armor, arguing that, because nearly all my damage come from AA, it will improve it while giving me more rage by not using HS. It makes sense, but I'm not so sure. Could you confirm that?
---
If you are tanking at lower levels there is almost never a reason to HS over sunder. Sunder increases the group wide damage by reducing armor, is instant, and HS consumes rage on an auto that would otherwise give rage back so its rage negative. Sunder armor is far less rage negative and you can stack it on multiple targets making it way more efficient. 
---
 &gt;A lot of guides seem to recommend Blood Craze as a talent. However, it seems absolutely terrible. The healed amount is ridiculous, and criticals happens so rarely that I decided not to take it, and replaced it by Improved Demoralizing Shout (seeing how much I use it when tanking). Did I make the right choice?
---
Its because you don't know the silly mechanics of class with crits. Basically what you want to do is setup a macro to charge in then sit. When you are sitting you will be crit and this will trigger blood craze. You want to do this while soloing as well to get the single crit hit and trigger the passive. If you went unbridled wrath and you went improved demo while not taking blood craze then yes you made a mistake. As far as tanking in fury goes I've always disagreed with people that say to level with it if you are going to be doing dungeons. It is certainly faster and better for solo until 40 then swap to arms but if you are going to tank as well Arms is better imo because of tac mastery and anger management being very good for tanking lower level dungeons. Basically it makes it so you can charge in, get a bunch of rage, swap to defensive, hit demo/battle shout, then start sundering. Anger management tooltip also doesn't tell you but it gives you increased rage generation as well (not much but it does add up). 
---
Anyway, I suggest watching this and reading a few guides as there are a lot of less than obvious intricacies to warrior tanking that you might not realize if you never played vanilla-Wotlk era.

Downed for over 12 hours for me. From Vietnam just wanting to play OCE servers with my friends. I can't even log in to the app, can't access Blizzard's support sites or even forums...
---
Heartbreaking could become the next epic or awesome.
---
But, is that a paladin with a crossbow? New spec confirmed.
---
People tested it on beta and it didnt work. However, if you are in a group you can log off and having the leader reset while you are offline. Then you log back in and you will be ported to the entrace and the instance will be resetted.
---
Not to mention that they were all gnome/dwarf except the Druid.
---
That‚Äôs not a devil growing in there, it‚Äôs Varian coming down to tell you you‚Äôre doing the right thing.

It's not like they're smart enough to understand anyway.
---
Can someone please confirm that Renew doesn't build aggro until the Priest is in combat?
---
I.e. Pre-casting Renew before a pull will not pull/build aggro to the Priest until the Priest casts another spell to get into combat
---
Vendor or AH ? Sell raw or potions? What are you picking up and what are you crafting? Pls and thanks.
---
That was actually there in Vanilla, though.
---
Aww bless, grats to you :)
---
Your issue isnt with bears, it's with tanking in classic in general. Threat generation isn't very strong and options are very limited. Both tanks that the Horde have access to use rage and resource generation is slow. Just get used to losing aggro to overeager DPS who start attacking before you even pull and won't stop attacking when they pull aggro.
---
Unless the other person is also doing the same thing.
---
They're based in the UK based on their uk slang name lol

He recovered his character right after this and still plays on it.

IMO phase 2 will cause a lot of people to stop playing on pvp servers. seriously, not kidding.

---
You are aware you have a minimum range limit?
---
Fuck me for having an opinion that goes against the financial interests of blizzard right? How outrageous of me to believe that being ganged by 5 druids all acting simultaneously from one input is unfair. Seriously, imagine it in any other game. Cod, fortnite, rocket league, whatever. It would be banned immediately. Only reason it isn't here is because Blizz make money from the extra accounts. 
---
"its always been like that"
---
"Well go make your own game"
---
These aren't arguments, nor are they logically addressing my issue with multiboxing in pvp.
---
So like PW: SHIELD if u have like 80 health left, and get attacked at the same time by two attacks higher than 80, they will both be absorbed?
---
Do u know how simultaneos the attacks have to be?
---
There seem to be two schools of thought regarding Warlock leveling: Staysafe's imp focused build and [Dive's drain tanking build which uses the succubus.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ccxosl/dives_drain_tanking_guide_for_warlock_leveling_in/)
---
Drain tanking wins for me because it makes you incredibly tanky, has the same kill speed as with the imp and you have zero downtime between mobs whereas the imp runs out of mana pretty quickly, is extremely squishy and doesn't have any utility when you get jumped on a PvP server.
---
An ally waved at me once in ashenvale, then i killed him
---
I always loved my Blueberry, but now I am a druid that loves his bear form.
---
Give me one good argument why Needing for money isn't greedy?
---
My dream is to find a woman who‚Äôd play troll female.
---
I bind auto shot to the 2 key.
---
lowkey glad i didn't play wow back in the day. i can only imagine kid me discovering the succubus.
---
I was excited to play and then that happened and it suckes butt
---
I thought I read that he only did that from like 55 to 60?
---
maybe if you're doing little dick frost damage.  all except maybe the latest dungeons WHILE LEVELING don't take 30s.  also you don't go oom casting 10 fireballs so great excellent we're using all of our mana to kill the boss fast.  not sure why you're talking to me, be gone pleb.
---
it thinks it can disenchant into stuff it won't... so the numbers are just off it seems.
---
I honestly don‚Äôt know what the fuck to say if you think I think he was serious. Jesus, I thought it was a funny clip. I don‚Äôt hate the guy, neither I watch his 10 hours streams. I guess that why forums hate him, his fans try to defend him even though he doesn‚Äôt need to be defended.
---
Both are great classes. Play what you you think you'll enjoy more. Mages are probably the best class in the game, however.
---
You bastard....
---
A small step for me, a large step for mankind
---
Try not having a great life and gf. Fuck this ddoser scum tho
---
And that's how it felt the first time I played wow way back when. Congrats you're a vet now
---
6 months is my guess
---
I love how all the wow classic players are just there to enjoy the game. There's far less trolls or people who are impatient with new players. I played over 10 years ago, but in the end, people were just too competitive. I don't get that feeling with wow classic. For me, it feels like returning home after being abroad for over 10 years.
---
I'm a 40 warrior and would love a tip to where you farmed money for your mount. I'm like 50g off and it's rough out there.
---
No it's something you pass on, unles you have tailoring.
---
I don‚Äôt see how you see me as the racist here... I don‚Äôt think there should be any pride month personally. Be who you are and what you want to be. Get no special treatment for anything.
---
being undead helps tremendously with this farm
---
Nope, still can't hold aggro. The blueberry is useful for two things only, and that's sacrificing it if you're in deep shit or sending it into a group of mobs while you loot/use a quest item in the middle of them.
---
That's good to know! I'll definitely enjoy both, I just want to make sure that if we're both ice mages one of us wouldn't be redundant during dungeons and raids etc? Just so we can play together...
---
For sure
---
So did he not hardly quest at all?
---
Thanks, it's terrifying
---
Rank 3 is 2,5s cast for 135-158 healing. You would need like +600 healing for it to be viable, but then tanks would also have 12k hp.
---
Its just a lower level healing spell, you replace it with Heal and Flash Heal and later on Greater Heal when tanks have good gear.
---
Can you connect to the oceanic servers from an EU account?
---
Grats
---
Got that too on my shaman. Didn't take a pic, but yeah. WC loot is nice.
---
DO NOT pick mage if you want to join groups together with your friend.
---
Most 5 man groups won;' need 2 mages, but 1 mage and 1 other will be great.
---
If you just play together, out in the world, 2 different classes will also be better , you can cover each other's weak points instead of having the same weak points.
---
Been seeing lots of people pass on chests, their loss
---
That's because the attacker stopped. Expect it again tomorrow unless he already got caught and arrested
---
You definitely won't have any trouble there. You'll find a ton of mages in raid groups and generally only a couple hunters.
---
*suffering is our speciality*
---
Holy shit
---
Id recommend rolling a hunter in this situation. Since you‚Äôll both be cloth users, it‚Äôll eliminate the need to contest drops. Some groups might have an issue accepting double mage DPS, but in the current low-level dungeons it‚Äôll be easier with two mages. I‚Äôd further narrow it down to your play style- Do you want to have a pet that can do damage/tank while you ‚Äúkite‚Äù mobs/enemies, or do you want to be a glass cannon dependent on mana?
---
You're not mixing up the base value and +healing are you? Spiritual Healing (10% healing) and Improved Renew (15% healing) doesn't scale with +healing. It's a flat base value. 
---
 I'm not familiar with your addon so I can¬¥t testify to its accuracy. Did you do testing of your own to determine that you have +xx healing? Which spell did you test it with? They all benefit from +healing to a different percentage (co-efficiency). Renew is the only spell that benefits 100% from +healing so you could do some testing with that one.

I was waiting for my party outside Black Fathoms Depths when a Paladin ran out, with less than 25% health. I feared him just to mess with him but he ran straight into two elite monsters and had to fight for his life.  I don't know what became of him but I hope he is doing ok.

---
If you think wisp form is useless you clearly don't value your time as a resource in classic.
---
If you want to equip it, press need, if it's for the auction house or the vendor, greed. Please also consider that some classes will get more use out of some blue items than you so be considerate. Eg I passed on some nice +9 agi +6 int +3 spirit ring as a priest since that's a hunter ring and we had one in the party.

I'm actually in the same boat, and fairly certain it's not my ISP or hardware. Getting huge spikes of 1500+ every day, that last for 10 mins at a time. Done everything I can think of to troubleshoot it and had a tech team check out all the connections and the neighbourhood.
---
Would love to get to the bottom of it, and wish you the best of luck. I know first-hand that it feels like hell.
---
I'm central Canada and playing West Coast and have tried without add-ons (made no difference.
---
I read it again, don't really see what they did wrong tbh. Like the guy above said, maybe a PVE server instead
---
All the Things. Should have it. And more. Be careful as it‚Äôs a deep hole.
---
Play a different class. Say you main a tank, you could alt a ranged dps, something completely different than your main.
---
It can be pretty cool running past guilds rping, makes the world feel more immersive.
---
I use ElvUI. It has filters that work amazingly on its party and group unit frames, allowing me to see who has what HoTs, buffs, debuffs etc at a glance

You can loot the serpentbloom outside the instance too of you missed a couple.

NB: This only applies for groups with STRANGERS!!!  
---
1.  because the rule goes for everybody, it's not 1 guy being greedy over others, it's all FIVE players in the group getting an equal chance of a serious cash item.   they will obviously all roll on high value items from ALL classes under this system.  
---
2.  Less chance of actual ninjaing.   In PuG you know this will happen,   your system:   warlock rolls need, warrior rolls greed, mage rolls greed,  hunter rlols greed...   all good....  boom Rogue rolls Need,  rolls a 67, warlock roll a 43.  drama,  people mad, rogue leaves party...  etc.
---
If all just roll need this cannot happen.   
---
Now if you are with a group of guildies, trusted friends....  Sure  just give the item to the guy who is the appropriate class and the rest roll greed.
---
I solo capped snowfall as a warlock in TBC to turn it in to a turtle. Got a few hate PMs.
---
Agreed, don't be distracted by the mobs. Loot is of the utmost importance.
---
Viable means that something is capable of working and when there are guilds killing Rag with 32 people, wearing greens, and no resist gear, everything outside of like Paladin tanking perhaps, is viable, it's just harder.

Yeah and the G stands for gay, but I see and hear plenty of people say it as an insult

Agility to weapon. I got TMH, TB and AD rep up
---
Not sure if it was just because I was level 42, but I did them solo as mage casting fireballs (the only non essential frost spell I upgrade for cases like this where the mob is immune lol), granted they did hurt!
---
It's a good thing that Alliance are not very clever.
---
I would love to have the ability to show how much my heal is going to heal the target. But I comfortably use my keyboard binds for healing and mouse 4/5 buttons for targeting group members (shift modifier as well). Could I use healbot for this and just not do the clicking part, or would I be better off getting a different addon?
---

Blizzard is at fault for allowing themselves to get DDOSed, they made their server infrastructure insecure, otherwise a DDOS would be impossible.
---
Idk why people need the honor system to have fun for play the game ¬¨. ¬¨

Like if you do the same thing with the honor system, what change? You get like some kills and points. But it's so less you get there it will not change anything in your ranking.

---
I accidentally fed my 22-pound catfish to my cat. Very sad.
---
No, those talents are completely unrelated, not sure why you ask about them. The talent I do mention is supposed to turn 25% spirit into +healing. It should give me about 50 (200*0.25). I am not sure why or from where the rest came from.
---
All deja is supposed to do is add together and show your stats more clearly. Whether it's accurate or not I do seem to be getting the bonus healing.
---
I tested it with Heal, it gets around 200 extra healing (just eyeballing it), which matches up with the coefficient (250*0.85).
---
When Battlegrounds come out (PvP), the level brackets are 10-19, 20-29 etc. People make characters called Twinks which they level to 19, 29 etc and gear them out in the best stuff so that they have a huge advantage. The 10-19 bracket is very popular for twinks, so this item will be very beneficial for classes like Rogue or Hunter that use agility.
---
Implying the horde is incapable of disposing of even a dead alliance member? Seems about right.

Nothing wrong with being a friendly rogue bro!  I just laugh when folk say rogues are evil because it's mostly true.

Just keep doing you and you will soon build a rep as being the friendly neighborhood rogue :)

---
It‚Äôs never too late. Classic will be popular for a long time.

It‚Äôs based on the last vanilla patch before the prepatch. The expansion prepatch is always last expansion + 1 version, so TBC was 2.0, WotLK was 3.0 and so on.

Off course, fucking with an ugly horde, even for all the money of the world, is the last thing a prostitute would want to do.

Ah what a legend. Thanks for that. The thing that sorted it for me was minimizing the screen in your steps. Otherwise I couldn't move or anything. Great, still, it's very hard to get used to. Killing one mob at a time, with one spell, is tough haha. But it's good to return quests, buy stuff, while I can't log on my machine. 
---
Again, what a legend. Thank you mate :)
---
Pros and cons depend heavily on what you as a player prefer. Asking on this sub, most answers you'll get are "retail sucks" or similar. I'll try to put it as unbiased as I can. I play both games and enjoy both relatively equally!
---
Retail: 
---
pros) more cosmetic and race choices, a lot of quality of life changes, expansions, highly populated, gold is easy to get, graphics are "better" but this shouldn't effect your enjoyment
---
cons) harder to socialize / people don't group up with you randomly in the world to complete stuff most of the time
---
neutral/depends what playstyle you like) mobs scale with you, there are some in store cosmetic items, leveling tends to be quicker, can pick any race/class combo without worrying about effectiveness really
---
Classic:
---
pros) highly populated, easy to learn for potential noobs/good to introduce yourself to classic mmo games, strangers like to group up
---
cons) leveling is slow, gold is slow to get [for a majority of people], walking/travel is slower, graphics are worse but this shouldn't effect your enjoyment
---
neutral) race has a pretty significant effect, which racials you have will be more or less useful to different classes/pick carefully
---
Let me know if I forgot anything.
---
Sounds to me like some needs to go change their diaper
---
You could create macros for it and bind the macros to a key.

F. e. your create a macro to /p oom and bind it to 1, /s oom to Shift-1 and so on
---
`Travelers backpack`
---
*Am I a joke to you?*
---
Fall behind of what? It's not a race. 
---
Think of it this way, the zones will be less crowded so questing will be easier, and you can send your new charc your money to get a head start not worrying about loot low level trash.
---
And you're druid isn't going anywhere, you can come back anytime.

I remember selling whelps for 30-50g, but at this point it's hard for people to pay that much for a vanity item because they want their mounts, it'd be more reasonable to expect around 25g or less. If you hold it maybe it can go up to 100g+, but I would wonder if you're still going to be playing at that point.
---
That‚Äôs not the point and you know it.
---
What did you bind release spirit to?
---
I thought I‚Äôd disabled my webcam üò©
---
Develop a greater appreciation for retail's warmode. I certainly did.
---
It's only on one character and the realm i play on (Shazzrah)
---
Maybe on your server, on mine low level mats are up for vendor prices. I'm better off vendoring them then putting them up, but that doesn't exactly make one rich.
---
I have 3 toons at lvl 10 because I can‚Äôt decide which to play lol
---
Need timestamps.
---
I just wasnt sure if it was a bug or maybe the visual effect of the pet wasnt added to the game at this point? If theres suppose to be a visual effect ill submit a bug report first thing when I get on tomorrow
---
no im not, but it seems others are looking back at the chain of replies. and yup. i mentioned boes generally. then when discussion went further i expanded further. thats how communication works lol
---
No lol
---
Just want to say, a week into classic and I‚Äôve got a lvl 20 priest, lvl 14 hunter, and lvl 14 shaman. I‚Äôve finally figured it out though. The priest sucks solo, so that‚Äôs my level with a friend class, and the hunter is amazing solo so that‚Äôs my solo. Maybe I‚Äôll go back to the shaman later.
---
It‚Äôs obvious you‚Äôre young. You‚Äôll realize as you get older that people who complain about the ‚Äúdouble standards‚Äù in race talk just want to play the victim.
---
So waiting the duration to kill them so you can quest is fair because waiting the duration to quest is unreasonable?
---
That skill literally got me into the game. I had a friend who was a 60 dwarf hunter in full t1. Watching him using it in the barrens, with his lvl 8 lion, getting lowbies to attack it so he could gank them was the most hilarious thing i had ever seen in a videogame. Bought the game that same day.
---
This method is Horde only though, isn't it?
---
Ah! Well congrats! Getting my mount at 40 was such a great feeling. With the mount, gold grinding is now even easier for us mages and you‚Äôll get your gold back pretty fast. Best of luck!
---
Depends on what you want to re-roll as.
---
It's much harder to re-roll on Classic WoW because the grind is so tough and less forgiving than retail. However, if time is on your side and you don't mind spending all that extra time leveling a toon you're more excited with, then it shouldn't be a problem.
---
You got your shit bashed by clothies again, didnt you?
---
Same with Shammies taking gear from warriors. I had a shammy just roll need and take silverlaines ring in sfk when I asked if I could have at the beginning of raid. He said " i thought u meant a different ring"
---
\^ Exactly.
---
Pointing out one's race doesn't mean you're being racist in any way, but in video game logic, even discussing it is. Doesn't matter if you mean anything by it or not, you'll get silenced regardless.
---
I didnt realize you guys had content in stonetalon
---
This is amazing
---
Exempt is such bullshit. I'm sorry to hear that dude. I honestly couldn't believe it was a thing when I came into the workforce. Just a way to work people harder for no pay. Hourly is such a better model
---
the fuck? i asked if it was BoE cause i dont remember. being from a boss doesnt matter. if its BoE they were all correct for needing it. if its BoP and none of them are even tailors then theyre assholes.
---
Yeah I think they removed a few last night which sucks, I really wanted to make some more gold before it happened. Atleast the world pvp should be come alot more interesting the more they remove
---
Oh man, that's one thing the community unfortunately has brought over from retail and private servers it seems. No actual effort in guild recruiting, just spam invites without anything. It's just rude.
---
Bet you he went to either YouTube or twitch instead üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Its just a summoning stone basically, people who said it ruined the game are a bit obnoxious.  
---
If you like to travel by foot all the way to a dungeon everytime that's fine. I love exploring too, but there's nothing wrong with summoning stones.
---
Lmfao @ his name
---
What server was this on?
---
Caucasianmale would also be reportable, though possibly not bannable, since Caucasian isn't derogatory.
---
News platforms are describing a person.  You're describing a type of person.
---
As some mage stands by 30 feet away who‚Äôs likely AFK watching you die
---
I would definitely wait. Any drop that's particular to a low-level zone is gonna be a lot more common for the next few weeks, until there are a lot of people comfortable at 60 who are too lazy to farm. I got the black kitten in Hillsbrad a few days ago and debated whether to sell it, but it was only going for like 30s on Sulfuras. But I also have two black cats IRL, so I decided to keep it. Figured it was a sign. But yeah, hold on to it and sell it later.
---
Tried adding both "" and \[\] without success. Do you know if macros are based on some known programming language or is it all in-house?
---
same thing happened to me
---
Its sunday for most of the world :D
---
*rogue charges with sprint, while spamming /y with something in Orcish, he's almost ther-*
---
*Entangle, another Faerie Fire*
---
Stay mad hunter!
---
I got my druid to 42 and i just rerolles to rogue. I like the class but not being able to proc on hit weapons sucks. Plus you cant cc indoors with roots which also suck. Those limitations are preventing me from having fun with the class. So rogue it is - already lvv 32 :)
---
You do what you have to do, Blizzard. We aren't going anywhere. We're ready to play when it's okay again
---
Use your head mate, people don't have surplus gold to spend in stuff unless it's mega cheap  in a couple months you'll get a good price because there will be alot more gold in the economy
---
Then correct me.  All you've done so far is shown that you use Tumblr and Reddit and don't know the difference between taking offense and giving offense.
---
did... did you post that on your alt yo post to reddit????
---
Mongoose*. You forgot the N, so that macro won't cast Mongoose Bite.
---
This entire server must to be purged
---
So would being mad that someone shut their video game off.
---
if you‚Äôre going to eat it, you‚Äôre not releasing it.
---
yea but then you're alliance
---
Add me to the list.
---
Are you fucking retarded?
---
You called me a twat who freaked out and left the group. The dungeon was done. There was no group to abandon you dumbshit.
---
I‚Äôve stopped spending now, but as soon as I get my mount, it‚Äôs back to spending heaps of gold on Armorsmithing mats.
---
Staves are two handed.
---
Really depends on the mob imo.
---
More like dorkshire
---
It's a high demand item for Warlock's and will be even into phase 2. It's a recipe you will use one time or a one time Sale for the other 4 members of the party. I fail to see how your need for your phase 1 BiS trumps their need to grind gold to level their professions/epic mount/training skills, etc. 
---
Now if this were a BoP Robe of the Void and not a BoE recipe in high demand I'd back you 300%. I just don't think it's fair to say they should pass so you get BiS. Krall Blade is pre-MC BiS combat sword rogue. Are you going to pass on that so he can realize his BiS dreams or you gonna roll and hope you win it so make some good Gold?
---
I was ganking a nelf in STV the other day and as she was running away from me she pulled off 7 god damned flips in a row.  I was so impressed I stopped chasing her.
---
This isn't a stave, it's an offhand.
---
Classic time paradox, the rogue will grow resentful due to being ganked and will gank in return.
---
I spent the first week leveling a hunter on one server and then decided I wanted to play another server and rerolled a priest on a different server and I‚Äôm now almost 40 on that (playing casually) so it‚Äôs not too bad!!
---
Same, kinda wanted to stay home and play but ended up working out in a screwed up way.
---
Other than me literally posting it in the text. 
---
How do you, any member of the public or any Blizzard employee know motivations behind the name to begin with? For all any of you know, I could be a black guy that‚Äôs so overly proud of being so, that I decided to broadcast it to the world through an avatar‚Äôs name. Not the most effective way of showing it, I know. But would that be such a bad thing?
---
But as someone said in another comment. It‚Äôs not how I see the name, it‚Äôs how the community does. 
---
Seeing as you‚Äôve mentioned my motivations behind the name in the first place. It was actually because I was watching a TikTok compilation on YouTube and as I was creating my character a guy said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a black dude‚Äù (taken out of context) but I thought it would be a funny name. To my friends and a lot of the community that saw it and had any kind of comment towards it was all positive and found it funny too. 
---
I‚Äôm fine with people having anonymity and reporting it if they find it offensive. I‚Äôm fine with me being banned for it is in fact offensive to them. But I‚Äôm just asking a simple question, as shown in the edit above.
---
That's /world
---
This is good advice, I agree with it - but until lvl 60 it's not really necessary.
---
5/5 Feral Instinct helps a lot, but I take Blood Frenzy over Primal Fury while leveling, so I'm not gimping my cat for, and never take thick hide. You won't be in Bear Form much outside of dungeons, so don't gimp yourself for questing, as it's not necessary.
---
If you want to tank raids though, yes, go Primal Fury. I still never take thick hide, it's not worth it unless you're literally just a Bear tank and never want to PvP or heal.
---
Usually when that happens the server thinks you are logged in when you aren't. Usually waiting a bit will make the server automatically kick you like you were afk.
---
I am not sure why it is *still* not letting you in.
---
I leveled ret and healed dungeons as ret until about 40 and decided to start focusing more on dungeons than questing so I respecced holy. Solo questing is a pain now but finding someone to partner with isn‚Äôt hard. I‚Äôm 45 now and really enjoying being holy
---
This is so nice. You almost never see posts from people who are just grateful and happy, it's usually when someone has something to bitch about. You're a good person for taking the time to thank him, and I really hope he sees this.
---
It‚Äôs never too late.  There will be people with multiple level 60‚Äôs before phase 5.  And I‚Äôm not talking about speed levellers.
---
trash company... hire some professionals and then charge money. its simple ddos not a rocket science
---
Demo shout is (was?) bugged or something. Did a ton more threat than expected.
---
ok i understand that now. i assumed it was the same as robe of the archmage which i believe is a random drop in LBRS. 
---
the point of rolling need on BoEs is to sell it on AH. god calm down.
---
Yeah the title is nonsense but mages can't dual wield swords and staves, was my point :p
---
ShadowFang Keep, and then Black Fathom Depths
---
Okay... really weird fix that worked:
---
I logged into retail WoW and then back into classic and now it works! :D
---
Wait but he‚Äôs already 60
---
It's as if Google doesn't exist I swear
---
That's your main now, it's the law
---
I think you missed the part where I said I didn't want to resize the whole UI. I did check out ElvUI and honestly, it's way overkill. Sure, it's a clean UI and it does look nice however, I'm really not interested in all of the other bells and whistles that it offers that you can't just disable.
---
For example, when you press Esc to view the Main Menu, I have no desire to customize that UI element. It's not necessary at all and as such, I consider an AddOn that does modify that to be bloat, for me personally.
---
Who hurt you!?
---
Lvl 50+
---
...oh. He must had his reasons.
---
Aggro builds everytime Renew heals the target, regardless of whether you are in or out of combat with that specific mob.  If say, you cast Renew on the tank, the tank engages a mob but then stops auto-attacking or doing anything, after a tick or two Renew will have built more threat and the mob will run towards you. Even if you are still out of combat (you will enter combat when the mob starts attacking you).
---
This is incredible
---
Lol at all the downvotes in this thread from all the salty players who can‚Äôt get their fix.

Scourge Invasion of Lordaeron [Colorized]

/S
---
I do not approve
---
I used to have a nelf male main and a nelf female alt (warrior and druid). I always had the feeling the female had more flips, she was also my record holder! (Can't remember the number from 13ish years ago)
---
I absolutely missed this point you've brung in. My other equations was also, how long would it be for this game starts to die out?
---
Am rogue can confirm
---
Then the mage uses a limited invuln potion and just sheeps the warrior and resets the fight and then we're back to the 30 second intercept CD vs the 15 second CD blink scenario. The mage wins.
---

Sexy goats are going to fall from the sky! There is a dragon under the ground... and its going to step on Storm wind! Orcs are going to invade a second time! Mother f\*\*king pandas man! They are messing with our minds!
---
There's no reason warriors should have exclusive rights to that ring. All melee classes would be using it into their 50s if they could get it. Druids, Rogues and Shamans (and Paladins?) have just as much right to that ring as Warriors. If you want it that much, run the instance many times. That's what other classes do.
---
If I'm just going to sell it, I greed. Simple as that.
---
Is this real or just mockup?
---
But you can use them individually. You'll just need to press the right modifier key for the right spell. If you have that macro on 1, you cast Arcane Shot by pressing 1, you cast Serpent Sting by pressing Shift 1, you cast Hunter's Mark by pressing Ctrl 1 and you cast Wing Clip by pressing Alt 1 (assuming you fix the spelling errors in the above mentioned macro). I'd also add #showtooltip Arcane Shot at the top, so you can see the cooldown of that spell.
---
In classic def cot so far but in retail I'd have to say return to karahzan
---
That's where we differ. When I feral tank I am a dungeon rat so it's Full bear talents for me.
---
Life. Life gave him a warning.
---
It was retail but a shaman kept killing me while I was leveling my rogue, even though I waved at him
---
After 2-3 deaths I followed him in stealth while he was killing an elite and proceeded to just stun him so the mob would kill him. I stayed at his corpse and waited till he thought he was alone and proceeded to kill the elite, and I stunned him again while laughing at him.
---
TL;DR rogues are assholes
---
Alt+F4
---
I really recommend taking that with a giant grain of salt. 
---
first of all, sweeping strikes doubles the bonuses you get from any attack. Crit, procs, damage, etc. 
---
But heroic strike is so bad that even doubling it is not good. If you want to sweeping strikes, Cleave is still better than heroic strike. As are mortal strike and overpower. If you can sweeping strikes, you should never heroic strike. heroic strike is just for single target.
---
This thing about critting... the reason it's not worth doing is because it doesn't work. At all. You cannot do this. 
---
This worked on private servers, but on classic, sitting causes you to take double damage, but DOES NOT activate any abilities that make things happen "when you get crit". no blood rage, no enrage, nothing. you just take double damage. Do not do this. It does nothing but make you take more damage.  
---
I do agree though, arms tanks better. you have more rage to spam sunders, and if you can spam enough sunders, tanking is easy. And sunder is worth using for both damage and threat even when solo, until you get mortal strike.
---
He's asking about level 60 content.
---
I don't care how you play the game, as long as you're having fun. But don't pretend like the meta exists because of pservers or even streamers. Pservers had nerfed dungeon exp so this was never a thing there. And streamers or no streamers, if you can hit 100k+ exp/hour in dungeon cleaves, people will be doing it.
---
It's not about what people say is the best, it's about the results.
---
Thanks :)
---
I had a similar situation happen to me today. I was level 26 camping this 24 NE hunter north of Astranar when suddenly a 40+ shadow priest came in and started camping me. Luckily I have suppression, and the priest can't heal in shadow form, so I was able to fear the priest long enough to kill the hunter before I died again. 
---
Y'know, some of these higher level Alliance players are such weenies. Don't they realize they're the ones who should be dying?
---
LOL this is completely false, all it did was allow you to summon members from your party.
---
You seriously got banned for that? For how long?
---
Have you tried Z-pearl?
---
As a Rogue I just disappear.
---
If the starting zones are not heavily populated it can take you less than 6 hrs to reach 15 if you are questing hard any class. If you are bored with Druid, tanks and healers are ALWAYS sought after for dungeons so once you hit 15,16 people will want heal for dungeons and tank so something to think about. If you want to be able to level alone and have a good time solo play a hunter,mage, warlock all good leveling solo great dps options and rly fun kits. I‚Äôve been a hunter main for 15 yrs. rolled mage for classic I absolutely love it once you are getting close to 30 you cc and kiting kit feels amazing. My alt is a hunter and for whatever reason I never get bored of it. I hear great things about warlocks but I have never tried.

To be fair I used to work as a chef about 10 years ago and switched to software development. At least now when I work weekends I get paid double my day rate. Which for one day is about a weeks pay that I used to get as a chef.

IT might be shit for working the occasional weekend but at least it pays well and the normal hours are a the usual 9-5pm. A lot of IT workers don't realise how good they have it.

Yo I thought I was the only one... I went to Hawaii September 1st and I‚Äôm here until the 15th.  My guy is sitting in orgrimmar partying it up
---
This is how I played through WoW the first time those many years ago.
---
By the time I hit 60 on my first character, I had explored damn near everything already.
---
It's nice to get some variance, and playing across multiple zones means it's easier to link up with guildmates / friends *plus* you get more exp overall *plus* you can really appreciate the size of the world *plus* you won't find yourself staring at the same region for too long. 
---
Also fun: Spend some time just running and grabbing flightpaths, even to areas that are higher level than you. Getting zones 5-10 levels higher already mapped out on flightpaths makes life so much easier, and running along roads (plus slow/stop abilities) makes it pretty easy to not die while doing so.

So you're going to pass on the flask recipes? Titanic Legging recipe? Core armor recipe? You're going to take a random person saying "Oh I have \*insert profession here\* so I am the obvious choice for that super lucrative recipe. Y'all do the right thing and greed."
---
I've seen at least 4 different profiles linked in twitter comments.
---
No. I don‚Äôt really know why, I just don‚Äôt find that the class fantasy resonates with me. I don‚Äôt like the HoT focused healing playstyle. I don‚Äôt value the versatility of being able to play every role. So it‚Äôs all entirely personal preference, but I don‚Äôt enjoy Druid.
---
I wish there was something I could give back in return...
---
When DM comes out we'll all be decked out already and bust through that place the same way we busted through everything else.
---
There are probably other addons that allow you this just as well or better.
---
I believe healbot would still show you this, even if you dont use the interface to make the heal. Would need to test it out though.
---
I don‚Äôt think a rogue needs a dagger with 8 int, some spirit and +spelldamage and healing...
---
Only hunters need that!
---
It may be worth pushing the Druid to 35. At that level you can max professions which will be very helpful for late game stuff. Never too late to start a new character
---
I know that they accept those things, but that's what drives me away. My point is that I don't dislike the idea of world PvP. I don't mind that someone might kill me anywhere, or that I need to be alert for danger. That part is fun to me. Griefing is not. It's just a shame that there's no way to experience the fun of world PvP without also throwing in griefing.

Ganking is more an Alliance thing - going after people at a lower level than oneself, preferably low on health as well. We of the Horde live by the words Strength and Honor.

If you do gank us however, of course we‚Äôll retaliate - and corpse camp you, and spit on your fucking grave. Especially if you‚Äôre a gnome. Scum of Azeroth.

White isn‚Äôt derogatory either. Nor black should be.
---
As said previously, I‚Äôm not a black male. But for all the community or Blizzard knows, I could be. In which case. I would be describing myself as black. Same would go if I named myself ‚ÄúWhitedude‚Äù. All I‚Äôm doing is changing the adjective ‚Äòmale‚Äô to ‚Äòdude‚Äô. Still describing one person.

Less layering is a win in my book, but I understand it was a necessary thing at release because the entire population was densely packed into early zones. Now that some time has passed and people are way more spread out I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre removing some layers and I think having more activity in the zones is a positive.   I don‚Äôt think they need to apologize if your leveling experience is a little tougher/longer
---
Wow, this really looks like the classic WoW experience I had 12 years ago. You remember extended maintenance just for your server with no ETA and no info on it?
---
Oh, I agree. And they‚Äôre just looking at the best interests of the community with as little headache as possible. 
---
But I‚Äôve gone a bit off track here...
---
My main question was to be ‚ÄúWould the outcome be the same if my name was ‚ÄúWhitedude‚Äù. 
---
Which I guess the answer would be ‚ÄúIf x amount of the community has an issue with the name, then that‚Äôs enough. People can‚Äôt get offended by the name, if it‚Äôs not there‚Äù
---
Either that or it's extreme priest roleplaying :)
---
Thanks for the reply man
---
Yep, good thing it's going away soon. They've already been lowering the amount of layers and it's showing.
---
I think they‚Äôre more just saying that they don‚Äôt come to Azeroth to bring the real world with them into the game

Is Deadmans hand not in Classic? Are you trolling ?

My gf has started WoW for the first time with a mate and I, who have been around since the early days. I suggested hunter, we went and tamed Bjarn and she loves her char. We carefully explained her gearing and when to roll need or greed and how to evaluate passing on gear for other classes if relevant.
---
Went and did a run and she won 6 greed rolls in a row. I'm glad Blizz managed to preserve the sheer fuckiness of vanilla hunters for Classic. If a hunter isn't pissing you off, you're just not playing the game right.
---
once i played warrior rogue, druid and another warrior jumps on me, i use my retalation and got some luck on crits... so derp allys saw what happns when you are meele and keep trying to hit warrior under retalation \^\_\^
---
I am also talking about experienced players. Most of the experienced players are behind the meta since people have learned a lot about the game since vanilla.

And again, no matter how experienced AoE mage group, you dont do SM armory in 2 pulls. When it comes to dungeons that are even worse for mages like BRD, ST or ZF they fall even further behind.
---
Because it‚Äôs just the controversial parts of politics being discussed to try and get a negative response from people, nobody is discussing fiscal policies or planned improvements to government infrastructure.
---
if you don't have enough spirit you need to stop and eat or bandage or what have you meanwhile with spirit you can just chain mob after mob as a warrior. so while a kill is slower the 2-3 secounds per mob kill is earned back and more when you don't need to stop.
---
the best part however is that there is a lot of gear in classic which has the normal ammount of stam and str for the level but extra free spirit ontop it that gear is just insane for warriors.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm sure we should give blizzard more money to make their service that we already pay for secure...
---
Every night I've seen some variation of "gnome orgies" or "gay gnome grouping" in general trade chat. Followed by someone saying gays were outlawed in classic.
---
Does sap aggro the guards in classic?
---
vanilla not much about 1v1 pvp. 
---
there is premaid vs premaid
---
but also. warrior, warlock and shammy top three pvp classes anywhere
---
And then world and lookingforgroup end up being the same thing.
---
Tbh go in interface - raid frames - use raidframes for party and show dispellable buffs only, and show missing health. ibwas using grid back in the day. And thebdefault one has same funcionality except its prettier

i feel they are lack of something even it is in a game, oh well, since you put it this way. I will try not to be nice, and start ganking
---
Rolled a rogue just for phase 2. The Zoomer tears shall be sweet
---
Then why not make fun of insecurity, a flaw in one's character, and not something irrelevant that can't be changed?
---
This is the main reason I won't be playing with most people I know IRL. They always roll on pvp servers and I have no interest in backstabbing other players or the corpse runs that come with dickheads who enjoy kicking sand in people's faces.
---
Thanks for the reply. As far as buying it I was thinking about it more as a longer term investment rather than having my own twink. Like you said prices are low because there is not much gold on the market but eventually I should be able to resell those items for way more? Do you agree?
---
It also seems like many of those boe‚Äôs are not that easily farmable due to low drop%. You might be better off grinding 50-100g somewhere else and buying an item than spending hours and hours grinding it with a small chance of obtaining one. Right now we have the most people running low lvl content that we will ever have on a realm, so there is good amount of twink items dropping, but I feel like that will change as soon as majority of player base turns to endgame.
---
Just because Blizzard isn't an indie company doesn't mean they're bad people.

With that said, I'm going to engage in some "educated" speculation, based on the mechanics and lots of experience using seal twisting on Emerald Dream. I believe it should work like so:
---
Command into Righteousness -&gt; Nothing happens. This is to be expected, as SoR doesn't proc off of Crusader Strike in BC either. It's an ability that strictly procs off of white hits (until a later change, which was reflected in the tooltip). 
---
Command into Crusader -&gt; Increased AP for the SoC hit. On Emerald Dream, this would give you a noticeable, but not massive, damage increase. I can't tell if this is the case on current classic, because the reduced damage of each hit may be a factor. 
---
Command into Light, Wisdom -&gt; You will get the seal effect proc from light or wisdom. With a slow enough weapon, I believe this is guaranteed.
---
Command into Justice -&gt; You will get the seal effect proc stun. Note that this may not proc even if twisted correctly.
---
Yea sure lemme give more money apart from paying a monthly sub to a multi-billion company... dafuqs wrong with you
---
They have already said that each layer holds as many players as an original vanilla server, so this is false.
---
On kill.   Its very easy to test that.   If a green+ drops in a party anyone will be able to start the looting process to get the rolls going.   If it generated on loot it wouldn't be available for anyone to loot.
---
I was on discord with a friend and he remarked that it rained. I went on for a good while about memories of when the weather effects were introduced to the game. He started laughing because he meant rain IRL.
---
lmao i loved it when a lvl 50 killed my lvl 22.. posted it in general and every player wanted to help me camp the guy (we went 10+ lvl 20-30 on his ass). Took us 40minutes for him to log off, totally worth my time.
---
I'm using grid2. What's broken?

you just dont know how to play warrior. its kinda hard xD

New to Vanilla, Started in late-wrath, I stepped into my first raid, in around early cata after the level cap was raised. I have never experienced this side of the game, and I' truly inlove. I spent more time with these group of strangers, and had the time of my life. Much love and respect to the men and women who brought me along!
---
That‚Äôs how wow works in retail at least. I mean that‚Äôs kinda how most mmo games work nowadays. If you don‚Äôt have the cutting edge achievement, you can‚Äôt join a normals group.

Ohhh that explains why yojamba had a wait time this morning, I thought it was from server transfers.
---
Do it for quests perhaps. That's what I'm going to do. Have picked up 4 quests for it so far, will run it once and no more. I'll go SM until 44, almost 45, then ding 45 in Uldaman and then go ZF.
---
I guess most people are a "greedy PoS'" then.

A DDoS-attack can happen to anybody. Instead of blaming Blizzard we should help them, it's better for everyone and can prove that companies and their fans can have a good relationship.

Threat isn't a value that's given in the combat log, is it?
---
I guess it would tell you what abilities each person uses, but it doesn't take into account ranks though, does it?
---
For damage, the exact value is stated in the combat log for each hit, so it's easy to pull damage numbers.

Would you rather let the attackers go free? You think Blizzard deserved what happened?

I have a Lv23 priest but the server im in was lacking tanks so i decided to park my priest for a bit and finally got my Warrior to Lv23 today. Now when someone LF priest or tank for Deadmines run i can choose whichever the group needs and run with it. I plan to level them both on similar level so that i have 2 choices for instance runs. I know im gonna hit 60 much slower than others but i do enjoy healing or tanking so i will take my sweet ass time getting to end game but enkoy a whole lot out of the game.

Prepatch would have meant you had the TBC talents.

"The controversial parts of politics" What, like that racism might be good? That bullying might be good? That hate and fake news and propoganda might be good? What's conroversial about this stuff? Cause this is exactly the stuff people claim is controversial. That abortion might be worse than the holocaust? These aren't controversial issues, these are black and white good vs evil issues that the worst kinds of people are trying to convicne everyone are just matters of opinion and controversial. But they shouldn't be. Giving money to the rich while the poor suffer and starve isn't controversial. It's wrong. Those are the things I get called out for when discussing. But when people bring their conservative hate and bullying and ignorance and intolerance to the game which leads me to call them out, it's not them that get attacked for their politics, it's me that gets attacked for mine.

I don't mean to go off at you, that's just where I'm coming from. Because I've heard a hundred times "I'm reporting you for bringing politics into general chat."

I was hoping to learn about shaman PvP- and the best specs to go if I‚Äôm interested in world pvp while leveling, I‚Äôm currently enhc because I read it was best for leveling as shaman and I‚Äôm looking to put some point into ele later levels (29 atm) also I‚Äôm using 2h rock biter with the staff from bfd - in PvP is windfury better or rockbiter for more constant damage? Also - any suggestions on weapon upgrades I should keep an eye out for in upcoming dungeons?

you guys know vanilla wasnt desired because of the content itself? its ironic that you guys clearly have envy of these players because it seems youre playing the game to "complete it" and move on, which is probably not the case for the people already geared at 60. i know this is difficult to understand and sounds contradictory. but please understand that these players that youre envious of are not bored.

Enhance really is the way to level in my experience - elemental shamans spend a lot of mana, so if you're more depending on your spells rather than melee swings dealing your damage, you will need to spend a lot of time drinking. 
---
You can easily heal dungeons as an enhancement shaman, which would provide you a good opportunity to need on more resto oriented gear. Once you hit lvl 55 you might consider changing to resto so that you can heal instances and gear up during the last few levels. 
---
But you can of course do whatever you want to do, noone is forcing you to play the most efficient way - if elemental is more fun to you, then you should do that.
---
Some priest killed me while i was fighting two tigers. Bumped into him later. Guess who got corse camped?

Nah, boomers aren't technically illiterate, and zoomers are the ones glued to their phones.

Did I break a rule. Oh. I see what you're saying. Okay I apologize. I just. I care. I'm sorry.
---
Dude, druids don't survive as long with BA and end up dying unctrolled and cleave into the raid, that's the ACTUAL problem.
---
Also I can tell you've NEVER EVER done vael because you don't know that you literally can overtake a druid on threat just by merely existing for 2/3rds of the fight as a warrior with literally only one button.
---
Alt-f4 or just accept the death. There isn‚Äôt really anything you can do. Top rogue PvPers across private servers agree you just lose to shadow priests, it‚Äôs a hard counter.

Yes, lets throw money at them and hope they fix it.

No idea what is with all of the horde boomer shit. Half of us boomers were alliance as well.

Raiding the crossroads in the barrens was such a good time.

*sips monster energy drink*

Played horde last 6-7 years on pservers (had maybe 1 alliance alt char) and now I feel like I'm playing completely new game on alliance. I'm also taking it bit slow for the first time, reading every quest, doing every dungeon, all proffesions artisan etc.
---
It's weird, 42 levels in and I really don't miss horde, and killing orcs is super fun. :3
---
True, but Blizzard have seemed a little more disorganized then most when it comes to storyline execution in recent years. There are others who are far bigger lore buffs than myself, but reading about the contradictions or unexplained twists do seem to indicate they have started coming up with story plots a little more suddenly
---
God if only they didn‚Äôt taste like complete ass (and this were real) I might enjoy it.

Fall behind on word first 60 or ragnaros?

Take your time, classic is here to stay.

We don't want you, our servers are full and crash on their own as it is.

Please form an orderly queue back to your own region before we deploy the drop bears.

There are wierd  ppl on classic... yesterday i was kicked bc i "need" on 1h mace which no one wanted. Their reason... I ninja bc enha use only 2h.
---
I don't blame them, honestly. I don't even take hunters into groups anymore, because every fucking time they pull half the instance with their stupid Echeyakee. It's just easier to just take other classes

What this guy said. I only ever need if I actually can use the item because it's an upgrade for me.

Same. Satisfying to gank those, I like to think it's the same people who boast that horde is what you choose if you aren't a scrub in PvP.
---
I agree, how does the *$15 a month I have been paying for years sound*.
---
Second that.
---
Nah it‚Äôs my server too. I think the video is hilarious but it‚Äôs actually the reverse as far as boomers and zoomers:
---
Folks that were children back in 2004 picked Alliance so they missed out on the hardcore, small community aspect of the Horde faction. Naturally they would want that now so they spam Horde. Horde is actually full of zoomer PvP sweaties as well as Monster-sippers. Very unga. Very Zerg.
---
Alliance tends to have older folks wishing to experience something new. A lot of them rolled Horde back in the day. The guilds on my server seem a little more organized as far as PvP is concerned and they have a lot of knowledge about tactics. Less unga.
---
This is all anecdotal of course.
---
Go back to retail.
---
Same and bur for alliance lol
---
/r/iamverysmart
---
the player equipping it doesn't change the items value.  the items value is the same to everyone it can be sold for X.  if the player who can equip it wants the item so much they can buy it for X.  Why illogically favor what you can "use" when dealing with boes?
---
Ive gotten to the point where i just tell the warrior DPS ¬¥that if youre not going to stop pulling aggro for no fucking reason at all from the tank, im just going to stop healing you. You¬¥re making me go oom every single pack, since I pretty much have at least 3 people taking damage solely because of you.

Apparently that‚Äôs accurate according to some CS teachers and tutors I‚Äôve spoken to.

Yeah after this happened I just dropped group and logged. I was 2 bars away from 40, the plate belt dropped, then he needs/wins roll over me. Just fucking called it a night

I think most of this can actually be done from the Interface Options menu

Not a lvl 60 tho
---
I'm actually studying the math for this right now, I'm not that good at explaining though.
---
First we have to know how many ways you can choose 3 numbers out of 100. That's calculated by taking the amount of possible choices n (100) and taking how many numbers we want k (3). The (algorithm?) is as follows 
---
n!/(k!(n-k)!) and in our case 100!/(3!(100-3)!)=161700
---
Now we know the amount of possible ways to choose 3 numbers out of 100 and since there is only one way to choose (55, 56, 57) we just divide 1 by 161700.
---
1/161700 **‚âà** 0.00000618 or .000618% chance.
---
Same, I've buffed so many druids but rarely get buffed back... ):

Any links please?

You're not wrong!
---
You must be a riot in groups
---
you pay that to play the game, not to help blizzard. That's like saying you helped the restaurant that was burned to the ground just because you bought a burger there once
---
You are making progress. One day at time.
---
That's arguably not true; it just depends on your own skill and the overall performance of your group. I have gone full shadow and have had absolutely zero issues healing any dungeons up to ST so far. If someone's bad at healing they might need to compensate by going a bit into the holy/disc trees, but if you know what you're doing there's absolutely no need for that until you hit 55+ and start doing actual endgame content.
---
How? i installed it and tried, but it only seems to track your cooldowns, couldnt find anything about tracking DoT timers.
---
oh look can't argue. not a single person has ever disputed my boe logic.  it's indisputable it's 100% fair and every system other than needing boes isn't.
---
You dare?
---
This. There's no reason to be confused by adding addons for a new player. The modern WoW client frames are perfectly adequate.
---
so if beaststalker bracers would drop, and there‚Äôs a hunter in the group, you would roll need?
---
I had low lvl pvped back in the day. It was one off the major reasons why it took me almost 3 month to reach 60. There is a reason 90% rolled rogue twinks. Those ate the best to two shot people.
---
Because there are things he WANTS.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt center of the screen be on the gap? So your character would be split in two.. Doesn‚Äôt seem like a good solution for wow.
---
Hope not.

I had an orc rogue at 19 in vanilla, was good fun.

And they all went down???

you must be unable to think with an ounce of logic.  you're clinging to an unfair and pointless tradition.  you're like racists that won't accept it's not the 60s anymore.
---
7/10 - you missed the "End" key being Execute LUL
---
You think you want it, but you don‚Äôt.
---
already did the driver thing :D and it's not really tabbing because classic doesn't have the old school fullscreen
---
so basically what youre saying is other ppl's opinion is wrong and your opinion is right
---
Haven't had the chance to find out. Not playing a rogue.
---
Allways played as an Alliance, but am playing Horde in Classic. It feels like a new game and am glad that I did!
---
This is what I hate in current wow and classic that borderless is the only option. I like fullscreen.
---
Dont be sorry, his narcissistic ninja ass isnt sorry when he nabs something someone is actually gonna equip on spot,i hope he has the worst rng luck ever until he and his kind quit gaming altogether.
---
I'm sorry you didn't know that there are certain bosses you want to avoid as a druid, would it make you feel better to know you're fine tanking adds and pretty much just want to stear clear of most of bwl?

This was actually fairly helpful. Thanks

You wont see a troll warrior, ever. Not when orcs, tauren, and undead have way better racials. The only class that trolls really play is priest because of class/race specific spells. Mage/rogue gets taken by undead and hunter/shaman gets taken by orc. 
---
You wont see a tauren hunter. It doesnt have good racials for the class compared to orc hunters. And warrior, shaman, or druid seem more fitting. 
---
Every class and race gets played by orc and undead. All is desired. 
---
Gnome warrior is also not a thing. Alliance lack warlocks and rogues because of undead and orcs. 
---
Thing is you see a lot of is gnome mages, female nelf hunters, undead rogues, and orc shamans
---
Whenever I play Pokemon I need 3 save spots, one for my Charmander, one for my Squirtle, and one for my second Charmander.

---
I've heard Enhancement is the best for leveling. Though from my experience, it does get a bit dull, as it's mostly 'cast buffs, autoattack until dead'. Just some buffs take the form of a totem. 
---
If the intent is to heal, you'll probably have a more seamless transition to endgame, with Ele as they share needed stats more! 
---
For maximum efficiency, Enh. For more interaction, Ele. Nothing is stopping you from dropping the odd talent point into Resto as you level, anyway. 
---
Just be warned, Shaman drains mana superquick, so with Ele and Resto, you'd need a lot more water.
---
That's because you're the same level as the majority of the players and they're all finding the same stuff. You have to be ahead of the pack getting the stuff people havent really sold yet or behind getting stuff they no longer farm.
---
I‚Äôve made decent gold off AH but not as much as I‚Äôm used to
---
Blizzard/Activision doesn't need money. Candy Crush saga alone pulls like 1bil a day.
---
I just find it weird that out of 36 games installed just this version of the client exhibits these issues.
---
of course it's a boe it has X value.  That value is the same for every member of the party it isn't more valuable to the hunter.   If the hunter wants it he has an equal chance at winning it if he loses he can buy it from the winner or off the AH or do whatever he wants but every member of the party had the same chance at that value.  Lets say I need it, sell it, and buy myself an equally good piece of BOE.  why is that unfair?   a boe dropped all 5 players had a chance at it's value I won sold it and bought myself a piece of loot.  If the hunter wins it he cuts out a step thats it.
---
It really is that bad. Or else everyone would be playing retail and not classic.
---
I play a hunter and around level 24 I stupidly thought to myself "I'm not having much fun with hunter". But I was having a tough time during that level fighting average mobs at level 26+ and dying to horde a lot
---
Fast forward to level 36 and I am absolutely loving the class, like I always did. 
---
So it is possible to think you're not having fun

Theres a lot of really good 1 handers in the sub 40 levels. If you have two good ones go for it. As an added bonus more weapon swings = more enemy dodges = more overpowered crits.
---
It will fall off eventually. It definitely falls off when you get whirlwind axe.

Maybe you can check out if some addons make problems or run in repair in the blizzard app.
---
Back in the day when we had cancer raid frames that took up100% of screen well then grid was a lifesaver , but yhis one requires no maintanance and just few tickboxes

37 shaman right now, leveling Enhancement. I never had problems healing in dungeons. I keep a set of healing gear in my bank wich is needed at a certain level, but no resto spec. Somewhere around 40-45 i intend to respec to elemental, putting every point past 40 in resto. This should be enough for five man dungeons (maybe switching elemental mastery for natures swiftness at 60).
---
Nope, there is absolutely no way of getting to 40 and having 100g without selling anything on the AH.
---
I played Horde in vanilla up until end of Cata, then switched to Alliance to play with friends. Horde again in Classic and it feels great, though the only reason I went Horde again was because wolves are the coolest mounts in classic and Horde PvP armour looks so much better.
---
I've played since classic vanilla and my son just told me this yesterday. I'm actually feeling better that I wasn't the only one!
---
Funnily enough, i started logging off at the Inn again in BFA. The 110-120 is so fucking atrocious that you want all the bonuses you can get.

even then, chances are they already have a mage

If your question is how can a story of many years ago be predicting our current climate? I would argue that history repeats itself. Again and again and again and aagain. And this current climate has started brewing since the 70s. But I've been made aware of rule 5 on this subreddit, so I shall contain my rants for now and the future. I apologize. But yeah, If I see shitty things going on in general chat, I'm gonna stand up for what I believe in. Whether everyone is against me or not. And if that makes me a sheep as they claim it does... ah well. Polymorph me then, if that's what you believe :p
---
No clue how I‚Äôve done it multiple times now but ok
---
Afaik some rare shit drops and someone says "everyone need on that shit! gl" and everyone rolls need. I don't care if I don't get the thing, that's how it always was
---
Almost makes me regret about rolling Alliance
---
I was at home rootin me misses when bruce called

You can do the same with a warlock and the felhunter pet (or if warlocks still have detect stealth as a buff in TBC, I can't remember).
---
EIther way humans gets a massive buff in WotlK with a new racial(free pvp trinket) in an attempt to balance out the factions.
---
Max 1g at this time. What were you expecting?
---
that's only in the hardcore community, not for first timers  (see topic title)
---
Do major cities give more rested xp? I'm starting to feel that way
---
ally boomers will avenge our zoomer friends... after we put the kids to bed.
---
why arbitrarily apply it to items of a certain rarity?  that only makes an environment where ninjas can thrive as people assign value differently.  half the group insta rolls greed because they deem an items value low and half the group wants to roll need because they deem it high.  whats the point of this?  this only favors ninjas and unfair practices.
---
Everyone rolling need on all boes is 100% fair
---
Yeah I've no clue how you've "done" it either.
---
If thats the route they are taking then they should go for every expansion of teh game, as I have no interest in TBC and Wrath (because they are shit) and would rather play MoP over those two.
---
As a rogue, this is fair. I will atleast try and kill you.
---
More than half back then
---
do you use the mace? cause if you dont youre an asshole.
---
Fishing 225, Currently im lvl 34 so I can't go further till lvl 40. My route is just a simple two way run across the coast of Stranglethorn vale.
---
And animal penises
---
it would be ok.  another advantage is that you both need completely different gear , so instead of being eachothers rival when a mage item drops, you will have double chances on something nice
---
My buddy found two 16 slotters that way.
---
This gif is so warrior it hurts.
---
My bad, was back and forth in the comments. The bottomless bag is a different beast :)
---
Hey man! Love your video! What‚Äôs the rock song‚Äòs name? Keep up the good work!
---
no you can't do the same it's not even fucking close and the fact that you're even pretending that it is shows a stunning lack of understanding.
---
Ah ok i forgot the Autoinvite .....
---
Shadowedunitframes is really good.

" I Am Iron Judgment! "

Nice mount! I‚Äôve always wanted that one

Did you just.. "you think you do, but you don't" the TBC people? Bruh..
---
I met a dwarf mage called Ankleblaster. It was perfect.
---
That happens when you flight United instead of Delta

Gotta say, getting those tusks was a trial of the soul.

Those drop rates.

STV being 90% horde pop and being ganked every 5 minutes.

Don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôve just been making terrible decisions and not logging off.

Hahaha dude I use an identical setup (minus the cat). Good to see I‚Äôm not alone.
---
Your answer helped me so much. Thank you
---
My gift as a warlock? I don‚Äôt fear their mobs when they tag-snipe before my dots tick off
---
It‚Äôs only like a level and a half of double do maximum isn‚Äôt it?
---
Did you have to activate a setting to enable that?
---
White is a blacklisted word according to a post from earlier today they consider the name ‚Äúwhite‚Äù hate speech.
---
but no one wants loot to be fair. We want loot to be used or greed on.
---
well good luck waiting the 5 years or whatever it would take for them to get to that point
---
No and no it wasn't.   We rolled need on Flask Recipe back in 2005  among strangers.
---
In guild and friends runs it gets passed to the actual alchemist obviously.  please note carefully I am ONLY talking about random pugs when discussing the 'all need on jackpot items' method.
---
I dont see any hunters buying this, which leaves it to sham-... Oh wait..
---
Should have deleted with execute imho.
---
Weird huh. Guess not all are that careful with money
---
Not having an enchant on weapon doesn't make you unviable
---
Look for mobs that have good vendor trash. Someone in another thread linked this. I can attest to the lashtail raptors around the STV arena, especially if you have skinning
---

It's in alliance territory but its possible for horde to enter if they get there. I'm not sure how common it is for horde players to do deadmines
---
Is there an add-on that fills the same function as outfitter? Doesn't seem like that one is getting backported to classic and having to use macros to manage my healing/DPS gear is driving me crazy.
---
You're kind of a dumb shit, arent you?
---
I had a hunch that it would change once I'm lvl 60. But then again, I kinda understand. There's little use in grinding for gear when you're still leveling since it will become irrelevant once you gain a few levels. But we'll cross that bridge when we get there. Right now, I'm on an adventure everytime I log in (and wait for the queue to be over with) and I'm loving every minute of it.
---
One of my friends used to play pretty hardcore, and he told me "dude, this time it's not about the endgame, it's about the journey" and he's completely right.
---
While i'm sure there are people who roll on gear that isn't actually good for them, it amazes me so far how ***little*** people understand about what is good gear for each class and what stats are viable.
---
The amount of times I have seen someone rage about a hunter rolling need on a BiS item for the hunter telling them that it's not hunter gear just blows my mind. As well as the amount of people that think gear works like retail where you only roll on gear that is the highest armor type you can equip.
---
Go to Duskwood or Wetlands it‚Äôs like The Barrens Lite
---
No... warriors have already a class version of a fear trinket. No point to have an extra when you can get a passive stun resist. Plus axe specialization.
---
First time playing wow, watched streams for years. I like/dislike the fact that are several zones where i can quest. I'm level 21 ne hunter and currently in redridge. It's hard to figure where to go next. Wetlands? Back to Ashenvale? I would love Duskwood because I know it's an iconic area but at what level should I go there? Also boar or cat for better aggro? Or even a wolf? There are so many things about wow i have to learn damn
---
i played 2 tbc pservers and honestly i still think it's the better game. should have faction based queues though that's the only way to make it playable
---
Wait a minute.
---
It's MankRik?
---
I've been calling him Mankirk!Why didn't anyone tell me? Oh god I've been making an idiot out of myself!
---
It happens, when I started playing I didn't bother to lookup anything and rolled need on anything that looked useful.. agility, int, stam, spirit, it was all useful :) .
---
the thing is, a hunter going melee build will still be able to do high damages with his bow if he is stuck in a frost nova
---
yeah arguing against fairness you're totally on the right side of this one dude LOL
---
Inequality wooo!
---
these are so cool, love the undead focus as me and my gf both rolled undead rogues... https://www.instagram.com/p/B10MoEFCiQN/?igshid=1a6n4wwje05fm hope your art gets more traction !

I was kidding btw. It isn't real lol. Now I feel like an asshole
---
HOARDER!
---
What about detect invisibility! Or you could be really nice and invite them and soulstone them
---
What were you selling to get the gold you needed?
---
Im in that guild ghehe
---
Iam using the macro from watchmysixx from the hunter discord. Its working okayish..but not 100%. The time between pressing feign death and actually getting out of combat to lay a trap feels off.. its a bit to long imho. 
---
Hopefully blizz will fix this issue..
---
You must never get down
---
Engineers need leather and cloth! They will buy it.
---
What am I looking for here in this image?
---
dinged 40 with 20 gold more than necessary and didnt use the ah, and even when i tried shit wasnt selling. The ah is awfull to make money compared to vendor
---
If I'm honoured with my city, will my mount cost 100, 90 or 80g all together with the training? 
---
And at 60, how much is it then, if I'm honoured/revered? Thanks!
---
The Hunter version of this is; as you are running by people who are fighting mobs just toss out a Sting and send your pet to attack their target. You can just resummon your pet when you get out of range. You just made that mob really easy for them and it costs you nothing.
---
For the sake of your argument, lets say humans are good (although they are massively buffed in wotlk). So what? Horde still outclass the rest of the races, even the blood elf racials is really good for PvP.
---
Horde absolutely dominates TBC
---
I believe that everything is maxed (10) more or less, with AA and the other advanced settings turned on as well. Still get 144+ FPS, so why not :-)?
---
If you just subscribed, I believe it takes a couple hours for it to fully process so you're stuck in starter edition limbo for a bit
---
I don't know why everyone assumed the auction house is just fucked and worth ignoring. I've made so much gold off of it. Everyone tells you to vendor leather, etc but it's a fucking goldmine on the AH. I've been selling medium leather for 1s/each, heavy for 3.99-5.99/each, tiger meat for 5.99/each, rator meat, etc, etc
---
Suddenly your 30s stack of heavy is worth 1g np.
---
Any normal way you would target a public server. Denial of service covers a very broad range of attacks. The guy probably targeted the outermost router that was associated with blizzard because it's the most vulnerable to network traffic while causing the largest effect.
---
It's also possible that he was targeting specific game servers, but due to the nature of a DDOS, the ISP's router failed to pass all the traffic and started failing.
---
I had to log out. And log back in 3 or 4 times but it finally worked.

---
Three versions of faster cat speed exist. Feral Swiftness is the talent everyone is mentioning that you can get as early as level 21. Travel form is also a cat form and you get that at level 30. Regular cat form also has a dash skill that boosts speed temporarily and you get that at level 26.
---
Anger is a path to the dark side my friend. Anger leads to more anger which in turn leads to endless suffering. Killing younglings will neither bring balance to you nor to the galaxy. Always keep that in mind.

Do you know where it can be downloaded for classic?

Yikes! He was 38 years old ?! And DDOS attacked the game over raid drama? Your mind must be really fucked up if you commit a crime for such a stupid reason at 38.

Damn this was intense! While i was reading that I felt you man..
---
Hope to hear from you again and with an adventure in azeroth!

He‚Äôs king of Stormwind, not of the Alliance. There was no singular High King until Varian in Cataclysm, but if there were a central leader in vanilla, it was Magni.

With that out of the way now you can focus on the important stuff, GEARING UP!! CZ
---
Yeh I just subscribed. Thanks for help!
---
I take it you haven't played much on both factions. Horde aren't any better for ganking.
---
When I leveled barrens chat on Noggenfogger was an endless cycle of people saying "noggers" and people being offended by them.
---
Had to do a double take, our guild has the same name
---
Exactly. Breaks my heart when sub 40s beg for money to buy new shit from AH. That +2 str is sure nice but not worth anything when it comes to gameplay. Obviously you should play like you like - not saying theres a wrong way to play - but getting a mount at 40 is such an important milestone that people probably should make long-term plans rather than going for level 26bis from AH
---
What class are you?
---
Didn't work when I tried it, seemed to just make up the values and didn't add any values for anyone else. So it would say had 950 threat and everyone else would have 0
---
Thanks for the reply! I didn't research what they did and didn't do, I was just excited to play vanilla again.
---
Level 15 here thanks! This gives me a plan
---
Yeah! It's a Great British Baking Burn!
---
No one loves my underwater breathing
---
PvE server i suppose :)
---
Wait, wouldn't they have server teams on site around the clock anyway?
---
&gt; I've got Str &gt; Stam &gt; Spirit &gt; Int &gt; Agi right now, mostly as circumstance as what drops. My friends, and some talk online, says maybe I should quest/grind/instance for items to be more Str &gt; Agi &gt; Stam / Int / Spirit. Additionally, I've been rocking the 2h windfury combo, but I've also heard 1h and a shield with flametongue is good, or elemental past 40 is good.
---
Go agi&gt;stam&gt;str&gt;spi. make sure to have LB and FlameShock active as much as possible and have searing totem out. 
---
If you pass by a druid/priest make a macro to say: can i have thorns/stam buff plz?
---
Last resort is to get into a spell/melee cleave group.

---
He meant he hopes he is prepared at 61
---
I think arenas, new raids and new battlegrounds were super cool in wotlk. However dalaran was a boring dual faction main city, and flying mounts should not have been added. Furthermore it was a bit sad that adding Outlands and northrend effectively made original map abandoned for max levels. If they were to add more content in classic to avoid stagnation, i think including new areas but keeping the level cap would be nice
---
Ok so I don‚Äôt play WoW but I‚Äôm planning on getting into it soon. May I ask what has been happening in WoW recently?
---
Also if you wouldn‚Äôt mind, How has your day been?
---
/say a c ‚Äö c √á√à ‚Äö f 30
---
How are blizzard servers still vulnerable to this?  Why has the internet not collapsed yet?
---
No it‚Äôs because you just poked me and now I‚Äôm going to murder you
---
Yeah I read what you posted. I just disagree. Unlike when TBC was released in retail you now have the choice to stay in classic. If it is your opinion that TBC sucks then you do not need to play it. I just think it is silly to tell other folks not to want what they do because YOU don't like it.
---
No chocolate ice cream will be available to anybody ever because my opinion is the only one that matters and I only like vanilla. Chocolate leads to strawberry, and what next?? Mint fucking chip? Outrageous! This is what you sound like.
---
What kind of low life loser would literally ruin the fun for everyone looking forward to this?
---
There‚Äôs people that are setting time aside this weekend just to play in this fantasy world and some low life goes and DDOS the game? That‚Äôs fucked up. 
---
Why do you hate happiness?
---
Time to kill some boars
---
Scrap
---
Wait til you get aspect of the pack AND a mount. Not because of the 60%,but because if you're doing quests with PUGs then you get a free taxi from putting on Pack and following a slow class
---
A lot of people consider TBC the highlight of wow. Why do you feel the need to shit on their most favorite expansion? You got classic and you will most likely have it once TBC comes out. Why worry about something that will most likely not happen for the next two years. Are you this pathetic that you want to keep playing this game forever, unchanged?
---
I try to do this, but if I‚Äôm in the middle of questing and need to log off, sometimes I‚Äôll save myself the walk back to where I am and just log out in a safe spot near where I am. 
---
Time is money friend!

Why 23?

Nope, pvp.

Love the murlocks

When Vol Jin told me to get him so cloth when my name was clearly &lt;xxx The Light of Dawn&gt;
---

---
Anger management in arms alone makes fury a bad spec for tanking while leveling.
---
They might be metaphorical but in the end you still don't have to think about it and it's just horde and alliance fighting. Games are a form of escapism and I hate it how games are now criticized for not making political statements and they have to have forced inclusion.
---
&gt; There are a ton of classic guides centered around what class is relevant and good. At the end of the day, there are 40 spots for raid, ret is 'one of' the worst classes to bring, but they do have niche uses. As a paladin you will most likely end up healing even if you're specced into ret, but get the nightfall axe and tell your raid leader you'll keep it up and you can probably get a spot in the raid no problem.
---
By no mean does OP seem like a guy going for world first, this min-max doesn't seem necessary. Remember this is Classic easy not just pserver easy.
---
We can deny them the enjoymnt of ruining our mood, though. We can always just say that today we aren't going to be playing. Just go outside and do something for another hobby and have fun despite this disphit.
---
Glad you‚Äôre enjoying it! I‚Äôm so torn.. I was going horde for classic, but I‚Äôve been on holiday since launch, my friends have started on alliance... I‚Äôm gonna make a character to play with them on alliance, but it doesn‚Äôt feel 100% right, I was so set on my troll hunter..

Why buy anything. Literally nothing is good because you level fast anyway. Do all dungeons Atleast once and quest. All the rewards or drops are more then enough. I have a 33 rogue, 6 blue items and 40g just from playing. Between 35-40 you make the rest for a mount. Always works

Any excuse

I said what do you expect from people who live in twig huts?

Thanks for the info!

Will give it a go :)

I think I'll take the cash, tbh.
---
Not OP, but I have the same problem and my laptop can get too hot to for prolonged contact. How bad is it? (HP Spectre laptop)
---
I admire your naivety
---
SM spans like 8-10 levels..do some research about your class pieces,and youll know what wings to run.
---
As a priest I buff the hunters pet with Fort not the hunter, it‚Äôs much more useful  ;)
---
&gt; The mentality though is that if it's not optimal/ideal then it's not worth taking.
---
which is sad considering how much easier to game is turning out to be
---
the one where they added hypothermia.  what a completely arbitrary, ineffective, and honestly just confusing nerf. iceblocking twice in 30 seconds was never "OP" and the nerf barely did anything except lower the mage skillcap.  if you were iceblocking that fast you must be doing something sick or you've just wasted your best defensives.  if mages were too strong hypothermia wasn't the answer it made no sense and afaik it's never been removed.  fuck you blizzard.
---
I have a dual core, and both are around 50C while running WoW and other shit like a few tabs and discord. I'll look at it the next time my FPS drops and see if it changes
---
What the hell!
---
No he will have left the group by then. Thats what he does with his money.
---
Also lets be real you wont upgrade shit with money except one decent piece max. boe are pretty whatever compared to normal lot anyways.you guys just want money for your points just say it.
---
Especially true after 40 as hunter. Mail with +4 agi and +4str, or leather with +8 agi? I'm going for the leather
---
Comes down to you. Most people would keep the 11 spirit i reckon. Modern levelling meta is to use spirit regen a lot and wand a lot. Int doesn't actually do a whole lot for you as a warlock.
---
I'm a 33 priest, I haven't bought anything from the AH, I haven't learned like 8 spells that I probably should, and I have 17 gold. The only thing I spend money on is drinks. What the fuck.
---
mounts*
---
Threatplate works well for the purpose of tanking
---
Truthfully I have no idea, I do hope so. 
---
Will make me feel better.
---
THE DWARF ON THE WALL!!!
---
Gy is for 30+
---
Lib is for 32+
---
Arm is for 34+
---
Cath is 36+
---
Im talking about the bare minimum and personally would go arm with 35 and cath with 38.
---
Technically gy can be extremely important.
---
As caster (esp. Priest and warlock) you get a good off hand that you can combine with the dagger from lib. I think the dagger+ohand is bis until zf (where as the staff isnt much better)
---
Gy also has alot of rares that can spawn. My experience on official servers is, that they are really rare (1/3 runs one rare)
---
So ye gy as caster = a must
---
As anything else = not a must but its possible to get good upgrades
---
You lost me in the first two sentences. Stay constructive! üëçüèª
---
Pool rage from the previous pull so you don't have to go empty into a new pull. Late game you'll also have furor to give you 10 rage every time you go into bear form.
---
Don't ignore your caster form abilities. You should often be pulling with moonfire if you don't have a rage pooled. You can even cast a wrath/starfire one mob, and immediately moonfire a 2nd mob on tricky pulls if your group gives you the time, but just stick to moonfire only when you're in a hurry. It's especially good for Line of Sight pulling. Later you can start an aoe pull with a few ticks of hurricane by placing it smartly so all the mobs get hit by an initial tick, then another tick while they're running toward you. You'll have time to go bear form before any mobs reach you.
---
Keep an eye on your mana pool, though. Doing this repeatedly can be mana intensive, but you'll regenerate mana in bear form. No need to stop for drinking, but use less mana intensive pull method when you're low. Pre-hotting yourself on some pulls is also useful.
---
At 40 it will be 90g for Mount and training combined if you're at honoured. Not sure about 60 tho.
---
Casual guilds? Doing quests together if someone needs help, making a dungeon together if some folks need to quest there, chat about daily stuff if someone is in the mood... that‚Äôs it.
---
1h has same dps as my 2h. Best way to lvl enha is 1h+shield. You can chain mobs with much less healing etc. So tell why asshole?
---
Got em
---
You're a cleft.
---
You can't prevent DDOS attacks, you can only mitigate them. They are a felony in many countries for a reason.
---
Last patch of TBC.
---
The attackers don't give a hoot what the wider community thinks, hence they're willing to DDoS the game.
---
This is exactly what I used to do ! Every raid night, basically the whole Rogue team would get to the mountain 1 hour early and cause mayhem, great times
---
Imagine being so beta that you can‚Äôt cut the tree down first.
---
A buttcrack would be a good example of a cleft in English.
---
Why did you re post this?
---
Fuck no. Kid started shit and got hit. I leave everyone alone and focus on my own leveling until someone attacks me. Then it's corpsecamp until that horde scum begs for a layer change.
---
your situation will be the same as mine, really. im levelling paladin now as ret, and just keep an int set in my bags to heal dungeons. Ill probably go holy at 58 or something and heal dungeons from there.
---
Yeah I uhhh, think it might be a joke
---
Mile instead of miles. Typo

No, they were a thing before Vanilla ended.

uhm can I get a source for that?

I literally give blessings out to anyone I see. Even the hunters pets

Barrens chat is way more political than it used to be. I wish they would just go back to chuck norris jokes and the mankirk's wife memes
---
I like this guy.
---
This makes me feel unrested
---
They mentioned as a possibility in the future if the servers needed it.
---
Thanks for the info, I was just worrying about it today. Anything I can do to help?
---
Greater than the tragedy of darth plagueis the wise.
---
I see your happy moment, and raise you "grinding the cloth yourself and make the bags to use and sell" moment. Time well spent.
---
Part of it may be that in Classic, there typically aren't actually enough quests to level you to the next area. This is why a lot of guides and players recommend killing everything you encounter while travelling.
---
Kill XP is a huge portion of your leveling, and sometimes you may need to literally just grind.
---
bags are worth it unless stupid high prices
---
a while ago I was seeing silk bags for 1g now its 40s
---
its good that u can resell them cuz no binding
---
Wrong I spam rank 1 arcane explosion and always catch them trying to come in for that sap....
---
A summery of 3-4 dungeons is that my renew does roughly 50% of the healing, PW:S does 15% (only used in emergency situations or when I'm hotting+shielding the tank up before a combat, so I can drink while he's pulling, and Heal does the rest. Focus on renew and spare your mana as much as possible, is what I've learned to be the most efficient both for mana usage and healing wise.
---
I can't give medium leather away on my server. I've seen on the AH, no joke, for 44c a skin. It vendors for 50c.
---
My best sellers are cloth and agility or strength greens.
---
Pretty sure its used for quest items. Say you are not on a quest, but another person in party is and after you loot the corpse even if it has nothing in, that person van get the quest item (if it drops)

yeah not going to read that much from you bud. And just tell me your name if you are on dreadmist eu so i can make sure to never tag with your kind. have fun ninjaing shit and getting kicked.
---
Agree the flying mounts should've been hard to obtain like in tbc
---
I just tried googling wtf happened and i'm getting nothing besides the fact that it happened. Is this related to WoW classic? those post says something about terrorism too??? wtf is going on
---
Get used to it. Sometimes you get nothing. Is it really worth posting on reddit about lmao
---
Just have to play DnD, where druids can be almost anything they want eventually &lt;3.

Tyson is that you from firelash - annex?

Why would you not get the mats urself and finding a tailor

I have /ty bound just cos of this

Yeah right OP you don‚Äôt have a girlfriend... *see username* oh hey bf this is awkward

Joining your party is too much work for a 2 minute (or 3 minute with talents) buff.

I just picked up the newspaper

Said that the wind blows

Can't go back to where I come from

Cos I'm not welcome

And it's not fun there

You know that I won't be late

Oh and I can't be saved

Did I say anything about drop rates? Trying to make sure other people are having it and it's not a problem on my end. You're a bit dense eh?
---
If you hate yourself? How come?
---
For 10 points who were Naga before they were Naga ?
---
That UI looks dope. Can you share the ElvUI string?
---
Why would it only be on your end lmao. When did I say anything about drop rates? The fuck
---
Try it. And then just pick a nice fantasy name instead of such shitty name
---
I‚Äôm lower level than you but I‚Äôm finding huge success farming elite humans that are about 3 levels below me
---
Ok, glad to know it's not just me. Thanks.
---
Fort costs a quarter of my mana right now so fuck that noise lol. Only if I run across a mage or Druid.
---
pm a mage when you are in a town for water and give him a few silvers. also toi dont really need water on priest before you start mindlfaying and even then if you dont want To drink you can use less minflay to be more or less infinite in your farm.
---
It still says mile, though
---
It's a CLEFT.
---
Or just bubble them. No rage means no threat.
---
actually worked out for me, i was doing a WC run, and didn't have time to finish because of work (thought i could have, but wasn't a great group), but didn't want to bail, servers went down, i went to work, got off, servers were good, im not even mad :)

How effective is Mind control in instances with plenty of humanoids?    
---
     
---
Can you basically play as an off tank / dps by primarily using mind control and getting mobs to fight each other, and then make any boss without an enrage tier cake by being a second healer?
---
Also Avoid jumping behind the stack of barrels in Goldshire Inn, there's no escape.
---
Thats caller using it then mr smart.
---
what faction
---
And after 4 forts you drink, knowing most of the mana from this drink will go to another fort, but the tank just keeps pulling.
---
Was in the middle of being ganked by a 31 rogue as a priest and he was just about to finish me off when a friendly warrior charged in and we were able to kill him.
---
Afterwards I said "ok we need to GTFO outta here he is mad af" as friendly warrior was hearthing while nodding.
---
What level should you start using heroic strike? Also what exactly is hamstring kiting? Just hamstring then backpeddle?
---
I think mobs have a base amount of frost resist, so they tend to resist spells quite often the lower level you are, but players have no base resistances outside of racial, so they don't seem to resist at all really, I could be wrong though.

Having trouble finding quests for my level. Level 18 now, have a few brown quests in Redridge, done the yellow ones, completed Westfall, done Loch Modan, and looking for another area to level in but none of my quests lead me someplace new. Any tips?Am hesitating to do Deadmines, don't know if my level is good enough and also very insecure because it would be my first time healing a dungeon as I'm a priest..
---
Cause we all are dreamers!

Cleaning out dust usually helps quite a lot, you can also download a Fan program like speed fan and manually set your fan speed to 80% or higher if you can be bothered.

A guild on my server has over 500 devilsaur leather and claims to be camping every spawn on every layer. They‚Äôre charging 450g for a set. I think I‚Äôm gonna transfer off üòÇ

it really do be like that

6 slot bags at low levels are legendaries

GOTTTEEEEEEEEEE!

You can‚Äôt ‚Äúninja‚Äù boe‚Äôs

Just play alliance if you're a little bitch and horde if you're an absolute champ, doesn't matter about server population really as long as there are some other little bitches for you to skip through the fields singing to animals with i'm sure you will have a lovely time.

Didn‚Äôt she actually try that once? When she summoned a shitton of water elementals and formed them into a tidal wave?

nah it just means that im finishing smoking and that soon i'll have better things to do. But nt sherlock.

Depends on what race they chose.

any luck?

I don‚Äôt worry about me either!  I‚Äôve been making terrible decisions and never logging off!

What's the best music to listen to while playing, to get the real World of Warcraft vanilla 2004-2006 vibe?

Protip for convos, use class colors to blur out names if theres more than one participant, it can be hard to distinguish who is your friend
---
Not just one or two, but 30-50 feral hogs comming straight for your pet companion. Keep guns legal in Azeroth
---
That happened to me once too! 
---
Flew from Org to Crossroads, as soon as the wyvern got to crossroads it just stayed hovering at the flightmaster for like 30 seconds.
---
Then, it teleported me about 50 feet in the air above the southfury river and said "Transfer aborted: Instance not found". I plummeted to the earth and survived with about 10% HP left, thankfully not crocs around to finish me off.
---
Literally not reading this. If you don‚Äôt want it, don‚Äôt play it.
---
Agreed. I doubt the belt would have done much for you OP if he'd equipped it. He probably would have ended up selling anyway.
---
He can walk to you guys. Or you can walk to him. Check YouTube for best routes on traveling to other starter zones at level 1.
---
This happens in tons of guilds that start at the launch of a server.

LOL THATS THE WEED NUMBER

Amazing, thanks!

i see thanks man

The ingame music
---
Not on my comp atm but if I remember correctly Atlas goes directly in the interfaces folder (not inside addons).  I currently use it and it works fine.
---
Cheers for the help bro
---
Which is also true of the world. I mean Abraham lincoln was a republican, that's not a lie. At one point republicans must have stood for what I believe in. But times have changed. WHich is why it's smarter to follow what you know to be right, instead of putting blind faith in any outside influence. Which I guess is something peopole can learn from WOD. Which brings me to my point. People cry about wanting to escape into their games, but isn't it possible they can also learn lessons from their games and their stories and their art, lessons they can take into the real world?
---
Had a fellow gnome (quest giver) look down at me and say ‚ÄúMY! YOURE A TALL ONE!‚Äù I‚Äôve never been more insulted in my life.
---
Is it possible to make a macros, to make an attack (melee, ranged, skill) will be executed in parallel with a call for my pet to attack a target? Example: concussive shot + pet attack or autoshoot + pet attack. Should I create macros for each my attack ability or there is some universal workaround? BTW I've never created a macros.
---
Dirty alliance propaganda.
---
Virtual terrorists lol.
---
I'm just throwing Curse of Weakness on melee and Curse of Tongues on caster while passing by.
---
By typing "/who 23-25 c-"shaman" all the shamans within that level range are displayed. So it's a great way to form groups to your need :)
---
You could try darkshore in kalimdor
---
Mind Soothe is great when soloing/gathering and you cbf dealing with a mob. I wouldn't call it necessary but it's a bit more fun than garbage.
---
Mind Vision actually seems bugged to me - I swear you could go much further with it by jumping from target to target, now it breaks really quickly, but maybe that was a later xpac. I don't recommend picking that up
---
i am interested in the fun element i just find it more fun killing things easier xD
---
I might be totally wrong, but I think even that doesn't happen. We have polanski free since years in our country and the us can't get to him.
---
roger that
---
alexa play prevenge by they might be giants
---
Which sucks, because this behaviour should require public shaming.
---
I will never play on PVE, I enjoy PVP, just not that /wave /thank then attack when you have the numbers or after I save your life and questing. THAT, I can't understand
---
First congrats on gaining two years from your post a year when you were 19 and looking for someone. 
---
Have you ever posted anything on Reddit in any context where you did not mention that you are a female. 
---
It is funny, there are two possibilities that have the same outcome. 
---
1. You are a male that likes attention so you play a girl. 
---
2. You are a girl that cannot make it a day without guys talking to you. 
---
Both lead to an outcome of you being crazy and I am guessing very spazmatic and quick to temper and block people.
---
The only major difference between your cat and any other, at thus point, is his coat.

Broken tooth is the best Pet as BM still, because of the frenzy uptime as he crits more often with 1.0 speed.

AS MM/surv he's just used for the pushback

You‚Äôre a guild guild master?

fookin apes
---
It does work on players, I do it in Duskwood on the massive pathway on people going from Darkshire and sometimes they don't even realise they're going the wrong way until they're all the way back in Darkshire
---
Maybe turn off the FPS cap if you've got it on (for background and foreground). Might be getting confused if you're multitasking? Wild shot.
---
I personally prefer alliance because of their starting zones. The alliance starting zones are more interesting terrain wise. The horde just has a bunch of desert. Except the undead, their starting zone (and capital city) are my favorite horde areas
---
It's always been like that lol.
---
Rogues are the #1 most balanced match up against mages and they are conincidentally the ones wielding two weapons.
---
The 3 second frost trap will win the duel in 90% of the cases for the mage.
---
You only need to have it proc once to win pretty much every single fight.
---
I think it isn't about laws but more about the punishment. My guess is that we don't want people getting death penalty when it's not a thing here or people in horrible prisons across the world.
---
Maybe the pirate bandit humanoids south east of gadgetstan

PR Man : Use the anonymous terrorist card.
---
Thanks bro glad you enjoyed it :)
---
TBC and wrath were shit? I think you just lost any hope of anyone agreeing with you.
---
Nice try.
---
Its about normal
---
Thanks
---
18 is enough for DM. Just tell the group it's your first time so they know to pull accordingly. Westfall, redridge and duskwood should provide you enough quests or same level mobs to grind to proceed. Kill mobs while moving from place to place, dont just rely on quests. You can also do multiple DM runs if you like it, dungeons give decent xp. Good luck :)
---
Damn are there any more of these for like 40-45 or 50 etc
---
Tribes, mother fuckers.
---
Yea I‚Äôm trying to figure out if horde can make me happy. Part of it will depend on if and which friends who were potentially down to play are in or not. I don‚Äôt mind doing the whole new experience thing myself but I think I‚Äôll be a bit lost on the horde side and if my new friends join who‚Äôve never played before I‚Äôd rather take them down a path I kinda know so we‚Äôre not all completely lost. Or perhaps they‚Äôll have a particular faction they want to try more and we‚Äôll just do that. 
---
Just tryna figure out some pros for both factions. I know alliance quite well I know I like the cities I know I like deadmines and dun morogh and elwynn forest, but I don‚Äôt know much about whether people tend to like the horde counterparts and why. I guess that was the aim of this post.
---
made me lol, but where's that artwork from. looks awsome
---
Same in turkey Superonline net
---
No, I don't think those alliance gank horde are scumbags, they are doing the right thing on a PVP server. Just not /wave /thank pretend to be friendly, that is fucking cheap
---
How can you say people have asked for it for 15 years when you could still play vanilla 12 and half years ago
---
EU or US?
---
As a priest I prioritise the pets for Stam buff
---
I still have this issue.
---
Have you found a fix?
---
lol ayt the undeadf with awkward running position in the guild Village Idiots =)
---
Any later and it's too hot out.
---
Yet here we are, typing words into this terrible post.
---
Is this EU or?
---
Good guy Deathwing building a roof for the uncivilized orcs!
---
Oh look a dudes opinion being thrown around as a fact. People enjoy different things then you mate and I know more people who loved tbc way more than vanilla after all that is their opinion not yours.
---
No, please do take it personal, feed the hate that's the fuel for PvP. You did the right thing!
---
Or better known as the "Cleft of pallet"
---
They were already told this. It's on them at this point.
---
It all comes down to the actual play time you have, at least for me. I would like to play on a pvp server but chose a pve because I am sort of a casual player. I would hate it if one day I would have only one hour to play and  end up spending it getting ganked.
---
15 year old game. The amount of informaation available about wow vanilma and classic is astounishing.
---
If this came as a surprise then its on that player himself.
---
Episode 4: Our ragtag quartet of misfits reach the town of Lakeshire in the Redridge Mountains. There, their client reveals that in order to get the information they seek, they need to free his brothers from their curse. However, complications arise when Guy ends up creating a rather...fuzzy problem...and draws the wrath of Kit. Goddammit Guy...
---
 I feel like I also had something else to say, but I've honestly completely forgotten what it was. Hopefully it wasn't anything too important :P. Sorry for the delay btw; had stuff in real life that slowed things down.
---
Oh yea
---
Anyone working with clique? Seems bugged. I can't use any spells that are keybound to the same key I use to heal targets.
---
1 is renew on Friendly targets but also shadow word pain.
---
Shadow word pain doesn't work..
---
it works in theory it just takes a long ass time. The raiding guild i raided with from wrath till MoP had a core of maybe 25 members and by mop we pretty much always gave each other free shit mind the occasional recruit that we didnt know yet. guilds are still forming and building, i imagine in a year it would be like the guide says
---
maybe higher ranks, so far heal and greater heals are 3 sec.
---
Cant log into battlenet. Anybody with the same issue?

Another vote for Luna, can't play without it.

Nah I play on Felstriker - Oceanic servers.
---
Two point rebuttal to the PSA
---
1. A ton of hybrids are tanking and DPS to level, but still collecting gear to heal since you do not need to be that spec till 60. You would be crazy to level as holy if not living in an instance. 
---
2. If APES didn't show you that you can end game in all greens and blues with 15 level 55-59 (meaning you can do any spec once people are all 60), you have not been paying attention. 
---
The mentality of BiS and perfect build is based on a game without good guides and YouTube videos. 
---
Keep thinking people won't beat bosses Witt ferals, moonkins and ret paladins.
---
Thanks you!
---
Yea, cool, but in the meantime I can't stop looking at your 2 unitframes for a party.
---
the hell's the matter with you people? are addons/UIs such an alien beast?
---
Still a friendly hello from madoran from firelash my rngesus be in your favor.
---
Atlas from my understanding is just the base addon, you need a module for it to work correctly such as ‚ÄòAtlas Classic WoW‚Äô
---
Until you are around late 20s or lower, it‚Äôs often not worth it to HS just for the rested bonus if you are logging in for the night. Make sure you weigh the time spent traveling back vs. the bonus XP you gain.
---
At 35+, rested bonus becomes much more worthwhile, esp. if only play in the evenings.
---
Of course! I like the personal connection - we're not friends, I get that, but it's a lot more fun and participatory than just being super passive. Plus, some of the ones I watch are just super funny and that makes whatever they're playing more entertaining.
---
Hillsbrad/Arathi and Desolace. STV has a lot of quests but you need to take into account how much time you spend dead and competing, and is it worth it in the end. I'm soon 36 and haven't touched stv. Also grinding mobs is a chill way to level and get gold for upcoming 40 mount
---
I'll try
---
Cast while moving is worth it.
---
Did you download the whole suite or just the atlas add-on itself? Look for a suite, it should be a folder with a bunch of other folders in it.
---
I am leveling a priest and it feels like I've hit a wall now at level 30. Mobs take forever to kill, and when I quest I am often ganked. Dungeons work but have had consecutive bad experiences in Gnomeregan and SM. 
---
How did you get past this leveling  wall?
---
Of course you're a hunter.
---
I specifically choose this fate for the challenge and have always enjoyed the paladin class fantasy. I‚Äôm ready for what comes next and will do my best to make it work to it‚Äôs fullest potential.
---
                                          - some Ret paladin

Hello friend üôåüèª
---
We don't argue with idiots, we just want them gone.
---
DDOSing and other similar cyber crimes are not just American law, it's illegal in most parts of the world. The FBI or other equivalent parties will most definitely be looking into this, and if/when an arrest is made, they could very much so be extradited to the US. Where you live does not make you invincible.
---
You do know that griefing didn't suddenly just get invented on 27/08/19 when Wow classic released buddy. You are talking about the phenomenon of people being dicks to other people on the internet when they would never do that IRL to someone. This has been happening online since the very first anonymous forums and games.
---
Keep your hearthstone for logouts :)
---
Missed opportunity to have RGB bags in that order
---
WoW was in development for 5+ years, so it did take some time to make it all. Still a great feat, though.
---
Hogger is EK tho
---
Not talking about 12 slot bags, these are 14 slotters
---
Anyone know when the "keyring bag" will be added?
---
Got my Workshop key but it just looted into my regular bags.
---
This is legitimately the hardest I‚Äôve laughed in quite a while. Thank you.
---
I don't want to waste all the time running back to where I was. It's not fun so, as I said, sometimes I log out in place if I'm far away from the quest turn-in spot.
---
Same, can't login the app since morning and can't login to game manually.
---
I use necromancy addon (I think that's it's name). Puts all my shards in a specific bag and it'll even start deleting them for me after I have X shards.
---
Well sure if his arguement was "its a pvp server and you bothered me so ill bother you" but it wasnt. It was that he needs it for questing

Does Enrage no longer proc from /sit criticals?
---
if i am a druid tank and i am about to die and the healer is dead, i always make sure to Battle rez them just before i die
---
All things you can do in retail..
---
1000 mile stare. This guy has seen some shit.
---
People played with these builds during vanilla. If you're looking for a group and your only healing, or tanking options is one of these builds, then you take them or wait.
---
They aren't useless, they simply aren't the best
---
ARE YOU DEAF? A HORSE FLIGHT PATH

I realized this the other day too, grabbing my rogue quest.
---
Consider my mind truly blown
---
Why cant i make any hunter send me the excact macro for Feign Death/trap that is  confirmed working at the moment?
---
Diesel is the reason Wall-E was left behind
---
I like and dislike his portrayal of Michael. 
---
It was creepy and slow and plodding, which looked great in hospital corridors. U fortunately, it wasn‚Äôt accurate to how Nick Castle portrayed Michael. 
---
It also firmly established the trope that Michael is a slow moving monster that somehow always catches up, which I dislike. Castle walked deliberately and with purpose at a steady but quick pace.
---
it's not about PvE only. In PvP the situation is quite similar: hybrids lack essential utility skills like interrupts, reliable cc chains and/or damage, to say nothing of spec-specific gear.
---
It seems like you way overpaid, Runecloth bags cost like 2g 80s each on most servers

---
Morgraine is pretty bad in my opinion. It was easily 4:1 in STV. I am currently in Tanaris which is 5+:1. Horde are constantly outside ZF in big groups.
---
Ehhhh, yes and no. I agree with this on paper, and for the most part I wish mods weren't as strict in most places, but there's need to be *some* rules against off-topic shitposting or the sub turns into a karma farm and we'd never actually get posts about the game.
---
Darksouls 2 i think, dlc even?
---
All very good points but the game is there to be played and explored, if you know the alliance areas don't you think it will be a little bit boring but again i totally get if your friends play alliance but of you manage to sway your mates to play horde, trust me there are alot of beautiful place to explore :)
---
Eeee! Yes! This was my favorite part if Vanilla fishing! I had forgotten about boxes!
---
Wait, what happened?

Spoiler: the rabbit in this picture wins in DS2

Driving too fast? Jail. Slow? Jail. Right away.

What do you think does "need" and "greed" mean?
---
Hmm that seems kind of cheap. I thought Spy only worked if they appeared in your combat log?
---
That's a tool actual morons use to sustain their delusion that they aren't nearly braindead.  They tell themselves other people are so stupid they don't have to engage them.  It's easier to cling to ignorance than challenge yourself.
---
Absolutely!

    #showtooltip serpent sting
---
    /cast !Auto Shot
---
    /petattack
---
    /cast serpent sting
---
This is my "barely-paying-attention-to-the-game-but-still-killing-stuff"-macro (which I bound to mouse button 5). It basically starts your auto shot, sends your pet in to attack and casts serpent sting all in one click.
---
Just make a macro for your spells like this
---
#Showtooltip Earth Shock
---
/startattack
---
/cast Earth Shock
---
You could try clearing your DNS cache on your computer. To do so open the command line tool (assuming you are on windows) as an administrator and type "ipconfig /flushdns"
---
After that you should get a message that the process was successful and then you should restart your pc.
---
Oversimplified explanation:
---
Your computer saves IP's to web addresses. Battle.net is actually an IP.
---
What this command does is it clears "known paths" to certain servers (E.g. Battle.net =&gt; 69.420.69.420) and requests new ones. What could have happened is that blizzard might have changed some architecture and you are now trying to connect to an "old" or "outdated" server.
---
Ps I know that the IP address in the example is not possible like that, I just wanted to be a 69 420 boy

People who think that just cause apes rolled mc they'll be able to casually raid in a guild full of meme specs are in for a rude shock, especially once bwl and aq40 come out.
---
Exactly
---
I‚Äôve been running 4mages and a priest from 28-41 just grinding am.
---
I maybe took a one to two level break questing a little bit in various places
---
I have no patience for fishing.  I think I never got past skill 37 in 15 years of playing wow on any character and these days I don't even pick it up at all.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't "/startattack" start your melee attack? I think it has to be "/cast !Auto Shot" to start your ranged attack.
---
That was the same thing they said for MC, until it happened. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm not bashing classic. I am freaking playing it as much or more then the next guy. 
---
Stop kidding yourself that you couldn't wreck bwl with a guild with off specs. The instances ARE NOT, as hard as people remembered. The game (instances) got nerfed some by this patch. AQ was literally impossible for a while. Not any more. 
---
Add to that with it really was more about ten people not knowing a fight, so regardless of gear, could wipe the group. 
---
With all the videos, BWL and AQ will be the same as MC. Beat literally the first day they come out since people will already have the MC gear. 
---
They will be then farmed with moonkins and other hybrids.
---
I feel like it's an opportunity for a vegan activist speech qnd getting downvoted but I am a bit lazy, so lucky for you
---
Yikes
---
Is that curling?
---
You could say that indeed! Especially considering there are children waiting for the day they feel good. Happy birthday, happy birthday.
---
Fuck that master
---
Never did. It was a bug on private servers
---
This probably a lazy question to ask but what servers are currently down?
---
Stormwind chat is LFG /LFM exclusive
---
Yes. I sell overflow of leather or patterns or cloth.
---
Everything I have posted has sold. 
---
That said, I don‚Äôt ‚Äúwork‚Äù the auction house. Never have.
---
But it's not enough. If you actually care about WoW, you should agree with me.
---
I've been looking for 30 minutes now.
---
Do you know how I turn off these 2 lines:

---
I've been able to shave most of the unwanted things off of my tooltip for now, thanks!
---
Your son talks to you? Damn you're lucky.
---
DDossers are just trolls with a plan.
---
Yeah as a hunter I either throw out a serpent sting or concussive shot depending on health of mob/player and send my pet in for a nibble. It's literally all I can do.
---
Now I know why I get ganked all the time, even tho I don't engage the opposite faction at all ü§î
---
But everything in this game has a value. BoP's, BoE's, peoples time etc. You can't just cherry pick and say BoE's only. Lets say your BiS  BoP item drops and its worth 5g. I am 5g away from my epic mount and roll need. You are gonna be pissed off cos to you thats your BiS but to me its my epic mount. Up to that point we had all contributed the same amount of time in that run so why shouldn't i roll for it? Sure I could farm that gold but at the same time you could also farm the dungeon for your drop.
---
Thats why people take issue with such things because its just common courtesy to let people have their upgrades or people would just be rolling need on everything as there is always something someone needs gold for.
---
Is it possible to make a macro to drop Soul Shards?
---
R14 paladin, agammagan real server.
---
I am guessing you were throwing out the rank card to prove your own point wrong, that hybrids are viable in PvP.
---
Depends on you tbh. I've run staffs all the way up to 37. Dagger/shield has less downtime and proccs flurry more often.
---
I think he looks awesome apart from the silly cloth  hood lol. You could atleast hide your helm :)
---
Yeah sounds like Pyxis alright
---
This is amazing.
---
Surely now we have layers this item is much more likely than it was in Classic which was just one big layer?
---
Agreed.
---
Dreadmist doesn't feel like unbalanced to me, but people are rarely agressive.
---
Have you considered be is at a level where runecloth isnt available yet so he cant farm it.
---
How do I get stances for my orc warrior and is it good to go for a tankish build early so I can get into dungeon groups easily? First time playing wow ever btw.
---
Simple question : Is it possible to ask simple questions if not in this thread every Sunday? I feel like the last time i made a question post it got removed for being a "googleable" question even though at that time i already tried googling and i couldn't find anything. Classic has way different balancing than other patches so its hard to get the correct info you want. Is this the only place to ask questions?
---
2. Where can I ask specific questions about certain classes? Like "How to deal with fear as a hunter" etc?
---
Ya know, I've always had a policy that if someone tries to ninja then EVERYONE IN THE PARTY NEEDS. You then trade it to the poor soul who actually needs it.
---
Most of your damage should come from wanding. Do you have a decent wand for your level? If not I would try to upgrade it. 
---
Have you specced into wand specialization and spirit tap? IMO these should never be skipped while leveling a priest.
---
Man I miss machinimas
---
This helped. Thank you
---
If you spec 31 points into Demonology you can summon an Infernal which is one of the coolest abilities in the game. Unfortunately it does kinda suck
---
What's wrong with hoping to be accommodated by a company that I am a customer of? I'm not calling them complaining or talking to them about it and making a big deal, simply asking that a service provided by blizz to only a portion of their player base to be offered to everyone.
---
But the XP bonus is worth the little extra time to run back :(
---
It's simple really the customer support for retail
---
MINIONS!
---
Call them MINIONS  or DEMONS
---
lvl 1: Imp    (annoying little bugger, shoots fireballs and buffs stamina)  
---
lvl 10: Voidwalker  (tank)  
---
lvl 20: Succubus  (seduce and dps)  
---
lvl 30: Felhunter (anti magic)  
---
lvl 40: felsteed (mount)  
---
lvl 50: Infernal  (cost reagent and 1 hour cooldown, outdoors only)  
---
lvl 60: Doomguard, requires 5 man and a sacrifice)
---
30-42 is THE wall.
---
That's part of why SM farming is as popular as it is: ain't nobody got time for Gnome Mages/Undead Rogues in Stranglethorn Vale.
---
Quests are spread out, mobs spike up in resilience, and runbacks get frustrating.
---
I'd recomend biting the bullet and smashing out some SM Graveyard and a few Library runs after you finish up Thousand Needles (Horde) or Hillsbrad (Alliance). A solid wand upgrade (the one from the rare spawn in Graveyard for example) and a couple of good items slotted in elsewhere make a massive difference.
---
The rule exists because you can just photoshop someone else in there and give him bad reputation
---
This campaign was my favourite part of the whole WC3 era
---
We have been engaging with you, we've been telling you your arguments are stupid, your opinion is stupid and you should reconsider what fair is, because you've been wrong. Gold is not the utimate worth, achieving something is. Getting an upgrade for your gear is a reward, having it stolen out from under you is infuriating especially when it's a pos asshole that is just going to get an extra buck out of it.
---
And I'm done now, I'm going to take a shower.
---
BRING OUT THE SWORD OF THOUSANDTH TRUTHS TO THE BATTLE FIELD!
---
You will speak to him in a later quest. Not spoiling anything for you, just keep enjoying the game.
---
Uhm int is everything to a lock they scale with gear massivly. The spirit would be good for solo questing but in a group at your level you can smartly life tap and a healer can keep up. 2 Stam makes less is a negligible difference.
---
I see, didn't know that. Saw a guide video saying to macro charge with /sit. Thanks!
---
Imagine paying 100g for a mount. Rep discount ftw.
---
I think the standard float data type in c has 6-7 decimals. If they use double precision floats it's about 15. Which makes a real tie extremely unlikely. If it still happens you can still reroll just to be safe.
---
This is like the old [Death Grip + Chains of ice CC](https://youtu.be/WYLPnIBn3Y0?t=35)
---
WoW started to change drastically through and after WotLK, but it still remained a good game up to the end of MoP. So 5.4. After that it went completely off the deep end.
---
I don‚Äôt see anything wrong with the default ui. Played xcore from vanilla to end of wotlk with default ui and it worked fine for me.
---
Nothing probably, but I laughed a bit at you hoping for something improbable instead of going on a mumble with your friends,agree to reroll and go on a new server.
---
At least their happiness will increase.
---
Shadow and frost are suggested because of mages and fear. If you go arcane you are only countering a specific spell(pylomorph) and nature you are only countering entageling roots and hibernation.
---
More horde filth to kill, works fine with me.
---
Yup. We are 2 removed posts away from pictures of murlocs with trump's head photoshopped on to them. I like a fair bit of the "low efforts", but itsa slippery slope that leads to a straight up cliff. 
---
That being said,  if any body is short on karma,  feel free to post my idea to the regular wow sub for some instant front page anti trump karma.  It's free real estate.
---
lol. #realtalk
---
That seems like it shouldn't be allowed. Bit like radar. Even if I was a non stealth class, people should still be able to sneak up on others
---
BWL is quite easy, not that much harder than MC. But AQ40 is a completely different beast indeed.
---
Why does Auto Shot need to be included? Doesn‚Äôt it Auto ‚Äúshoot‚Äù once you engage with SS?
---
I mostly use it because it gives even further cushion between my wrist and the desk, and I haven't had any kind of ache in said wrist ever since I bought it.
---
Might be. I can't test right now.
---
My own experience is no1 will ever focus on your pet in 1v1... The reason why people suggest frost/shadow/fire is for aoe?
---
 there are tons of class guides on Youtube, Wowhead and other MMO portals that are written by dedicated players for other dedicated players. Vast majority of vanilla playerbase are casuals that are not prepared to put at least twice the effort to be viable compared to "pure" classes.
---
Depends on your server.
---
Ok, I'll call them Minions/demons now on.
---
wrong order and you missed one, but good try
---
Damage.
---
Oh my god I actually laughed out loud.  No exhaling out of my nose here.  TOO funny!
---
Comparing 9/11 to a DDOS?
---
This addition would make it soooooo much better, and the effort nearly triples!!!
---
Not to me. That's a lot of wasted time just running around. I was continuously running back to a rest area when I started, but I hate doing it and I hate running back to where I was to continue questing. So, now I just don't. I don't care about the rest. I care more about being able to get into the action of the game asap. That's what's fun to me =). I hate running around everywhere, so minimizing that is best. 
---
On the other hand, if I was going to be logged out for several days, I might consider just hearthing to get the rest. At that point it might accumulate enough rest to matter to me. 
---
I only get to play in spurts. I don't want to waste any time essentially doing nothing.
---
Buffing people as a paladin, I know they've gotta move fast to get use out of it.
---
Any dungeon grinding guides? I am a level 32 warrior ally side &amp; sorta stuck on where to go to level up in general
---
What‚Äôs that robe?
---
The difference is that boes can be bought... if a person loses a roll on a boe they can go buy that boe from the winner or someone else entirely. That's how the boes have universal standardized value.  Bops don't have that.   If you can't see the difference here you're being intentionally blind.
---
Damn. Maybe you could have corrected me then, instead of just pointing it out...
---
How it feels playing classic as a hunter atm: Bugs, bugs and even more bugs.
---
I would say around 7 letters
---
I agree with just about everything you're saying, but I don't believe the levelling experience was changed until Wrath, was it? The mount levels certainly werent reduced by TBC.
---
3ft of fury
---
Try using a phone cord. They have two wires, amd will fit in an ethernet jack.
---
Yes because lowkey racism is the best kinda racism!
---
And here we have the wild scumbag, who will be kicked from many groups and make many enemies.
---
Must be alliance. On horde we mosquito swarm those higher level than us.
---
And back to name calling.   Blocked.
---
Sure, here you go.  It's only fair that I verify my claims since I'm the one making them.  Saying something like "goOlGE" would be asinine. 
---
/r/classicwow/comments/d10tit/comment/ezgtccd
---
I may also be shit at AH as it's my first time being serious on wow, but to me it doesnt matter since you can make decent money without it.
---
Just because something takes effort, doesn't mean its worthwhile content. Just because something is low effort, doesn't mean its worthless content. It's a stupid rule.
---
Leveling is actually a small drop in the bucket for playtime in the end. 
---
Warrior is too DPS, too tanking, and Top PvP (paired with healer). 
---
Those are facts. Those are why so many are making "the sacrafice"
---
There is a really good video on youtube about this specific question.
---
So wait, Zoomers are older gamers and boomers are younger gamers? What's a neck beard? Feel free to flame, I'm just a confused old man...not joking
---
I hope this is not the case and I actually don‚Äôt think it will be. With a greater number of the player population being familiar with optimal rotations and all the info on the fights out there, players should be able to get by with not as great gear.
---
Yeah me too. It‚Äôs amazing how much they got right on their first shot. The Game was really ahead of it‚Äôs time
---
Wow, that's terrible lmao
---
/Oblg. [Reality](https://i.chzbgr.com/full/4680278016/h3C91D8D1/).

Rookie numbers, level 60, 6 days 19 hours played
---
I feel like I‚Äôm the only person that doesn‚Äôt like leveling up. I like questing, I like exploring, I wanna do all the quests in all the zones (I know it‚Äôs impossible, that‚Äôs where alts should come in). Every level up I go aw shiet grey quests
---
Yeah, kinda wish Blizzard made the LFG channel more prominent
---
I found a similar addon:" **Atlas World Map Classic**" , however it doesn't have the same high res and is implemented in weird way
---
it do be like that
---
https://reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cnsh17/addon_mega_thread/
---
It says the same thing but is listed under the ‚Äúkinda working‚Äù addons.
---
I would, but I just posted the list in the post above already in the same minute so it would be a bit double.
---
now please click on this innocent looking portal.......
---
Paladin tier sets are not designed for healers lol. Only tier 3
---
You're the one advocating for an unequal system.  My system is objectively more fair because it's 100% fair.
---
So I'm not the only rogue doing this, good to know
---
Power tripping guild masters are weird. They're usually weak mid 40's single childless men who hate their boss and need to exert their small amount of power any way they can.
---
Ah okay, good info. What level should I go to lib then? Do people just stay there until they level up to progress to the next one, or just do a few runs for an item type thing and weave in quests?
---
Will you shut up with your politics? No one comes here to hear your takes or political views. This is a videogame forum.
---
&gt;Barrens chat is way more political than it used to be.
---
Lol..... No. No it isn't
---
would be, if he sold it... or just destroyed it
---
Its hard to find info on this stuff thats not outdatated or from other patches etc... From my own experience,
---
\&gt; /petpassive
---
\&gt; /cast Feign Death
---
works the best, then you manually put the trap you want. Works great in pve. In pvp though, FD will not work if there are totems or the enemy player is not fooled by it. If he attacks you while you are in FD you will be back in combat and you can't trap. So I think most people suggest stunning first, and then you can get the guarantee FD + trap off.
---
My comment is that private servers pushed the mentality of results at any price.
---
A meta that pushes certain classes aside is unhealthy.
---
Again!?
---
Must be a Bengal thing
---
Yeah obvs you‚Äôll end up paying 90g but 100 comes easy. Also lvl 40 spells are generally important and expensive
---
*parry*
---
You think you're right, but you're wrong
---
When you suggest to your GF she should take it up the ass
---
I used to do it a lot I vanilla! However people now are whispering (I assume) 10 people + at a time, and I've been asked 5 or so times and every single time I never get a response after "sure I'll go".
---
There are no achievements in classic. UBRS can be cleared in all greens. There's no point in stacking your group because even the worst group imaginable can clear the content.
---
As someone who just did those awful underwater vile reef quests in STV, I thank you!  (Though admittedly a shaman buffed me for that one, but it‚Äôs the thought that counts)
---
Also those sweet sweet summons to dungeon groups.
---
Miss, dodge, resist, resist, resist, miss, parry.
---
Tbf I hate being randomly invite spammed aswell. I'm open to join a guild, as long as I'm being asked first. I just think it's rude to just spam invite anything that moves. Really doesn't make the guild look good.
---
Technically turns the 5v2 into a 5v1, because you are channeling the mind control. You are probably also losing out on DPS if your target deals less damage.
---
Yeah, go to a slavic country and perhaps realize that most ppl are nice, many speak english and the beer is cheap
---
Same with old school runescape. The OSRS mods are always on their Reddit.
---
I found it hard to kill mages they just freeze me and play in the deadzone. I cannot melee or range attack.
---
Imagine Alliance being 65% and Horde being 35% where players constantly try to Zerg you because they suck and can‚Äôt play on an even footing. The only time they feel safe is holding hands with their pals. Despite all this they still cry &amp; throw a tantrum when you spank them back when all you wanted to do in the first place is be left a lone but they just have to keep poking their nose in your business.  
---
It‚Äôs all that but the other way around.
---
This guy is  going to the overpopulated faction, so he will never be alone and say he is a champ. 
---
I don't need to play in horde to win.
---
Rank 1!!!
---
SHOW ME THE MONEY THEN? WHERE IS YOU'RE PROOF?! HE SAY SHE SAY THATS WHAT IT IS, you're all full of shit haha
---
Wait, why? Berserking once every few minutes is that good?
---
Thr main pvp spec for shaman is ele.
---
Similarly the main pvp spec for druid is part feral. And feral is fairly viable in pve - nothing like prot or enh etc.
---
Maybe you should learn which of the specs are actually near unworkable and which arent before making posts like these where you are pretending to inpart your wisdom on other players.
---
Does that work in classic? Doesn't it enter inventory as soulbound? I thought later expansions added the option to trade in the dungeon
---
They're all up
---
My pet constantly gets polyd by mages so far.
---
Stuck on a flight taxi? This is the true vanilla experience.
---
Night elves.
---
How many days played does it take to be level 60 on average?
---
At which level did you make half of the way in terms of playing time?
---
I know better than you is the textbook example of elitism. Only if someone else acknowledge your skills you are good.
---
Cant expect anything serious from someone named squidbilly lol....
---
Flip it ya boomer
---
The problem is that you can apply the same logic to every single item in the game, at which point the rolling system will be pointless. An item will always have "X" value, as you put it - doesn't matter the rarity, usabillity or anything Else. Why would your arbitruary "auction house" gold value be any more *valuable* than anyone elses "vendor value"?
---
Besides it's a bad point and a stupid argument. The only reason you can apply your logic, is because you're working with definitions you have chosen yourself. In the same way you have defined *value* based on gold, *value* is subjective and change based on the person who rolls actual *need* of that item, which again, is subjective. Why would your "gold" value be more *valuable* than my "apperance" value? My day might be just as good as yours because I look cool in whatever item that drops, than yours would be with the extra gold. Therefore there is, and has always been, as is the point of the greed/need system in the first place, certain socially applied rules in place. In short it goes something like: you can use it+it's an upgrade &gt; minor upgrade &gt; offspec &gt; profession &gt; raw gold value.
---
There's many reason for this, one being that most players are doing the content where the item drops, *specifically* for that drop, or gear upgrade in general - whereas farming gold can be done far more effectively outside of that content.
---
In the end it's a set of socially applied and policed set of rules and guidelines, so while you can do "whatever you want" thinly veiled behind your dumbass attempts to look like you know basic argumentation, it comes down to one simple sentance: don't be a dick.
---
Also check out /r/iamverysmart, you might find some good Company in there. :)
---
They obviously meant hippogryph. /hip-po-grif/ /s
---
Pretty sure blind and scare beast are nature too. What about my final question, what do I do with the spare training points? Some 3rd resistance or armor?
---
What are you talking about? Tier 1 is all +healing. So it's not good for DPS, or tanking (the other roles). Tier 2 is +spell damage, but no good melee stats. So it's also only for healing.
---
Nothing says Gnomish engineering like a 40% failure rate.

Yes I think so

Random PSA, theres a 14 slot from Mauradon and a 14 slot from a quest in STV available right now.
---
*cringe*
---
No, because you're right
---
How i feel as a warrior when someone needs help killing a mage. Buddy i don't fuck with mages that are even 5 levels below me
---
You won‚Äôt even be able to hit him
---
How did you know he was 60 when you we're only 40?
---
1 million exploding night elf ghosts can.
---
Alliance? Me personally I did Duskwood and then Ashenvale and then Hillsbrand before proceeding. So i only went to new zones like STV and Arathi when i'm like 33-35. When you outlevel, people dont fuck with you normally. Going in any 30+ zone as the lowest level in the zone is just asking to get killed. I try to only do areas where i'm at least higher than enemies. Even as lv30, i feel its fine to go back to level 20-30 zones and complete the quests eventhough they're green. Beats getting ganked..
---
Also would run Gnomer at least once for the quests. SM is more like a 35+ thing
---
Level 36 with almost 3days /played
---
I'm already at over 6 days played time and just about to hit 50. I've spent a lot of time traveling and playing the AH, and there are already 60s everywhere, so it can be accomplished relatively quickly if you don't waste time.
---
Unions are better because your not supporting Amerikkkan imperialism
---
And there it is!
---
There is like 3 separate dependencies to get the map to work. I think it might still throw out some errors it‚Äôs half-way working needs a bit of debugging. You should be able to tell if you‚Äôre missing anything though it tells you what you‚Äôre missing when you hover over addons
---
With luck they are. They just need tons of people.

Ahh, the Robes of Arugal + Ghostly Mantle combo, all achievable in single lucky kill of Arugal

I'll never argue for a norm over a logical superior.  Literally only idiots do that.   People like you are the reason racism and sexism exist lol
---
Didnt TFT came well after WoW was in development?
---
But yes, that's mine and possibly most people's favourite campaign.
---
You misread slav as rusian?
---
Play whatever makes you happy. The travel is what makes classic great. Just enjoy your ride.
---
Blessed
---
You just need to kill a lot of boars and use the sword of a thousand truths.
---
You are so wise. It's a shame most people in this sub are not.
---
My addons caused some bad FPS drops randomly at one point. I had to reload UI and it hasn‚Äôt happened since.
---
If there's no downsides then they even should make it roll 100 times if needed since with that many players and that many drops someone's someday gonna be the first rolling for x time.
---
I shouldn‚Äôt have chuckled but I did
---
Toilet paper and Gnaws?
---
I do live in a slavic country and no, many people here doesn't speak english at all.

Nope, quite the opposite.

Anyone?

Where do you live that you can't do a 15 min walk to a shop to get a replacement, lol.
---
I understand how you want to use the rolls.  I'm saying there's a way that's more fair.  You don't want more fair you're like an old.man afraid of change you want things to stay the same even if a better alternative exists.  Sad to see
---
Thousand needles will blow your mind :)

Nobody likes you when you're 23.
---
Razorgore is wonderful
---
Can confirm, Dreadmist is awesome
---
Really, just stfu. Just a bunch of skeptical twats on here. God damn.
---
It is like vanilla all over again.
---
Yeah, it was one of my first ever experiences in wow. The low level traveling can be so fun! Just try to unlock the flightmasters on your way, this will come in very handy on the long run.
---
!remindme 7hours

Hello fellow slavic wow player.
---
Oh crap that's the "Marau" one i was on about, my bad.
---
Hit demoralizing shout a bunch of times.
---
Terrible. I love it.
---
I'm a paladin, have been a paladin since TBC, I love them through a mid through, this isn't to decide whether I'll be playing them or not haha I'm just doing some serious damage now and it feels like everyone is wrong about their damage
---
Typically to find a group quickly:
---
31+ gy
---
34+ lib
---
36+ arm
---
38+ cath
---
You can of course go a little early but at those levels groups are unlikely to pass on you.
---
More like 
---
Resist, release spirit
---
They are just as bad as gankers.
---
Making people miserable for no other reason than to be a pain.
---
That's exactly what I said, yes.
---
Lmao how many times is this going to be posted...
---
Ferals are getting asked to tank , bcause we ate missing tanks, prots palas are also having a blast because everyone needs tanks while leveling
---
How do you get nights that dark? Mine feels way brighter
---
the 10 man raid xp bug helped I reckon
---
It's not a xenophobia when I live in a slavic country...

Who cares if its got sone nice raw damage, what are you missing out on like 4 agi? 3 stam?

&gt;FIRST TIME PLAYER (coming from Runescape)-

WHAT YEAR IS THIS???
---
Im playing from thailand to eu servers with a constant 300+ping
---
Hi.
---
The reason people here find you repulsive and won‚Äôt argue you is because you are not in line with what this sub represents. The people here wanted classic for the community, the social aspect and the group play. An experience that is worth more than selfish greed. And here you are, trying to argue the exact opposite side of what the people here want.
---
You have a right to have your own opinion, just like you technically have a right to roll need on stuff you don‚Äôt need; the game offers the elements to do so. But there will be a social backlash to your behaviour when it does not follow classic etiquette. So people would rather see you gone than be a toxic representation in classic.
---
Is there any way to increase the chat size? Since there's a lot of spam atm with dungeons, I barely can see what people write since it's such a small standard chat.
---
Not a warrior, but I imagine you hamstring, strafe (sidestep) away while they're slower than you, letting you recharge your very slow swings while they can't hit back.
---
In WC hunter rolled need one hander for my tank and nobody minded so I thought as long as it's an upgrade you can roll so I rolled need on a staff and people sent me death threats even though I actually had higher dps on that staff.
---
It‚Äôs a matter of priority
---
Lol only one of my friends played Scape and literally 15 of my friends hopped on classic when it came out

Prat 3.0
---
Old but gold, sadly for you it was know to be a "Mod hub" along with the "Moderator island" And its actually pretty empty.
---
Oooffff
---
bro it‚Äôs wow
---
Awesome!
---
Classic's slower pace allows things to happen the way they were meant to be.
---
The space goats are coming, the space goats are coming!
---
Do you understand that the game at level 27 and the game in endgame are very different?
---
I think if comes down to your lack of actual buttons to press so you are left waiting for procs while auto attacking
---
I think thats stupid though, its very easy for mages to kill you at low levels before you get your tools. Poly you, freeze pet, blink into your deadzone and kill you.
---
60 is tenfold, 900g.
---
Elem shamans have a lot of counterplay: silence, all kinds of mana drains and so on. And they may rock at the start when everyone has bad gear, but even when people start getting better gear and stack more HP, Elems' viability becomes questionable in PvP. Not saying it's that bad, but clearly not even close to locks, mages and shadow priests.
---
Classic horde lived(s) up to its name
---
How do I git gud at druid pvp? I feel everytime I fight the opposite faction I die miserably. Granted most who jump me are higher level, but I've had some fair-ish fights which I felt I could have won if I wasn't so bad.
---
Nah it's much easier to hit ?? players than you think. Try rushing a ?? warlock with a bunch of rogues and warriors ;p
---
Well of course it takes forever then. Why though. Finding a DPS for any dungeon is usually a matter of a few minutes ü§î
---
Haha I'm glad you enjoyed it mate :)
---
GY is worth at least one run, if Horde you get an easy quest from inside the dungeon. The loot off the rare spawns is mostly good, also.
---
Rouge here, if u want a target to be focused mark it with a skull. I am perfectly capable of offtanking 1 mob
---
Please explain why that would not be the case? There are tons of arguments against what you percieve as "fairness". Your arguments only work in a vacuum where the Axiom is that fair = good, and that gold &gt; gear, which is super easy to pragmatically argue against.
---
Imagine that attitude in a raiding guild. While you could say that by needing and rolling on an item that you can sell, but is an upgraded for another person in the guild, the chance of anyone who needed actually getting the item is "fair", because of an equal chance of rolling the highest between the people who rolled. Is that the *best*outcome, though? the Best outcome, and *gasp*.. Most fair perhaps? Would be to give the item to whoever needs it for upgrades, to further progress raiding - thus in the end securing more items, more gold and more progress, for *everyone* in the guild, instead of the item only benefitting you. Suddenly what's the most "fair" doesn't really matter, and while, by your definition, this system is unfair, it ends up benefitting the *most amount of people*, including you.
---
You need to grund your moral axioms, my dude.
---
Yeah, see, the flaw in your argument is this: you're equating a non-requisite ability to a requisite ability. 
---
Rogues don't have to level up LP - in fact, they have to go out of their way to level it up. They perform their role in the group (DPS, CC) with or without LP.  Compare this to literally any other skill you've mentioned. Those are purchased with the currency the player comes by naturally over the course of the leveling and gearing process - you're attempting to make a 1:1 comparison where it is not possible.
---
You want to know where comparisons are possible? Gathering skills. You're not entitled to the node in the instance if you don't have mining. You're not entitled to the herbs in the instance if you don't have herbalism. You're not entitled to the leather if you don't have skinning. You're not entitled to the locked chest if you don't have a way to open it.
---
You're not enti- oh, wait, maybe you are since you're trying to justify your 'right' to something you elected not to be able to do for yourself. 
---
Having sufficient LP skill isn't part of the playing the class, stop trying to justify your entitlement.
---
Hahaha :) too true!
---
Firstly what level are you?
---
How do you counter that at high levels though?
---
South Park episode just playing out technically. Can we get boar simulator in meantime?
---
Not at ~35, i would argue the rogue needs it more since your not getting most of your damage from auto attack like they are
---
Lul? What are you talking about? Random streamer zergs ragnaros with a bunch of underleveled/undergeared people.
---
What's the point in effort?
---
Dagger/Shield is better until 40. After that, it probably comes down to gear (but 2h will likely be stronger)
---
Microwaves can disrupt your wireless signal. They operate around 2.4 GHz, which is the same frequency as a wireless router signal. Unless you use 5 GHz on your router, then microwaves won‚Äôt be a problem.
---
Haha, I'm sure it will :D
---
Thanks guys! And have you seen this working in action?
---
Will I be able to kill them as leather equipped arms warrior?
---
That was rhetorical sarcasm my dude.
---
All classes have moments of strengths and fun and some chores or water to carry (or in the case of a mage, conjure lots of).  A rogue has to level lockpicking, but gets to stealth and pick their fights, be great in pvp, etc.  A mage has to conjure a lot of water, but has a hugely versatile kit.  A paladin has to buff a lot, but sees it strengthen their party significantly, etc.  
---
I don't see the other classes thinking their particular tediums entitle them to more of the loot.  If they did, I would disagree with them too.
---
I'm not arguing for greed, greed doesn't exist in a system where everything is distributed evenly.   No one has the option to ninja something.  It also promotes good server economy by not encouraging people to equip gear they'd rather sell just because of an archaic social custom
---
Never happens to horde
---
What a strange skinny orc
---
Yeah ive heard about thier mana usage.
---
is it as bad in endgame as well? im thinking in boss fight, if the mana drains fast then how would one keep mana for the entire fight? or is more like they can go for an entire fight but not much more then that, so just dring inbetween every fight? depending on gear ofc.
---
the questline in retail for silverpine is way better than classic silverpine imo
---
Well, I guess I can only hope he's destitute for the rest of his life after prison then.
---
Just imagine playing pve over pvp üòÇ
---
Get your gear and gtfo
---
Thanks ill look into it later.
---
Gamers. The most oppressed group of all.

How come I have 41 talent points to spend on my pet but no talents to spend it on? Yes I know about the pet trainer next to the Hunter trainer.

Should i suggest using multy action bar and just switching the pages , or using clique type addon for healing like most sane people do ?

---
Yep but I assumed the healer is the one doing the MC so theres not a high dps loss but still halving the amount of dmg the tank is taking :P
---
wow nice high quality facebook boomer GIF meme!!! this sub ROCKS
---
Are you saying shamans can heal dungeosn fine with a hybrid ele/resto spec in lvl 60? or did i maybe misunderstand?
---
&gt;and that gold &gt; gear, 
---
False. Gold=gear is the entire premise of my argument.  The boe can be bought for gold the boe can be sold for gold.   They are interchangeable and equal.
---
I'm kind of unclear why they chose to wait on the keyring - just to kind of a little bit make power leveling a tiny bit more inconvenient i suppose? But yeah, confirmed for first patch.
---
I'm sure the term "economy" is just completely arcane to you
---
I actually find it nice to mix questing with cleave dungeons. I wanna do it all and not exclude any type of gaming. Only problem is Im a warrior and have yet to tank properly cause frankly its not needed. Im lvl 43
---
Spent all day yesterday leveling and waving at alliance players. Not a single one got rowdy and wanted to fight. : /
---
Guess we all are eager to make it 60.
---
Your rotation doesn‚Äôt have enough in it to keep up with other dps so it‚Äôs not that they can‚Äôt do it it‚Äôs the rack they just are not that good in raids( plus pally healers are gods)
---
not a scamm, its a price the low levels could afford ontop of the chance to maybe get stuff for an alt, and if you decide not to make it you have all that free loot (if you chose to take it) to sell on the AH
---
Nope, in redridge. Sorry :(
---
We can still be friends tho
---
You're comparing a deadly terrorist attack with industrial sabotage
---
Manmode. 2hander spamming Demo Shout and Cleave/Sweeping Strikes/WW. Prot spec actually hurts you because your rage generation is proportional to you damage taken. **As long as your healer is on the same page** then 2h Arms is "best".
---
Deep Prot is only "required" for the MT in 40m raids.
---
That being said, if you're more comfortable tanking Prot SwordnBoard (Arms with a Sword and Shield is good too) that's fine, but generally survivability in leveling dungeons isn't nearly as much an issue as holding threat is, and Arms Cleave is the solution to that.
---
how was i sarcastic back to the GM? His rank is literally GM.. do you know what that stands for "Guild Master" .... where do you sense sarcasm...  I didn't even say "yes master" in quotations.. which would have implied sarcasm..
---
Also, grind half a level one in a while. There are great lists online of grinding spots for each level
---
That was like best campaign in w3. I hope it will be in Reforged too.
---
Don‚Äôt you mean hearth breaking
---
I'm very grateful for it. Great way to kill time during a 10 hour shift and a slow night
---
I'm working on getting exalted for the full 20% discount. Applies to class training as well, you know.
---
WC is one of my favorite dungeons; there's a huge nostalgia factor there though I admit. Years of re-rolling horde characters and doing WC many times will do that to you
---
should be the same as your right+click function, doesn't that work for auto shot?
---
When you FD, can the pet also drop agro or he just take a beatin till he's dead, I feel remorse every time.
---
I still remember very clearly when Cata released, while the expansion is very hit or miss for most, I feel like it did one thing right. It created a villain that gave a true emotional response, Deathwing destroying the world I had come to love - forever changing (or in some case ruining) zones I had become attached to and had so many memories in, it felt so much more impactful then just "go kill this guy because we said so".
---
Blessed be
---
his response to me on my comment really sealed the deal
---
Skullflame is quite balanced
---
Was running through a zone on my hunter and had a guy ask me why I didn't buff him back when we crossed paths..
---
\&gt;.&lt;
---
feral tanks are the best tanks for 5-men dungeons,and they are quite decent offtanks in MC and BWL. But there is only one single usecase for bringing a bear over a war: DPS race fights like Vael. In all other cases prot wars in tier sets are considerably better.
---
It's not more fair, the people who can use it getting to roll need on it is fair BECAUSE THAT'S THE POINT OF DOING THE FUCKING DUNGEONS, getting upgrades. 
---
It's not better. It's only better for YOU, if you're a selfish fuck who wants to keep someone in the group (who looted the damn thing) from using it, because you just want a shot at selling it.
---
It's not merely *how I want to use the rolls* (though I obviously agree with how it is). That's how they were intended to be used. You want to, effectively, STOP using the GREED roll altogether, with everyone rolling NEED on everything. Which makes no sense (unless you're a selfish ninja looter, in which case I guess it makes total sense).
---
A 12 slot dropped for me yesterday in Northern STV cave. This happened after I rolled 100 for a chest that had bread and a grey sword.
---
Sometimes luck takes time.
---
You do you but man thats hell of a grind
---
You knew what you were doing mate... Lets not play pretend here. 
---
You acted a bit of bell end, probably not for the first time, then you got kicked. Is what it is. Ôøº
---
Some experiments in specs by Melderon led to the conclusion that after level 40 elemental is slightly faster grinding than 1h/shield enhancement, and both are slightly faster than 2h enhancement. Maybe a minute per 20 mob difference between the 3 specs.
---
They mean, once their character dings 60 it's coming after that druid for a 1v1
---
I'm 39,but go on.
---
Yep. Really makes me long for a time when politics was boring.
---
My wife and I were playing on US Sulfuras all night with no issues. Sorry to hear others couldn‚Äôt do the same.
---
Good post and makes me wonder if I should have given the post-Cata zones the benefit of doubt, instead of basically avoiding the new versions of them after it (not including capital cities)...
---
Doesn't the target get constant resistance checks to break sheep early? Anyway, you should be able to get mobs that show the total duration, but it wouldn't affect anything else.
---
I‚Äôm actually in my late 20a, regardless I can‚Äôt bring myself to watch a stream. Too many cringey personalities. IMO most hardcore fans are in the 10-17 range. The same audience that watches reaction videos on YouTube.
---
Here‚Äôs a snippet of something I saw in barrens chat last night:
---
‚ÄúA: You know who helped make Trump his millions?‚Äù  
---
‚ÄúB: darkies?‚Äù
---
Barrens chat is getting worse every day.
---
heal as an enhancement, its funny how easily one forgets that spec wasnt always a problem back in classic. So in the span of 1-55 enhancement is fine for healing in dungeons?
---
Do warriors die more or something
---
Reason why ret rarely exists in endgame is because the rely on auto attacks, seals, and judgement. When judgement eats your seal you have to reapply it. That's your rotation. I'm not saying it's bad persay but ret, along with enhancement shamans, are at the bottom of the totem pole for dps as we pay the hybrid tax.
---
Hilarious! Great job..
---
I‚Äôm leveling holy paladin and there‚Äôs hardly been any gear it‚Äôs all been port gear...
---
In bgs at *every* gear level ele/resto is the best shaman spec..
---
On the other hand, shadow is *never* the best priest spec for bgs - it's not bad, just not the best option.
---
I specifically remember when they added a FP to the rebel camp in TBC. Talk about a qol upgrade.
---
Uhh... No
---
I'd say go for it! There's a lot of interesting stuff to see, and now that you have the old zones to go back to, maybe your mind will be a little more open to the changes :D
---
Imagine playing a 15 year old game
---
Considering I've done nearly every quest in the game in the past, I'm not looking to read the story lines once again. I'm ok with using add-ons to aid quest completion so I can do what I want to do in the game- PvP
---
Yup, i agree it is one of the best after replaying it and seeing how much it influenced games around that era on top of being fun.  But 12 year old me was like wtf why is there no orc campaign I want an army.
---
That a boy!
---
Every method of gold farming I've found has crashed. What can I do to make 50 more gold for my mount? Warrior btw
---
I need it to be left of key "1" for my optimal configuration
---
I find your lack of mouse-mat and back support disturbing.
---
Probably just needed it for a quest /shrug
---
This.... This changes everything.
---
Kinda like damn shift's over already?
---
I really expected this game to be toxic AF, just a lot different from how it was back then. But to be honest, it's one of the best community experiences I've had in any game. Love it
---
If it bothers you you can se /dnd I believe it makes impossible for non friends to /w you.
---
I use threat plates.
---
You know something that might do you good to learn...When you think everyone else is the problem, YOU are the actual problem.It's funny you say people have not had any actual argument and only been insulted.Maybe you can't read very well but people have had actuals arguments against it, you come off as an extreme narcissist...The ONLY THING "100% indisputable" is that you are in the wrong as is obviously stated by the vote of this thread...your "logic" goes out the window when the vast majority of the playerbase disagrees...
---
Git gud then
---
Gold can be used to.purchase upgrades for any class while at the same time the person who lost the roll ans wanted to wear it can use gold to purchase the item they didn't win the roll on.
---
I keep hearing people like you talk about shamans or pallies as having ‚Äúmana issues in classic‚Äù. In classic, if your class has mana and you pvp ‚Äî you have mana issues. The same goes for mages and hunters. If you‚Äôre good and maximize your downtime with utility usage and min maxing spells, you‚Äôre gunna have mana problems. 
---
some of the best pvp classes are hybrids: ele, shadow, and a enh (if you‚Äôre feeling lucky). 
---
This whole post is set in an unneeded tone of condescension and over dramatic.
---
Yes, unlock window, bottom right can expand
---
Do you know what shamans have absolutely no chance against winning?
---
Being put in a stun lock by a rogue. I have tested this out on pservers at end level in full gear, and on tauren shaman, i hated life fighting rogues. They would stun lock and i would die. Regardless if i had all my essential totems up or not. 
---
You know what is really OP? Orc racial. 25% stun resist is 50% of at least ONE stun resisting which will break the stun lock. And they dont just stun twice. They stun 4 times in a fight. The first cheap, kidney shot. Then blind. And cheap, kidney shot again. That is 4 chances of you resisting. About 90% chance of standing a chance vs rogues as a shaman if you played orc. 8% chance any other race.
---
Now you know who also stuns?  Warrior charges, hunter concussion, destro warlocks, shadow priest blackouts, pally, druids,
---
It used to persist with shapeshifting in Vanilla, though many of the animations still played as animal form ones. So you could be a skeleton who would have a bear burst out of you every time you mauled. Blizzard changed this at some point.
---
Weak auras
---
Desk.
---
Get one.
---
Imagine thinking majority matters to logic and facts.   LOL that's the most pleb thing I've ever heard holy shit
---
Doesn't work on classic, besides I am Warrior so I need rage before I can cast something.
---
&gt;What kind of low life loser would literally ruin the fun for everyone looking forward to this?
---
The same people who gank others over and over for fun.
---
I use weakaura2 classic , works fine with my warlock
---
if hes going to get kicked for being sarcastic with someone then that person needs to go outside and take wow less seriously
---
Lol EU realm went down and we got 0. 
---
Par for the course really
---
I didn't climb anything, I was on a fly between Auberdine and Nigel's Point, got disconnected, when I logged back I found myself falling short distance on the ground and I landed near the ruins.
---
That would actually be Iron Hammer.
---
There is a little vertical bar on your xp bar. When your xp hits that bar you're back to normal xp gain. The longer you rest, the farther the bar goes.
---
I put comments with each of the pictures, but a quick summary here: Yesterday the DDOS disconnect occurred while  was on a flight to Loch Modan. When I logged in this morning my gryphon had apparently abandoned me and I was falling from the sky, but luckily landed in the mountains. I noticed I was in a location you typically wouldn't be able to get to and though I would explore the mountain tops a bit, ending up finding some pretty interesting locales.
---
You'd be surprised how many people do actually say, "The Alliance are all cowards". 
---
Bruh. You must be 100% immersed right now.
---
Yeah, I agree. Rare BoE's can make you a lot of money. In my opinion, that is just as valid of a reason to roll on it as somebody that its an upgrade for and is going to wear it for like 10 levels in the absolute best case scenario, but more likely its only an upgrade for a few levels.
---
Ye that makes sense, I forgot about extra damaging skills... I thought my big Phat crits would be enough to keep up, stacking agi and str and I'm getting some really big numbers, I thought I'd he able to apply this to my level 60 self and still hit big and come out big at the end
---

---
Rogues and friends of rogues ask for clothies and warriors (tanks, usually) so they don't have roll against other leather wearers or hunters looking for stat sticks :P
---
Is that Asmongold?
---
Why are the Spanish so insufferable?....
---
Actually experience a zone again, so many things just work as intended.
---
/bows to classic
---
People did logout or use /camp to do that
---
What have you done to "help" as you call it? Where's your fundraiser? How much have you "donated" so far? Nowhere and nothing, because all you did was make a failtroll shitpost on Reddit. XD
---
Probably won't have it until I'm looking at the epic mount. But by then it'll *really* matter, so.
---
The other two commenters have given the reason, but more specifically casting while not facing the target is a great bonus also. When you are leveling and running from place to place you can cast corruption and agony on a target, have you VW attack it to get initial aggro and then run away while the dots tick, they mob will follow you and you can refresh the dots without ever looking at your target. It will chase because you have been dealing damgae to it and it will die usually without ever touching you and doing very little damage to your VW or consuming much mana. For this 5/5 is amazing.
---
I don't think you get the concept of sarcasm either
---
Yeah, it's not black and white. You just like to feel morally superior.
---
I cant wait till phase 2.
---
That is a fair point.
---
These people should still be shamed though.
---
Warrior whirlwind axe quest. Good job!
---
damn... thought the player base was more mature
---
Billy big balls here.
---
Its a reclaimed slur at this point, where people now identify with it
---
I don't have a full grasp in the situation, and they could easily just be bad apples in the community, which happens with any community. 
---
But one thing that is startling clear in Classic; DPS is secondary to *not grabbing threat*. 
---
Just clear the experience from your mind, and move on. Learn from it, if you can.
---
that's because people don't have gold right now... around P3 this will prob go 3-500 depending on server.
---
They sell for 4g on Skeram
---
Other than Labor Day weekend, I‚Äôve played everyday since release. I haven‚Äôt lagged at all except for yesterday during the ddos attack. And I really like how you say the last five days have been super laggy and are now changing to the first five days were super laggy, but I‚Äôm not gonna get into that.
---
Just because you‚Äôre experiencing something doesn‚Äôt mean that everyone is or that everyone who isn‚Äôt is a liar.
---
Most pvp servers are close to 60 40, which just means horde are likely to have way bigger bg queues.
---
If you want to go ally id say this is a huge benefit to you, rather than a disadvantage.
---
this is so fucking annoying
---
The difference is that you will do lower DPS with a fast mainhand than a slow one.
---
I was telling my wife earlier. You have to give people the chance to be assholes so you can learn who the good folk are.
---
well if you have a plan and minmax every quest its no journey, just work to lvl60. But if you dont look up guides and just play, its a lot more fun and challenging, especially if you do quests above your level.
---
I now do this too.
---
Rofl yeah there are noobs out there that said "I'm going to play a Balance druid"... no they don't even have the concept of a 'balance druid'. They just said, "I'm going to play a druid".
---
Why do people like making doomsday predictions? Boredom?
---
big cringe
---
Yeah have fun clicking soc and sor then swinging your pool noodle at people from level 5 to level 60
---
Yeah they think they're elite hackers because they can run a few scripts and have enough benefit money to rent a botnet. I hope they enjoy being worn like a surgical glove in prison, blizzard takes cyber attacks extremely seriously and have shown in the past they will go to a lot of effort to see attackers go to jail for a long time.
---
One of them is healbot by the looks of it, probably doesnt always use healbot....
---
but with the fun removed
---
Same. I dread this daily.
---
The most recent one was Kawaizombie.
---
Mine is swamped with "ded relm" memes
---
Hey I'm sure he has a table or desk he uses, some times I wanna lay in bed or sit on the couch when I'm just mindlessly grinding.
---
People don't play to be 100% logical, they play to have fun. The fact is, most people feel better when they find a good boe upgrade vs just buying one off the AH. I like to try and enhance other people's fun, and hope they do the same for me. It's that community aspect that everyone loves about classic.
---
WC is the only dungeon so far that I've had wipes in. This dungeon is rough.
---
Hey, yeah fair enough, just wanted clarification on the threat part, not really sure what it means
---
You can get the 300 fishing quest at 35.
---
They just dont make the raids like they used to, southshore vs tarren Mill, thats what its all about *sips* not these cookiecutter 35warrior 5 shaman MCs.
---
Was on deviate delight yep
---
Oh nevermind gotcha hahaha
---
Jokes on them since Alliance have the most powerful PvP racial: Paladins.
---
Cant buy the powder, you make it from Fadeleaf.
---
Mage question regarding AoE grinding. Do any of you use flamestrike in the rotation?
---
I sure hope no one is putting themselves the hell of levelling a warrior because they think the meta matters in a game where you can down raids with all druids, and you‚Äôll often rather bring a hybrid than a pure DPS because their off heals/tanking/supporting helps more than pure damage.
---
Vanilla wasn‚Äôt hard because of content, it was hard because getting 40 people together consistently three days a week for 2 years is a fucking crazy achievement.
---
What‚Äôs worse is that with this many warriors it‚Äôll be hard to gear one because there is so much competition that most people won‚Äôt even be able to enter raids. Mean while your hunter friend will be the sole hunter in a raid picking up all the hunter epics.
---
On the other hand, if people actually like warriors then they should play warriors. I just hope there aren‚Äôt any would be balance druids who are going to regret playing the meta when their servers best balance Druid owns them in pvp.
---
You just didn't notice it when you were younger. Politics have never been boring
---
Your the asshole here, not the GM...
---
11 agility is going to be noticeable, yes. More crits and higher damage generally.
---
He's best off getting to level 10, completing his starter zone and then running over to meet you guys. You can start playing together anytime, but obviously he's going to need to catc up in levels.
---
He should be doing his starter zone though to at least start getting some reputation with his faction out of the way.
---
4 people including myself resubbed
---
BfA players angry that everyone playing Classic ;)
---
Intentional griefing of your own faction isn't being a rival.
---
Try going to tarren mill
---
Added later on for some catch up gear, they come in a later phase.
---
"i can sell it though"  Yeah... so everubodu can need for everything? I hate people like this
---
Man it‚Äôs a common argument, I‚Äôm completely on your side.
---
It ALWAYS seems like the people who think BOEs shouldn‚Äôt be needed on, are bad/casual/new players who don‚Äôt understand how the economy works.
---
Poo Blood Brothers!
---
Yes, like me. I hate retail but love classic.
---
Reddit is trash. I disagree with you because I put value on using an item over getting money, but the amount of people just insulting you and going way over the top is fucking ridiculous. You have a fair point.
---
You can read everything so clearly. Honestly the complaints are so much more annoying.
---
They're looking for AOE. Can someone please tell them it's not illegal to mix melee and spell aoe.
---
Poly isn't a factor most times because of how many crap mages there are. Good luck getting a poly off while being feared from a lock or attacked by Hunter. I'm just saying. It's not a flat out 100% guarantee mage will wreck you. :) Just have to play it smart.

Blaumeux. Toxic is the largest guild full of tweens and fortniters

You must make the group when you can't enter one.
---
9 dungeon runs so far, all 9 with great groups. I'm starting to think I'm blessed.
---
yeah my bad.
---
Wait people are pugging MC already?!
---
GY:28 lowest desired 30
---
Lib: 32+, arm: 34+, cath 36 min for healers only... really should do 38 on every role
---
It‚Äôs just a ton of people who don‚Äôt understand that any boe is worth gold, which is equally useful to everyone.
---
When I played vanilla private servers I went to Badlands to farm elemental earth dropping from rock elementals at 11% but I don't know how well they are sold in classic. I think I could get a could sell them for around 50s a piece in AH back then.
---
I will say though, she followed me to Orgrimmar. That determination was impressive.
---
Still more enjoyable than listening to a snakeoil salesman with superiority complexes. Look at Mr. Professional here, telling other people to learn how to use a computer and then start suggesting executing some obscure program he wrote which will 'magically' boost WoW FPS. Blizzard developers hate him!
---
You're right though about Ryzen, that was the CPU and Radeon the graphics card. Got that messed up after not caring for AMD since a decade.
---
The problem is not the value, as so many are trying to incorrectly argue.  The problem is that your method here, your logical reduction, is breaking a long established social norm.  A social contract that‚Äôs been in place since the beginning.
---
Predators regularly kill prey for ‚Äúresources.‚Äù  We look at them and say that‚Äôs completely natural.  Circle of life.  So why then, as humans, am I forbidden to kill you for the resources I need?  Because we have established social contracts that allow us to live in a society.  It doesn‚Äôt make sense; it‚Äôs completely unnatural.  It‚Äôs illogical.
---
Basically, you‚Äôre ability to easily justify this, your lack of empathy, your ability to overlook the social etiquette of the situation ... are you slightly psychopathic?  You might want to see someone.
---
The Spy addon is reading combat log. Just like Details or Recount are to measure damage/healing. I'n fact I'm sure Details could be set up to notify you of stealth users using stealth around you. After all it tracks the use of all spells cast by anyone within your combat log range.
---
That's a very greedy way to look at things. If a BoE drops and it's an upgrade for someone then they get it, you have other options to make gold.
---
Apart from what other mentioned, theres also some quests in Southshore for alterac mountains, thats suits people in 30-35 range.
---
I jumped between stv, hillsbrad then moved over to arathi / stv.
---
Theres also some quests in booty bay for upper stv. Troll ears quest, basilisk quest, and goblin gem quest which suits some one araubd 32-36 :)
---
I realized it myself not so long ago. After a few years of not playing the game.
---
Phone is the easiest. On the reddit app you just create topic, take the pic and done. You can read it what's the issue?
---
How did you get to theramore isle at level 12?

---
Pets is perfectly normal and it's actually fairly rare for people to call them minions.
---
1/98 would imply that theres a specific number youre trying to roll for. 98/100 means there 98 possible numbers that can be rolled
---
Not enough people are in it. Will see tons of LFM in lookingforgroup, but then in the dungeon zones local you see tons of LFGs.
---
I am not tank and I applaud you for tanking, there is lots of wow classic videos of how to play each class in each dungeon etc, would recommend to review youtube vids prior to going in without a premade of friends.
---
have fun, review basic rotation for threat etc.
---
Any chance you could link it? üòä
---
 YouTube dude. I don‚Äôt think you can get better guide than that. Plus you can search for your specific class, you didn‚Äôt mention what it was.
---
Edit: I didn‚Äôt think you may not want spoilers. In that case tell people what your class is.
---
Casually walking around with a severed head in your backpack.  
---
As you do.
---
No, frost spec is meta for AoE. There's not enough benefit for the mana usage.
---
Go to desolace as soon as you are able and do the repeated fishing quest in Shadowprey village. 55s for every 5 lobster things in cages.  The respawn on the cages is pretty decent so even if a few ppl are farming you won't have much competition. Just don't tell too many ppl about it.
---
Now it‚Äôs Joe Rogan and Donald Trump
---
Goos thing about classic is that his name is fucked on that realm now. No guild or group would want him if you spread the word.
---
wtf i literally got to level 20 on opening night without having a single bag drop.  I was using the fucking 4 slot bag from old blanchy for fucks sake.  Had to buy some 6 slotters from the general goods vendor :(
---
I can only recommend my own server which is Zandalar Tribe RP PvP. Cause it's the only RP PvP server you don't need to worry about it ever being dead. Also cause it's RP the queues are very forgiving. I feel that it's one of the best of both worlds because it's a high pop realm and the worst queue I had was 1.5 hours at peak time on day 2. No queues since then.  RP Servers also tend to attract a more mature players in general, most "squeakers" or immature players won't go on RP because RP = lame apparently. 
---
Also, just little things. Like if you say "LF1M DPS for deadmines" most people on non RP Servers just message "inv" which I fucking hate. On RP you are much more likely to get a whisper saying "Hi, I am a DPS, can I join?" Which to me makes a big difference
---
Safe to say I'd say if there is a Slavic community they keep to themselves.
---
Im glad horde have this problem somewhere, always seemd to be them killing me on my server :D
---
Was it 4str 4 stam?
---
Um I'm not sure about that one
---
Not really worth the risk of losing the slow from blizzard imo, and even when they‚Äôre nova‚Äôed the shatter crits from blizzard are definitely better/more consistent dmg overall
---
He moved in tbc to his home.
---
That's great stuff, but I have a question, stay in bear form in pvp, not cat form? Damage seems low. Is that also true with casters who go through your armor?
---
Something minor happened today, ***off to reddit***.
---
So for me I just haven't really figured out a better way. I'm not serious about wow and just want a casual leveling experience. I don't have a desk and will be playing from my living room so I don't really want to balance a keyboard on my lap and play.
---
Just start with something simple, like Ragefire Chasm (your flair is Horde, so I assume that'll be your first instance). And like the others said, just check Youtube for some demos
---
You mean RFD not RFK
---
If the dagger is even a 5 dps increase over the rogue's previous dagger he will get MUCH MORE damage out of it than a caster will with the meager caster stats provided.
---
You talk about priority, but upgrades are relative. A rogue absolutely can benefit more from a "caster" dagger. The dps is a melee "stat" that a caster isn't making any use of, yet you are completely ignoring that.
---
This is classic, there can be strange stat spreads on items that benefit classes that you wouldn't expect. There are many staves in the game that benefit warriors more than spellcasters.
---
You are the type of person I would never want to interact with in-game because you are clearly extremely stubborn and narrow-minded. You are the type of person to NEVER think outside of the box you put yourself in.
---
Absolutely hate gnomes unfortunately. I'd just go dwarf/human if it were only about racials.
---
Friend told me his level
---
Nobody cares
---
I think a good proportion is just kids being edgy.
---
How did you make so much moolala.
---
Grats btw
---
I will, thanks! :)
---
Makes it Al that more entertaining when I'm Poppin big phat numbers of 300 odd critical hits
---
"The Art team have been hard at work with a totally option HD texture pack" $15
---
Why Dwarf? 
---
And what makes you love Druid and Mage? If you like the versatility of the Druid, Paladin might be a good option. If you like the ranged aspect of the Mage, (Shadow) Priest might be a good option. They can both be Dwarves.
---
I think this was a reference to the old gods.  But that might have been the kids in stormwind
---
I feel bad you are getting attacked for this, I 100% agree with you.
---
BOP: Need if you use it, Greed to sell.
---
BOE: Everyone needs. If you want to use it, you forfeit the AH money you could have made from selling it. If you can't use it, you can sell it and buy an equivalent BOE for your class. Everyone in the party gets a chance for a BOE, and no chance of ninja.
---
I press shadow bolt.
---
It has enough range for you to freeze them before they can hit you
---
Because 3 horde races start nearby, and pretty much everyone goes to The Barrens to level. It‚Äôs a logical next step for 90% of the hordes I guess.
---
I can‚Äôt remember too well, but I also think it‚Äôs a decent zone to level.
---
Molten core was cleared in all greens, ubrs can probably be done with no gear on
---
Hi, I am playing warrior and getting into lv20s now.
---
I heard about attack bar timer addon but the Samuel one won't work for me.
---
I used /sam to try to activate it but each command that I type works properly, except the most importnat one: /sam activate
---
It just won't work. I can type it in the chat, but when I press enter, nothing happens, it's like stuck. I can't type it in chat and enter just won't work like it's locked. I also tried unlocking the bar, but activate then tells me to lock the bar first.
---
I have no idea how to fix it so getting a working attack timer bar is something I am looking for.
---
Any recommendations?
---
The night got alot more interesting!
---
this is what we mortals call out of body experience
---
It's not "100% fair", dude. You calling it that doesn't make it so.
---
You're right, everyone does it is not an argument. But everyone does do it, *because it makes the most sense*. Based on the principle and obvious fact that the purpose of doing the dungeons/raids is to get upgrades. That's the first principle. And the second principle is you only get to to roll on things that 1) you can use *at all*, and 2)  that are upgrades. 
---
The fact that some items are BoE, is meaningless to those first principles. And to suggest that those principles are not valid would be to undermine the whole system. Meaning that is everyone rolls need on EVERYTHING, you'd have clothies rolling need on plates and robes rolling need on 2-handed maces... And everyone would be FAR worse off.
---
This way, everyone is better off. Because when something drops that at least one person can use, someone in the group gets it (to use on their character). In your proposed system, someone outside the group would be getting some of these items, and generally the group would be not so *better off* because you'd have more things not going to the group.
---
And of course if something is only a (technically) minor upgrade, someone who *can* roll need, can instead opt to roll greed on it, and chance winning it so they can sell like everyone else.
---
But you're trying to remove that choice from them, from people who are used to that choice... from actually getting to use an item the group looted.
---
Can I tell you what I suspect your main problem is? My hunch is that you are not very comfortable with confrontation or non-anonymous conflict (reddit fights are anonymous), so when someone wins a valuable item in a pug, you dont have the nerve to ask them to equip. To keep them honest. So it *burns you inside* thinking that some rolled need... and now they're going to sell it.. tHaT BaStArD NiNjA LoOter! 
---
So your system would be a perfect fix for you. You don't ever have to confront anyone. And you don't ever have to wonder if someone screwed you over. Because everyone rolls need on everything.
---
But that's not what's best for the individuals of the group, most of which who actually want to use the loots the group get... *so get some balls* and just get used to the idea that if someone rolls need on a tradable item, and it's of any moderate or higher value, you will just ask they equip it. You can inspect them at first to check. But if they haven't, then yes, you might need to keep them honest. That's how ninja looting is PREVENTED, in the system *I* claim to be the best possible system.
---
But only if you're not afraid to speak up, and prevent ninja looters from getting away with shit.
---
Do you drive a minivan and ask for the manager a lot?
---
Kind of me yesterday
---
Some huntard came and shot me when I was under half health, with a dead pet and almost no mana. So I feared him to a murlocy death. Felt great
---
Between those two, I would 100% recommend human. Rogue gear looks awful on dwarves to me
---
Civil suit? Sure
---
Jail time? Fuck that. No one deserves to be locked in a cage for that
---

---
Lore-wise that's exactly what Gnomer is. It WAS the capitol city of the Gnomes. Until the Trogg invasion.
---
Get the 10 slot bags for 30s. Best bang for your buck.
---
Grid2 for life baby!
---
What a load of crap.
---
There are quite a few quests all over Ashenvale, and some grinding spots. It's quite often a recommended place to go after your initial run in the barrens.
---
Ahhhhh a cleft lip!!! Mind blown
---
This is because those of us in our 30s grew up when personal computers were the new big thing. I still remember getting our first computer when I was in 3rd grade. We grew up along with that technology. Kids today are growing up with cell phone technology. So that is what they are drawn to.
---
Whitemane should have a pretty close ratio.
---
I played WotLK when it first came out, no more friends to play with though. Game worth as a solo?
---
Psychic scream isn't worth it imo. If there are more than two people in melee range worth fearing I'm likely dead anyway.
---
But that applies to any drop you can roll on. I could use the same line of reasoning to roll need on everything and vendor it. Then the greed and need button use their purpose.
---
Raids at 60 basically.
---
In reality the only thing prot tree does for you is A: increases your threat and B: increases survivability. Former is shallow in the tree, so arms/fury warriors can pick them up, going deeper would be best for endgame if you know you are going tank for good.
---
My fury warrior friend has been tanking for me at 60 for a while now, not many issues other than when we started LBRS, he was still wearing mail from SM.
---
Mileage may vary, for less coordinated groups or newer tanks, when you are reaching BRD/LBRS and beyond, go prot.
---
Thank you for thinking with me bro!
---
Dwarves are just super cool to me. Friendly beer drinkers that look hilarious, and they know it. Everytime I play something else I just wish I was playing a dwarf.
---
I love druids for their versatility indeed; being almost unkillable and super fast. Good raiding times with HoTS. I like mages because they‚Äôre just simple. They slow, can blink, make their own stuff. They‚Äôre just super convenient.
---
As for classes that dwarves can play - a priest seems a good option, but the many buttons scare me lol :(
---
Yup, I made a meme I thought was hilarious, but because I didn't photoshop it to make it look like it was WoW related it got removed. I sent modmail asking why that was even a rule since funny "low effort" things were being removed while hot garbage was being spammed everywhere (Threx memes). 
---
The only response they gave me was "see the rule" it's a general piece of shit one that they use to decide what does or does not get posted as far as memes go.
---
NOOO I took the mace just because it was worth more silver
---
Why ppl think this game is a sprint race?
---
Grats from a lvl 19 druid fishing just outside crossroads.
---
Human is the best for PvE, because of their increased skill in Swords. If your focus is on PvP, Gnome is your best option. Their racial ability Escape Artist is amazing.
---
I wanna know how he dinged 60 and had the gold to get epic mount at the same time. So I care. You‚Äôre statement is invalid.
---
Yeah, Stoneform would be nice but I'd be happy with Perception/weapon skill. Plate looks better on dwarves, imo.
---
Check post history. It's a bot trying to sound human.
---
It was bound to happen. Fire and any trees are a bad idea.
---
Download a threat addon, maintain threat on everything, turn it so the back is exposed, dont give your back to mobs and take it slow if your team are dickheads
---
This sounds great! Have you implemented a role selection yet?
---
\- Relax, it's very hard to completely fuck it up.
---
\- Be aware of your surroundings, patrolling mobs or other groups close by.
---
\- Be aware of your healers mana (give him time to drink).
---
\- Ranged mobs don't come to you, so gather melees and take them to the ranged mob or let a mage sheep the ranged mob. Rogues can also sap humanoid targets. Ranged mobs have mana bars.
---
\- Bind raid target icons to keys. I have skull F5, cross F6 and so on. Skull signals your group to attack that target first. Moon is usually used for sheeps. But talk to your group about what you want sheeped or sapped.
---
\- Use sunder armor. Don't use heroic strike. If tanking groups try to get one stack of sunder armor on all mobs.
---
\- You will lose aggro. That's not your fault. Spot the target back and apply more stacks of sunder armor.
---
There is a good case against TBC.  This is not it.
---
No one wants dungeon finder in classic especially not people on this subreddit
---
So you didn't hear the "You will die" part?
---
Yay, free playtime.
---
There aren't pvp stats in Classic. That wasn't added until BC. Pvp gear in Classic is just high end gear.
---
Preach
---
Dude, if you're lvl 60 with a pulse you'll get an UBRS invite...
---
1) You're probably on a horde dominated server and 2) It's a pretty big quest hub for horde and it's close to the barrens.
---
End up? They have been since day 1.
---
No rolling need doesnt make it soulbound in classic unless its a bind on pickup then you couldnt trade it.
---
This. Love this. I'm a hunter but yeah i can see that the initial burst may be taking the aggro. Makes a whole lot of sense now. Thanks a lot!
---
Good. Don't play on a pvp server if you don't want to pvp.
---
Took most of yesterday half as a break half just doing fun stuff and running lower guildmates through shit.
---
Use a 2h while leveling. Weapon type doesn‚Äôt really matter (nor does human/orc + weapon skill) while leveling until you get deep into the arms tree
---
As a healer, it it douchey to ask an orc tank to stop using his racial ability? I‚Äôm not sure if there is some reason so many are using it because I feel like if I was tanking, I would just take dps hit for less of a chance to die.
---
Neah, my statement holds. You‚Äôre nobody.
---
Might be because of the high grass though.
---
Wow,Level 23 full set from WC, impressive.
---
Yep, you have to enter your role in order to queue. It'll match up 1 tank, 1 healer and 3 DPS for standard dungeons!
---
Gnomebody knows.
---
8 days 9hrs?  dude go outside
---
If you‚Äôre also an alchemist you can run around with extra armor, hp regen, and some bonus health too.
---
Yeah, I think I agree, just can't decide whether male or female.
---
what is the difference?
---
Right you are, I stand corrected.
---
Awesome! I hope this catches on!
---
Somebody works in a hospital
---
LIVE TO WIN!
---
Not douchey at all, tanks shouldn't be worried about their damage.
---
The debuff makes them incredibly hard to heal, and increases the possibility they will die.
---
Back in the day I replaced these on my fury warrior with a pair of level 50 blues.
---
The more I play today, the more I realise how little I understood the game back then.
---
Yeah that was BS.  Made it mandatory to be in a guild if you wanted to buy the new heirlooms and have QoL perks that guild players were going to enjoy.
---
I have a suspicion half the large cesspool guilds were gold making schemes from that perk where a bit of looted money went to the gbank.
---
They never buff the pet though :(
---
It‚Äôs all about that male ponytail life man. The ponytail gives infinite power, facts.
---
You can play 1-60 solo no problem, even while leveling you will meet a ton of people along the way and make new friends.
---
Huh? I haven't bought any gear, let alone any food/water, AT ALL, and I have 10g to my name and I'm level 36. My bank and inventory is full of silk, wool, leather, etc, but stuff doesn't really sell for much yet. How is 100g at level 40 "normal management skills"? 
---
Thank god I'm warlock
---
I didn't!
---
I've been considering alting a priest and this is great info to know!
---
Yeah you'll make new friends along the way
---
We're good.
---
Obviously bind on equip will still be tradable. I meant dungeon drops that are BOP. can't stop ninjas by all rolling need at this point (I suppose if it were crazy good you could try both parties putting in a ticket)
---
If you‚Äôre on Fairbanks horde, I‚Äôll hook you up.
---
I "need" it 
---
For ? 
---
Silver, for what do u need ?
---
My conversation with my ninja friend
---
Hunter is another option. Shoots from range too and is probably easier to play than Priest. They're great for solo play with their pets. 
---
And don't be discouraged by all the buttons. You can slowly incorporate new spells into your gameplay after learning them. By the way, don't Druids also have tons of spells too?
---
Oh look, an SJW on Reddit obsessed with racism.
---
Wow.
---
Its pretty cool how now, when you see someone more succesfull you can just say ‚Äùeh hes layer abusing‚Äù to protect your pixel-based self esteem, rather than admit that youre not putting more hours or brains or just pure luck in to the game
---
Question does you friend own retail WoW? If not he cannot play. It you have to own the base game to play classic.
---
It‚Äôs actually the only thing I miss from retail. Not asking for the system retail has, just an interface to post what you need. I‚Äôm already over spamming a macro into /1 /2 /4 /5.
---
Int is super unimportant while leveling. It doesnt increase smg, nor resting time and you dont oom and become useless after 1 fight (esp as you are wanding).
---
Stam and spirit speed things up more.
---
i'm pretty new to this game, so massive this is stupid, but what is worlddefense? are there space invaders?
---
It's meditative. It takes the speed out of your life, forces you to lay back and chill in a world that has forgotten that it has a break pedal. Deceleration is nice.
---
Meanwhile you still cannot sleep. It's not stressful but absolutely demands some attention. It strikes a perfect balance between BfA World Quests (utterly moronically trivial) and BfA Mythic raids (super stressful)
---
There will be in phase 3.
---
Im already farming devilsaur on my main, each give one leather which sells for 10g each. At an early hour and a good enough time you can easily farm 10-12 an hour coming to about 100 or 120 g per hour. Id have nearly half my gold for an epic mount at this point if I didnt need all the leather for pre bis gear. This is all before im 60
---
IIRC there‚Äôs a two handed mace from Gnomer that is ridiculously good for Druids
---
I would farm beasts for grey/white drops, like the fur tuffs and teeth. Specifically the tigers in swaps of sorrows are nice
---
You better hope Dick Warlock doesn't hit you with the Curse of Thorn.
---
There is one, go speak to an inkeeper.
---
Don't forget that dads with families and jobs that want to relive being edgy.
---
Missing context here but sounds like you won something already and instead of passing so the next person who you compete for loot with gets a drop, you rolled need again.  So no courtesy from your end and he called you out.  Sounds pretty legit to me
---
no you dont lol
---
Paul Stanley - Live to Win
---
Yeah me too... New bro are you some kind of WoW savant?
---
I give people water breathing and lesser invisibility detection. Never know when they might need it.
---
Someone do the math. Probability of drawing 4 uniquely colored bag over the course of an hour and a half assuming 2 kills per minute, so 180 attempts and we'll say use the highest percentage NPC on wowead
---
Healer here: not alone you ain‚Äôt. And I probably DO have enough mana for both of you, but then I have to drink between every pull. That will slow us down a LOT and be very expensive for me. Don‚Äôt do it. Attack what the tank is attacking. 
---
Interface&gt;show target of target
---
Real life obligations? Get a no life dude.
---
Because its the next geographical zone from the barrens where everyone quests.  This is like asking why are there so many alliance in duskwood
---
When I was a kid, I had to get that damn sound blaster working. Remember 
---
    SET BLASTER=A220 I5 D1 H5 P330 E620 T6
---
Nowadays these dang Zoomers couldn‚Äôt set an environment variable if their life depended on it!
---
Come down here and face me, silly dwarf. You are no match for the almighty horde, you are not any taller up there.
---
I understand not wanting the insta port in/out/cross realm thing, but how does a simple interface rather than unreadable spam accross /2 /4 /5 hurt anyone?
---
The guy who made it even notes he's alliance
---
Maybe, but ‚Äújokes‚Äù like that are very rare in other zones I‚Äôve seen, I can‚Äôt wait until I don‚Äôt have to go to the barrens anymore.
---
I don't think it's kids. I play with a bunch of doctors and lawyers and I think the kids are way more mature.
---
Not true, I downloaded just wow classic have never even played wow before classic .
---
The time required to fully gear just doesn‚Äôt compare with bfa. There is no reason to lock yourself in to playing a toon you don‚Äôt want to play.
---
You MOW ON SUNDAY!? MONSTER
---
After everyone reaches level 60 and get raid gears? It's a stupid plan.
---
It's more so to prevent witch hunting. But your reason is valid as well.
---
Your employers are okay with you doing fuck all? lol Never leave that job!!!
---
Mind if I use that as my new phone wallpaper!?
---
Naga stole my bike xDdddddd
---
You realize they don't let you choose the realm you transfer to right? So if you and your friends are on different realms there is a chance you won't get a free transfer to the same realm
---
Classes have different ‚Äúclass quests‚Äù. Shaman class quests are getting their totems. A warlock‚Äôs is getting their minions (and mounts). A hunter‚Äôs only class quest is getting their pet at level 10. For warriors, it‚Äôs getting their 2 stances and gear because they‚Äôre so gear dependent. 
---
The reason people get so excited about getting the whirlwind axe is because it‚Äôs a huge upgrade to the slowest/most difficult class to level/quest as. It‚Äôs the equivalent of you getting your wind totems hit even more so because of the ‚Äúwarrior struggle‚Äù they face questing. They get no speed boost abilities, no free mount, and rely heavily on heroic strike (a basic attack enhancer) until about half way through their leveling experience.
---
Surely it wont work if it attempts to put trap before fd tho?
---
Sting costs a shit load of mana! mana is a valuable resource in vanilla! jk
---
This much social that was made here, was never done in retail.
---
Was this really all you could come up with to show off a new monitor nobody gives a shot about?
---
The first thing I was shocked by is that there is no harbor
---
I'm older than 12 years old so someone has to explain this to me please
---
So what is the exact date it's ok to be 60?
---
Yea like jesus, there's no discernible player imbalance people just loooove anecdotes
---
Haha I'll try send it to him on stream
---
Lets hope this subreddit changes and people dont post screenshots of every insignificant thing someone says.
---
Is this a subreddit for an archive for every message anyone has ever sent?
---
Also as a hunter, there will be a certain amount of discrimination against you. Lol it‚Äôs just a thing but some quick tips.
---
If you have your pet out, make sure your pet taunt is turned off (growl I think it is).
---
Never, ever, right click a mob until the tank starts the pull. And if you are about to jump down a ledge to bypass some stuff, remember to dismiss your pet.
---
You‚Äôre not just joking. I have nightmares about peppa pig and bob the train.
---
Bro is that a bengal? Are they hypoallergenic? I want one so bad.
---
You clever SOB
---
Been in queue for 1 hour (Gahennas eu) and yet it still increases why?
---
Ironic racism is still racism.
---
I mean, just making lfg channel auto join in a new tab on launch would probably help the new players.

Congratulations!!!

[How many times do we have to teach you this lesson, old man?!](https://youtu.be/6SxjBWJPf78)
---
That's funny cause I'd actually want to play a class that was barely played
---
I would love to fish there.
---
Thanks man!
---
Interesting thing about the internet, you can just scroll past the stuff that doesn't interest you...
---
It's Sunday here too but the bigger shops that have alot of shit including lots of IT/electronic stuff are still opened. If you order online on the biggest market place we have in country you can even have the item today in a few hours if it's in stock, they'd just deliver it to you. I do live in the capital city though.
---
Blizzard knows... But they are just a bunch of sneaky rogues
---
If you ask politely in the big city , you usually soon get a few free small bags from people who just upgraded.
---
Key words:  politely and non disturbing way. (no spam!)
---
It's not just one day though it's millions of peoples one day that happens to be a Saturday. Millions of people who pay 15$ a month to enjoy the miniscule amount of free time they get after all of life's other obligations. So really its millions of days. These guys should get their asses royally kicked for this. They should get fucking caned. 
---
Their a symbol of everything wrong with today's youth. Hurting decent people just so they can Garner attention on the interwebs. Oh for the days of old when society actually gave people what they deserved.
---
Praise the sun
---
Yeah I said that in a previous comment, I was joking about how the Horde is alot about honor and tradition and killing lowbies goes against it. Alliance gankers are just as scum
---
The difference is minimal. The biggest upgrade is resolution, but the graphics for the most part are the same except for increased foliage and view distance. Modern wow still uses the same textures in the original continents!
---
You‚Äôd better show how to make a new chat window for LFG so that the normal chat is not bloated üòÖ
---
There are some simple guides on wowhead that I think a new player would be able to understand. I would tell them to read through their spellbook and actually look at their abilities (and make sure they train new spells/ranks at the trainer). Teach them what kiting is. Frostbolt to slow enemy down, as soon as the cast finishes turn and strafe away, cast another frostbolt. When enemies get close frost nova and strafe away or blink. That kinda stuff. Watching videos of more experienced players helped me too.
---
I also really liked Tyler Mane‚Äôs take. Say what you will about Zombie‚Äôs vision, but Mane brought adult Michael to life in a horrifying way. I loved his portrayal in the sequel even more.
---
No its very true - most of the younger generation can USE computers competently and have a broad knowledge of how to work things. But its a broad and *shallow*. Hand-holdy surface level stuff only.
---
Think people have a problem wi5 the elitist exclusion part.
---
It‚Äôs like hearing someone has a birthday party, but only 1/8th of the office can go because they were born with the right stuff.
---
I'm playing a gnome warrior. When i get noggenfogger i will jump up your arse mmmkay..
---
The SM cath is really popular. But most farming groups will be looking for mages
---
Alliance should not be leveling in Ashenvale on a pvp server to be frank, since only NE tend to have a natural progression there, and you're competing against Orcs, Trolls and Taurens with their natural progression into that zone.
---
You will be vastly outnumbered if the server pop is balanced. 
---
Go level in Wetlands and Darkshire at that range.
---
Reposting my comment when someone mentioned Alex Jones in another thread:
---
I‚Äôm telling you Joe: interdimensional beings have made contact with Azeroth and her leaders. These half human, half goat hybrids are going to replace us all. They will take over our paladins and introduce their cultist space paganism. Our leadership has been compromised. Look at how many people connected to Katrina Prestor have been killed. I‚Äôve been researching this since the First War. Joe, I‚Äôm telling you KATRINA IS A LIZARD PERSON MONSTER BENT ON DESTROYING THE ALLIANCE.
---
Oh wow a cat I havent ever seen anyone own one of those before.
---
This shit belongs on your social media not on reddit
---
Probably... but it kind of depends on WHY you didn‚Äôt think the regular quests were interesting. 
---
Classic quests are generally more important to your character‚Äôs progression, and generally involve more level-appropriate difficulty. They are also steeped in the lore of the area. On the other hand, the actual mechanics of them will be very simple, and the game won‚Äôt tell you exactly where to go unless you have a questing add-on. There‚Äôs also a lot of running from one area to another, and then back again, which can be frustrating. (To some extent you can plan around this if you know in advance where the quests will lead you.)
---
Download the twitch app and then download ‚Äúquestie‚Äù it‚Äôs an add on that will show you all available quests in the world and where to go for them. It will likely show you quests in a zone that you didn‚Äôt know exist
---
Thought you had genuine questions, then realized you were just trying to mask a stream advert.

---
these stats can be generalized to Arugal overall population. However it means nothing about other realms in regards to A:H ratio.
---
STV PVP has been amazing on Thunderfury PVP. Very few 40+ people cheesing and constant lvl 35ish pvp.  No one can get any quests done but damn it's fun.
---
I didn‚Äôt know this 
---
How come? 
---
Or am i being trolled
---
Ah ofcourse, I had the giant lord in memory, my bad.
---
Sad subtlety rogue noises.
---
I‚Äôll send my prayers instead
---
All your comments are AIDS. You are a cancer on this Earth. 
---
Tie that rope real tight and don't puss out.
---
I don't think that's too true, it might depend on where you quest and as which faction.
---
Playing my Orc Warrior at the minute I haven't bought anything but 40s worth of Liferoot from the AH, with Mining and Skinning for more money making to boot. I have only leveled 2 skills past 1. Always chosing the highest value quest rewards (Except for gear upgrades, but they're often the same as a Mail user).
---
Currently 45g short at 36, but I expect to make about 30g within the next 4 levels no problem, but that will still put me 15g short.
---
If it's a rare BOE I'm needing too, it's just as valuable to me.
---
Anyone know if there is an Addon or In-Depth-Guide for Healing Power and when its beneficial to down-rank spells based on healing power, and over all stats? I play priest!
---
Bartender4. It‚Äôs my go-to.
---
He made more money than you since you're born loser.
---
Do you like pop-punk and eat pizza too?
---
It's for retail. At least that's what the message says
---
Anyone have a list of important macros I should start getting used to as a rogue? Never used macros before.
---
It is a cave in revamped org, they even left all the tarps and stuff on top but they intersect with the ceiling in retail. In classic there was nothing on top in the middle of org so it's open
---
I hope you named and shamed them on your servers subreddit. Or in Trade chat. Good luck getting 40g when nobody wants to group with you
---
How do you kill that which has no life?
---
Well before it ended
---
It's not racist. They are on a server called Noggenfogger and they shortened the name of the server for the people that live there. Like calling people from Britain "Brits". It's pure entertainment because there are snowflakes out there that will automatically assume the whole world is racist and get butthurt over innocent fun. They just continue to do it to troll you. It has absolutely nothing to do with racism  except in your head.
---
I did man, all you have to do is download the twitch app then click mods and it downloads it all for you. This is the link for the app https://www.twitch.tv/downloads
---
Increase staves by +2 
---
I love old school set bonuses for being so god damn useless sometimes xD
---
You'll be fine.  It'll take about an hour to complete. It's just rfc, which is super easy,  so just watch your pulls and nuke the whales
---
1 level later
---
Fr I remember being 14 years old and spamming people in org for sigs lmao
---
Oh come now, gnomer isn't *that* bad
---
&gt;Dies from fall damage
---
I would recommend to get the level 14 talents. 
---
RFC is a short instance. Would be able to do all quests in 30-45min without a problem.
---
Yeah I have no idea what is happening here. You should reupload with different colours to blur the names.
---
I first read the title wrong.
---
Of course it is.  They just read that on some dumb guide somewhere.
---
Resist
---
Back when I leveled my warrior in Vanilla I remember solo farming SM graveyard at level 40. Not sure if you need invis potions to get by the first elites, but I recall the main graveyard area has packs that drop a lot of greys and greens.
---
No you dont get it it's not less obstacles so you can get the fun over with as soon as possible so you can grind azerite more efficiently.
---
I think you reacted to the wrong person, because I actually agree with you.
---
Even without using any add-ons, if you get  stuck try the Wowhead website. It should have any information on the different things in the game that might be overwhelming or confusing you.
---
From the basic googling I've done, it seems like every Pvp server is horde favored.  I'll pass, thanks.
---
That‚Äôs some neet advice you got there. When you‚Äôre as busy as me everything is a fucking chore dude.
---
Are you really trying to compare a 2s vendor bop to a 50g ah boe?
---
Both of which will be replaced in a few levels.
---
It's BiS for Warrior until, well almost forever.
---
Those cumstains on the pants tho.
---
Can you attack the character? It's what he would have wanted.
---
Huh, good to know. I was under impression that the horde's main progression line turned south (Stonetalon, Thousand Needles, etc), while eastern Ashenvale (nevermind western) was a less used branch option. 
---
Back in TBC when I last played western Ashenvale was all NE while eastern was more PvP than questing spot, revolving around main entrances to Warsong.
---
it's why they have two buttons, "NEED" and "GREED"
---
Their definitions explain the use of the buttons.
---
Make sure you research your class you are going to play to make sure its the play style you want.  Id say pick any race as a beginner but races affect gameplay at higher levels.  Watch a guide or 2 on the class you want to play, what the stats mean, maybe a leveling guide, and even a profession guide.  When I started playing I was overwhelmed by the sheer amount of spells and abilities I had but you realize that each class only has a few core abilities they use all the time and all the other ones are mostly situational.  For things to be careful about: you WILL die many times, pulling multiple enemies usually results in death, just try not to get frustrated because everyone else is and the game is meant to be punishing.  Group up with any player who looks like he might be on the same quest as you.
---
You can sell bandages for more to vendors then on the AH?
---
From Sheffield, can confirm, we don't have internet yet. We only got running water last week.
---
Mannn I forgot about this. I've been getting everything
---
How much would a whelp pet sell in 1-2 months later?
---
Only for rogues. Fury warriors don‚Äôt care about speed because Bloodthirst is based on AP solely. This also makes for a decent tanking sword because the fast speed allows you to dump rage faster through Heroic Strike.
---
Apparently its a "classic experience, no changes" thing.
---
Might be server dependent. Smolderweb is nothing but shit posts 24/7 lol
---
I couldn‚Äôt have said it better myself. The Kane comparison is very apt.
---
Classic.wowhead.com is your best friend. You can look up quests and items there and it will tell you where to go. If the quests in the zone you are in start to get a little tough, go somewhere else. For example, it‚Äôs totally fine to leave Loch Modan half way through and go to Westfall instead. There‚Äôs an underground tram that connects Ironforge to Stormwind, FYI. Use autorun (I set mine to middle mouse). Pick up 2 gathering professions at the start since money can be pretty scarce (herbalism and mining are pretty good). There‚Äôs lots of 1-60 mage guides out there. Read a couple. You can make your own food and water (it‚Äôs nice to share) and you have a buff that improves Intellect that you should put on yourself and teammates that have blue mana bars. Drink between every pull. Get a wand ASAP. There‚Äôs no need to buy skills that you‚Äôll never use (I‚Äôm looking at you Arcane Missles). Grab a couple addons using Twitch. Questie, Onebag, Auctioneer, VendorPrice are a good place to start. Take your time. Have fun. Invite people you see questing in your area to group.
---
That's bleach. I don't spend much on clothes
---
Whatever the beginning of MoP was. 
---
Tbh though a big part broke the moment flying mounts were added
---
Dagger and OH is better than the staff. Spellpower is more important than the int increase from the staff.
---
Pie chart of the most used dungeons.  Surely they have yhis information.  Like number of player deaths in WC is the kind of useless info i like
---
Can you sell leather for more to vendors, then on the AH?
---
Nah man I cant eat that many carbs
---
Don't destroy my hopes and dreams :(
---
I‚Äôll always instigate those conversations. I literally type ‚Äútrump‚Äù in barrens chat and then they take it from there for about an hour.
---
Alright, now make a bunch of IRL money telling us how to make that much money in game...
---
So did you buy just the mount or the training too?
---
I can assure you that these tipping rumors are not as decent as you think they are. Maybe 1/10 of the people asking for water or food has tipped me a few silver.
---
Its added.
---
Should be 50% + your crit (maybe 5% at 30?).
---
It's common to only notice the absence of crits.
---
Oh man, I gotta try to do stockades now as horde
---
This is surprisingly true.  Also remember a lot of people have bad gear or sub-optimal, so even a level 30 rogue can bring a chunk of pain to a 50 warlock with an Ambush crit.
---
I‚Äôve actually been able to control the urge so far.  Still only focusing on one ally toon and one horde toon this early in the game.  But, I do already have all my alts created as placeholders on both servers.
---
Would you like to order?
---
Don't hate the player, hate the game.
---
So it works as long as the two weaker factions collude, which is against tos.
---
if it were your servers being under attack, you would feel some terror trust me.
---
Damn you‚Äôre bugging, I worked in a pizza place too and couldn‚Äôt eat it when I worked there. I‚Äôm obsessed with it again
---
Prevengers!
---
ok but heres the question. do i need the complete version of wow or just the free version
---
That's classic leveling speed yes. That's leveling speed in /played.
---
Retail, you're looking at less than that for 1-120.
---
Oh.... Yikes. that's just. I don't even.
---
Bloodsail Buccaneers as well. I must confess I actually snickered at a few.
---
could you share which quest in STV, and where in Uldaman?!!!
---
Thank you
---
If it's any consolation I never got anything while lvling until this morning ( lvl 50 ) when I got 2 epic BoEs within 4 hours, one of which was a Bloodrazor ( ~100g )
---
Haha look guys! Someone said something in Barrens chat! Haha classic Barrens chat amirite?
---
Ha fell for the ol "it's just bleach" excuse
---
Let's put it this way, could you handle 5 level 1 mobs? If no, then you aren't going to be skilled enough to beat him, if yes then you'll see exactly why you definitely won't be able to beat him.
---
In this screenshot, that is him clicking the World of Warcraft button, no classic wow appears
---
From 2008 though
---
Well at least they're getting 1 of those things ;)
---
Yeah but you said they haven‚Äôt changed when they most definitely have.
---
damn amazing
---
subbed to your channel
---
Oh you mean the surveys that were given to only the super neckbeards who read this forum? The VAST majority of players do not come here.
---
I KNEW IT! Semen!
---
You are absolutely right, my apologies mate.
---
Whats irl? never heard of it
---
Hell yeah. The deliveries can wait (; I'm lookin cute while leveling my warlock
---
Why wouldn't they extradite?  The UK and the US both extradite all the  time.
---
You can also wait 1 second or so after the tank hits the mob so he can build up aggro
---
11 agi is huge.  But whatever, just play how you like.  If you're leveling as BM, your pet does all the work anyways.
---
I saw a post here with a guide or picture on where to farm gold upp to 7g/hour, ill be needing this for the 40 mount since i didnt fix my professions yet. 
---
Anyone know where these spots are or has the link? Thanks!
---
If your question is can you play with only an integrated then sure but you will most likely drop frames in large pvp battles and raids.
---
Why would someone who wants dungeon finder play classic?
---
He can meet you guys at loch modan. If your human, at stormwind there is a tram that connects dun morogh and stormwind and go to loch modan. Have your friend google wow classic wetlands run.
---
Basically he needs to go to auberdine, darkshore and take a boat to menethil harbor, wetlands. He‚Äôll need to follow the road east outta town all the way east until the road bends to the south. He‚Äôll start climbing the mountain side road through some tunnels until he finally reaches loch modan, where you‚Äôll meet him
---
Sometimes the customers are too drunk to answer the door so we get there order (^: they spoil us
---
yea Im a warlock too. level 41 with 115g, what the fuck are you doing.
---
nope, no need. Sinister strike doesnt reset attack timer. You are good.
---
Or Florida
---
Some, yes. AH prices for many leathers are really low.
---
&gt;we
---
&gt;our
---
take the gold then report them for account sharing lmao
---
Sorry but gnomes are good eats.
---
Can't let all that tender meat go to waste.
---
Just looked it up, the item is BOE. 
---
So sorry to say, but this isn't a ninja. It's not even a tasteless move, tbh. It's good gold that the rogue could have used to buy a piece of gear for himself after all.
---
Just imagine we would be talking about an Epic Quality 0,01 world drop, that you can wear as a warrior, but also sell for hundreds of gold. Would you expect the group to pass for you too?
---
It's the same deal here, just on a smaller scale. I understand not wanting to play with that Rogue again, but "ninja" is thrown around way too much these days. It's a heavy accusation, one that might get YOU in trouble as well if people find out you're just salty because of a lost roll.
---
So as a general advice if this happens again (boe drop that you can use, but also sells on the AH): offer to pay half the AH price to the winner if you want it so bad. That way you have your item for cheap and the other guy a few coins. Everyone wins.
---
Plot twist: he's a c#nt Priest
---
They did a good job. I was constantly getting DC and within minutes they would have it back up, waiting for next attack.
---
What are the best weapons for an enhancement shaman with windfury at 30? Currently running RFK until I get Corpsemaker, 0/2 so far.
---
A letter probably better sent in-game.
---
Nice, thanks man
---
I always hit people with Blessing of Wisdom. It probably wears off before they get to use it.
---
I respect your opinion but i highly disagree.
---
Realms are more relevant in classic. But I think it also has something to do with the queues. Just guessing though. I really have no clue.
---
People don‚Äôt understand that you need BoEs? 
---
He didn‚Äôt ninja it. Everyone should need a random blue drop like this. Too valuable to sell to just use it.
---
Dude. You seriously almost got a tear out of me.
---
Is it the same for Warrior?
---
1.6*
---
From what I read, hunters out range mages with the talent. They‚Äôre max cast range is 35y, with talent you have up to 41y range. If you stay in that zone they can‚Äôt cast and I think??? It cancels the cast if you move too far. You must be careful of blink though. 
---
2nd one is Feign Death. If you FD when they casting anything, it will cancel their cast. Gives you time to shoot 1 more aimed or multi shot which is a lot vs squishy mages.
---
3rd is to spec heavily in BM. If your pet has beastial wrath? The last talent, you auto win mages cause they can‚Äôt cc your pet and it just kills them. Even without that if you have intimidation on pet, that‚Äôs a very good stun to cancel their cast.
---
Awesome! Thanks for sharing
---
I have a warlock for ranged dps and a druid I'm going to heal with. What's another good class i should consider trying for a different play experience? I'm concerned that tanking might be too hard.
---
I love hillsbrad - such a cool feeling that you're kinda questing against the other faction. You took it to the next step, too bad you're fully alliance scum ;)
---
You are failing to recognize that boes are not huge upgrades and that the person can absolutely find those items on the auction house.
---
That warlock was wrong because they got an upgrade for 3 levels when they could have had their mount money in the bank.
---
Then I don't see the reason for 8 extra slots to be needed, bank alt+bank and better bag management he shouldn't have any trouble, neither did I.
---
Ohh, Thanks!
---
Yes you do. 
---
I cant remember the exact reasoning, i'm sure someone will advise correctly. 
---
IIRC you want to SS as soon as you melee so if you parry your not clipping a partial melee and prolonging your next swing. This is 100% min/max.
---
Yeah that's what I meant
---
SLOWLY OTHERWISE YOU MIGHT GET DIZZY
---
That‚Äôs fine if that‚Äôs how the group establishes the drop rules before hand. But unless it is said, the go to normal loot rules are, if you need, you need, greed everything else. If it‚Äôs a rare boe, you need every time regardless.
---
just mention to them there racial has a -50% healing debuff because they might not know about it because warrior don't have heals.
---
It's a joke. A quote from "The Godfather".
---
Not really. He did what you are supposed to do with BoEs.
---
you're WRONG. wrong. wrong. wrong. wrong. wrong.
---
Does the wrist brace help?
---
never pre shield if your tank is a warrior, he cant regen rage
---
So since there‚Äôs no dungeon finder in classic how do you guys find parties? Also is it still like vanilla where you have to run to the dungeons as well?
---
Thats not how it was in vanilla though?
---
How do you show the class colors on the chat?
---
I want that addon.
---
Just summon your mount looool
---
This post was made by Warlock gang
---
Depends on which fights. Some bosses warriors are mandatory because druid can get crit no matter how well geared the are. 
---
Ferals are still decent at tanking, they're just not as good as warriors end game.
---
He literally has that option open on the screenshot
---
I don‚Äôt understand. I‚Äôm 29 am I a boomer? Help
---
Imagine being so brainwashed by the "nazis are everywhere" crap that when you see a number in a name you immediately assume it's code for Heil Hitler and not just a year.
---
Your a dude, I‚Äôm a dude, she‚Äôs a dude
---
Right click things and see what happens :D
---
Read quest texts, there're some most basic tips there (at least about class trainers, about flight paths). Read the ingame tutorials (I think they should be on by default, but if not, browse Esc-&gt;Interface).
---
Know that we all envy your purity.
---
The wrist brace helps me be an elite gamer of course. But its mostly because I completely wrecked my wrist skateboarding during freetime
---
No. That swing timer will save your life as a warrior, many times.
---
Saw con deez nuts
---
Come to Ten Storms! So smoll, so sweet with nice people enjoying the game for What it is, fucking confusing  and epic &lt;3
---
They didn't update them. They just gave it a bit better res.
---
I need to make some mage water for your thirsty ass
---
Finally someone with sense.
---
And went afk immediately after attacking
---
GOT‚ÄôEEM!!!
---
You don't seem to grasp that there's "Greed" vs "Need" buttons when you can roll on something. Honest question: what do those words mean to you,  exactly?
---
No troll. It's one of the reasons the Manual Crowd Pummeller is so good, because it's an activate ability instead of an on hit.
---
Imagine have a 1 hour cd hearthstone
---
This post was made by the shaman gang
---
&gt;	For all the haters, speak for yourself. You are not the entire wow community.
---
I speak for myself and my family when I say: no.
---
There is no way we want group finder sites or addons or additives functionality. We want the socialisation that comes from actively talking to people to form groups.
---
Speak for yourself when you say you don't want it, but don't assume the silent majority do.
---
I'm pretty sure you can't without an active subscription.  It wasn't in my drop down menu until I added a play time card, then it popped right up.
---
Shaman is a great choice as you can heal your warrior friend, and also deal a good amount of damage. It is a harder class to master as you have a lot of totems and you aren't really a master of damage or tanking. You can heal relatively well as I mentioned before so if you're looking to help your friends and be able to hold your own when you're without them, you'll be just fine with shaman. I'd recommend looking into priest or druid before you make a choice as those would also compliment this group well.
---
I never really liked the cross realm thing. I mean, I get it and for the game it‚Äôs a good thing, but that‚Äôs one of the things that destroyed the community. In classic, I‚Äôm seeing people again in the hinterlands doing elites that I saw back in the barrens as a level 12 scrub. And that‚Äôs pretty cool
---
Never trust a guy with two first names
---
lel
---
Fear + enemy player + pack of murlocs = LoL
---
It's pretty hard out here with everyone levelling and the ridiculously massive supply of every item. Being 5x or more the pop of a vanilla server has affected the economy a fuckton. 
---
Everything is in such high supply, and it's hard to say if this is gonna change. Inflation will help us better afford mounts/etc though. Unless no one changes prices even once gold is worth less.
---
What do you think "Greed" means? Honest question.
---
Beginning of the end for WoW but was first introduced in vanilla which is regarded as the holy grail of WoW.
---
Group up first chance you get. It's gonna make life a lot easier.
---
Don‚Äôt forget to stable your main pet and go tame pets with higher ranks of abilities.
---
Sometimes you don‚Äôt learn the ability right away, you will have to use the pet for a few kills, letting it use the ability, until you see the yellow text that‚Äôs says you‚Äôve learned that ability.
---
http://vanillawowhunter.com/vanilla-wow-pet-skills/
---
Also the sword talent for extra proc will reset timer, but i think energy tick is more important anyways
---
Oh yes.
---
No heal, no escape mechanism, weak cc.
---
You are correct, but do i really want to grind out 25 levels again right now?
---
I love when an outfit comes togrther
---
You don‚Äôt but if you go sword spec and get hand of justice later on it will improve your damage a bit. The reason why is that sword spec extra hit can prod off sinister strike. The extra attack from it resets swing timer so you want to use sinister strike right before a swing timer reset Incase you get an extra attack. It‚Äôs solely for min maxing really
---
My "teen that just discovered rock" vanilla leveling playlist that takes me right back to '05:
---
* Rage Against The Machine
---
* System Of A Down
---
* Franz Ferdinand
---
* Jet
---
* Gorillaz
---
* My Chemical Romance
---
* Authority Zero
---
also pretty much any song from Guitar Hero 1 and 2
---
As a what now?
---
Sounds like it is yours. But not sure if the ddos is over.
---
It‚Äôs really cool until you realize the other quest reward 2H mace sells for 30s more.
---
Thanks, now I will not unsee this. My main concern was the green arrow pointing like this is some Simpson's Hit &amp; Run Game. Now its the xp bar.
---
Still wrong though mate weren‚Äôt you?
---
So did this Mage steal the mobs after you had already aggroed them or was the Mage initiating the pulls themselves?

I never understood why people would change the unit frames, other then for raids maybe. The original are so nice and clear to me that I can't get used to the 1 color bars from those addons.
---
It's a good system to differentiate between someone making a profit off something vs "I can use and equip this, and it's an upgrade to what I'm currently using."
---
I saw a video saying a good way to play ret paladin, if you really want to, is stack chance on hit items and gear that deal damage. Whether it's food buffs, your weapon etc. you might be able to keep a spot good spot on the damage meter, if you can convince your raid or party you're relevant.
---
Not sure who this a burn on tbh
---
LFG aoe dungeon farm so I can race too end game and bitch that there is no content because I skipped 90% of it!
---
What level are you ? üôÑ
---
Rogue or Fury Warrior for melee dps
---
How good is green tower shield? Just got it on my priest (already have my mount, so I'm not desperate for money) and I'm not sure what price range should I list it for since not a single other one is on AH. 50g, 100g, 10g? Wait until more people have level 60?
---
I just hope they keep it that way
---
Does not seem to work for me
---
Lol no. You guys just don‚Äôt know how it works. Groups I‚Äôm in always roll need for BoEs: it‚Äôs pretty stupid to equip something to level instead of selling it for a bunch of gold.
---
I just looked on their website and it states you need an active subscription.
---
You‚Äôre right, when it comes to some items, like those you can‚Äôt get until endgame.  But a majority of items people are farming and plenty of people are playing the AH which is easy to see with 5minutes spent on any decent populated server.
---
You always bring it back to it increasing the likelihood of sale.  Nobody here has once argued against you for that.  You‚Äôre like a broken recorder repeating the same shit over and over that nobody has disagreed with.  This entire argument has been whether or not deep undercuts could hurt the market, which you haven‚Äôt really touched on.  You just say ‚ÄúBuT iT iNcReAsEs ThE cHaNcE oF sElLiNg It‚Äù  which nobody gives a shit about but you.
---
Have a good day.  Not really worth arguing with a wall.

IIRC in the UK a council estate is public housing, similar to The Projects in the US.

You spent all your skill points on RNG, should have put at least one in the ability to press Print Screen button.

addon questie

Zoomer detected
---
I am playing this game for 13 years on EU Servers and this was never a thing. Are you from NA?
---
Or type /join lookingforgroup
---
Choose gathering professions. Skinning and herbs or mining
---
what should my int/spirit ratio be as a priest heading towards endgame? also just to clarify int does not affect spell power at all correct?
---
I think it has to do with the extra attacks from Sword Specialization which DO reset the swing timer, although everything else doesn‚Äôt. 
---
Even so, unless you‚Äôre min maxing, you can probably do without. I don‚Äôt have one because it feels too much like every fight is just a minigame where you press buttons when a bar is up or down.
---
Go ahead and make it. Blizzard will break it
---
Even tho the imbalance is real, I‚Äôd still recommend STV. There is a group of tigers that spawn in a jagged circle that you should be able to clear pretty easily and avoid any horde. The area is to the east of kurzen compound. I‚Äôd at least check it out for half an hour, because it is one of my favorite spots to farm gold.
---
I was sorta right!
---
"Swing Timer Importance Lvls 31+
---
At level 31 you will get your first point in Sword Specialization. This Extra Attack Proc will reset your swing timer so if you are about to attack again naturally and this procs the benefit will be wasted.
---
Let‚Äôs say you are auto attacking normally every 2.0 seconds. Your Sinister Strike normally doesn‚Äôt interfere with your auto attacks but due to this talent they can now proc the additional sword hit which would reset your swing timer potentially clipping into your normal auto attack cycle.
---
For this reason, from the point you get Sword Spec onwards you need to use Sinister Strike only after your main hand strike animation. This make it so if it procs off SS you won‚Äôt have much of a reset loss if anything at all."

What lvl are you now? When launch hit I played a hunter as well for my first toon. Those damn arrows and costs! I remember the grind to afford my epic mount still.
---
This happened to me in ratchet on Thursday or Friday. Wandered in just trying to do my lock quests and decided to fish at the pier by the boats. Kept getting feared and stuff as the boat was going away.
---
I did get attacked by a lower level though running through the barrens so I feared and followed him until he aggro'd a bunch of mobs and watched him die.
---
Bear tanks can actually main tank all raids, this was proven by the top tier feral spec players, although your average joe won‚Äôt have enough time to farm all the necessary gear and consumes, it can be done and a properly min maxed bear tank generates more threat than port warrior hands down.
---
That being said, yes; most groups will be better off with a prot warrior, but there‚Äôs a big misconception about bear tank.
---
I mean I said I wanted to roll exclusively on the ring and I specifically talked to the Shaman beforehand to ask if he was gonna roll. If he was going to roll I wasn't going to do the instance. Literally the other group members were congratulating me when it dropped. Then he needed it and won it. And I quit the instance and got off. He ruined the instance for the rest of the party, all who could have gotten big upgrades throughout the rest of the instance. If you say "if you want it keep running it til you get it", then there should be no surprise if I hearth out after not getting it. Why should I waste my time running the rest of the instant if there is zero chance of getting what I came for. I get on this Reddit people have the "fuck u i get mine" conservative mentality and wanna need on upgrades just for gold. Thats fine. Just dont act shocked if I dont aggro away shit and let u die or leave the instance to find a better group. There is a difference between thinking a piece is exclusively warrior gear and what I did. Which is ask the shaman beforehand if he was gonna roll need. I'm fine if he needs it. I'm just not tanking if that is his plan.
---
Just did that thank you very much deleting the post
---
Well then you're just a dick.
---
Fix your pants
---
Yes.  +Healing has a considerable amount over other items around the same level that do +Dmg and healing, though the draw back is, wearing all healing gear you don't do any extra damage, but if you're healbotting people, doesn't matter.
---
Spirit is the best stat hands down.  A common misconception from Vanilla was priests in raids would get MP5 and high Int, which just gave them a big initial mana pool, and they'd use consumables like tubers, pots, and runes to keep their mana up.  If you learn to use high spirit + 5second rule with rolling heals, you tend to never need any consumables.  I use to raid with +600 Spirit after we were getting into AQ40, and I'd be able to watch my mana regen without an issue.  At that time, it was common to have healers paired up and would swap out so the other could regen.  Needless to say, I was the guy in the guild who didn't need a partner usually.  Priests are all about regen.  +Healing I'd say is a toss up between that and spirit, but once you surpass +450, you tend to want to grab some healing boosts.  Renew takes in 100%, but some other talents like Flash have a reduced amount.  So, just be aware.  I knew guys hwo used 1 or 2 ranks lower on Greater Heal or used Heal and relied on their +Healing and lower mana costs to keep their mana up, but I never had issues with high spirit and rolling heals to use my max level, and even with a 18disc/2holy/31 shadow spec I'd still outheal others and have a 5% or less overhealing after raid boss encounters.
---
I‚Äôm kind of confused. You want no wait time to log in but don‚Äôt want a dead server? I hate the log in wait timer but I‚Äôd much rather have that than have a dead server.
---
All green BoEs are sellable on the AH too, but people pick greed and let anyone that needs it take it. It's the same situation just on a larger scale.
---
...I don't disagree, just felt like doing that.
---
Right click add -&gt; add battlenet tag

I think shaman is a great choice.  You can provide a ton of useful utility as a shaman that will help the team as well as help yourself when solo.  I play a warrior and I love having my shaman friend around even more than my priest friend when questing.  Gotta do an underwater quest? No problem.  Need heals? No problem.  Need a little off tanking?  No problem.  Extra dps? No problem.  Windfury totem.  Fast running when you're questing back and forth alone, faster hearthstone.  So many useful abilities.  Other good choices are druid or priest.  With your friends as a warrior and mage I'd at least choose something that can heal
---
That's not a ninja, BoE are up for grabs.
---
I‚Äôve always been under the though that if it‚Äôs a blue boe, that everyone needs regardless who can use it. That‚Äôs what every group that I‚Äôve been apart of has done. A rogue even got blue pants out of a chest he unlocked and put it up for roll.
---
If you can't find one you can just manually make macros for it.
---
I have a den desk but didn't like sitting in the den or at a real desk so I found pretty comfortable foldable table on amazon for $20 that I just move from room to room. Now it feels like I'm participating in family stuff, just also with warcraft.

All I know is, there is an hour long maintenance starting at 7am PST / 10am EST.

People can't log on that's why servers seem dead. You need to calm down.

What's classic 5-man healing like? Last healing I really did was a druid in legion, which was pretty much just stacking hots...
---
Gatekeep some more.
---
Just wait until you hear about the cleft of shadow
---
It's for situations when you don't have enough rage, and aren't attacking the target already. Like if the previous target dies, and you have no rage left, and you want to swap to the next target. Abilities you can't use due to lacking rage, or abilities that are on CD won't start auto attacks unless you macro it.
---
They had (its in classic too) a group finder, but it didn't form groups smartly. It would literally just put the first 5 people who queued into a group together, you could end up with 5 healers or 2 heals 3 dps - it didn't care.
---
Any macros experts out there that can help me figure out why this isn't putting me into Prowl when I'm in Cat form? It just seems to be refreshing Cat form, which it should only be doing if I press alt.

Aww, poor you.  As I‚Äôve quested in Herod I‚Äôve seen more horde but I‚Äôd estimate, only from my observations, 60/40.

You sir are a lucky one.

Almost all the infinity bags!

Last census result I say said 3.5/2 Horde/Alliance, which is a little closer to 65/35 I think.

Don't worry at around 40 u will get 2 14slot bags ,one from uldaman endquest and one from a riddle found in strangelthorn in one of the boats to the right of booty bay

yeah it's not but it's clearly used that way, and used to mean black people, it's not some super hard to understand thing and it's a little obtuse to pretend otherwise

1.3? 1.6 or bust.

Actually all undead rogues are zoomers

This is my same deal. I'm out of that nonsense any time I am not actively trying to group up.

No it's correct. The shitty roleless lfg came way before summoning stones just no one used it.

Well when you start the onyxia attunement you are going to have a great time!

Ah the uninformed angry poster.

Thanks for the well wishes but my post history disagrees with you that I post every thought that comes to mind

The group finder existed but was never used, it just put 5 people together regardless of their roles. I don't remember anyone ever actually using it, most people didn't even know it existed.
---
Follow him around sneakily and then attack when he goes AFK to take a shit
---
It's okay, he had safe fall
---
As shitty as this is.. this is what I like about classic pvp servers. The other faction can be ruthless and sometimes you just have to kill them.. remember their name and kill them some more as time goes on
---
That‚Äôs how you get em. Reel them in with something that is relevant to their interests, and then hit em hard with disappointment.
---
That‚Äôs what I was gonna say. Macro that shit
---
Honestly I would advocate to not look up anything!  You are familiar with common class playstyles already.  YOu mention you want to play a mage.  Mages of course are fragile, high damage classes.  WoW Mages are very fun to play you have multiple forms of CC, instant damage spells, AOE damage spells, and strong single-target damage spells like fireballs or frostbolts. 
---
WoW is, believe it or not, relatively noob-friendly.  There are lots of 'new player tips' that the game keeps feeding you until you turn them off.  YOu only learn one or two spells at a time as you level, so you gradually integrate what you've learned into your playstyle and it's not like you get 50 things dumped on you at once. 
---
Learn your class by playing it!  I'd say get to level 15 or so, THEN watch a guide and it will help you a lot more.  You'll know the very basics, and be able to absorb some of the more useful 'tips and tricks'.
---
No, what is this thread for?
---
A boats a boat but the mystery box can be anything! It can even be a boat!
---
This happened on Pagle a few times.  The time I was in Goldshire when a hunter kited him the full way he didn't stay around long enough for Stitches to aggro anyone because everyone was too low to actually hit him and then he got stuck between a building and tree and evaded for about 5 seconds and poofed away.  That's a big time investment for no payoff.
---
Idk why you're getting downvoted you're correct here
---
You could get new ranks of their damage abilities like claw/bite.
---
This is the most important part. You can be a really good tank, but the game mechanics will make it so that some fights will be nearly if not impossible to complete with a Druid as the Main Tank. Being Crit/Crushed can one shot you and the raid can't just keep Brezzing you and hoping you get threat back. Warriors are able to raise their defense skill enough that this doesn't happen to them. Its not a player problem its a mechanics problem that you can't fix.
---
You need yourself one of these. https://www.amazon.ca/gp/aw/d/B00X6J1J6Q?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title

I wanted to install it on my wife‚Äôs laptop but she didn‚Äôt have a WoW Retail character and it wouldn‚Äôt give me the option to select WoW Classic.  Due to her limited HD space I logged her into my computer, created a Retail character then logged her back into Bnet on her computer.  That‚Äôs when Classic WoW showed up for us.  So I would try to create a WoW Retail toon for him and then try again.
---
This made up bullahit about everyone needing for the cash is fucked up. "Need" means you can use the gear. "Greed" means you can sell the gear. That's how it was always intended and the whole purpose of the need/greed concept.
---
Not angry, just saying this is a low effort post that didn't really need to be posted.
---
Does all of reddit really need to hear about how you hope to play a couple of hours today?
---
When I was leveling my first mage, I had a more experienced mage take me under his wing and we'd dual 'solo'. I'd take a mob, then he'd take a mob, and watching his playstyle really helped loads.
---
Some people may just not be cut out to be good mages. While they're kit is really simple and straight forward, how they execute a fight has a tremendous impact on their effectiveness.
---
I'm a BMET. This contract is up I'm not reenlisting anywhere.
---
As someone new to the game, this thread despite a lot of hostility has been interesting to read and in all honesty it seems like if you roll need some people will hate on you and some wont so may as well just roll need. 
---
Before feasting this thiugj if I couldn't have equipped something I wouldn't have put need but based on the gold argument I am definitely going to roll need and detect people here if they have a problem lol
---
Most people swear by respecing at 40 full shadow. I did that once and I was basically garbage with it tthough, since shadow form is *extremely* mana intensive at 40. I mostly would want to wait, not just for the want spec, but also so the mana cost is slightly mitigated by a larger pool at later levels.

Is there an option? If not is there any addons that achieve the same thing?

Yeah there really isnt a reason to not pick shaman unless you dont enjoy the class. It's the perfect complement

A lot of people have told me that if Ret Palladin was to succeed, it's very expensive in terms of foods and potions constantly aswell as weopon enchants and what not. 
---
I'm mainly wearing leather and mail ATM, all agility, str and attack power (only the big boys like +12) and my DPS is insane, so I thought if I can apply these same fundamentals at level 60, I'd be doing OK, not the best or topping charts, but OK. :)
---
I‚Äôve been having this issue with my mouse for atleast a year now and it‚Äôs very inconsistent. 
---
Problem started on retail and I noticed yesterday it would sometimes do it on classic aswell. 
---
Have not found a fix yet.
---
Tell me the truth then
---
This is all I thought of when I saw the title!
---
How could you even consider that? There‚Äôs got to be some other way
---
I play horde and this sounds like something I would have done too. I also like stealthing whilst watching clothies fighting mobs and getting down to half health before bursting them down and watching them run around panicking. :D
---
What other luck do you need? That might be the most expensive Boe epic in the game in phase 1. That should sell for a few thousand gold. I'd take 3k or 4k over a bis epic any day.
---
Heartseeker seems dead because it's DOA. 36hrs in and we have less than 3500 individual postings on the AH.  That's not a good sign.
---
No I just don't think it's as big a deal as you are making it. Plus Alex ain't on my server, even if a few people do this on mine, it won't kill the game. If people want to jump to hyperbolic statements, then so shall I.
---
Classic is more about end game and min maxing. It's possible to just not buy on the ah and go have an alt to pick it for you.
---
Why even play this version of the game if you're gonna skip everything.
---
Like I get in retail, endgame is pretty much the total goal.
---
But vanilla wow was much more about the journey than the destination.
---
No there isn‚Äôt, you could use the add on Titan panel but I‚Äôm not sure they updated it for classic.
---
If everyone uses it intelligently sure.
---
But letting a plate wearer need on a 50gold item that is only good for 4-6 levels or already worse than a comparable bop dungeon drop is stupid. Which is applicable to ops image.
---
It should be sold for the group's benefit.
---
There's a DDOS attack every expansion, it should have been expected to happen for wow classic.  I'm Not surprised.
---
Did someone say "Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseekeer"?
---
Usually it is a botnet yes. There have been cases of single machine DOS attacks but DDoS implies it was over a larger network of machines (\*\*distributed\*\* denial of service).
---
Usually something along the lines of: 
---
\[Script Kiddie\] -&gt; \[ C&amp;C \] -&gt; \[BOTS \]   
---
So you look at what traffic is being sent to each bot hitting your network, they'll all be talking to either a single or sometimes a couple of C&amp;Cs (command and control) and if the person is not smart (like the kid who did this shit) they can then look at the traffic coming into the C&amp;C and from there it's only a matter of time before they narrow down the Script Kiddie.
---
Mine did this the other day.  I restarted my computer and it's good now.

BS on your arena ranking. Not super relevant to your post but this claim is obviously wrong.

Noone was 2600+ in seasons 1-2 and probably not 3(wasn't active enough that season to remember).

Mages on your server buy polymorph?

I use WeaponSwingTimer on my warrior and it works perfectly.  Definitely recommend

I‚Äôm a priest approaching 40 with 160 Light Leather, 160 Medium Leather, and 100 Heavy Leather, with some hides and scraps too. I need mount money. 
---
Do I:
---
* A: Vendor them. 
---
* B: Auction them. 
---
* C: Send them to druid alt to Leatherwork and then sell.
---
This happens all the time to me as well. If anyone has a solution please post it.
---
Only twinks should buy them and people with a lot of money leveling an alt or if it is a trash rare not worth much.
---
Another super original idea.
---
Well in their defence, the guild name is Toxic after all
---
Out of curiosity, what abilities does the ‚Äòtongue‚Äô class have?
---
Maybe it's only my view on this case but it was always for me the first priority to come out of a dungeon stronger. Yes everybody comes out richer, too. But this shouldn't be the first goal while leveling. 
---
If a cloth class would roll on 'my' BOE defias set leather piece and win i would instantly kick this guy/ girl if i could.
---
Your standard for bitching is fascinatingly low.

Zandalar Tribe is the best server, as long as you don't troll RP people

I certainly wouldn't heal your runs
---
It'll probably take less time than finding a tank.
---
You track down trolls, slaughter them mercilessly and cut their tusks off.  Its glorious.  
---
The only catch is no matter how hard you try, you're not very good at cutting and end up wrecking most of the tusks.  So you gotta kill alot of trolls.
---
OP, learn to screenshot.

Well, one detail changed: A lot of dumb jokes feel way too forced. Like people that just randomly write a Chuck Norris joke into the Barrens chat, because "thats what we are supposed to do".

---
From what I saw, you can potentially top charts, but like you said: it's expensive.
---
Idk why people would be salty about it, then again I made a comment in another thread simply stating that I've ran into people that didnt know the game had autorun and my karma on it was just jumping all over the place. People are just rude I suppose.

And just to clarify, there are posts from thottbot mentioning that they've sold this belt for 10g on the AH.  I wouldn't expect it to get that much right now, this early in the game's life, but even selling it for 2-3g would be a huge improvement over the stats it gives you over similar green/quest reward belts.  That's kind of why the BOE manners existed.  Although we used to greed on them, and if someone needed and said they were going to use it, they were the ninja.

It's impossible to have fun at a party without humor, which is what he's talking about. It's like some people are just coiled up, ready to be offended at a moment's notice. I don't get it.

I agree, this does not seem possible.

You don't receive rested xp when you log out outside of an inn.
---
I demand t√¥ know your addons right now. Specially the portrait addon
---
Sounds interesting and all, but I‚Äôm not on board, BC plz
---
My boy. UT04 is pinnacle of gaming.
---
You need to learn Journeyman Alchemy. Go to UC and ask a guard where the Alchemy trainer is and you'll have to pay like 40s to train it.
---
Had this happen and they just kept doing it. Haha! Group leader and tank so guess he felt like he could do what he wanted. 
---
Someone in our group got there before him on the next chest and took it. Insta kicked ;(
---
When did this happen?
---
I've also gotten a few points in a row from green first aid crafts. Yellow should be higher chance, but at the end of the day luck is luck
---
Thanks alot! &lt;'3
---
They put a top on it in Cata to make room fro the Zep towers.. and to keep filthy flying people from enjoying themselves.
---
Where does that hole even go lol
---
what exactly would be the point of this macro? wouldnt it be the same as just using my mount/dismount keybind?
---
oh no OP this guy wont heal your runs, whatever will you do
---
youre prob terrible anyway if you cant heal a dungeon without a tank

Hi, /u/JordPG

Unfortunately your post has been removed by our AutoModerator because it was thought to belong in our weekly [What Should I Play Wednesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search?q=flair%3AWSIP%2BWednesday&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) thread. This is thread is the best place to ask questions regarding class, professions, and race choices. 
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d1b60r/dont_know_what_class_to_play/). 
---
Why are you here?
---
Once upon a time, I tried to zone out of BFD, failed to zone, fell through the world and died.
---
I released and found myself at the graveyard. No, not the Ashenvale one. In the Badlands.
---
I graveyard rezzed and ran down the hill to Kargath and got the flight point. Later when I wanted to quest there I just flew down. It was only months later leveling an alt that it occurred to me that I had no idea how to actually run to the Badlands.
---
So, yeah. It's the real Classic experience.
---
As a Druid what stats should i be going for? Im 34 and going Feral route. havent really decided DPS or Tank
---
first 5 points is wands.  Soon as you can equip a wand, get a wand.  Wand, Wand Wand.  You essentially have zero downtime if you SW Pain and Wand the shit out of everything.  Once you hit 10 or 12, go to RFC, then WC, then... yea, just grind instances.  Once you hit 30, you basically ride groups in SM til 44.
---
Since we're on topic of buffs and hunters:  
---
Paladins, dont give hunters BoM. 
---
Its useless, it only works on melee AP.  
---
Give BoM to pet and BoW to hunter!
---
Ah really. Someone said it's not worth it. So should I go there at 32? Until 34? I kinda prefer dungeons to questing and if you get that much xp for 15-20 mins that sounds decent.
---
Take of your gear and just go for it. Welcome to vanilla my friend :)
---
Affordable? It's relatively expensive but it's blizzard, they can afford it.
---
You really shouldn't be needing that much drinking if you have spirit tap 5/5 and are leveling somewhat on your own.
---
Blizzard doesn't just let servers stay dead though. If you want to go by Blizzard's track record, every single time a server has been this low pop they have combined them with another.
---
oh I see. though, I figured hitting stuff even when lacking rage would activate autoattack.
---
This is priceless. I assume you couldn't have gotten up there otherwise, but maybe there are a few entry points with wall jumping? I'm not super familiar with that.
---
Here are some situations showing why it‚Äôs beneficial to have growl on autocast: 
---
1.	you start fighting a mob and tell your pet to growl. Generally this is enough threat with his other attacks to hold aggro if it‚Äôs your level or lower. Having it on autocast would mean it gets used again right before the mob dies when that focus could be used on a bite to end the fight more quickly. 
---
2.	you can drink as a hunter and send in your pet to start fighting a mob while you recover mana. When you join in he will have enough threat without growl to hold aggro til the mob dies. 
---
Obviously there are often fights where you have to use growl multiple times but having control over when it‚Äôs used is better for the reasons mentioned above.
---
like at 4am server time. Had just gotten home off my overnight and logged into duskwood with an army of hood trouncing through town when I was killing worgen for a quest

Idk man, the people I'm grouping with for BRD are tipping 4-8g for 5-6 stacks of level 45 water

hes actually pretty talented if hes not above 12

No. Graphics are the same. Resolution is resolution.

Thank you! I'll definitely look again when wow comes back from maintenance

DS3
---
The current guy/group is still ddossing...? No headlines or anything saying he was caught. What make you believe he is already caught?
---
I report people for spamming layer invites. Fuck em
---
Why the fuck would they scheduled maintenance on a weekend?
---
Haha no surprise they gotta do it at 4am...
---
Still can't log into the game, receiving error 51900328 between the login screen and the character selection screen. Sometimes it asks me to select a realm, sometimes it doesn't. It's been this way since yesterday's attacks and whatnot. Is there anything I can do on my end for this error? I've looked it up but the most popular results were for retail or from 2013/2014
---
ddoss'ing a game older than you

My guild is looking for a chad to carry us through MC. Are you available?

What the fuck is 21,00? 21,000? 21.00? 2100?
---
25 Paladin, decided I don't like their healing style OR how they feel to play in the open world. Might play this one with my buddies who don't play as much as me.  
---
21 Mage, probably going to actually level this one to 60 eventually as a farming character  
---
14 Priest. Eh? Maybe? If i want to go full on endgame healer I'll probably level this  
---
11 Rogue, playing on a full pop pvp server, probably going to be my first 60, was the first class I made back in BC.

&gt; 30yr old boomers

Those are Millennials.

One of the first few times i ran stockade i realized i cant just dps i gotta wait then send my pet then send serpant sting and auto shot, i cant use arcane shot cause ill steal aggro.
---
Depends on your gloves bro.
---
I should be mad at this response but legit laughed out loud
---
This sentence gave me flashbacks.
---
This is how Ant Man beat Thanos in version 1,327,864
---
the last time blizz got DDoS attacked the dude got caught by the FBI. it hasnt happened to these new people yet but considering how careless they appear to be it's only a matter of time.
---
I had something similar happen last night. I was in a party doing quests in Loch Modan. We found a chest in a cave and a random hunter came along and tried to loot it, but got in combat. I said, "roll for chest?" He never responded, but I still helpsd him kill the mob, just to be nice. My partner and I rolled for the chest and I rolled higher. Dwarf started opening the chsst the second he got out of combat. I called him out on it and said he wasn't being fair. He told me to fuck off and what not.
---
I got to watch him die after he pulled 3 mobs that were two levels higher than him :3
---
And a hunter topping the damage meter. Give it to him.
---
The game has been out for over 12.5 days, i don't see how 8d8h in that time is so hard to believe.
---
I set it as my text message sound.
---
The thing is, my brother is going herb/alc so I don't really have a need/want to double up on a profession like that, and be fighting over herbs/recipies when we're together
---
Yeah, this is basically how I felt. I had a long week of work and was looking forward to finally leveling my character with a good friend who lives on the other side of the country so I don't get to see him much. Was frustrating that the opportunity was taken from me.
---
&gt;Just like it isn't hard to kill someone, you just don't do it cause you'll get caught.
---
This is creepy, thank you.
---
what does that have to do with not being able to login ANY bliz game for the past 8 hours
---
Was reading another thread earlier and some dude was defending Ninja'ing blue BoE's because OP lost an item he could equip right away to someone who wanted to sell it on the AH. 
---
Glad to see some old folks who remember blacklists :D
---
Then... What's the problem? According to you they're gonna sorted. Just be patient and wait!
---
Yeah can still do that, it won't be at RAF speeds but you could very easily do it still.
---
Good Guy Ssussssles!
---
I totally forgot about these channels so I think many new players are not familiar with them. They are great so people don't need to stick to city /2 Trade but can be in the world while LFG/LFM.
---
Just FYI all you have to do is open the .zip and drag/drop whatever is immediately visible into the addons folder. I've never had to rename anything.
---
They‚Äôre pretty solid. The taste is minimal, 5% is more than a light beer and they go down like water. Easy to crush a 12 pack on a summer night and not feel bloated or overalls full. I would absolutely grab these if they were real.
---
^^^
---
Yeah likewise
---
Roll once instead of rolling 5 times.
---
He kind of looks like a baby..
---
Nah get lost
---
hope this will fix it. problem is it isnt just a wow issue for him.
---
This is why I've opted to endure the queues and stay on a full server 
---
Better chances at longevity
---
That's some Flower's for Algernon shit.
---
Disable it in game see if it's fixed.  Also recommend Adibags.
---
Ur sister hot?
---
You on skeram? I‚Äôve always wanted to try that!
---
Gunna have to hard disagree with you on WoD being better than cata or mop :)
---
Nothin
---
Whenever I'm in a dungeon it feels like there's one person who wins all the greed rolls... Had this one guy literally win every single green in SM Armory; I was hoping to win a few things to DE but I got nothing. :(
---
I love the fucking Prince of Zimbabwe vibe this has.
---
Thanks. What do you think is a good level to start? Isn't 10 the lowest someone can enter a dungeon?
---
Lol I'm asking for experienced warriors to weigh in on whether or not the combined slow speed and racial bonus of using the WW axe outweighs the base DPS and stat gain of Bonechewer. 
---
Did you actually read my post?
---
Always ask to be the party leader, and utilize raid icons. When you get to the dungeon, clearly state the order in which the group should attack the raid icons. When target #1 is at about 50% health, start sundering target #2, and so on. Most importantly - communicate. Most DPS will take your cues happily.
---
I have an alt modifier on cancel form though
---
That chest has only crap
---
In STV it's the total opposite. Someone calls for aid when being killed by Horde, it's either total silence or someone chats back "Just avoid that area until they leave"
---
How gear dependent is feral druid when leveling? I only have bear form right now but stuff takes forever to kill and often I end up with less than half my hp after one on level enemy
---
I just healed a tankless RFK, it was a hail marry run to try and beat the shutdown. 
---
Two dps wars split the majority of the incoming damage so healing was rather smooth. 
---
We didn‚Äôt get to do the escort because servers shut down a few minutes early but other than that we got everything
---
I WANNA SEE HIM FLY
---
Hoobastank -same direction, from Arkarized, the druid. With his video he got me as a druid. And I am playing a druid again. On the horde side!
---
Generally found it pretty fun so far but always make sure you keep an eye on your mana as that's a big thing for healing in classic, I've found it pretty efficient to keep renew up on the tank during fights and just use small, less mana heals for packs and keeping our bigger heals for bosses. Also don't let the tank/dps' drag you around, make sure they know when you're OOM and need to drink, I've had my share of the rest of a group running on and not giving a shit but most of the time everyone is v chill with it
---
You can unlock the window and expand it if you want to be able to read it better.  If the spam is getting in the way of seeing whispers/party/guild/etc chat its pretty benificial to make another tab in the chat log and only put the stuff you want to see in it so you can easily switch to it instead rather than having to scroll up through the chat.  You can also just leave the chats that are spamming temporarily and join back when you want/need to see that stuff.
---
It‚Äôs a very good weapon at 40, and through the 40s. You can get it as early as 30 with help, in which case it‚Äôs absolutely insane. And you don‚Äôt have to win a dungeon drop as it‚Äôs a quest. 
---
The closest equivalent is verigans fist for paladins, but they get that at 20 so it‚Äôs outleveled much quicker. There aren‚Äôt really any other equivalent game changing class quests other than paladins and warlocks getting their mounts as class features.
---
Does he have aspect of the pack though?
---
Huh. This looks like a pretty useful tool for all sorts of stuff. Thanks for sharing!
---
Nah. Price rises each reset.
---
Shadowed unit frames, bartender, quartz, mapster, prat, weakauras, and sexymap.
---
That selection of add-ons will let you tweak your UI in the way that you like, but I don't recommend installing them all at once.  Start with bartender and slowly add more.  Each one takes time to configure.
---
Warlock to 15, then my leveling partner took too long. Got a Hunter to 18. Now I‚Äôm hitting up the Rogue life for a while. 
---
Eyeballing a priest, too.
---
Yes this is for [battle.net](https://battle.net) issues altogether.
---
They pretty good doe
---
Thanks for the correction! IlI always lumped it in with the T9 patch in my mind as I viewed TotGC as an absolutely shit raid sandwiched between two great raids.  Just seems more fitting that the worst feature to ever hit the game was added with T9 lol
---
I think it's just people that have the retail mindset that they NEED to get to max level ASAP or they will be behind.
---
Lol mate. The only power display that happens at 9/11 is that of the American government and what they can get away with it. On top of that the people behind it (Saudi Arabia) are still doing good business with America. 
---
So, please tell me how there is no benefit in it for these people. Because reality and history shows that crime definitely pays. You just gotta be smart about it and have good connections. And by crime I mean all the shit governments and high profile people get away with.

A small glimmer of hope is that Jeffrey Epstein did come to his justice. But all the years before that he was the Prime Symbol of what power could all achieve you.

---
Yes lvl 10

White claws are for pussies

Have you heard of this innovation called "screenshot"?
---
I've seen rogues tanking some encounters in MC and BWL, there were reported shamans off-tanking, but it doesn't cancel one solid fact: warriors are vastly superior for tanking in vast majority of raid encounters.
---
Have any other hunters had difficulty learning Charge rank 3? I tamed Bellygrub and he has it, but after about half an hour charging random mobs I still haven't learned it. Charge 2 I learned on the first use, so I'm wondering if Bellygrub is buggy?
---
Downvote this post. Fuck dungeon finder
---
This is what an addiction looks like.
---
Mages are the only class I will always just turn and run from. Can't rage through their roots or slow, and you can only intercept every 30 seconds while their blink and nova is on a shorter cooldown. Absolutely disgusting
---
As enhance it's generally agreed upon that even though you primarily use 2h, you should have a shield and 1h just in case.
---
I logged off early as my chat stopped working and it was getting super laggy. Did anyone else have that? I figure that could of been related to why it was rushed
---
It was the patch that brought us LFD that did it.
---
I‚Äôm currently 32 and have no trouble. Make sure you‚Äôre in the lfg channel 5
---
Also, it prob depends on what spec your play. I‚Äôm a healer so it‚Äôs no prob, but if you‚Äôre a dps, you‚Äôre just not that hard to come across and if people are spamming dungeons from 30-40, you bet they aren‚Äôt looking for dps.
---
Went to a random tank with roll. Our MT cried.
---
Private server experience is better
---
Haven't tried it with RFK, but it's good to hear that it's doable.
---
Depends on how much time you have
---
You're blowing it out of proportion. Its a fucking video game go do something else for a few hours. Oh man you stopped people for playing WoW for a bit you should be beaten with a stick!
---
i killed the guads / pirates in the barrens farming linen cloth that i ended up with all the bag slot with bags.
---
Dind't even knew that thay dropped that (I checked, de %drop is less than 1%)
---
You are about to be intimate with both of them in about 24 levels!
---
Here, take mine.
---
also die in a fire if youre talking shit. They take the server down almost every morning. Also in game the first notice we got was 15 minutes til shutdown. So suck my dick.
---
Not very, as you level more your kill speed increases with catform. As well after you kill an enemy, you can shift out and heal then go back into bear, and your mana regens while in bear form which helps limit downtime.
---
Or enter a guild and ask for some
---
Define ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù. Full min maxed bear tanks could main tank all the raid content just fine. You‚Äôre wrong.
---
No growl should be on manual. It's a huge waste of DPS to have it on autocast. Once or maybe twice a fight is all you need. Get off your high horse if you can't even read the most basic hunter guide.
---
I can't wait, one day in the future, perhaps we will finally ditch Daylight Savings Time. It's just so useless nowadays, but messes with everyone every time.
---
Imagine how I felt when I was in org and looked up and saw there was a flippin Zeppelin there. I never saw the Zepp parked in org back in the day (probably because I had to have minimum draw distance on my potato)
---
So certain levels of leather/hide give certain amounts of proficiency? I know that I need certain level mobs give different hides. But does the act of skinning just give you a fixed amount of exp in proficiency.
---
What server you on? I have a few linen bags left in the bank I could mail you.
---
Yeah you're completely right and I think the best way to make people move is to remove some of the artificial band aids they've put in place to skew the queue times.  
---
Once these layers are removed the wait times on these full servers is going to be near impossible. In the meantime giving people a skewed perception of their wait times like things are getting better is not helping motivate the transfers..

Easy to do when server balance is seemingly 80/20 horde.

Other professions are more towards gold making and don't really have any combat bonuses.

Bruh chill, you can spend an hour not playing the game ffs

It seems it disappears currently, and it goes into limbo. When you dismount or get dismounted it pops out.
---
Seriously whats with everyone feeling compelled to post every lame snippet of chat they see ingame on the subreddit?
---
Stop.
---
If they want to do it, that's fine. Play the game whatever way you like, doesn't hurt me. But for the love of christ, they need to say so in their fucking messages! Just say LFM Mage! I'm getting so sick of it playing out as: 
---
LFMer: LFM DPS SM
---
Me: Hunter?
---
Braindead LFMer: no u idiot maeg only
---
Noob here. What does this mean?
---
Versus everyone else that you can just solo if they suck. But your real problem is just git gud son. /s
---
If any of the conventional dps classes puts down the same amount of gold and effort into consumables they‚Äôll outshine the paladin on the meters. I‚Äôd rather take a prepared paladin, showing up for each raid, than a warrior that doesn‚Äôt prepare or might not show.
---
This is the time I prepair breakfast, lunch and dinner for the leveling marathon that is about to take place.

I can hear these words

Check literally all of the highly upvoted posts on the front page

Are you in a guild so that you may join them in instance runs?
---
A  big thing in vanilla/classic is making and keeping social interactions.  Once you find someone or a group of people that you played well with, add them to your friends and try to do dungeons with them later.

Gnomes probably love this because it's the only time they can look down on someone.

"I'm a tall one"
---
This thread is usually near the top depending on sort order all week.
---
Not sure about the ratio, but I do know holy(?) priest get a talent that will increase their healing by a % of their total spirit, so it may vary depending on class?  For pure spellpower, from what I have seen is generally just from items, things that say Equip: increases damage and healing of spells and effects by XX for instance.  I don't think base spellpower is a thing until a future xpac.

thats a stupid fucking rule and i absolutely would and will need &amp; equip a boe upgrade for my gear.

What's your issue with the Twitch app?

I don't think the old curse ui has been updated or supports classic.

No, thats what the button with gold coin is for. If I intend to equip it I select need, in all other circumstances of 'Needing it' there's the other button. Don't try to defend scummy behaviour.

How can one get a hold of it?

fuck layers

They can never be as good because of crushing blows.  Druids simply can't avoid them, while warriors can.

Unreal Tournament 99, now THAT was a good game. *sips*

All he did was shut down a few servers for a couple of hours. No information was stolen, nothing significant was done. Unless the entire goal was to get everybody to bully some guy, then this is just some kid thinking it's funny and bragging about it.

I like you, lets have a coffee sometime

For real though.
---
Take a shower, get some food, go outside and look at a TREE.
---
If you can't live without WoW for **AN HOUR** seek professional help, the addiction is far too much for you.
---
You should migrate to Heartseeker. Population growing day by day, with 4k unique characters on the server and no problem finding dungeon groups. Great thing thus far is that there is very limited layering happening with a smaller group, which means materials actually sell well since there isnt much flooding going on in the AH. As far as phase 2 goes, ya there is a chance the server dies but I would rather take that risk than staying on a large server where the queue times will grow again because blizzards only solution to the problem is hoping people move.
---
it was most certainly the etiquette on the servers i played on in vanilla, im sure it was different per server
---
Sorry my vid editing isn't quite on par with others, hope you still enjoyed.  Just wanted to share something meaningful.  Thanks everybody :D

It‚Äôs an hour. Go take a shower nerd

Figured, thanks
---
Anyone have a resource for AUtionator/TSM shopping lists? Specifically interested in lower level twink BoE's and some materials that will go up in price in the future.
---
Ask Blizzard Customer Support, not us. When asked directly, they're usually open to giving compensation, ***if you be nice*** and have no bad record of cheating.
---
Horde only attacks me if they outnumber or outlevel me, literally in 6 days played.
---
Fuck layering only because world chat is spammed by mages asking for an inv
---
Ive only seen the "once someone gets a piece they pass on the next piece" philosophy with tight nit groups or extremely cool people. Definitely isn't common courtesy or custom. 
---
On top of that these guys were def doing SM arm. Aint no way in hell some shitty green the guy got before Herod (or even some boe blue with the way server prices are) can compare to Ravager. Asking someone to pass on that dope axe because they had gotten a green earlier in the run is just crazy. Would make more sense if they were spam farming, but no one flips out that way about losing a drop in a spam farming group.
---
Probably because of the DDoS attack.
---
There was a bit of an incident yesterday, in case you weren't paying attention.
---
Having a hard time getting Focused to load. Any tips?
---
Why is this so good? What does + weaponskill give in stats?
---
I thought they took it down to fortify their servers after the ddos attack yesterday?
---
Just to clarify - You will gain rested experience when logged off no matter what, but logging off at an inn grants rested exp at a much increased rate!
---
you seem like the type of guy who would complain during a ddos attack and then complain when they take the servers down to presumably to fix the area that was being attacked.
---
Gotcha thanks
---
I tanked SFK as a 26 enhancement shaman with no problem last night.  We steamrolled the whole dungeon and didn't even need to CC, but we had a priest healing which helps
---
But it's not going to benefit the group because it's a couple of random people not a guild. I can't believe people are actually debating this.
---
Check Heavy Leathert prices. It's used for bags do maybe It's worth auction them.
---
But for light and medium just vendor them.
---
Well it's not called the god damn Cave of Shadow
---
all things you never have to do in retail because travel is a non-issue, dungeons are either mostly linear or divided into bite-sized chunks that are much more difficult to get lost in, few mobs pose any actual threat while leveling...
---
i guess you can still do the nelf flip, yeah.
---
Accept that you can't hold threat against any DPS who outgears or outlevels you and is not considerate of you. This will be the case until the end of time. Any DPS who wants to draw threat will, proper tanking is a group task.
---
In easy dungeons: if you happen to lose threat on multiple mobs, make sure to put a skull on each group you pull, and then ignore that target. Some DPS will tank it just fine for a few seconds until it's dead. That gives you enough time to build threat on the rest of the group, and make sure most of the mobs stay where they should. Focussing on too many targets at once often means losing threat on more than one mob, and then you're pretty fucked.
---
When this doesn't work, because DPS can't tank the mob at all, then tell them to hold back and/or use CC.
---
You should be able to ask questions at any time but he simple question threads stay active all week so its best to post in here. It just depends on if people aren't in a mood to answer and then flag your question as "Low Effort" my reccomendation would be to ask in-game, join a guild and ask there. People are much nicer in guild chat than in General chat. So, that would be a good place to get many questions answered in the future.

People will have tons of suggestions about how to deal with certain scenarios and fear is a difficult one, interrupting a fear is the best you can do but its only against warlocks, other fears are instant and you have to deal with them by suffering through them and hoping they break, basically just evaluate what you can do once it stops. You can get a quick arcane shot off and maybe a concussive shot on a warrior to open the distance so he can't hit you. Most classes have to just suffer through fear, being Undead or a dwarf priest are exceptions but otherwise you hope it breaks, the next one will be shorter, and that the actions you take in between are enough to keep you alive to kill your opponent.

There's an intermittent issue where right click camera control will 'jump' to dead center before it starts the swivel. It's hard to tell that's what it's doing; it just feels like a spastic camera and I thought it was high sensitivity before figuring it out.

I'm on a full/high server and this hasn't been my experience at all. If anything there are more healers this time around, and finding good rogues has been inconsistent. Most LFG spam is of the normal variety ex. LF Tank
---
Mate, I want to run dungeons to do my quests and get an upgrade since I am very dependant on weapons.
---
I absolutely love questing and experiencing the game and just exploring the world.
---
As far as I know, all of the people were crying how they want to experience the game and now the same people are spamming 16 hours a day SM.
---
This min/maxing BS preventing me and many more people of finding a group and do a dungeon, LFG is filled with warrior cleaves and spell cleaves...
---
I'm definitely not trying to defend his actions, but I think they should clarify that somewhere in game because I could at least understand how someone new to the game might not be sure and roll need. I asked my first time though, instead of assuming.
---
Level 41 Druid- only have 70 gold. Travel form it is... *SIGH*
---
Greater magic wand is almost good and a good alternative if your having bad luck on drops. After lvl 23 I would just go to BFD since the wand from there is a quest reward and much better than cookies wand
---
It's DPS far exceeds anything else you can possibly get at 30... assuming you have help to actually get the axe.  It's impossible alone.  Getting it at 40, there are other options that are close enough where it doesn't make as much of a difference.
---
Wrath was mediocre. Ulduar and icc were good but icc went on way too long. T7 and T9 sucked. Wrath also gave us lfd and heroics handing out raid gear.
---
&gt; hours of maintenance 
---
Hours? AN hour, and even then every single day it has been immensely less than that. It'll be back up in a few minutes, this one is longer than usual but at least they're working **on a sunday**.
---
Debatable, even in vanilla everyone was trying to find faster ways to level and the consensus all the "pros" were telling us was that questing was the fastest way - especially with addon guides. So that's what everyone did.
---
Now its cleave farming.
---
It's fine to have nostalgia, but don't be fooled into thinking that in vanilla everyone was just strolling around smelling the roses, "enjoying the experience". Most people wanted to get to 60 as fast as possible, clear content as fast as possible - you were either slow and taking your time because you just didn't know any better, or you were rushing through content in the best way you knew how.
---
It's a necessary evil, layering has a negative impact on realms by way of economic impact and immersion, but it's better than the alternative of a nigh unplayable mess of obscene overpopulation the game would be without it. It's already kind of hard sometimes to find a zone not full to the brim with people grinding even with layers.

If you are on this sub, yes.

I like how we can look at the original version of this photo and be like "The small guy stands a chance. He might be some super badass hero or something!"  But in all reality, the big dude just has to sneeze or fart and the "hero" is done for.

---
Maybe it also had something to do with the DDOS attacks. I‚Äôm sure Blizzard will schedule with hackers better forward - just for you dear
---
Stance dancing becomes viable with tactical mastery from arms.
---
Charge group, thunderclap, switch to defensive stance, Sunder and taunt if needed. 
---
Battle shout gives threat for buffing the party, demo shout gives debuff threat. You‚Äôll need to practice to get used to how much you need of what.
---
With tactical mastery you have a backup taunt, you can switch to battle stance and use mocking blow in a pinch when taunt is on cool down and you really need to get something off a group member right now.
---
Unless you‚Äôre the opposing faction. Then you get mc‚Äôd off the boat.
---
Seriously?
---
Melee cleave is alive and well, not sure what server you are on, but if you are horde and a rogue, you should be in melee cleave groups pretty easy with WF.
---
What's up with the comment on the bottom?
---
Shadow Priests, if played right are pretty killer in 1v situations.  hard to kill, can heal, shield, renew, dots, heals off damage, can dispel, can burn your mana to zero in a few seconds...
---
Raid wise, in vanilla after 1.6 I was allowed to do a priest spec after arguing my point that I could hang with the disc/holy specs, and the guild trusted me, so they let me do a 18/2/31.  Id weave when able with swp 1, or another low rank spell to just stack it up then maintain it when possible.  Very rare to see a shadow priest DPSing in a raid, but I had a few occasions where the GM told me to go all out and DPS and would throw me in with the Locks.  The two compliment eachother VERY well.  I do believe it's still one of the best 2s group compositions.

IT workers in general are pretty much 100% FSLA exempt. Like software engineers are explicitly listed on the US DoL guidelines. They're only included in FSLA if you pay them less than like $25K a year, and I've never met a software developer that makes less than like $50K (script monkies at small colleges, etc.).

In the US at least there's no federal requirement that you get paid OT.

Try the level 30 Worgens in south Duskwood.  Usually Horde would have to go out of their way to spot you here -- 61,80 coordinates -- roughly.

You Sir Dragon do not fight with honor!

I‚Äôve never even seen that many ALLIANCE in Stormwind.  I‚Äôm guessing whitemane has a little bit of a faction imbalance?
---
I believe for PvP, a faster attack speed helps interrupt/delay casters. For PvE it's meaningless since they proportionally have lower damage to make up for their faster attacks (in the same pet family).
---
Hey brotha sorry for late reply on this one! I think it will realistically go for around 200g+ once economies stabilize. People will be investing in twink items first, but once everyone has their BoEs, mounts, and twinks the market for these pets will go up.

&gt; I can't raid that late, though, I have to wake up at 6am on a Sunday to mow my lawn.

I can sympathize with this, although today it was vacuuming and house chores. Finally sat down to play around 9:45 to a notice that the servers were coming down, ugh.
---
I gotta mow the lawn yet but I have to put a new spindle on the mower first and I've been being lazy/cheap since I don't have a socket the size of the spindle nut haha.

As a rogue, probably not.

Thanks! That's pretty cool.

Some people like to take their time, read the quests and do things at their own pace - some people like to minmax and be as efficient as possible.

if you're going to be questing in a group / hitting dungeons, I prefer fire for its damage output.

if you're going to be questing solo, I prefer frost for its utility and slows/snares.

Why not both?

Lmao every instance I do this

what happened?
---
Feral druids are very low gear dependent because your weapons don't matter. They are just stat sticks. But druids also scale incredibly well on both agi and str. Bear is a bit slow, cat gets better.
---
the main reason imho was that on pservers  it is free to have not one, not two but as many accounts as you want.  These kind of players often had multiple lvl 60s on both factions, on different accounts, essential to communicate and spy.  (not necessary all levelled by themself, after all it's a kartel, they share accounts)  
---
All this is harder and very expensive in the official game, so I doubt it will be a big issue.
---
Hunter pet question. Why would I ever want to use Claw while leveling? Since it costs 25f and has no cooldown, it consumes all my pet‚Äôs focus, leaving hardly any to use Growl on cooldown. Since my pet can‚Äôt Growl, I occasionally take aggro.
---
Also, even if I‚Äôm in a group with a tank and have Growl off, then turn on Claw, my pet never has enough focus to use Bite since it‚Äôs more expensive at 35f.
---
Claw and Bite combo just kinda seems jank. Can anyone explain this to me?

Although he has a fair point that it's longer than usual. Typically, it's like 5 minutes or so.

The age group of people born between 1946‚Äì1964 (highly debated exact years though) are called "Baby Boomers" due to the amount of children born from that age group. Generation X came after it, with Generation Y following, those 2 generations are the most debated, but both of them are sorta considered the Millennial generation by the general public. Officially, X has no term, but Y is "Millennial". I personally am 20, making me part of Generation Z (which started in 1996, debated), and the term Zoomer comes from the fact that this generation seems to always be in a rush, due to how society has changed over the years. Zoomer is also a play on the word Boomer, causing the "Boomer vs Zoomer" stuff we see now.

Speaking of old stuff. Can you still walk jump with the ornate spy glass trick from back in the day?  I was able to ‚Äúhack‚Äù my way into many areas just by jumping using that trick.
---
Thats why you end up with multiple level 19s
---
Did something similar in WoD when we had the burst of speed talent. It allowed me to keep up with someone on their ground mount while I maintained stealth. They killed me while questing, I dedicated the next 30 minutes of my life to fucking with him and killing him, in the end he had a full five man squad of max levels guarding him.

As well as best hair, hair-hair, beard-hair, chest-hair and asscrack-hair ;p

This might be a really stupid question, but where in the world do you see your fishing level? I was assuming that it was on your skills tab, but it seems like for every fish i catch i gain a level? Is that right?

Nice! Now ding to level 20 and... it's gone.

"lul git gud" hahaha

You are the guy complaining about layer hop. Just play the fucking game
---
That is the appropriate action to take. It teaches them that they can't ninja loot, AND it makes 3 other players hopefully remember their name. That ninja looter might not care in the moment, but they are potentially missing out on BoP items due to not continuing the dungeon, and making a name for themselves as a ninja looter. Keep screenshots of it, too, because then you can provide a link to raid leaders in the future if you see the ninja's name in a raid.
---
Yeah. Unfortunately Ashenvale does not have the best quest for alliance. It's disappointing because it such a beautiful zone and it's where you're directed to as a night elf.
---
When phase 2 rolls around the world pvp will be outrageous, don‚Äôt worry

I haven't tried it in Classic yet, but in Retail, I've used Clique and Grid for years and it does it. It will show the value of incoming heals on the health bars.

They are. I got this at the 15 second warning.
---
The person who posted this like a week ago the person was doing 10s for anywhere in the zone and then extra for going out of zone I believe
---
Truth hurts.
---
Always has been and always will be. People who like pvp are pre disposed to picking horde you can tell because of the way it is.
---
Real outlaws don't care about DKs.   Its just a number
---
While unfortunate I'd hardly call it assinine given the circumstances.
---
Order of the Stick? ;)
---
This should be the standard policy for potential twink items. I think as people get closer to 60, it should change, because gear is likely to last longer and may even stick around for early raiding. 
---
But a 10-29 BoE blue? 100% everyone should need. Anyone who equips that item is just not being logical. A twink will buy them item and use it forever- a normal levelling player will outgrow it in like 10 hours played or so. Seems pretty obvious who should be using it.
---
Keep SWP on them first and foremost to prevent stealthing, even if it's Rank 1 if you're low mana.  Mind Control, yep... they always WOTF out of it for some reason, and when they do, wait 5 seconds, THEN fear.  Redo dots, then MC again to let it tick, and let Fear's cooldown reset more before he's back on you.  
---
You'll find that every rogue is in a way tricky since they all have their own little tactics in PVP.  I suggest dueling them often to get the hang of it.
---
Eh, I have zero problem with anyone grieving these AOE farmers.  I plan to grief the ones on my own faction in a few levels.
---
Install them both and then uninstall BFA?
---
classic wow is the most casual friendly "expansion" in wow. there are no such things as catch up mechanics, where you stop and take a break is exactly where you come back to, take a year to get to level 60, it doesn't matter. people will still run molten core every week, even with naxx out. the apes killed ragnaros and onyxia with most of their raid below level 60, onyxia they didn't even have 40 people. classic is a linear progression in the sense that nothing will ever become obsolete until you yourself outgear it.
---
Hey, selfish twit, some people have characters they cant access because of the DDoS yesterday and Blizzard Support told them Realm Maintenance was the only way to fix it. Pipe down.
---

---
I know this channel exists. It still takes forever to group compared to lfg. And I‚Äôm not sure how spamming a channel is any more rpg than having a built in group finder.
---
&gt; Such as what? You're positing that depriving them of the attention they're seeking might drive them to do something potentially worse, right? I can't imagine you'd argue that as a reason AGAINST what I'm saying unless you have some idea in your mind of what they might do next. Otherwise, what's the point in your disagreement?
---
I didn't say not giving them attention is worse, I'm disagreeing that you think it's wrong to give them attention. Not to equate script kiddies with spree shooters, but several of those in the past started with edgy statements online. Obviously I'm not saying look into people making the edgy statements and give them attention, but if attention really is what they're seeking and they don't get it from one action, does it not stand to reason that they might (not necessarily will) try harder or something else to gain that?
---
&gt; I was saying that them graduating to a new crime isn't going to be worse overall. Not only do I doubt this person has the knowledge or access to do something worse, but anything that they MIGHT graduate to would probably make it easier for them to be caught. So again, ignoring the attention whore would be a win-win for us.
---
Keyword there being MIGHT. Lack of attention might lead them to continuing or graduating their actions and so might the attention. And in this case it seems the people giving this guy the attention spurred him on to continue which I'm sure only helped authorities to track his IP faster, so I don't see how you can say it's wrong one way or another.
---
&gt; So do you have some reason to think that he's not seeking attention? What else does he get from this, exactly? And if he wasn't seeking attention, why would he make a Twitter and Tweet at big streamers and big corporations about his actions?
---
I never said that. I don't understand how you think if someone is looking for attention and isn't receiving it that they'll just automatically stop.
---
&gt; What does this even mean? Do you think that Blizzard had no idea what was going on? Or that they didn't take the necessary actions immediately? A simple call to the FBI or whoever you call in this case will suffice.
---
Never said that Blizz didn't, and I did say earlier that people were notifying the FBI as well. When I say "authorities" I'm including both Blizz, the FBI and any other organization that has authority over this situation, if one of these parties already has the information then whatever but it certainly doesn't hurt to make sure others do as well.
---
&gt; The mob mentality here ONLY serves the attention seeker. It doesn't help Blizzard or the authorities because the general public has a lot less information about what's happening behind the scenes here.
---
I agree the general public has less information, and I never said mob mentality solves crimes. The authorities should always take what the public says with a grain of salt. With that understanding though, I don't see how the public providing potentially false or misinformed information will hurt if the authorities have a better handle on the case.
---
&gt; Best case scenario, it's just spamming Blizzard's customer service channels, which might not be directly linked to the groups that are fixing the issue, but it still creates a mess that they have to deal with on another front.
---
Customer service in this case already had the mess to deal with simply by virtue of the game servers being down, that's their job in the first place. It doesn't make it any better or worse if the people complaining to CS also include potentially false information about who they think is responsible.
---
&gt; No. Please tell me why you do.
---
Well gee, if people hadn't raised a stink about making official Classic WoW servers, do you think Blizz would have ever walked back on their "you think you do but you don't" position? It generally makes sense to at least listen to issues raised by your target audience even if you think they are misinformed and you already have a plan of action.
---
&gt; You watch WAY too many movies, sir. Have you seen any of the videos Blizzard has made about their physical "command center" where they monitor their servers and networks? Let me assure you that the "Guard falls asleep while the bad guys are on the security camera" trope is just a Hollywood slapstick situation and would never happen in a REAL data security environment like the one in Blizzard HQ.
---
I was more so using a hypothetical scenario, the point is that it's not wrong for the general public to react to issues that pop up by communicating with the authorities even if they already have a handle on it, and it has the potential even if only slightly to help solve it more quickly in the unlikely event that the authorities don't immediately have knowledge of it.
---
And I mentioned I would grab them if they were real... I meant that white claws in general are pretty solid. Mango and black cherry ftw
---
str+agi, both are very strong. Some stamina and spirit doesn't hurt either. INT is kinda meh since you are a sustain class, that rarely drinks. Int is only really good for those kill 2-5 mobs then drink classes like shaman/mage.
---
 Go outside
---
And my point is I don't see how their notoriety benefits them or harms others beyond being offended by the crime (which they already are even if they didn't know who was responsible). That perceived position of power is nothing more than a 15 minutes of fame followed by the highly probable consequences, which if in this case is jailtime like the last time this happened means the guy won't be able to do anything else to gain attention for a long time and people will just forget about it a week later.
---
Entitled much?
---
Yeah this is my first experience with wow. I took a chest without a thought because people had run past. No rolls in chat, I guess they just missed it. One guy lost his mind over it, so I opened trade and offered all the stuff (it was all garbage aside from two mana pots) but he just said "it's obviously more important to you".
---
OK then man...

damn. ive already got add ons that do what grid does, aside from that.

Burning crusade is where it started with daily quests rep grinds(login because you have to not because you want to), achievements (directed gameplay not organic anymore), flying (rip world PvP), 25 man raids,  and the list goes on.

Played Everquest for most of the last 20 years. Have a baby now so figured I would try Classic WoW as it seemed more solo and less playtime friendly.

I'm rerolling into a PvE server because I don't have time to get ganked anymore and a lot of people love camping for fun. What's the primary PvE server for Horde, that doesn't have a lot of streamers? Going to roll either a Mage or another Enhance Shammy.
---
Thanks in advance.
---
I havent geared a shaman but from what I see it's not too bad - some of your resto pve pieces are good for ele/resto, some of the pvp rewards, too and at least some of the rest are items that arent as sought after by other classes.
---
Sure, your bis overlaps other casters' bis for multiple items but you are not that much worse off with the alternatives.
---
Yesssss this is awesome!! This is how it should be. I feel like layering killed a any chance of fun World PvP
---
Now this is the downtime shitposting I'm here for
---
Anyone who uses the word triggered without being entirely sarcastic just makes me feel sad. What a life.
---
Are you ugly, do you have trouble meeting people at parties?  Yeah I thought so.
---
If its an upgrade, need it. tanks dont have a monopoly on 1hs
---
Make sure to do Duskwood. I rolled Horde for Classic but made an Alliance toon specifically to do that zone again. It was easily my favorite pre-Cata zone. The ambiance is amazing, good stories, and always have to watch out for Stitches walking down the main road.
---
I always played, if you need the item, then need on it. Straight up. An item can be an upgrade for multiple people, that's what the roll system is for.
---
not exactly. there are coefficients - https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/95abc8/list_of_spellcoefficients_1121/

Just honored. When PVP ranking comes out, you get a further 10% discount for ranking... I think it's 3? I could be wrong on that. Right now you only get 10% discount for honored, though.

What sucks for immersion is everyone looking like complete clowns with randomly coloured gear, completely different dual wielded weapons, etc. Plus it actually adds another think for you to set out to do, to grab some gear that you think looks cool so you can wear it for visuals, instead of just purely grinding the best stats. Without transmogging the visuals on everything in the game is completely pointless, the devs may as well make all the gear blue and red depending on the faction and not give a shit about what it looks like.
---
100% incorrect. In Vanilla you can DE any item regardless of your skill.
---
Nothing significant was done?  Damages doesn‚Äôt only include information being stolen.  Loss in revenue is a clearly a damage, plus with the way these attacks work there was collateral damage that you don‚Äôt know about as the upstream providers tried to handle the load of some kid buying someone else‚Äôs botnet for the lulz.  Kids going to get caught and kid will go to jail.
---
You know, you can unlock the player and target frames (top left) and just drag them down left and right of your character, right?
---
I think most people are saying if Blizz does "TBC Classic" then they want seperate servers, so that people have the choice of keeping their classic toons, with perhaps the option of "copying" your character over to the TBC Classic server.
---
This whole thing seems a little weird tbh. We spend 15 years playing a game and then they just re-release all the same content for the next 15 years? That'd be weird :P  
---
I think Classic's lifespan would get as far as WotLK before it died altogether.

My suggestion is go retribution as it is the fastest leveling spec. When you get to your 40's consider respeccing to prot or concentration prot to do some aoegrinding with the possibility to tank dungeons too
---
It is going to be longer than all these power gamers expect. So I wouldn't worry to much. There is no fiscal reason for them to release content faster than the  originally did. The entire point is to make money. So they want more sub time, not less.

Is Engineering that beneficial in the end game? I'm not planning on a lot of PvP (despite being on a pvp server) nor raiding. Just doing dungeons and might make it to 60, eventually.

Why even bother with differentiating BoPs then? They have vendor value. Need everything. Be absolutely mercenary. Fuck everyone else in the group.

I like giving lowbies my highest rank fortitude. Watching their hp double tickles me.
---
there are few mechanics that actually need to be avoided/interrupted and people just don't and end up dying and the tank goes: "???" I don't even answer, like check you combat logs. I feel like a lot of people are running dungeons like its BFA where healers dont ever go oom and tanks can aoe tank as easily as singe target

Right, so when you're full blues,  it take 5 frost bolts to kill a target.  Then when you're full nax gear, it self levels, or scales, to again take 5 frost bolts to kill the same target. So gear no longer matters, it dosen't make it any more challenging, just always the same.  What's the point of getting stronger if nothing changes.  That's a huge rpg element taken out of the game.  
---
Now you could bring tiered gear closer together, making the next only minor upgrades from the last.  This would make old content last longer.  Eventually you just need to move on to new content and there's nothing wrong with that.
---
I was under the impression that layering was going away when pvp released
---
Thanks man I feel the same.  I did get them good, I appreciate the kind words.
---
follow andy lmao
---
This all may be true, but you shouldn't blame yourself for the group wiping. If you weren't pulling any extra groups or pulling as a dps (especially when the healer was low on mana), the other people in your group were most likely at fault as well. 
---
If the one thing you were doing wrong was stripping one mob in the pull from the tank, then there must have been other stuff going wrong to cause a bunch of wipes in SFK. Either they were pulling like it's retail and then were surprised when that didn't work out or something else silly like that. Maybe your tank and healer were under leveled. I don't really know, but my point is I wouldn't take it to heart. 
---
Just pretty please make sure your pet isn't on aggressive (I suggest a /petattack macro) and that it's taunt is turned off if it has one.

The first of the sets of rolls don't 'Just Happen'. They themselves have a 1/100 probability to land on any specific number. So you have to include them. You don't just get to pass on adding the probability on the roll.
---
Just honered and another 10% from rank 3 pvp
---
Every group I've been in has done this differently (need vs greed), and almost always there are people on both sides of the fence. I've been told "all greed on blue/purp BoE" only to see one guy roll need and ninja an 80g item. Other groups have said BoE upgrades should only be needed by those who will equip, but I've seen someone need on a BoE blue worth like 35g only to see them replace it within the hour. Not to mention the people who claim they need for upgrade, then they don't equip it at all and later you see them trying to sell on AH or trade chat.
---
Everyone is complaining about how unfair it is when someone does something like OP posted - can someone explain to me why it's more fair to put all the agency on what amounts to possibly huge piles of gold dropping in the hands of players who you absolutely cannot trust to do the right thing, and will likely replace that item for a huge gold loss in a level or two?
---
What's the most fair thing for everyone? It's simply ALL ROLL NEED. Say it before hand, if someone gets upset because an item they'd equip would drop, it's absolutely selfish on their part to think everyone should pass on a big gold opportunity that is an infrequent occurrence for everyone involved. If someone wins the item and wants to give it up to someone in the group who says they want it, that's wonderful! Everyone got a shot at and distribution was fair. No one can ninja when all roll need, and if a player wins and decides not to give the mage the 50g item that just dropped for free because it has INT, well, that's his decision.
---
The most fair thing for everyone is all need, change my mind.
---
Did I just see the birth of a new copy pasta?
---
K. You can also hit C and then go to 'skills' if you're like me and can never remember to press K lol.

Original Everquest was like this. 
---
I played EQ instead of wow when it came out. 
---
I wish EQ would do a classic release like this again.
---
To my knowledge they have not directly addressed cross-server battlegrounds, aka Battlegroups. However, Battlegroups were introduced in patch 1.12, which is the version we know they'll be using for things like Alterac Valley from the start of Phase 3 (when battlegrounds themselves are introduced) so I think it's probably a safe bet that they're coming sooner or later.
---
I felt pretty baller the other day because a priest gave my rogue the fort buff so I turned and used a scroll of int I happened to have for him.
---
26 in Disc down to Spirit.  25 in Holy, last 5 being the Spirit % to healing one.
---
First 5 points in wands since you're solo lvling at the low lvls, then grab 2 points in Holy for healing interrupt.  Those 2 points I consider mandatory no matter the spec I do, because if I have a whole school of spells which are reliant on not being hit, that's a huge survivability problem.  
---
I don't waste points on Threat reduction either.  I got fade, and just watch myself.  Chances are the DPS are going to pull agro before I will.
---
Classic cast bars I think is the one I use.
---
You probably need to wait a few seconds after the tank engages to let him build some solid threat before you start blasting
---
It doesn't prevent but makes it harder. Without layering there would be few times more people roaming around. This makes it MUCH easier for fights and big battles to start.
---
Currently there might be some horde that want to pvp on layer 2 and alliance that want to pvp on layer 5. They are not gonna meet each other so a fight is less likely to happen.
---
Don't pay attention to the timer. It's literally an estimate based on the average amount of people logging off at any given point. If the people currently playing stay in game longer, the time will go up.
---
If you can use it and it's an upgrade, you can need. If you just want it for the money or whatever, you can greed.
---
Horde here on Netherwind.   
---
I see ya, I see ya...   
---
Haha, but no really Alliance out number us here at the moment. Hopefully we get some more transfers here.

You know Gnomeregan was rigged right?

That's the plan isn't it?

What party frame is that?

I mean if every single person was a "nice dude" and a real member of the classic community you wouldn't have 15 year old terms like huntard, ninja looter or various other negative stereotypes.

---
You can actually just walk up to the mountains from Dun Morogh. There's no way to get to the cave though, as far as I know.
---
In this situation I need, and if I win it I let the others who did not roll need to reroll and give them the item if they roll higher. If a person wins it and wants to equip it or give it to somebody else to equip that's on them. If 3/5 of the party wants to let somebody have it to equip, there's a good chance that will happen. The most equitable option is to roll need as it has the highest chance of being fair.  
---
What if you roll greed and 2 others who can't use it roll need? Taking the item into your custody to then discuss and distribute fairly is a hallmark of community focused loot distribution. It's pretty equitable and I'm pretty surprised that people are downvoting, I feel like most veteran vanilla players understand this loot method as it's practically all I ever encountered when playing vanilla back in the day.

That‚Äôs awesome
---
Warlocks do great dps. But there could be plenty of reasons why someone might be doing better than you. Is your gear out of date? Sometimes other classes get power spikes at certain levels, like when they first learn a strong ability. I wouldn't stress too much unless you're consistently below the tank.
---
Thanks Dave, keep on being dangerous bro

Lots of people in this thread are pointing to the dungeon finder -- and they aren't wrong.
---
But another huge moment in the end of the original game was introducing paid faction changes in Wrath. These got rid of previous restrictions, and allowed transfers between PvE and PvP servers, as well as allowing accounts to have characters of both factions on a PvP server. The sense that servers had a unique "community" died with that change.
---
And to understand why what seems like a small thing ended up having such an outsize impact, you need to remember how important Wintergrasp was. Winning Wintergrasp was how you accessed the world bosses -- and those world bosses dropped both tier pieces *and* PvP set pieces. So winning WG and running Vault of Archavon each week was really important for both PvE and PvP progression. 
---
Before the dilution of the PvE/PvP server divide it was common for servers to have guilds of both factions who were in the race for raid progress. Afterwards, however, most guilds on the "losing" side just swapped to the winning faction in order to have a big recruitment base, and in order to get a more reliable shot at running VoA each week. Most PvP servers went from having more-or-less "balanced" populations, to being dominated by one faction, often seeing 80-90% belonging to one faction.
---
During Wrath, Wintergrasp was by far my favorite thing, and I'd often see the same enemy players over and over. You'd get to know their tactics and their tendencies, you'd know which guilds would use druids to kill the keep's guns and which would stack demolishers at max range. You'd see the same paladin defending the back towers, and the same rogues harassing people in mid.
---
And all that went away within weeks of paid faction transfers. WG became embarrassingly lopsided. And the sense that servers each had their own unique communities died, as people ponied up some cash to chase gear drops from Vault of Archavon.
---
So, yeah -- LFD was the nail in the coffin. But as far as I'm concerned, paid faction transfers ***built*** the coffin.
---
In PVE faster attack speeds create ‚Äúthreat‚Äù more quickly, which keeps the mob attacking your pet, and not you. This is important so the hunter can stay ranged and use more powerful attacks that also create ‚Äúthreat‚Äù, but at a lesser extent than the pet. But also in PVP, for the aforementioned reason in this thread
---
One thing not to worry about is decisions! No decision you make about your character is permanent.
---
Talent points that unlock new abilities and passives can be reset, although it goes become very costly.
---
Likewise, if you learn a profession and decide you don't like it, you can forget it and learn a new one.
---
You can't make too many "wrong" decisions. Sure, some talents are better than others but just play how you enjoy and worry about switching it up to something more efficient either if you get stuck or once you get to level 60.
---
Oh and join a leveling guild!
---
Right, that is a massive waste of time
---
I wasn't group leader and didn't really think it would be an issue. Probably my fault for not starting my own group. Rest of group was mage, lock and priest. So I figured as long as I asked Shaman what he planned on rolling for I was good. I would totally understand if someone didn't want to run with me or a group kicks me because I don't wanna compete. I don't understand why people are so offended at this idea, especially when I am being straightforward. I understand how other classes want loot to be better. But if I started rolling on leather gear as tank because it was better, I imagine people would be upset. Especially post 40 and considering alot of leather is BiS for warrior and fury wars go for it. I wouldn't take a high stam ring that had agi just because it worked for me. I want my group to get better gear and I won't be trying to steal stuff that is more efficient and a bigger step up for someone else.
---
#1 is let me cast. It auto dismounts you.
---
Yep, just be very conservative with your mana and drink whenever you can.
---
I hope you didn't equip that. That sells for a couple hundred gold for the lower twink bracket. Iirc it's an agility Stam back piece with bis stats. When phase three and four come around people will be looking for that.
---
You‚Äôre an idiot

Bonus! It's evident I was the one helping and not the actual Warrior

Yes but you'll need a set full of int gear to do it

You can tank WC with a hunter or warlock pet.

You would have to be truly abysmal to sabotage such easy dungeons.

Rando Warlock ran up to me, opened trade, and gave me a healthstone with a nice little letter attached. The letter only had one word in it: "n-word"
---
Poly is good, unless one of the players is a druid then they're pretty much fucked. 
---
Also at higher levels poly breaking trinkets are pretty common.
---
1. Yes, but you can tank as fury or arms for 5 mans easily.
---
2.  If your race has specific extra skill in a certain type of weapon (orcs have axe skill, humans have sword skill), use those unless you find a weapon of another type that is significantly better.
---
3. It seems like theres no true well established opinion on what stats are the best for leveling. Just don't use intellect, it's almost completely useless for you.
---
You have to close out the client and reopen for them to load.
---
Oooooh money money
---
Holy shit. Either you were price gouged or the economy for your server is in a very strange place. That‚Äôs stupidly expensive. What server?
---
Do you edit too?
---
I try to wait and see what everyone rolls. If someone says they need it and roll need, I'll see if everyone else rolls greed. If someone tries to roll need to take it for gold, I'll roll need so I can give it to the person that needs it. If everyone greeds, I greed. easy peasy

Sorry, my understanding was that pressing the mount keybind doesn‚Äôt dismount you.

Also, if you are focusing on your dots make sure they arent getting wasted by mobs being killed too quick. If group is killing fast probably just stick to direct damage otherwise you get like 1 tick of your dots before mob dies.

Just remember to take pet off aggressive in dungeons lmao.

I play a warlock, I am presently level 19.
---
i use a macro i made:
---
IN dungeons:
---
/castsequence curse of agony(rank) , corruption , immolate 
---
Out of dungeons, I add fear to the mix, after corruption.   
---
I noticed that the macro goes through the cycle, so if something is resisted it will go to step 2, etc..   is there  a way to introduce conditionals? or is there a way to reset the sequence?either way, would you recommend any tweaks to said macros?  ill add siphon health DoT when i get it.
---
Switching to healing spec before 60, or 50+ where you plan to dungeon a lot, isn't really recommended. You can heal just fine in shadow or disc damage specs up to the and will be much more efficient solo leveling. I'd suggest maybe you need to look up priest rotations for your level to see if your being mana efficient. Is your wand up to date and your gear focused on spirit? Check talent choices too
---
Last night I was running through stone talon and a Druid chased me down to buff thorns on me, yelling oh no you don‚Äôt! Get back here!

Use the addon prat. Automatically does it, allows you to copy links in gchat and makes life easier

Everyone that took skinning has just as much a right to skin as you do no matter what they are going to do with the leather. For you it's to help level your leatherworkong for them it's to fund their mount and professions. Why don't people get this?
---
Nothing you can do.  Best to cut your loses and regroup and reset the dungeon right away.
---
Like any vendor? Or a certain one in particular? I haven't played in years I forgot how vending worked

Titan panel has a setting for this.

What is the addon to see party members health bars to click on as a healer in dungeons?

It's bagnon :)

I mean... you killed a bunch of grey alliance... it‚Äôs not impressive at all. So... way to go?... I guess?...

Doesn‚Äôt really show any skill tbh.

Congrats ! Would you mind giving a fellow Warrior some tips on how you got the gold, please ?
---
lmao..
---
I first got kicked offline about 2 hours ago, maybe 3
---
Uldaman loot sucks for rogues, unless you get a lucky roll on the ring. But it is great xp and overall a fun dungeon. And you can solo the elite quests in the mines outside the instance while lfg. Also the dwarf fort just to the South is a great place to level lockpicking.
---
If you had a cat, you'd understand the sacrifices you have to make to ensure they're comfortable.
---
The easy way to make money is farm. You solo kill mobs instead of quest or dungeon. That's pretty much it. If you're duo, or running with guild members it'll be next to impossible. STV is a good farm spot, the tigers drop whiskers that sell for about 75s a stack. Playing solo = more money.
---
That being said, I'm 42 and sitting on 10g. Most of my guild is feeling the same, most are getting mounts at 43/44. The guys who went out solo and farmed got their mounts at 40.
---
You will lose subscriber
---
A fellow man of culture! Know what I do against these? Howl of terror their mobs, watch them die :D
---
I was only reading the LFM SM Armory advertisement and trying to figure it out
---
1. Prot is short for Protection, which is the tank talent tree. So not all tanks will be prot, but most prot warriors will be tanks. It specifically means a warrior specced down the protection tree. You can tank while leveling in other builds.
---
2. No, use whatever has the best stats. For warrior you want something with good dps for aggro generation and preferably some stamina on it.
---
3. The Wowhead Classic Warrior Guide has some weapon suggestions. Besides that, it's probably best to ask something like "I'm level x and I'm using y-weapon, is there anything I can get that's better?"
---
If you haven‚Äôt yet created a character on the server then you seem to be in a lower priority queue than people that do have characters on it.
---
Typical alliance scum, can't fight unless there's a bunch of them.
---
Poor kitty, just looking for honorable fights.

At least Swifty is wholesome.

Same. I'm glad I read this I actually worried that people were getting annoyed with my drive by buffing/heals. I'm new to WoW in any form (husband recruitment) and don't entirely know the etiquette yet so I've just been buffing all the things.
---
Meh, i never have the patience to move the volume necessary to profit from lvling tailoring with avg margins. TOo often too many things sell below cost bc people are just skilling up, then the best stuff has small margins and you eventually reduce urself to selling mooncloth CDs when you can be fukt to.
---
you can basically level as any spec, it won't change much. I personally that shadow talents are not useful in early levels.  Like improved SWP sounds good but the mobs usually before my nonimproved shadow word pain runs out, so the talent points are wasted.  Your rotation doest actually change. Shield, smite,swp,mb, wand. I prefer a hybrid disc/holy for increased survivability

There are beasts everywhere and the market is flooded with leather right now, the mats are dirt cheap on every server. In fact it's so cheap the my friend is buying all that he can, crafting an item, then vendoring it for a profit.
---
They were removed when we got the armored versions, very early on, and Blizzard decided not to add them back into classic due to them wanting us to not feel forced to level and make gold super quick and throw our premade plans out the window. I understand the reasoning, but it's still a shame :p

Also we never got a 1.14 patch whut.

You can bind pet attack to any key. So you can bind a key on your rotation or one you don't use to make pet management easier without using macros.

Even those items.  If the person can use it, its theirs, and compete with anyone else who can use it.  It's a dick move to roll Need for profit, just as it's a dick move to say you're going to equip a BoE you needed on and then you turn around and sell it.

Maybe you should bring more attention to what I'm supposed to be looking at

I think they are the biggest guild on the server yeah? At least on the horde side I think. One of my guildmates used a census thing and I think we are pretty close behind them.
---
Yeah my MO has been to put dots on the 2-3 mobs pulled and then do direct damage on the one that has the most sunder stacks to avoid pulling aggro. It seems to work, and my mana is fine, but it still seems like say a mage will do their firebolt and do like a third of the mobs health while I have to chip away with dots.

Clearly!

That's evil, and amazing. I have a new favorite pastime. Of course it'll be poor horde not making the departure time.

What I've noticed is that this bug happens quite a lot when I don't get the night/day-time fish for quite a while. Almost like if it exchanges those fish loots with this empty-bug.
---
Additional Info: I still did get points for fishing when I had empty loot. Which should not happen as you only get points when you actually catch something.
---
The alternative isnt as great as youd think. I play on a pvp aerver and STV is unbelievably congested. You cant go anywhere without 6 other people murdering all quest mobs and camping spawns.
---
Go help
---
If he's playing PvP I don't think that's a good idea
---
Yea cause there is so much detail to be seen in this picture. Its like the Mona Lisa....
---
I'm so glad you enjoyed it, thank you for commenting :)
---
Tiddys is in my guild! I hope he gets there soon!

Time changes deal with it

Demonology ?

This is why I always say "need on all boe blues and purples ok? Prevents ninja" at the start of every dungeon. Everyone has agreed so far.
---
Turn off all the extras like AA etc, lower your resolution, lower any graphics settings you haven't lowered.
---
This isn't the same client and graphics that we had in vanilla, it has the improved lighting and rendering - it's system requirements are not what they were in 2004.
---
No, it is etiquette for rogues to unlock them and then everyone rolls like a normal chest.
---
Already a binding of windseeker drop on my server
---
I think this is what OP meant.
---
Get an addon called necrosis. U can set it up to auto delete shards once u get a certain amount. It does other warlocky stuff too
---
Apparently the popular method is AOE/cleave SM &amp; other instances then keep repeating.
---
People always find the first enemies closest to town that drop their quest item and fight 5 other people for the mobs, when most of the time you can go a couple hundred yards in another direction and find a whole other group of the mobs you need with less people there. I'm pretty sure Redridge is filled with boars, find those boars instead of fighting a group of 20's for the spawns at one location where boars are.
---
Hillsbrad Foothills will fill in some of the gap left by Stonetalon. If you haven't, do dungeons for some gear (SFK). Hillsbrad will also have some that unlock around level 30, so you can go back after 1k Needles.
---
Alright thanks, will try to find something like that
---
Ah so he was being a douche. Good to know.
---
are you below level 10?
---
ran by a guy who took a name i wanted, was cool to see someone else appreciated TES: Morrowind.
---
You can just stick to Stonetalon, Ashenvale, Hillsbrad, southern Barrens, dipping into Thousand Needles a bit. But the rate at which you get quests completed in each zone is faster than the rate at which you level. You can just grind some mobs in your zone of choice to make up for this, but i would recommended hopping from zone to zone doing the quests that are green and yellow for you. It will actually be faster (or at least less frustrating) than attempting to do red quests after you've done all the yellow ones in a zone. This will also help you get flight paths that you're going to need to get eventually, which will make future travelling easier (especially when you get around to doing class quests). I also think it's more fun in general to travel the world meeting new people doing dungeons as you go in and out of zones etc.
---
Nope, If you like add-ons questie is awesome. Shows you where quest are and what to do for them. But you can still.pick your own path.
---
Ah okay
---
Imagine not having the coolest mount in the game.
---
Warlock gang unite!
---
I been playing since launch day with no queues and plenty for dungeons.
---
But I started on a non full servers like they asked me to.
---
What are your specs?
---
How can we grow if we can‚Äôt laugh at ourselves.
---
You can try Atlas Loot. I'm pretty certain it shows the ingredients needed for each recipe. That, along with an add-on like Vendor Price, will tell you how much those items cost at vendors. For AH prices you'd need a different add-on, but I haven't tried one yet.
---
Literally Judas.
---
Except in the spell cleave dungeon meta
---
Yeah I've always needed on blue boes since beta and told others to do the same. Not sure why everyone who does this is getting downvoted to shit as I've had minimal issues with this in game and usually everyone in the group agrees.
---
she restarted pc, reque, tried another realm, and her position is still going higher

Because a lack of literacy is why people use questing addons lol
---
At 44 my I had my first 2g+ repair as a war. Wasn‚Äôt even full break, like 2 reds 3 yellows or something.
---
Silly zealots.
---
Not for weapons. Your abilities are based on the damage of the weapon
---
How dare you disrespect the bulbly boi
---
Don‚Äôt buy anymore weapons from vendors. Same goes for armour. You‚Äôll always find something better from a drop.
---
Was thinking of making a prot paladin which I know is a bad idea if I plan on raiding but generally at 60, I am just looking to do dungeons and grind stuff.
---
I can't find many videos though on classic prot paladin gameplay, my main concern was mana. Because prot paladin tanking can be mana intense, I'm worried about pulling a pack of mobs and having to drink after every pull, is this the case?
---
Any downsides to leveling as Prot?
---
I mean more when there's a high level red in your zone so the only possible way to down him is with a mob, took use 6 22's in STM to down a skull priest who was camping out from sunrock.
---
Only pvp I've seen is duo alliance players level 30+ running around STM and aahenvale. I've maybe had like 6 good 1v1 fights within 3 levels of each other
---
Not for Night Elves
---
I‚Äôm picking my talents loosely off of a guide and what I‚Äôm using mostly drain tanking talents, majority of my talent points are in affliction but it doesn‚Äôt make a huge difference in leveling play around a bit because you will respec at 60
---
The alternative is that there are soo many people that you cant get your quests done on pve servers. At least you get pvp.
---
I'm a rogue and often I'll look inside, take the coins (those get auto-split amongst party) and link the loot in party. Then back out and let people roll if they want it.
---
If he just took all the shit, definitely douche.
---
good old STVietnam &lt;3
---
Idk man, my friend is so obsessed with ninjaing items, that he even has a second set of gear, way worse than his current. When something good drops, he switches to the old gear piece, and is like WOOOW THAT'S INSANE UPGRADE FOR ME.
---
Oh yeah. This guy who ninjad the lockbox was like oh I'm planning on leveling a rogue and need to level his skill. I was like I am a rogue so by that logic I should need..... Either way was bullshit.
---
I don't know how to combat it because I don't want to turn in to one of them. Just hope karma comes back to bite them in the ass.
---
I was at that fight, I wasn't ready for that fight.
---
woah woah woah, picking quests to track for those limited 5 slots is a valuable part of the classic attention-management meta game... or something like that.
---
Yes it does. As long as they follow you before they go AFK they‚Äôll just follow you around with the &lt;AFK&gt; symbol.

Right now probably not. The economy isn‚Äôt going to be stable with most players being low level but once it stabilizes the auctionator addon is pretty helpful in playing the ah
---
Yes, but out of the initial 10.000 possible combos, there are 100 that would be a tie: both roll a 1, both roll 2, both roll 3 and so on.

So the chance to tie is 100/10.000 = 1/100
---
Hunters are the best levelers. I have some good hunters on my friendslist. But most of them are little kids that behave like shit.
---
Why would this be downvoted? You stopped short of making an argument. You simply stated something that is happening, but didn't draw from that to make the argument you alluded to.
---
This would be a dope cave painting, showing ancient pre-engineering gnomes hunting.
---
Yup. He said we wouldn‚Äôt have gotten it without him anyway and if it was that big of a deal in the first place we should just get keys.

Wrong. If he can use it and it's an upgrade, and you can't even equip it, he needs and you greed. End of story.

On Bloodsail Buccaneers I got everything done before bed time.

I think English is obviously not your native language, so therefore we are all not understanding what you're saying.

To us you're saying you got to Rank 2 as your highest. Rank 1 and Rank 2 are not the same as Rank 13 and Rank 14 - which is what I think you meant to say.

That‚Äôs baby boomers, boomers the shortened version, has been repurposed as a meme about very late twenties and thirty year old males that are becoming locked in their ways and starting to emulate their fathers. Their main traits are that they love old games and music and don‚Äôt connect/understand the appeal of newer media. The connection with muscle cars, 80s/90 music cracks me up super hard, getting a beer gut, balding and just shitting on kids it‚Äôs all good stuff. 
---
There was a kind of funny small subreddit until it got spammed by this weird drunk guy who rambled, some politics, and a bunch of angry millennials bitching about the home crisis because they thought meme boomers were baby boomers. 
---
Glad to see it getting a slight resurgence, as it‚Äôs one of the few memes that actually resonates with my aging chunky ass.

Pizza going out! CMON!!!

Imagine going through life and thinking that all jokes are racist. Sorry for you. Also, as a person of a different colored persuasion l, I really don‚Äôt give an ef if some one makes a damn funny joke and it‚Äôs ironically racist.

The final content release for classic wow. After that is when tbc happens.

This is the right answer.

I don‚Äôt care if I‚Äôm 40g short of my mount, that just means I fucked up somewhere in the leveling process.

What‚Äôs the Horde v Alliance ratio right now across all servers?

This is correct. OP needs to see this!

I willingly bought all four of the leather 8 slots...

Technically if you can time it right. Will you? No.

LOL I just read that out loud to my hubby and my Mom's Alexa spoke up and complied! We don't think about her being here because we don't have one, Mom's staying awhile.

I got spit on for having a mount on day 3 I also feel the love

So is my brothers, happy early bday!

The boots aren't that great, they're not bad mind you, but it think they were a +1agi upgrade for me from my random quest reward boots. RFD also has real good shoulders, and an amazing sword from a quest to boot. Like I said, it's not like it's a waste of time to run it, it's just mostly gear for everyone else in there.

People keep saying this but don‚Äôt you have to manually crop the image too? Print screen takes your entire UI.
---
No guide that I know of, do you have a damage meter addon? Then you can gauge how you are relative to your teammates. I use Details.
---
No, the whole point is generating the most gold per hour. With your logic farming boars in Elywnn forest is a viable method of gold farming.
---
I do not think almost everyone agrees on that lol. If that was the case we would have fought for wotlk classic.
---
No way its gots fun quests and really nice green rewards.
---
They always buff me and not the pet. I'd much rather the pet be buffed.

In world of Warcraft the Alliance and Horde is at a truce after the events of Warcraft III so actually not touching the other faction is more according to the lore
---
They way I see it, no one should be doing world pvp right now unless there is a gigantic war going on (like a 50+ man battle). There is no benefit to world pvp, no honor points, it‚Äôs just a waste of time for both parties. Yes, I know I rolled a pvp server, but that‚Äôs because world pvp will actually be fun once phase 2 is out.
---
Same....

Just type kek

Download questie and use it to see on the map where available quests are

yeh. fun thing is i kinda just finished waiting for a 6k que to get in and play for like 30min before having to que up all over again-\_-

I prefer the tongue class.

You get double rest xp if logged out in an inn

If they want to use the upgrade, they can buy it, right?

They can get that upgrade any time they want.

Put some points in blackout when you can, shadow guard with blackout is broken vs melee.
---
Hurry, report it to CNN
---
But is that particular BOE one you are going to keep or one you will soon upgrade when the belt you really want drops from the dungeon you're farming. In my opinion the rogue is thought in most situations. But im not familiar with this piece of kit.
---
Amazon / Netflix can just add a second delay on every request to check if it's from a real user. Hardly noticeable, but blocks the attack. 
---
Harder to implement on a game. 
---
Also, those big companies have a lot of redundant servers to make sure peaks in user acitivity doesn't bring them down. You'd need a much larger botnet to DDOS them than you'd need for wow.
---
Any recommendations for a priest? I've decided to level as holy bc them heals though. Engi/Tailoring for a combination of utility and pvp. I have a farming toon separate.
---
Facts.
---
I found 1k needles to be one of the best at this level. Find a group to get quests in RFK done then focus on STV and 1k Needles as there are a lot of grinding quests in both zones. Completely ignore the retail player above who suggested dungeon spamming. That will ruin classic for you. Just cause it‚Äôs fastest doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs best.
---
I mean how is it ninjaing if everyone in the group rolls needs and its a completely fair roll on who gets the item?
---
They started DDoSing as Asmongold went LIVE. Unbelievable.

Last I heard he's using the same email for his Twitter and his Facebook, so finding him was evidently really simple

I could be convinced.

*cough* 40 somethings as well *cough*
---
not sure why you've been downvoted. It has always been an unspoken rule that you need on anything rare or better if it's BoE
---
There's been a lot of MMORPGs over the years, but not one has managed to make it seem worthwhile to invest my (limited) in it.
---
On top of nostalgia, wow manages to be very compelling early on, while appearing very modest. And it drives you to play with strangers. 
---
I tried playing retail and it felt... Too much. I wish I didn't have to play a 15 years old game to have this feeling, but here it is : exploring this world feels great.
---
Is fishing good for making gold?
---
Best ring for mages, especially frost, and especially PvP.  It‚Äôll sell for way more than 10g, and your mod suggests DEing it. GG.
---
Or assume they were brave enough to learn from their horrendous errors and allow themselves to do it better this time.
---
So people can refer you to other sites.

Which is also easy. Have some pride in your karma farming!

Its the same group of people who want you to pay them 3 gold to run sfk because they are a tank.

Im not here to lose gold running a dungeon you moron. Learn to play the game and make gold on your own time instead of sucking.

I play on Incendius and the server at times feels like 70/30 Horde

I really want to play windfury shaman but I feel like I'll never get the procs and I'll be disappointed

Meant to go back and edit this because of the way it came across. You‚Äôre right; girls don‚Äôt usually get into games. Hell, I don‚Äôt even get into games. Like I said, the last thing I played consistently was DK Country and Super Mario. I said ‚Äúfuck WoW‚Äù the first time I messed with it because I didn‚Äôt know how to move the character and kept getting told to ‚Äúgo this way. Hit that mob. Use your spell.‚Äù A week later, I made my own account and can‚Äôt seem to put it down.
---
Nah, Mograine-Eu

Thats the explanation I was looking for lol
---
Hahahahahahahaha
---
I used one called TotemTimer on private, not sure if it's updated for classic but it's worth a google.
---
The queues are literally the sole reason they decided to use layering. Each layer holds as many people as a whole vanilla server so with 5 layers you'd have 5 times as many active players per server which means you have like 15-20k less people in queue.
---
Also 5x the demand
---
Human trash.

Happy cake day

I tend to stick around but I get this alot it's retail mentality
---
I found ways to earn a living without fishing
---
Yo watch out i heard thats the unofficial pve server for BRs
---
Because you can easily crop context from a conversation and lead to people harassing an innocent person?
---
Gear adds up. 4 or 5 upgrades suddenly means you are pulling an extra 25-30dps per swing, which equates to 100dps per 4 swings. It makes a huge difference over the course of a fight, especially if you get any crits. 
---
If you are that salty about not making gold, then you picked the wrong professions, aren't grinding enough, or need to go back to retail.
---
Wand spec is probably a must for soloing. I'd go down disc until Inner Focus for sure.
---
You‚Äôre kinda boned until you hit 40 and get Shadowform. Then you become a melting machine.
---
Hell ya flare for buffs!
---
I haven't messed with draw resolution at all yet no.
---
Thank you. Cannot stand people thinking skin deep. Like, use your brain for 15 more seconds and you might come to the conclusion that missing a raid on your city 10 days into the game isn't worth literally not being able to play.
---
You are part of the problem.
---
Blizzard had it pretty much right at some point. Have a menu where you list your party as LFM of whatever roles, and a way to list yourself LFG with what roles/dungeons you can do. No auto group nonsense so you still should whisper before invite for the social aspect, and obviously no TP into dungeon when group is formed. Summoning stones should be a thing though, imo.
---
If you look closely it says drawn by  Pyrestudios Age 46
---
Understandable, but if your goal is to level quickly and efficiently it's the best option.
---
That's actually not too bad. I grinded some mobs for a few levels at 36 to get it. Just be cheap and you should be fine.
---
Dude. That's how I feel it's going to happen for me. By level 10 I had already given my alt two bags and given two more away. Then I had two 10 slut bags drop by 25.
---
I'm effed in end game. That or I'll have to grind FOREVER if I want a rare drop.
---
Speed runners usually don't keep their saves, as they are constantly starting over to do another run.
---
The group finder interface is inevitable
---
They didn‚Äôt go for 500-1000 gold in vanilla.  More like 50-90.  
---
They are a rare drop but they aren‚Äôt that rare that anyone who really wants it won‚Äôt spend a day or two farming in the crater for it.
---
Or Live
---
Wanna go ahead and give us your wow names so I can blacklist you now?

Funnily enough, my retail Forsaken warlock is a huge fan of Sylvanas, even though he was raised in another way :p But that's getting a bit off-topic lol.
---
10 slut bags? Oh my
---
It's a terrorist act committed as I said on decent working paying consumers by some shitless cowardly scum that needs to be beaten because mommy and daddy never did. These guys are no different than any other chaos loving criminal scum. I am sick of people putting them on some kind of pedestal like this is the act of a hero or something. These people are fucking scum. They are not hurting anyone but the public with this shit. So what if it's a video game? What in the fuck does that have to do with anything? I know dozens of people many of them disabled who cannot do much more than play video games for fun. What about them you biggoted fuck? This is how they connect with others. It happens to be therapeutic for them. I am not saying that's everyone I am just making the point that it's a little less simple than you seem to be. 
---
Next time think before you type.
---
I love wow classic. Just had a 2 day lan not too long ago non stop questing with the boys

no idea what you are saying here

and you grinded SM for 10 levels missing multiple zones of content. Must have been a fun time lol

They're a chinese guild so of course they play at times that aren't peak for NA

that's the story about wow classic, a lot of young people couldn't play it as they wanted and now they can :)
---
Warlocks killed WoW?
---
Sure, but what's the point of deleting them in the first place? Only reason is hitting 50 toon cap on account.
---
Never heard of or experienced that.
---
Why wouldn‚Äôt you just give it to the MT...
---
Edit: nvm classic isn‚Äôt hard lol why would you prio loot.
---
Doubtful. If I made millions from paying my artists a pittance to make a cat pet, I'm pretty sure I'd be again, annoyed, but not terrified.

As a hunter and new player, definitely didnt know "huntard", but it's pretty funny. 
---
And it's pretty me.
---
So it didnt go to Orcmcorcface?
---
Wanding is 50% of your damage while leveling, keeping your wand up to date as you level is crucial. 
---
Think of it like a dot, it's similar to getting new ranks of sw:pain, every time you upgrade a wand your dot ( wand damage) increases.
---
Well in that case, we should give this power back to the GMs, because apparently we‚Äôre not interested in policing ourselves.
---
Where the hell are these people getting all their gold? I‚Äôve encountered many kind strangers, but 18g is a lot, even if you have over 100. I don‚Äôt wanna be cynical but this reeks of bs

Lol!

launch any other game with 3rd person view

I've been questioning a lot of the old information based on private servers to classic. I've made a different priest leveling spec that focuses on keeping the target far away and ideal never reaching you by getting a stun. [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/05023013--5502502103501251](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/05023013--5502502103501251)
---
Rotation would be Life Tap&gt;Mind Blast&gt;Shadow Word Pain&gt;Mind Flay&gt;Mind Blast&gt;Wand Ideally you would get a stun  and the target wouldn't get to you at all. You could apply shield in dire situations or when the target finally gets to you.
---
Dire Maul always has a suffix like DM:E since there are several instances. The VC side are 99% trolls

EZ Junk

I was in Goldshire yesterday as Horde and a surprising amount of lvl &lt;10 alliance attacked me.
---
Get a good wand, dot 2-3 targets and just use bubble and HoT. You dont need to pull 1 by 1.
---
Just make your own group or ask to join any group tbh. Not a big deal.
---
Isn't it that Grell drop the moss but Grellkin drop the shrooms?
---
You aren't allowed to use anything like a title (king, queen, etc).  The error is just a generic error they use when the name isn't valid.
---
Also, use print screen.
---
They're on a desktop playing WoW.. Just always seemed more convenient to take a screenshot, tab out, and then upload it to Reddit.
---
In retail there are no mob tags, you can just hit other people mobs and get credit too
---
Also same... rip.
---
True, the color tricked me hahaha
---
How much does it cost to respec now for the first time?
---
Horde one shoulda been called Blightclaw.
---
Just ran WC with a hunter, two warlocks, rogue, and shaman.
---
Was easiest I've done so far lmao.
---
Yep. Safest way to do it is to figure it out with your group BEFORE the item drops.
---
&gt; thought it would be a funny name
---
Black people aren‚Äôt a punchline dude.
---
The world (the west, anyway) was way, WAY less racist 15 years ago even though ‚Äúcasual racism‚Äù was a normal thing in jokes. How does that work? Twisting meanings to get offended doesn‚Äôt mean what was said was actually meant derogatorily/seriously. Taking offense (especially taking offense of behalf of others) to the most mundane shit has set back social relations by decades.
---
HUMUNGOUS WOT!? Yeah, it sounds that ridiculous when people ‚Äúcall out‚Äù obvious jokes. Despite all the crap people say about there being 50 billion racists in the world, being ACTUALLY bigoted (seriously talking shit about a group of people) isn‚Äôt tolerated at all by like anyone anymore, unless it‚Äôs dehumanizing people in the other side of politics.. that‚Äôs really gucci right now.
---
It's pretty simple. The basic idea is that the best use for a lower level blue BoE is to sell it. That the gold will help you level more than the increased stats over whatever green item it might replace. 
---
So once you believe that equipping the item is a poor choice for anyone then obviously you aren't going to see the benefits in passing on your chance for the best use of the item just because someone else wants to waste the opportunity. 
---
Obviously you don't have to agree but it's not hard to understand. The fact that there are other ways to make gold is irrelevant. Players will by necessity be doing those things anyways. Selling the BoE means they will have to spend less time doing them. So you'll level quicker. THAT'S why some people are saying the Need Before Greed custom doesn't make sense in this situation.
---
To get to Crossroads from Razor Hill head west until you cross over a river/bridge. Once in barrens, keep heading west until you get to a north south road and turn south, shouldn‚Äôt be that far south. The Crossroads isn‚Äôt huge but has a lot of quests.
---
Why did you blur that asshat‚Äôs name? Should have said server and name so that people could avoid him.
---
If they let me loot it I'll help them bug test it.
---
I ude the Luna unit frame addon, it has this feature avaliable for all the frames you want it on. Super useful for healing and knowing how much health you'll heal
---
&gt; You will quite often run out of quests well before you're high enough level to move on to the next zone, so at some point in the future get used to the idea of just mindlessly grinding mobs for hours.
---
This was correct at launch in vanilla, let's say patch 1.1- 1.6   But later they added tons of quests and by 1.12  (Classic) this is not a problem anymore.   You can skip whole zones and still have enough quests.
---
Everything is a time waste honestly. If people want to delete their characters, go for it. They can restore it anyway if they have second thoughts about it later.

I have an add-on that disables the noise and visuals of being dead. I never hear this.

This shit didn't even bother me. I was just like "ok I'll take the dog out and vacuum, oh look the servers are back up." Kid(s) is dumb as fuck.

That would be funny

I just mean how some people have never used Reddit on their desktop AT ALL. I always browse on my phone, and maybe have had Reddit up on my computer 3 times. I know they‚Äôre playing WoW. But they already have Reddit up on their phone, like always, compared to never having opened it on their computer.
---
The charms are not soul bound so you can value them to get a fair comparison. On my server it was 12g for 8 of each charm total, so if you are lvl 43 it'd be cheaper to buy the BOE. Then keep in mind the time to farm bloodscalps.

About 20 goblins or 1 tauren.

Short explanation of the dual issues surrounding this coffer (Its the one right next to the heart of the mountain, in the secret compartment).
---
-When looting the coffer, a blue item will be inside of it, but a loot roll notification will not be sent. This item will go directly into the looter's bags if he/she is not careful.
---
-However, even if he/she *is* careful, and announces to the party that item A dropped which would be good for someone other than the person who opened said chest, the chest (and the item) will despawn when they click off of it. A second person will not have the opportunity to loot the chest, and the item will be gone.
---
Just as an aside, the loot table of the coffer seems to be that of the 7D encounter. **As such my static group(s) agreed that if there is a healer who needs the 7D hammer, to be on the safe side they always get to loot the coffer, as that is (in our opinion) the best item in said chest and not worth wasting on a non-healer. After they had their hammer, we simply /roll between those who have a desirable item from 7D and may the odds be ever in their favor.**

Cheers geez, I'm gonna make another one this week :)

Idk, people think in different ways. The character is no longer going to be used, so they think they should delete. If they're moving servers, maybe someone will want the name they had. Multiple reasons why they'd delete.

You realize the games been out almost 2 weeks... and he's still there... so I guess he's not going back to retail after a week

Hey mate fellow warrior, i just started running dungeons for the first time the other day and let me tell you it's much faster leveling and loot than questing. Keep at it!

Nah I rather just used my little brothers drawing for karma .

I certainly seemed to feel a paradigm shift in their design philosophy when they added LFG. I distinctly remember falling asleep while tanking the Nexus and when I woke up I was the only person left in the group and seeing in the chat history that they just cleared the rest of the dungeon without me.
---
I'll post later

I remember watching this on Attack of the show back in the day and still remember this!

You clearly don‚Äôt understand a DDoS attack if you‚Äôre saying they don‚Äôt have their shit together. There‚Äôs no real way to defend against them, you can only overpower them.
---
**There is this really useful keyboard button called PRINT SCREEN.**
---
It's not supposed to be a one button macro. It's a macro with the goal to save action bar space. Instead of putting all four of those spells on four different slots on your action bars, you just put that one macro on one slot and you're (almost) done. In this situation you'll also have to unbind some default keybinds, such as Shift 1 (default for switching to action bar 1) and Ctrl 1 (default for pet attack I believe).

This is why if something drops and a dude says this, just swap to master loot and fucking take it. GG motherfucker.

How does it grab the AH price? Like is that what is sold at last or somthing?
---
I loved BC, but it introduced the game mechanics that would eventually turn wow into a shit game.
---
\- Flying. Once you're in the air, you're safe, and nowhere should be safe in wow.
---
\- Multiple difficulties. Recycling content and calling it new is an insult.
---
\- Dailies. Enough said.
---
\- Exponential stat growth. As soon as HP greens were better than vanilla raid epics, they set the stage for their eventual stat squishes.
---
Again, I played the crap out of BC and if they opened up a BC server I'd play on it. But the best thing we can hope for classic in the future is new content where the developers learn from all the mistakes of the past, and decide not to repeat them.

The way transmogs work now isn't so simple. That belt you want from dungeon X now shares a model with a trash drop from green mob y. That's why there is an AH market for transmogs. It also means people go back and clear easy content for a set look instead of proudly wearing current gear.

That's the worst troll I've seen in a long time.

Nice, this happens once in a leveling lifetime

your not wrong 99% of the time it ends up on the AH. I dont think ive ever actually seen a group member win a boe and equip it on the spot. im sure it happens ive just never seen it

I don't believe there's another option besides not training the rank you want to avoid.

I raid with my guild like 4 hours a week and occassionally do a dungeon when someone asks me to. Most of the busy work content outside of those things makes me hate myself for doing it.

My fellow hunter, this is what you need. 
---
https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/
---
And yes when you tame a pet from the list that has an ability THAT pet has it automatically, but if you want to add it to your training tab and teach it to a stabled pet, you need to use the ability in combat until you learn it. It will say something like, you have learned bite in yellow. Then double check the training tab. You can then abandon that pet, get back your stabled pet and teach it to them.
---
Gotta respect the hustle. Even online.
---
Yeah, what's wrong with aoe farming?  If you're abusing layers, ok, I get it.
---
But if I'm not and I'm just leveling up, what am I doing wrong?

 But where should the gold come from? There isn't enough to pay that high prices everyone expects. So everyone is BOE hoarding for the next months and sells it later when enough gold is around.
---
I can understand this but i don't like it.

Shit like this is why Hillsbrad is my favorite zone
---
Absolutely this, people who disagree/say otherwise are simply retarded. 
---
If it's a random shit BOE that sells for like 5g on the AH then you let the person who can wear it have it in the event that it's an upgrade. If an incredibly expensive item drops like the Staff of Jordan or Skull Flame shield then you need the fuck out of it as 99% of the time the person who's pretending that they're going to wear it will be putting it on the AH so that they can buy their epic mount as well.
---
Awesome, thanks!

Nope, and that also isn't my only source. Come on, I'm glad you're taking your job seriously and I'm sorry if it seemed like I was attacking you personally, but I feel like it's hard to argue that teaching is one of the most time-demanding jobs out there. I know the pros/cons of my job and how many of my colleagues behave within these boundaries, sometimes a little introspection goes a long way.

Find a guild. Make friends. Socialize.  Dont expect a realm that just opened to have players that have leveled to dungeon content yet. Start a character on a higher pop server.  This is your problem not the games.

As a druid, mages is the easiest class. If they run with frost armor on, I just stay in travel form and they don't outrun me. If they freeze me, I powershift. If they blink, bear form + feral charge (which has same cooldown as their blink). Even when they outlevel me, they absolutely never fight back. And I'm immune to their polymorph so they can never get at a distance. There is something that makes a mage only want to cast at you if they are at a distance. So even high level mages are easy.
---

---
I think in principle, needing BoEs should be standard.
---
First, it eliminates ninjas. Second, it's ultimately fair. Third, the winner of the roll can always decide to give to the person who can equip it.
---
If a twink BoE item drops, why would you force someone to wear it when they might want to sell it later down the line.
---
The idea that BoEs need to be immediately equipped is silly.
---
BoEs are interchangeable with gold, which everyone needs. You could make a case for bis BoEs, though

Funny that people don't realize this, quests are just a way of tricking you into grinding because our fragile little western brains need to feel like they have a bigger purpose when performing repetitive tasks.

I would recommend nabbing The Crescent Staff asap! Complete the quest chain from Tonga runetotem in XR and finish the Wailing Caverns for a weapon you wont replace for a while.

Lmao, I have so many questions. Why would a pub despise me for liking sparkling water? Sparkling water is more popular in European countries than in NA. Why would I care if they knew what it was?
---
You're entitled to BoP's, not BoE's. I dont understand why that's hard to understand. You want an item you'll replace in 5 levels? I want 40g. Get over it.
---
No I prefer to consider the complete lack of education and laziness of the English language. If you want to take it down a path of potential ESL speakers that‚Äôs on you
---
I still enjoy it.  Classic is a big draw to me right now but I rather enjoy retail. I say give it a go!
---
Until lvl 25 strenght is equal to agi, but once you are more leveled agility is way better for crits and also adds some dodge, so thats nice.
---
I'd like to add onto this: She could be sipping one of these through a *straw* so as not to fuck up her lipstick and *still* be more masculine than you.

I remember buying gold once. It might have been connected to getting myself the epic mount back in the day. The fun part was grinding the gold and leaving to 40 and but the mount. The epic one was just something I needed but did not have the same thrill. I can‚Äôt remember how much it costed. But I do remember being contacted by a low level in ironforge for the ‚Äútransfer‚Äù hehe. And ofc....not a single written word about gold selling was mentioned from any of us;)
---
So because you have trust issues we should fuck over the whole system? Thats just brilliant. And what happens when I'm a mage at level 35 and Staff of Jordan drops? If you need it to use it you click need, otherwise greed, its not that hard. And if you get ninjaed by somebody else you do whatever you can to destroy that persons reputation on the server and you make sure he is never able to group up again.
---
Same here.  Could it be a d-dos attack?
---
Its not counterproductive, its just as productive as going solo. Twice as many kills means twice as many drops.
---
The real reason why dungeon leveling or just straight farming is so much faster is because there is such an immense amount of people at all the questing areas. If you enter an area that has 2-3 quests in it, there will literally be 20-30 people competing over tags.
---
But no, grouping for drop quests does not matter in the slightest
---
It was an awesome and pleasant surprise when I got home from work that morning. Tons of fun, thanks for the raid, was a beautiful mad house.

ClassicCastBar
---
I had no idea you could bind raid target icons like that.
---
Is there a way to make a mouse over macro for those as well?
---
Hmm, interesting. So far I only needed to learn Bite 1 and skipped rank 2, but both for Bite and Claw the listed mobs had the abilities.
---
Have you checked in the spellbook as well, maybe it's just the action bar that's missing?
---
Alternatively, check out [Petopia's list.](https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/abilities.php#bite) If you tamed a Ghostpaw Alpha following the advice of the spreadsheet, petopia lists that mob for level 27-28. At level 24 you've got Giant Moss Creeper (24-25, Hillsbrad), Leech Widow (24, Wetlands), or Black Ravager (24-25, Duskwood).

The biggest difference between retail after I believe Cata and vanilla is what's known as the "five second rule". For five seconds after you cast your last spell, your mana regen will drop to zero. At five seconds, and then every two seconds thereafter your mana starts regenerating. In retail, your mana constantly regenerates, though at a slower rate in combat vs out of combat. 
---
The best way to take advantage of this is to be more "bursty" with your heals. Take your druid for instance. Throw some rejuvs on some lightly damaged folks. Wait for your mana to regen a bit. Throw out some healing touches and regrowths. Wait for your mana to regen a bit.
---
If you constantly are casting, you'll never break out of that 5 second window, and will never regen any mana. Note, there are talents, stats, cooldowns, etc. that change that, but for the most part, stick to compensating for five seconds.
---
how do I make potions ?
---
My brother and friends are logged on so doubt it
---
The /s is a hint....
---
First time I saw it was Ooga gang using it during the beta.  Someone posted a pic the other day of Asmongold getting killed and the horde player saying "no hair" and I thought that was pretty funny too.
---
You can't dye gear on retail, for that you need either SWTOR or GW2.
---
Gotta make that hustle. I just spend 20 gold leveling tailoring last night, still had 20 left over at 35. Made it all back before I logged. I don't understand how people hit 40 and can't afford their mounts.
---
They aren‚Äôt worth any fee. Get the free ones if you want to level fast. Do note that you might not have enough gold for your mounts at the appropriate level.
---
Except you can't dye in retail at all. They even explained at Blizzcon why this can't be a thing.
---
No idea. 
---
I‚Äôm in what is supposed to be some hardcore PvP guild but gchat is often full of people complaining about being ganked or asking for a layer invite to avoid ally.
---
where do you get that information at
---
Ungebildeter Amerikaner.  Sie sind von Ihrem schrecklichen Bildungssystem verschuldet und trinken beschissenes Bier.
---
Typical horde scum. This is why you are hunted like the beasts you are.
---
Tried that last night and it wasn't working
---
See you in jail :p
---
That's also available with the default UI. I've got my guild, world and lfg all in seperate tabs
---
I love doing this on my lock. I'll have my voidwalker taunt and then trade a healthstone if I see someone losing a fight. If they are going die before my walker kills them I'll fear.
---
Lol okie enjoy slow questing because you can't tag mobs
---
I was there as well.  Saved a couple people with my big-dick pally heals.  Tons of fun.
---
It can be more efficient to duo for drop quests if you're playing a slower class or if the drops are in tightly clustered areas. Two people can kill things easier as well as keep each other alive faster than 1 person can solo it. 
---
3 or more is asking for a bad time though
---
People like you are why you have these trust issues.
---
You know, retail has plenty of questing space. You should check it out, I heard it's amazing.
---
My friend uses 1, I use the other. I think this is a must, keeps you from tabbing out to look up quests all the time
---
Im running it off a usb 3 hard drive lol. The latency makes it rough but better than watching the matrix for the 11th time lol
---
Even censored the eyes on the poor cow lmao
---
Yeah. Dick size doesn't matter. People's attitudes matter.
---
I‚Äôm looking for a laptop that can run classic on normal settings in the $500 range. I travel for work quite a bit and would like something small that I could use on an airplane. I definitely don‚Äôt need to run on max graphics settings. Just something that can smoothly run the game. Any suggestions would be appreciated!
---
I like the layers in leveling zones. I do not think the layering should be intense at all in cities, though, and less layers on areas with world-pvp. Seems like it would just be nice to have the ability to run into an area because someone's talking about the battle and getting to participate instead of frantically finding a group on the right layer. But, for leveling? I wouldn't be out of the starting zones without it.
---
I had the same problem, but I managed to queue again. Might be DDOS again?
---
You don't understand that customs exist for a reason. In this case the custom is based on the fact that most good loot is BoP. What people are pointing out is that this custom doesn't work well in this situation because no one needs blue BoEs. Since the best use for the item is to sell it it doesn't make sense to ask people to pass so someone else can waste it by equipping it.
---
Rofl, this is so funny.
---
The most redeeming thing is knowing that the majority of these copycat Ddos attackers will live in a cesspool like Russia throughout their entire lives.
---
Its not seeking it out lol. Its blatent.
---
The rick and Morty purge episode was exactly this. The rich ruling class pits the poor people against each other as they live in luxury
---
And onto the shitlist that name goes.
---
&gt;*iirc vanilla rolling etiquette for BoE's was that it was supposed to be everyone greed*
---
IIRC it's up to you and the people you're grouping with to decide what to do with drops...
---
 You‚Äôve got to be fucking with me. There‚Äôs no way you are sincerely unable to get this incredibly simple concept. 
---
Chapelle works because his material is *funny*. You can be offensive all day long and so long as it‚Äôs in the context of *actual jokes* you‚Äôre golden. Conversely, however, *merely using offensive language* isn‚Äôt in and of itself funny. It‚Äôs fucking insulting to compare Chapelle‚Äôs comedy to the low effort trash example that spawned this thread. 
---
Morons should avoid racially charged humor because you need actual talent to pull it off. Otherwise you‚Äôll just piss people off and come across as an imbecile.

Why are you upvoted?  You're wrong.
---
It was a meeting stone to add you in a dungeon group queue.  Then it was a summoning stone.
---
Thats why you let him equip it after he won to make sure that doesn't happen. Let people have their luck and upgrade where possible, don't poison the well by allowing ninjaing to happen.
---
Needs more fart jokes
---
Arms is easier. You still switch to a sheild and sword for dungeons but use the 2h to level faster. Prot isnt necessary until 20man raids. You are making your life harder and slower by trying to level sword and board. But do what you enjoy!
---
There's not much a difference tbh you should be doing what works for you best when leveling not what the "meta" is. Funny how many mage I see dying to aoe pulls b.c world first mage did it from aoe grinding. Also lvl 27 it will be to populated to get any real aoe grinding done most the time.
---
If aoe isn't working then yeah try a ST spec.
---
Here's the best ST spec:

Ssussssles. What I genius idea for a name.

You wanna go down the afflic talent tree picking up reduction to spell pushback etc then finish off in the demo talent tree. Try to accumulate as much shadow damage gear as possible. You‚Äôll open like this 
---
Immolate‚Äî&gt;agony‚Äî&gt;corruption‚Äî&gt; drain life
---
You are still leveling so all quests are worth picking up.

in blizzard app, on the wow page there's a scolldown menu and select wow classic. Short download, under 5gb I think
---
Some solid ideas, thank you!
---
I cant get over how much of a sandbox this game feels like even though it isnt. My biggest problem is logging in and figuring what am I going to do today. Maybe explore into a new zone? Or focus on finding ore deposits? Or finding out if and how to train guns on my warrior?
---
So many options with no hand holding makes it feel refreshing each time I log on, even though the game is over a decade in age.
---
My guild constantly does posture and water checks. Guano gang.
---
tbh i dont really participate in wpvp much unless it appears in front of me then its only just the one time kill and i move on. i dont know why they held off on the honor system.
---
Time to remake your character. Your paladin must now buff all of those who pass through the gates of Stormwind.
---
That's what questing is mate...
---
Black Desert Online is the game for you my friend.
---
So last night I worked on getting my Succubus while my wife quested in Ashenvale. Id say for about 3 hours straight Horde camped her and wouldnt let her do shit. I told her to leave Ashenvale and go quest somewhere else. But she is under the impression that this is the ONLY place to level for her level (22). I told her to go to Stontalon Mount but she said its going to be just as Horde infested over there. So then I told her to go do Darkshore, but she said she already did all the quests over there. Any advice? Everyone in the general chat just last night seemed just as upset as her or said "lol roll on a pve server pussy" or some shit.
---
I won't stop you or anyone else from rolling need on whatever you want, but what I'm saying is that you have to have ground to stand on if you complain about someone 'ninja-ing' your loot. 
---
A hunter complaining that he's not getting a melee damage upgrade ( something that hunters rarely ever use), a weapon that gives him no beneficial stats besides a few stamina, and equipping something that will easily be replaced quickly just by questing is not a sufficient enough reason to whine about 'getting your loot stolen'. "Hunter weapon btw"
---
What im trying to argue is that being 'allowed' to need BOEs is relative, and whoever decides that is in your group. You have to weigh how much of an upgrade it is verses how much it could sell for and by effect be an upgrade for the buyer.
---
My warrior looks like a mage :|

Sure maybe literally right now you aren't getting super great prices for boes, but in general the idea works.

It's not about logic or fun it's about aging neckbeards that are afraid of changing anything from their very flawed idea of vanilla.  Its the same reason they lost their mind over an lfg addon that existed in vanilla and still exists now
---
I actually find grinding mobs super relaxing this time around and the added mystery of a random

drop adds to the fun.

I‚Äôve been joining random players on kill quests I‚Äôve completed just for fun

I did not know that! That's hilarious xD

Yes officer, this comment right here.
---
Its world wide isn't it?
---
You really think they care if you make a post or not lol? They know they are pissing people off either way easy load up twitch.
---
Allyroute is an addon I use (horse variants ofc). Made by speed runners, currently 2 days 5 hours into the game sitting at level 34. Tells you what quests to leave, which to take, and at the most efficient rate. Worth for anyone who needs direction for leveling.
---
Maybe you're not a friend to them.
---
Meme getting old tho right? Queues aren‚Äôt really long even if you get them anymore and it‚Äôs only during peak play time
---
I've checked couple of videos and everywhere I clearly hear "as" instead of "us" at the end. Might be because I am not native english speaker tho. Thanks for satisfying my curiosity. :)
---
Someone should tell them that what they're really looking for are mages.
---
Horde can melee cleave a bit in SM only, but generally the only groups with a truly high ceiling on xp/hour are the ones with all mages.
---
Yeah it's dead, Jim.

and yet you decided to pursue the action that takes more physical work...

It should be in classic, regardless if it wasn't or not.

The exact same function was achieved back then simply by disconnecting. Why not give users a less janky alternative? They're going to do it anyways and it's completely harmless.

Hello all.  I used to play when original WoW was released, up until cata.  Then I had some kids, pc never got upgraded, and I have been playing xbox. (Overwatch)  my husband built me a new gaming pc for my birthday because I am dying to play classic wow!

My Absolute favorite thing was warsong gulch.  I remember making level 29 Twinks and traveling to the night elf area to stand in queue.  We had a whole group on my old server.  (sargeras)  I remember CRYING and being absolutely devastated when my best friend in the game accidentally shot something someone else was killing and leveled to 30!  
---
My question is what are the brackets like for wsg?  There isn‚Äôt a 10-19 yet is there?  What about AB? What about AV? Are the low level bgs poppin?  What is the most active pvp server?

Yeah it crashed again thanks to the dickhead from yesterday's DDOS attack. I'm expecting them to do more maintenance between now and regular Tuesday.
---
Is that the headpiece from Gnomeregan? If so, does the use effect work for you?
---
I got it, but can't get it to deal damage, though the shield work
---
Ok fair enough. Was a bit concerned because this is the first time I download and try to launch. So figured it wasn‚Äôt related to the DDoS events but rather my computer not being compatible.
---
You are likely not going to be doing dungeons 100% of the time. If you go fury you will have better dps for faster dungeon clears and also better solo questing. You shouldn't have an issue with threat since you are doing great dps and survivability is fine most of the time. Just don't try and tank six mobs at once. Most warriors don't level in prot full time.
---
Do as you like, you can also try another class, there is a lot the enjoy outthere

It grants you elite status

I'm new to wow and i doubt after few months when there will be i guess a lot of high levels doing raids and whatnot to remember some random guy, probably 1 of the raid might remember him and call him out, but will they really kick him just cuz another random guy says so?

It's part of the deal really

30 Priest and just got my first +healing item. (Staff of the Blessed Seer) Should I automatically just equip it when I'm healing dungeons, or should I be equipping something that gives much more intellect?
---
I just remembered 15 years ago having 10 "bid" points, and the leader set to master loot. it was a mini dkp system, our server (eredar) just kind of knew that was the way. so if you didn't need anything but gold, you bid one point on every drop, if you needed something, you saved all 10 hopeing for it. memories
---
And this is why I honestly prefer personal loot and wouldn't mind seeing it in pugs even in classic.
---
Valid

reddit hive. First comment was wrong but set the trend. Always the way.
---
Use a single 2 handed weapon. 
---
Your DPS for any given gear load out is located in the Character screen. If you haven't bound the 'C' key to anything, press it and locate the damage output numbers on the lower right. Notice as you equip various weapons, the total DPS changes.

Do it. I leveled Arms in Vanilla and it was fine. People make it sound worse than it is.
---
Wow, I played and raided in classic, we blacklisted people like you from our raids ALL the time.
---
I don't think it includes trainers, but it does include anything you buy from a vendor like trade goods/food/water/etc
---
Why don't they just group?
---
One thing that might not be mentioned is that you will take aggro more easily if you are close to the enemy. If you're already standing at range every pull then ignore this, but if you've ever been standing in melee range of the enemy it is likely making a difference.
---
Thought it said you ‚Äúnailed‚Äù your sister , which is also cool.

I'm not sure what sort of delusion you're under that all the assholes are just "retail tourists."

Sounds like an exaggeration which is something I do. Exaggeration for emphasis. So go fuck your self you sound fun at parties.

It wasn't in vanilla. I reported it as a bug during beta, but I guess they decided to leave it in. Meh. Not a huge deal.

Total numbers doesn't equal more fans. Just because you continued playing in bc and wotlk you can still think it got worse
---
You'll need to find a higher level WindSerpent that already knows Rank 3. Once your Hunter learns it, you can teach it to any other WindSerpent.
---
This happens far too much to me
---
Awesome! Thanks for the recommendations
---
Yes why do you think he is doing it jesus you people don't think much do ya. It does nothing if no one cares. But all you come here crying gives them satisfaction of a job well done rather than a waste of time.

Who cares hes a fucking hunter they use bows/guns as their main weapon.
---
Lol he deleted this thread too. 
---
L M A O
---
holy shit i had a fun time getting humar too i'd reccomend naming him after a player you want to remember.
---
i ended up staying up till 4 am with a night elf hunter playing peggle only to have it spawn an hour after i called it quits the next day there were two chinese night elf hunters who threatened to kill it if i tamed it and tried to bribe me with a discount on wow gold to leave.
---
it all came to a climax when it spawned and just then i was ganked by a hordie and i had to inv my other dwarf hunter friend to kill her just in the nick of time before she tamed. i just barely  missed taming the first time and she respawned so i said "kill it" referring to the hordie and he thinking i was referring to the pet decided to tame it instead. thing is it turns out when he died taming he still got the pet and he didnt respawn we both got the pet without even switching layers all the while fending off horde and hoping they dont call for higher levels.
---
in the end i name him after the dwarf hunter who helped me tame and he named his after me probably the most satisfying feeling in this game.
---
Thanks, I finally found a good guide:

---
just ask for invites 5-6 times per zone and people will inv, people love group play, the XP is split, but you get more xp and you kill faster
---
(allot of times the first group might accept you)

I mean, I was dual pulling with my lock the moment I got a pet...

I think you are just a little biased to warriors. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Bigglesworth is a high pop PvP PST server. Only has small queues during high peak hours, 10 min wait is the longest I have had all week.
---
LOL all he had to do is look at twitch who the fuck cares if someone posts on here about it.  You are so uneducated.
---
2Handers are considered better, but you can manage both. Dual wield struggles because of the minus hit on main hand and massive minus hit on offhand. 1H and shield is not focus on damage.  
---
slow 2Handers are better because most damaging attacks are based off weapon damage, so slower the weapon, heavier it hits.  
---
Also, heroic strike is not that good, only use when having lot of rage. that doesnt happens a lot on lower levels.  
---
You will die a lot, so group up when you can
---
hope this helps
---
You alright there, bucko?
---
I assume that's the Druid skill description? Pet growl is not a taunt, just a threat generator.
---
Yeah.  Questing in Hillsbrad yesterday, almost every instance of PvP I participated in or saw was between Allies in their 30s against Horde in their 20s.  Couple times I saw Horde around 30 take out an Ally on a mount.  Only saw one instance of a Horde player ganking someone several levels lower.

When we won the fights I joined in on, everyone would just move on.  When we lost, the victors would hang around spamming /spit like the classy gentlemen they are.

Dude I‚Äôm not saying they don‚Äôt have the capability, I‚Äôm saying their instinct is to do it on their phone since they are more use to it. Why be so sarcastic acting like people are stupid?

Join the various chat channels. /world /LookingForGroup /LFG /ClassicLFG. Create a new chat tab set to just track those.

Also download the ClassicLFG addon. It‚Äôll scan various chat channels for LFG keywords and organize it into a UI, better facilitating group finding.
---
I resemble that remark
---
The proof is that people did Ony and Rag, in greens, with levels 50s in their party, less than 2 weeks after release. That's ridiculous and honestly defeats the purpose of 'End Game' content. 
---
There have been multiple posts about it, including this one from a simple Google search:

---
Honestly it defeats the entire purpose of Classic. It used to be fun having to slowly get better gear and progress through a raid week by week as a guild. But if we can do these raids before even hitting level 60...what then? Literally what do you do then if the *end game* raids aren't even challenging in green gear??
---
Because it's mildly obnoxious to see people taking out their phones to take a picture of their computer screen, then having to transfer it to their computer and post it, when you could instead just press 1 button and have a screenshot taken.

And these posts keep popping up literally every day.

Tigerstrike Mantle dropped when I was randomly questing and EVERYONE needed on it (full party) including those who didn't need it. I (rogue) was lucky enough to win it but was shocked by all the need rolls, the mage said that's how how you handle world drops like that... no... no it's not.

Flavored TV Static
---
A priest i was questing with was targeting the quest mobs abnormally fast with skulls. Now I know how it's done, thanks!
---
Ain't no retailer who never played the level grind going to hit 60 in 2 days
---
The 'idea' is to encourage grouping. It's a good idea, until the quest requires drops that aren't shared. Or until you go to an area with 3 full 5 party groups and you have 0 chances of tagging any mobs. 
---
You can either change questing area, grind mobs semi-locally for a bit (probably faster exp anyway) or catch up on your professions if you haven't already. Or look for a dungeon group. In my experience, being stubborn doesn't tend to work out well and I find that it's much more fruitful to do something else with my time.
---
Rogue if you want to be a solo class warrior if you have a group. But warrior only goes DW with gear around level 60, you‚Äôll be leveling as 2h until then.
---
Ahh yeah Single target priest is really slow at killing :(
---
Playing priest too so feel yha.
---
Just do it haha. The only thing is be mindful of your pulls and respawns. If you need help just group. It‚Äôs really not that bad.
---
How is your post different than looking up the game on twitch?
---
Ideally a community that was OK to help out with the more challenging quests/dungeons and was ok with the occasional question. I try to Google most things but there are is so much online about WoW. I'm a good team player and just want to find a solid group of people to play with on the regular.
---
If you are nolifing it isnt important. But if you have responsibilities and you cant play all the time then it will help you a lot.
---
Can't understand people playing gnome..
---
What are you talking about?
---
No thats not how it works... 
---
You can get to rank 10 or 11 by just pvping alot in your playtime. 
---
But the ranks 13 and 14 are insane there can only be 1 lvl 14 a week per faction on a server so that means you have to grind more then all other players. 
---
I have nolifed vanilla pvp in a premade group farming honor in bgs. We lost maybe 1 game per 15 or so. 
---
Everyweek one of us got to rank 14 burned out and fell away. 
---
But this means your not only competing vs the oposing team but your competing with how much play time you have vs the others in your premade.
---
lol damn, not sure why I remember seeing 40 when I went to a vendor, but that makes sense. I'll get that too though, if it means being level 39 flipping on the AH or gathering forever. No point continuing the game without a mount in my eyes.
---
Just so you know, even if a country doesn‚Äôt have an extradition treaty with the US they will still do it for something in return. But if you are in a country that extradites you may as well kiss your freedom goodbye for a while. 
---
Assuming you are posing as the guy who bought a DDoS attack.
---
Questing is basically mob grinding with a reward every 30-40 kills.
---
Are there any factions that i should consider getting rep for while levelling to 60?
---
Ssussssles
---
Completely agree. I started to lose interest in the game as soon as cross faction and LFG became a thing.
---
Especially the cross faction. Half the fun was that you knew* players and guilds from your server. On both sides. It really felt like you're own little world and you were a part of it. 
---
With cross faction it took all of that away. Made it feel so impersonal. I hated it
---
BJ
---
It's only really BiS at 60, because those 3 uses get used up and then you don't have any more of the weapon. I guess you could chain Gnomer backdoor runs for days and stock up to have them for leveling, but I think that'd be a waste of time.

Leveling Warrior - how good is Sword n Board?

Am asking because i take a lot more damage than i'd like with 2h and i have to eat every other mob.

Shield block seems to reduce damage taken drastically but im not sure it's worth it as i spend more time on killing the mob.

Also another question - should i use Sunder Armor or HC with 2 as low level Rage dump?

That‚Äôs fair, I‚Äôm just saying for me personally the color gradient visual effect helps me a lot.

You're wrong. There is 1 in BB and the other in darkshire for ally.

Do you not understand the difference between greed and need? They put the greed button there for a reason. To sell. don‚Äôt be a the douche that everyone in this game hates.

The Druid tank level 17 is the problem. What level is Verdan? 22? He hits like a truck already on appropriately leveled tanks - and you can expect to consistently spam your highest beak on the tank on that fight (and likely go oom) and have a death or two. It‚Äôs just scaled weirdly and always has been
---
This is correct. Everyone should need on BoE blues and purples.
---
So then why have a Greed option for rolling anyway?  It‚Äôs called Need *Before* Greed.  
---
Why does the mechanic exist?  Would there be any instance in which you as a player would select Greed?  Or are your only two choices, pass and Need??

The gold prices are dropping insanely fast, went from 32$ per gold down to 1$ in less than two weeks on the biggest EU servers. Probably way more supply than demand at these prices.

Using the quest reward from DM. Cloth, Mail, Shields, 2-handers. Those are the only quest rewards. I'm using level 15-20 gear at 36.
---
I didn't. Several people including myself were farming them and I think he just pushed himself too hard in getting the tags.
---
Pretty much what I thought thanks
---
Yeah, how'd you get that?
---
That's great until people don't equip, or roll need last and ninja it. Just roll need you idiots, if you are so nice you can trade it over to the person you think is going to equip it but don't be surprised when its on the AH later.
---
Not sure about the kinds, I think so!

no, she is 6,3k now

I'm probably gonna reassess around 30 but I wanna try holy for leveling even if I end up dungeon spamming
---
It's okay for Warrior but it's still literally your 4th best stat. I checked and level 38-42 green belts have 20 stats while this belt has 22. If you really want to you can get of the wolf or of the boar but I guarantee most people will be getting of the bear, tiger, or monkey anyway. Either way I checked AH and the belts at level 40 are going to cost you a solid 20s after vendor price when you replace it so it's in your best interest to make an easy 10g and choose the stats you want instead of being stuck with the ones on this blue and not being able to sell it at a good value when you're done.

---
If you want to level it's a good way to go, you have tons of content. Totally different class Dynamics to play with as well. Just be prepared for it to feel 'empty' as you level because so there is so much world.
---
It works but it has to be some really concrete shit, like a guy constantly stealing loot in multiple dungeons for no other reason then to do so. A guy pissing you off once in a dungeon isnt going to mean shit to the server enough to not group with a guy just because you said he is "blacklisted", blacklist happens when he pisses off enough that he cant find a group anymore because people know not to group with him.
---
Bit of a strawman on your part.
---
The level at which a warrior does 66.0 or 66.6 dps and gets 4 strength upgrades doesn't have gear that will sell for 10g currently on Classic. Maybe in a month or two when people have disposable income and are established who plan to twink, sure...but that isn't now.
---
Most players don't have that kind of gold to go blowing it on superfluous leveling items, and we're not talking about pre-raid BiS items either.
---
All that aside, if you want to roll Need on items you can only sell, that's fine... so long as you make your own group and tell them that's what you plan on doing up front. Otherwise, plan on being blacklisted and ignored by anyone you do this to.
---
Extra mats yes greens are probably better to sell now since people are leveling and need them. Although they might go up once people start leveling enchanting
---
Apparently because don't know if there is a flight master in Brill I'm supposed to go back to retail.
---
The wrist problem may be due to laptop keyboard!! Just an fyi, ran into that myself while in college lol
---
I do that when I need to contest mobs with other players because that lets me tag more at once, but I'm not sure if it's faster than dealing with them one by one. Also I need to fear on cooldown if I pull 3+ mobs and that can backfire really hard sometimes.
---
You are obviously new to this game, and that's ok. You'll learn.
---
But lying to ninja gear out of spite is totally cool right?
---
Just don't join those groups, problem solved
---
Got around 100g just seeling som greens i got while leveling, selling trash and not wasting money on stuff.
---
you're not bored, you're hitting that wall in the slog and that's normal. if you start over you'll eventually get back to where you are now while losing the chance to hit 60 and make some more progress
---
just stick with your mage until you're at 60, you'd be better off taking a day or two away from the game than starting a new toon.
---
Go underwater before it? Seems a small one
---
Level as arms 2h. Switch to prot at 60 for tanking
---
Don't ridicule companies about things you don't fully understand.
---
From level 35-40 the amount of gold you‚Äôll make goes up a lot. So in my opinion go ahead and buy all the skills, learn to use them as you level. When you get lvl 35 go to STV and kill animals and vendor greys. You‚Äôll make a lot of gold.

One dude looked for a group for vultros in westfall which has a 2day spawn rate. He set the group to master looter or whatever that enables him to loot instantly and the blue dagger actually dropped. He quickly looted it then ran off.
---
I am only 30 yet, but thanks for the warning  :D
---
Sword and board is quite terrible -- both in and out of dungeons.  It's useful to have a weapon swap macro to alternate between 2H and S&amp;B for when shit hits the fan, like when you body pull more than expected, but the damage mitigation is mostly insignificant well into the late game -- you'll take less damage overall just killing faster.
---
That said, the best way to travel is the Friend Ship -- make some friends and watch as your painful solo experience turns into you being the centerpoint of a wrecking ball of pain.

Sure that wasn't a Freudian slip on your part? Maybe this is saying something about your subconscious lol.

It absolutely is true and there's enough people playing by those rules that those of you are are gonna get burned.

I haven't really noticed the DDOS on Stonespine. A few have complained about lag but I have had no issues.

The fact that you can have all your spells, skills and items as buttons on your toolbar instead of having to flick through pages to find them.

You do!!

\*plays violin for you\*
---
Servers never really have balanced faction splits - generally once a server becomes known for being tilted more towards one faction than another, it only gets worse from there.
---
Man, the pure simple joy of this. So glad people get to have these kinds of moments again.
---
Zoomers out

come to classic first :‚Äù) enjoy the stay

Working for your progression is the real sense of accomplishment despite what blizzard says.
---
Alright, thanks.

I just noticed last night that the shield works but it does not do damage! A bug perhaps?
---
He means rolling need on a BOE not going to be equipped. Many people thing that is the norm, many people think need roll is exclusive to gear going to be equipped. Not discussing before a need roll leaves suprises.
---
Yeah standard mouse/keyboard
---
This is terrible advice
---
lol been playing since 2005.
---
ye but your still on foot for like 90% of it.
---
like mage portals are great if you wanna go to one of the 3 towns. blink is okish, but again still walking 99% of it.
---
the only ones i can def see having a better time are the shamans, druids and druids. and even then this is at a min of lvl 20. 
---
this stuff is apart of the draw of classic, but i can 100% see why they gave mounts sooner in the expansions that came after.
---
the entire point of classic, is you start off as a nobody thats weak as shit and then you grow and become a real threat. but boy that start up can be hard particularly for warriors lul
---
i wouldnt change anything because it wouldnt be classic, but i can 100% understand it why they changed some things.
---
Is there an addon that shows sell price of items?
---
Holy shit bro. You. Learn. How. To. Make. It. From. The. Trainer.
---
Thair are a few ways but they are eather cost prohibited or would make the servers chug ddos attacks are some of the simplest cyber attacks but also one of the hardest to deal with
---
First week a blue boe dropped and since i didnt need it i hit greed. Guy in group goes "everyone hit need because its a new server so everyone needs gold" while this guy isnt a ninja that mindset is the problem. Selling an item is the definition of greed people come on.
---
asmongold will see this and be mad cause this has horde doing the killing
---
Royal flush
---
Anything that's required level is near the high end of the BG brackets (19,29,39) and doesn't have complete shit stats is probably valuable to some twink build.
---
They do make levelling more efficient, but I'd never pay for one.
---
Also, I think it almost removes one of the key points of Classic (SUBJECTIVE OPINION) since it just automates the questing process and removes any exploration that you would have done otherwise. Some value efficiency over exploration though, so it's totally down to the individual!
---
Something with amd's apu chips would probably be a solid choice. I think you can get a laptop with the new 3500u/8gb ram/512gb ssd for close to $500.

It 100% was the standard 15 years ago.

I am on Incendius but I don‚Äôt think I would of been in desolate. Probably just a common leveling look lol

My first bad experience was in Duskwood, at 3 HP with a disease *and* poison, a priest walked by me and I whispered asking for a heal (even said please) and they demanded 1g.
---
Not farming but a big thing is managing your gold. Don‚Äôt buy every skill you don‚Äôt need, don‚Äôt buy stuff off AH, etc
---
&gt; This is cool
---
To each their own, but I don't think zerg guilds are cool.
---
Based. I hate Chinese.
---
Every PvP server has a horde bias. Nothing you can do except get good or stop playing alliance.
---
Nope. I know it's technically faster, but I just feel like I'm wasting my time attacking mobs with no reward. Everyone warned me that quests would run out early, but Im lvl 32 and have so many quests I can't pick a zone to focus on. Grinding mobs feels pointless with so many things to do!
---
Get 5/5 unleashed fury in the BM tree. BM is the best spec for leveling.
---
Classic is more challenging but I‚Äôve had much more fun so far. With how populated the classic servers are right now it‚Äôll be much easier for you to form parties. This makes difficult sections of the game easier for newer players.
---
I once got feared around in circles for two hours by a warlock way above my level in STV. Sadly, for him, I knew a guy playing alliance on the same server. My guild, on my main, tormented him for quite a period :P
---
The infinity bags!
---
You can play rerail up to a certain level without buying bfa as i know, and the sub covers classic too, so you can try bith if your time allows it
---
That is not the default by any stretch of the imagination.
---
I've played with numerous randoms since the game launched and, luckily, not a single one of them has been this much of an asshole to me.
---
You don't just assume everyone is cool with you need rolling on shit just to sell it; case in point: I'm not cool with it.
---
You do you, but it is not too much to ask for you to broadcast your loot intentions before you pug a group.
---
Say that to my rainbow warrior. Progressed from red to yellow to blue loincloth with hip plates.
---
Back in vanilla my dad used to make shirts to sell on the ah.  Occasionally id see someone with his shirts and most recently in legion i ran into one of the same old guys who used to wear my dads shirts still wearing them probably wont ever run i to him again sense i no longer play retail but it was always super cool seeing that

I'm playing Druid for the first time. I am leveling 1-60 as Feral, and once at 60, I will switch to Restoration. My question was regarding a Druid class quest reward.
---
Quest:  [https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=9053/a-better-ingredient](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=9053/a-better-ingredient) 
---
I am wondering if I should take Forest's Embrace (Healing Chest) at 50 so that I have a good chest for healing at 60, or am I going to get an equal or better one from dungeons at 60 (if so, what chest and from where)? Compared to Grizzled Pelt (Feral Chest), which has really nice stats for my 50-60 leveling process.
---
No they fucking won't, how are people so dense to think this?
---
This is literally a dispute on a BOE drop in a non dungeon that he even told the guy he was going to need on. Unless that person he grouped with has a ton of server pull to sway the entire realm against this guy (which I doubt) then its going to mean jack shit for the vast majority of players that some random level 30 lost a roll for a BoE he wanted.
---
Whats downranking?
---
Incredibly well put.
---
It was the 'curbing of difficultly' mixed with cross realm that made me quit WoW. I'm fully aware that I won't be able to play like I used to. And in no way do I expect (or want) to be handed end game content. It should absolutely mean something and the fact that people have already clear Ony/Rag makes me sad
---
I just feel the time wasted running is so annoying to me
---
Hahahahaha oh my that‚Äôs funny
---
I agree they might not be that much more fun than a mage but they just look more interesting with things like pet management on hunter and totems on shaman.
---
Exactly. If boots of avoidance drop then the plate wearers just get them? Nope. That's a fat stack of gold that just dropped and everyone should get a fair shot at it.
---
Why would you need to blacklist people from raids? Did you not have a guild to do it with? or your guild was so small they couldn't fill 40 and had to pug people? Wow what a horrible experience it must have been to not be able to play with you legends.
---
From what I‚Äôve heard Kromcrush is fairly balanced
---
That's 6 Gold an hour, worse than pretty much any other way to make money 40/50 ish +
---
If I really needed a service like this and someone non jokingly offers it, I would take it, I mean I pay more for water than this :D
---
in vanilla there was tons of faction imbalance too. total pops don't even really matter, just the people involved and that's usually a tiny part of the population on any realm. if your side doesn't have enough people, go get them but don't be surprised if the side that needs the help is the side that doesnt' get the help
---
people like the path of least resistance and had rather avoid pvp when it's evne a little lopsided
---
there is nothing blizz can do, it's a flaw in the people who play games. they're mostly pussy ass crybabies who had rather not try than lose.
---
Guy. $15/month is $180/year. You get to demand top notch service for $180 for a video game.
---
Not to mention that $15/month across the entire playerbase generates literally millions of dollars every single month. They better be keeping everything running smoothly with that kind of coin.
---
Maces and swords, not daggers
---
This should be the default rule for valuable BOEs. Everyone rolls need, than whoever's wins the loot decides whats best to do with it.
---
*name change: Lyft/Uber
---
&gt;A trend I'm starting to notice while playing is a bit of a faction imbalance. On my current server, it is reported 60 horde and 40 alliance ratio (based off player run census/polls).
---
You have no idea if thats true.
---
And the thing with vanilla is that both factions have geographical advantages and better reach on their respective continent, so if horde decides to fuck up a zone on Eastern Kingdom its always easier for alliance to respond, and the other way around on Kalimdor.
---
All the farmable materials are pretty evenly spread around through vast distances so there is always somewhere to play if one zone is too contested when you want to farm it as well.
---
The same can not be said for TBC tho, but for vanilla world pvp should be completly fine even with 60-40 ratio. 
---
Layering might also a be a huge issue, as people are constantly abusing it, where I have request basically 24/7 when I play the game from people who want phase out from contested layers which just makes the situation worse. If people actually cba to fight for the zones a little bit instead of fleeing it would be a lot better.
---
I don‚Äôt know why but it always annoy me when people call their characters ‚Äútoons‚Äù.

---
I love the hybrid playstyle of druid too much so I always end up training almost everything. I probably could skip Thorns, Wrath, and Starfire, Moonfire, etc, but there are times I'm too lazy to feral everything down and I just put on my Int gear and Starfire everything to death and keep hots rolling.

Welcome to classic wpvp.  It‚Äôs probably not so much faction imbalance as it is just people avoiding pvp. As soon as a faction controls a neutral zone people will swamp it cause they know it‚Äôs safe and the other faction won‚Äôt bother till they leave. STV on my server pretty much flip flops from 100% control by one faction to another until a bunch a 60s clean up.
---
&gt;Do you not understand the difference between greed and need? They put the greed button there for a reason. To sell. don‚Äôt be a the douche that everyone in this game hates.
---
I need the fucking gold, its honestly GREEDY to roll need on a minor upgrade replaced by a dungeon item in 3-4 levels rather than let everyone roll on it.
---
You guys are dense, good thing stupid people dont amount to shit in this game.
---
Weekend is 2 days, record 1-60 is a little over 3 days played. So no, not possible.
---
&gt; but it's tough to pull 2+ mobs for about anyone 
---
Um....no
---
I don't agree. I think there were enough servers back in the day that if you looked hard enough and did your research you could find a good balance on some of them.
---
There‚Äôs something to be said for not having those conveniences. It‚Äôs interesting because it‚Äôs hard to argue against those convenience features when developing them, but after having them I think the net impact they have on the world and the game is negative. Making people leave the city and inhabit the world does a lot for the game. Making travel time matter makes the world seem bigger and more believable.
---
Happened to me with Cassandra‚Äôs grace.. warrior rolled need on it and I‚Äôm a heading priest...
---
Maybe your right, having a level 60 would be good anyway for when I make a second character because I can relax about making the gold for my mount etc and just enjoy myself more.
---
Exactly my thought!

That wrist guard lets me know that you‚Äôre not fucking around.
---
Yes that happens now. Before that change you could only need on an item if you needed it. And even the way it is now, still proves you wrong since blizzard decides who needs it based on class and gives it to someone who can use it and doesn't let anyone roll need on it if they can't use it.
---
Soooo you try to defend your shitty personality by talking about how the system is different than what I described, but the current system still proves you wrong lmao.
---
Streamers bring in players, of course they‚Äôre easy on them.
---
55/45 ally favor on my server.
---
They will. They can so serious time for this. ~10 years or so would not be surprising. It's pretty easy to trace who started it, and others have received jailtime in that same neighborhood before.
---
then you should be on a PVE server. you can't prioritize pve over pvp EVER and play on a pvp server without hating it at times. 
---
for me, i play on a PVP server because it's an extra facet to the game but everyone on a pvp server who gives a shit about efficiency in pvp is going to have a bad time. 
---
it's why blizz went with an on/off system because people who should be on a PVE server always bite off more than they can chew when they join a PVP server. you couldn't have it both ways until war mode.
---
the fact you made a thread about it is 100% proof you don't belong on a pvp server. you dont' wanna hear it, but it's just reality. you prioritize pve a LOT more than you let on or you'd never make this thread once in your life.
---
however they DO have bread and water.
---
What does she play in other games? Maybe just give her a run down of each class and see what appeals to her.
---
I am not home, go to wow classic on twitch mods and it‚Äôs one of the top 5 or 10 downloads. You can find it there
---
This sounds like an early 2000s old wives' tale. Do you have a source?
---
I was fucking heartbroken when I learned this wasn't in Vanilla. Only started playing Alliance in TBC.
---
The mistake you are making is assuming people give a shit about raiding with your garbage guild.
---
Windows key + shift + S to take a screen shot
---
You are playing alliance. You can shit on horde all you want but the fact is your typical alliance player does not give a shit about putting in effort to get good at PvP. Id be willing to bet most of them got bullied into playing on a PvP server. Alliance is and has always been the dad faction.
---
Even if layering was removed, people would probably just get frustrated and quit. Once the pre bis grind ends and there's nothing to do in game for the hardcore players all they will do is camp questing zones.
---
EU &gt; NA?
---
My biggest issue with the current game is class gameplay. It‚Äôs in the worst state it has ever been in for EVERY class. I‚Äôm not about to slog through miles of content if I‚Äôm not having fun.
---
Maths Reddit, what are the chances?
---
because ur playing tank lol  
---
tank is rarer than dps
---
Depends what you're after.  Your priest could go gathering profs, and harvest while you're pulling.   Then you go crafting.  Say priest gets herb / tailoring and you get alch / skinning.  Assuming you're gonna be a tank healer combo, you'll have an easy time farming flask recipes from dungeons.

I still dont understand why there is layering in the zones after Barrens. Im often completely alone in feralas

Um, I think the person claiming loot before it even drops is the entitled one. What's your in-game name so I know never to group with you?
---
Lol this isnt anything new.  This has happened a lot.  Exploit early exploit often is a phrase for a reason
---
I agree with you, but "Literally" doesn't have a meaning they way people are using it. I mean "500g is literally nothing in retail" is exactly the same as "500g is nothing in retail", the word "literally" doesn't change anything in that sentence.
---
I don't want to transfer because I feel like smaller servers will die off and become actual ghost towns

Does anyone actually use the looking for group channel? Or is there a way to link to cities while out in the world that I‚Äôm missing? Or am I just stuck flying back to a city every time I want to run a dungeon?
---
Oh really, tell me more, please.
---
2h, no contest. The chance to miss incurred by DW just isn't worth it until max level or until you get the thrash blade and even then it's a stretch. You're gonna want to pump ur points into arms until you get MS. At which point look for slower weapons with higher max damages, this will make ur MS hit like a truck along with abilities like overpower. The reason being is that the slow speed of the weapon will be compensated for by having a higher max damage, and since MS scales of weapon damage and is instant cast ability you can do an obscene amount of damage if geared correctly.

You should just run to Thalanar (eastern most feralas) and grab the FP.

It keeps blowing my mind that a game that finished development in 2003 is taking a modern gaming industry that is far far bigger now than it was back then by storm. Game designers need to take note I think.

STV or Desolace. I think I did Desolace and then went to STV when I was a bit higher as I was getting ganked a lot when I originally went to STV.
---
South Shore has a lot of quests too, too many horde there on my server though.
---
I appreciate the comment mate, gonna get another video done this week!
---
People cannot seems to grasp the concept of "flexible" joints and why it's worse to immobilize it.
---
The combination for that word is ‚Äúj o a f f‚Äù horde to alliance. Theres a lot of different ones but the main issue is the fact the translation can even exist. Not the player‚Äôs fault. Plus, ive seen some rude allies
---
I like how you have to come up with a very specific situation to justify why you should roll Need on stuff you don't actually need.
---
You want it for greed.  So roll Greed.
---
That's what the button is for.
---
I was gonna name Marge an undead like yours but it was taken and ended up calling it mariguana, Spookymarge Is cool
---
And here we thought men couldn't differentiate between colours!
---
Mad cuz he was a lock? Or am i missing something
---
If you're up front about it, then you're ridiculous to be upset. Just don't join the group.
---
A 60/40 split isn't that bad, and not everyone is going to be online at the same time. With a 60/40 split you're still going to have plenty of times where Alliance dominates a zone and times where horde dominates a zone.
---
Classic has only just launched, a lot of people are grinding instances because that's the meta, not to avoid PvP, you running into more horde ganking is just because at that given moment there were horde interested in PvP / questing in that particular zone.
---
Everyone has been on the same playing field since day one. And we are still in just phase I, not  even really phased by these "exploits" given they've been available to everyone and won't exist for the later duration of the game when more content is coming and there's more demand for consumables, supplies, etc.  
---
Plus, blizz could easily double or even triple mats required by the war effort to balance the economy. So many tools at their disposal, and the game is still fun, no reason to worry unless that's your thing I guess.
---
&gt;You know for a fact he grinded SM?
---
Based on the fact he literally said in this thread he grinded it....
---
...yeah
---
It‚Äôs not, just not a fan
---
Presume away I don't really care. In my eyes rolling need on a BoE blue while grouping without talking it over is ninja looting.
---
Can you fill me in. Do warlocks not use staves?
---
It's a boe blue.

For a documentary, try Looking for group on wows youtube page, it focuses more on wows journey throughout the years, but it does go into some aspects of the game design.

Honestly can‚Äôt be worse than when death knights were released. I remember spending hours stuck in an area one day getting yanked all around. Couldn‚Äôt go 10 feet. Was a nightmare.
---
I don‚Äôt get it

u ment mousepet or catpad?!
---
I said how much it was worth (3.5-5g) and I told him to sell it, the lad thought that I am making an offer (I was making a statement that it's that much that it goes on AH, not offering) - and he opened a trade with me, expecting me to buy it off him. Which just shows that he rolled need just because he saw a blue and he intended to sell it straight after - Worst thing is, I was helping him quest in an lv 22 area when he was lv 19, thanks for nothing I guess.  
---
And yeah, I am salty
---
Every games a huge success the first 2 weeks.
---
I started playing WoW like 2 months before the launch of BC so I didn't really get the "true" vanilla experience so this is just a genuine question. Is it really impossible to believe that someone was capable of making that much gold and getting to level 60 in the 8d 8h timeframe? Is that also within the context of vanilla when it was still shiney and new or in the context of classic where vanilla WoW has existed for 15 years now and there have been many private servers (looking at you nostralius); so people have had the time to refine a leveling path that would lead to hitting 60 with enough gold/rep to get your epic mount?
---
While this may be a genuine concern, I think it's likely that blizzard will take notice of problems like this and come up with fair solutions when the time comes, at least Im hopeful. In another game of mine there were nearly dead servers developers merged into medium sized servers to fix the problem.
---
Same same
---
Save your pw:shield til the tank is about 30%, th n renew, then a big heal. Don't heal the DPS as there are no mechanics that should cause them to get hurt. And yeah druids are mad squishy and he was prob having trouble getting taunts to land as well, due to the level gap.
---
Also as a tip, tanks will not gain rage while shielded so avoid unless absolutely necessary or when using the method I mentioned above.
---
Im pretty sure Skullflame is horde dominated.... but layering fucks everything up so we can't know for sure.
---
All im sure of is that ive only met the same ally two times. 
---
He's died two times. (actually more as i didnt let him farm elementals in arathi and then he attacked me in stv)
---
Pop retaliation or hamstring the 2nd mob and kite.
---
Pretty sure that only requires Honored.
---
The right one is far more sexy!!
---
LOL no

This feature was added when they added flight point "transfers" (travel from A to C via B if A and C are not connected but A-B and B-C are connected). Since they added this function to classic, Divines bless their hands, they of course added the request stop option too.
---
Auctionator is on Twitch, yes.
---
No. You have to roll feral Druid or else he‚Äôs going to lay on your keyboard whenever you want to play.
---
One of the devs....15 years after vanilla launch
---
Yeah I'm on Mankrik and noticed a significant increase in players on my layer. I can't layer off either.
---
Ya I‚Äôm only lvl 16 . I‚Äôm a lock so I‚Äôm foscusing on gold now. I‚Äôm saving all my cloth and half my herbs for end game
---
Warlocks need int and sta so why doesnt he need it?? Unless he already has it or something simalar i dont see the problem
---
&gt;And your thesis is provably wrong because TBC existed.  Classes, races, and faction diversity were not destroyed, the only thing that changed was faction-class availability.  One change, and it ended there.
---
If we used to have A and B, and now we just have AB and AB, diversity hasn't been destroyed?  Giving both factions the same classes is the definition of destroying diversity.  Just because there are still different models and race abilities does not mean diversity hasn't been destroyed.  If I have 5 apples and destroy 2 of them, are some apples not destroyed because 3 are left?  This logic is laughable.
---
&gt;One change, and it ended there.
---
Druids got a non-cd resurrection, which made them more like other classes.  Druid and Paladin tanks got some tools from the warrior kit.  I could go on and on with just TBC, not to mention later expansions.
---
Look, I liked Burning Crusade.  It was my favorite era.  The argument is still sound, and the slippery slope got slid down with WotLK and beyond, where basically every tank/heal/dps class in retail is interchangeable with other tank/heal/dps classes (parallelism, again).
---
I‚Äôd opt for a bed pan

I've heard about Prat causing performance issues, such as stutters and FPS drops. Do you experience that? u/TheJuiceGrenade

Look for a laptop with a dedicated video card.  Any laptop with that, will have the rest of the specs you need.  That said, if you get an integrated graphics card, it's definitely not going to run so hot.

Check for used ones.  I scored a dell gaming laptop with a nvidia 8600, 250g ssd, and 16g ram for $300 on craigslist just by finding the right person that needed money.  Its ran flawlessly for 2 years now.

Yes, it is right now.  I'm literally looking at the window right now for it.

You‚Äôre not missing out, you just haven‚Äôt hit the appropriate level to go to contested zones. Once you do, it changes completely.
---
My husband recruited me, I play druid and love it. Mostly heal but when I play on my own there's versatility. Also, make sure you dance or flirt while playing it's adorable.

Troggs are the creatures I hate the most. In classic and retail (up to level 100) they‚Äôve killed me more than anything else.

WotLK was one of the few betas I got into early. Wed run 5 DK groups and solo dungeons using this bug as CC. Good times.
---
This is flawed logic as everyone but twinks will eventually level out of it regardless of if you get gold or not. But youre just too chicken shit to say youre pissed off you cant be a middle man and get money out of the situation.
---
Ahh, no...  everything on the net is susceptible to this.
---
That's fine, I'm just calling you a dick.  So what's the problem?

And that's pretty cringe trying to act as if the majority of us never played Vanilla.  We did.  We still think you suck.

Yeah that one, cheers
---
I'm on Pyrewood Village (EU)! And I was lucky enough to get my ghost saber the other day :) Echeyakee is also great, but I think I'll save my last slot for Broken Tooth! Or maybe I could branch out and get something that's *not* a cat... I hear wolves are good for dungeons...... hm. Tough decisions lol.
---
This is a classic tale of betrayal and justice. Well played!
---
wow, this hit me. what IF everyone you encounter is a nice person. like theres literally ZERO bad encounters. i cant even begin to imagine how gaming would be. nowadays i ALWAYS prepare for the worst, expect the worst players in my party, gameplay wise but also personlaity wise.
---
how awesome would it be if everyone you get matched up with is nice and fun to play with. instead of 1 or 2 great runs a day youd have 15 or more. holy shit.
---
np fam.
---
The only thing that‚Äôs nice from retail. Graphics and story lol
---
but... I‚Äôm a ret paladin :(
---
Well shit I literally have 1g at Lv 15 now and that's what it costs to respec so I might need to wait
---
Affliction/demo you want to 5-5, 0-2-2-0, 0-0-1 in aff and 2-0-5, 0-3-5, 0-1-0 in demo will get you to 40 then you can respect if you like. Use your VW to lvl and skip the other demon quests till your 40.
---
This specific button wasnt in, but when they added flight transfers you could click a similar button to stop at next fp, even in vanilla.
---
Stick to questing, but once you get later into your 40s I would definitely be farming zome ZF with people until like level 52 I believe, then go back to questing and smash out all the zones you can and then finish off the grind to 60 in dungeons.
---
Pretty much why I always need on boe's. Most dont equip them. They just sell them. Call me a ninja all you want. I dont care tbh. But im not gonna let some asshole claim hes going to use it and then sell it. We all need on them and sell or equip. Simple.
---
there are some somewhat decent damage talents in the holy/disc trees but one major problem you'll run into is that there's no +holy spell damage gear like there is +fire/+frost/+shadow gear for other casters
---
So let everyone on the server know. Reputation matters in Classic, people won't group with ninja looters
---
Actually, distractions are perfectly good way to cope. 
---
Multiple of my therapists have suggested finding distractions alongside working on myself.
---
Wow people that rolled Faerliba really are retarded huh
---
I usually tell groups that I start. ‚ÄúEverybody can roll need on boe blues‚Äù
---
I do both. I quest when I'm bored of dungeon grinding. I dungeon grind when I'm bored of questing.  Download "Atlas Loot" addon from twitch and it will show reccommended levels for each dungeon.
---
This is probably the most "Noobish" comment chain I've ever seen on WoW. 
---
Congrats, I haven't called someone a Noob in over ten years.
---
Lots of people need to Learn to play but arrogant assholes like you *especially* need to learn to play.
---
That's possible. All I can say for sure is we were massively outnumbered in northern stv.
---
Hell no I punt gnomes. The point was I am sure people who are super hardcore at WoW and can't go literally an hour without it, probably haven't been outside in 2 weeks at least.
---
Strength is good for you as a feral druid in classic
---
You can hop between layers by getting an invite and use it to farm mobs/chests/nodes/fishing pools and basically everything much faster. It's how the first 60 level dude did it.
---
I do them because they are fun. Gear is always nice but rarely my motivation since it will be phased out as you level anyways. Also a good way to meet people.
---
I've been on Atiesh since day one and I've really enjoyed it. Let me know if you end up here; you're welcome to the guild I'm in.

---
Pay attention, maybe it will be the only 69 that you will have contact with.

Any mages feeling like shatter isn't working right?  I have the full 5 points and I'm aware it only effects frozen targets, but pretty often, I use nova, get 2-3 frostbolts before it breaks and none of them crit.
---
This is what I was taught as well, rolling just to sell it is a "Greed" greed roll , if someone is legitimately looking at it as an upgrade, and intends to equip it, then roll need.
---
What is you get when ypi sell BoE? Gold
---
What is that you get wen you sell to vendor? Gold
---
Everybody needs gold, IT IS NOT A REASON TO ROLL NEED. Use the greed option that exists in the game. This is not rocket science.
---
"some 100g BoE drops that some dumbass wants to equip for 2 levels."
---
Why is worth 100g? Because some "dumbas" WANTS TO EQUIP IT. So here we have one that wants to EQUIP IT AND USE IT....FOR FREE.
---
You only want gold...that is greed. Simple right?
---
This is the kind of stuff that doesn‚Äôt happen in retail. #community

---
Intellect and strength is the way to go. Agility is Less important!!
---
This is fantastic
---
I took a different route... started with my alt, a Warlock (lvl 33, tailoring/enchanting). Sometime after 40, when/if I get tired of him, I will go back and play my main that I already leveled to 25. That way I can pass off as much gold as I need when my main gets to 40. In the end I will have a pair of 60s to enjoy.
---
I‚Äôm taking the word Queer back and making it a sexual orientation/lifestyle neutral and bringing it back to its original definition.

Or create a separate tab on your chat log for just LFG, just click it whenever you need to look for people its great

As a mage this makes me laugh.
---
Cata was definitely unique, as someone who played vanilla and TBC, then skipped WOTLK, my first login was after Cata launched and they gutted talent trees. I was very confused for a while.
---
Could you level with it and and be a better healer as an upside? That's really what I'm looking for. An alternative to constantly wanding that doesn't mean dipping into Shadow.
---
I mean, there's plenty of reasons to dislike streamer servers/guilds but I thought it was basically universally agreed that the emergent content they'd provide would sometimes be cool. You don't have to like streamer guilds to say that raids on capital cities are cool.

Question so this type of stuff happens mostly on pvp worlds or normal and pvp. My friend and his brother got into wow again before me and picked normal, now if I wish to play with them at all have to play on their normal world but I'm wondering what are we gonna miss out not being on a pvp world
---
If the lock is pure dps, what do you think the mage does?

He had no idea how much it's worth pre-roll, he only learned about the value of it after he won.

Need for use, greed for sell. Easy peasy. If you're only going to use that item on your char for 2 days and then sell it? Roll greed like everyone else and get that sick gold for yourself instead of defending ninjas

I play on US, havent really decided on the server, but feel free to message me if you ever need assistance. I always loved having alts in random places for when server issues occur.

I bet you feel pretty stupid when you see it on AH for 1000 gold with his name next to it the next day. Do you think any lvl 21 rogue is going to equip the Shadowfang he rolled need on? 
---
You are either naive or a hypocrite. Don't tell me you're pressing greed when the remaining four party members press need on a Staff of Jordan.
---
You say that yet I've made tons in profit. I love playing the AH.
---
Yes. I‚Äôve learned from my addiction 15 years ago. I‚Äôm level 12 now in classic and only play when I have time.
---
Epic mount by 40? You can‚Äôt get it till 60. And by looks of it you won‚Äôt have an epic one for a long time after. You should have way more than 2 gold saved by now.
---
Don‚Äôt buy all your skills. I‚Äôm sure you trained some that you don‚Äôt even touch.  You should have increased your profession skill cap up to at least 225 by now. You‚Äôve missed on a gold by not upgrading them.

I am an "arrogant asshole" because I don't roll Need on things I don't actually need?  Sound logic there.

Never realized I was a "noob" for understanding the what the words "need" and "greed" actually mean.  Is there a dictionary I could mail you that might help you out?

---
I don't think you have to be good at pvp to pwn people in classic (unless you are playing a mage or lock I guess), but I just want people to actually be forced into fighting. Most of the ganking is decided by who gets the jump anyways, and its always this tension if the horde near you is friendly or aggressive.
---
I've had a lot of fun wpvp with disgruntled alliance players (those who won't just switch layer but are actually up for a fight) and a lot of them are up for a fight if you are calling out for it. Just say X horde ganked you 10x and lie about it, and they will join.
---
And the most disgusting layer abuse I've encountered is actually from hostile hordes, there was this mage when I was playing early on Saturday that would constantly layer switch, and whenever he was on my layer he would attack me (which is fine) and if I died, he was layered out before I got back. Which is just awful, he would turn up from nowhere by phasing in, and disappear before I could fight him. Which is super annoying because I would have fought him constantly even if I lost every battle, I would just have respawned close and kept fighting him and disrupt his farming.
---
On another note there was these 2 warriors that ganked me while I was farming, I wrote down their names and encountered them like an hour later, called in a druid to back me up so we got into a 2v2 and ambushed them while they were farming, and corpsecamped them for like 10 minutes. That experience was only possible because they didn't layer out and we had that faction hostility which is only really possible in vanilla, and is what I want to have without constant layer abuse.
---

I get everyone has there was of dealing with things. But throwing yourself into a game only to come out of that game to back to your miserable life isnt progress. It's just a cycle. The goal is to break that cycle. I've been there. I had to give up WoW a long time ago because of it. Throwing yourself into a game isnt progress. The next day your still at step one. Play the game. But if you want to make progress dont let yourself be consumed by a video game.

What exactly is occurring in a DDOS attack?
---
Get a feel. You don't need to crunch numbers. When the tank is at 3/4ths health, try a heal 2 ranks down and see how much you top them off. Clothies and leatherbois have less overall health so you'll probably top them off with much lower ranks. However, if the tank is taking big hits or is less than 50%, just drop your biggest heal usually.
---
Not true. You're talking about mitigating legitimate requests as well.
---
People still made bank. Maybe not as much as was claimed, but they still did.
---
I'm back on Destiny 2
---
They don't care who it affects the only thing they care about is their 5 minutes in the lime light.
---
Also everyone wishing for him to be raped or killed in jail really need to take a long look into the mirror, this is a video game, yes he might be ruining your weekend but its not physically hurting you.
---
DDOS attacks are very easy to do if you have access to a big enough bot net, and the only way to defend against it is to have the infrastructure to handle the traffic. 
---
The thing is that scaling the infrastructure would cost a shitton of money. For instance if their current infrastructure handles 100k connections and the DDOS sends one millions request a second, they would have to install the equivalent of 10 times what they have and 90% of the machines won't be needed 99% of the time, so it is lost money. 
---
And then, even if they scale it to support one million, the attacker will just pay for a bigger botnet and send out 5 millions requests. Bot nets are way cheaper than the infrastructure needed to defend against it.
---
Currently the "cost effective way" to defend against it is to wait for the attack to happen, and then configure the network to block those connections and re-route the proper ones. This has to be redone every single time tho.
---
Some group, or a person, likely a novice launched a DDos attack on a few blizzard servers and some other sites. It‚Äôs been occurring randomly for the past 2-3 days. No ones been caught yet.
---
Amen, brother. I give stones to people waiting for the zeppelin with me, or randoms i group up with for a quest.

But I'm legit chat banned til tomorrow night. What a fucken nerd snowflake
---
As I stated elsewhere, it's about cost. Scaling resources in order to ensure that you're able to handle the traffic while out matching the incoming data is essentially the game. Outpacing the attack, essentially. We've seen blizzard does not engage in these practices as it would cost them money, and they would prefer to pass the pain and suffering along to the subscriber, instead.

I think he means he specifically likes to kill mobs in WoW.
---
You seem really toxic and immature.
---
Chill Winston, the great thing about these things is you dont have to do them, and if lots of people on your server are making lots of gold or resources (or both) then itll make for a good boost in the server economy. Either you'll be able to work for money and buy the resources, or you'll be able to sell your resources and services because people will have plenty of gold.

Capitalist wow

Myzrael down boys

Meanwhile I did not have a single bag drop until level 50 or so....

BOE is fair game.  It was fair game in vanilla too.
---
If the plate wearer needs an upgrade he can still buy it.  He doesn't automatically deserve a BOE because he can wear it.  He could just as easily change his mind and sell it himself.  For greens it doesnt matter so much, they arent worth a lot, but blues are rarer, more powerful and worth a lot more.
---
yeah hahaha being a toxic asshole is so funny hahaha /s
---
Just made it back in on Bigglesworth
---
his twitter got suspended yesterday. wonder where he will post from today to stroke his ego
---
Today is better because NFL is on. So now it's just reddit shitposting and NFL til servers back.
---
Well I guess it depends lol like where do you draw the line between casual and / non casual?
---
 cloudflare and such companies offer ddos protection that works. The thing is it makes your traffic slower, and costs a LOT. Certain pservers actually had ddos protection but I imagine the attacks on them were much smaller than this

Yup it‚Äôs aids

You can literally buy them for 8s. I had full bags by level ten or so
---
But...
---
I don't wanna.
---
thats $3/$15 aka 20%. Do I want 20% off on things that I purchased? Yes I do.
---
I thought it was wow classic not wow basic
---
You know it's one thing to hack shit for personal or monetary gain but to shut down game servers on a weekend so that people who have been waiting at work to play all week cant even do that, that's just some low scumbag subhuman tier bullshit. Theres a special spot in hell for you, asshole.
---
It's just so menacing.  And back in the day, I envied all who had that mount.
---
You sound very entitled, especially given that this isn't blizzard causing the issues.
---
We're monitoring it too, Blizzard.
---
Whelp, out to see the real world, it's still there right?
---
Yeah I got the whole house cleaned yesterday. I guess I be doing some other type of chore to get some brownie points üòÇüòã
---
Lol, it's a pretty simple system.  Need and Greed.  You're a dick if you abuse it for profit.  Especially when there's no BGs to twink and there's no large amounts of gold in circulation.
---
servers gettin ddos'd bro keep up
---
I wanted to skip regular mageweave bandages so I made heavy silks at cost until 240. 239-240 took at least 300 bandages. I was actually starting to suspect it was grey and it only looked green because of a display bug
---
Yeah.. The Barman Shanker is a 2 speed dagger and used to hit like a truck. After the nerf to weapon speed it was useless.
---
Eagles, I'm watching them lose against the Redskins, who they were +10 favorites against. But such is the nature of Philly sports, blowing leads since the dawn of time
---
I was actually in this fight. Got killed a lot. Being a low level warrior sucks.
---
Thanks!!
---
Yes. And I am even fan of the theory that a proper LFG tool (not automatic matchmaking) that allows people to get into groups faster would improve quality of conversation, too, because, you know, you would actually have a group and people to talk to.
---
Rested xp isn't such a big deal till you are further along in levels anyway, so don't be too hard on yourself :)
---
/cast Powerword: Fortitude.
---
Wand about equals smite if you have a good one, maybe even better, in base, though you'll probably do higher DPS due to crit chance with Smite...excepting that your bubble isn't going to last and you'll start getting interrupted.
---
You can do more damage with spells, but you're going to blow all your mana - so wands help preserve mana while still allowing damage output.
---
In group, if you're healing, you want to preserve your mana for healing, but have something to do while you're not healing so you don't feel useless, hence the wand
---
I‚Äôm sure it will be shared eventually

DDoS doesn‚Äôt particularly care about your resources, and legitimate traffic can sometimes appear to be a DDoS(like that time Anthems launch killed their own internal authentication servers).
---
For the most part, you can stop the traffic getting to your internal network, but you can‚Äôt stop your edge device, or your providers edge devices from being impacted.
---
If some tool decides to peg your ISPs 100gbit connection, it‚Äôs still traffic that has to get to the device and the device has to drop the traffic. If you have two, or three, or four ISPs, for the most part traffic will flow through maybe one or two of them at once, and failing to another ISP just moves the problem. 
---
On edge devices this inspection/drop happens at line rate, so even if you‚Äôre pushing 100gbps through the interface, you won‚Äôt get drops.
---
You will when you try and send 101gbps though, and the ISP says ‚Äúthis is enough‚Äù and delays the traffic.
---
Your computer, expecting a response, sends another which compounds the issue.(albeit in a minor fashion compared to the actual DDOS)
---
Blizzard would have to break their authentication services out to a cloud solution that provides DDoS protection via dynamic ips and dns, and then everything behind that as well. 
---
It‚Äôs very difficult to block DDoS attacks, and many times the mitigation‚Äôs they put in place impact actual customers.
---
I thought so, thank you. Game is really fun but Ill be patient.
---
Ditto, absolutely beautiful color pattern!
---
Now they're attacking the ISP which bnet/blizzard is using.
---
Already have. Rectal cancer will be a real bitch.
---
Do weapon procs have an internal cool down and how does that work with wind fury? Say I have a weapon that has a chance to blast the target with shadow damage. Could all 3 basic attacks potentially trigger that proc?
---
James bond theme

Those comments lol. Bunch of people talking shit while having no idea how a DDOS works

Don't let the haters sway you, they are a TON of fun and extremely effective for leveling whether you're solo or grouped. Up until end game they can fill any role, whether it's tank dps or heals. It's not "the best" but it's like 80-90% effective and you can make up for whatever strength your character might lack by just playing well.
---
Herod down..
---
Oceanic servers are up if you can make it to the login screen. I became a refugee on Remulos!
---
Damn sounds like my life.
---
I was gonna chime in but you're both worthy of downvotes. Your post did point out that there are some fundamentals you're missing, but lashing out at someone being a dick about it makes you a dick too.
---
You clearly know enough to know that SM/Ruin was the raiding spec of the day, but not enough to know how to get into it? The gaps in your knowledge are small, and the effort you're investing into this post could have already answered the small amount of information you're missing. Expecting others to do your homework for you when you're so close, then responding like this, does come across as straight laziness.

Okay so everyone is up in arms on the need to sell vs greed to sell and all that, but can I need to disenchant? I really need those mats....

That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing, i appreciate all of the responses friends. I feel like I need to work on optimizing my travel time and efficiency I just don‚Äôt know how to go about it ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è

It'll all be worth it when i read the story about these people going to jail for 4+ years. Gives me 2 days to catch up on TV i've missed.
---
Can someone ELI5 how this can continue to happen to a large company's servers?  Wouldn't Blizzard have some protections in place against this type of attack?
---
just ban Asmongold, he brings shits like that with his edgy followers.
---
he did, he brought twitch and Wikipedia down yesterday too. Not much you can do against a DDoS unless you are built for insane traffic (ie amazon/google).
---
It's nice to be able not to worry about optimizing and just play for fun. Everyone helps with development and crafting means something.
---
Yeah that's for your own good so they down overload the servers and crash again
---
Updates?
---
Thank you bud.
---
Yep, I was in the middle of running across west fall and bam entire thing goes down

Some DDoSers tried to bring down Amazon a few Black Fridays ago. They called it off after 2 hours because it was impossible.

Holy paladins are not christians. The follow the light not jesus.

Is this just NA or EU? I've been online on a EU server most of the day without any problems.

im betting atleast one of your characters is above the average level right now.

Probably worth noting that healing as druid either means you get to cast rejuv and you get gear, or you dont get to cast rejuv and you're sitting their casting HT and gear is probably funneled to the rejuv druid.

If you are a priest, you already are trained on wands.

They *just* took down the layering this morning. Try playing again and seeing if that fixed your grievances. Personally, zones are crazy busy now.
---
I'm pretty sure it was a joke my guy.
---
And if it still doesn't work, it means he didn't clean it well enough.
---
EQ has been doing servers like this for years. They call them "Timelock Progression".

They're fun, it's what I've played the last 5 years exclusively, but the community just isn't the same.

Are not Wiki and Twitch AWS (Amazon) ? He was taking them down yesterday.
---
Neat!
---
Prison time is a perfectly valid response for breaking the law.
---
Rape is not.
---
He shouldnt have to. Most people in WoW arent using "regular" names. If someone wants to be named Christianity there is no reason they shouldnt be allowed to. Blizzard shoudlnt cater to some whiny people because "i dun like his name ;(". That's pathetic. 
---
There is a guy on my server named "Preteencream" that has been around since classic launched with no issues, but somehow "Christianity" isnt allowed as a name? Come on....
---
I was just as surprised when I rolled into desolace for the first time and just saw them walking around, like no big deal.
---
Now thats a good response. Whats with the toxic trash downvoting? "oh no! This guy ask a question because he was curious! Quick, we must downvote and make sure no one ever questions WoW in anyway!".
---
I *wish* I had someone handy for water breathing when I came up on those reef quests in STV, ended up skipping them other than the easy tablet. Instead, the only buff I ever got from a friendly warlock was Curse of Recklessness.
---
&gt; (..)which is usually very illegal
---
Botnets are by nature illegal, since its definition is a network comprised of infected machines. 
---
Generally this type of mischief doesn't come with heavy prison penalties (unless you're American then it's probably 30 to life or something ridiculous). From what little i've followed this, it seems that the miscreant behind this is young - And (again unless American) that tend to alleviate prison sentences.
---
Botnet operators tend not to get heavy penalties due to the use of DDoS but because they use their Botnets for CC fraud.
---
Your a sheep
---
You remember 50 years ago you old boomer fuck?
---
You dont bat an eye with that guy calling me scum  for giving a reasonable differing opinion but get offended when I clapback their toxic responses.

Fuck off you retarded boomer, you only care because you yourself feel targeted. You don't care about toxicity towards others, you only care about this because it relates to you.

Zomg I‚Äôm switching to alliance!

That was on my main server. But then I transferred. Sorry to see ya struggling!

I might be wrong but I'm pretty sure that only works for weapon skills lol, not professions.

"I understand, thank you." - Mankrik.  Everyone gets all upset over that story but that's all that Mankrik manages to say when you tell him. Nevermind that before he finds out the MF has a bloodfeud with the Klokar or whatever.

Lol seriously? Wow.

Oh yeah I suppose that makes sense.   Lol woops, since classic I kind of forgot about retail.

yooo the legendary goblinpiledriver in the classicwow sub? how you feeling about goblins in modern bruh
---
I tried explaining that in this subreddit at one point and got a ton of hate.  People are trying to justify being ninjas and they don't care how they do it.  They invented this ridiculous logic that BoEs can be sold for money, everyone needs money, therefore everyone should roll need, and anyone who wants to equip it is wasting everyone else's money.
---
Oh God, I may have to go outside for the second day in a row.
---
I don't think either of those criminals should be raped in prison.
---
Mankrik, is that you?

Just say you wanted christian but it was taken and your last name starts with s.

People suck.

Yeah, you're totally right, I'm a dumbass. Still it is a great mount, although I think I'll be going for that PvP Nightsaber

How did a guild like that end up on Whitemane-NA, with a guild named after a Twitch Emote?

No need to train multiple ranks, just the one you want to use

Because for a lot of people, myself included, they are trying wow for the first time. Servers being down all the time is not a good first impression that will keep people around.

I wont quit over it because I'm capable of understanding they cant really do anything about it until they find him and arrest him, but not everyone is smart enough to realize that.

God I miss Penance...

But there‚Äôs no need to shame those who find a way to cope. Again, your experiences are not everyone else‚Äôs. Meaning that just because you find coping as a sort of stalemate with these thoughts, some people can actually overcome these thoughts through coping. Not trying to bash you or anything I‚Äôm just saying it really does help some people and some do find great progress through it

Warriors don't really gain the ability to feasibly pull more than 1 mob at a time until SS and even with sweeping strikes it requires you to pool rage on a single mob beforehand

Guy today sold an Assassin's Blade for 10g... Definitely a solid long-term investment for the buyer. I have gotten several Blue BoE's for cheap bid-wins myself. Some I've flipped for triple or more, others are longer-term investments I'm holding on to.
---
Most people level as arms. Fury doesn't get good until you start getting end game gear and prot doesn't give enough damage. Even if you're tanking arms is fine until end game. At end game fury for DPS, prot for tanking, arms for pvp and early end game pve.
---
I've wondered, how would I notice if one of my devices is part of a bot net?  Assuming a virus scan or malware couldn't find it.  Would I notice from internet/data usage spiking?  Is it obvious?  (Not a cybersecurity knowledgable person)

I only buy the finest 20 oz decanters of Asmongolden Showers. Homeboy is making bank and we ain't even in Waterworld economy.

I got banned. I'm done with the game and it's toxic community. Thanks though
---
I'm dense? You mean making up unrelated situations and not understanding how crime is ISN'T dense since that's exactly what you're doing. Dragging something out of context is NOT an intelligent way to argue, good job. You are ignoring a lot of what has been said just so you can make some unrelated comparison? Acting as if all crime is = to punishment is such that is wrong with the system, and it shows do to prison overpopulation EVERYWHERE. The country is in spiral because if it because people like you wanna lock people up for petty inconveniences. Grow up and learn something.
---
People having lots of fun. Some people can only play on weekends, someone decided to attack servers with DDos and servers have been down part of yesterday, and are now recently down again today. Upset people wanting to play a beloved game.

I can get on a few of the other servers but Herod just kicks me each time.

It could be a bug but I found when one player initiates the mission with Tyrion there is a long time once the robot goes off where Tyrion stands there unable to give or receive quests.
---
Yeah honestly I am genuinely confused by this thread. Why the fuck would I pass the roll on an item worth 15+ gold, especially this early into release. So the random warrior can have a mediocre upgrade for 3-4 levels? 
---
Oh fuck off, if they're my friends/guildmates then sure, I'll pass it on. But absolutely 0 chance whatsoever in a random pug.
---
There's literally nothing that can be done against DDoS.  It's why Amazon and Twitch got brought down by it before he set his sights on Blizzard's servers.  If someone had the time &amp; money, they could keep this going indefinitely, until Blizzard moved to a different ISP.  Then what?  It's a matter of time until they get that information too and start over.  The reason this doesn't happen all of the time is due to the cost associated with doing it. This guy is just really, really pissed off and willing to burn his money to get revenge on the WoW Streamer that messed w/ his girl.

You absolutely did, and I'm not your buddy (not sarcasm)

Not directed at this post specifically, good meme.

I just googled gold sellers and checked 3 different sites with that rate. Of course it's likely inflated due to the hype and lack of level 60s.

Retail and Overwatch get affected aswell, its just the nature of the attack

STV always is rough tho.. arathi highlands and Badlands were a bit of a surprise.

I think just about anyone can achieve Rank 10 unless they're super casual. It gets a lot grindier past 10.

Biggle buddy. I love this. Bigglesworth truly is the best server.

So rather than hitting the servers directly they're now hitting their peering arrangements. That's actually kind of smart

are you slow my dude?

I could have changed my name, of course. But I strongly feel I shouldn't have to, just because a bunch of snowflakes/trolls decided to report "Holy Pally LFG SM Cath" as offensive.

2. Yes, the damage gets added to the ignite dot. Multiple mages can stack that dot to do massive amounts of damage. The Mage who started the ignite gets the whole damage credited and has to manage the threat.

You're an idiot

Not sure. I don't think I'm high enough lvl though.

Try soloing SFK at lvl 21 up to the stables as a paladin for the class quest (including committing suicide to get the door open of course).. an HR total.. only to be dcd and servers down for an HR and then the whole thing reset including the damn door being shut.

At higher levels maybe. This is probably aimed at low level players without flight paths p.OP could be level 15 for all we know. I'm level 27 and I make maybe 2 gold an hour if I try really hard.

What classes work well with leveling with a rogue on a pvp server? I'm thinking rogue for the dual stealth, but then there's gear competition and it'll be tough to get into dungeon groups together. I also thought about going druid but they're making a gnome rogue so can't really quest together until later unless they decide to make the trek over to teldrassil and there's still a similar leather gear competition problem. So I guess my choices left for starting in the same zone are warrior, warlock or mage. I'm pretty open to all 3 of these classes. What do you all think about these pairing with a rogue for casual leveling/pvp?
---
Wouldn't you be when you find out that your wife died?
---
Lol. I like that. Maybe I'll see if that's taken.
---
At least all of you can conjure more, i kept having to look for a mage to conjure mine lol

I‚Äôm also playing for the first time and made my first gold yesterday around lvl 16. I looked at some guides so I also got my professions going (or at least planning to) and made sure to know what the best weapons etc. are for my priest. Just because I‚Äôm new, doesn‚Äôt mean I have no idea how mmos work in general.
---
Yea well when you are that close to OOM it's better to cast low cost abilites so if it does get resisted you can cast again. 
---
You thinking this is stupid is probably why you get owned in pvp.
---
&gt;smOrc  &gt;mostly tauren in the guild
---
Its funny cuz shit usually goes into sewers and undercity is a horde capital.
---
why does everything have to be a conspiracy, even this where people have openly admitted to doing what blizzard are saying they‚Äôre doing
---
I can log into virtually every other server, but Herod.
---
I can't log in on Whitemane.
---
har ni sett att √∂√∂√∂h us servrarna blir ddosade
---
Cleave is a term PvP players use for aoe melee teams that can just tear two or three targets apart. Warriors using sweeping strikes and cleave, rogues using blade flurry etc.
---
Haven't heard it used in vanilla much, thats more tryhard than I want in my classic
---
Lol, what a ridiculous comment. Heard the same thing from both sides for the past 15 years.
---
Imagine being this retarded lmao
---
ty!!
---
I reached Lvl 44 yesterday. I feel a great sense of pride and accomplishment.
---
Maybe I worded it wrong or poorly. What I was saying is that if you wanted to DDoS servers or whatever no one will ever know it was you. But if you're dumb and announce to the world "look at me, it was I who attacked your servers!" Then people far smarter than you will not only find your real name but where you live, your phone number, all your email addresses you use, probably even find your family and their personal information too.
---
So you need to remain anonymous and not tell people you're messing with their servers and keep a low profile about it. But I'm sure 99% of the people who do this kind of shit want the attention but are also stupid and can't cover their tracks.
---
You ever seen FMA? Same reason the Elric brothers burned their old house to the ground when they left home. No going back.
---
i play horde ashkandi, lock, and have never spent more than 10-12 min forming a group lol
---
Explain again why this delusional community doesn‚Äôt want transmog? 
---
This is the only group of people that will say ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt want transmog in classic‚Äù and ‚Äúlook how awesome my matching set it is‚Äù in the same breathe. 
---
I am absolutely loving my classic wow experience but shit like this is just fucking mind boggling.
---
Nah, still a script kiddie. He had to ask for server IPs
---
Make sure to apply your spf 10,000.
---
I was a lvl 60 shadow priest on Uther.  Started on release day.  Made it to High Warlord before the pvp system got f‚Äôd.  Pretty sure I remember you!!  I just can‚Äôt remember your name and it‚Äôs driving me nuts.
---
Watch out for a mage named Zeddecus gunna put you in the dirt where you belong alliance.
---
This isn‚Äôt saying horde are shit. Toilets aren‚Äôt shit. Horde is the toilet so when they put in the toilet must be the alliance. Compliment received.
---
"how could it take?  8 hours?"
---
Did the crates-to-wall sconce jump not work back then?
---
mice
---
Exactly cause it doesnt matter what the first person rolls its just the 1/100 for the 2nd person to get the same roll.
---
Considering there was a [blue post just last night about increasing cooldowns for layer changes](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/new-increasing-cooldown-for-changing-layers/290703), I'm gonna say that layers are still a thing.
---
Boom! Roasted.
---
Btw you need 90 Gold for Mount not 80, i got mine at lvl 42, i just sold all Greens and unescessry things, i got herb and tailoring as proffs but im banking every herb that i get.
---
Yep, it won't get better than this. Blizzard delivered almost the perfect product, the only thing that could have been improved is the removal of layering or tackled abuse much earlier, and if they started with pre 1.7 itemization (which would have slowed down the progress quite a lot).
---
Vanilla is just in its own league when it comes to WoW, far above any other version of the game.
---
I feel called out, in a good way, as a paladin spamming my buff everywhere and giving a random heal every now and then. Also, I got two green gear (sword and belt) as I ran around. I love the herd mentality of helping each other out.
---
it would be neat to see them releasing things that were scrapped and didn't originaally made into the game
---
Is their apartment rent controlled?
---
They might get a decent job after jail time though. DDOSing on this scale will at least put them behind bars for a year. There's a precedence for it.
---
Qa aa as
---
my ,
---
"Christianity" as a name in itself isn't offensive. Who gets to decide what's offensive? If someone is offensive to me should blizzard ban it? Of course not that's ridiculous. 
---
If someone wants a name that stands out they should be allowed that. People have wild names in WoW all the time, and a lot of them "remind people of real life bs". 
---
It's not like the guy is trying to name himself something vulgar or foul.
---
Hmmm, I haven't played one yet in classic, but as a Warrior around 27 I see my mage buddies having an easier time. What talents are you playing around, and have you been to DM/WC to get some better gear yet?
---
What part of "attacks towards certain internet service providers" did you not read? No one is ddosing the backend. All major online services are available. Blizzard's server is getting ddosed and they don't know what to do. They are making shit up.
---
WHIRLWIND AXE COMIN‚Äô THROUGH BOYS
---
Herod down as well.
---
Can you give us a list of acceptable topics to joke about please so as not to offend you in the future.
---
Which realms? The popular ones are all high and faerlina is full. Herod is still dead.
---
Did you by chance go get water and make food after you logged off?
---
I said the punishment for ddos is up to 10 years. That‚Äôs literally what the law states. Quote me where I said anyone who breaks any law should be put in jail for years.
---
He only brought down SA servers it looked like for twitch
---
It's far more than thousands. Try hundreds of thousands into the millions.
---
Tell that to the GM that I spoke to after my name got banned who said "preteencream" wasnt against the ToS, lol
---
having the same issue on whitemane too bro.
---
The golden age of comedy when everyone could shit on anyone then do some coke afterwards.
---
If I were more savvy and cared less about my personal well-being...those manufacturers would be the ones i'd be attacking to make a point.
---
Omg I didn't see him. What a fucking hero
---
You understand layers all share the same q right?......right?
---
Thankful for NFL RedZone in these trying times.
---
R6S? it was released around the time of bloodborne and since then we‚Äôve had DS3 and sekiro, behave
---
Haha yeah I do have two monitors just being lazy :P
---
I don't see any option for this.
---
Where do you unlock the secondary professions?
---
I'm pretty sure you can't name yourself after religions. Islam would get banned too
---
"So once you believe that equipping the item is a poor choice for anyone then obviously you aren't going to see the benefits in passing on your chance for the best use of the item just because someone else wants to waste the opportunity."
---
The best use of an item is equipped and being used in combat.  I didnt invent anything, these are your own words just trying to justify your greed. An item forever flipped is of lesser value then someone using it for even half a level. Gear is made to be used not for a stand in for Azeroth stock. Also you took it as a personal attack because deep down you know you are a greedy sack of shit trying to justify your greed over pixels.
---
What a parasite! Hope they bust his hole in prison.
---
you sound hurt.
---
Laugh a little.
---

---
All i hear in this post is that you got reck'd? And now cry abit that some ppl are more tryhard than you would like them to be? Good post.
---
I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre right. As a third party with no interest in this argument. 
---
Whatever ways you can make money is a viable way to make money. That‚Äôs how I understand the term
---
Anyone looking for money to refund .50 cents a day game time probably shouldn't play wow since it would appear they are strapped pretty thin if that's the case.
---
I liked RD2 but was wildly disappointed with online. But D3 came out a long time before RB6, I think around 2012.
---
We need fire res. There's this huge ball of fire boss.
---
Yeah that's my point. Person claiming DDOS attacks keeps saying he's going to keep hitting Faerlina because he likes listening to [Asmongold cry](https://giphy.com/gifs/94EQmVHkveNck)
---
Has anyone seen the issue where seems random that someone gets invited to guild and their name is in Chinese characters and then you see spamming of online and x person joins guild and you see the leader get kicked. But in the end nothing seems to have occurred in said guild.
---
I've seen this happen multiple times the other night.
---
Suspension seems over the top but I completely understand the forced rename
---
In settings there is an option to block all chat channel invites. Life saver tbh.
---
Not your name anymore seeing as its suspended :)
---
Because everybody was writing thinkpieces about Gen X in like 1997.
---
Why? Stealth and invisibility are two separate things
---
Almost all instances are raidable with up to 10 people.
---
I did this the other day and then promptly got disconnected and sent back to the graveyard when the loading screen appeared.
---
Classic is such a weird packet. People finding joy in stuff they avoid like the plague in retail.
---
So, not that many people... There's dozens of you.
---
nvm
---
When people use literally the wrong way, it literally takes away the meaning of the actual word.  And its stupid because then they have to clarify if they were using the actual meaning of literally or the informal(retard) form of the word.
---
fucking wow
---
This is the one fringe case where the trackpad is *actually* superior for once.
---
... as a long time fromsoft fan that's not saying much.
---
People seem pretty forgiving with tanking mishaps (dps pulling threat off you and having to tank a mob, taunts being resisted, sunder missing/being dodged/parried multiple times in a row)
---
Wow, that‚Äôs..something. gg
---
I-i I cant feeel my mana man, where TF is my mana aaaaaahahhhhhhhhhhgod why?!??!?!?!?-My Hunter.
---
I didn't know it's winter already because i see a lot of snowflakes.
---
Do you see me throwing a tantrum?
---
Good thing I have work, I guess..
---
It‚Äôs only greedy if you DONT want to sell it, and just keep it for no reason. But then after you keep it for no reason you realize you can just sell it. However by then the bag mojo has worn off.
---
Lawful Evil solution
---
Blizzard could simply make a VPN service that requires Battle.net / WOW authentication, and only accept connections from here.  There are many different ways to do it, especially for a paid service/game.
---
Ive heard rumors of this "outernet".
---
What "rights" are you referring to, exactly? ActiBlizz is a for-profit company, and you agree to the ToS when you create your account. Your "rights" don't apply. 
---
Stop trying to drum up sympathy. You're looking in the wrong place for it.
---
Lol Nah, not that vengeful. Billiards is my IRL past time.
---
Warlock here, does anyone have a working soul shard deleting macro for drain soul? All the ones I've found online don't actually delete them when the soul bag fills up.
---
I fart in your general direction!
---
I disagree.  It's nice of them when they offer it, but lacks class to ask for it.
---
Imagine you're at a restaurant.  The food takes a long time to come out, so the manager comes to your table and says *"folks, I am so sorry for the wait.  We apologize for some issues we are having in the kitchen.  We'd like to treat you to a dessert on the house!"*  When that happens, it is a very kind gesture and usually appreciated.
---
Now, imagine the food was taking a long time, but the manager doesn't come out.  Some person flags down their waiter and says *"excuse me, we have been waiting a long time on our food, what are you going to do to make this right?  We demand free dessert!"*  This comes across as entitled, tasteless, and really kinda shitty, in my opinion.  Don't be this person.
---
He just wanted to PLAY!
---
Yikes man that's rough. There's very little incentive to socialize on retail. But on classic you have every reason to. Last night I found myself lost in a cave in stonetalon. A group of warriors invited me and, even though I had no quests there, I helped them kill things for a good half hour.
---
The biggest problem with paladin tanks is lack of taunt. While they are great at generating threat while getting smacked in the face, if a mob gets loose they are stuck unable to get it back on them to generate the threat they normally do.
---
As for healers, they are incredible healers, arguably the best priest, alongside priests.
---
China will not extradite ever lol
---
Tried Thousand Needles south of Barrens?
---
Id see if you could grind a few lvls in dungeons until you can handle the higher lvl mobs
---
Booty bay doesn‚Äôt open til phase 2 tho.
---
Thanks, this is pretty handy!
---
I'm also on Whitemane and it can't find my characters.
---
Hahaha sexual violence is such a rampant part of our CO system that it's just seen as part of the sentence xD nothing more hilarious than sexual assault xDxDxD
---
it's not a ddos, it's the thousands or player in waiting queue keeping relogin
---
Shimmering Flats in Thousand Needles or Hillsbrad if you haven't finished them.
---
Whitemane with this issue as well. Cant log on main, alts, or create new characters; get the same error.
---
I‚Äôm thinking of joining as well, any tips you can give?
---
This happened in one of my groups too, a rogue needed a mail piece the warrior tank could use and after everyone in the group gave the rogue shit he ended up giving it to the warrior.
---
Mark goes to the lock, thorns go to the blueberry. If i have the spare mana ill give it mark too :p
---
Have you ever seen the hacker and asmongold in the same room together??
---
Hes christian what do you expect religion of blindness, mindless followers
---
Paladins are incredible healers in both pve (best tank healer) and pvp and blessings make them very desired (esp BoF for warriors in pvp). They can tank just fine - esp once they get consecrate they have insane aoe threat but you‚Äôll notice they go OOM quickly so either come with lots of waters or try to make sure you have a mage with you for free water (and you can‚Äôt really chain pull since you‚Äôll have to drink every other pull of so)
---
Can u explain how you make gold from this I am curious.
---
so you were warned, ignored it, and banned for doing it again.
---
Seems fine to me.
---
Are references to 90s Mike judge movies okay with you or nah?
---
Yo tell us the name so we dont play with this guy
---
Herod down afaik
---
Good grief, it's a one day suspension, not a ban.
---
Besides, you brought this on yourself.
---
who calm down there jokerd, some of us don't have that kind of time, i just killed my first boar 3 days ago, waiting for the servers to come back up for kill number two!
---
Block them, every time.  Yes, they just pop up a new - it‚Äôs why Blizzard has so much problem policing them.  I‚Äôm about 99% certain blizzard takes those reports and ignores them.
---
Where exactly I don't see it
---
Ah, I was not aware of that. Then I won't have to think about this any further!
---
Why would you waste time being a dick?
---
same here, whitemane.
---
thx random dude from the internet
---
Is that an MSI GL73? Same laptop I got and it looks the same.
---
It happened twice to me as I was trying ursal @\_@, her thiccness couldn't save me.
---
what a fucking mess of a company
---
Pretty much this.
---
I thought retail was a singleplayer RPG?
---
I mean you had to wait anyways and this way at least noone got to gank you
---
Upvote for BotW. Amazing game.
---
Those in SM are fine. Just wait for respawns, which are very quick, kill them, repeat.
---
Confirmation and sampling bias
---
nice
---
This is brilliant lol. I wish you had video
---
Anyone know if servers are fixed yet?
---
It‚Äôs either ppl who are really chill, people who are oblivious weebs who hate anything that isn‚Äôt easy for them, or ERPers just going at it in public. It‚Äôs a great game.
---
Well yeah there were no video games back then you incite people to violence
---
Looking for answer to this as well. I haven‚Äôt decided which server to play on. Definitely don‚Äôt want que times and no streamers.
---
That's such a compliment mate you don't even know haha, appreciate the kind words fella. Gonna try get another video out this week :)
---
Yea that's just not true they don't share the same infrastructure at all.
---
the pentagon has invited me over to receive medal of honor
---
But they have gotten caught in the past are currently in prison. Why do they get caught? Cuz they want attention and that will always give them away.
---
Nice!!
---
I want to know where the cutoff is?  I 've seen this argument for flask recipe drops.  Sure, an alchemist needs it, but let's say the recipe is 600g on the ah.  Is it wrong to equate the drop to 600g being rolled on?  A tailor could sell the recipe and get the equivalent of a rare tailor pattern from the ah, so does he not need the drop for the same purpose of the alchemist in the group?  I don't think this situation is as black/white as everyone makes it out to be.
---
https://reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d0f8no/horde_only_dont_forget_repeatable_fish_in_a/

That error is because they are being DDoSed

Who
---
Right so why bother blocking them
---
Fake lol
---
What makes you want to be so toxic to people online? Calling everybody that replies to you a retard just makes it obvious that you're some angry kid. Take your own advice on civility and I'm willing to bet youd find yourself in fewer altercations.
---
F in chat!!!
---
The attacker has been rotating between servers and streamers since yesterday.
---
No one is asking you to pass. There's a greed option for a reason. It's not surprising that you are confused by common sense.
---
its the internet  
---
the guys are guys, the girls are guys, and the kids are FBI
---
Didn‚Äôt even think about using it to equip different weapons thanks
---
Same there, but AC
---
I run shadowed unit frames and can't get my target cast bar to show. It doesn't show over my name plates addon either. I don't know how to disable the blizzard cast bar.
---
Are there any good cast bar specific addons for classic?
---
How do you like Stalagg? Is the faction balance/activity seem balanced? I'm moving off my current server and looking for a new horde home. I was thinking Skeram as well, but faction balance seems to be terrible from what I gather (huge horde dominance on Skeram it seems).
---
You‚Äôre right, he should have disclosed that before you made the run.  
---
So now, the next decision is if you want to leave the group if you don‚Äôt agree to the terms, not whine on Reddit.
---
inb4 character deleted. My friend is on whitemane and he's playing.
---
Sure. I mean, Wotlk had 4 times the subscribers as Vanilla, but that's just because it had more time, not because it was better! I mean, more people were able to get to max level and do the Raids, but that's a bad thing, they were all casual and didn't deserve to do those raids, they should have been farming quillboars in the barrens, you know, real gameplay. 
---
If in a year or two Classic is still stomping retail we can have a chat about it's superiority. Until then it's just a promotional sideshow.
---
Why would there be a queue without layering?  Answer:  there wouldn‚Äôt.  The same amount of people are logged into the server.
---
Am a lvl 48 Warrior in plate.  Repair costs for a death is maybe 10-30 silver, I think?

---
You should consider using Healbot, VuhDo, or mouse-over macros for your healing spells. That will leave all your normal keys available for dmg and utility spells. I find that using mouse clicks and shift/alt mouse clicks for heals is far more efficient.
---
Why didn't you go make that while the servers were down? 
---
You pay for the ability to access servers while they're up, there's no where stating you're obligated to get 24/7 access. Should we all get 32 day subscriptions because of the maintenance downtime? No.
---
thats rude
---
Are you successfully past character select?
---
yea ive been skinning but im at 200 leatherworking already so ive been using all the leather since i need to make the BiS stuff from ungoro eventually
---
Good meme, but on a sidenote: I take Underwaterbreathing over yet another Int Buff on my rogue.
---
&gt; you think you're the majority while being downvoted to hell
---
Do you have a special Reddit add-on that lets you see hidden comment scores?
---
Same issue.. prob not worth submitting a ticket.. I‚Äôd wait a bit
---
yep same here with white mane, other realms can log in just fine - can't log in to any char on whitemane
---
Yeah it only affects some characters? Idk I am not having the issue but its most likely related, if not it is a weird coincidence
---
So many good memories on MG.
---
Unable to connect to any realm after being kicked. None show offline though and someone else in my house is on fine. Anyone else?

Nah you were wrong chap, pipe down and accept your loss without endlessly moving the goalposts.

It‚Äôs another ddos attack. Go do some housework , take a shower, eat. You‚Äôve got time.
---
Good tanks can get away with a little bit of bullshit but that's ridiculous.
---
They're essentially asking to be paid to tank level relevant 5-mans. They can fuck off.

What server are you on?
---
Did your brain rot? Mine certainly would
---
Same, can't get past 80% of the laod bar on Whiteman.
---
The manufacturers of these IoT devices need to be held more liable for this crap.  Why does everything need to have an IP all of the sudden and no way to keep them regularly updated.
---
It‚Äôs that I got dced while in a loading screen so now I‚Äôm stuck in that loading screen.
---
Do I need to make this longer? Or is this just kinda not post worthy lol
---
Wow good job so special
---
It's not just wow they attacked, it's twitch and Wikipedia
---
Try getting invited to a different layer on a character you can log in with then switch back. This worked for me yesterday.
---
I think they probably raised the drop rate in 1.12.  I farmed this recipe all the time back in vanilla but could never get it.
---
Been selling all your greys/whites?
---
What class you playing?
---
Have you been selling stuff on the ah?
---
Here‚Äôs a punishment for the guy responsible:
---
Either he can spend the 9 years in prison or 
---
Level a war with zero gear, no help from other people and have his xp gained reduced by 80%
---
What are the best kiting classes? Also, can locks summon the doomguard and set him free still?
---
Yeah, I mean none of them are officers and they'll still group with me if I gquit.
---
lol, you don't have to be offended that we are laughing at your stupid comment
---
Seems like ddos is still occurring, I am getting world server downs messages.
---
Blizzard Twitter says they working on it.
---
-cheers
---
Why would you assume that? It's possible (probable?) that layers are separate physical servers, which would allow higher capacity since its split up.
---
He got 0 queue time when looking for a group. Thats worth a lot
---
My guild on biggles is called HELL YEAH BROTHER, our chat usually looks something like this at any given time

Lol, this is your first rodeo, isn't it?

Only download addons with the version 1.13

Funny you mention it, yes, that was the last thing I did was go to the grocery store lol
---
Hunter I play with created a macro that accurately does the fd/trap, it's totally possible

I'm level 11 and downloaded the game yesterday and I worked all day today lmao

What is this 2004 with low quality shitty phone pics?

do you accept Schrute Bucks
---
I fell off my flight path and had to exit game to stop rubber banding. Now I can't log in. Everyone else on my server seems fine. Sweet.

yeah, I was trying to hit 30 today hopefully it works out

Must have on the eu servers too, noggenfogger. Completed WC tried to leave instance, nothing, hearth stoned nothing (still got c/d) walked out of entrance nothing and left group finally to automatically get sent back still stuck.
---
It's about the journey. Getting a boe drop for you to use is immersive. Needing it to sell is the definition of greed.
---
Be like me, play for fun. Gold will come. I want to see my party members get better gear, not more gold.

He does send you to gather razormane bones though so maybe that's his payback?
---
Don't do either, save your gold.
---
Link me your PayPal, the laugh I got off this meme is well worth the 12 cents.
---
Blizzard is being attacked by ddosers. Its not you or your firewall most likely. Just gotta wait till things get fixed.
---
Lol, it's my second post in 2 years, IDAF about your internet points weirdo.  
---
Just wanted to give kudos to the classic community and it's great atmosphere right now.
---
Incorrect. The first roll also need to be higher than the 3rd guy's. This need to be taken inco account.
---
Lmao it's hilarious how oblivous so many of you are.
---
That's an instant /gquit and a message to your "friends" that they can message you anytime that want to have fun while playing a video game.
---
Yeah, most classes have a spec that could be more viable, via gear or trinket or talent. As long as they avoid creep towards homogenization like retail.
---
Lvl 37 and he‚Äôs buying greens from the AH, that mount is nowhere near his sight
---
Yes everybody needs it. Thats why ut is bot a valid reason for need. Use choose greed.
---
If everybody just need gold, everybody has chosen greed = equal chance to get the one thing evertbody that group needed...gold
---
While that technically works as a way to say it, I'm pretty sure it's color coded
---
It‚Äôs not the money, it‚Äôs the ideology behind it. Blizz is fucking up and should show some care to their customers that line their pockets
---
Save that staff and sell it in a few months (when battlegrounds come out). It‚Äôs BIS 19 healer weapon and can fetch a pretty penny (depending on server 50-100g - sometimes more)
---
Fuck, I love this quote. It's so powerful
---
sry
---
I hate to admit this, but some people actually feel they should be reimbursed for lost time. It‚Äôs pretty sad.
---
a free month lol
---
Exactly.  Layering works very well for those who are around the average level for the population.  For those who are higher than the curve, it's ridiculously sparse.  Great farming, though!
---
You used to be able to blink through it, you should give it a shot if you're playing a mage. The inside is just a big piece of flat brown land lol
---
Earned income is not the only way to measure utility. In a capitalist system, we measure utility with dollars. I'm not going to go into a whole lecture, but even if my $300 value was off (wasn't intended to be anyway), my time absolutely has more value than $0/hour any time I'm not working. There's an opportunity cost for any minute I'm not doing what I would have paid to be doing, or already paid to be doing, in this case.
---
Doesn‚Äôt the animation look/sound different?
---
In a good or bad way?

What's everyone's internet provider? I have AT&amp;T but it doesn't seem to be the issue since my IRL friend logged in just now and has them as well.

Earthfury here I come

BoE's are free for all. If you desperately want it, strike a deal with the guy who won it or farm the gold for it off of AH. A player can use the gold just as much as you can use the item (barring very few exceptions).
---
Well ya Amazon aws is massive.
---
I think it's childish and entitled because it's petty as hell.
---
You keep comparing it to an ISP, and if you work from home and could actually be financially impacted by an outage, you are in the clear.  But playing WoW is not financially impacting 99.99% of us.  And the dollar value of what you are asking for is just pocket change.
---
Again, if this were a serious service, you would have a point.  But to make such a fuss over something that is ultimately so minor really just makes you look like an 8 year old throwing a tantrum because he didn't get his gamey-game time.
---
If you're that stalled out, take the zep to undercity and go south to Tarren Mill; if thats too low keep heading east until you reach Arathi Highlands. 
---
No quest is too far.
---
Run RFC 3 times and you‚Äôll be kitted out

2. Pretty sure there are target dummies in Theramore
---
Kinda makes sense, seals cant breath underwater.
---
Not a huge deal if you don't get your mount right at 40, but if you can tolerate it, AOE grinding brings in decent money and tons of cloth which you can then sell for money. (Even vendoring it brings in decent money)

I've been playing way too much, lmao. I read your comment as 50 Copper.. haha!
---
I wasn't being serious tho.
---
MAGNUS RUSHES IN 
---
Oh wait wrong subreddit
---
For real, need to go there and make money
---
&gt;Everyone ‚Äúneeds‚Äù the gold
---
That is literally what the "greed" option mean.
---
The greed option is even a gold coin for fucks sake.
---
Need = This character needs this gear
---
Greed = alts need this gear / i can sell it
---
That is how it always was
---
Been trying to explain this to people.  If layering is dependant on the population, then Blizzard cannot say layering will end by the launch of Phase 2 if the population has not dwindled down enough to allow for it.  It's out of their hands; they have no control over it.  All they can do is delay Phase 2...which would be stupid af.
---
If whatever server group has the hardware to handle said # of connections (including those that are 'layered'), where the players are on the screen is irrelevant.
---
Bliz has shown how ridiculously fast you can flip between these different instances of a continent, likely all of the layers could be merged into one and performance would be a-ok.
---
You are objectively wrong, what you think doesn't matter. This isn't an opinion.
---
We all do :/
---
I miss that series
---
Play mage. good dps, always valued in raids and dungeons, pretty easy to play well enough, good utility like portals and conjured water.
---
I can join the server and get to the character screen...but I get stuck on the loading screen. Still can't get in. Really frustrating.
---
BOE upgrades ALWAYS go to who can equip and use it effectively. Anyone needing to sell is not worth a group invite.
---
&gt; my MM hunter was always top 3 dps in MC. When i completed my tier 1 set i was top dps a lot. And i'm not even a really good player.
---
all this means is the rest of your raid was absolute shit
---
Wow that's so funny. I remember when cata came out and I thought, "man theres going to be people who only know the new world and wont understand all the history." And here you are!
---
I'm glad classic came out to give you guys the full experience. Really makes retail questing so much better.
---
Ah man, been there.
---
Every zone has been beyond dead for me (Alliance Skeram). The old minor exception has been STV, in which there is a literal 1:5 ratio of alliance to horde. It‚Äôs bad.
---
Are you alliance or horde? Also don't forget to run dungeons they can help you fill a leveling gap and push you into that new zone
---
Want to min max? Engineering.
---
Want sustainable income? Herb/alc
---
Want to craft armors for your friends and yourself while leveling up with a few good pieces at end game? Go blacksmithing.
---
Just play at night, after 7pm that's when its bedtime for those ddos kids.
---
Thanks bud \^\^
---
i second the vuhdo rec although it can be difficult to initially set up (feel free to pm me w questions). i use the same system for every mmo. it isn‚Äôt perfect (in fact it may have met its match depending on how many down ranks i end up binding) but it has suited me very well across arena, mythics &amp; raiding (same thing in other games). 
---
~~ii won‚Äôt go all the way into it, since i doubt you‚Äôd want to copy my setup outright ~~ (editors note: i actually did go all the way into it) but i have 3 ‚Äúmain‚Äù bars of spells, grouped into 3 basic categories (staples, such as flash heal, renew &amp; pw:s; offensive abilities, pain, mind blast, your main cc spells (cyclone/root, paralyze/leg sweep, or scream/mind control here in classic (if i have a kick i usually bind that to the staples rather than offensive);  and defensives like pain sup (do we have that in vanilla?), bark skin etc). 
---
ANYWAY. the main point is that after the staple spells, which are bound to easily accessible letters and numbers (E, Q, T, C, B, V, Z, 1-5 maximum, no F keys, i have raccoon fingers), then i just repeat the same easy bindings with an added modifier. the reason i say this is that you already use shift ‚Äî so long story short, my suggestion would be to incorporate another one, either control or alt. supposedly you can do left shift, right alt, etc, but i‚Äôve never been able to figure out how to do it). 
---
hope this helps in some way. gl
---
We did it reddit!
---
Unfortunately we can only be that reckless once every 30 mins...
---
For their scales - but you‚Äôd be surprised how few scales Murlocs have

Godly
---
What level of Water and Food were you buying? And where is it most required?
---
Believe me, I feel everyone‚Äôs pain, but fuuuuck, I just wanna play lol
---
You made it weird
---
My back hurts just looking at this...
---
By the time you get your hunter to 60, you won't be a beginner anymore. Stick with the hunter man. And don't be afraid to look up guides if you ever feel like you are failing in some aspect of playing
---
Same. Still can't. It has been going on for about an hour.
---
he was specifically talking garbage about opportunity cost I‚Äôm not trying to weigh in on opinions here and this is basic economics of offsetting one activity against another I‚Äôm not trying to review his potential earnings
---
It seems like the herbs and minerals are grouped in smaller locations, so you swap layers and just look in the few spots you know they spawn.. They need to make it wayyyy more random
---
So... you mean playing Vanilla like it was originally?
---
Like the rest of this product was designed as.
---
&gt; Everyone will argue that it‚Äôs the part they personally like.
---
I laugh to much about this!
---
Our group managed to tag him and the rest of the people killed him :) sorry if you were there
---
I feel like those characters are just cheating at this point
---
Incredible insight! By removing value from the market by allowing the servers to be down, I was actually saved all that value and I should thank Blizzard by buying cosmetics on the retail store! Thanks for that PhD level of insight, I've seen the light!
---
This literally doesn't make any sense. If this is how you think, then everyone should ALWAYS be choosing Need, because everyone needs money and you can sell any of those items to the vendor.
---
If it's an upgrade and you're going to actually use it, then roll Need. If you're just going to sell it to the vendor or AH, then roll Greed. It's not that hard.
---
I'm no tech guy by any means but if you can just pay for a ddos service could you just pay one ddos service to ddos the other ddos service??
---
Typical etiquette (and this is just typical, by no means is it law lol) is if you have a rogue to unlock it it‚Äôs free roll, but if a blacksmith has a key to unlock it goes to the blacksmith since they‚Äôre mats they‚Äôre giving up to open it. Rogues can still make plenty money unlocking lock boxes indefinitely so don‚Äôt feel too bad on that one. Plus, if rogue really wanted to ninja it they could just say they don‚Äôt have the required skill and run back after group disbands and hearts out after runs complete
---
monkaW I actually have a smart lightbulb
---
it's responsible for this whole mess? hang on guys...
---
***grabs hammer***
---
Also Broken Tooth or the other pets with very fast attack speeds, they make casters cry.
---
&gt; So because they legally arent required to reimburse their players its ok to lose time paid for
---
Actually, yes.  As much as it sucks to admit, yes.  When you agree to the ToS for things like this, you are agreeing that 100% uptime isn't guaranteed.
---
Your followup restaurant analogy doesn't track, because you don't sign a waiver when you sit down to eat that you understand you might not get your food.
---
I say we take Bikini Bottom and push it somewhere else.
---
is thalnos up for anyone?
---
Is 1.13.02 the most recent? Found it odd 1.13 was higher on the list
---
Because of fear ward, yes.
---
Thank you for taking the time to explain it. WoW servers are huge targets because they affect a large amount of people. There are what 35 servers for Classic compared to the thousands for Fortnite and similar games. In other games people do DDOS but you don't hear about it because it's not interrupting hundreds of thousands of people, typically it is just the people within that match itself. To DDOS hundreds of thousands of people in Fortnite is an order of magnitude harder than it is in Classic. It is extremely hard for Blizzard to fight this type of attack.
---
!remindme 1 hour
---
I picked up skinning while levelling and just vendor all of it. It adds up. Especially if you find a place that had a beast kill quest and there are tons of dead mobs around others didn't skin.
---
Ok, Random reddit IT professional.
---
No, it's just a majority of the players are around the level that you would go there. According to the data censusplus classic has collected for horde on Herod, like half of the people are between 20 and 40
---
i mean.... not if you have a whole pack following you. Like... dogwalker style.
---
I was thinking of going as a "sustain" enh, ive seen some good coverage of it, any thoughts?
---
Hey there. Been online Deviate Delight for about an hour and a half now, no disconnects, if it helps. Every time I try to load my home server, Herod, I disconnect immediately. Looks like the problem is isolated between a few of the high population servers.
---
\#CFCPWgang
---
Yes, complaining about bad players you grouped with here will surely reach them and teach them the error of their ways.
---
It isn't a blizzard issue, read up on how these attacks work before talking please.
---
Who is complaining?
---
MICHAEL!

Hi Bebbit!

Careful, he‚Äôs a hero
---
&gt; I just got caught bullshitting here‚Äôs more bullshit
---
It takes a long time to get to difficult dungeons and raids. Plenty of time to hone your craft. If you like hunter stick with it. No class is really that difficult to be viable with
---
Make sure to contact a gm to get those back
---
I recommend you stay on retail before starting classic. Nobody will accept someone with such a shitty attitude. Just a heads up
---
Dont worry, they usually get caught and sent to 5 years in prison
---
Gratz on the mount, amazing guild name for an orc btw
---
technically they could be using 100gbps internet circuits at their data center and have beefier load balancers. but that cost is insanely high.
---
unfortunately the public internet runs on ethernet which will always have vulnerabilities for this type of attack.
---
I'm a level 14 Gnome Warlock. I've heard a bit about learning to use different weapons but I haven't been able to find if certain types are recommended. I was thinking about training staves. Is it really necessary at all or should I just stick with a wand and dagger?
---
are you doing it on enemies that drop xp?
---
Nice the community just got better
---
Oh, it's hard to tell when people aren't being serious on this subreddit lol
---
Im getting in to character select and then it says character not found :/ assuming this is from the attack.
---
Don't get too caught up in the AH early in the game.  Everybody is going through the levels at the same time and the AH can easily get saturated with similar items.  Plus, it's an immature market, so it's much more volatile.  
---
Later on, the market will stabilize and it'll be easier to sell stuff, but until then you might get disappointed by the AH.  Of course, you might get lucky and sell something for 1000% what it's worth, but I wouldn't count on it.  
---
These early weeks, it's probably better to vendor boe items you would otherwise put on the AH, I know it sucks to think of money you "might be missing out on", but if you post it 2 or 3 times with no takers, you lost the vendor value anyways.  
---
Keep trekin though, later on the market will stabilize and it'll be easier to sell stuff, I'd recommend leather, fishing and cooking.  Alchemists love fish.
---
Me that kind of orc
---
Ah yes, let‚Äôs throw away this kid in a cell.  That will reform them.  They can‚Äôt possibly be suffering mental health-wise.  Nah, fuck em.  They got in the way of my digital heroin addiction.  I hope they DIE IN PRISON!
---
-this sub
---
Just saying, numbers don't tell the full story and that's the exact mistake the current retail devs are making - which the OP is making in turn.
---
I had a similar experience but I tried to jump on behind the ropes. I didnt make it but I clipped onto an edge on the side of the zeppelin and safe  ghost ride that night into UC
---
Nope just tried
---
More letter posts, and more and more.
---
When will this meta end
---
&gt;Not always feesible, and we don't know how the server architecture functions, may not be compatible with cloud computing.
---
Huh? Any public-facing traffic can leverage most cloud providers' load balancers. Even external datacenters, with proper routing.
---
It's really odd that yesterday every server was intermittent during the ddos attack. Now all the servers were up shortly after except 5 which won't work at all.
---
Around major cities, or around the area of the dungeon. Most people use the General, trade or LFG chat for that
---
Totally agreing with you. Off topic, what was the last expansion where aggro management really mattered?
---
I got him, just want best passives for him! I get Frost and Shadow, I just don't know what to do with the remaining training points.
---
I'm not sure how they handle the leftover tbh, if it's like you say then it should be possible to log on in STV and have almost no people around? I've never seen known activity hubs appear empty so far, so maybe they have some solution to it.
---
Dang, you're right. I forgot that monetary value is directly tied to the earners emotional state. I guess I have no choice but to concede my argument. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Stupid? Really? I fucking WISH that most people were as braindead as you are. Then I could freely roll need on anything extremely valuable while the mouth-breathers like you sit on your high horse and pass it on to me.
---
I‚Äôm so Myzrable!! ;(
---
The client‚Äôs lap, obviously.
---
Man you are such a hypocrite, it‚Äôs hilarious. Do you not see that the one raging is you? Do you really lack self awareness to that degree? You are a joke
---
I'd suggest looking up level ranges of zones. Usually there should be another zone where you can atleast do green quests. Otherwise I'd suggest running skinning and find a place with a bunch of beasts to grind it out whilst skinning them to vendor some extra coins.
---

LEEROYYY

Hes from the UK
---
Maybe.  But we also don't really hear about all the times outside entities attacked and failed to make an impact, either.  This could be like a one-in-ten thousand case, for all we know.
---
Typical horde response.
---
whats the point of fishing?
---
Also recommend equipping a wand and getting use to shooting it.
---
Maybe for YOU.
---
Sounds like it's just your server. On Atiesh, every zone is a constant flow of LFG and shitposting.
---
Sweetie pie you don't roll need on BoP drops because they vendor for small amounts of gold, but everyone should roll need on BoE drops because they sell on the auction house for very lots amounts of gold.
---
There is a little difference here! I need 250g, I don't really need 5g. Have fun rolling greed on extremely valuable items while intelligent and well-adjusted human beings roll need on them without a second thought. 
---
You can spend a few minutes ranting like a mouth breathing pedant to them about the difference between two fucking buttons in a virtual world and they'll just kick/ignore you.
---
Yeah, I get what you're saying now, but you started off by saying "1/10,000 to tie the first roll" which isn't correct and what I was trying to fix. Your math is still correct if you're specifically talking about tying on a 100.
---
People always use general chat on my server.
---
Launcher says it has something to do with ISPs, so maybe ISPs and the servers are related?
---
Herod still shows Low Pop, which is obviously insane. Same with Thalnos and Heartseeker. Every other server is Medium/High/Full; only 4-5 including the ones I listed appear to be affected/register as low pop.
---
They do still have the zeppelins though.
---
Dumb person thinks he's much smarter than he is.I see it every day across the internet.  A predictable trait among the basement dwelling losers.
---
Maaan, it strange.. I was against classic, to be honest. Yet i started, just to see and.. After 40h and lvl 25 rogue i am not stopping.. The community, the feeling, quests you want to do, dungeons, making gold.. Thank you! I have forgotten that feeling. Actually the last time i felt this was in Cata, but i was a holy pala then and with some crazy nice guild. Enjoy and maybe, maybe 9.0 can bring some of it to my pala.
---
Well for the whole server but goodluck out there!
---
Priest is working well for me. I can take on mobs that are 3-5 levels higher than my level currently and there‚Äôs little to no downtime between fights. Great for solo leveling and easy to find groups.
---
According to TSM I have purchased 143 Linen Bags, 1 Blue, 3 Red, 3 Green, and 1 Black pouches.
---
UNDER Vendor price on the AH.  
---
If you spend some time, they will show up eventually.
---
I've also had some 8 and 10 slots, even got a 12 slot Large Knapsack for 2 silver.
---
It's fine now
---
But they are in all heirlooms
---
How do you have that silver dragon on your ui?
---
Why are Chinese playing on Whitemane?
---
Sure, if you can find them.
---
Probably better to just call it a night and find something else to do that stress over this.
---
They owe us the moment we pay for their services and they don't deliver. That's how business works. 
---
Also, I'm just playing devil's advocate here
---
Did somebody say....
---
Excellent.
---
were you in/around stormwind when you got DC'd?
---
I had to GM ticket move my character to be able to log in, the skies around the area are full of gryphons from people hitting the region border and crashing out.
---
That's the Vanilla experience right there!  When you get stomped so many times that you no longer feel any empathy for the other faction and you just kill on sight!
---
Nah, that was Obama‚Äôs specialty. Trump‚Äôs specialty is just memeing his foes to death and showing the world what a dipshit hypocrite they are...
---
... or Tomahawks (I‚Äôm looking at you, Syria).
---
Ah so he's prosecuting him for wrong thought.
---
Yes they do
---
I hung up some pictures that've needed hanging for a while, gave the dog a bath, cleaned my desk some... there's a bunch of games I could play instead, but all I want is classic, and if I can't play that then... I'll be responsible?
---
LOOOOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLOLLL
---
maybe they meant from 59?
---
Idgaf if you're undead, you buffed me so dammit, you're getting something back!
---
Better copy and paste that statement for the flood of stupid posts coming in.
---
Herod is down. Some of my friends are on but I keep dropping.
---
Thats why I rushed to 55 on my hunter and spent this whole morning skinning devilsaurs. I now got enough leather for my set + a few to sell, now I can take all the time I want for everything else. Feels good having this done before the zerg is anywhere close.
---
Better question, why is a Chinese guild on a US server?
---
Pretty sure it's phase 4
---
I recommend an alt. A hybrid class is always good, like shaman, paladin, or druid. Otherwise a hunter is extremely strong and versatile
---
ya im locked out as well XD
---
Faerlina was DDoS'd prior to maintenance earlier today.
---
If a server has 10K players and 5 layers of 2,000 people with a max of 120 black lotus per day that means the max is now 600 black lotus per day since we actually have 5 servers worth of gathering mats.
---
There was a MAX amount of certain items that could be gathered per day and now that is raised by the amount of layers. There's a reason you constantly see people asking for an invite to layer hop.
---
Layering will destroy any economy that we could have had. We won't see it until layering is removed and people have tens of thousands of very had to gather items like black lotus and arcane crystals.
---
I can't get on Myzrael either.
---
Lol, you're definitely not wrong. I always wonder if anyone happens to even read other threads on here before making a post.
---
Hamstring and cheese it
---
I do this every time rn. It is a sign of trust to expose meself like that... Yet also every time I am holding my finger on that vanish button for if the person decides to betray my "trust", I will show him why I level in Subtlety
---
I've met *one* bad person so far who actually wiped us by doing dumb shit on purpose and that is in 3years of pservers and now classic. You are wildly exaggerating the amount of bad people in vanilla/classic.
---
Why should I use heal, when I just could use greater heal for 70 mana more at lvl 40 ?
---
it‚Äôs almost intentionally making yourself worse using 2H, fury is viable with a shield though
---
You literally said there are "no more physical servers". That's not even possible.
---
My login bar keeps going further up, if I get desperate enough I‚Äôll just make another toon on another realm üòï
---
Man, why does Fortitude cost so much mana. Just got the 700 mana one and that‚Äôs like 1/3rd if my total mana.
---
Every nvidia user got shadowplayüòâ
---
But those are known, 15 years.. I have farmed them for awhile, selling enchants to twinks in numerous expansions..
---
They were okayish with arcane missiles +explosion and a fire ward
---
My thought exactly. Don't let the terrorists win!
---
Sure, 16 hours a day on wow and 8 hours sleeping, every day, for 13.... days..
---
My point is, they still have to have man power on standby, regardless of what or whose issue it is. It is ultimately still effecting Blizzard. And who knows what potential peripheral issues could arise as a result of outside issues, especially coming off the heels of yesterday's issues.  So go fuck yourself please.
---
woah haven‚Äôt heard about this
---
You are absolutely raging uncontrollably right now. I can fucking smell how sweaty you are getting. Fucking relax, "need" and "greed" are fucking buttons in a virtual world. It is a video game sweetie, they don't actually mean what you think they do.
---
OOTS!
---
You don't say...
---
To be honest in Raids too, just not during progress and not until Phase 4, but duelwielding.
---
So the FB Oi
---
In Resistance fights (where everyone has to bust out Fire, Shadow or Nature resist sets) it can work, because Armor and your shield do not protect you during those encounters.
---
In a normal encounters though, unless you are overgeared/skilled for the content, using Shield Block to push Crushing Blows off the hit table is too important.
---
It's think its TBD since Parry values on private servers were too low. That and it's definitely dual wield since the whole point is to TPS as high as possible, so in that regard he is incorrect.
---
I‚Äôm not home, so it‚Äôs entirely possible that it can also be on the ISP side, I just find that difficult to follow because i assume all the servers would be in the same or adjacent cabinets, so only having select servers would be odd to me
---
Wasted 30 min zoning for a Ulda run... :(
---
Plz correct my math senpai
---
Forgive me friend, your downvote only adds to my failure!
---
It's mostly just fuel for cooking, but there are some fish used in alchemy and rare item drops like maces with a fish appearance, or rings.
---
IMO on rare epics and other random valuable drops the best course of action is for everyone to just roll need. 4 guys to roll greed for 1 guy to hit need is just too risky. Some items in classic are damn near once in a lifetime and I‚Äôm going to give myself a chance to win them if I was in the group helping kill mobs. If you need that recipe go buy it. If we did this with all items it would even out in the end. Greens and level 59 and under items I don‚Äôt really care but anything worth 25+ I‚Äôm rolling need. Cause nothing guarantees the guy who wins it doesn‚Äôt sell it himself. (He/she probably will)
---
Especially when you expect basically no updates and no new content, and you could not possibly give a shit less about Retail.  We're paying very good money for what Blizzard is expected to deliver here.
---
Even with layering high pop is miserable. Was in STV yesterday on Herod and there are more players than mobs. Doing any sort of drop quest  or even just attempting to grind for XP is just fucked. We're talking like 15k XP an hour at lvl 40 if you tried to lvl there.
---
Because most zeppelins are replaced by portals, so most travel can be done by a click of the button. Travel is an instant thing in retail wow, not an adventure like in classic.
---
Who‚Äôs offering the bounty?
---
I don‚Äôt think I ever went to Desolace in Vanilla. The place reminds me so much of Hellfire Peninsula.
---
What‚Äôs the difference between 100 servers and 25 servers with 4 layers each?
---
*No.*
---
Possible, highly unlikely though between heirlooms, sharding, low populations, lack of world content, triviality of leveling, emphasis on only 120 endgame.
---
Dude it‚Äôs been going on for a few hours now just sort by new and you‚Äôd have seen the hundreds of posts you‚Äôve just added to about it
---
How bout that Darkmans tho
---
Seeing as how monetary value is simply the concrete means being used to measure a person's subjective utility in this case, you are right that not considering sacrifice, expectation, or alterations made to reserve free time in your assessment means your measure is inaccurate and incomplete. Your time is worth more than what you generate in GDP for the country.
---
Please don‚Äôt.  We‚Äôre already over capacity at the weekly altoholic‚Äôs anonynous meetings.
---
It's a lot simpler than I thought. I have two, like I said, they are literally just:
---
    /equip &lt;1h weapon name&gt;
---
    /equip &lt;shield name&gt;
---
and, obviously
---
    /equip &lt;2h weapon name&gt;
---
You have to change it each time you get a new weapon or shield, but I haven't found it to be problematic and you can just Shift+Click the item in your bag to type it out. There are other, fancier ones out there that rely on bag slot and what not I think, but this is easy and works.
---
It's really sad how badly you want me to be "mad."
---
"Raging uncontrollably"?  Lol really?  A tad dramatic, don't you think?  
---
If you are smelling sweat you should probably throw on some deodorant.
---
I just understand what the buttons mean... I'm sorry if you don't.
---
Yup, now I can't log onto any server.
---
Herod is having the same issues. I assume any of the servers that say they have a low population right now are affected.
---
At least mages get the 6% hit chance in the first row of the frost tree. Those were the first 3 points I spent even though I was playing as a fire mage, 100% worth it.
---
&gt;*I've seen people selling hundreds of black lotus in chat..*
---
Have you seen the Black Lotuses though?
---
I can spam "Thunderfury for sale, 5k gold" in trade chat. That doesn't mean I have a Thunderfury for sale...
---
People know others (such as yourself) are getting riled up about a perceived layering problem and as such can resort to trolling in trade...
---

I WORK FULL FUCKING TIME AND GO TO SCHOOL FULL FUCKING TIME.

YOUR *INSOLENCE* KNOWS NO BOUNDS. YOUR SOUL WILL BE FLAYED UPON THE ROCKS OF HADES FOR ALL ETERNITY. THE SCREAMS OF YOUR MOTHER SHALL ECHO IN THE MINDS OF YOUR CHILDREN FOR GENERATIONS, WHILE THEY WANDER THE EARTH WONDERING WHY THEY ARE DAMNED.

This happened to me in WC used hearth stone and it still brought me back to the dungeon and a C/d on my hs.

If you want to help them out, you could follow them around while not grouped with them, killing mobs they tag to help them level up much faster. That might get a little boring though, so you could just level an alt with them as well. If they're a priest and a hunter maybe a melee class would be good to balance out the trio
---
Yeah, I just wanna log in and do something at this point
---
Please Karen. Just the hang the fuck up if you here a dial tone then. DIALS TONES ARE NOT PEOPLE KAREN.

REEEEEEE!! (screeches) (I really want to fucking play fucccck)

The Barrens in Thalnos general chat is wack, people spamming LFG and constant jerk talk going on
---
Myzrael has been down for over an hour now. Guess I don't get to play this weekend =(.
---
I mean, Priest wanding damage deals more dps than what many other "non-supportive" classes are capable of, especially earlier on in the leveling process.
---
I can only play on the weekends.  Is there any way for me to get a refund for my monthly subscription?  I‚Äôve literally lost 25% of my time to play this month because of the outages.

I‚Äôm using Inventorian . Now how one bag üíº instead of four 6 slot bags.

To the reddit mathematicians:

What are the odds of 3 people rolling the same numbers twice in a row?

Asking just out of curiosity.
---
They have to give xp or honor, so no grey mobs.
---
If that's the case, are you casting it too late?  Sometimes when I cast right before they die, it doesn't register and doesn't give me a shard.
---
For strong off spec use priest, but that‚Äôll get expensive. You can only have 1 spec and respeccing is not cheap
---
Everytime I choose a server after logging in, I immediately get disconnected. I can login fine on my other pc though.

Started playing wow 3 months ago 
---
The community is rough . No communication in the world at all .

But I‚Äôve started as a tank . I didn‚Äôt know a lot about tanking in wow . When I said It was the first time i ran a dungeon they didn‚Äôt kick me . The only  time i was kicked was during my first time walking dungeon I ran .

Had a 1 hour conversation during a dungeon because the healer left before the final boss and we waited for the queue .

Why would china not extradite someone? Blizzard has a presence there and there is no upside to protecting someone so insignificant.
---
The best way to grind gold in this game is to level. The AH is essentially "dead" at the moment, you get most of your gold from leveling. The value of those items increases as you level.
---
I'm pretty sure race does not lock you out of any quest, save maybe priest.

For a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) to work you need thousands of requests to a site simultaneously. You do this by having bots do this for you, which all have different independent identifiers. Someone pays for access (C&amp;C Server) to a certain number of these bots (IoT botnet) to do their bidding. Some of these bots are spies (honeypots), as in placed intentionally as a bot waiting to be used in these nefarious activities so they can tell the cops who requested these services and what they are doing. 
---
Once someone uses multiple spies they can then trace it back to when someone requested them to do work. Then trace it back to who requested them. Then trace it back to who payed for the request.

I have a 20 warrior that has skinning and mining for professions. I want to do blacksmithing eventually for the armour I can craft for my warrior but was planning on levelling up mining up to a point where I can actually get the materials to make viable gear. I also think keeping skinning for now is making decent money, when should I drop skinning for blacksmithing?
---
also, so why does calling the pizza company effect the people going INTO the pizza place to buy pizza, like usual (us)

I've got a lv 28 orc warrior on a server that's like 75%+ alliance. I'm feeling like I should switch servers because the population just feels so weird. It's kind of difficult forming groups and the auction house feels slow sometimes.

Entitled to quest kills are we? If you wipe him with your party, then all bets are off and he's morally clean to utilize every tool at his disposal to wipe you as well :)

It'll still piss him off, not being able to play.  Even if he makes a ton of subs because of it.  I would imagine no matter what happens, he'll remain a successful wow streamer, and he's honestly probably very well off by this point.
---
The viewership is easily explained too; a bunch of people who can't play will instead tune into streams in the meantime, hoping the problem gets fixed fast.  You don't have to be a faerlina player to want to watch asmongold either.

You're right. It's just a blanket statement.
---
I‚Äôm using Inventorian
---
TOLD
---
in pve your job is to do shitty dps and keep shadow weaving on the boss and when you're close to oom, you wand and use rank 1 shadow word: pain
---
raids will also only take 1 shadow priest per group or they're shitty, spriest dps is overall really low. you can't even throw VT out because it takes up a debuff slot so pve spriest dps is a debuff bot and nothing more
---
in pvp, they're good, i'd roll with [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/500132133--0502322103511251) 
---
if you try to have a single spec for both you're gonna gimp yourself in one or the other so i'd avoid it, find a guild that raids in back to back days early or late in the week and you can just swap specs once per week and that's completely doable.
---
you don't have to worry about threat in pve either, your damage output won't be high enough and you still have fade. 
---
i wouldn't try a one spec fits all approach or i'd just raid in my pvp spec which is the best compromise

90% will be solo or dungeons? Go hunter. Raid-wide hunters fall off, but you shouldm't compare a hunter to a warrior and only look at numbers, then you might as well just go warr. Look at unique utility you bring, compare yourself to other hunters, and pls uncheck growl when entering dungeons.
---
Uhhh sure

But ppl in the city need pvp on right?

I reserved my IRL NAME (Gregor) when it was launched, just for the sake of it, yesterday i saw a Greggor in the wild, poor soul
---
Yeah, I noticed! I even got help by a lvl 20 mage, but even that wasn't enough, the escort guy was squishy as f*ck.
---
Okay. Doesn't make it any less true.

10 silver per death. Death is 10% durability... 1g for red gear is appropriate. 3g if 30s...

Damnit herod is my server
---
Leatrix plus
---
Well, at least I wont have to fight the queue when I get off work.
---
Awesome dude! It didn't work for some people which sucks but if it helps some of you that's great.
---
the games class design is not hyper balanced to the point where every class can do everything, so I‚Äôd recommend playing all the classes that look interesting and find one with the tools and abilities you enjoy.

download the badboy spam blocker addon

Because they can juggle their health and mana resources extremely easily leading to little to no downtime, on top of having voidwalker and innately great survivability themselves via draintanking, DoT kiting etc.
---
Herod says offline now.
---
O man thank you, you just made my day! I work as a graphic designer üòÉ
---
I'm also not entirely sure how it works, but this is how it seems from my experience. I often log in late evening or at night, and even when the zone I quest in displays 50+ players with /who, it often feels like I'm playing with 6 people. There's noone in any of the quest locations and a few people at best in the main town, despite what /who tells me. So I thought that I'm just always inserted into the 'last' layer which has only a few leftover players in it.
---
I may well be wrong, but the game feels a lot less populated than I'd hoped it would, and I suspect layering is the cause of that.
---
1st is the hunter becuase of pet second is lock because of slightly weaker pet.
---
&gt; the games class design is not hyper balanced to the point where every class can do everything
---
Every class has a unique identity, as such every class has its own spot in the raid, with some having more than others.
---
As for spec choices, may be sadly informed that most specs aren't that terribly effective!
---
So as others have asked, you want to deal damage? Warlock/Mage are really interesting/fun. Want to tank? Warrior (be ready for PAIN!). Heal? Try a priest/shaman/paladin. Want to roam around the world and explore? Hunter. Want to be the swis army knife for your friends? Druid. (Be warned druid has a painful learning curve)
---
It now says Herod is "offline"

---
I cant get on to see what exactly I havent learned but from what I can remember its scorch, flamestrike, amp magic, detect magic (someshit like that), might be a few more but those are the ones I can remember off the top of my head. Some spells are less used like the wards but can be VERY useful at times. 
---
Just get rich and buy all the spells. That the way I do it.
---
I think first time is 3hr ban. While i cant condone using that word imo the ganking and trolling  is a serious problem and if it was handled better these things would not happen.
---
Those wernt supposed to be metaphors for anything specific, i'm just trying to say surely a company as large as blizzard can overcome the challenge of a few kids attacking their servers. Amazon can, google can, etc. And for "theyre only a gaming company", valve can (they have made it a point to put in huge infrastructure to protect their servers).
---
He be da wrong faction, mon

"What was the first MMORPG" is a topic where opinions are meaningless. Only facts matter. And the fact is that the only person up above who came even remotely close to being factual is the one who said Ultima Online.

Why would you get a refund when something is down for a fraction of the time you paid for it? Literally, even if it was down for an ENTIRE 2 DAY PERIOD, that would only equal $1 of your $15 monthly subscription.
---
And kidney missing
---
Oh man I‚Äôm sad I missed it!
---
I decided to finally play my alt on Faerlina, however that also isn't working. Herod just went offline, so perhaps they're restarting it. DDoS has been preventing many people from playing the last few hours
---
That is happening with high tier stuff like lotus, thorium, salmon etc. OP is in the copper age essentially. Sure he can fish early on but what's the demand for consumables at this point? You can count MC clears on one hand at this point, and any additional raiding that was going to happen this weekend never did. He can buy stacks of copper bars for just one stack of grey items at the moment, that's how cheap everything is (on Herod for reference). I think leveling is more important, so he can get to the tier to farm as you mentioned.
---
Same issue, and a friend of mine as well. Both playing on linux with lutris, could it be linked?
---
That was pretty much my question?
---
if you have the element of surprise, it's ok to try to treat it similarly to pve. I.E. open with Holy Fire-&gt;Mind Blast. Good players will notice you've put them in combat though so may be tricky to get this all off and stick with them if they're not fighting a mob (but we're not really great at chasing someone who wants to run and sees us coming anyway, so it's worth a shot in my book...). At this point they're running or coming at you so stick with them/strafe away from melee and stack sw:p + devouring plague if undead. Stay with them and reapply sw:p till dead if they're running, fear+mind flay/shield/heal self/wand as needed if they're fighting.
---
That's a gist of it but you need to adjust to the fight. 
---
Priest v priest mana burn is your friend.
---
New to classic wow, can anyone direct me on how to get involved in world pvp?
---
Actually i didnt. I did most of the quests and many of the rest are too difficult to do as a solo warrior. Considering it takes me approx 3-4 hours per solo level, i certainly got more questing experience
---
Shout out Smegmage for making me spit out my coffee

He was super drunk when he saw it and still kept denying it
---
Most underrated comment!
---
well thats better than usual..
---
I don't have specifics but I had this conversation and posed the same question to my IT friend. He mentioned that there would still be a check of some kind that the server does on you when you attempt to connect. So when a fake person from the DDOS attack connects it would go through the same check you do as a paid player. It would then determine if your account is active etc after that check.
---
Me too!
---
Uber brought us to this!
---
Genius!
---
As said again how many people you think will really be doing this, I would say maybe .01% of guilds will be efficient enough to do this kind of stuff esp with a much less p server player presence will be WAY more casual raiding guilds than serious. It's not something to encourage new players to do.
---
Same, first the long ass queues and now this lol.

Wikipedia says about Pantheon:  " At [PAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAX_(event)) East 2018, it was announced that Pantheon would be in alpha by the end of the year. However, in August 2018, Visionary Realms walked back that claim, saying alpha would be delayed in order to bring the game closer to "launch-quality in art and polish. "  
---
And that's the last word.  So... is it still in alpha?  This game has been hyped for a while and it's still in alpha?  If that's true it's looking more and more like people will be lucky to ever even see a release.
---
Yeah, and that guy who cut me off yesterday and made me miss my light should get 2 minutes jail time!
---
Why do you feel entitled to free loot that would be good for everyone?
---
I'm obviously speaking about the definition of greed in terms of the system, as it's the only definition relevant to the discussion. In the "need before greed" system, gear upgrades are need, and gold value is greed. 
---
That's why the greed thing is literally a gold coin. Idk where you got the idea that after a certain gold value, the coin somehow outvalues the value of a gear upgrade.
---
That's a selfish and isolationist mentality carried over from BFA that prioritizes individual progression over others. 
---
At the end of the day, idc what your opinion is, if you're in my groups, you'll play by the rules I set because i'll be tanking and leading the group.
---
Might be on booty bay AH, but probably extremely overpriced
---
Why name it Christianity anyway?
---
I feel that casters should rely more on distance and space than on pets for damage mitigation.  It's fine to pull threat off your pet, especially if it's dying. 
---
At level 13, get a wand (greater magic wand), dot stuff up, and wand it. While you get other abilities that come into their own later, you really want to just efficiently kill stuff before it can do significant damage to you or your pet.
---
So general immaturity and selfishness. The emotional equivalent of a spoiled toddler.
---
Not at all, this has been a debate before WoW even existed.
---
is ok i resolved the issue we can now play

Did you call off specifically to play WoW?

It's back up... for now.
---
Shouldn't really need to spend money to upgrade your weapon to be honest, if you need a weapon upgrade, do a dungeon and target ones that have weapon upgrades. I would say about every 10 levels or so, start looking towards a new weapon, but you can go even 20 levels without one easily.
---
I was thinking of something similar to that, so I deleted my cache, still didn't work. I uninstalled regular WoW, classic, and the PTR, and I'm still having the same issue. Atleast classic is only a 4gb download =)
---
oh hell yeah dude thank you!!! what the hell is ipv6 anyway?
---
&gt; there is no way to 100% prevent them from doing that without filtering ALL traffic which creates a constantly worse overall experience. 
---
why would that be negative?
---
Rip weekend
---
I have never played this game before, always been a Runescape guy. Considering they just released the nostalgic WoW (I would believe), do I really need to pay money to play it? (Was looking forward to trying this, but maybe not I suppose.)
---
You're wrong here - when herod and other servers were at their worst, blizzard openly stated they would increase layers to the server allowing them to increase capacity. They max out how many people per layer so it is relevant.

You should add Thalnos to that list. It's frustrating since I've invested quite some time of my little time on my lvl 25 character. I can get to other servers but I just want my character. I hope that they can let us move these characters to other servers that we want because I don't want to level another 25 again :/
---
You have made good life choices, Bro.
---
Yeah he doesn‚Äôt understand. He‚Äôs only ever played retail and only after cata
---
All it is doing is adding a timer to the dungeon run. Makes it much more tricky and less forgiving, I definitely dont think it's a design flaw
---
It's 'should have', never 'should of'.
---
Rejoice, for you have been blessed by CouldWouldShouldBot!
---
Anyone on Herod in game??? It seems like Herod is one of the targeted realms
---
From memory?? Holy shit you are talented.
---
Find a better guild, it makes all the difference in the world.
---
Look for a leveling guild, friendly to new players, they will help you and teach you along the way.
---
What does twink and Boe mean? I keep seeing these terms everywhere
---
alright thanks yeah was thinking id be gimping myself as well. I just was unsure of how important maxing  imp mind blast  and shadow dmg resist was. Everything seemed straight forward to me but  I felt like my build did have to many points thanks for your input
---
Playing from day to day is miniscule gains. It's when you can't get online for a weekend you truly miss out.
---
Afaik it is 55/45 for alliance.
---
I‚Äôm with you on that :)
---
For real, if losing a video game makes you start throwing racial slurs then you need to re-evaluate playing online games.
---
Anyone sitting spamming trade lfg is in a major city, not questing or fighting mobs, so yes it does mean everyone does that. 
---
The only "productive" thing you could be doing while spamming trade to LFG is level your professions or sell some shit, which is hard to do in trade chat because of all the LFG spam.
---
Yep basically ^_^
---
Level up faster than him and then go back and carry him
---
That would be like a hitman going to the cops to report the person who hired him after he already killed the guy.
---
they're 5s from vendors lol
---
but they could have simply just raised capacity without raising layers. they specifically raised layers so they dont overcrowd zones with higher capacity per layer/server. they max out the people per layer **due to overcrowding**.
---
You can start with PW:S/renew against this boss, but he does hit like a truck and your tank was too low. While the healer can be slightly lower lv. than the instance, it's good for the tank to be slightly higher.
---
So for ex., I would say WC is typically 18-20, but priest 17-20 (maybe even 16-20), tank 19-21.
---
But he is generally amongst the hardest hitting for the level bosses in the lower half of the game.
---
Here I guess!  Server?  Alliance/Horde?
---
Okay so you can do that when that nice 150g twink item drops and then it gets ninja'd.
---
Why would you ever do that to yourself.
---
Just everyone roll need like smart people do and if you win the item you can absolutely sacrifice the 150g you'd get and give it to the guy to use for 3 levels.
---
Just bought the game yesterday after thinking it over for a while. Haven't played WoW for probably 9 years now. 
---
What's the plan with Classic WoW after it's been out for a while? Will they be adding anything else? Has this even been addressed by Blizzard? I can't imagine 5 years from now that Classic WoW will still be exactly the same as it is today.
---
It's the latter. Enter combat, delete your enemy.
---
Yep. A priest rolled on my Scarlet Boots because they *need* the gold.
---
So then after they happened the group also *needed* another tank, because fuck people like that. If you even come close to that mentality get that fuck back in BfA. Classic is for community.
---
I don't think the armchair IT guys understand how many B2B services are available to mitigate these attacks - even for in-house datacenters.
---
Or they're stubborn vets with their heads' in the sand, seething anytime the word "cloud" is mentioned.
---
1-6, Shift 1-4, Ctrl 1-3, E, Shift-E, F, Shift-F, G, Shift-G, Shift-S, Alt-1-2. That's at Level 50 on an efficient Warrior. Ya memes weak, boi.
---
Go hiking, I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs plenty of flight paths you haven‚Äôt grabbed yet.
---
Sounds like you are too impatient.  At 15 you rerolled because no one needed a healer?  That goes back and forth.  Everyone looking for a tank.  20 min later everyone looking for a healer.  You try for 5 minutes and just bounce?  Sit in lfg... it's global so you can see people lfg and continue questing or start your own group.  Roll a mage and learn the game.  You will get groups as any class if you are patient or make your own.  Join a guild make friends run stuff.   Mage is simple where you can't mess up too much and people don't have to rely on you as much.  Telling people you have no idea how to tank is like saying, "this might take an hour or two longer than it should".  Just get on the and play.   Someone looking for tank... say I can tank.  Shout and sunder away.
---
I want to level a priest, i am debating whether to level on a pve or pvp server. Will i get griefed to hell if i plan on questing alone?
---
So op, what happened? Did he slaughter them all? Did he die a heroes death? Did you guys escape into the sunset together? Don‚Äôt leave us hanging!
---
Should never censor the name for stuff like this. People deserve to know so we can avoid him.
---
Give us any sort of idea besides the obvious.
---
High five
---
Holy cow I loved every moment of this. My favorite part was the drawing of you wiping out the mob. Did you do the sound effects for that yourself? Also loved all the small details like the E for Edgy at the start.  You've earned a subscriber.
---
Take the boat to Menthil Harbor and then literally just run down the coast and come in at the beach in the corner of Westfall. There are no mobs at all until you hit the beach. It takes a good 20-30 minutes but it's by far the safest way to get there.
---
Shamans could dual wield in tbc but not vanilla, and the level 10 thing is for retail shamans
---
at least thats what it should have been like if it wasent for layers
---
It's a huge trek, you have to take the boat from darkshore to menethil harbor and then run all the way through the wetlands to dun morogh and then take the tram from ironforge to stormwind. alternatively you can take this little shortcut where you jump off the boat once it gets to the harbor, swim to a particular spot, drown, and then spirit rez in dun morogh https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7Dr2ft7xYY
---
I still can't login. Are you guys still having this issue?
---
what do you mean dead silent? it comes out this year and its just a remaster. what are you expecting them to say about it?
---
Like what? What do you want them to say
---
I started playing classic with some friends, but they've been slacking, so now I'm a 33 warrior who's questing mainly solo.
---
We are on incendious pvp server, but as a warrior, I'm finding myself getting frustrated with the lack of flexibility in the class. I don't necessarily want to server change, but I guess my question is this..
---
Everywhere I'm questing now is contested territory. Are most of my quests and levels going to continue to the in contested territory, or are there horde controlled areas I can focus on?
---
Hmm strange, theres an npc in the game called Zanzil the outcast
---
Whats his twitter?
---
I mean, you literally just commented here to be a prick - and then  you're surprised people react negatively to you?  
---
Like, there's a billion and one constructive things you could have added; maybe I was underperforming and deserved the kick for holding the others up, "that doesn't represent retail as a whole" or "well, a few bad eggs aside it's stil a great game."    
---
 But instead you chose what's essentially the equivalent to " lul fake and gay"
---
Anyone getting the "wow51900328" enable ipv6 in the system settings on the wow login screen. Worked for me.

Is he actually an angry BFA kid? Lol
---
Probably not
---
Wasn't there a case where Blizzard catched a guy who DDoS the server and he got  sued and is sitting in jail now for 10 year or so?
---
Yes this game is really grindy in terms of questing. I sometimes level whole levels by just killing mobs for 2 hours so the next set of quests are a little bit easier (yes 1 level higher is a huge step up) I also dislike questing heavily in retail. But I love questing in Classic because a lot of people are around and want to group up etc. It feels much more alive. In retail it feels you playing a single player game. In classic you sometimes have to group up for hard mobs or just because of mob tags. I love questing in classic and I HATE IT in retail.
---
Yep, can confirm.
---
What is the price add on you are using?
---
Shamans can't dual wield in vanilla.
---
I hope he didn't tell you shaman was a good dps class. They are not.
---
Shaman dps at end game is among the lowest in the game.
---
I was a shaman in vanilla and wish someone warned me that the only decent pve spec for shaman was healing. 
---
If you want to do damage don't roll a class with a heal button.
---
enable ipv6 in the system settings on the wow login screen got me in right away
---
Wow u did the quest in dustwallow marsh then?!! 
---
I never had the patience to do it once i reached 225
---
Obvious troll
---
That‚Äôs just the Barrens.
---
more like the opposite of cool... im off for the weekend because the sheer amount of people contesting all zones/mobs.... its literally unplayable right now outside dungeon groups
---
That's a Wacom Bamboo Splash pen tablet. That is a man of the arts on a budget.
---
I play wow from time to time on my Wacom Cintiq myself.
---
blizzard specifically said otherwise. theyve explained that they can dynamically add/remove layers on the go and that the servers arent at their technical limit, but rather an artificial limit set by blizzard to more closely fit vanilla server populations.
---
You don't even understand what DDoS'ing is but don't let that stop you from saying stupid ass shit like this.
---
I do have an alt which I used to enjoy but it's a priest with slow ttk and I'm forced to go through the same content by main went through and it gets tedious especially when pausing for a mana break every few mobs.
---
Yeah, cant log in either
---
I would probably just use primarily heroic strike and keep demo shout on your enemies and battle shout on your allies. you're probably gonna have to taunt a lot tbh, tank threat is tough early on
---
This time EU too? seems so. Didnt notice it yesterday.
---
Then unless you're at gold cap just roll need on everything and fuck everybody. Cool. Got it.
---
/ignore
---
What‚Äôs the name of the addon  he has that makes it look like you‚Äôre a rare mob on the top left of his UI it looks super dope
---
Isn‚Äôt classic just a remaster?
---
And you still managed to be wrong AND condescending. Pretty impressive
---
It's an addon called BronzeDragonFrame. It gives you a bronze dragon frame but With a little tweak in the lua file you can change it to silver
---
Here's someone who doesn't understand how DDOS attacks works.
---
Aww man I was hoping I wouldn't see my realm in the list of affected servers.
---
We don‚Äôt know how high up this thing goes. Trust no one
---
I had a similar situation in felwood yesterday. 60 Horde 'lock would throw three dots on me every time I rode by. As a rogue, those kill me like 1.5x over, so I'd have to ride out of los, use a potion, then sit and eat through it. Very rough, but I couldn't stop him so I just learned to deal.
---
My memory sucks I guess- don‚Äôt remember it at all.
---
That's retail... there is no dual wielding for shamans in classic was not a class feature tell TBC even than was a talent not passive. Failed ur Google search mate lol.
---
Flight path collection is a great idea, it will take a while and be super helpful later on
---
I NEED an add on for dungeon maps! Atlas doesn't work.
---
ƒ∞ dont even play wow just copied it from wiki dk
---
I went to subway, would not recommend.
---
Need means need, greed means greed.
---
There is a reason that needing a BoE makes it soul bound on retail. Need means I am going to use that item.
---
And before you say "Go back to retail noob", thats just how it should be.
---
Do you have a link on how to make that change.
---
Killing for blood! You need to kill hundreds of them to drain their blood to fill tiny vial. Also someone wants to drink theirs horns or whatever...
---
Have the back and forth and the drama that comes out of these moments is also an important (but frustrating) part of that social/community.
---
Why are you still doing this lol. Yikes
---
The real gay latino? 
---
Beautiful and brave.
---
Blizzard said kazzak is the only one on a hard leesh
---
Can't dual wield in Classic.
---
That's why the concept of shrinkage estimation exists.
---
Don't reproduce
---
Horde has an repair vender in splinter tree on the left side of the inn entrance if I‚Äôm not mistaken.
---
After the teens, all questing areas for both factions are contested territory.
---
Do you even know what a DDoS attack is? If you did, you wouldn't be saying "hurr durr Blizzard is letting it happen hurr durr." Denial of service attacks are **unstoppable**.
---
The only way to stop a DoS attack is to directly shut down the attacker at the source. DDoS means there are potentially tens of thousands of attackers, and they're all anonymous and not tied to a person that can be held accountable.
---
If it was possible to fix this problem, Sony wouldn't get DDoSed, Twitch wouldn't get DDoSed, yet they do. You cannot prevent a DDoS, and stopping one is nearly impossible.
---
I feel there is a ton of nice changes in retail but the community part is hard to nail down
---
No joke my lock has spent more time treading water (4days /played) in arathi highlands than I have on land for the rest of my play time. Unending breath is by far the most valuable buff you can give people questing there so im actually the strongest buff giver for most of my classic experience!
---
If it is about rare spawns, people reset the dungeon themselves anyway. No need for respawns.
---
And if you have read my post, I'm not against a failstate. But having it rough timed respawns, independent of the length of the dungeon, makes no sense to me. Sometimes wipes even happen simply because someone got distracted by a door bell or something. And when play time is limited due to real world obligations, it's not a good thing that people feel like they have to go through a whole dungeon again just to get that feeling of accomplishment. That feeling should come fro and your group working together well and not from being able to always 100 percent focus on the game. At least from a casual perspective which is most of the audience. And the respawn thing adds nothing for no-life pros who aoe farm SM all the time.
---
Yes I don‚Äôt know much about how all this stuff works, I‚Äôm simply asking questions that I don‚Äôt know the answer too, are you being serious right now?
---
Same here, can't login
---
What do you get from raiding a faction city xp, loot?

Im pretty sure the terms of services state that religious names violate their policy.
---
Mogged to the Blasted lands
---
I'm trying to play a dagger spec rogue, I'm level 16 and getting pretty fucked tbh, can only handle one mob at a time, am I gimping myself by going daggers? I find combat quite boring well I think I would as it's mostly auto attacks, and I prefer the sub tree.
---
I think they've done a really nice job with the graphics. They've kept true to the original but given nice subtle face lifts at the same time.
---
People say nostalgia's remembered in HD and rarely does going back to a game and seeing the graphics live up the memory. This has defiantly been an exception imo
---
Why blur his name out? Let the piece of shit be known
---
Same thing is happening to me as well. I‚Äôve changed my security settings as blizzard recommends. I‚Äôve also restarted my computer(of course). And I‚Äôve even gone so far as to uninstall the client and reinstall. None of this has worked. The weird thing is I was just on and I alt F4‚Äôd our after updating some addons and that‚Äôs when this started. Even after deleting them all this is still happening.
---
Haha yeah.. I remember getting a Kara group together on alts and someone said our tank was very toxic in a 5 man he ran with him. Well,we didn't listen and the tank ended up being a real pain...
---
‚ÄúWeird‚Äù
---
You're in full bread mode now.
---
I am a Christian and if you are too and really want to share the gospel of Jesus, I my advice is to take the name change and be an awesome dude in game.  Help people, be generous, and actually talk with people.  If they're open to a discussion about it, share how we're all sinners in need of saving because nobody's good enough to go to Heaven.
---
In today's culture, people are extra sensitive to what they don't like/understand and everyone has to agree with everyone, so it doesn't surprise me you were reported; after all Jesus said that the world would hate him and his followers.  
---
At the end of the day, being forced to change your name sucks, but at least you're not doing a decade of hard labor in North Korea for what you believe in.
---
Druid is one of the harder classes to pick up. Healing is easy end game on a druid. You may have been misinformed

Fawk yea

The server where someone sold 10g runecloth bags on the AH and made enough for an epic mount within 2-3 weeks of the shard being created.
---
Why don't you try using Google you smooth brained idiot.
---
https://www.pcgamer.com/why-are-ddos-attacks-so-hard-to-stop/
---
And the mage can use the same stuff? The point is, if both are using equal items the mage always wins, that's just how it is.
---
Extended questlog I believe
---
No thanks I'll continue clogging up your servers just to make you mad.
---
then you can't do shit like this. Also if you want to level, it will impede your leveling if every 3 minutes some random nerd charges you, and you could even potentially die from it, which would slow your leveling even more. And finally, some people find peaceful interactions to be just as fun/cool as PvP itself. Thank you for coming to my ted talk
---
You aren‚Äôt really forced to do same content, you could move to a different races starter zone
---
They hit the network provider this time
---
Worked for me. Thanks
---
Because gear is meant to be used. That is its primary purpose not to be sold for gold. The primary purpose outranks the secondary purpose hence it's need before greed.
---
No idea where you heard that, but he didn't do a single dungeon and didn't touch layering until level 58 (after already being so far ahead nobody could hope to catch him anyways)
---
fair enough but i played today without any problems thats why I am confused now
---
Everyone who disagrees with you must be a troll üôÑ
---
Thank you for this response,  I‚Äôm not worried about world firsts or any records I just want the chance at epic items and just doing raids with my guild. Doing dungeons with them is already fun I can‚Äôt imagine 35 other people too
---
I'm not on your realm so I can't group up and help you but if you have questions about anything I can help you out that way just pm me. Also stick with it and you'll grow to love the game. One day everything will click
---
Enjoyed mage in Everquest. I wouldn't mind a bruiser if it was more recommended.
---
I was wondering if this was in Classic.
---
I say this cause I was somewhat upset to find Ahab Wheathoof was missing in Bloodhoof Village cause the kid's memorial was actually made in TBC. Despite the quests in Mulgore being the same, mostly. Started in TBC myself.
---
The servers are having problems right now. You have asked 3 times so far wondering about issues you are having. The servers are having problems right now.
---
Context matters. If I go into a blizzard sub and talk about d2 I'm usually talking about Diablo. If I go into a destiny sub I'm usually talking about destiny. 
---
Or at least that was my interpretation of the comment.
---
First, unzip the addon you downloaded into your `World of Warcraft/_classic_/Interface/AddOns` folder, then restart the game.
---
On the character select screen, bottom left, there's an "addon" button, click it and see if the addon is active.
---
Whitemane is gonna be a great server to be on after layering. Already really diggin' it except for the queues still.
---
Earthbind kiting only works on private servers, it's way less effective on official servers.
---
Just take a breather and keep checking reddit to see when people start to get back on.
---
Who‚Äôs cutting onions? Why‚Äôs my childhood flashing before me.
---
What? Where's this path at?
---
/u/genmills math's looks fine to me so I guess
---
(1/100)\*(1/100)\*(1/100)= 0.0001% chance of happening. I got a sense that the reasoning is not right in the case of 3 people.
---
Nice strawman.
---
Rerelease is closer to reality
---
Pet class, and survival abilities. it's not for everyone, hunter has similar but better lowbie dps imo
---
Can I tank low level dungeons (DM, Stockades, etc) as an arms warrior with a shield, or will I need to take some prot talents? Questing is hard going as it is so wondering if it‚Äôs worth it
---
You get more currency from quest the higher you get, along with higher vendor trash items.
---
What are your opinions on 'should've'
---
You mean you traced it and colored it purple?
---
Yes, i agree but layers is related to server pop/queues for a functional game. Coming out and saying "nothing to do" is not an accurate statement as it clearly does have something to do with a functional game, and by blizz's own statements is something that's considered.
---
True wow Player
---
Isn‚Äôt 16 a bit low for deadlines?
---
Imagine having a level 15 shammy and not just dpsing or starting your own group.  You need to relax take groups when you can find them and quest.  As for being heals or tank spec, that doesnt come into play until at least lvl 50.  My shadow priest and arms warrior guildmates have been my tank/healer for almost all of my dungeons.  Take a spec that quests well and do a little research on tanking.
---
After that, fake it till you make it.  With your new info because you researched warrior low level tanking you now know that the only two skills you need are sunder and demo shout.  Get lead as soon as you enter and instance and mark dps targets with skull.  If a ranged pulls taunt.  If a melee pulls, sunder it.  Watch your healers mana and try to keep pulling to maintain rage.  If the dps keeps pulling tell them in chat to only dps the skull or to give you a few seconds.  Always try to be at least within 3 levels of the final boss, it makes a dungeon so much easier when you can actually hit it.
---
Edit: i dont think you need lead to mark anymore.
---
I too am still experiencing the same error code. I would assume we are just going to have to wait, and they state it could be internet provider based?
---
Give the good boi his treat.
---
Yep :3 Enchants will help keep the gear relevant, and the 1% hit 6-set bonus is huge as there isn't any/much hit gear until the 50s.
---
Extrapolation of the argument.
---
This is the kind of situation that other MMO devs like CCP respond to with subscription compensation. I don‚Äôt see why Blizzard thinks it‚Äôs ok for people to lose payed playtime and not be reimbursed.
---
Thanks for the reply!! I‚Äôve been enjoying the leveling and I‚Äôm only lvl 30. Such a great game and I just want to do as much of it as I can
---
Chill out fatty
---
I tend to do about 3 at a time and turn them in.
---
Yeah as a rogue I‚Äôm on the hunt for mages.
---
Pick up EVERYTHING. And vendor it 
---
Always have empty bags
---
US servers
---
Has anyone stopped to think that he may be in a country with no extradition treaties or  LEO cooperation with the US or various other countries with a vested interest in the corporations he's affecting? The are plenty of known hackers/groups in various parts of the world wanted by a bunch of people living openly because of this.
---
they're removing them slowly already
---
also ive been @ stv since lvl 30, it was not even 10% close to this bad
---
He eats better than i do lol.
---
A med-pop server today has more people on it than a full server back in the day. If that gives you any information
---
12 millions were during WoTLK. About Classic noone knows and Blizzard stated during the AMA they don't intend to give us numbers.
---
I already have four names on my Ninja/Asshole list.
---
One of them tried to get in our ZF group and it was a delight to get him kicked, especially as it was rather late and we were the only group around at the time.
---
But that is what you get for Rolling Need on All loot in SFK (Even intelligence Items) as a Rogue and the Assassin Blade before putting it on the AH.
---
The best part is that his name is apparently being spread around already as he seems to have been doing the whole "Ninja" business for a while now.
---
You can make a macro to instantly open a trade window and put a healthstone in it! Made a lot of friends this way
---
You are more likely to make money doing low level runs for newbs. When you are lvl 40 you can take 4 newbs (lv 15) through deadmines and charge 25silver each. They will all make more money than that while in the dungeon plus exp and new gear, you will get some loot for vendor in dungeon, netting you a profit of about 2gold per run. I recommend this over charging to tank a dungeon that is at your level, because the group will just find a tank who will do it for gear upgd in dungeon without charging.
---
Edit: forgot to say take off all your gear before doing this. Repair cost will ruin your profit.
---
I had about 20g~ at level 31, and I'm currently at 41 with about 80g (10g away from a mount), so you are pretty on track.
---
The more you level up, the more gold you get from mobs, the better the rewards from quests are, and you can sell trash items for something like 1g+ each. 
---
&gt;Is the trick to just not buy skills?
---
This plays a big part of it, if I didn't level up a few of my (non-essential) skills and skipped out on raising my mining/engineering, I'd have a mount by now.
---
Yeah, cleaving/tanking 5-mans is the plan. Questing as a warrior is miserable.
---
How much gold you earn accelerates a lot between 30 and 40.
---
I think that you'll make most by running dungeons. Also, get auctionator or some other addon that tells you the vendor price. Putting stuff on the AH costs money, and you lose a percentage of the vendor price every time you put something up (the longer you put it up, the bigger the percentage).
---
He's also an amazing chef and cooks up a storm whenever we have LAN parties :).
---
What's the addon for the character and party portraits?  Would love to have that look
---
yes, you definitely can just throw on a shield and be fine. low level dungeons are pretty simple.
---
What level are you now?  Herod, always has an insanely long queue to login.
---
Yojamba?
---
It definitely does work, been using these since launch
---
This guy bankstands &gt;:]
---
you can ctrl+v into imgur.
---
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be
---
Not anymore it won‚Äôt.  Enjoy finding another name, snowflake.
---
I'm so glad I haven't grouped with anyone with this insane mentality yet when a BoE drops. We've always done the rational all need approach. Minor upgrade that will last for maybe 2-3 levels? Or the most valuable thing you can have in the game right now? (hint: it's gold)
---
IDK if people still do this, but my old roommate was flush with gold (back in LK days). He would use the dungeon finder and if the entire group was from another sever, he would just need on every roll because F-them, that's why. Kind of a dick move and I can imagine it would not fly if everyone is on the same server.
---
Just because you had one experience does not mean its the same for everybody.
---
&gt;That said WoW being "welcoming" in any era or server is laughable.
---
Really? Odd. Don't even need to be on a known rp server for people to just throw parties give stuff away for no reason. At least on my realm. And the dungeons are the friendliest parties in ever mmo I've played.
---
You can get gold otherways. You're just making an excuse for robbing people of gear. You're completely ignoring the existence and purpose of need and greed.
---
I must‚Äôve cleaved Arm and Cath 100 or more times on my way to 60, never saw the chest drop so kudos.
---

try to keep up, they're getting removed already slowly

---
Thank you very much!  Do you have any other addon tips for healing?  Leveling a priest and Love all the tips i can get!
---
They‚Äôre talking about the links that go to the data  centers of isps. Not your personal internet service. Unless someone just particularly dislikes you and singled you out to DDoS.
---
The solution is a communication protocol that leverages proof of work.
---
See: IOTA.
---
Can rogues use guns, and if so, at what level does the weapon trainer open it up? 
---
I thought they could, but only had the option to learn bows when I visited the trainer last night (level 18).
---
That's what I call Anepichero! Great info and legit funny!
---
How do show you don't give a shit about your job 101.
---
Gz
---
You rolled on it, you deal with it.
---
Snowflake.
---
So keep healing voidwalker and let it do all the damage work?
---
He sounds like a carebear.
---
I approve this message. My little wolf is a good boy. He gets hungry all the time too.
---
Exactly how I feel. you need vanishing powder to vanish, you need tinder and logs to start a campfire, you need a fishing pole to fish, the little things that make the game feel more role playing.
---
It is!
---
&gt; within 2-3 weeks of the shard being created.
---
Yeah, and now the market is full of cheaper shit.
---
Also usually these ppl are really dumb and leave footprints with thier botnets
---
And he has an epic ring!!!!! xD
---
Pretty sure this is intentional and has to do with queues.
---
Just dont be a salty racist kid 4Head
---
I mean you gotta level it up anyway eventually and you dont need all pre raid BiS to raid, so why not?
---
What. Not even a fraction of them go to prison. How do you realistically track the user of a botnet ?
---
I have not got any abilities to train life from enemy yet maybe that is the issue. I will try and stick to lower level mobs :)
---
When a stealth class runs past a tree and doesn't come out the other side.
---
Search on YouTube "shortcut to wetlands dwarf" and it should come up
---
They watch a lot of father ted and toast of London on this inside?

A super cute brave wow addict
---
While layering is in effect you can ask in lfg for layer invites. Might get you away from being griefed.
---
So hear me out. Why doesn‚Äôt law enforcement just rent out botnets do some IP tracing and reverse engineering then shut them down? Crazy I know.
---
Doesn't answer the question.
---
Mods get real twitchy about this sort of thing, so he was probably better to cover it up.
---
Dude is a dick for sure, but to be fair reddit is full of absolutely bonkers people who will create a character on that dude's realm and verbally abuse and threaten him for days or weeks.
---
Hi, /u/N60deep

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d1h5il/razorgore_eu_realm_first_ragnaros_pug/). 
---
Couldn‚Äôt have said it better myself. For The Horde!
---
I guess the one good thing is that you have 4 pets to choose from later on in the game at all times.
---
It's just an odd issue only effecting some people so I am jelouse of those who still get to play might have to glare at them angrily
---
Lulzsec and LizardSquad got caught and they seemed to kinda know what they were doing. This guy didn't even know how to get the server IPs for himself.
---
Mages are great in vanilla WoW, you have second to none AoE ability and crowd control, summon your own food and water, eventually you can teleport/create portals to any major city, amazing PvP, and top tier damage in endgame raids. As far as bruisers go warriors come to mind, they're an extremely high-effort high-reward class though. They have the potential to be absolute juggernauts in PvP and the absolute best damage in raids, but they're probably one of the hardest classes to level and gear up.
---
oh look a world that feels real and immersive as hell, oh look ITS CLASSIC
---
You can tank up until level 60 with a 2 hander and arms talents if you've got an alright group, our tank is an arms warrior and he's been fine to zf so far.
---
It has been over 2 hours and I still can't log in.

Yesturday was my only day all week i could go hard and play a lot so i was pretty devastated.

Posting shit on the AH costs money if it does not sell.

I can sympathize with them but they really need to know who to direct their anger at.

Having the little time they are able to play ruined sucks but they should be pissed at the people responsible, not blizzard

damn i‚Äôm glad i‚Äôm not ordering pizza from y‚Äôall. get that shit hella cold

What's the best way to get into dungeons as a new player, 22 Nelf Druid?
---
Because the Chinese don‚Äôt extradite their own. I guess someone wasn‚Äôt paying attention during The Dark Knight.
---
This person is literally playing wow on his pc. He had the time to take out his phone, unlock it, go to camera, takes photo, opens reddit and posts. It‚Äôs unbelievable bc people can‚Äôt be this stupid unless they are zoomers.
---
Glad I can keep myself busy beating women and shitting on minorities
---
Improvise, adapt, overcome
---
Yes, while they get rammed hard like a Piper Perri video
---
I‚Äôm a Gnome Warlock. I read that the good professions are engineer and tailoring. Because of the gnome boost and the warlock armor. But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs good to have both because neither one helps the other. Which one should I switch and what should I switch it to? I‚Äôm only lvl 15 so it isn‚Äôt the end of the world switching either
---
Dropped from one of the ZF zombies too - don't even see them listed for the drop table on classicDB.
---
I farmed SM graveyard for 2 hours and got around 7g from mobs and sold items to vendor + 5g from items sold on AH.   
---
And yes, not upgrading some spells is a way to have enough at 40.
---
toon is Raveni√ßa (fancypants c is alt 135) hit me up? level 15 druid myself :)
---
Sounds like bullshit. If you were scared of a queue you could just once in a while go press a button on your computer whilr you cook. Nice cat though
---
They should have removed it by level 5 lmao
---
Holding it on the crotch is a great way of achieving impotency.
---
If everybody need everything (everybody need gold DUH)  Then why there is even need  and greed options?
---
If you use default raid frames or have the option to ‚Äúshow missing health‚Äù for hp text, it‚Äôs great for selecting heal ranks since you can pretty quickly memorize ‚ÄúHeal3 heals for x, Heal2 heals for y‚Äù and pick based on what you see.
---
And yeah, most healing with good aggro management is just casting my biggest Heal/GHeal on the tank when they get to half. Usually throw a renew (bubble if they‚Äôre a pally) at the end if they‚Äôre getting smacked.
---
Thanks, anything like the for the crafting windows
---
I was actually playing a bunch of 2k4 before classic launched lol
---
Free character transfer. If you don't have it in the shop then maybe your realm is not eligible for transfer?
---
Hey, when you're doing underwater Quests in Strangle or Arathi, you WISH there'd be a warlock nearby!
---
No it isn‚Äôt
---
Ddos retard probably can‚Äôt afford the subscription ;)
---
I was in stonetalon and me and the other folks in General had a Twilight zone moment as we all reported our guildies going offline and then people stopped responding one by one...
---
lmaaaaooo
---
a hard case of little dick syndrome.
---
If it's an actual transfer. It's only available to a specific realm. Each one has a corresponding realm.
---
That‚Äôs my point. The devs are likely just as annoyed with these Low lives. Seeing a lot of moaning, but it‚Äôs not blizzards fault. They are trying to get us back online. Just gotta be patient.
---
You should quit too
---
Gotcha. Thanks for the clarification. The wait continues.
---
lol damn, and here I was hoping for the chest to drop in the half a dozen times I ran it :3 I got a decent price on the chest and boots, so it didn't sting too much.
---
As a hunter you want the slowest weapon possible. Look for 3.2 speed crossbows. As stated above you want to be able to cast aimed shot without have your autoshot wait for the aimed shot to finish casting.
---
If you compare two hunters in a long fight the hunter with the slowest weapon will win overall even if the weapons are similar except in attack speed.
---
&gt;How expensive is 300 mining??
---
The training cost is 5g.
---
&gt; I get that eng is a cash sink but mining too?
---
If you're selling your mats, it's very profitable. If you're using the mats to raise engineering, you'll typically be at a loss compared to the AH.
---
Gotta stop training all those useless skills &amp; ranks
---
Play either class. If you pick shaman just grab some gear with int and heal in current spec. It doesn't matter til high 50s if that.
---
Same applies on warrior. Don't spec prot until raiding, just tank in fury or arms. Many people are tanking 2h fury dungeons at 60. 
---
Don't revolve your spec around low level dungeons. Use them to break up the grind.
---
Why don‚Äôt people just rent them the same way these idiots do and then shut them down
---
What are good professions for a druid? I'm on a pvp server.
---
I'm thinking skinning/LW, or mining/engineering.
---
Special Olympus.
---
You‚Äôre an idiot.
---
Is this on Razorgore-EU? I recognize the guildname
---
i also like neatplates
---
I‚Äôm still using the mail chest from end of WC on my warrior at 45.
---
Its a world drop
---
Stalagg.
---
You get it. BOE is different than BOP. There is an opportunity cost that exists in a BOE drop situation that doesn‚Äôt exist in a BOP item situation. A BOP item would have only sold to a vendor for the rogue for a minimal amount. This isn‚Äôt ninjaing an item at all.
---
I fucking transferred I‚Äôm majorly regretting it
---
You are telling people the way they deal with their issues is a problem and is unsupportable. That‚Äôs not helping people get better my guy
---
No, you're an idiot.
---
Your comment doesn't answer the question.
---
Having played from day one on Vanilla, experienced hundreds of outages/disruptions, and I can count on one hand how many one-day credits I got for it.
---
The original unreal came out at like the same time, unreal tournament was an "expansion" to unreal
---
What addon is that quest log on the left?
---
wee woo
---
It's not concrete only because Blizzard hadn't hard-coded it into the game at that point like they eventually did.
---
Looking to get hold of some scrolls. Wowhead says that this guy sells them: https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=1316/adair-gilroy
---
But I can't find him when I go to those coords. Is this guy actually in the game?
---
/u/landsoul is this you?
---
It‚Äôs always the rogues
---
Figured it out. Here's what worked for me.
---
* Go to System from the login screen.
---
* Go to Network.
---
* Enable "Use IPv6 when available."
---
I keep my kitchen door shut so the cats can't steal any food on the sides lol :P
---
You must've played on a dead server. On Illidan i'd say it was about 3 times the population in major cities. A lot of this is because everyone is leveling tho?
---
no Stormwind Harbor ever*
---
Still happening to me
---
play Warlock
---
I have  been going out of my way to give someone under water breathing if they  buff me.
---
Must be
---
You should be able to. May not have been available from that specific weapons trainer
---
I leveled my dwarf priest to 20 and I just really cant get into it. The leveling feels boring, I die a lot, and I feel like I have zero world pvp/group pvp ability. 
---
I leveled an orc rogue to 6. The main reason I wanted to play ddwarf priest is because I figured it be easier to find groups at 60 playing casually. Will this still be possible as a rogue?
---
You really have to roll need on something you won't sell for like a year?
---
I remember in vanilla. I made a gnome warri and used charge on bunnies to get there.
---
You literally screenshotted the places ive been to.
---
But i think they changed textures up there compared to vanilla. Maybe it has always been like that and i cant remember it for 100%.
---
I dont know but i know what i will do tomorrow when i log in again!
---
Not worried at all. People will clear all the dungeons and raids alot faster this time around because the game has been out for 15 years. You could look at this as a bad thing but personally I see it as a good thing. This means we don't need to min max nearly as much this time around which means a raid can take boomkins and ret pallys and other specs that never got a chance to raid the first time around. Also it takes A LOT of time to get 40 people geared. I don't think we have to worry about to much time between phases.
---
I felt that.
---
You sound like your stepfather molested you one too many times and you've learned to enjoy it.
---
Damn you just wanna really double down on being wrong huh?
---
Go to the girls locker room
---
You're only leaving it at that cause you know you don't know anything.  Neither of us can ever claim we really know what's going on.  So I don't understand why you are trying to push this point.  We can't rule out anything so why say its a simple DDoS attack?  Going to jail isn't fun you know.
---
Yes...
---
I'm completely bipolar in this game and idk why. Sometimes I help alliance struggling. Sometimes I murder them and inhale their frustrations to give me power.
---
Edit: I also /fart on ally in alliance zones.
---
Paid Transfers will be a thing because they were a thing in Vanilla.
---
They've said a few times now that they want the dust to settle from launch and layering gone before they open up paid transfers.
---
that sounds dangerous
---
It's unfortunately the case that paladins aren't great tanks in classic. They lack a lot of utility that bears and warriors have, and their reliance on mana puts them in a bad spot. That said, you can totally tank while leveling. Paladins are also great end game healers, so it's not like you'll be playing a "useless" class or something. On the other hand if you want to specifically be a tank, you should probably roll a warrior. They're a little bit grueling to level, but if you put the time into getting the gear you need, you'll be a monster.
---
As a non skinner this time around the leather scraps made me happy because I instantly thought of the joy of finding soft patches of fur.
---
Id rather get the stats because no one buys 300g items this early in the game lololol
---
&gt; SMOrc 
---
I don't even play on Whitemane and I already know these guys are morons. I see their name everywhere.
---
So because it's used often, you think it's okay to say? Do you not have any social awareness of what is acceptable? Or are you one of those kinds of people that feel safe behind their computer, being able to say that kind of stuff without and repercussions? I hope you do risk a ban lol
---
I've only replied to chain once dawg.
---
Lol my guild name is &lt;u think u do but u dont&gt;
---
I've never had a stepfather.....
---
Or the elite quests with the murlocs in STV.
---
You can play the game without ever getting one 1-120
---
Hence why I wouldn‚Äôt roll on it if another melee DPS wouldn‚Äôt want me to. Jesus, what‚Äôs with all the whining. It‚Äôs an upgrade, regardless. If the hunter is courteous enough to not roll because someone else could use it more, then who cares if it‚Äôs not a bow. You know, some Hunters are complete buffoons.
---
Read my post in context. I was merely pointing out most hunters would prefer the Corpsemaker for X reason over the Polearm. And due to that, I would create a group with the dynamics I choose to improve my chances (even though I didn‚Äôt this time as there is very little reason for me to go to RFK other than quests).
---
What addons are you using?
---
Oh yeah that‚Äôs right, how silly of me
---
I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs all that indecent to prioritize your own needs over strangers. It‚Äôs not like the non-tailors don‚Äôt benefit from this.
---
Download Twitch, and launch WoW Classic from the Twitch app. You can also browse addons there, and it will install them for you, and prompt you when they need updating.
---
Any word on the reasoning for that? I've like to transfer from a high population PvE realm to a PvP Realm. 
---
I thought i could make it with friends, but i can't stand PvE, even if the alternative is to play alone. :(
---
No that is actually the entire point of equipment your example is just loops of nonsense. You sell the equip to buy your own equips or increase your power. Youre putting yourself over other people purely out of greed.
---
Gravekeeper
---
Nice, didn't think of that
---
It's a combo of armor reducing the damage received and evis not scaling off attack power
---
&gt;Ninja looting is if ONE person takes an unfair advantage over the others. As in this example I already gave:
---
That isn't the definition of ninja looting, lol.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Loot_ninja
---
"loot ninja, AKA ninja looter or simply ninja, is a player who takes loot to which he or she is not entitled. "
---
I'd say you're not entitled to a tailoring recipe if you're not a tailor.
---
I really don‚Äôt think Herod is that bad now. 1-2 hour queues a week and a half after launch during prime play times? Pretty awesome. The leveling zones aren‚Äôt bad either. It‚Äôs nice having people in the world to help you quest.
---
awesome, yeah this worked for me. Thank you
---
How dare people use slang? Good-for-nothing villains, the lot of them
---
All that spam for cleave groups? Those are being made to faceroll stuff. Chain pull multiple packs at a time, everyone mashes face on keyboard with aggro everywhere, clear at least twice as fast as a 'normal' group.
---
So just roll need on literally everything then, could always use the gold
---
Try 100g
---
Follow the road east until you get to a new zone
---
The chances of this happening again are exactly the same as the chances of it happening the first time!
---
Every possible permutation of rolls is equally rare. The chance of everyone rolling the same number is the same as everyone rolling anything else.
---
Well you already kinda said it. But you could just set your demon to stay and then run really far away and gain the shard back.
---
They'll do the same thing they did before, which combined multiple low-pop realms.
---
From what I remember, the best blacksmithing gear is all BoE.  Alchemy will give great utility, as will engineering.
---
Yeah but you still claimed OP was correct after replying to the comment that proved him wrong.
---
If I give a gun to a mass shooter, I‚Äôm still guilty.
---
Semantics are fun huh buddy &gt;:).
---
Lots and lots of people
---
Thank u kind sir
---
You don't need to sell it right now. Didn't think that part needed explaining but here we are...
---
Many players used to play for the twink scene and surely it will blossom again. Even if players can't pay for the items yet (like you said, they don't need to for a while anyway), they will be in high demand eventually.
---
Thanks! I can‚Äôt remember, there is no such thing as dual spec right? Can‚Äôt remember when that happened.
---
To be fair, if/when that demon gets too far out of range they dismiss themselves and you're refunded the shard.
---
Was expecting to see something about Asmongold
---
Oo0h im on Benediction. This is nice to know
---
The people need to eat!
---
I love this piece!
---
I might buff hunter pets...... Unless they are being a dick, then I sanc them.

Ah yes in 04 i got camped relentlessly here on my hunter lol. Good times.

Edit: nvm this looks like the dwarf cave. I was getting corpsefucked in the one by tarrenmill
---
Laughs In in FFXIV
---
Imagine making this much of a stink for two days worth of playtime, basically $1.
---
No one said 40 or lower, since you lack the capacity to understand numbers mid 40s would be 43 to 47. 43 &gt; (or greater than) 40.
---
Mancalla
---
Not a debate at all, it's literal definition.
---
Asmon knows more about vaginas than he does bitcoin and shit that those people deal with.
---
Sad part is that I think he might actually be right about the ban. Especially if he records his gameplay, Blizz will take his side if he has proof and ban you for griefing.
---
I kept trying to tp to SW and it would fail but eat my runes, I don't want to be dramatic but if I don't get my 18 silver back I AM QUITTING THIS GAME
---
Thank you. Will have a sus
---
check edit
---
This is why no one respects girl gamers.
---
You see, there are many of us who dont play this game hardcore. we rarely have money to buy truly rare stuff and good items from AH. 
---
Ffs those 1/1000000, when good item drops. Some asshole ninja needs it and leaves group.
---
Dude it's banter lmao. Always one comment that takes it seriously
---
Lol i make 1g in 1minute get 60 bro
---
Don't see it being viable at all, as mention there are two common builds single target and aoe the build you added does both but worse. The other builds are also able to both but completely outshine all others in the desired situations which are situations you force as much as possible for levelling.
---
I have a screenshot of me rolling the same number as a guy like 4 times in a row.
---
Fish
---
Yeah its definitely possible to find groups with relative ease but it won't be as easy as a healer
---
Care to share?
---
Not a big of them but Imagine Dragons did a really great cover of this in the Proclaimers hometown a few years back.
---

---
a true alliance
---
lol i put my cat on my keyboard please updoot
---
The pixels have no real world equivalent and to assume otherwise means you participate in real money trading which is expressly forbidden by blizz devs.
---
I love how there's no honor or money on the line, just random big skirmishes then everyone goes home haha
---
Why should we care about this guy again?
---
Okay. The last ditch effort here it goes
---
Well you aren't wrong.
---
Kinda hard when one gets shit on for no reason, in this case ganking someone by one shot.
---
Winner winner chicken dinner! If I had gold, I‚Äôd give it. Thanks! Gonna go enjoy a joint and play!
---
To give a more try-hard answer, if you want to know go you‚Äôre pulling your weight, you want to look at your own contribution toward the dungeon getting cleared and how much fun people had doing it.
---
Someone else mentioned blessings and utility, but if that utility is just ‚Äúsort of nice‚Äù and your blessings are giving them an extra 2% damage, but your own damage is 60% of the next lowest dps then you‚Äôre probably not pulling your weight.
---
You might be raising morale, you might have a better understanding of the pulls or dungeon, etc.
---
To get a better idea of the raw numbers, you can install a dps addon like ‚Äúdetails!‚Äù, which will tell you exactly how you stack up.
---
3 options pay a mage for a portal to SW. Pay a lock in SW to summon her. Or have her take the boat to menithal and run to IF and take the tram to SW.
---
Think it depends heavily on which server you play on, mine has been very nice and funny, haven't noticed any overwhelming toxicity at all.
---
&gt; Bliz has shown how ridiculously fast you can flip between these different instances of a continent, likely all of the layers could be merged into one and performance would be a-ok.
---
I should certainly hope so given that's the plan later.
---
Raid clears happening this early are by veteran's or private server players. Someone who has to ask what role each classes plays will not have the knowledge or skillset to do what was done.
---
8 years playing retail... 
---
1 week playing classic and now retail looks like trash :(
---
You disconnected too eh?
---
I like a good mix of both, some of the quests have a decent story IMO so I've more incentive than just XP/rewards to complete the quests.
---
That said, I've spent at least a day each grinding worgens in Duskfall and the Orc farm in Arathi H just for the fun of it.
---
Booting router let me get back in
---
auction house is too overfilled with stuff, ive never had anything sell, always undercut minutes after posting T_T
---
im a hunter and have been leveling leatherworker along with skinning instead of just selling the materials
---
maybe ill level an alt with skinning and enchanting and just skine everything and vendor it all
---
So instead of focusing on the overall point, you nitpick on numbers? If you changed the 40, to 50, or even 60, the sentence still holds.
---
Look at the actual phase 1 bis gear. It's approximately 70% bop, 30% boe. and of the boe gear, I believe only 2 pieces are non-crafted or non-guaranteed drops (the only rng is the XXX of the YYY suffix.)
---
Ummm I think I had a similar issue, have you been able to get to WoW Classic in the battlenet launcher yet? Because I kept having that problem until I finally installed the game by selecting WoW, then clicking the little drop down menu and selecting WoW Classic and installing it. If this isn't your issue then I'm not sure :/
---
work started for those that took 1-2 weeks off. people are past the honeymoon phase and have realized the game isnt going anywhere. blizzard increase how many per layer the servers can hold. school is in full swing so homework and extracurricular activities are a focus (with some parents not playing because of them).
---
all this added up to shorter queues.
---
Benedicktucks
---
Love this
---
This criminal openly bragged about it on Twitter and isn‚Äôt hiding their intentions lmao
---
Also going after Twitch which is owned by Amazon... genius tactic there with Amazon‚Äôs long reach...
---
At that level basically spam sunder and taunt if someone pulls it off you.
---
Hot dam it works
---
How the hell you got so much money? Level 41 here and barely got half of my mount money together...
---
How on earth does gold help me level faster than killing enemies faster?   You get xp by killing and completing quests, not riding around on a mount.
---
Are you sure? I don't think extended quest log has level displayed? I hope you're right because I've been looking for ages.
---
Can things like Heavy Armor Kits be removed, or can I put a better Armor Kit on the same item later, or do they stack? I have a blue piece of armor that I think I will be using for a while, and I wanted to upgrade it but not if it's irreplaceable.
---
Ineedreinforcmentfrompeopleidontknow. O maybe that‚Äôs to long for you
---
It's Clique still a thing?
---
Nah, that one's just a green item.
---
I should seek help for calling out bigotry? I am confused, you gotta be really stupid to get Nazi logic I guess.
---
Max think
---
Oh my yes! I feel like I realize something new about the characters and the interplay every time I watch it! Even tho I know how it ends, it still thrills!
---
i hadnt played wow in a long time and shortly before legion came friend and I installed it again. We went to max level - everything fine - world seems pretty dead but thats just how it is now we thought. Then legion came. I could not complete a single quest. I am not even exegerating, it was literally unplayable because we were ALWAYS dead and corpse camped. A little bit of googling later we found out that NOT EVEN 1% of our server is alliance. And transfers had to be paid. WTF!? We quit the game directly and never looked back, but are here for classic of course. What the fuck do people think that this is ok? And there is even a deeper issue - the one thing is that its absolutly not okay to have this imbalanced servers, but the more important thing is that retail is so boring and bad that we didnt even notice before!
---
why do you want a forum for people to post they're hosting when twitch wowclassic has all the streams listed?  i wouldn't be surprised if youtube had the option to see just specific games too.
---
Nah you don't get that level of control over it. You just get to use a few commands to make the botnet do stuff. It is like a chatroom.
---
Who?
---
Whitemane here as well, same problem. Hopefully resolved soon cause I just sat in queue just to get a bug :^(
---
You deserve a gold star
---
Can someone recommend a good healing addon? Thanks
---
Hmm, it does it for me with any sort of click/touch.  Strange.
---
It's probably your server. I play on Faerlina, I'm lvl 42 and I still haven't found one are where I don't have to fight for mobs with both my faction (alliance) and the horde.       
---
Even on Desolace and Swamp of Sorrows I never had less than 5/6 players trying to do the same quest as me. Yesterday I logged out at 3am and I was "fighting" 5 players for a small quest on Swamp of Sorrows.        
---
        
---
With no layers it would be 99% impossible to quest on Faerlina, even at 5 am on a Thursday.

Easiest way to Thunder Bluff from Undercity or Orgrimmar? Not sure if there is a zeppelin that can get me there.

What logic do you want? 
---
You guys are bad people, and the less we have to deal with people like you the over all better game we have
---
Yes any other buff will replace it
---
&gt;1. You can download an addon that can track damage done but barring that make sure you're keeping buffs up on your party, stunning casters and healers at key moments to prevent heals/damage going off, off healing when it looks like your healer needs help, and picking up any mobs that run astray from the tank onto squishier classes  
---
&gt;2. Not that I know of. Keep in mind that your class benefits from both physical damage and damage/healing gear since about half of your damage is holy which gives you a wide array of pieces that can be useful to you. Look up a ret pally class guide for more in depth info about what stats/gear you should be on the lookout for.  
---
&gt;3. You can look up world of warcraft dictionary and it should give you a pretty comprehensive list of slang. The most useful of which is LFG (Looking for Group), LFM (Looking for More), WTS (Want to Sell), and WTB (Want to Buy). Most locations will be abbreviated to the first letter of each word ex. AB (Arathi Basin), IF(Ironforge), SW (Stormwind), etc.
---
At 60 any class is good to farm really, I loved my shaman, fill black dragon scale armor and the exalted mace from av, could one shot just about anything with the storm strike and wind fury. I don't think you will be disappointed later if you stick with it
---
Are you guys dating now?
---
I hate it. Yuck!
---
Engineering is much better than tailoring. You need some way to fund your engineering. You could either farm mobs, try to sell runs, play the action house, do dungeon farming, or take a gathering profession. No matter what you take (mining, skinning, herbalism, etc), ultimately you‚Äôre laboring to produce value, and then converting that value into materials for engineering, so pick the one that you enjoy and has a good gold/hr rate
---
Thats what sm farm is for
---
I would remake your character as an orc, they are ridiculous for horde warriors. 
---
I would go fury until level 40 then respec arms.
---
I'm glad to hear you got something good goin on for ya (: and I can only imagine how much I'm going to miss this job when I leave it ahah
---
&gt;it also means he has a bot net set up 
---
No it doesnt
---
Spoilers dude!
---
Necrosis. This addon also allows you to do other cool stuff: fast hearthstone trades, assigning a soul stone bag, deleting soul stones after x amount in bag, etc.
---
Fuckface, Knicker, Assmunch, Analnugget, Knicklit
---
Is it possible to gain exalted reputation with Darnassus as a human during phase 1? I've searched all over wowhead, youtube, etc. and I'm not finding a definite answer. If you start in Teldrassil at level one and continue on doing all the quests through all the night elf zones how much rep will that get you by the end of Feralas? Not enough to reach exalted if I had to guess. Will the repeatable runecloth turn in quest at level 50 be available in phase 1? What other ways are there to do it if any?
---
Classic is aged as fuck and has a bunch of gameplay mechanics that are either outdated or were questionable 15 years ago already.
---
Things that come to mind:
---
- Ridiculous respec costs. Considering that many builds are only really viable in certain circumstances makes it a pain in the ass to play a single character multiple ways. I honestly don't think the original devs thought that through very well.
---
- Weapon skills. They litteraly add nothing of value to the gameplay. I have no clue why they've made it into the game, neither 15 years ago nor now.
---
- Skill trees. Depending of what you want to do the skill trees we have now only offer an illusion of choice. Usually it is pretty obvious what the best talent choices are for any given situations. There is also the issue, that many specs are entirely useless outside of niche usage. They started to adress that with 2.0 but never really did anything about it in 1.X
---
- Item choices: Many speccs do not have proper choices and have to rely on items that aren't designed with them in mind. T-sets are usually only fit the "raid" spec (more or less).
---
Additions I would like to have (some of them quite ... controverse):
---
- Things to be able to customize your character. Character customization helps with character identification, which is - in my opinion - paramount for an RPG. I believe WoW to be kinda some sort of "RPG light" and I think it could be a bit deeper. This includes visual and mechanical customizations (stats AND gear).
---
- A proper LFG tool. And before you go all crazy: I am not talk about automatic matchmaking. The thing is, I am not of the opinion that spaming a chat is doing anything to help improve communication between players. The actual communication part comes afterwards, when you are doing that content. And thus I think finding people that want do to the same content faster means you also have more time to partake in actual communication. For how something like this could look, I imagine something akin to the M+ lfg system of retail or at least some "pinboard" style system.
---
- Graphic updates. They really need to redo the textures followed by the lightning. Those low resolution textures and simple lightning are really not doing the game a favour.
---
Wrong again bucko
---
Ya
---
Well when I played vanilla, I think I was around 48 when I had enough money to get my mount.
---
The open world used a group of realms with balanced factions, not sure when that started.
---
That's awesome!
---
That's fair!
---
Goblins honestly fit the traditional stereotypes more. Dwarves actually look like hasids, goblins look like third Reich propaganda posters.
---
A human dagger rogue? I can hear the REEEEEEE of a thousand angry nerds.
---
Don't think you know what the words "harmless" or "prank" mean. How about I turn off the power to your house during the summer for a couple hours. Making your food spoil and when you get angry, I just say "it was a harmless prank bro".
---
I‚Äôd say for every class they don‚Äôt really start coming into their own until mid 20‚Äôs. Warlocks cant really drain tank super effectively till ~26 because it requires certain talents to work well.
---
Chestnutz = new Leeroy?
---
That mfer got Whirlwind Axe aint nothing stoppin him.
---
Hell ye
---
Pathetic that a multi billion dollar corporation can't handle a ddos attack
---
Warlocks get a free mount at 40. Subtract ~90g to compare with most other lvl 46s.
---
account sharing arent allowed, ban inc
---
Don‚Äôt even need a shield really
---
One guy brings down Blizz.....
---
All are contested. But, there are zones where there are more horde/fewer alliance and vice versa. There are some trends but you can ask other horde on your server to get accurate info.
---
I've been "power leveling" every day since launch. Still going to be a few months haha.
---
For bop loot and cheap greens? Is this that hard to understand?
---
One, banks cant prevent this entirely. 
---
Two, doing this to a bank a way more illegal.
---
poop sock check

https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/warlock-dps-gear-bis-classic-wow
---
you have no fucking clue what youre talking about.  11 pieces are BoE pre raid BiS. Of those only 3 or 4 are tailoring and the rest are all boe green/blue/purple drops.
---
Who said anything about wiping?
---
If you think wiping is the only way to slow a run down then maybe you're one of the retard dps.
---
And if it's "hey man it's not really preventable," then there will always be another guy who will do the same.
---
Do you get paid to be a douche?
---
It is definitely some concern, but just need to supplement that time with leveling alts and pvping.
---
&gt; My literal first response said I was 30, guess what, I am 30.
---
You're 30 and acting like this? That's pathetic. Also, I'm younger than you so stop calling me a boomer...
---
I decided roll horde back on the p server I played on. When I was questing in ashenvale as an alliance and there was an average of about half a dozen horde and one 60 baby sitting them sitting right outside of astranaar ganking every time I went there. I remember one day asking ppl if they wanted to group up to fight them off while I got bad mouthed in general and told to roll pve. While arguing in general about 20 horde steamrolled astranaar killing everyone, there was even a level 60 ud rogue camping the grave yard. That was the day I decided I didnt want to play with a bunch of carebares who think rolling a pvp realm only means letting other players bend you over rather than doing something about it. In stv as a horde the other day we had ppl being ganked and we immedialty banded together and put the gankers in their place. Not regretting my decision to roll horde so far.
---
2h fury while okay is still way worse than MS/SS that you get from Arms.
---
You can make a macro
---
Lol those dudes are about to get blown tf up. Lucky for them recklessness -&gt; bladestorm isn't in classic
---
I don't think your faction matters in STV. On my server it's overrun with alliance
---
No greed is for if you want the item to get ninja'd by someone smarter than you.
---
(or if you want to just pass since everyone smart is rolling need on high-value boe blues/epics)
---
He also went after twitch or so he said, which I am sure cost someone money.
---
Those are good. Other than that Herbalism/Alchemy can be good because you can use stealth so sneak behind mobs and pick herbs without having to fight them.
---
Yeah, it even works well on an RPPVP server
---
Blakesands
---
Doesn‚Äôt fix my Issues unfortunately :(
---
What's that third buff from the left?
---
Mage has to drink after almost every pull lol no chance if we're talking about leveling "normally"
---
DDoS in 2019? Do people still not know how preventable this is in 2019?
---
Yeah there's no longer queueing for layering. It would just be more crowded out in the world. 
---
Queues have to do with server capacity, not zone capacity.
---
As a new player, don't worry about engineering. You can always switch later when you have lots of money and know more about the game. Alch/herb sounds fine, but I don't think you need gathered herbs for poisons, only vendor mats.
---
They'll be removed in Phase 2.
---
There is a bug in conjuring food and water that cause the DDoS
---
You are the root cause! Hahahaha
---
Think I got this already gotta look
---
Fine, but that should be *their* burden to bear, not ours. That would translate to refunds, but nope, they make it *our* burden to bear. If it were free that would be one thing. As soon as you start charging money, *you* have to take financial responsibility for an inability to deliver whether it's preventable or not.
---
Reserved loot is a dick move. You don't deserve loot more than anyone else. You just want to rig it in your favor.
---
About two months ago I was arguing with a ton of people with this exact argument. I got downvoted consistently.
---
I mean he's a streamer, the best thing to have done would have not given them any attention at all. If he's not good enough to get the gold the regular way then just ignore and move on.
---
BoEs were always "everyone need" in Vanilla. There was always someone who was gonna ninja if everyone chose greed. It's a BoE, it's not even considered a ninja tbh.
---
I know people don't like to hear this, but it is what it is. Everyone needs then the winner decides what to do with the item.
---
I understand the point that people would prefer that BoEs would be treated the same as BoPs, but that can't happen because the AH exists.
---
Be on the safe side.
---
That's not comparable.  Cookies wand is a BoP.
---
they're ddosing the isp but okay
---
I even vacuumed and did laundry
---
That was hilarious. It's satire he's being funny and it's funny.
---
congrats dude! I dumped my whole week playing it
---
It kinda does though. Just that it needs some time is what they don't understand.
---
No group, you damage mob and he kills it.
---
Donno if priest has any AoE spells, if not you could use some low level engineering bombs
---
Good.
---
Indecisive
---
Wait, horde has 2 un'goros? OP
---
why the sudden rise in WOW anyways, what caused it to be so popular all of a sudden? Or was it always this popular?
---
I'd just go min/eng from the start. You'll make money from just questing and hunters really don't need their mount immediately at 40 anyway. Cheetah is nuts.
---
Lmfao
---
I think your pets were born in the wrong bodies. They are the reverse of what they should be
---
Yeah, people who DDoS video game servers should be taken, along with their families, to Guantanamo Bay and slowly tortured to death over several years. It's worse than rape and murder combined.
---
I meant addressed the fact that there haven't seemed to be layers since the start of the ddos attacks.
---
You are paying for played game time. It's just up to how many hours you log to determine the value of the time. Assuming you played every hour of every day for a 30 day month, you're paying $0.021 dollars per hour to play WoW. Since the average person is incapable of that figure without major negative drawbacks, we could use a much more conservative estimate of about 20 hours per week. Now you're paying $0.188 per hour for your subscription. This brings us to DDoS time, let's say it continues on a weekly basis in which people lose about 8 hours per weekend. Now you're paying $0.313 per hour. This, and things like the time spent to organize friend parties, are all cost of opportunity losses thanks to an asshat who can't do anything better with their life.
---
Yeah I was wondering if you were a wrestler
---
The absolute best thing about this is that if you look at the chat you can just make out our hero saying ‚Äúgod damn horde‚Äù before charging in
---
You poor fool
---
What a dumb idea.
---
Mhm
---
Prison is a terrible idea for a DDoS of a game. Prison should be reserved for murder, rape, and violent crime
---
So if I post an article on wowhead and link it does that make me right?
---
Mages are behind priests; they constantly have to drink after pulls. Priests have no downtime. Sure if you factor in aoe grinding mages would be better... but the vast majority of people don't aoe grind from 20something to 60 so that's not really relevant... what's the point of a tier list if it only discusses things the top 1% of players will do? Not very useful for the majority
---
edit: that guy has priests as the third worst class to level? Yeah I'll have what he's smoking, lmfao
---
Questie, Leatrix Maps, QuestlogEx, RealMobHealth, Bagnon are essential for me.
---
The rest are just preference.
---
WINDOWS+SHIFT+S
---
Seriously.
---
That's the best policy.
---
A tip if this were to happen again, dont release. When the boat goes into a loadingscreen you get revived on the other side.
---
From my understanding of the post about them invading SW they're a Taiwanese guild.
---
not that I remember, but you could do a few runs of WC if you're horde or deadmines if you're alliance, they both have a lot of amazingly good gear for rogues at that level
---
I don't mean the actual message, i just want spells to be used when i click them. So if i press ice block i do ice block, i don't have to dismount before i can do it.
---
Name dropped my server.   Damn,  feelsgoodman.   Didnt think blaumeux was even on the map lol
---
You can't fall behind unless you are in a dedicated dungeon/raid group........
---
Well, that's a lot better than usual
---
You can‚Äôt comprehend my last post due to all the brain washing reddit is doing to you. They can stop a ddos if they wanted to, just like how the cure to cancer has already been found. Corporate greed is the only limiting factor
---
Had someone do this while we were running to SFK once apparently, dude came out of down below and was popping off
---
Oh man what will he do without you?
---
For sure it‚Äôs okay
---
Is that on an Acer nitro? Same computer here.
---
Wow classic launched a bit over a week ago.
---
DISCLAIMER! I invented Bass boosting and I was 10 at the time, enjoy.
---
You barely use mana cause you‚Äôre gonna be in form. Hunter is the fastest leveling class, Druid is 2nd and warlock is 3rd. Druid level crazy easy, they just have oom issues from lvl 1-10 then you get bear form and it‚Äôs easy mode. Then once you get cat and travel form, you‚Äôre moving from mob to mob super fast, killing them fast, have self heals and can run away from anything faster then it can chase.
---
Selling weapons in clasic WoW is the worst. That AH deposit is huge, and you have that feeling it's just going to be wasted. So you're torn between wasting your time (and bag space) spamming 2/ with your wares, and just vendoring it and getting back to the grind for more xp and loot.
---
Well its not a frostbolt spam yes and sometimes you have to create a soulstone/healthstone.
---
It looks like more but its instant cast so in the end push 3 buttons at once and play your guitar. While other classes just spam one button
---
Word of Might I believe. From Paladins
---
Hunters, warlocks, classes with pets. Pets make the game infinitely easier.
---
Already died at least once because the game rather say "You are mounted" Instead of doing the clutch ice block or barrier that i needed
---
Happened to me today. Delaying my visit to the trainer as much as possible.
---
I imagine he uses them the same way Thor uses his hammer to fly.
---
To avoid over healing like u/ClosertothesunNA said!
---
Also depends on your mana and mp5. After you cast a spell you don't regen any Mana for 5 seconds.
---
If Heal will get your target back to good health without over healing why spend the extra Mana? Plus Heal has a quicker cast time, meaning you get them that good stuff quicker!
---
Yes actually, I have noticed this as well
---
Yes, that's the whole point, and as long as I'm up front about it you have no reason to be upset you absolute child
---
Dude, u joking?  Interface option, then social tab.  Just block those bitches right then and there with 'block channel invites'.  You never have to deal with the pop-up again.
---
I'll krump with you sweetie pie!
---
You'll likely need to step it up... Did you pick up gathering professions as you've leveled? If not, I highly recommend it... Skinning has paid off very well for me and allowed me to get my mount at 40.
---
Does Conjured food and water disappear when you log off? I got my first stack today as a gift from a random mage I saved from dying but I didn't use the them before logging off. I even used my own food first because I wanted to save the new and better food for later.
---
Which is why anyone who opens up with "I'm a professional IT, etc." is lying their fucking ass off lmao.
---
Nice two hearted shirt!
---
Horde outnumbers alliance 2 to 1 on some pvp servers, if you wanted to world pvp is easy to see which side gives you more opportunity.
---
The purpose of need and greed works perfectly fine for BOPs, that's what it's for. So people can communicate what's an upgrade for them and what would be vendor trash (with a value so low that it *almost* doesn't matter).
---
But when we are talking about BOE's that can go for several 100 gold then YOU are just robbing people of a small fortune, you hold them hostage just because you can wear the item. Granted, in this case it was a shitty blue item of little value, but I can guarantee you that the majority of players won't pass on that Freezing Band because Frank the Frost Mage is in the group. Not when they could craft an entire set of gear with the gold earned from the auction.
---
Thanks for the update. I will be very angry now.
---
As someone who never got into it originally, but was curious enough to subscribe for a bit, it's nice to not be so utterly complacent in an MMO. Everything can kill you (though, as far as I can glean, this might just be a warrior problem). It's really nice feeling like the roads serve a fuinctional purpose because there's no insta-teleport fast travel from the word go. You find people travelling, you see the world moving around you, and the element of danger persists from A to B. Even the bat rides actually exist in the world and don't feel 'gamey'. MMOs got various things wrong, and fast travel was a major one.
---
Having come from Shadowbane, and found everything thereafter incomprehensibly boring, I'm reserving my judgements on the PVP and build variety.
---
That said, prepare to collect a lot of bear arses.
---
So by that logic you could just go outside and do things that don't involve staying in your house and eating the food you already paid for. Just read outside, go for a run, eat out and enjoy someone else's company.
---
There's no real damage that I caused. It was a minor inconvenience. /s
---
any good addons for quest dialogue? i have adhd so breaking up the text helps a lot
---
If trolls looked like this I'd play one. It looks like the real thing but also looks better at the same time. 
---
Goddamn awesome stuff
---
Anything that tells you what an items vendor sell price is.
---
Mail to bank alt, forget it exists... profit?
---
There are literally services for this. Any teenage cum stain who stole his parents' credit card can do it. I'd say this is a step or two *below* being a script-kiddie, which I didn't think was possible.
---
Lol OP are you 12?
---
I don't know the details haven't asked about his spec, just found it funny that he does it this way and only told it because OP was insecure about his spec.
---
All I was trying to do.is convey that it doesn't really matter while you're.lvling... Going raiding however I think he'll get more serious or I guess we won't even bring him, or maybe by some longshot it's viable(I doubt it though), we'll see.
---
Sounds about right
---
Besides the usual don't train skills you don't need and don't waste money buying gear on the auction house: Grind basilisks and other beasts in desolace. The grey drops alone vendor for a lot. Throw skinning on top of this and you'll have your mount by 40 no problem. Your gold earning potential takes a major upswing around 35, so sitting on 22g at 31 isn't a bad place to be.
---
You Look like one of them morally grey quest givers that will ask me to poison someone's dog in hillsbrad foothills to 'test an elixir'
---
The fact people are mad online and care one way or the other about what a streamer is doing is far sadder than what the streamer is actually doing.
---
... in my pants  
---
This really never happens you can take my word
---
I won't apologize, that's just absurd
---
&gt; iT's jUsT a PrAnK bRo
---
Ok lol
---
Cloudflare does a decent job
---
Why waste a Rschaman on twisting totems? That's how people die, which is a much bigger dps hit.
---
I still suggest getting most normal leveling talents, but I would pick up the wand damage talent. Save Mana for healing and use SW Pain and wanding to help deal damage. You'll want to respec at 60 for more focused healing anyways, but while leveling the damage does make a difference.
---
Follow is disabled in bgs so you won‚Äôt find multiboxers in there
---
1-2 hours a day spread over a month amounts to quite a bit of time. You just need to look at your current entertainment expenses and see if this is something that could replace something else. 
---
For me $15 is well worth the time I put into, and the enjoyment I get from the game.
---
South shore on kritonos?
---
And adds a decent amount of latency to boot.
---
Ahhhhhh okay that's actually really cool
---
Best thing about undead is cannibalizing all alliance corpses. Best taunt ever.
---
If your good it's not a problem
---
Well they made what they normally make + 38 dollars it seems
---
Im beginning to see this as well and it makes me sad...
---
Aggro management is still relevant in mid-high Mythic + keys on Retail when you have (particularly) melee classes doing insane amounts of burst damage.
---
Especially if it's a skittish week.
---
I see. Thank you!
---
It is most certainly a logical reason. Its reasoning takes some emotional factors as its premises, but is nevertheless rational based on those premises
---
Good way to loose players Yeah great idea
---
A month is excessive. They might credit all active accounts with 2 days though.  I think they‚Äôve done that in the past.
---
Bagels, you numpty.
---
It's also something quite chill to do while waiting for people to get ready
---
Ooh yeah I forgot about the fucking twink hunters at 19!
---
Yeah 60 tusks.. some of those bitches only have one. You're talking between 40-50 quillboard dead. That's like two entire villages.
---
Just keep suckin' and fuckin' until you've got that mount bro.
---
bro üòéüí™
---
lol FUCK OCE amirite
---
Had a similar thing happen to me yesterday. I was flying to badlands from the horde camp in stranglethorn and I got dc‚Äôd while I was flying over elwynn forest and logged back in to my character landed in the river deep into enemy territory. Decided to make the most of it and walked to swamp of sorrow for a flight path.
---
&gt; sad that some ppl can't figure out the diffence from Taiwanese and Chinese

TAIWAN NUMBA ONE!!!!
---
Where do I go as a level 30 mage? Any dungeons I can spam with others to level up fast? I actually enjoy AoE farming much more than questing to be honest. It's pretty tiring to go back and forth in a certain area as a mage. I'm a fairly new to WoW and just started in BfA. All the other MMOs I have played back in the days didn't really have that much quests. Everything else was just constant mob grinding so that might explain why I'm loving AoE farming above everything else.
---
Org to thunder bluff is usually 50copper
---
How's rattlegore? At work atm.
---
Layer shifts only happen when you log in or when you join a party with a person from another layer.  This was not a layer shift.
---
No. Then it would classic.
---
Words evolve, so their definitions are prone to become as inaccurate as the people misusing them.
---
Yeah I did that in vanilla on my 30~ mage and have a screenshot of it somewhere, so it's true to the original experience.
---
not just any 2 days. 2 days of the weekend - where everyone has time to play.
---
Might have to grind some
---
If I am not planning on dieing I will soulstone other players, the ultimate buff in the game.
---
This is wrong information, not a great comment. Please don't think that's how it works because it's completely inaccurate. See the other replies.
---
So what you‚Äôre saying is asmongold did it

It's superior on mobile too.

Sorry for such an utterly shitpost but I thought it was funny :)
---
TBC. WotLK is when dungeons turned into AoE spam fests and continuous pulls
---
Yeah I have skinning and leather working, but I mostly vendor whatever I make so it helps lol
---
HealFoReal
---
Definitely not vanilla lol.
---
Would you like to think youre the first one who thought this?
---
It's hard to find that right balance. WotLK was the most popular expansion but it had quite a few "conveniences" that I was not happy with because to me it was very obvious the direction the game was heading. And then Cataclysm leaks confirmed that things were getting worse not better.
---
Even still, WotLK was mostly enjoyable and you can trace a lot of those design philosophies back to BC when the term "welfare epics" was coined. But I love BC and it was still a very grindy game without an obscene amount of convenience. To me it was a natural progression from Vanilla, which itself was a natural progression from EQ.
---
As much as I and others hate on retail, it's hard to look at a singular change in a vacuum and say "No, adding 1 extra portal will erode the integrity of the game."

Go to 1k needles and do the shimmering flats, have done ashenvale and stonetalon?
---
Yes. Take the OSRS approach
---
RuneScape nerd here, is a twink basically a low level pure who abuses level brackets?

I find it amazing that an ancient game by design allows unique experiences to happen. The world has a sense of wonder and adventure, something that retail WoW has been missing for a very long time. Each playing session has the potential to turn into something memorable, regardless of what you're doing. 
---
It's just fun seeing people having fun.

Even if you discount the doxxing, he stated himself on his own twitter that he's using stressor websites.

You could literally make the argument he's not even a script kiddy- He just did the DDoS equivalent of going to Amazon and ordering a DDoS with 1 day shipping. Instead of a script kiddie, more like a shopping cart toddler.

Yeah, I want Zul Gurub and Naxxramas, as well as Alterac Valley.

60/40 is 50% more horde than alliance you know.

In classic debuff slots on target are limited to 16 in a raid environment so cats bleed are most of the times forbidden because of the limitations. So you won‚Äôt apply bleed in raid :/ And to be honest it‚Äôs a dps loss to apply bleeds in cat form. All you want to do it‚Äôs to claw and ferocious bite at 5 cp with manual crowd pommeler (lot of them is required to be competitive)

With leatrix plus, there's an option to auto stand/dismount if that's preventing you from using an ability. If you ice block or anything wiser while mounted, it will dismount you with no error message and then you can tap the ability again and it will go off.

Kk thank you, same kind of area then(:

You are a fucking idiot.

You‚Äôll be fine for stv the start of nesingwary, could always hit up Desolace 32-34ish

goddam misinformation. oh well close enough.

Low lvl items are still worth hundreds of gold. Last night I ran SFK for the first time, shadowfang dropped and we agreed to all roll need on it. I won it and even though I‚Äôm a rogue 400g &gt; a few levels with BiS. All of these people are talking about utility, but I find it completely stupid to equip an item such as shadowfang to only utilize it for a few levels, when I can sell it to a lvl 19 twink who will utilize the item for the longevity of that character.
---
A mob 3 levels high. And watching HS.  That's the issue.
---
My guild has a black list already started for shits like this, no way are we going to trust them for raids and high end dungeons.
---
As the servers population drops I hope they get left in the dust.
---
lol that's why I asked people their opinions, I was curious what they thought. also, bagels of course.
---
I want Karazhan
---
purpose in life is all subjective.
---
This is not correct. For 3 people to roll the same number once the probability is (1/100)\*(1/100). There's a 1/100 chance for the 2nd person to roll whatever the first person rolled and, similarly, there's a 1/100 chance for the 3rd person to roll it as well. Both are independent events so you just multiply.
---
For this to happen twice, again it's independent, so we multiply the probability of each occurrence: ((1/100)\*(1/100))\*((1/100)\*(1/100)) = (1/100)\^4 = 1.0e-8.

This isnt about bop items purely boe. There is a middle ground that is better for everybody. Its greedy to roll on upgrades expecting to get it purely becease you can use it and nobody else can. Its greedy to need on items bop for the vendor price. 
---
The reasonable and common practice is boes that are worth gold everybody needs, it goes randomly to everybody in the group. Bop are need for upgrades and greed for vendor disenchant.

Updated with oceanic realms

Servers weren‚Äôt at 50-75k back in the day. Tops of 10k per server.
---
it isnt. google 1-300 engi classic wow and you will find a list of everything you need, then you can go to AH check the prices.
---
right now with the servers fresh, everything is cheaper. what I did what buy most of the stuff I need (im lvl 53) to lvl 1-300 and let it stored ob my mail. the thorium bars (or ores) are the expensive part and dense stones a bit, the rest should be like 50g total or something on skeram rn.

Tbh it's a pretty fucked he spends too much time playing. I frequent r/relationship_advice (which means I'm an expert in telling someone to break up with their SO) and this situation seems like it's spinning out of control.

Well no. If the item was meant to just be worn, it would be bop.

Since the item is boe, it is meant to be traded.

Maybe it's particularly bad ATM because all the fun people are here having fun? I dunno. Sure am glad to be enjoying wow again though :).
---
What should I be saving gold for beside my epic mount in phase 1?
---
A shit one.
---
Except it'll be at least 6 months to a year before the item even has that value. The greed button is there for people who want a profit. If the group sets out ahead of time with loot rules for BOE items then by all means everyone should roll need.
---
Your parents related by any chance?
---
The real bitches are people like you for shilling for activision and layering. The obvious solution was to not have layering (completely ruins the vanilla wow community) and instead launch the game with many more servers. It's not a big deal to merge servers down the track.
---
You're the perfect example of a retail kid playing classic wow, get the fuck back to BFA.
---
Cannot get atlas loot classic to work any ideas? If you use it that is.

Downloaded from 3 different sources. Have atlas installed and atlas maps. But loot won‚Äôt work.

Shower what madness is that.

Eh that's not fair. WoW is an incredibly addicting game that is built to be just that. It sounds like this woman is genuinely upset about the fact that she's being neglected and that probably feels shitty.
---
I believe the Horde is in the presence of our king, Lord Varian Wrynn.
---
I do. Unless they don't give the tank time for threat. I'll let their health get low to hopefully scare them into backing off unless they won't listen. Then they die.
---
That's not the macro we're talking about?
---
No, their attacking the ISP, not the blizzard servers.

Came across this today as well. It really made me feel sad for a moment seeing that 2005 memorial and realizing this person has passed away 14 years ago and there I stood looking at his memorial.
---
TFW your the weekend shift guy =^)
---
The layers are a temporary thing. They need 1 layer for phase 2, so reputation will certainly matter.
---
I like the Alliance questing areas from 1-25ish. They are well put together but I like the horde community more. I also like the racials a bit more on the horde side. Sure Durotar, the barrens, trisfal, and silverpine are meh but we have we have some nice easy access to a couple awesome dungeons.
---
Another problem was they didn't make the world large enough to support many cities. To give an idea of scale, Goldshire is supposed to have a population of 7000 and I read that it's supposed to take a few days to journey from it to Stormwind on foot.
---
Makes sense they would scale the world down, but it does limit the number of cities you can end up putting into the game.
---
Bruh you are either high or think blizzard has an sjw/pc mindset, they don't.
---
This is because the Alliance has been blocking Horde access to the good resources. The orcs just want to build their own place in unsettled Durotar. The tauren want to live free from being hunted by the centaur. The Darkspear trolls want nothing to do with the old troll empires and just want peace. The Forsaken just want to be left alone and maybe see their living family in the Alliance again
---
But no, the Alliance won't have that. If it were up to them, the orcs would be back in concentration camps, the tauren would be left to be hunted to extinction, the Darkspear trolls would be treated the same as the Amani, and the Forsaken would be sent straight to Hel

Alt+Tab is essentially they same as Minimizing. You‚Äôre still leaving the game in some context to do another activity.

And why would your browser already be open? Unless you were already planning on doing something requiring the browser ahead of time. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen anyone keep a browser open ‚Äújust in case‚Äù.

In my own experiences, if someone needs to check something while gaming they just pull it up on their phone because it‚Äôs far faster.

Classic isn't Vanilla. Classic is meant to provide a *Vanilla like* experience. I for one am all for new content for Classic in the spirit of Vanilla.

My First line 
---
\&gt; The summoning stones aren't the problem.   It's what they became
---
Who is "you" and who is "other people"? The argument I laid out applies to everyone. Even those who could equip the item to increase their stats would level faster by selling. Since any party member could be "you" then who is left to make up these "other people"? Everyone is in the same situation.
---
you cant use "follow" in BGs which really throws a stick in their wheel. is that a saying? stick in wheel?
---
I was definitely not laughing at the time! Alliance everywhere and yeti were hard to come by. Had a good chuckle later on :)
---
I wanted him to get the ring, as AGI has no benefit to me. But he has already been rolling on pretty much everything by then.
---
Fuck I actually laughed, I guess I‚Äôm a wow nerd now
---
WotLK was the start of a lot of the stuff that ended up being what people complain about but honestly the implementation in WotLk itself wasn't bad yet.
---
with hindsight we can see the issues started here but it wasn't a problem here with very few exceptions. and the exceptions don't reach a higher level than issues that would be expected at any point in wows history.
---
It's called hyperbole. It's a rhetorical flourish, and it's literally been around forever.
---
Thank god for sandbox mode in Win10.
---
That only works if there's a guarantee that the person who needs it, actually uses it. Guild runs use that type of system, pick up groups it should really be need on all valuable boes, recipes etc.
---
I was talking about another post, but ok....

My ego isn't hurt. Don't think that I'm insecure about misposting, because I'm not its all a joke and I meant everything and nothing.

classic wow alliance pov edition
---
Right? #nochanges, though it could have been something that Blizz wanted to remove from the get-go.
---
In terms of convenience and speed, I prefer alliance (not night elves) you can go from 1-30 in 4 adjacent zones (elwynn - westfall - redridge - duskwood) as long as you‚Äôre willing to grind a bit. (Otherwise you gotta go to the wetlands or maybe the loch)
---
In terms of atmosphere I prefer the horde.  I think it‚Äôs totally from my playing wc3 thrall campaign, but seeing the harpies, quillboar, centaur, and eventually making your way to ashenvale was, for me, very inspiring and beautiful.  Not to mention the legion remnants in ashenvale.  The memorial to grom...
---
That being said the horde barrens 10-24 or so can be incredibly monotonous and takes me much longer than it does when I play alliance.
---
I‚Äôve heard it starts with phase 2, but there was no official post linked with that comment.
---
What do I know, I'm Canadian. We just apologize prople into submission
---
it's location was. you couldn't get through the bubble.
---
we had years of wondering what exactly was going on in Dalaran untill WotLk came out. it was part of the reason it was such a big deal.
---
Check out the classic warrior discord, but early on, you will want to cycle taunt and sunder armor as your main threat generator. Also, don‚Äôt stress when someone yanks Aggro off you, sometimes dps hit too early or healer heals too early
---
Did you mean skinning/LW is not that useful?

---
GMs would literally never enforce player-made loot rules lmao. They only enforced accidental looting.
---
What happens in your fairytale situation is that a really expensive boe drops, you roll need because that is what you believe i guess, and everyone else rolls need.
---
Or even everyone rolls greed and then one person rolls need. They get their epic mount, you get nothing but trying to spam their name in trade.
---
Only pull one mob at a time. This is classic. You can‚Äôt really pull more then one mob unless you are in a group or the mobs are lower level.
---
Opposite for me
---
It's for classic, maybe my anti virus is messing with it? I might try to reinstall WoW and see if that fixes it, ty for the help. I was just seeing if anyone else had this problem, but it looks like it's just me, lol
---
Yelp for old people

I hope the OP saw this, that 'helm' needs to be addressed!

Bruh you are dumb af. You obviously have no idea what greifing is. Killing someone on a pvp server is not greifing. You could kill that guy over and over for 6 hours straight and still blizz would just laugh. What planet do you live on?

if $15 is a lot of money for you and you're not a kid spending your limited pocket money, then you probably shouldnt play.
---
My knowledge in internet routing is not deep enough to be 100% sure of all the reasons but having millions of whitelisted IPs (and many people are running dynamic IPs that change regularly) would require a lot of processing power on the switches.
---
I hope this fucker steps on a lego. No, 2 legos.
---
thats chill. I played a priest in vanilla and now a warrior in classic. I feel like tanking sucks ass compared to healing so i just switched to dps. sometimes i pull aggro while cleaving but i try and manage my threat. sometimes i get them huge crits and there is nothing i can do. also i try and off tank when the healer or squishy dps gets agro. I figure its better i, a mail user, get attacked then a clothie or leather bro.
---
Some one bought food and water from me on Myzreal for 1g in the Barrens last week. Then my friend told me it disappears after I log out not the person holding the item. I felt bad for the guy but didnt remember his name.

Sorry but if you are literally dumb enough to equip that much gold to your character that will be replaced in 2 levels, I honestly just don't care what you(the hypothetical person) thinks.
---
and they say the horde has no honor
---
well he declined the one trade I saw that was 10s but took the 1g trade. I had to nope out of that stream when I heard him say that though.

This is both amazing and cursed

You lost me at firewall configs and "certain software"...... This would in no way help prevent a DDoS attack.

---
Warlocks dont have a cooldown on fear so they can just cast it again. No matter what you do you will spend less time fighting other players than fighting mobs so dont change anything that is good for leveling. You will take longer to level if you focus on being able to kill players instead.
---
That‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm saying.  Classic is a rehashing of the vanilla experience.  The servers being down and full and generally unreliable, and all the inconveniences that come with that, are bringing this launch closer to the first launch than it think blizz wanted to get...  lol
---
Cloaks only difference is mp5, only difference from wrists is 10 fr. Both of these have the same +shadow dmg. 
---
There are no maru quests that give a better ring than listed unless you count a garbage green +9 int +5 stam ring better.
---
I will give you rosevine or rosewine band what ever its called from lbrs but its still debatable because you lose varied amounts of int/spirit for varying amounts spell power and low mp5(which isnt a stat that is a need for warlocks at all).
---
I would give him some gold, I enjoy watching his stream, he also has some good insight on how the game works... Don't be bitter because you don't have the same options.
---
That's "should have", which the previous comment specifically went out of their way to promote.
---
I was questing in ashenvale on my gnome mage the other day and a group of 5 taurens came up and stood in a circle like that around me, i whacked one of them in the face with my staff and they all ran away.
---
No, but looking at your post history proves that those who throw stones live in glass houses my man.
---
As 1 of the thousands of players who has grown up and has almost no time to play due to adult responsibilities, this is really frustrating.....
---
I mean that's an honorable position to have, but when you get an epic/rare boe drop worth a lot of gold, you are going to be ninja'd. That's just how its going to be.
---
You should roll need because you know most people are going to also roll need.

---
Not looking for your sob story. Man up and fight or hide behind the internet
---
The faction balance will only get worse over time.  The more people that leave Alliance, the worse it will seem and cause even more people to leave, snowball effect etc.  Phase 2 will be brutal for Alliance and I expect their population to plummet there, but phase 3 should be good when it's all instanced PvP and Horde have enormous queue times (even cross server BGs won't help that as Horde outnumber Alliance by a large margin throughout all of Classic).
---
Basically suffer through Phase 2 so you can have instant BG queues and AV auto wins in Phase 3.
---
It's about even I believe. More active alliance, but Horde has more level 1 characters.
---
Yeah keep browsing buddy, hope you find something you like in there.

Yes lol
---
The dude is begging for gold from viewers that already pay his twitch salary.
---
Appreciate it. Ashenvale or any other recommendations?
---
It's actually great endgame, Alchemists are always in demand for raid flasks etc. However, many hardcore raiding guilds have dedicated tradesmen for each profession. Decent money but it varies based on demand. Also transmuting is insanely useful and you can sell your CD for a quick buck too.
---
I guess I would anticipate less hardcore raid content and more community driven or quality of life content.  Thinking events that add incentive for city attacks or dungeons that fill gaps during leveling.
---
Ok?
---
Herp fucking derp.
---
Yeah, I know it was something negligible. Point is they aren't rare, they were the first thing I bought

---
Stop making ddos posts that glorify the attackers. Yall are dumb af like the mainstream news glorifying school shooters. STOP, JUST FUCKING STOP TALKING ABOUT THEM AND THEY WILL GO AWAY. This is what they want, they want you to talk about them, this is what they get off on. Stfu!
---
For sure, raiders are going to need boatloads of elixirs/potions/flasks/etc. and they're usually willing to pay handsomely for them
---
So its not anus?
---
LeROOOOOOOOOOYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!
---
Yes this is much easier
---
reeeeee he doesn't give me his undivided attention
---
I thought my post suggested that people giving gold ruins classic, what gave you the idea I want the gold?
---
Alchemy is great. People always need pots and flasks. Flasks may be hard to get though. Recipes are pretty rare and the mats aren't always easy to farm.
---
But health and Mana pots will always be chugged.
---
The 1 stacks in the AH are the idiots who don't know how to use their AH addons properly, don't be like them, it makes the AH a nightmare to browse. Sell in 20 or 10.
---
It is literally nothing like what anything they do lmao
---
Huh? Do you think I'm on your server hiding from you?
---
Yeah, all paladins ever do is gank me and then bubble hearth while cackling if it looks like I'm gonna win. Fuck paladins.
---
I thought BestinSlahtz were only patched on Retail, and only recently..?
---
That's kind of the grand experiment of WoW Classic and OSRS though, isn't it? 
---
I've heard the term "pain points" thrown around in game design discussions a lot, particularly with board games. 
---
A pain point is really anything that causes a player to feel annoyed, inconvenienced, or in extreme cases, enraged. 
---
Modern game design generally views pain points as a flaw. A good modern game designer should remove as many pain points as possible. 
---
I think that's the zeitgeist that gets us BfA. 
---
Finding nice gear is too hard? Make blues and purples more common. 
---
Travel takes too long? Add convenient portals everywhere. 
---
Gold's hard to come by and you feel broke? Add a cash shop 
---
Which is interesting, because by making the game as painless as possible, they made it sterile, which made people yearn for Vanilla/Classic. Inarguably a more painful game, but here we are, waiting in queues for a game no modern AAA game publisher would ship. 
---
I think you're onto something by saying that it's hard to look at single changes, and identify those as issues or not. It's the sum total, not any individual change.
---
You could try deleting it and use twitch to install it for you, otherwise I have no clue
---
And on top of that I've left groups where there's assholes who clearly aren't making an effort to get to the instance. There's so many groups for dungeons that it's quicker to find a new one that's ready than it is to wait for the lollygager
---
What server you. Ill come find you
---
So uncivilized.
---
Alchemy is good, you'll always need potions to chug as you're leveling to avoid a death.
---
The herbs can be put on the AH for good coin if you want to turn a profit.
---
Endgame you can make some amazing flasks which give crazy abilities like +2k mana for an hour, making them almost essential for raids.
---
I also remember that various potions like Greater Fire Protection were HEAVILY farmed in vanilla due to the endgame raids being mostly fire, and every guild would have stacks ready.
---
If WoW is under a DDoS attack it has nothing to do with servers being full and unreliable.  Folks need to start using the proper definitions for terms like DDoS.... If they are under attack that is one thing, server configs and specs are completely different animal.
---
for more expensive stuff like flasks I would to 1 at a time, but for food I'd go full stacks
---
Unaware of what that is. I‚Äôm sure this quote is implemented, based on your response. However this quote originated from an audio recording of a ventriloquist during vanilla, on an UBRS run.
---
Herod feels the same. I don't think there's  anything can be done really.

Cape? It's all about the cruel barb let's be honest...
---
How does giving gold to one streamer ruin classic for anyone. You sound like a bitch.
---
Hopefully the DDOS attacks will stop now.
---
If the group is full, I'll always wait, but if someone is clearly wasting everyone else's time I'd just replace them.
---
I mean its not just my opinion. If you want to roll greed on every boe that drops, you can do that.
---
But you are either passing to a full party of 4 others who need it or you are just giving free gold to a ninja.
---
And yet you‚Äôre the one who gets downvoted, lmao.
---
You choose weird hills to die on.
---
Rage if you want, blocked. &lt;3
---
Were you trying to contradict my argument? If so I don't see how this is relevant.
---
So far as I am aware my argument applies to all leveling toons unless they have so much gold from somewhere that the amount they get from selling the item doesn't help them level faster. In fact the poorer you are the more the gold from selling will help you level. So my argument works even better for you.
---
Unit
---
Not like you can‚Äôt purchase DDoS attacks
---
ooooo i wasnt super informed, which ones are getting hit?
---
Either find a therapist or go roll the faction that actually gets to wpvp to get that aggression out of your system.
---
Alien Egg as well :p
---
Somebody
---
No real difference as long as the price is the same, but people generally buy in stacks of 20 for convenience.
---
U look hot :o
---
Still running with level 30 robe of frozen wrath as a troll. It looks like the robe on trolls in ZF and ST :)
---
What is more ridiculous is that we are talking about him.
---
The problem here is that there's at least 3 different ways to interpret /u/RoccomGG's question. Does he mean:
---
1. Person A rolls X, person B rolls X, person C rolls X. Person A rolls Y, person B rolls Y, person C rolls Y.
---
2. Person A rolls X, person B rolls Y, person C rolls Z. Person A rolls X, person B rolls Y, person C rolls Z.
---
3. Person A rolls X, person B rolls X, person C rolls X. Person A rolls X, person B rolls X, person C rolls X.
---
Yours is probably what he means (meaning option 1), but the question is rather ambiguous.
---
Multiboxing is allowed

As a shaman I just do random heals and res any bodies I see. I dont feel incredibly useful to strangers unless I res them, in which case they thank me profusely. Which is really nice. The health ball thing I got from a warlock was a kind gesture!
---
Dress as a mage and they come to you! genius.
---
You are an unemployed uneducated loser so why are you trying to speak for network admins?
---
I did have this issue (empty loot window) at Feathermoon today, but fishing was fine at Steamweedle Port and Booty Bay, so maybe it is localized to specific areas.
---
Its definitely getting close to a ban. You can't have that sort of cross faction interaction in game.
---
The prices are so low for some things that it makes me wonder if buying it all and saving it in the bank would be worth it for a few more months down the line.

---
Don't be surprised when you get blacklisted from every major guild group on your server and have to reroll or group woth other ninjas exclusively lmao
---
cats like warm things, how groundbreaking.
---
Basically depending on class if you just gold farm at 60.  Roughly one hour of grinding per respec.  If you need to switch and then switch back in the same week for raids expect 2 hours of extra farm time just to cover that.  Of course you could be farming something else like Mats you need for something and also having gold drop kinda making it dual purpose grinding so it's not just 2 hour grind solely for the respecs.  Or 200 hours to level another toon to 60.  Whatever floats your boat.
---
He can beat off anytime, an open dps spot is limited
---
Definitely seems like you missed a zone or something. I would look into traveling into some other zone. Might die a few times but it‚Äôll be worth it
---
Dude you got ripped off! SW to westfall is 99c!
---
Natural language is almost always ambiguous. The ambiguity is resolved using context. In this context  it was pretty clear what he was asking.
---
In any case, the comment I was replying to not ambiguous, just wrong.
---
Shift+click the mail
---
Because these people know what they‚Äôre doing and how to stay anonymous and cover their tracks. If it was that easy to be caught no one would bother doing it or selling services to do so.
---
Also law enforcement probably doesn‚Äôt care enough to give all that effort to stop one attack.
---
Meanwhile in STV there are as many players as the quest mobs they are trying to kill. Hah
---
I leveled my priest with a warrior from 1-50 so far, never been out of a group with him and I'd say spirit tap is still worth taking. Without it you go oom pretty fast, just ask him t to switch off the mob &lt;5-10% so you can usually land the killing blow
---
Amen
---
You're ignoring the fact that mitigating attacks like this don't cost the company time and money.
---
I can totally agree but who cares if people decide to follow that. Every popular person ever takes advantage in some way. He happens to be an opinionated ass.
---
Bravo
---
Indeed, the alliance version is covered in shit and piss.
---
The thing about Classic is that you really can't stay in 1 zone from start to finish. When this problem happens you should look into going to another zone where you may be a little over leveled but you'll be able to speed through the quests and gain a few levels in the process.
---
You don't have to buy a mount, though you spend a lot of time not killing stuff and just moving around. 
---
Let's say instead you cash the blue in for 3 greens that give you better stats and use the rest to train so you have all the best abilities to kill stuff faster.
---
Only reason I survived as long as I did. PWS on CD ,fear,dot dot... Try and heal through the crying
---
cringe
---
The last part is such an odd concept. This rogue is days and days ahead of them in played time. He will remain ahead. When they get fresh 60 he will be in epics, a geared 60. They'll still be behind by a ton. He might still be able to 1v5 them.
---
Revenge makes sense when you won't be perpetually behind.
---
mage used to have invisibility in the beta... got taken out before release.
---
detect invisibility helps against invis pots... and as a dispell buffer.
---
so, near worthless.
---
Grobbulus, rp PVP. The people are amazing here!
---
No offense taken, and I was aware of the trade-offs when deciding I wanted the full set. I expect to do most of my leveling in dungeons, which further reduces the current need of a mount. I'm aware gear can be easily replaced while leveling, though I really wanted the extra hit along with a proper aesthetic. It's annoying missing so much as a warrior, even though its possible my overall dps would be lower due to the scarlet set. I'm currently playing around with a simulation spreadsheet.
---
I'm not sure those people exist
---
If only you could see my healing gear, I just can say my dwarf is ready to rock a Polka in Oktoberfest
---
Yeah absolutely. When the BGs come out there‚Äôs gonna be a huge market for a list of distinct items that are considered BiS for each BG. 
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a bad thing, it‚Äôs a fun metagame that doesn‚Äôt focus on raid/grind gates that pvp at 60 can do. 
---
Except the leg enchants ofc.
---
Sulfuras will have a 0 to 10minute que usually during 9pm EST to around 11pm EST.  Rarely is it 30 but it has happened.
---
Your reasoing is wrong, he didn‚Äôt end the fight at 0 mana, still had enough to cast a shadowbolt or two when he finished him off with wand.
---
Vote with shared sub with retail?
---
He wants to know what it‚Äôs like to have swat kick down his door and throw him in a rape dungeon for 20 years.
---
Your downloaded addons might have an extra layer of folders. If its something like ‚Äúexampleaddon-v2‚Äù open the folder and you should see a plain ‚Äúexampleaddon‚Äù folder, you want that one.
---
I will go into detail because you are spewing BS.......  For arguments sake lets assume Blizzard has a 10TB pipe with CenturyLink as their main and two other 10TB pipes (pick a carrier,, Verizon, ATT, whoever) for BC/DR purposes. 
---
They get hit with a DDoS attack targeting their "logon server DNS name" with a 50TB attack
---
Your firewall has to process every single request before dropping anything because its doing inspection, no firewall on the planet would be able to keep up with the requests, and in the end you are taking in more packets than your pipe can handle so it doesn't matter. Imagine you have a sink with a drain (this would be the 10TB carrier connection to Blizzard) with a firehose along with the normal faucet filling up the sink until it overflows because they drain can't keep up (this would be the DDoS attack).  
---
All you can do at this point is have your ISP drop the DDoS connections before they get to you or arrange for your data to flow through a service that has a bigger pipe via BGP routing. 
---
With this being the only Blizzard game having issues I doubt its a DDoS attack honestly.  If you are trying to say (like your last posts suggests) that they just have bad servers and the load is causing the issue its not a DDoS attack, its just piss poor configuration..... If you worked for an ISP you would know the difference between the two
---
I get it. It's just not funny.
---
Sorry I'm new to engineering. You sell all the items you make on the auction house? Or just the high level ones?
---
I try to drop water breathing on anyone I see if I'm not already occupied, occasionally even there is even water nearby as a bonus.
---
You can shift click mail to auto loot them, just like bodies.
---
I too saw a cherry picked video of shaman and thought it looked pretty cool. They nerfed windfury afterwards, but it was still fun. I just wish someone warned me how bad  shaman end game dps was. Videos can be very deceiving. 
---
Being forced to heal isn't always fun. I'm doing it again though because I still had a great time.
---
Wow always gets Ddos attacked every time something new comes out because trollers gunna troll

Are you PvE ? He's only attacking pvp my server rattle Gore went down at 2pm yesterday and I wasnt able to get online until 915am PST. Now at 230 I got kicked off during a library run and can't get back on, this is beyond stupid that one person with a botnet can take out an entire weekend of fun.
---
Kicked for no reason and told to KYS is unbelievable unless OP did something they're not talking about.
---
What‚Äôs your Venmo, I‚Äôll send you the 27 cents that you think you are entitled to.
---
Well there you go then.
---
And then use the revenue loss as damages when they catch this pos.
---
Not necessarily. Some salaried employees are not paid overtime on their salaries. It depends where you work.
---
Not abuses, it‚Äôs emergent gameplay basically, since each BG bracket has a cap for item gear.
---
Omg another cellphone pic. If you post a cellphone pic in 2019 you should be instantly banned from all of gaming. Seriously so fucking anoying.
---
Gee it‚Äôs almost like all of those companies have something in common that Blizzard doesn‚Äôt...
---
Work with interpol to stop a DDoS attack on Blizzard? Yeah they definitely don‚Äôt care enough for interpol to get involved.
---
At this point it‚Äôs on Blizzard to implement stronger DDoS protection.
---
I'm on Pagle btw...
---
I'm more likely to get a /spit then a buff. Even as I send my pet in to pull a mob off someone who overextended
---
Don't do it, many who transferred are complaining of dead servers.  It's a trap.
---
Nice, I have the sword/shield combo for the tanking set :) Alts are always fun, but you gotta focus on your main!
---
I need a hero
---
I'm sure it will run just fine. I'm playing on a dell xps 13 with 100 fps.

Grab the masstagger addon for reddit and take a gander at this subreddit.  Call is coming from inside the house.
---
This happened to me and it scared me.
---
Make sure you always have ample bag space and loot everything. As a warrior I was able to have 100 gold by level 41 by simply questing and vendoring items. If my inventory was full I use addons that showed me vendor prices to know what to trash.
---
Additionally, get auctionator and do an AH scan. Send any white items of value to your bank alt to sell.
---
Don't train abilities you absolutely don't need.
---
Thats the kind of player behind a pallie. Except retlols
---
Could just be your playing style. Learning how to kite mobs and keep your distance is going to be your money maker
---
Do you have Ice/Frost armor up?
---
Rattlegore here, had a que first 2 days of launch but lately no que, sit around medium to high most nights and can instantly get in.
---
There is no "faithful" way to add new content. Most players will hate whichever content is added, because you can't please everyone.
---
Definitely sounds like the name of one of those death metal bands with the [unreadable band logos](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2c/ae/09/2cae09d894d64b4b5985859c5b54cb4a.jpg)
---
Perfect! Im power leveling my LW now after following a guide and have almost all mats to get through it
---
The idea that anyone would kick a healer in a "standard" instance because of "parsing" is just laughable.  First, no one's fucking doing that nonsense.  And second, it takes longer to click through the menus.  Unless of course that player is either AFK or just downright terrible.  
---
Or, you know, making up a bunch of bullshit to farm clicks on reddit for some pathetic self validation.
---
It's only for whoever is holding it
---
Script kiddie back at it again
---
After I failed that quest 4 times, I finally did it today as a level 29... failed it on the first try because of how squishy he is
---
What add-on should I use to see instance / dungeon maps whilst inside the dungeon?
---
What is this subreddit becoming
---
absolutely. 
---
I think old timers are sniping the AH now, and the new players will soon learn what‚Äôs useful and start spending cash as they become more wealthy
---
Ahah yeah I keep getting really close to riding away but can never quite stick the landing
---
you idiots think anything ruins classic, as if people didn‚Äôt beg for gold for their mount in 2004. shut up
---
People been spamming this since day 1
---
Much love
---
Faerlina - can confirm its down. boyfriend and i d/ced at the same time
---
That's kinda gross
---
Pssh WMU has the best parties.
---
Well grinding to the limit as a warlock has a very high skill cap. Especially juggling 3 mobs a level or two higher than you.
---
nice save
---
Everyone trying to log in at the same time isn't helping the situation.
---
I always slow mobs and keep my distance, it was just in situations where I would get targeted by a mob when the group is doing an elite quest and I'd notice I would get close to zero significantly faster than the other mages and it didn't seem like they were using any items to restore health during the fight so I wasn't sure if I've been doing something wrong.
---
I've heard from sources. Without telling too much it's... significant. They severely underestimated the interest.
---
I'm sure there has to be ongoing conversations internally about how to carry Classic forward.
---
There's a lot of flexibility if you aren't soloing.  In the end though, you want to crutch on your wand either way.
---
Pick up wand damage, after that everything else is gravy.  For spirit tap you can just time a burst ability to finish things off(IE mind blast or smite at end).  Remember to downgrade spells as needed to save mana if you are having issues.
---
Get into the discord server he's on and start it anyway
---
Succubi
---
But it was deadmines and I don‚Äôt have feign death yet 
---
Otherwise yeah I‚Äôd blow it faster

Oh you know what I mean lol

A lot of the early novels are pretty entertaining and give you a sense of the history of the world https://wow.gamepedia.com/Novels

I've been listening to a few of them as audiobooks while I level
---
I am crashing a bunch. At least every 20 mins. Getting the following error message: https://imgur.com/a/FMJJlqQ

I have updated my graphics card driver and all addons. Can't figure out what the deal is. Anyone know or getting similar?
---
r/ihavephonesex
---
Exactly! Blizzard in the past said they wouldnt intervene except in extreme circumstances and I never saw it happen in all my time playing WoW. Basically if you dont like to be PvP'd dont play on the PVP server
---
They SHOULD not, but if they are rolling back the server they might be unmade.
---
I just throw a party invite but help them anyway.
---
Honestly I prefer to take the mob until the MT can pull it off because then I don't have someone else to heal. As a priest I can run to the tank and dump threat, making it easier for them to grab it off me. If someone off tanks it then the tank has to fight to get it back and I now have someone else to heal.
---
Honestly no, I didn‚Äôt even need skinning. 58-60 I healed a lot of dungeons including the mandatory strath live and undead (there‚Äôs like 10 quests for them) including the chains for ramstein and of love and family. You make a lot of gold spamming 5 man dungeons at max levels. 
---
Fishing I have farmed a lot of stonescale eels, oily black mouth and firefin snapper and of course dreamfoil is free to herb since there‚Äôs very few people at max level.
---
If you are meaning regenerating mana while in combat you will need to either buy mana potions from the auction house or level alchemy and make your own. 
---
If you‚Äôre talking about out of combat you just need to buy drinks from a vendor. Check any innkeeper and they will be able to sell you some or ask a mage
---
Such OP racials for a warrior, good switch. I wish you the best in leveling dude, I'm glad my post affected you positively. Be ready for the brutal grind!
---
Which addon is better in your opinion: BigWigs or Deadly Boss Mods?
---
My guild got changed too, Kingdom of Kupa Keep RIP
---
Go back in time 15 years ago and get the lifetime account like I did. It‚Äôs neat, you‚Äôll never have to pay for the sub, ever!
---
Too funny!
---
Your statement is stupid.  Can you attain AOTC or Gladiator from your phone? No.
---
You can't do that in classic either. 
---
You will afk in Stormwind waiting for Battlegrounds to pop from the Battle masters there all the same.
---
That was my first thought as well.
---
I did in detail in my other response.
---
I think everyone on this sub heavily overrated alchemy. Yes you can make potions and everyone wants potions, but you are not special because you have alchemy. Every guild and most people overall will have quite a few friends or guildies who can make potions, and most recipes for potion are fairly easy to get(except flasks which I will get to). Turning mats into potions is not very profitable at all, and turning the mats you farm into potions before selling might give a bit more but again people usually have friends to do this anyway.
---
Alchemy does give transmutes though, you can make about 4-5gold daily with this. And then there's flasks. There is 3 flasks that matters, hp mana and spellpower. They drop off bosses in 60 dungeons at a 1-2% droprate so they are quite expensive , anywhere from 300 to 1000 gold. With a flask recipe you can make some profit, but again anyone who has that flask recipe can do the exact same thing so there is competition. The good thing about flasks is that you can't just afk craft it in IF 24-7 with some scripts. You need to have cleared either part of scholomance or BWL when it comes out to craft flasks, but once you are there you can spam craft. 
---
I really wouldn't recommend alchemy unless if you are doing it to help a guild out or you have no other good options. It's a really nice profession for alts tho.
---
Water

Sometimes you want to set aside an hour or 2 and do a dungeon run.

/r/classicwowplus come on guys

Pick pocket and opening lockboxes.
---
Stacks are best

Head and shoulders.
---
Do you make more money with herbalism? Or was skinning making you some decent coin?
---
Pls be real.
---
no they‚Äôre all top comments because everyone on this site is a finnicky snarky moron 
---
Can you not read the picture in the OP? 
---
If you can‚Äôt get your fucking eyes checked 
---
Otherwise its all SPAM
---
Outside graphics suck, there arent even any cheats or hacks. :/
---
Is there a macro so I can shoot my wand while kiting and jumping around? Whenever I move it cancels my auto shoot
---
Same situation with late game. Consecration is a fantastic aggro holding tool. Plus they have Lay On Hands which, while a long cooldown, can be an absolute lifesaver in a big raid.
---
Anyone knows if +frost damage affects blizzard aswell. Or does it use a smaller modifier?
---
This is how it works in real life.   Stereotypes
---
I think they are from the shimmering flats area in TN.
---
What makes me go over the top with rage is that it is someone just being an asshole and causing this for zero reason. Idk why but that just IRKS ME
---
Is it possible to play WOW classic completly solo, and complete the hardest raids/dungeons/bossess (idn if raids are only for group of people, its my first time playing the game). If not, then how far do you think I can progress into the game?
---
üò¨
---
You need a sub
---
There won‚Äôt be any paid server transfers according to blizzard. I believe the ones that are being offered currently are the exception.
---
Just devilsaur yes. You might also want to save up if you plan on doing pvp.
---
lol. oh. ha, thanks.
---
Good luck with your search
---
I feel like you've just repeated what I said in my post, but in a more negative way. Maybe I just didnt word it very well, I'm sick today so my brain isn't really on point.

The problem is that lifedrain is ass and healthstones on such a cd and healers cant keep spamming you so... ya gotta use that wand baby

Are you using a macro for this?

So I went to gigabyte website to get the latest bios (currently F9) and the latest they have is f10b which is a beta bios. Am I screwed?

Just because you don‚Äôt own a cell phone doesn‚Äôt mean other people aren‚Äôt allowed to moron

2 things, you are WAY ahead of the curve being in Feralas already and Feralas really sucks so people avoid it. It isn't layering.
---
What server is this?   I want to friend that player
---
But these botnets are used in multiple attacks.
---
I want to roleplay casually on Horde. What‚Äôs seen less frequently, troll priest or forsaken priest? 
---
Semi-related but not to priests: What‚Äôs a good server to find roleplay on Horde? My Alliance are on Bloodsail, but the few times I‚Äôve checked, Orgrimmar looked empty compared to SW, and every Horde I‚Äôve passed while running around on my Alliance characters has had very immersion-breaking names.
---
What‚Äôs the add on that shows the vendor price?

 Can‚Äôt you just make a cast sequence macro and have the reset time whatever the CD on the skill in question is?

Well my guess is this guy wants us to fuck the guy doing the DDoSing, and then terminate him.

I love how he ends with "Catch up" like anyone could catch the idiot train he's on.

I hope that NE is on this sub and sees the number of people who think he was a dick and deserved what he got

For pick pocket? Absolutely, why press 2 buttons on every mob when I can press 1.

Buy a mage

I think it's getting worse. Alliance are so outnumbered and ganged up upon they are starting to reroll.
---
It‚Äôs been out for a week
---
Lol yeah, it really depends which way the wind is blowing that day. I started killing a warrior two levels or so below me and I realized I had already did him in once and he wasn‚Äôt fighting back. So I just polyd him and left.
---
Don't think that's true. Imagine they're all uniquely numbered balls and each time you take one out you put it back in. Probability of drawing the first one as 99? 1/100. Probability of drawing the second one as 99 given that the first was 99. Also 1/100. The fact that the first one was 99 does not decrease the probability to draw 99 again if you look at them as individual events. (1/100)(1/100) = 1/10000 if I'm not mistaken. I don't believe you need to use Bayes law in this case since there is replacement of the "balls".
---
7/11 is an indoor job! Everything fits!

just ask a mage for some water and make sure to tip them

And took the worst weapon from the whirlwind quest yikes!

heh i also switched sides to mix it up. it is hell

I feel the same way. I don't play, but I love the idea of classic wow. My first reaction that was one of confusion. Why the hell would anyone do this? What a bunch of douche-canoes
---
Playing a warlock as well and i found a good one, i give you the name tomorrow when i am back home, cant remember right now

BTW what server and faction

Stays the same. You‚Äôll get another 10% discount once you achieve R3 in phase 2.
---
My brother has little time to play but wants to do a mage. What would be a good class to play with him?
---
You can get to lvl 60 solo without issues.
---
If you want to do 5 man dungons or group with people on the way it is possible without needing to talk a lot or join a vocal server. As for the very end game with 40 man raids or high end PvP you will probably need a guild, or wait until the pve content becomes trivial and join groups doing it without communication .
---
Gettin real fuckin tired of this fuckin bullshit fam
---
His comment implies he made more with herbalism. The AH is much more appealing to herbs than leathers.
---
I still do skinning just because I‚Äôm not in the mood to dabble in the AH right now and would rather just vendor it all.
---
Is Artisan Skinning worth it if I plan to switch to Engineering eventually?
---
Recently became a solo parent, had to cut down on work hours, my department is closing down soon, daughter needs all new uniform to start high school, so yea, times arent the best, and classic will be a welcome escape atleast for this month. But it's all good, suns still shining.

They had him in Goldshire last week. All the lowbies would have been able to burn him down if he didn't keep resetting.

I can think of someone in a prominent position this doesn‚Äôt apply to.
---
On last boss of DM. Tank pulls before I was ready. When he pulled I quickly casted ward, HoT, and then start casting my big heal.
---
The boss does some spike damage and tears through the ward and HoT can‚Äôt keep up and he dies a split second before my big heal finishes about 5 seconds into the fight.
---
We got through the whole dungeon without and wipe and the first thing he says after the boss wipe is ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt even get a heal lol‚Äù
---
These people infuriate me...
---
Goddamn, thank you.
---
Paladin has a lot of cool buffs and they do a lot of single target crit heals
---
I know this DDOS is a total POS
---
Yeah, enjoy that negative honor trying to climb out and earn any real rewards
---
Well I mean we can just steal the healers mana with life tap
---
Ah dang I didn't know that :(  
---
Hope you can get one!
---
I wanted the Anduin sweater but its medium only -\_-
---
The more you allocate to servers in preventative form, the more resources you use. 1 uptick in an MMO in latency is huge. Now, normal operations aren't an enormous deal in a normal network. 
---
The combative measures requires enormous usage of bandwidth to detect each individual computer sending traffic. Multiply that by 1 million users. Now multiply that by a bother attacking. Good fucking luck.

---
Yes it's always accurate, vendor prices for items is well known.
---
All allies get one.
---
It's really not viable until very high level with the right gear and talents.
---
All jokes aside, I really hope you find what you're looking for. If not us heathens are pretty welcoming and friendly.

Not just Mankirk, but womankirk and childrenkirk as well
---
Classic is 1.13. Vanilla was 1.12
---
I just hope blizzard offers fucking transfers out of Faerlina to any other realms. 
---
Fuck this streamers bullshit
---
great, thats what I figures but I needed to be reassured.. Thanks buddy!
---
Um, may I suggest getting some additional bags?
---
Do they ever thank you? If I played on a PvP server and was a badass who safe people from ganks, I'd keep a folder of screenshots of whispers.
---
Oh please. Yeah let's all just say nothing about it because humans are not social creatures or anything.
---
About how long should a good SM library/arm run take at level?
---
Praise be unto RGBesus
---
Paladin/Shaman/Druid.
---
Mages cannot heal or tank, and any class that makes up for that shortcoming is good. Warriors are also really good, but without a heal you basically need to kill something before it kills you. 
---
As a mage you basically want to sit at the back and throw spells, if someone is attacking you then you're likely going to drop off the DPS in favor of surviving.
---
Come to the discord they‚Äôve been running the addons, can‚Äôt remember what the last one had them at
---
I‚Äôve seen many more friendly and nice encounters than encounters like this one. Unfortunately, there are always those types of people in gaming. They absolutely existed 15 years ago on release day.
---
That figure is before release.  Post-release puts estimates closer to 2:1.
---
Rip your inbox bro
---
Census addon will tell you your factions stats
---
Just to be pedantic, in local currency its closer to $1 a day, and I dont smoke and rarely drink, but maybe I can find money somewhere.
---
Kys?
---
You assumed I was arms, yikes!
---
Okay that's what I thought, thanks
---
Silly logic, if its boe blue, everyone needs it, you would be silly to use it in alot of cases, free easy money. there is at least a 99% chance that there is a better item in dungeons for you. BOE should never go to you just cause its an upgrade. imo.
---
I can‚Äôt wait till all these people are gone
---
Yeah what a sad setting to imagine
---
What kind of pussy helps out the other faction?
---
You see them struggle, you charge in and give them the finishing blow!
---
it stopped for about 18 hours, tldr still ddos
---
I mean I definitely see more racist shit on classic than retail but sure man whatever you say
---
Connect that to 20 servers, and 1million+ users hammering the network every second and you will have latency issues. In normal networks moving slower isn't an enormous deal but in an MMO latency is everything. I get what your saying but in an MMO it's much more difficult.
---
Wait a week
---
No he is saying your salary implicitly includes the "extra" overtime pay because overtime is a natural part of the work. Sorry but I'm definitely not strumming a violin for the poor souls who get to work salary at Actiblizzion lol.

Looking it up now, are there any protips you can think of?  even down to things like- if i wanted to start 2 toons, and level them in areas where most of the quests are kill quests not loot quests? (starting out atleast so up to lvl 20)?
---
Most engie items aren't good for AH, cause only other engineers can use them.

Slouching's great dude, I have pectus excavatum which is essentially a big ass pit in my chest, could fit a family size bag of Doritos, or anything else in there. The possibilities are endless.
---
Key words there are *on sight*. If you see us and can catch us then we deserve to die. Assuming, of course that you *can* kill us.
---
The higher percentage rep discounts were later expansions.
---
When you see a lot of mixed opinions generally it means it doesn‚Äôt matter that much. Arms or fury is fine. Prot is too if you dont care at all about speed.
---
What level and server is this?
---
to be fair the only one that seemed to be working earlier today was Faerlina, at least from the streamers perspective. They could all log in while Thalnos and Herod and plenty of others were fucked
---
just got booted from Herod and can't get back in
---
4:53pm PST 9/8

Only insane people don't enable class colours in chat!

Huh, I stopped fishing at 220 because I assumed the next area would be a pain to travel at level 30. Regarding mob levels and what not.

---
What server, friend?
---
yes i do for a laptop, duno if 2600k has graphics but 4k series laptop does fine
---
Find a guild, make some friends, level slower,work on crafting, make an alt. Some things you can do.
---
Blizzard has already said that a "low" population server now is higher populated than a full server in 2004. They've also said they'd merge servers if they need to.
---
There's literally no reason to play on Herod... the middle of the pack servers like Kromcrush, Surfuras, Bigglesworth, etc. have literally no threat of dying and don't run into the issues that the streamer servers do.
---
I've been leveling as Arms, currently lvl48.  Hamstring kiting is huge, and things speed up a lot once you get both Sweeping Strikes and MS.

I have no idea what the 'perfection' image is supposed to be.

Seems like it.

I get it. I'm not too upset I can't play but I am pissed at *why* I can't play.

Sulfuras down AGAIN
---
UGHHH
---
Aaaand again
---
this shit is getting outa hand man, for real
---
How much is a bot net? Cheap enough that anyone could get one or is this something only select people could afford? Is this stuff going to become more common?
---
Probably Paladin. They‚Äôre a little boring to level but if you‚Äôre teaming up with someone the capability to tank and also heal will be wonderful.
---
And, of course, you are in Loch Modan. The Loch is the best place in the game. My Wow home.
---
Always maxed fishing and cooking but this time around it feels lackluster. Tender wolf steaks are dirt cheap from the brd aoe grind and nightfin soup isn‚Äôt selling at all. Might just fish Stonescale for armor pots :/. I do enjoy the 45 pound red gill offhand I fished up lol.
---
&gt;I don't get how it could not be prevented, or at least solved yesterday.
---
lol.
---
Bigglsworth down again?
