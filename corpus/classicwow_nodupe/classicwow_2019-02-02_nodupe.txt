That is how those dungeons were all launched. They were dropped to 5 mans later. I am 100% sure about that for UBRS/LBRS and, like 90% sure of that for the other two.
---
---
---
But wow isn't made in scale anyway, it was always designed like a themepark. I agree they could pass on the road, but all the other additions i liked. At least they didn't wreck the entire zone like they did with Azshara or Barrens.
---
I bought an $800 Dell PC for Classic, but at least now I have a decent computer for other games i like to play as well. 
---

---
My old laptop couldn't even handle retail on low settings.
---
Holy fuck. That was amazing.
---
Hell no bro
---
Yeah I am not super artistic. Someone who is should make it better. I used GIMP to label and put dungeon icons.
---
https://nofile.io/f/KoPyGOWzUzt/Leveling.xcf
---
I personally like the absence of people there. It'll be my go-to place to herb and fish
---
Why not? Theres achievment in not using add ons.  
---
Blacksmithing kind of sucks but Engineering is by far the most useful profession for PvE and PvP in vanilla, and you'll need mining for that.
---
There was no achievements in vanilla. 
---
That's a pretty good one. It is made with the minimap images instead of the map.
---
Yeah. I mean I guess it's tough because you'd want to use color to label the zone level visually. I dunno maybe just black background was all it took.
---
But hey, it's super handy to have, thanks!
---
Naxx was one of the best things about WoW across all xpacs, the opening event and the challenge was amazing, never finished it in vanilla and the wotlk was a pale imitation. Can’t wait to complete it, 
---
Fun fact: UBRS started in Vanilla as 15-man dungeon. It was later changed to 10-man
---
This really chimed with me, couldn’t explain it better 
---
Especially when meta is known so how else do you create new challenge without new content? 
---
But why?
---
This is so cringe 
---
I would not bother. When they introduced sharding. They removed the idea it was an mmorpg. If you are of the opinion that flying mounts made the world less "alive" brother you aint seen nothing yet lol.
---
If you're horde, a shaman can kill a mage that is 10 levels above with no effort.  
---
Warlock is good IF they have the proper pet, but shaman just steamrolls.  
---
  
---
I'd say it's worth it to check out, I'd say you'd probably enjoy it if you haven't played since wrath.  It's no classic, but I think if you played through a bit (leveling normally, not with dungeon finder-spamming) you'll find yourself having fun.  Also it's interesting checking out the things the cataclysm did to the world.  
---
What is with this preoccupation with new content?
---
Another huge swath of people won't even complete their prebis set. There is so much to do in Vanilla.
---
If you don't feel motivated to play anymore, *then don't.*
---
There is no good reason for Activision Blizzard to go around adding new content, new patches, new items and dungeons and etc to Vanilla WoW. Absolutely no good reason.
---
Pff, peasant. 
---
Autoloot works with a key modifier, as per the demo.
---
I've only ever seen UBRS/LBRS run as 10 mans, and Strat/Scholo run as 5 mans.
---
Can anyone clarify if it will be any different in Classic?
---
Yeah but why the rollback, couldn't a GM just /kill or /despawn him?
---
I think if they ever introduce new content they should make the difficulty of the content directly proportional to the loot it provides. I don't want to see pity epics. If you want gear that is as good as Naxx gear you need to do something as difficult as Naxx raiding.
---
Also, I think it would be nice if the difficulty scaled slightly faster than the loot. Farming ilvl 80 gear while wearing ilvl 80 gear should be easier than farming ilvl 90 gear while wearing ilvl 90 gear. This should help keep power creep down.
---
I’m going to use some words and phrases and I want to know which you think means “new content”
---
Classic
---
Recreating history
---
Museum piece
---
Awesome sorry to lash out, I know I sound unreasonable but I just don't see the point in holding shift every mob I press when questing alone and looting everything anyways. I guess I've gotten so used to it joining in TBC that I got bothered whenever I missed the shift key and I am just standing there like an idiot.
---
At least a month of pure enjoyment and I'd be happy.
---
These recent korean mmos haven't kept me entertained for more than a few weeks.
---
Some of them were very very easy. Ysondre comes to mind. They were a must farm really when progressing through AQ40.
---
IonGASM
---
Well... unless Classic WoW turns out to be far more profitable than Blizzard anticipated and they decide that they don't want the demotivated players to stop playing.
---
I've been torn between Shaman and Pally for a while now. My only (vanilla) experience with them is leveling and dungeons on pservers. I will be raiding come classic and wondered if anyone had any anecdotes as to their dynamic/playstyle as a healer in a raid environment. Also, if anyone has raided as both, how would you compare the two? What do you love about one but or can't you stand on the other?
---
So, elites have a higher drop rate on rarer items?
---
A couple opinions (just random thoughts more likely):
---
I feel like Ashenvale for the Horde is a leveling trap.  It's very wide spread.  The flightpoints are awkwardly positioned (although one is close to the only zone dungeon).  I'd only suggest leveling in Ashenvale if you are a druid, shaman, or hunter (all 3 have some form of early improved speed) and even then it's a wash.  I never recall getting any decent gear from there.  BFD has "ok" (not great) gear for all classes, and it's a dungeon that feels unrewarding and drawn out.
---
Wailing Caverns, Shadowfang Keep, and Deadmines are all excellent early dungeons to do as they all give a good mix of gear for nearly any class.  (On a side note: stockades is rarely worth running.  Very few bosses, and I believe the only moderately good items are from completing some quests in there)
---
After leveling numerous alts in the Vanilla/BC days I feel like STV is also a trap leveling zone for both sides.  It's got good quests, and is only a good idea if you chose skinning as your profession (lots of animals/skinnable corpses).  The Green Hills of STV book/side quest never seemed worth it to me, and the chain quest with Nessingwary was always annoying to me.  Not to mention but if you play on a PvP server STV was notorious for ganking!
---
My leveling path I generally took as Alliance was: Race Starting Zone&gt;Westfall&gt;Duskwood/RedRidge&gt;Arathi/Alterac/Hillsbrad&gt;Tanaris&gt;WPL/Ungoro&gt;EPL.
---
As Horde my leveling path was: Race Starting Zone&gt;Barrens/Silverpine&gt;Hillsbrad/Alterac/Arathi&gt;Swamp of Sorrows/Tanaris&gt;WPL&gt;EPL
---
Not to much deviation later I suppose.
---
BFAs login screen looks great to me. It’s the parts after that that aren’t fun.
---
I really enjoyed it as a 15 man. I got my wildheart best at the end of a long 15 man UBRS. I slapped my hands together so hard in excitement that they stung for like 10 minutes. That was long before people were raiding MC and Onyxia regularly so it was a colossal upgrade over my iron feather breastplate.
---
It’s basically a guarantee that they will run in their 5/10 orientation, rather than 10/15. No reason to assume Blizz would revert back to something not contained in 1.12
---
I think it's going to remind a lot of people how an MMO is done right.  Good balance between sense of community, sense of accomplishment, good pvp, good pve.  Not saying it'll live up to my memories, but I remember clearly certain aspects I haven't felt since WotLK imo.  I've tried most expansions since WotLK, but all I just logged off and never returned without much thought
---
I’m probably a quarter life or third life crisis, but fuck I’m excited 
---
It will be 1.12 so no it will not be different. However earlier in Vanilla (1.0-1.3) there weren’t caps and most people would run strat and scholo as 10 mans. Much later (~1.10 iirc) they trimmed down mob packs in scholo and strat so they were easier for just 5. Even though they had been capped by then.
---
I wouldn't worry.
---
As I have said before, just because Unilever makes both Axe and Dove does not mean that Dove will inevitably turn into Axe. These big companies make multiple products *specifically because* they capture two different markets. The entire commercial purpose of Classic is to extract money from people who like Classic enough to pay for it but do not like retail/modern enough to pay for it.
---
It's funny, I only played retail Vanilla during the time there was no shift+click autoloot, and when I started playing on pservers I thought damn, this is so nice and convenient, 100% happy with it. And here you are asking for the same thing but one iteration more automated.
---
They are really fine line arguments. I sincerely think that you have to consider the average noob-idiot-sheep-child that will turn on autoloot and not know what they are looting at all, ruining things. Maybe it's best to keep it shift+click for that reason.
---
I'd argue that they should keep shift+click, but even though it was in the demo it's still up in the air. We can't be absolutely certain they won't change it.
---
IMO most of these things should be kept just like they were in Vanilla, and just be customised to each player's taste with addons just like it was during Vanilla.
---
There are Vanilla addons that let you autoloot without shift key, or auto loot only white items or items above a certain silver value, etc. I'm sure addons like these will be developed for Classic very quickly.
---
Play retail for new content. 
---
Mine was like $2000 and I still have shit fucking up on me. The fan on the top doesn’t even work anymore 
---
I believe some items can only drop off elites. 
---
Then go back to retail.
---
Building on this, it makes you feel more like a normal denizen of Azeroth and are going on an adventure rather than knowing everything that has happened.
---
"Like what I like or don't play my mmo" What a guy.
---
The fucking post is about raiding you mong
---
Lol he's wearing a dress, what a bitch
---
Come join the Horde  we have shamans and wolves 
---
LBRS can be ran with 10, but is more often ran with 5.
---
Duh but this conversation is debating the sentence "nothing hard about vanilla leveling" obviously. Either you're extremely dense or you're a low test troll who doesnt know what good trolling is. 
---
for the vast majority of vanilla strat/scholo were run 10 man unless you were trying to do a quest run.  they patched 40 man dungeons early on and made them max 5/10 in a late patch 
---
can you complete quests as raid in those dungeons?
---
Dude I never had any problems soloing as warrior in vanilla on a PvP server. I almost exclusively played Protection spec, and leveled that way. Mostly alone. I'd pull groups just like an AoE mage, but take much longer to kill them. If I got jumped, I got jumped. Part of it.
---
But there were many, many times someone tried to make an HK cookie out of me and got roflstomped. Some of the most epic memories of vanilla I have were a few of those fights. I once fought a Paladin alone in Eastern Plaguelands for almost 20 minutes. 
---
I was able to use Last Stand and Shield Wall multiple times during the fight, and the paladin just stayed OOM. It was an incredible experience I'll never forget. It's less about the class and more about your skill level as a player.
---
Basically over the expansions wow has transformed from a massive coop experience into a fantastic single player game with multiplayer functions.
---
There are tons of cutscenes and cinematics, sharding makes you on your own adventure most of the time. So from a story aspect it’s a really really cool game compared to vanilla.
---
But it’s almost strictly a single player game now, no interactions with other people, even in dungeons no one talks or coordinates...you might as well play with npcs.
---
So I’d say play through just to see the cinematics and lore, it’s pretty cool. But it’s not how it used to be, and definitely doesn’t feel the same. You’ll get bored once the story unfolds and then just wait for classic :)
---
You're not the sharpest tool in the shed are you? I said i edited my post because the original wording could me misconstrued or since you probably don't understand that word "misinterpreted." As in the original wording could be confused as meaning something other than their intention. Although the fact you call what could be at most 2 paragraphs as a "wall of text" makes me think you still use the scholastic reading level to determine what rooks you read. 
---
Add to that the fact that you just stated you have nothing to add and literally started commenting on this thread to bitch and say "no changes" you've wasted my time and everyone who has bother to read this thread. Have a good night.
---
Only quests labeled as "(raid)" can. From what I understand, most LBRS quests are 5 man only but UBRS quests obviously are designated as raid quests.
---
You have a choice, you have retail. Classic is for us. Stop trying to change it, it's not up for change.
---
Well If I win the lottery and find myself with enough time to get to 60 in no time I think farming is the way to go. Would probably do world pvp and help out players by just running around the world and seeing what everyone is doing
---
one thing transmog fd up, walking around and seeing a weapon from a tough raid and then you respec that person for some reason lol
---
Or and, hear me out now. We don't shard the game for the first few weeks and, we don't mess with anything else. Instead we just drop the game and, people muddle through just like they did back in the day. MMO's existed before sharding. MMO's were more popular before sharding. Shards and, their supporters have no place in the classic wow community. If you love all the new crap play retail. 
---
Nice did you farm for them or just a random drop?
---
Druid for those of you who want 95% effectiveness for 300% of the effort. lol for real though. Druids are one of the coolest classes in classic wow. It's the only class they ever made that works on hit and, run tactics. It's like a bad ass guerilla fighter.
---
Yeah, priest or paladin would have more synergy, but druid has the option to tank while leveling/dungeoning and wont fight over cloth.
---
Could we perhaps start a thread and discuss PC builds solely for WoW?
---
How different are the requirements be for Classic now compared to 2004?
---
Having a partner will do nothing but slow down a druid or hunter because of their movement forms. That being said yea as a duo they pair well. 
---
Got [this sucker](https://www.amazon.com/iBUYPOWER-Trace-9220-Overclockable-Motherboard/dp/B07G77QHV8) on sale. Would’ve splurged a bit more but got one for my wife too so we can play together.
---
Yeah if I could play the AH that'd be wonderful. Tried many times and failed. Me no good with moneys
---
Is there any way into Hyjal? 
---
When I started in vanilla, UBRS was 10man, all the others 5man.
---
BC was great but introduced a lot of features that ruined the world:
---
separating the playerbase into continents made azeroth a barren wasteland
---
adding flying mounts nearly completely killed world-pvp in one stroke
---
daily quests created a false urgency for people to login and play, but not because they enjoyed it, because they felt obligated to
---
the "badge" system that cheapened epics and reduced the feeling of wonder when you obtained them or saw others who did
---
the removal of 40-man raids meant the loss of the most epic-scale encounters the game has ever seen
---
arena, while more balanced and "esports ready" than any other pvp content thus far, highlighted blizzard's terrible attempt at pvp balance. this created a huge problem for the class balancing team, and lots of classes were nerfed or altered just because of their ability in arena (despite it being a small or non-existent content for many players)
---
Well this is gonna be her first time playing, so we’re in no rush to get to 60. I’m going to try and live vicariously through her and experience the game for the first time all over again lol.
---
my first high level dungeon in retail vanilla was a 10 man scholo. ubrs and lbrs where 15 man but in oder to complete the lbrs quests you needed to do them as 5 man grps because the quests for it arent raid quests but dungeon quests.
---
Honestly I would think it is the MOST important for a tank, the more threat you put out the better off your entire raid is, if one persons dps is 5% lower than the other its really not as big of a deal as the 30 other players being able to put out 5% more dps because of the extra threat afforded.
---
Agreed, all the reasons you listed are why I quit early in TBC, along with server transfers which destroyed my awesome server community. 
---
Your best bet would be to join a guild willing to give it to you since the mats are stupid expensive.  
---
If you decide to farm the mats yourself I'd imagine you'll have to run your own MC pugs and reserve blood of the mountain, sulfuron ingots and the dark iron ores. 
---
Boars!
---
stv is by far the best questing zone, but theres also more pvp activity than elsewhere pre 50
---
Herb/Engi probably.
---
Herb/Enchanting if you want the tank trinket
---
It was slow- had to spend dkp on the raid mats and farmed the rest.
---
just like it was in early vanilla
---
This was always my favorite.  Loved getting to 40, and sending it to tanaris!
---
It changed in July 2005 so 6 months, hardly the vast majority of vanilla lol
---
The difficult part is just getting the Eye of Sulfuras, really. The materials will come flying at you the moment you have the eye. People are all too eager to help people out on getting a Legendary.
---
Absolutely. The current infrastructure isn't really set up to handle MMORPGs by the looks of it.
---
yes
---
UBRS was never 5 man. Started 15 man and dropped to 10
---
I'm fine with it naturally being shift click still, however people will just come accustomed to shift click anyways. One way or another I will find a way to just right click ie addons.   
---
I just think we need to focus our energy on slaying the dragon of loot trading first before we worry about the small stuff.
---
You also don't get gem drops to form the UBRS key when running LBRS as a raid
---
how
---
Why would you ever want to have Magram anything other than hated? You some kinda Maggy lover? You go Gelkis or you go home bro.
---
Lady taurens have none of these problems!
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbwVvK5XLb4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbwVvK5XLb4)
---
Definitely not "vast majority". A few months into the game, they were nerfed from being scaled for 10 man to 5. I also think quests worked with a 10 man group before the nerf a but not 100% on that, I was not 60 yet but I remember the talk of the nerf in trade chat and patch notes
---
Not all of them were terrible. Zangarmarsh was beyond fantastic. But then again, that was the only one indeed.
---
Good to know!
---
What a trash post.
---
He’s thinking to himself “I’m going to get them so hyped for Classic, then drop a loot system from cata on their ass. *evil laugh*”
---
Overlevel the zone you're in. It also helps you by having weapon/defense skill advantage more than it does for other classes.
---
Also, as a warrior you often don't have to be alone. Find a healer buddy and you will both boost your leveling. Since you can take on more mobs with a healer you get more rage. And take advantage of cleave/ww/sweeping strikes, and the healer gets kills faster than they normally would. Healers also love befriending warriors to save for later to run dungeons with.
---
Helped a buddy farm the mats and reps to craft his. Lots of time making bar runs in BRD, racing around winterspring hunting rich thorium ores for him, spamming trade for transmutes.
---
It was fun, it took a while, but we made sure he had everything ready to craft it when the eye dropped. That was all he spent dkp on in MC. The guild MT wanted to keep it for himself, not even having leveled blacksmithing yet, but enough of us threw a fit in vent and my buddy got it in the end. We quit that guild shortly after because that kind of favoritism and drama was too common. 
---
If you do mythics there is a lot of coordination and talking to be fair. All the end game content require a lot of coordination.
---
Farm tons of flowers and eye of shadow.
---
Meth
---
This.
---
Get ready to spam that Chain Heal button in PVE.
---
Is shield wall not an hour CD in vanilla?
---
And sorry mate but if you were roflstomping people as warrior then they must be just terrible.
---
Which isn’t unlikely in Classic, we’re gonna see a lot of newbs roll, but my point is don’t expect it.
---
Truthfully, anyone who knows their class can 1v1 even a geared and smart warrior. Until they hit 40ish warrs are just sitting ducks
---
I'm not too sure about that last bit. From what I've always understood there are no jumps, only soft caps where miss chance is calculated based on your weapon skill differently. From 300-305 your weapon skill is incredible value per point vs. lv. 63 mobs. After 305 it soft caps when it switches to the second formula and becomes much, much less valuable.
---
This is from Wowwiki but I think the calculations are still correct.
---
-for 300-305, this is used 
---
If the difference between the mob's Defense Skill and your Weapon Skill is greater than 10, then the formula for calculating your base miss chance against that mob is: 6% + (Defense Skill - Weapon Skill - 10)*.4%
---
-for 305-315 this is used
---
If the difference between the mob's Defense Skill and your Weapon Skill is less than or equal to 10 then the formula for calculating your base miss chance against that mob is: 5% + (Defense Skill - Weapon Skill)*.1%
---
So using these formulae, these are your base miss chances per point.
---
300 - 8%
---
301 - 7.6%
---
302 - 7.2%
---
303 - 6.8%
---
304 - 6.4%
---
at this point the formula changes over to the second
---
305 - 6%
---
310 - 5.5%
---
315 - 5%
---
This goes likewise for your chance to be parried. Big thing for tanks, not as much of a deal for DPS. Now, onto Glancing blows.
---
From what I remember it doesn't reduce the frequency of glancing blows but reduce the damage reduction you get. At 300 weapon skill vs a 63 mob 40% of your hits are glancing blows that deal 35% less damage. By 305 that's reduced to 15% less damage. There's another set of calculations for that depending on whether it's &gt; or &lt; 305 but it's complicated and I can't remember it.
---
So summing up, Weapon skill from 300-305 is by far the best stat in the game for all melee classes. That means that the racial bonus is much more of a deal if nobody has any weapon skill gear. But If you're a non-human/orc with 305 weapon skill, you're not nearly as far behind a human/orc with 310 because your +5 is far more valuable than theirs.
---
"Classic is for us" no it's not, it's for anyone willing to play it. Who is us exactly? I started back in april 2005 what exactly gives you more of a say over me? 
---
That piece is good. Very good. But it's not BiS forever. [T3 is better](https://classicdb.ch/?item=22428).
---
Not trying to argue your claim that it's a fucking amazing piece, though.
---
And if wanted retail i'd play retail classic is and was a completely different game with a different feeling and atmosphere.
---
 Besides, we can't even wholly agree as a community what "gameplay and design of vanilla" *means*, so how could we ever be in a position to say with confidence that new content conforms to it? 
---
That's a solid argument and one I dont have a counter to. Only thing to do now is wait and see.
---
I’m enjoying BfA, but I certainly have gripes about it.  The biggest gripe to me is scaled leveling.  Every enemy you fight is your level and they level with you.
---
When you’re level 10, it will be just as “difficult” to kill a Zhevra as it would be at level 60.
---
Once you blast past all the main world stuff (ironic), then you hit your stride.
---
It’s a weird world when you play from 1-110.  110-120 is more densely populated since that’s where the bulk of people are.
---
Bottom line, I agree with the comment(s) saying it’s a great single player game with multiplayer functions.  It’s neat and all, but it’s certainly more like Diablo 3 than WotLK and before.
---
Not me.... because I AM ADULT NOW I HAVE REAL LIFE AN OBLIGATIONS FFFFF *cry* 
---
tbh i liked nagrand more than almost any zone in azeroth
---
im quite fond of netherstorm as well
---
10 minutes to 5 minutes won't ruin it but it won't solve it either. 
---
I love Tirisfal, Silverpine, Duskwood, and EPL for atmosphere. The zones are dark like my soul /s
---
2H Ele/Enha spec is just useless,trust me,I tried to make it work several times but always ended up disappointed. 3%hit,5%crit and NS are just too good to skip :)
---
IIRC Shield Wall was 15 or 30 minutes. I was unstoppable and with potions could outlast any healer after level 40. I had that class macro'd like hell with AHK.
---
Well bc &amp; wrath it's technically different, new zones, stormwind harbor, yada yada
---
Back in my day 1000€ was nothing for a gaming PC. Nowadays that's well future proof, on a gaming laptop even, let alone desktop.
---
Not even close in my opinion. Wpvp and atmosphere was so much more immersive and fun in classic. I feel like most people who enjoyed BC more came in on the tail end of vanilla, or simply never played it at all
---
Nothing about having a classic + says that they have to get rid of what they are already planning. They could easily have separate servers and keep everybody happy.
---
However expressing what we as a customer would like isn't an option though, if people had listened to the kind of rhetoric your suggesting wouldn't be getting classic at all. Previously we had the option of either playing retail, or playing a different game, but by voicing our opinions we are getting classic.
---
scare beast shouldnt work on druids because you can just shift out before it goes off.
---
Devil's advocate, #nochanges can be consistent with #nochangesfrom1.12 as it regards to talents &amp; launch content, and many seem to believe that we can &amp; should protest loot sharing &amp; sharding to make Blizz revert that decision. 
---
I'm far from #nochanges, just saying a lot of this sub seems to believe the door is still shuttable at this point
---
But we don't need those things anymore
---
epic! I actually met that guy too in the game
---
I *love* leveling in BFA (and Legion before that). If you take your time and read the lore/quests, it's seriously a blast. Take in the scenery, etc. Character progression is nearly non-existent, but the landscapes, visuals, music, and story is really worth experiencing. It'll take multiple toons for you to see it all.
---
I'm a bit lost. Do ninjas not know how to hold shift?
---
Old hyjal was cool. I loved the Hyjal raid. Finally entering that strange blank spot on the map was satisfying, even if it was in the past. The cata hyjal was disappointing. I wanted to enter from winter spring.
---
YouTube Blizzcon 2016 and skip to 57:35
---
A rogue with preparation at 40 would absolutely shit on a warrior. Even a rogue without prep still has you beat. Mithril shield spike does nothing against a rogue keeping you CCd and building combo points with 5point eviscerate. Only an idiot rogue is trading white hits with a plate warrior. And your best CD, retaliate, does nothing against a rogue who can just vanish it or blind you and wait out the duration. Sorry mate but you were going up against newbs. 
---
How was the entrance to hyjal introduced in cata? Did they like dig a hole through the mountains?
---
I've had this convo 1000 times man, I'm not theorycrafting with you. I'll see you at the top of the BG Score screen, as protection.
---
Exact same.  I am prepping them slowly... 
---
I don't even know what a boost is lol
---
How would you feel if blizzard never had those on the map and just cut them out for sea instead? Like if there were none of those zones on the map to begin with. What if the game didn't have any of the unreleased stuff during vanilla and it was never in production, just cut all the things you listed...content for the sake of content where does it stop. Why would you end it off at a certain point other than Naxxramas? What's the difference?
---
Yeah, my brother and 2 other friends had fun with BFA for about 2 months just doing mythic dungeons and a few raids.  Definitely challenging, especially the dungeons.  But the expansion felt very empty on content outside this, so we took a break.  Now we're all just waiting on classic.  
---
What I liked in TBC:
---
1. Arena
---
2. Heroic dungeons
---
3. Classes having more than one viable spec option.
---
4. Karazhan was a really fun raid.
---
Otherwise vanilla is superior in every regard for me. The game design in Vanilla was just too consistent compared to anything after it. It had more horizontal progression compared to the expansions (except for Naxx which had insanely OP gear), and Azeroth is just way more interesting than Outland.
---
The hinterlands confuse me. They send me there are 30 with a quest and everything is impossibly high. 
---
By the time i get there are 45, everything is STILL impossibly high. 
---
Do they really want me to run from tarren mill everytime I want to quest as horde on the west side of hinterlands?
---
Your choice of wording makes me laugh. "Being allowed"? Play how you want to play and don't let other people dictate anything. If you're a solid player you'll master your new class and find a place. Maybe it's with another guild.
---
They've stated a lot of things.
---
Yeah but you'll still have to buy the current expansion.
---
Yeah, they' re really competitive healers tho
---
MadSeasonShow would be proud. 
---
You have a choice of whether or not to reply to me.  If you think my posts are a waste of time, then don't bother replying to them.  The fact you spent the time it takes to write each of these replies tells me that either you don't actually believe it's a waste of time, or that your time is worth wasting.  I'm not making you read these or reply to these.  That's your own choice.
---
I have nothing to add to the game.  I have plenty to say about people who think there should be things added to the game.  
---
I just read your edit.  It didn't "clarify" anything.  It changed what you said.  Changes are not clarifications.
---
Not necessarily. Buying a subscription gives you everything up to and including Legion content, so while you won't be able to get the authentic raiding experience, you can level to 110 and do dungeons and such.
---
Well said. I resound this sentiment. 
---
You get a 30% xp bump at 3 people, so a third person barely has to do anything to be worth it. Either two people split 50% ea or 3 people get 43% ea. Put another way, if they together kill 20 mobs in 10 minutes, you only have to help kill 3 more for it to be better to group with you.
---
Basically, you can pay $60 to start at lvl 110, which is the most recent leveling content. You might get a boost for free if you buy the latest expansion. It's their way of dealing with player level disparity.
---
Currently live in a small apartment so it saves space and it also gives me the ability to bring it with me if I ever go in the road for work. 
---
Ill start working on bis pre raid while skilling up professions to 300. 
---
The modern client is a lot more demanding than the original 2004 client. It's still pretty lightweight but it does demand things of your rig. I bought a mid range laptop in Cataclysm and it ran WoW just fine if I turned down the graphics a bit, it handled MOP and WOD well but in Legion it couldn't handle it anymore. Same graphic settings but the FPS went from 50-60 to below 20, and that's the client they're using for Classic, they might even be using the BfA client but we don't know that yet.
---
This was at blizzcon, they talked about the slower vanilla rogue regeneration ticks, specifically saying they would not alter them.
---
&gt; arena
---
I hated this most of all.  Creating "balance" in the name of arena resulted in constant PVE nerfs that just shit all over the classes.  You hit the nail on the head with the e-sports description.  WoW was an rpg first; arenas made the rpg aspect secondary in favor of single player combat.
---
I really love the idea of playing enhance shaman, but I also want to raid for the most part. Is there an alternative that's similar in playstyle to enhance that's more useful as dps in raids?
---
As many others have said, excellent video ty. 
---
Think it may have just put me over the top to play shammy vs mage (my 2 original chars and only 60s). Guess its time to break out every good luck charm/religious icon i can find and get to praying to RNGesus and go enhancement purely for my own selfish fun and big numbers.
---
Played both And honestly i find them both awesome in different ways.
---
Making azeroth a barren wasteland wasn't a factor of BC; it was a lack of imagination on the part of the developers. They could have added dynamic gameplay to the old world. They chose not to.
---
Flying mounts made repeat gameplay and farming tolerable.
---
Daily quests made content repeatable, which was a good thing not a bad thing.
---
Badge systems are exactly what the current gear system needs.
---
40-man raids were too many moving parts to have complex, interesting fights. Either we reduce that number or we lose all the difficult raid bosses we've encountered since then.
---
TL;DR You claim to love this game and want to make it better, but all you've done is make it worse. Are you Ion by any chance?
---
I just want to play a Rogue again instead of this pruned nu-Rogue trash on retail
---
Improved Wing Clip. In BGs Entrapment is incredibly good when the Frost Trap is dropped on choke points, enemy GYs, flags, etc, because it lasts a long time and every tick of the slow effect has a chance to immobilize. However in world PvP you'll almost always want to use Freezing Trap instead.
---
I feel like we could trade bop loot in wowlk brosef.
---
Hah! The "you can heal!" is spot-on and hilarious. 
---
I was a druid in vanilla, at least the lore is pretty cool.
---
TBC doesn't even feel like Warcraft to me.  Instead of demons and undead with candles and evil magic, it was space ships, aliens, and steam punk tech.
---
I miss human leveling it always felt so fast being able to run around in the same area.
---
Arena wouldn't be much fun in vanilla because classes are not balanced around it. Rogue/mage would dominate even more than paladin/DK in S5, it would be completely unbalanced to the point of being not fun at all. Better addition would be rated BG
---
You think you do but you don't
---
While leveling my Orc warrior in tanaris , right in the smack middle down south a little , on the biggest sand dunes, grinding away , don't see to many people out that way . Here comes a pally ,  grinding away too. I run over to him , while he's on a mob , around 40-50% hp , I wait patiently next to him. He kills his mob and drinks / eats up all meanwhile I'm standing watching . Waiting. He gets too 100% , stands up , I bow to him , he bows back . Charge is on , we have a combat exchanging blows , bubbling , popping health pots, two infact ! It was a good fight , we get each other down too 10% hp. He's oom, my health pots CD to long away . We stop . Salute each other, bow and enjoy some food . We parted ways on that dune . It was epic , and satisfying without even getting an HK . We both knew we were so far away from the graveyard and how shitty it would have been to run back ! Such majesty in combat , we had to respect each other ! Was the best fight I've ever had on any wow game hands down. Love it ! Though not everyone is like this, but vanilla players are a different class :)  
---
There will likely be a very short lag time between release and people rewriting the macros to correctly work, if they do not work out of the gate.  Most of the macro mechanics for druid are relatively simple to fix yourself.  Addons will be the same story some will work some won't out of the box, and the community will fix them.  
---
I hardly think badges cheapened epics. You had to do Heroic 5 mans or Kara at least, to get them. It took a lot more personal skill to get a sack of badges than to get an epic in Molten Core, imo. 
---
I think the bigger reason epics feel more valuable in Vanilla, is that not even all *epics* are that great. There are plenty of blues that are more valuable than some of what you find in MC, etc... 
---
Also, you couldn’t fly until level... 70, right? Or was it 67? Either way, for the majority of the time spent leveling, you were still on the ground. That’s a fair trade imo, even if I’d rather it gone.
---
Also, arena was a lot of fun, it just wasn’t executed perfectly. It was absolutely the catalyst for homogenization, which is why WotLK was truly the first real step into homogenized design. 
---
Plus, I love 25m raids. I enjoy 40 too, but vent is quieter in a 40 since everyone has to shut up, the larger challenge of a raid is forming it, and you do feel a tiny bit faceless in a 40 man.
---
Overall, I’ll be ecstatic if I have both games to play as they were, more or less. If I want to play on-foot in 1 world, without badges and with 40 mans, I’ll gladly hop over to Classic.
---
I just don’t get why there’s that % of people who just *do not* want Blizzard to think about recreating BC. We can have our cake and eat it too, whether or not it’s Vanilla... We still have our Vanilla cake this time.
---
Yea. You’ll be able to level easier as BM, and your pet will destroy people in low level PVP. Beastial Wrath with Intimidate will wreck.
---
Played both religiously. I prefer BC, and I still play Vanilla privately. Vanilla certainly captures a different essence, which is great in its own right. For some though, BC softened some edges and made a much more entertaining game for them. I loved the diversity you’d see in 25 man raids, almost every spec was both viable and unique, a first-and-never-again in WoW. 
---
I hope if Classic is very successful they will do a Burning Crusade server, I loved TBC a lot. I thought it brought a great balance to the game and I think during TBC professions were at their best, jewel-crafting was really cool. I don’t think the game started really going downhill until ToC in wrath 
---
I'd highly recommend beast spec while leveling.  It's an amazing PvP spec against other levelers with poor gear.  It loses it's effectiveness at 60 because it doesn't scale with gear, but it's ridiculously OPed before then.  Also, Marks is pretty gimped without a good bow.  Once you get the AV crossbow at 51 it becomes quite viable, but before that it's quite weak.
---
Herb is only a +15 skill bonus which makes you able to pick Earthroots right away. It’s nothing. 
---
tbc knocked class design out of the park.  any shortcoming is outweighed by this for me and i dont agree with most of the popular criticism anyway
---
Vanilla has been fully figured out for years. It’s entirely on you if that fact ruins your Classic experience. 
---
I say all of us watch this ep the day or hour before Classic comes out
---
TBC all day. That's when I started playing and that's the only classic server that could bring me back. It would never be the same though 
---
happened on more than one server.  
---
I’m defiantly going to play classic but I just loved TBC. It was my junior and senior year of HS and I went all in on it. I played Vanilla but only got to around 40 before burning crusade came out. I hope I have enough time to devote to the game to raid. 
---
Always scorn online porn!
---
Not really, but an enha shammy with nightfall is a pretty common occurrence in raids.
---
Omg. I am sorry... but STFU. Your age is showing. 
---

[removed]
---
I love the color-coded dungeon ranges. Well done!
---
patch 1.3 (march 2005):
---
With that in mind, the dungeons below now have the following caps:
---
Onyxia/Molten Core - 40 members
---
Blackrock Spire - 15 members
---
Diremaul - 5 members
---
All other dungeons in the game will be capped at 10 members.
---
patch 1.10 (march 2006)
---
Stratholme, Scholomance, and Blackrock Depths now allow a maximum of five players inside, and Blackrock Spire allows a maximum of ten.
---
so a full year (in the middle of the game) they were 10 man.  ~5 months as 40 man.  ~9 months as 5 man when they were the least relevant 
---
You put Wailing Caverns in the wrong place
---
Still missing Razorfen Kraul and Ashenvale Nightmare Dragon.
---
I fucking hate this aspect about myself but my only real life goals right now is killing Kel'Thuzzad and protecting the Horde. I'm not even joking. I'm not proud of it in fact it's extremely embarrassing. Like I have a job and friends but I care about WoW way more than real life.
---
I rewatched this episode recently and was honestly surprised by how accurate it was to the game. Pretty much everything cartman says when he is directing the other kids is stuff you would actually do. I do remember kinda annoying things like Stan's Father claiming to have "beaten Fargodeep mine" despite he clearly just made his character.
---
Makes me wonder how much Matt &amp; Trey played WoW.
---
https://youtu.be/jXYwYMIEG30
---
This video has a link to a 0.8 beta client and shows how to get it working. Not quite as exciting as the alpha one but still cool to look around. 
---
Can we stop with the farce of saying flying mounts killed world PvP. 
---
All it did was stop people from camping lesser geared people ...and...those who wanted to wpvp...did. 
---
ARENA killed wpvp. It started the game of balancing things around a small setting and stopped the need to rely on others. 
---
I loved the progression from Tirisfal thru SilverPine, Hillsbrad and Arathi. Each zone has such a different feel to it.
---
I remember the first time running thru Arathi to get the Hammerfall flightpath and being like 5-10 levels too low. Even staying on the road was dangerous.
---
Those clasps on his cloak got turned into usable shields in World of Warcraft.
---
MA...  MA.....
---
BUCKET
---
Vanilla was great and I wish they would have expanded the game by finishing the zones on Azeroth adding Kara and not putting in the things that ruined the game like LFG finders, paid realm transfers, 25 man raids etc, flying mounts etc 
---
Not entirely, it counts after your skill, orange levels stay orange longer same with yellows.
---
[Live to Win!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doFnCzUxLU8)
---
The ONLY change I would advocate for is being g able to inspect people from farther. Someone takes 2 steps and you can’t stalk anymore ); 
---
I agree with this. I do like the changes to some of the classes in BC though. For example, I found that Mages in general were more fun to play. Frost was more interesting, and arcane became an actual spec which I loved. Even Shadow Priests became more interesting. I had a lot of fun playing pvp battlegrounds in BC.
---
I didn’t play Shaman or Druid but I heard that the elemental and balance specs became more viable, and as someone who loves playing casters I am excited at the possibility of playing those classes one day if Classic ever moves into BC. But I’m not sure how they can bring certain class changes from BC without bringing the entire expansion. 
---
While you install
---
Thiiiissssssssssss. I quit in TBC, and every time some person on here references classic servers inevitably rolling into TBC servers, I cringe.
---
Not this time!
---
Seriously, I’ve done the sleepless server first chase too many times.
---
This time I’m going to savor it.
---
Same except it’s a Ti for me.
---
That sir is much more than a WoW computer. Could at least run Minecraft.
---
A lot of people find it more fun to rush. It feels more competitive and it's about pushing yourself to be the best player possible.
---
I luckily have held off of p servers mostly, playing a fuck ton of Monster Hunter currently.
---
&gt;Does +weapon skill matter as much for tanks?
---
Every bit of + hit, crit, glancing blow buff, etc adds to tank damage. 1 point in tank damage is like 40 additional damage from the raid.
---
The better your tank is, the better the raid can be.
---
Try playing WoW when youre homeless.
---
Azeroth was never a barren wasteland during TBC. Why does this keep getting peddled, wow was growing so fast there was an endless supply of new players throughout all zones. Too many people on this soon reference Private Server conditions
---
I have a nice desktop, but when I started taking classes again I got a laptop to bring back and forth to work, do my homework on breaks. I spent the extra 200 on a laptop with a 1050ti on it instead of integrated graphics, just in case I ever play WoW Classic on it.
---
You only need $15 a month for Wow. Quit your job. 
---
I’ll give it a week after launch before someone rips The new models and makes them available, like on p servers.
---
I would personally be fine with changes like those. My line is drawn where the changes start affecting any aspect of the gameplay.
---
Sending multiple mails at once, shift clicking items into the Auction House, being able to dismount when clicking a spell without using an Addon. I dont see any of those as something that affects how the game itself is played and would be fine with it.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Yeah same. Went hard on pservers for the previous 3-4 years, levelled 12 characters to 60. Been taking a year off and will start again when classic comes.
---
Not unless your PC is shutting off because it's getting too hot. 
---
So you play 3 wow accounts on 3 computers are you autistic?
---
Is my 9700K @5GHz and my 1080 Ti enough for rocksolid 144FPS? :P
---
Well those fans usually cost less than $20 so you're good.
---
I do wonder how much is the game and how much is culture.
---
I’ve been playing on a p server for a few months.  Chat is never used, whispers are ignored 75% of the time, and group quests are always someone trying to get a 40+ to do it for them.  It’s pretty lame.
---
Flying mounts is such a shit idea.
---
I most definitely agree with most of what you wrote here, but your post lacks some nuance.
---
1) while I agree that world pvp on a large scale took a hit during TBC, it wasn't the flying mounts that did it, arenas and battlegrounds did. World pvp was still very much a thing in areas that mattered (Elemental plateau, Kazzak, daily quest areas) and flying was actually a better tool for ganking toons still leveling.
---
2) The badge system, while being introduced in TBC, wasn't actually a problem until WotLK. During TBC the gear wasn't the same stuff that was available in raids and the amounts of badges needed for a single piece were so high that it brought balance along: if you were good enough to farm enough badges for a piece of gear quickly (as a non-raider), you were good enough to raid as well. The welfare epics started with WotLK using the same system, but that time offering actual tier drops with incredibly nerfed-to-the-ground content to farm the badges with.
---
The biggest fault really was your first point, the emptying of Azeroth. Karazhan, Zul'Aman and the auction house were the only reasons to leave the outlands, and that set the precedent to the world not mattering. Which is a huge shame, considering it's called the WORLD of Warcraft.
---
Sadly not a literal guerrilla fighter, but as close as it gets.
---
Hey dude,
---
I was going to reply to the other comments but I thought better of it and decided to just come back up to your original here. This isn't a political squabble it's about trying to help a bro out. 
---
Jordan Peterson's 12 Rules For Life is a fine suggestion if you're going through some tough times; it's helped me out over the past year and I'd bet it'd help you too.
---
I hope you find some peace and meaning, man. 
---
Best,
---
T
---
They think it be how it is, but it don't
---
/r/beermoney
---
Yeah, on paper it sounds great but in reality you end up just flying over the world than actually playing in it. 
---
At first it was so cool but after a while I got real tired of looking at the sky xD
---
Agreed 100%. Also, BC destroyed Faction Flavor with giving everyone Paladins and Shamans. Also, Blood Elves for the Horde started the destruction of both the theme and the lore of the game. 
---
Defiantly? Or definitely?
---
wow never thought about it like that. TOC was garbage and it was all downhill from there (although ICC was lit)
---
It doesn't matter what the developers COULD have done. BC is what they did, and it largely emptied out the old world.
---
Vanilla didn't need flying mounts to make repeat gameplay and farming tolerable, so why did BC?
---
Dungeons in vanilla were already repeatable. People farmed them plenty without having a daily chore assigned to do so.
---
There are arguments to be made in favor of a badge system, but that doesn't make such a system "needed". Badge systems have trade-offs, just like most things in life.
---
A complex fight is more difficult for a 40-man raid than a 25-man raid, but that doesn't prevent you from having mechanically complex 40-man raids. It just alters the tuning considerations. As a side note, I think BC really screwed up by having 25-man raids. 40-man raid teams coming from vanilla couldn't split cleanly. And if you were in a newer guild that was moving up the raid progression, you had to merge three 10-man raid teams (leaving out 5 people). It never made sense to me.
---
And I don't understand your TLDR. To whom are you speaking? We aren't making the game better or worse because BC and vanilla are long since made.
---
Yeah, and with less people on the ground, it just became less fun. Less world PvP situations. Much faster to get to places. You could be in an area and avoid PvP by just floating out of range.
---
Sure in Vanilla you had flight paths which meant you weren’t running through the zones on foot all the time, but there is a big difference when you have to use a ground mount to do that last mile. Now you can just point yourself right to the destination and go afk for 2 min. Even with flight paths you could afk for a part of the journey, but you would still often have to traverse dangerous areas.
---
And now max lvl chars could legit drop out of the sky out of nowhere and gank you. Now, I fully support ganking horde scum, but even I say that’s excessive.
---
I'm sort of interested. Raid till 1am on what days? I can do that on Thurs / Fri / Sat but not on nights where I have work the next day.
---
for warriors, add 3-5 levels to the beginning level. 
---
It's impressive (and I love it!), but you left out the most important part: WHER MANKIRK WIF?
---
Well, my plan was to make a good investment now for WoW, but still have something I could still use to run ES VI when it comes out fully modded and maxes settings. I figured this was the best bet, we’ll see tho.
---
I kinda miss 10-15man school, good times.
---
I’ll be honest I like classic,but TBC and Wrath was my jam man.
---
Maybe they felt bad for us after the water quest lol.
---
Absolutely. The best time. If you're new, look into the classes and professions that interest you but don't exhausting yourself. Hardcore players will rush ahead, but there won't be much for them to do until more hit 60. Enjoy the zones and find a friend that compliments your playstyle, whether that's dungeons, quests, exploration, or anything else you come across. Avoid the people that berate or come across as controlling elitists.
---
I think the argument for “Arthas did nothing wrong” can only come from his point of view of “no sacrifice is too much for my people.” However, morally, killing an entire city of “his people” is wrong. I think Uther and Jaina would’ve been on board if they had at least tried cleansing the infection first. 
---
Well, in my case I farmed the materials for thunderfury as a rogue, but the main issue was the same: arcane crystals. Took me about a month of sitting in darkwhisper gorge mining rich thorium to gather all 100 of them, although i got the transmutes for free from guildies. In the case of of Sulfuras you only need 50, so it should be a bit faster. When it comes to the other ingredients (raid-drops), your guild should provide them anyways if you got the Eye of Sulfuras with them. Whether or not farming gold to buy the arcane crystals instead is completely dependant on how the economy on the upcoming classic servers will be like. Just giving some kinda timeline for farming it with mining here.
---
Also, just to point out the drop rates, someone in our guild was saving his dkp for the eye of sulfuras throughout the MC, BWL, and AQ patches, and it NEVER dropped, even though we got multiple thunderfuries in that timespan, so don't take it for granted.
---
Always make sure to get “increased chance to wear leather armour”, “Spirit of the high roll on a 2H Sword”, “Lightning Reflexes” which has a hidden trait which allows you to hit need really quickly on items and then apologize for rolling need when you meant to greed, and finally “improved aspect of the I need spirit gear for mana regen”
---
I think the biggest issue for me with flying mounts was the mob villages.
---
I don't know how to describe it well but within certain zones you often found large areas full of mobs that required a lot of work to get through.  I think a good example is the ZF hammer quest area.  It was an outdoor troll area that I remember being really hard to climb because there were so many mobs in close proximity and you had to trek through a lot of it to get where you wanted.
---
I remember this completely disappearing in BC because I would fly to wherever the quest goal was (in the heart of a well defended orc village or whatever) and fly straight down and only fight the mobs exactly in the proximity of the quest.  Then when done I'd fly away.
---
It removed what I could only call outdoor dungeons.  The areas that previous MMOs had before the heavy change to instanced dungeons.  These were great places to meet new players and form impromptu groups because while possible alone it was easier together.
---
Outdoor dungeons were killed by flying.  Except for caves.  But most caves weren't as big and had re-used layouts and just didn't have nearly the personality the rest of the game world had.
---
I don't think it's a good idea for you to let yourself go that much over a video game. You all have real live obligations like jobs, grooming, exercise and nutrition to name a few. If you're single I think it's okay to give WoW (or any hobby really) 2-3 hours per day, on the weekends when you're not working you can obviously binge it if you wish but don't forget about things like laundry and cleaning your house/apartment.
---
Space goats were a bigger stretch of the lore than Blood Elves ever could be imo.
---
The title is perfect don’t change it !!!
---
yes 100% fuck daily quests! I hope after 2 years of Classic WoW they make an expansion NOT TBC
---
Fair enough. However, other players versions of fun (see elitist responses) is going to be different to your version, or my version of fun. For instance, I’m going to be playing shaman because 1) I miss having a lot of buttons on my screen 2) I like bringing utility to a group and 3) I have no issue with being forced to heal at 60. If that’s not your version of fun then I can’t help you. 
---
Basically, you’re gunna have to find what makes you happy on your own as you will be playing your character and not someone else. The advice I would give you is to avoid starting over and being constantly behind.
---
Oooh dude. That's just sad. Not all classic players are no-lifers.
---
frick you i choose to be a virgin 
---
Doesn't really seem like a /classicwow question. There's a lot of doom and gloom about modern WoW atm but for what it is it's still the best 5man/raid/arena pvp MMO going. Probably the weakest aspects of modern WoW is that levelling feels like a chore and just a means to the end (of the endgame), and that the sense of world/realm community is pretty dead - everything is cross realm/shared/phased so 90% of 'community' now is just your guild. Whether it's worth playing or not probably comes down to what you enjoy doing in MMOs.
---
Haha yeah just realised which sub this is 
---
r/lostredditors I thought I deleted it a minute ago but I guess not. Sorry!
---
His nickname is literally Ghost Wolf
---
Yeah i really miss the vibes of a 15man UBRS too... Likewise for me it was way before MC raids, and the 15man group just made the whole thing feel so much more epic after all the 5man instances during leveling.
---
You think you will but you won't
---
Thanks for the feedback. I'm probably going to go warlock or shadow priest if I'm soloing a lot. I also like healing so might roll one for PuG's. I'm not expecting to hit 60 on any/many characters, back in those days I always tended to fizzle at 35-45 range.
---
I had a job and life when wow launched and still managed five hours of play on work nights.  Weekends were about twenty hours or more.  I still have a job and hope to be able to play as hardcore but am thinking age might not let me....big difference between 22 and 38...
---
You're an idiot he got unbanned you doofus.
---
Great points!!! Totally agree! It ruined a lot of the core game design elements which made WoW great! Outdoor dungeons were so awesome and now they simply can’t exist because they can be skipped. Ugh, it gets worse and worse the more you think about it...
---
S a r c a s m 
---
I will be playing pretty casually and solo as my schedule doesn't really permit party play and/or raiding or dungeons (kids and all).
---
I want to play a class good in pve and fun/durable/able in world pvp. I really enjoyed a Beast Mastery hunter on the private servers. I also enjoyed a shadow priest but not positive about its world pvp ability. What do you guys think?
---
At least own it
---
.
---
Wrong
---
Thanks for the clarification. I'd never heard of that but it makes sense that that could happen and not be widely recognized. 
---
Also doubles my hope that there is just NO loot trading of dungeon loot. Seems to incentivize cheating. 
---
It took more skill to clear heroic Slave Pens than do Lucifron. But the prep required to do Lucifron is much greater than the prep to do Slave Pens. Hit 70, do normal dungeons.
---
The tiny amount of loot dropping in Classic meant that despite MC being easy to clear, it'd still take ages to get full epics when you're competing with 5-10 if not more people for 1 piece of 3 in total that dropped off a boss.
---
Both bro, both.
---
Totally. Frankly kind of jealous you'll be experiencing this with a fresh set of eyes. 
---
Gotta say, TBC &gt; Vanilla.

&gt; Devil's advocate, #nochanges can be consistent with #nochangesfrom1.12 as it regards to talents &amp; launch content,

Well, one of the (many) weirdnesses of the self-proclaimed "#nochanges" movement is that as far as they are concerned it's "#nochanges" to have Molten Core at launch with 1.12 talents, spells and gear, using 2019 computers and internet connections. And to them this is infinitely preferable to daring to touch the sacred numbers on the Molten Core mobs to make the game roughly as challenging as it was with 1.2 talents, spells and gear and 2004 IT equipment. Because "#nochanges".
---
&gt; I'm far from #nochanges, just saying a lot of this sub seems to believe the door is still shuttable at this point
---
A lot of this sub have a lot of weird ideas.
---
I'm probably alone in this, but for me nothing will ever beat WoTLK. 
---
Warcraft 3 was my childhood. So when I finally had the chance to depart to Northrend to start really picking up where WC3 left off, it was absolutely unreal.  And NOTHING could have prepared me for the wrathgate. 
---
An update

Agreed with this.

I leveled during mid tbc and I found plenty of PvP, questing buddies and dungeons. 
---
It depends. Some copypasta in Italy has DOP protection. 
---
I dont think the partner i work with thinks this, but i try my best.
---
I can't wait to do the full gear PVP grind again.
---
I loved being loved by random passerby's
---
That’s true but having the level capped people «locked» to Outlands makes leveling have more pressure because you wanna enter the Outlands club too. In Vanilla you’d see high level people all the time. Azeroth also feels lame in TBC because nothing you do there has any merit whatsoever.
---
I probably wouldnt worry about nature's focus. You definitely do not need the threat talent. Either in Cat or healer form its almost impossible to druid's to get threat in a negative way.
---
What server you on bro?
---
Vanilla class balance tweaked with some Mana talents (from tbc) for hybrid dps would be a nice middle ground. Also, Kara as a raid at same level as naxx, ranging between t2.5 to 3 would be my perfect game. Not that I expect any of that out of classic. One can dream tho
---
Still better than today's motto;
---
"If everybody is the same, we don't need to balance anything!"
---
Two stuns. One daze. One speed boost. One slow.. etc etc.
---
One of the fun things about 15 man UBRS as well was that, because players weren't all that good, you really did need the extra manpower and utility. Also, UBRS has a lot of areas where having 15 men is actually quite disadvantageous, so nerfing it down to 10 made the positioning concerns much less of a hassle.
---
But of course, with 15 players comes even more struggling for loot, and on the whole, it's probably best that it got nerfed down to 10. A lot of people would go through UBRS and get nothing. And while that might not be such a bad thing on the whole, when it took you 3 hours to do UBRS, it really didn't feel good.
---
IMO lots of the azeroth zones gave me a post apocalyptic vibe. You were often questing on the backs of fallen empires.
---
Ashenvale has the warsong supplies quest that gives a blue item for little work.
---
BFD has Gravestone scepter, a must for priest and very good for warlock and mage.
---
And your leveling paths would require an insane amount of grinding. You need to do just about every zone in vanilla. You can skip the occasional zone, but you’ll need to grind to make up for it.
---
There will be servers without streamers. Just pay attention to where you make your character.
---
I never got to outland, always wondered what it looked like
---
It was just the precursor to it.  First they tried balancing the classes while keeping what made them unique.  But uniqueness will be intrinsically unbalanced somehow.  Which led to the eventual homogenization.  More than anything else, I really believe arenas killed WoW.
---
I think you are right, I was level 57 when TBC came out and i enjoyed TBC more. I always wonder what it would have been like to reach endgame, I'm betting it would change my opinion. 
---
2 7
---
Story-wise, yes. It was so epic. But then they added lfg and game over
---
Content is only 'gone' after Cataclysm
---
The best WPVP always goes down in the middle of nowhere, like Feralas or some nothing zone, when there's two groups that just keep calling for more and more backup and it spirals out of control. 
---
Gettysberg happened when the Confederates stopped in town to restock on shoes (pretty sure this is a myth). 
---
I think in Cata you just fly there or take a portal?  I recall that you start at the top (where there's a new world tree?) and work your way down to the firelands.
---
For sure, lfg was a mistake. But the story lived up to the over half a decade of hype leading up to it and that's one of the coolest moments I've experienced in gaming. 
---
for just a quick look where to level next OP's is better
---
In terms of active abilities I think War Stomp is actually one of the best for a hunter. Orc's Blood Fury  is only melee and Troll's Berserking doesn't seem particularly great. You will certainly be a rarity and that's a lot of fun in and of itself. 
---
Lvl 25-30 is such a drag if you're Horde. 
---
I'm out of the loop, what loot change are they making?
---
If you absolutely have to learn anything, classes and professions. Do not pick a hybrid if you don't like healing. Try to stay as blind as you can, read quests and don't add a quest helper.  
---
Enjoy the grind
---
Huh, wasn't Kazzak also the demon that got 3 shotted by a paladin who farmed \~100 stacks of a seal of some sort and then murdered him and instantly got hotfixed? 
---
I for one, can't wait to waste my life on this beautiful masterpiece of a game.
---
Sleeping under an overpass does not give rested experience.
---
The corrupted blood plague in Org was amazing too. I was actually there for that one.
---
Don't forget about glancing blows, from 300-310 vs lvl 63 mobs you have a 40% chance on white hits of doing 70-100% dmg, increasing per point, hurting warrs rage generation and rogues as well for dmg.
---
I can't fucking wait guys 
---
The only thing I can think of is I'm not sure if they'll have the gates to AQ open yet, if they are already opened then you'd miss that, but lore-wise that's not really big anyways. 
---
I would rather have addons do that stuff.
---
Why addons instead of blizzard? You have a better choice between features instead of blizzard chosing eveything for you.
---
Was thinking of going this hybrid myself:

https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hxbuVbhoZVibzV0u 
---
I'd be leveling with a warrior and would do a lot of aoe pulls. Main objective is aoe fire totems and hopefully starting  mobs with chain lightning crits. @56 I'd Respec resto / ele possibly for dungeons, or full resto.
---
This is exactly how I feel. TBC was the peak of wow class design by miles 
---
I’d love informative maps with spawn rate/pathing for Classic, but only from the actual Classic data when it goes up for Alpha/Beta. 
---
Google your question. 
---
If you are looking to do tons of wpvp and want the advantage, leveling as BM is going to be your best shot. I've leveled separate hunters both as BM and Marks, BM hands down is significantly superior in every way with the exception of play style (ie, play the character the way you want to enjoy the game, but one is objectively more effective than the other).
---
Here is an example of a good BM build.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#cV0GdxgoptVohx

If you just want to play as marks, here is what I prefer in terms of survival talents.

This.  
---
I'm the most selfish person in the world and I am always willing to help with stuff like this.  
---
Top damage done? Retail player detected.
---
Just take vacation days. 
---
Thunderfury is considered to be great for tanks and Sulfuras is great for PVP. 
---
Sulfuras is made by combing a rare legendary raid drop with an Epic crafted hammer thats recipe is locked behind a faction.
---
Thunderfury is made by combining TWO legendary raid items, a bunch of other stuff, a quest and then a special boss.
---
Sulfuras is probably easier to get. Which is better? Sulfuras is the coolest, in my opinion. Thundrfury looks a bit ridiculous.
---
You highlighted most of the reasons why I think vanilla is better as well.
---
Faction rivalry. In TBC Alliance has shamans and horde has Paladins. Both factions fight each other in arena. Both factions coexist in Shattrath. I hated this. In vanilla we had actual rivals with players from the other faction and that dissolved in TBC. Some of it was flying meant we didn't see each other where we would fight and we'd only see each other in town where we wouldn't.
---
If TBC comes out, I may play it. It was the best expansion. I did enjoy it. It did fall short of the original vanilla experience though. In TBC, everyone started spending all of their time in instances rather than the actual world. TBC shifted everything to end game and drained the two best designed continents of relevance.
---
To piggyback on this, pick an all DD class like Hunter, Warlock, Mage or Rogue. Tanking and healing have their own quirks and you really need to understand the threat system well to have a handle on those. Also as either tank or healer you will need to be familiar with dungeon encounters somewhat to get through things. There's a lot less pressure as a DD and less consequences for a mistake. Also, DD leveling is comparatively fast and smooth.
---
I did mention those, just under the parts with the chance for each level.
---
I'm doing a bit of research at the moment because i'm finding conflicting sources. I always thought the GB damage reduction decreased more rapidly 300-305 then more slowly 305+ but now I'm not sure. The main source I can find says it's an even reduction of 3% per wep skill point from 30% to 0. It's hard cause there's a lot of misinformation about pservers with dodgy calculations.
---
Who knows what blizzard will implement on classic though, we'll just have to wait and see.
---
I am ways laugh out loud at the “intimidating shout”
---
This is perfect, thanks a bunch for that awesome summary. 
---
Zang and Nagrand were amazing. I literally don't even ever the names of the other zones. 
---
This is why I still have questions its hard to know for sure.
---
Couldn’t disagree more, I was a better player in TBC even though I raided Naxx in Vanilla and the whole time I was playing TBC I knew it would be my last expansion. So many features that would later destroy WoW were introduced, I was amongst the people totally against flying mounts and Arena at the time not just years later. People forget now how unpopular it was to be against stuff like flying mounts and arena back then, most of the people against these things now use to call people like me complainers.
---
Wailing caverns is also at the wrong spot it even days Wailing caverns on the map!
---
They need to recreate this when classic is released 
---
I do not share the same opinion, but thank you for sharing a bright spot in TBC. 
---
All factions living in same capital, never seeing one another because of flying and all content being in instances. Factions having the same classes. They killed the two best continents in WoW history with TBC rather than building onto them.
---
For those reasons, class design was not enough to make me enjoy TBC because the world part was dead. Lots of RPG's have good class design. WoW is supposed to be an MMO and the vanilla was the only true MMO.
---
Turn up the resolution to 200%
---
Yet
---
Slippery slope again.. yawn.
---
Silithus was pretty empty at launch as well. It didn't become a spot to be in until after bwl when the aq stuff was added.
---
Everything you mentioned positively about TBC has nothing to do with world, community, etc sadly. Those are the characteristics of an MMO.
---
Addons cannot replicate the functionality of auto looting without pressing shift. No such addon even exists for Vanilla.
---
I don't think arenas killed wow. Since they could still be in the game. It was the compromising and balancing that blizzard did due to it, they killed classes.
---
Be a gnome. When I see a gnome warrior with a 2h running around I book it in the other direction regardless of what I'm playing.
---
Power to you. TBC was hallow to me. The world felt dead. I would fly around never seeing anyone. I'd go to Shattrath and there the horde was... Faction rivalry dead. We all have the same classes now. In arena, alliance fights alliance. Horde fights horde. All relevant content is now end game. Original continents are now nearly desolate since all end game content has been shifted to outlands.
---
I can agree that classes and professions were exceptional, but those are characteristics of a good RPG. They killed every thing that makes an MMO great in other areas. I wish they would have built onto the original continents rather than sending us to different worlds and islands. Just my two cents.
---
Just because they've said it doesn't mean it will happen.
---
I'm looking forward to the sense of community that Vanilla had and most of all the challenge. I stopped playing before MoP dropped and just recently returned. To me the game now feels like easy mode. 
---
FYI, addons cannot replicate the functionality of auto looting without pressing shift. No such addon even exists for Vanilla.
---
Warlocks are the toughest cloth casters in the game, they usually have more stamina than mages. Bursting them down is rarely an option. You can't outlast a warlock because their dots are stronger than your hots and you will go oom sooner than them.
---
I mean, I get where you're coming from, because it definitely didn't feel like Warcraft in the same sense as vanilla. But like 60-70% of the mobs were demons, spirits, orcs and ogres. From Hellfire to Shadowmoon Valley.
---
But yeah, I always hated the space ship and space cow bullshit. Same reason I hated the panda expansion, it just felt tacked on and not very Warcraft. I remember when the draenei rumors started popping up, thinking it'd be the broken draenei in Swamp of Sorrows that look menacing as hell. I would've been totally down for them, minus the Star Trek bullshit.

Maybe? We're probably all somewhere on the spectrum.

I meant over time I've changed my rig, built a new one because better hardware was available but the most I've rolled with was a single machine at a time. I've paid the subs on my own accounts and for family on occasion. I had 2 live accounts for several years though.
---
I didn't talk about loot features though?

And well, technically you can, its possible to edit at least the old vanilla client so you autoloot, it's not an addon but close enough.

You can use the links to see what you need and where they come from.

&gt; You only need one of the bindings of the windseeker to get this [item](https://vanillawowdb.com/?item=19016#objective-of) from the guy in silithus. This starts a Legendary quest for the thunderfury questline. You need both bindings, essence of the firelord which drops off of ragnaros only if you have the quest, and 10 elementium bars

Gold(prolly devilsaur) and prebis.

Without ranking from the start rushing to 60 really doesn't give you much of an advantage, you get a couple more MC clears but even that isn't worth much if blizzard goes somewhat blizzlike release schedule. The only real benefit is being able to farm a billion lotus/richthorium/devilsaur.
---
Totally agree on Hinterlands. I wish I had more reasons to be there. 
---
Totally fair opinion but you really highlighted why some people would want to bring BC back over Vanilla. It’s because that’s when that group started playing (or really got into the game). Again totally fair reason, but it doesn’t tell us much about the relative quality of the experiences of both games like people like to discuss/debate. The reason vanilla is coming back is become it was just an amazing experience and WoW at its peak. 
---
No.
---
Most people work on important stuff instead of mounts when they ding. The only reason to ever go for mount first is if you plan on ranking, which according to blizzard won't be possible on launch.
---
I feel bad for every night elf ever
---
Man. Reviewing this for a few minutes just reminded me of how terrible and chaotic it was to level once you got to 35 and gave up on stv.
---
People who love BC love it because that’s when they first really played wow. People I know who experienced deep end game vanilla at the time know BC was still a truly great game but really was the start of slow trickle of ‘additions’ to the game that ruined it with unforeseen (unforseeable?) downsides. 
---
They are missing the Marshals Refuge flight point in Un'Goro.
---
&gt;But like 60-70% of the mobs were demons, spirits, orcs and ogres. 
---
Dude what?
---
Totally agree. Wish they added on to vanilla by finishing and adding new encounters instead of all the selling points that ended up detracting a lot from the game world. Although I admit that itemizing even more powerful gear post naxx without increasing the level cap and in a way to keep the game fair and fresh is not an easy task. 
---
Numbers 3 and 4 I totally agree with. heroic dungeons to me just felt like repetitive content. It’s just the same dungeon twice with the same but slightly shinier gear, just lazy design. Arena was also new and interesting and definitely added something great in a way but had the unintended effect of constantly messing up class balance for PvE and started the game down the route of homogenizing classes. 
---
When you say ‘played both religiously’ do you mean you did end game vanilla content as it was released? Everyone who prefers BC to me seems like they didn’t actually experience peak end game vanilla right after release. 
---
If they have a collectors edition I will buy it.  The circle will now be compete a Diablo, and whatever collectors stuff they have. 
---
It would probably change your opinion if you played end game vanilla wow before BC release. 
---
One of the main reasons to go gangbuster.  Get out of the vale before professional gankers are there in mass numbers.
---
True most people didn’t see it coming and we’re kinda blindly accepting blizzard’s design choices because they had obviously knocked it out of the park so far. kinda funny in retrospect and in today’s climate. 
---
Gotta love the "Authentic San Marzano Tomatos"
---
yeah i'm really hoping the beta data can be pulled ahead of time to see these things and plan ahead before jumping into levelling.
---
Agreed. I was playing since vanilla retail wotlk and replaying these against as an adult I can easily see vanilla is the superior game.
---
Blizzard is being harmed because you are hosting a game server for their product and taking away potential customers. WoW is absolutely being supported to this day, and you not liking the current version doesn't change that.
---
"But the people playing pservers won't play retail."
---
No. There is no way for anyone to know this. Fact is that Blizzard is losing at least *some* amount of money because players are able to scratch their WoW itch easily without a sub on private servers.
---
"But there was no way to play earlier versions"
---
I never understood this idea that just because a game business does not provide the specific version of the product you prefer, it somehow justifies theft of the product. This entire argument is based on the assumption that WoW's different versions are entirely different products on their own which (even if you *feel* so) just isn't true.
---
You are playing on illegitimate servers using illegally downloaded copies of the game. Piracy through and through. The reason you have somehow jumped though these logical hoops to convince yourself otherwise is because the first time in your life there exists something that you *really really* want and can only be accessed through immoral means i.e piracy, and instead of admitting that you prefer to tell yourselves that the means isn't immoral.
---
Total intellectual dishonesty.
---
Probably not a long one. They have internal testers and FAF that can test these things.  There is no balancing going on.  Strictly translation that is all. So the only thing they need to do is make sure everything is working.  Of course when Zandalr comes out someone WILL try the Hakarr blood thing=D
---
gear yourself in mostly blues and a strong wep, and take the fight to them first if its 1v1
---
I think it could've been good were it really limited. Like shooting a flare up to get a 30 second ride up to a plateau of enemies.
---
Depends.  Do you like some Danger?   Or are you a killing machine.  If you just want to grind grind grind a mage.  If you want to live dangerously then rogue spelunking in dungeons.
---
Classic wow isnt out yet 
---
I had to do about 20 stealth runs to get my Shanker.  I finally got the Dal Rend after about 6 months in game.  
---
Another reason why Hoomans are the bestest!
---
It wasn't added until Patch 1.11.0, so it's not surprising the strategy guide didn't have it.
---

I ran circles in WPL for few days farming crystals, got around 15 crystals as gifts from various people.
---
Cores and Ignots were provided by guild.

Transmutes i got in trade chat 5g a pop.

Other mats i don't remember but probably few hundred gold.
---
All in all i was done in few days after i got the eye.
---
If you don't see how DM at launch affects *everyone*, I really can't help you. You haven't read my posts, you haven't watched what I linked. Why should I discuss anything with you?
---
Part of it could be culture, but then again I would say the culture on Pservers is going to be different from official servers - if for no other reason than half the players may not speak the same language.
---
To your first question - one thing the history of WoW has made clear is that players in games will almost always take the path of least resistance, even if it ultimately makes them unhappy. If socialization is not required to succeed, they won't, and consequently they wont develop the kinds of social bonds that made the game special.
---
Bookmarking this for screenshots later.
---
Not a very populated one then. I visited several and lfg was always full of random talk in the active ones - and by random talk I mean the one besides the usual icc requests or ppl tryna sell glyphs and gems linking their prof.
---
I hope if classic vanilla is a big hit they do classic BC two or three years down the line. I'll go there. If they do it then I hope they also offer eternal vanilla servers for those that want it.
---
Oh fuck I have that Prima guide somewhere too.  *digs*
---
MM when leveling is nice only if you get a strong ranged weapon and replacing it every few levels. BM is just so much more convenient, due to pet already scaling though levels and the strong buffs it gets from talents.  But it also becomes its bane since at 60 pet stops scaling at all by itself and then is when MM become the one to use.  
---
There were raids and dungeons in azeroth in BC
---
Yup! Pretty standard hybrid build. It's a consistent and fast build that I've tested before in my leveling guides
---
I agree, they should think about releasing a tbc server in the future once classic progresses but this time without shutting down the classic server ( just transfer your character to the bc server).
---
Barren wasteland is a stretch. But if you played before TBC and then after TBC, there was a significant drop in the players in Azeroth. The only time you really saw people above level 60 was when they had to return to Azeroth to use the auction house.
---
I even played on "Low" Pop server and found plenty of dungeons/PVP opportunities.
---
Exactly. The social aspect was already butchered in TBC. It was not just LFG in Wrath that ruined it. That was just the final nail in the coffin.
---
rofl
---
I agree with that about heroics but because most dungeons were low level and became irrelevant at max, it was a good idea in order to increase relevant content at level cap. On the other hand, Heroic raids was a bad idea because raids are already endgame content and they are literally asking to do the same raids twice because they don't want to come up with more content.
---
Woah slow down buddy, this was ONLY available after you had already hit lvl 70, meaning that almost all outdoor questing at that point was only for gold, not for gear or dungeon/raid progression. 58-69 were on ground exactly like in the good old days.
---
Flying had its issues, but to say that world pvp was dead is simply not true. Any place with mobs that drop valuable items would be a pvp shitshow (think the southern area in Shadowmoon Valley with the air elementals) because some crafting materials were a really scarce resource.
---
And even then, TBC provided so much depth to all the classes as well as arena that I am fine with having a little less world pvp for that.
---
Hint: nobody who is awaiting classic has any skills. 
---
I’m with you. Slow, enjoyable leveling process. Make some friends, get ganked, do some ganking. I want the whole experience 
---
I really hope you expansion happy babies don't ruin Vanilla a second time.
---
Sulfuras has a high chance of going to a shaman or a paladin, based on historical evidence.  
---
Thunderfury is absolutely going to the guild's main tank first. If you're that guy, you get Thunderfury.  
---
Thunderfury then typically goes to primary OT. If you're that guy, you get Thunderfury #2 a considerable time later.  
---
I've seen guilds dick off with a third Thunderfury by giving it to a DPS which is a strange decision in my mind, but hey you might get lucky.  
---
I'm maining a warrior in Classic and I will be DPS.  
---
I expect to never receive Thunderfury, and if the guild decides I should get Hand of Ragnaros, I will accept it because I'm greedy, but I will feel a deep pit of guilt every time I see the paladins in my guild.  
---
And then promptly forget about it when I look at my Hand of Ragnaros because it's so fucking cool looking.  
---
First of all - I love vanilla and TBC content and played in both of them
---
But for god's sake I can't understand the amount of people dickriding vanilla so hard and claiming that everything else destroyed wow
---
TBC was glorious and while it begun to introduce some more questionable options like flying mounts it was still peak wow performance period
---
In vanilla some classes were just fucking unplayable (you wanna play paladin other than holy? - go fuck yourself) and overall balance of class mechanics was at least to say inconsistent and overstuffed with flawed concepts. It literally lead to dead, useless content which I hate (I still remember dampen magic as mage main and there was a lot of useless garbage like that spell)
---
In TBC they've fixed most of the bad shit without starting to remove diversity, fun and challenge (they've started to simplify the game in wotlk and straight murdered it in cata)
---
True. They're just unrealistic :P
---
Worth noting that unless you're tanking (if you are a warrior pre-naxx you probably will be), you won't be getting a TF. 
---
Innervates however will be given to the best priest in the raid group. Only in a miniscule amount of cases a druid would give innervate to himself. 
---
OOC you normally just drink and do not take into account how much you might regen in 10seconds.
---
A raid lead would really not be all too pleased if people sacrifice raid performance on endurance fights such as C'thun, 4HM or Sapphiron and the likes.
---
One could argue that once you obtain 8/9 T3, you ditch Deviate Growth Cap but if you directly take both caps in a contest, I'd say Deviate Growth Cap comes out ontop.
---
grooming  (͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
---
You're the definition of evil all that all our videogames warn us about.
---
Why do i not want Nope or apes?
---
Dont be, its a rite of passage!
---
Yeah... if they do that (I would bet money they will) I would honesty spend a LONG time subbed. I subbed nonstop from ‘05 til Dragon Soul in Cata... and they still might keep me subbed for a longer consistent time if they do that. Honestly though, I hope they take longer before they release BC and Wrath this time. Let the content really breath and let Blizzard milk them this time, ya know? I want to be able to do Naxxramas and Sunwell but have the time to work my way up to it, without devoting my next 6 years 5 hours a day to being the top raider for each xpac.
---
It's a different game then current WoW.
---
Personally, I'll play because of that. I loved Warcraft1-3 (the RTSs which came before WoW). But I wasn't into multiplayer so I passed on WoW. Later I discovered that it's worth it but by then it was too late. (That was around when the Cataclysm expansion was released.)
---
Since then current WoW became increasingly unappealing. Basically it changed into a shitty action RPG, gameplay wise, the story jumped the shark many times and they only accelerated their tendency to mangle any content not the latest, making it basically unplayable. Current WoW is always just the "endgame", the few current dungeons, raids and and other gameplay elements (which are basically "do this mindless stuff each day"). All that years worth of content supposedly there is just a mirage. You can go look at it but that's it.

So if you like a flashy game where you collect flashy things and don't care about story or gameplay (mostly), current WoW might be for you.
---
If you do care about the story and a much slower paced and more thoughtful gameplay, Classic WoW might be for you.
---
(This is, of course, my opinion, simplified and exaggerated. I can also recommend playing on a private server to get your feet wet and see for yourself. Just don't get carried away. Leave some playtime for the real thing. :)
---
&gt; I think a good example is the ZF hammer quest area. It was an outdoor troll area that I remember being really hard to climb because there were so many mobs in close proximity and you had to trek through a lot of it to get where you wanted.
---
The Mallet of Zul'Farrak quest disappeared with Cataclysm, though, so you were never able to skip it by flying.  
---
Also, flying in Azeroth, also introduced by Cataclysm, is available only at 60th level, making all the classic zones grinding areas, instead of questing ones.  
---
In TBC you could fly from 70th, only later (Patch 3.2.0 - Call of the Crusade) it was lowered to 60th level, when they lowered all levels of riding (20th/40th/60th) in order to help players speed up leveling to reach WotLK.  
---
All this said, even the leveling experience in Cataclysm was **not** impaired by being able to fly, since the quests almost always took place at ground level; the only advantage of flying was not to have to go miles to reach that peak right above you, which is something I fully agree with.
---
Cataclysm added so much to WoW, reinvigorated old zones with outdated visuals, and added so much cool stuff to the game.
---
Sure there we a couple of downsides but they added so much cool stuff it's worth it.
---
I hope they don't stop at boring TBC and keep adding awesome expansions to the game.
---
The worst thing they could do is just keep the game at Vanilla. That's boring, there's barely anything to do. Classic would die very quickly if they don't add expansions.
---
Yeah. TBC perfected what vanilla built a framework for.
---
I would enjoy a sweet hybrid server, sometime AFTER they release the trilogy. That way everyone gets what they want, undiluted and tainted. 
---
But I think it would be a cool last-hurrah for the trilogy, a decade or so down the road. Maybe make all content level 60, give the last 20 levels the option of traversing the portal or riding the portal, have talents/spells a healthy balance between Vanilla, BC, and Wrath. 
---
If they really tried, and cross examined every piece of content and power, they could make one excellent mass of game. Imagine Azeroth tied with Outland and Northrend, all with relevant level 60 content? Imagine doing Blackrock Depths in the morning, Karazhan in the afternoon, and Ulduar at night. All on the same toon with a balance of spells from the trilogy. No fan of knives, or any homogenizing spells like that. 
---
I can dream too, but I also kind of want that. But again, I want to experience each expansion as it was, before I experience it in such a revamped way, even if the revamped way is for the better.
---
8/8
---
If you’re serious, I’d be very interested in videos of this.  I always wondered how one could even consider prot with just how unforgiving it seems.  In a leveling and PvP capacity.
---
NO
---
Vanilla had the entire world of Azeroth as content, TBC only had Outland.
---
Im kinda hoping they do the original trilogy but I would allmost rather see them add on to Classic on a new set of realms, kinda like what of TBC was not a expansion pack but a patch. And they didnt add flying, kept the whole world (Azeroth &amp; Outland) meaningfull.
---
&gt; kept the whole world (Azeroth &amp; Outland) meaningfull.
---
I'm sure Activision Blizzard is capable of designing content for Vanilla within these design goals. I trust them to add content to or alter Vanilla 100%.
---
While servers are inevitably down/full for the first night, as is tradition 
---
Played both religiously, as in almost every day, for most of their existence, and enjoyed every moment of being in the cult :)
---
I didn’t experience end-game content, in fact, I only got to 55. I have since, and fought through all of the raids except Naxx and AQ40. But to counter that, I didn’t do endgame content in BC either, so that really is a moot point! I was stuck doing Karazhan and Heroics, Gruuls once or twice, but I was happy being stuck there. 
---
Many see 10 mans existing as a detriment. But to tell the truth, some of the most fun I’ve had since revisiting classic is in UBRS. Even in Vanilla, I love paying with a tight knit group, fighting a handful of bosses that can be difficult, and I can form my own group when I want, with some friends and Guildies. 
---
And I’d like to add, I experienced the best part of Vanilla, even back in the day. 1-60, the leveling experience, is absolutely the best part of Vanilla compred to any other title in WoWs existence. I got to do that, be a part of the community and fight awesome 5 man bosses. To this day, not clearing Naxx isn’t a negative, it’s a positive, it’s sometbing to strive for, with an air of obscurity to it. Something BC also had!
---
I agree, low drops gave items a level of obscurity. I can say, I’m still
---
glad they upped it a bit later. It was kind of overboard in some xpacs, where a 25hc boss would drop more than 7 items in cases... like, Jesus, take it easy.
---
As far as forming the groups, I’ve found that, for the easier half of raids, half of many formed groups members are pugs, whereas 25 mans were 90% guild members, since only needing 25 people to rely on was a much more... reliable system. They both have their strengths and weaknesses, which is why I am glad to (hopefully) have both to enjoy in the future!
---
LOL, let the huntard hate flow.  Also before 40 or so hunters benefit a lot from spirit.  After that drinking is almost always required for regen so spirit becomes a lot less useful.
---
If you do finish the maps, you should include a section that shows unique loot per mob. For example if the rare only drops a random green, it's not noteworthy, but if you're making a note of the rare in Silverpine Forest that drops the Black Tabby Cat, then it is noteworthy.  
---
All snarkiness aside dude I'm dead serious. I did it from 1.5.x up until Pandaria on retail, then again on Nost. Was consistently on top in WSG/AV score screen. Race didn't matter, one of those prot warriors was a gnome. It was 10% spec, 10% gear, 40% skill, and 40% knowing how to macro properly.
---
But damn if it doesn't feel good clicking that green exclamation point. Checkpoint reached!
---
I have three goals for Classic:
---
- Create a guild
---
- Expand my circle of friends
---
- Raid Naxxramas, as I was previously too young to do so but now I’ve got much more time on my hands
---
&gt; Flying had its issues, but to say that world pvp was dead is simply not true.
---
I lost all interest in wPvP after someone I was fighting rezed up, mounted his flying mount and followed me around mocking my inability to harm him.
---
OMG I can't freaking wait!!!!!
---
Good luck on your lonely, lonely journey.
---
You won’t be able to run dungeons without your friends picking fights outside.
---
You won’t be able to do elite quests without your friend picking fights.
---
Not that hard actually. Whenever you see someone from the opposing faction, just die.
---
Or redridge... fucking horde campers
---
*Download the PTR and play on that* Yes theres not many people online there but its free. You want a taste of the game then do it there. Don't spend money on it if you aren't sure. Or if you can wait, just wait till summer when your classic sub lets you play it. But you can find much better use of even a measly 15$ than playing retail honestly.
---
I can confidently say that I will not be grouping with outsiders at any point during my 1 to 60 journey.  
---
But can't I just attempt to walk past them first? :P
---
Nah, just use an addon.
---
We say no to even the small stuff because its always used as an onramp later by some jackass who wants to harm the core of the game.
---
Use an addon. Same for mailing items etc etc.
---
&gt; why on earth would you want bunch of bloated addons
---
What the fuck kind of computer are you using in 2019 that you would consider CLASSIC addons to be "bloat". They barely take any memory at all. Did you look at your games footprint and performance during the demo?
---
In a raid setting warlocks are a support class who do some damage.  The reality is that at every tier mages have you beat. In the first two tiers hunters have you beat as well. In addition to doing lower damage than those classes you also do more threat than them. This is because your main damage spell (Shadow Bolt) has the same threat modifier as a warrior's Heroic Strike. If you crit on two in a row you might as well have taunted the boss which means the correct way to respond to critting one is to sit on your hands and do no damage for a bit.  
---
I'm only exagerrating slightly.  
---
If you care deeply about competing for the top of the dps meters in raids then roll a warrior or... a warrior... maybe a rogue on alliance side.  
---
If you want to roll a ranged class and be competitive then roll a mage and be prepared to wait through two full raid tiers before you get to play your class' actual best dps spec in raids. Even then warriors still probably have you beat, especially horde side.  
---
Warlocks are a really great class. Terrific in PvP and for farming and they provide really important utility in the form of soulstones, health stones, buffs, debuffs and CC (banish in MC in particular). They do get more competitive as content progresses as well. Overall though they are absolutely not the pick if your principal concern is topping meters.
---
druid is heroic mode, and can't equip \[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker\]
---
I definitely remember 10 manning UStrat. Our gear was terrible and people were bad with mechanics back then.
---
No, you must die! Can’t accidentally get an HK credit.
---
TBC already had a few bad decissions imo:  
---
\- Resilience  
---
\- Flying Mounts  
---
\- Outlands, the world used to be big in kalimdor, in TBC you move to Outlands and suddenly your playing area became 10x smaller, there was no reason to go back to kalimdor in TBC.  
---
\- Alliance / Horde shared city, i personally disliked this, kills the whole Alliance vs Horde feeling  
---
TBC brought a lot of good additions too tho. 
---
The big problem is that flying is not even fun, it feels just like walking or riding a ground mount, you just in the air, if it was atleast SUPER ENTERTAINING to fly, the downsides could be worth it, but nope, its boring and mindless, literally only gives you the ability to skip content and become immune to PVP =/ 
---
Once you reached Outland there was NO REASON to go back to kalimdor EVER, untill Cataclysm lol.
---
I played on lights hope for a while got to level 15 and quit because I felt it getting too addicting and I didn't want to waste it on a private server as well. 
---
I personally think they did, epics should drop from monsters i kill, not from a vendor.
---
http://captaindraenei.ytmnd.com/
---
I doubt they would make legacy servers for each expansion and even if they did, they probably wouldn't make Cata servers because literally millions of people quit  in the first few month's  of Cata from player peak in WotLK. I imagine the servers people would want most ther than classic is BC/WotLK.
---
That's just my opinion though, I'm sure they will do whatever makes them the most money.
---
I love nagrand, but there is many zones i love way more in kalimdor than Nagrand personally. Like Stranglethorn Vale, the whole jungle / pirate theme is awesome, booty bay and everything, just one example :D 
---
Dude I have a fucking serious job that I've worked hard on for a decade. I'm gonna annual the shit out of wow classic on launch! Cannot wait. 7 days of grind =D
---
What is grooming ?
---
They need to create the ultimate WoW by taking the good aspects of expansion while leaving the bad, it would be so easy to look back and just remove all the bad decissions. And all of the changes should be added "on top" of vanilla, perferable by starting with finishing the vanilla zones they never finished :) 
---
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child\_grooming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_grooming)
---
" it was still peak wow performance period"  
---
My OpInIoN iS tHe OnLy OpInIoN
---
So many area's that could get new content :)
---
Was t6 from a vendor? I knew there were a few equivalent items that would drop, but not the actual tier. 
---
I rather enjoy having Badges as a way to get low-tier filler items, when really fleshing out your toon to start with at 70. I think it would be a much better system to only buy the rank 2 and rank 3 badge gear with badges from that parallel raid, equal to or lower. 
---
That might verge on being too much like WotLK's flawed system, but at least it gives each badge their own purpose, and not some weird trade-back catch up mechanic funkiness that it later was.
---
Also, with 25 mans and higher loot drops, people could gear up much easier. Thats not necessarily a bad thing, I like the idea of getting loot *slightly* faster than in Vanilla, just a slightly higher drip of reward, but I get the strengths of both systems.
---
Now, when they re-do WotLK, i beg you Blizzard, please, PLEEEEASE fix your weird-ass system, and don't let us buy tier gear from AFK "highend" 5-man content.
---
&gt; weird ass-system

---
Still don't like that idea, because you can still utilize flying to avoid any and all unfavorable situations. It's essentially a godmode button, even if you were only able to fly for 30seconds.
---
Yes yes absolutly yes
---
Literally the best possible chance we will all have in our lifetimes. If your a fan of slower paced mmorpg type games. Please do yourself the favor and check classic out.
---
Strat was 10 man and ubrs was 15 man. 
---
That is what I remember. 
---
I honestly don't remember ever running lbrs or scholo as 10 man. 
---
Nice b8 m8 i r8 8/8
---
My body's ready.
---
I couldn't imagine healing as a druid on alliance, having to compete with holy paladin with healing touch rank 4 that has a longer cast time, higher mana cost, and less (base) healing. Dang, I'd be tempted to go the rejuv spam route. 
---
The only reason to not go human imho is to easily sweep up all the axes and fist weapons no one else wants.
---
Honestly, fuck that. I did loads of world exploration and PVP in vanilla. When Flying mounts were introduced, it ruined the entire game for me (not an exaggeration). Suddenly everyone had a godmode button where they could instantly get to safety, including me. It took away the feel that the world was big and dangerous......because I could just press one button and be 1000 miles in the sky away from everything.
---
1,000.0 miles ≈ 1,609.3 kilometres ^(1 mile ≈ 1.6km)

---
I can tolerate that. But that does not mean i like that. Nochanges all the way.
---
I had a rogue on private server with felstriker, distracting dagger, muggers belt+ full pre raid BIS.
---
I was almost always top DPS early game. Felstriker might be bugged on private servers so take that into account.
---
Yep I do agree with that, it’s funny that wow ended up killing me ow after all ( deviating severely form the successful formula, thanks ion) and only old wow will revive wow.
---
&gt; Selling the wow token completely eliminates that.
---
It doesn't. On retail there are still people buying gold from black market, there is still gold spamming and people advertising runs for real money.
---
The purpose of the token is to make Blizzard earn more money for subs paid with gold (20$ instead of 15 and no discounts for multiple months like you get for real money).
---
It also encourages people who'd never buy gold from black market because of all the risks and scamming.
---
Blizzard already has all the advantages of the token on retail, bringing it on classic would be high costs for no return (they'd have to set up a dedicated infrastructure since they couldn't use the existing one that's global per region), that's why I don't believe it'll happen.
---
Not bringing the token to classic will also encourage some people to play retail (don't forget retail is their flagship) because if you want to pay your sub with a token you have to grind retail (or trade gold, but that's more difficult than grinding it yourself).
---
I guess that blizzard classic will be a huge druidfest... the most nostalgic class, probably
---
the /script CastSpell() and /in 3 /cast macaros will definitely not work
---
That was kind of the point though, Outland was supposed to feel alien and unfamiliar, it wasn't supposed to be the definitive Warcraft experience in that way, it was trying to be its own thing.
---
I really enjoyed legion. Actually had a fantastic story and the gameplay was fun.
---
I tried BFA but only made it to level 115 and then unsubbed.
---
I'd definitely check it out
---
You clearly didn't listen to Brian Birmingham.
---
I know people who like Classic and TBC have always seen Wotlk as the beginning of downfall, but I'd add it there too. Story wise, class design and overall gameplay, everything was just so good. In my opinion of course, it was the perfect balance between the older and the new WoW. 
---
As much as I'm hyped for Classic, if they'd every release Wotlk official servers I wouldn't touch retail ever again.

i will play 16 hours a day and theres nothing you can do about it
---
&gt; I suppose if it is the last classic patch some content will be gone?
---
No. In fact, the opposite. Later patches added some quests here and there.
---
Calm down, Lucifer.
---
Leveling in vanilla came with its own motivation. You really felt incrementally stronger with each level. In modern wow, especially at later levels, you could go multiple levels without a new ability/talent/whatever. In vanilla it's like \*boom\* level 27. Ok I just got a talent point and I can see the immediate improvement in my character. I can probably get into a Razorfen Kraul group in a level or two since levels actually matter a great deal when fighting tough mobs. Oh and I can wear that new armor I picked up. And next level I get to go to town to train and see what cool new shit I can learn. Got a bunch of cool looking skills but they cost a bunch of silver so I need to pick which ones are important now if I don't want to be broke. Oh man in a few levels I'll hit 30 and hit a big power boost.
---
And some of us just aren't interested in that side of the game. I'm sorry, but defeating the Defias or helping a fake farm against wolves means nothing to me. 
---
No its just the combination of the badges + gear beeing dropped as tokens + no 40man raids that made getting full T6 or any gear for that matter much much faster.
---
oof
---
I remember an interview about the episode they said pretty much everyone in the office was playing WoW at the time, even during work hours. But Matt and Trey had no idea what the game was before that. Trey said this episode specifically was the most stressful episode of the series. He said he thought it sucked and would be the end of the show (at that time).
---
It's fun for a moment. Then you realise all your effort put in goes down the drain every patch and you stop caring. 
---
Quinn will probably be the biggest one, he pulls like 5k so should be interesting how he affects faction balance. 
---
Ye, that part kinda sucks.. Can't wait for summer.
---
So you like MMORPGs without the MMO part?
---
Hinterlands for alliance is lower than for horde. Horde should get there around 45-50 for those juicy jin atalor quests (I know, not efficient xp per hour wise)
---
Ur innervate is really important to the priest don’t worry hun 
---
Magram is a cooler name to me than Gelkis. For the simple crime of having a less cool name, all Gelkis must be driven before me or die, to the sound of the lamentations of their putrid women.
---
an other reason would be pvp. 
---
Westfall is the best! It’s like a mini version of the entire game with The Deadmines coming in at the end. I love the lighthouse quests. There’s rare mobs with awesome drops. Deadmines with its parrot pets and Cookies Stirring Rod.
---
Some good old fashioned world PvP. Fighting each other for nothing more than to prove how pathetic the other guy is. How badly they need to remake their character and get good and tell their loved ones how little they deserve to exist after a night of being thoroughly embarrassed emasculated 
---
Your right doesnt completely eliminate it. But would you rather risk account security your payment method etc, or just buy it strait from blizzard and not worry about those issues ?
---
I do 100% think a token would really hurt classic wow. Gold is so much more valuable in terms of what type of power it can buy you in game. Either way I'm going to play classic wow lol. Just the ability to know my characters will be safe and not subject to corrupt server admins is more than enough to get me to play regardless
---
And Booty Bay 😍
---
LEFT SIDE! EVEN SIDE! MANY WHELPS! NOW! HANDLE IT!
---
I would despise a "whole" WoW going mobile but their retail pokemon battle pet would do IMO, not that I would play it but it seems fitting to me.
---
Can u not
---
But there are absolutely parallels between the two. A regulated and controlled market is almost always going to be the better option.
---
I wish it weren't the case, but it is what it is
---
Hmm well the picture is right but for me TBC is a bit better than vannila :)   I liked vannila a lot it was fun to raid with other 39 ppl :)   But the main thing,  what made the best game for me, that I love so much was TBC with Karazhan and SSC and TK and Mount Hyjal and Black Temple and dungeons and attunements and quest chains.  Together with that nice 9 hours of music...
---
Just make it unusable while in combat.
---
literally was about to post  this phrase.
---
Yes.
---
Nagrand reminded me of STV. I was stoked when I ran into Nesingwary there
---
They are burstable if they are not sl.
---
As for outlasting them, hot, decurse agony, and kite/reset fight if needed.
---
There is no way that this is a professional survey. Wtf are some of these questions that do not even have answers? “Describe your feelings - others”. Wtf? 
---
I know people will say TF for tank, but there is a weird coding scenario where Rag is also good for tanking.
---
They should stop at WOTLK. The peak of wow
---
Don't worry, there are people who still call rogues "rouges". The greatest shame belongs to them.
---
I don't even want to estimate Dwarves. 400lbs easy I'd bet.
---
At the time it was technical decision to make new continent. They just couldn't add more stuff to excising world. But their original idea was south seas expansion which would have sounded more appealing to me than Outlands.
---
Cant wait for s3 to get that sweet 1850+ bow for my huntard again.
---
Also beasting down players with my Stormherald warrior. 🤗
---
Live to win
---
right now right now 🤘
---
It is known
---
You got flying at 68 
---
A mix you fly on a dragon through a portal get to see firelands abit and then land up north
---
They are a random drop from brd level mobs. Someone put them on the ah for 35g on zeth'kur and a mage guildy grabbed them. 2017 and someone put edgemasters up for 35g. 
---
2-3 hours? twwooo to threeeeee hooourrsss?? boy stop playing 
---
Is it one of those with increased xp rate?
---
It made sense in a stone-paper-scissors situation.
---
Class identity was far more evident, since you didn't only have the upsides, but also the downsides.
---
Warris lost 9 out of 10 fights to frost mages. This made the one win feel really rewarding though.
---
Imho blizzard reinvented the wheel on the wrong level. F.e. Stance dance wasn't the most intuitive thing to do, but it left you with a really really nice learning curve. 
---
Also the span for mediocre players had a much higher acceptance area - especially compared to everything that came after wod, where 10 item level push you straight into irrelevance. 
---
The way it's meant to be played.   
---
Glad I'm not going to play a nelf though, yikes.
---
What is real life?
---
Shamans cant use swords in vanilla. Interesting evidence.
---
Sure. But this is a slippery slope.
---
A lot of people see wotlk as the downfall simply for the fact LFD was introduced. It took away the whole RPG feeling, people would just stand in SW or OG and spam dungeons. It took away not only the RPG element to a large extent, but also the community aspect. Interactions werent personal anymore, people were there for you to use. You queue, finish the dungeon, next. You didnt have to look for a group yourself, you didnt have to talk, everything was done on auto pilot to max level.
---
You cannot "judge" weather like that. 
---
Yep
---
Fuck off troll
---
I'm lost. Who said shamans can use swords in the first place?  
---
In fact what are you even talking about?  
---
Nothing in my statement suggested that. I'm not sure what you're trying to get at with your question.  
---
There’s a lot more to it than that. I have to make sure my mama totem is down too.
---
Shaman pvp is easier than the pve chain heal. All I need is frost shock.
---
To be fair, Druids are amazing in vanilla, people just haven't caught up.
---
That said, TBC was superior in most ways.
---
you mean white superiority?
---
Hmm... and what if the ground is green here? Is that racist against orcs?
---
You fat useless sack of yankee dankee doodle shite, fuck off will you please yeh?
---
Well, let me put it this way :
---
I will play TBC if comes with the following :
---
1) 40 men raids, not 25. I want bigger guilds, not smaller.
---
2) no flying. Obviously why I don't want that.
---
3) no arena. This is a MUST for me, because arena created a GAZILLION, ENCLOSED, small groups of 3-5 people, that would REFUSE to raid, took part in guild activity, even TALK in guild chat about anything else except fucking arena. The destruction of WOW community (both PvE and PvP) was started in TBC, with smaller raids (hence smaller guilds), flying and arena.
---
4) NO LEVEL CAP RAISE.
---
5) no effin dailies.
---
6) keep the dungeons  on one difficulty only.
---
7) no badge gear vendors.
---
8) new content areas to be in Azeroth.
---
I could live with new professions, sockets, PvP gear. I could even live with both factions having Paladins and Shamans (even if I absolutely hate this stupid mix). I could live with class changes.
---
Basically, I reject anything that affected the community, and I could accept anything else, as long as it doesn't break the meta to a great extent.
---
Problem is, if ActiBlizz will continue Classic with TBC ( I HIGHLY DOUBT THAT THEY WILL), I will stay in Classic permanently. But, I believe that ActiBlizz will deliver a brand new expansion after Classic, one that will go a very different route than TBC to BfA fiasco.
---
Man it's kinda fucking sad that I can name every zone and FP location there
---
Hopefully they will make another episode for the lunch of classic. That woudk be amazing 
---
Aye
---
Can't wait for that stv lvling.
---
I finished the non-raid materials, but the eye didn't drop. It sucked.  
---
    
---
For the most part I xmuted my own sh\*t and hand farmed what could be farmed solo. The guild was gonna provide me with MC cores and ingots.  
---
Buying your way to 8 ingots, 20 cores, 20 dark iron bars, 50 arcanite bars and 10 blood of the mountain is not cheap.   
---
Some guilds are going to sell off their ingots and stuff, to make money for flask recipes and hard to come by/farm materials for raid consumables, others will just hoard them. I would find a suitable guild whose stance on the matter is the latter.
---
Are you going back to dial up for the authentic experience
---
Who can relate to the scene when cartman is on the toilet reading the  game manual.  I did this  all the time  when i had no clue how to play and spent all my money on the Bkp enforcer gun from the vendor because the name sounds cool.
---
They’re bringing in the Cataclysm loot system into Classic.
---
When a BoP drops it *should* be permanent whoever it gets assigned to. New system let’s it be traded between group members for a few hours.

This system was notoriously abused by small friend groups 2-3 people or guilds. They’d deequip items to make it look like they needed items, all friends would Need roll, and then they’d trade amongst each other afterwards. Your average player had no clue this was happening because they didn’t even know their group mates were friends or on discord together.
---
Also abused by ninjas who would Need roll the final boss item and then try to sell for a crazy high price or they’d just vendor it and leave
---
I'm taking a week off. No kids yet to mess it up

He has no idea wtf he’s talking about
---
Rogues can take fully geared warriors with a skimming dagger in hand because eviscerating deals ability damage
---
The guys swears he did this “up thru Mists of pandaria” do you really think he has any clue how Classic works
---
You didnt do adult life good enough to own your own time. 
---
Lol. BG top damage means nothing in a 1v1. Stay on subject dawg
---
What.the.actual.fuck. Bc had flying mounts so vanilla won. 
---
You started this post saying you could take anyone 1v1 while levelling.
---
Then you switch it to say you swear you top the WSG/AV score screen.
---
COMPLETELY different things - wtf are you going on about?
---
Playing retail made me appreciate classic more cause of how dog shit retail is

I'd be more surprised if there was *not* a WoW mobile game released.  
---
Even before Diablo Immortal was announced, it was old news that Activision planned to push all of it's IPs to mobile.  
---
Whos forsen? Lets hope we are okay in the EU. These streamers have toxic communities
---
WOTLK is where everything went downhill. It's the expansion they started to cater to the masses instead of keeping the game as it was in Vanilla &amp; TBC. Not everyone should have access to everything. WOTLK was the first time since vanilla I took a break due to the game feeling dull after clearing Ulduar.

Hmmm no thanks
---
I also own this book.
---
Got it for £0.50 at a good sale!
---
Yea! Tbc was my shit, change my mind!
---
40 here as well, I'm going to drop the surprise on them at the last minute.  No warnings, no lube, nothin.  
---
Seriously though, I'm just going at it casually, glad with the knowledge that the power creep stops at Nax40.  It will be nice to play and know that everything from UBRS to Nax will still be relevant content and not superceded by the latest tier or expansion.
---
i'd add resillience to that. I know it made "sense" to add it, and a lot of people liked it as well, but personally I just love the burstiness of vanilla PvP, and find TBC "slow and methodical" pvp a lot more boring. 
---
We’ll see if they are number one in classic. Private is not classic.
---
Interesting reading comprehension. Sulfuras is not a sword you silly goose.
---
Im sure those will appear anyway, but really, you don't need a RTX 2080 Ti, a 240Hz panel with Gsync and 32 GB of RAM to play this horrible game. Every midrange system will play this comfortably.
---
If there's 1 thing I'd consider advising people to buy for WoW, it'd be a nice, big IPS screen, since WoW is a colourful game and the UI lets you make use of more space on your screen.
---
Well its not hate or abuse, you need a note, you see a note, you mine a note.
---
Its how the game works. If you want something be smart.

'The biggest problem was getting enough gold for the ingots + bars + dark iron bars .The only thing that my guild provided was lava &amp; fiery cores . Pretty much it took me around 3 weeks of non stop DME jump runs  with over 30 different warriors  / farmed mats there for about 6-8 hrs a day and sold off shards+vendored weapons that were 5g+  and herbs  while keeping the arcane crystals to make bars. Was tough but at some point you get so used to the jump runs themselfs that can practically do them blind or while watching a movie or something. 
---
Going back to 56k
---
&gt; But would you rather risk account security your payment method etc, or just buy it strait from blizzard and not worry about those issues ?
---
That's a very good point and that's why I said it encourages people who'd never buy gold from the black market.
---
Those who do don't care about the risks or they wouldn't do it, they wouldn't exist on retail since the token was introduced yet they do. The token only "helps" those on the fence about it.
---
&gt; Gold is so much more valuable in terms of what type of power it can buy you in game.
---
Absolutely. I also agree the token would affect that but I believe it would be less impactful than people fear.
---
That's because the token doesn't add gold to the economy, it just shifts it between players.
---
To buy gold you have to find people willing to sell it. Given how hard it is to grind gold in classic compared to retail and also more gold sinks in classic on things you actually need, I don't believe there will be many people willing to part from their hard earned income.
---
You can't sell a token for gold if there aren't people buying it. And people buying the token are those who want to pay the sub with gold, it's far easier to grind gold on retail for it, even if you don't like retail.
---
They need to adapt it to todays standards, maybe:

The key is to never eat or drink sugar in front of the computer. Bread, pasta, rice and potatos is like sugar. We humans dont need any sugar or carbs at all actually.
---
you could have saved like ~300$ by just buying the components and building it yourself
---
Is that the soundtrack to that slow rp walk pvp video?
---
IIRC they won an Emmy for it
---
Looks cool! But is there a bit of uncovered map between Ashenvale and Felwood?
---
Ok. So now you spent 600 mana re-entering the form. I would classify that as "work".
---
There will be an addon for that anyways
---
Where are you from? Never heard it called *stone* paper scissors before.
---
This is the key (pun intended) why most groups are 5 man.
---
Yes, if the druid was in range for scare beast he'd probably be attacking you in cat form and you suffer a huge spelldelay which makes the cast go off in like 5 seconds, while the shift for druid is not even a global, and you usually want to be able to use your ranged weapon when you're a hunter (there is still ranged deadzone for hunters in classic)
---
It's really never a good idea to go for Scare Beast because it technically should never work and it's a bad trade. The duel wont last long enough for the manacost to do anything.
---
You play zoomed into first person for full immersion.
---
America is also the greatest country within that continent. That's why they named the continent after it.
---
You dont seem to have done much Vanilla pvp so ill cut you some slack. PvP is very fluid and dynamic. There's plenty opportunity to get in a scare beast if you know what you are doing. As a hunter you have a lot of tools at your disposal to get a cast off. You have pet stun, scatter shot, traps and improved wingclip.
---
The fact of the matter is that Hunters are very difficult to beat as a Druid, and scare beast is just one of the tools in their kit they can use against you. So saying it's never a good idea to use, is just flat out wrong. There are times where you have the opportunity to cast it, and it either successfully land, or makes the Druid spend a whole lot of mana. Either way is a win/win.
---
People act like you got flying day 1 and everyone had it... it didnt kill Wpvp at all. 
---
Alts didnt have flying unless they worked for it too. 
---
40 man raids were tuned for 25 people doing shit and the rest being afk or dead 
---
The daily's actually were cool and unique and the daily island required people to participate to unlock parts of it. 
---
"Separating" high level and low level with a new place didnt change much? How many level 60s did you see in fucking ghostlands that wernt just ganking greys or power leveling crafting ?
---
Til you die
---
You will never ever get a TF unless you are:
---
1. Maintank and/or guildmaster
---
2. primary offtank
---
3. 3rd offtank, 4th offtank etc etc etc
---
4. DPS in a position of power, i.e loot council.
---
At least 50% of the players will be new players

---
no, the continent is Greenland. America is just a country on some tiny island.
---
Yes, and wasting any of these tools just to go for an ability that will be outplayed 100% of the time instead of just getting more distance isn't a good idea.
---
The matchup is fairly equal, and again, Scare Beast is a 10y range cast, can easily get outplayed and basically roots you in place and is susceptible to pushback.
---
We're not talking about the matchup anyway, just the fact that the ability is pretty useless against any decent druid. 
---
I don't know if you did any PvP AS a druid because I'll tell you that using shapeshift isn't that big of a deal unless you're talking low level, and even then it evens out since druids can delete hunters easily in melerange (which is what we're talking about when Scare Beast is actually being used)
---
I mean, go for it and I'm sure you'll catch some people with it because not everyone in this game knows about these mechanics, but it's still a gamble and getting more distance will always be the safer play.
---
Just a stupid Gordon Ramsay quote lol! :D
---
TBC had flying mounts that completely destroyed the travelling through the world aspect. Even if there was no LFG back then, going to the dungeon was nothing but a chore, while in classic you never knew whatever your travel wouldn't be interrupted by world PvP, running into a rare, treasure chest or black lotus. Last but not least when travelling you would always run into people on the server. When reaching the dungeon and waiting for your buddies, you could very well meet someone else doing exact same thing.
---
In TBC had good dungeons and raids but that's about it. Compared to future expansions that I played, TBC was already instance focused losing the feeling of what MMO was supposed to be.
---
They wont. Aq will open in phase 3
---
Vanilla is amazing but TBC brought some things that are amazing additions.
---
Class design is the biggest one, the classes felt more interesting and all talent trees were at least niche viable.
---
Dungeons were also great, I'm not talking about heroics now since they are in general lazy deisgn. I absolutely adore the caverns of time as a concept, and Karazhan is a masterpiece.
---
Professions were also more fleshed out, with more bop items that were amazing in their own rights it felt really satisfying to get that high profession skill.
---
Arena is a bit controversial with the homogenization which I won't deny but the idea behind it was still solid. What the developers then went with it is another discussion.
---
But mostly I agree with you in that the world felt more alive in vanilla and wpvp can't be compared when the world isn't divided with a high level continent and the other stuff not even talking about flying mounts (I still believe flight form for druid was gold in terms of class flavour though).
---
So yes, TBC introduced a lot of questionable stuff but it also remedied a lot of vanilla's questionable stuff. I'd be stoked on vanilla with TBC's class design but I'll take what I can get.
---
why not stupid Osama bin Laden, or Adolf Hitler quote?
---
I don't have any of those memorized.
---
Yeah.

Yes sirree

Hey guys, tips fedora here. Here's another generic video I made to fill the endless content gap before classic comes out.
---
The undeads here don't seem to have will of the forsaken, so go ahead and bring your mages!
---
I remember feeling like such a badass as a mage when I was able to blink and cover distance a bit faster.  Then my heart dropped when I saw hunters and druids blow past me :(
---
disability pension
---
Live to win!
---
yeah, jeez. how could i miss the *alliance shamans* and *horde paladins* issue? also in the name of balance, this change ruined a lot of interesting points of faction pride
---
in addition to just the "new" classes, adding pretty elves to horde and weird noodle aliens to the alliance just made both factions less desirable
---
Came here for that 👍🏻
---
True, tbc did a lot right, but UFOLAND where horde and alliance share a capital never felt right for me. It was the beginning of the end.

I feel like making every spec viable for pvp would kind of hurt the game. I think that the x counters y while z counters x way the game works is pretty solid. 
---
I started playing in TBC however I did play on Nostralius, got to level 58 before it was shut down so I have never got the full classic experience

I have only one.

---
The best way to level up your weapon skills, bar none.
---
There will still be counters. I'm not saying give all specs interupts or silences, homogenizing. Just saying balance all dps specs so that they are similar in damage out put.
---
If someone told you No, would you believe them?  
---
No, you're the only one.
---
I plan on jumping rested xp. Main will be a rogue and my alt will be a warlock. 
---
I'll probably main a Rogue and side-level a Druid or Paladin, as I've never leveled either of those.
---
any number of unneccesasary addons is a bloat  
---
doesn't mean you don't have space  
---
This is what makes the game feels huge and alive. Running all over Azeroth for 1 quest (Water Totem quest amirite?)) isn't optimal but damn it makes you feel like you're part of that world.
---
I will focus on one toon. When I get geared and bored of that one I will lvl a different class. I still don't know which class, faction or even race I want to make. Probably going nelf hunter. Or Horde something lol.
---
Ahh I see. 
---
Vanilla WoW, exactly as it was. 
---
while you wait in login queue lol
---
The gameplay and philosophy of Classic WoW, but taking on a OSRS-style approach to new content, some that was cut early like the Dragon Isles, some that's entirely new landscapes and raids. In an ideal world, this would also be done without creating huge power creep.
---
Vailla wow with some TBC influences: talent trees, hellfire zone, level 70.
---
Thats a big reason why im gonna level 3 characters together to rotate the rested exp so i can maximize my time for effort spent lol. will take a while but it will be worth it in the end.
---
Wauw,   that   was   f#####g   excellent!
---
I'm planning on doing something similar. Rogue main with a hunter alt and eventually a priest/warrior.
---
Will push the rogue quite a bit but probably do the rested exp rotations between the hunter and other alts to play more effectively.
---
Not my content but found it insightful. Do with it what you want. 
---
I would move away from the tank/heal/3dps template, and add more support. Instead of making hybrid damage better, I would make them better at supporting in every single spec.  
---
I would move away from instanced content. I wouldn't remove it entirely. Some instances have their place, but some are superfluous. I would make open world areas in the same vein as BRD, where people can work together to get some decent rewards. (I'm aware there are issues with camping and other things, but I'm assuming they can be balanced out).  
---
I would make better use of weapon skill, and add abilities you can get from them. These abilities will be implemented in a system where using a particular combo of these skills in a well-timed manner, would release a powerful effect that could greatly improve the dps of the group or buff the group for a time. Working together to use these combos should greatly increase the performance of a group, and should be necessary to clear raids.  
---
There are more things I would do, but this is good enough for now.
---
But will it resemble classic at all? What changes will be in it.
---
I don't want Orgrimmar swarming with elves again tyvm
---
Searching the subreddit for what you're about to post is generally considered the norm, even though every other post on here is a circlejerk either how great vanilla was or how bad retail is. Still though, might help to see if what you're about to post has been posted before.
---
I'm going to main a Druid. If I do have an alt it will be a mage leveled primarily through rested aoe grinding.
---
One boomkin for the crit in a group of fire mages. Maybe.
---
It's hilarious that your first statement is the same argument people make about players who want to play Classic. Maybe instead it's just difference preferences, and there is no objective "best" version of the game. 
---
Definitely so. 
---
Its what rich people have done to their dog I think. 
---
Rogues are tons of fun to level, especially as you get into higher levels.  They have so many tricks up their sleeve.  I loved trying to take on groups of 5 or 6 mobs. 
---
None. The beauty about classic was that you didnt need other characters other than your main
---
I’d say most people never played vanilla other than a private server. 
---
Although lots of people will tell you differently. 
---
Germany. There are many terms you can apply. So much, that you can find charts for region specific terms.
---
However, I wanted to emphasize on the entities that have strengths and weaknesses similar to the philosophy behind rpgs, which current wow doesn't meet the requirements to be referred to as such.
---
Rogue/lock/priest 
---
Warcraft has always had tons of steam punk tech, what are you talking about?
---
If we can do both alliance and horde I'll create a shaman
---
America is a continent...
---
I didn't touch naxx and didn't down c'thun but I did my fair share of Vanilla raiding and much preferred BC. 
---
They should never have added flying and more flight points. The game felt more alive with more people on the ground.
---
Bit of an unpopular opinion but i always felt you should need to get a new riding licence and mount for each continent so players would have to walk for a while in each expansion. You would also only see expansion appropriate mounts in each expansion.
---
Word. With an average group I don't even think you would have been able to get through UBRS with 5 men.
---
Especially if you dont b-line it and get into some shit on the way
---
The corrupted blood plauge ended up happening on almost ever server as news spread. Blizz had to shut down and roll back all servers to stop it IIRC. It's not used in real life epidemic and pandemic studies and shit. Single greatest wow moment imo.
---
Youtube "pally reckoning bomb". He one shot Kaz actually. At which point the ability was promptly changed. 
---
Is this a straw man?
---
100% true
---
yes ;D
---
It depends if you want to PvE or PvP, but for PvE Frost is the way to go as the frost debuff profits all mages in the raid, which is why a raid will usually have a few mages that basically help to boost each other's DPS
---
Aye, and conversely, the Furbolg get stronger the further north you travel.
---
We gave our atiesh to our Druid in retail, druids are great late game but weak during mc/bwl.
---
My bad, will do in the future. Posted it from pc and am not so familiar with the site interface. 
---
&gt;Give 
---
with that little time you just should play retail
---
&gt; 3) no arena. This is a MUST for me, because arena created a GAZILLION, ENCLOSED, small groups of 3-5 people, that would REFUSE to raid, took part in guild activity, even TALK in guild chat about anything else except fucking arena. 
---
yeah, how dare other people enjoy different things. they must be stopped and forced to have fun the correct way.
---
This is exactly a straw man. 
---
My biggest worry about classic is not being able to speedrun quests 5 minutes after release.
---
I'm asking mainly for PvE, yes. 
---
It's either Paladin + Hunter on Alliance
---
Or Priest + Warlock on Horde
---
You laugh, until you're mind controlled out of the shadows
---
I don’t need you to help me. I read all of your posts. It’s what happens when people think you’re wrong. It’s called disagreeing. I read all your posts on this thread. I still disagree. 
---
nice, I've found some before but they were really low res
---
thank you
---
im almost certain my main is going to be a warlock and told myself i shouldnt even plan alts now already, but of course that doesnt work. right now im thinking rogue or hunter; that can change at any moment tho.
---
Troll.
---
/thread
---
If you want the extra challenge. Then every time your character sits down to drink/eat, you take a sip of that beer.  
---
Remember to look for a new lever on the AH or get your local blacksmith to repair that chest piece of yours.  
---
Thank you. I just seen somewhere else Undead's racial isn't needed because Shaman totems should be keeping fear off.
---
I also loved TBC, it added a lot of really great content and didn't destroy the vanilla content. Yes the Belf and Dran starting areas where easier but you still got to play the old dungeons and they didn't turn them into agro everything fap fests. 
---
Don't forget every fucking dps speak is spam one button until something glows. What was wrong with curses, auras, totems, shouts etc? 
---
Always the first thing i do. Then go talk to all the NPCs to see if they got something new for my professions. 
---
No, this is Patric.
---
These are the best vanilla wow private server players.  On the most popular pservers right now they run the devilsaur mafia, they engage in cross-faction collusion, so they're pretty much cancer.  
---
This is my biggest gripe as well. Everyone leveling together in Azeroth made the world feel whole and connected. But when you add new continents and new cities specifically for high level players, it makes Azeroth(EK, Kal) feel like the kiddie zone, while the "real" fun is past level 60.
---
You can do that?
---
I can't wait anymore 😭...
---
TBH View distance of players was like 10yards doing this shit and updated super slow also blizzard never said anything about sharding AQ, but this is just a strawman to get upvotes I guess.
---
You spent most of TBC fight the burning legion? Steam punk is part of Warcraft? 
---
As the population on classic was about 6m a lot of people played it. But most likely most of them quit by now both due to real life changing and the game changing. For me it was both but now it is time to dip a toe back in the slow but cosy water Classic was. 
---
Would be rather interesting to have Kara put in as a T2.5 alternative to AQ
---
There is more to the game than world pvp dude 
---
okay mom
---
Sure, but why would you have that version when we all know it's gonna be 1.12 flightpaths
---
Started playing the month bc came out, very excited.
---
Sharding doesn’t “make you on your own adventure” by any stretch. Sharding doesn’t kick in until a zone goes over a fairly large population threshold.  
---
I agree. There nothing wrong with blizzard going: hey let's add a new level 40 dungoen over here or a new T1 40 man over there. More is more. 
---
I just wish we were at the point where we could get mid 00's game design philosophy in a modern game. Since we can't get that, I'll settle for just vanilla wow.
---
Yes with cooldowns.  Need some help from the RNG gods sometimes but it can be done. 
---
Well blizzard now is your chance to make a fun 10 man dungoen there. 
---
More info also means more unneeded info. It's not always a good thing.
---
so you say that wowhead is no longer a legitimate website?
---
sounds interesting
---
Did he update it again? The Ashenvale Nightmare Dragon is there.
---
Removed for our current “What Should I Play Wednesday” thread stickied on the front page. 
---
It was level 20 max yes, but it was also 10 days max. 
---
I'm quite sure they won't shard this. Not worrying about it.
---
Glad to see some newcomers! 
---
Are you having a stroke?
---
Keto nerds. 
---
Keto.
---
Interesting idea. I would like to see it out in somewhere that’s for sure maybe even a 3.5 with resist gear that leads to a new raid located in one of the previously dead Azeroth zones. I think people forget how much time it took to get through Nax, I played daily from launch and our guild barely was past patches. People forget how hard it was to keep a group of 40-50 people motivated and keeping moving forward through raiding progression. It’s not entirely about dungeon difficulties and more about the guild and it how well it’s running. I miss my friends from classic so much, I’d love to talk to them again just to see where they are at in life. 
---
It amazes me to see so many people in this thread claiming boldly that "98% of players won't even set foot in Naxx"
---
You guys seem to know everything about what vanilla was 15 years ago and yet you're completely out of touch with one simple fact
---
It is not 2004 or 2009 anymore
---
Naxx, mc, bwl ain't no new content. Vanilla ain't no new content. 2019 is (very sadly) already era of oversaturated amount of data around and min maxing everything possible. It's no longer random people cluelessly wandering around Azeroth. Even in this sub there's a lot of topics regarding "how to min max x, y"
---
Content will dry out faster
---
To answer question in thread - I would prefer game progressing with expansion content that sticks to vanilla "soul" (no dailes, no lfr, no free epics), but Activision is never going to do this, so I'm fine with reexperiancing vanilla and then leaving when I'm done
---
Here is one of Felwood for reference. [https://imgur.com/a/WDAKexZ](https://imgur.com/a/WDAKexZ)
---
So, when 3 vanilla figureheads (lol) say it's the most erroneous part of Classic's current tentative content schedule you flat out disagree? Can you explain why?
---
I wish you one day find your bank password in clipboard, when spamming that ctrl-v
---
Yeah, let's just assume they're all nothing but a bunch of liars. 
---
Why are you even caring about Classic at all if you've already chosen not to believe anything Blizzard states? 
---
:(
---
Agreed, except for Feral tanks which are equal to warriors in mc cause warriors need the mc gear.
---
or nvm, America is a country on the Mexican continent.
---
no, it's Mexico. And the continent is named after one of the explorers.
---
:clipboard:
---
Figured the title would be “Race to world first 2019”
---
How long did they think deadmines would take lol
---
Agreed, that's why levelling professions is the way to go imo. The added feeling of growing your character is awesome.
---
This episode is what got me into WoW in the first place. Never saw a game that looked so cool in my life. 
---
Probably loot sharing, [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) and sharding zones at launch. They specifically said they won't alter the gameplay.
---
No they are not equal, my guild used a Tauren warrior mt from mc/ony until Kt. Not sure how it is on private servers. You need shield wall for those early raids.
---
&gt;Thanks mom.
---
Didn't they say they were only thinking of sharding for the games launch...?  Why would they shard this.
---
I mean, I took this today. Doesn't look like 10, more like hundreds

If private servers can so can blizzard

If you're talking raids, then IIRC one mage is winter's chill for the debuff and the rest spec arcane for Arcane Power then go down the frost tree.

An excellent resource for mage info is;

---
They used to say a lot things. Like sharding on RP servers etc.
---
Thank you! This will be a lot of help to me!
---
I started in TBC but was young and slow, sharing an account with my brother.  Slow enough that I didn't even hit 70 until after wrath came out.  Still my favorite memory's of the game, but i'm excited to experience classic this time around with friends.
---
Main Priest, maybe alt with warrior or Mage. 
---
Oh yes, I forgot about Quinn.
---
Thanks for the heads up.
---
Give me vanilla wow with tbc talent trees and you have a perfect game. As much as I'm waiting for classic to release I'm also dreading having pretty much one option for tank and heals for 5 Mans.  
---
On live pvp server this event was basically 5-10seconds of lag between abilities at the gong ringing. I wouldn't want it sharded but let's not pretend that it worked as intended in 2005 either... 
---
I just want every spec viable in PvE.
---
I did full frost in MC only getting clear casting for mana reasons + wand damage from arcane. Maybe get arcane Nova crit + arcane thread reduced as fillers for better AoE damage.
---
People are missing what made Vanilla great, and that was the "what's this" factor.  
---
A game with the same core rules of Vanilla.  New, engaging, better gear balance, better class balance.  A new three expansion story arc with a completely new area to play in.  Raids would be 20 man and 40 man but the mechanics would be on par with the new raids.  
---
Who are you to tell people why they like what they like? 
---
The dragon above Moonglade was way worse
---
Doesnt have to be the same. Just has to be fun enough for you to invest your time in. 
---
I highly enjoy your website and the content peope put up there is of the mintest quallity.
---
Just wanted to say great freaking job!
---
As long as original Classic servers stay what they are. 
---
New expansions should only be released with new servers.
---
But doesn't really matter, this is impossible and will never happen anyway. The most we can get is TBC servers and so on.
---
I think you're a dirty ass troll.
---
Nerd
---
I literally ran into a raid of opposite faction before them showing up today so..
---
If you’re a combat build and you use evasion, blade flurry, and adrenaline rush on a stacked pack of non-casters you can kill several mobs at once, but that obviously has a long cool down.
---
I played both and think tbc was the peak of wow.  Vanilla feels like an incomplete game in comparison.
---
He’s being facetious
---
if I did this CPS would be called on the account of child neglect.
---
I quit, but am waiting for the return of classic! 
---
Still torn on warlock or mage for main.  Druid will be alt, not sure if I want to twink it or not.
---
I'm actually just joking and making a reference to everything being hunter gear. I have no hate for any class and love all my hunter bros &lt;3
---
Isnt that what they've been doing?
---
To me, TBC still is the best iteration of WoW.
---
It had its flaws, but those were heavily outweighed by the upsides imho, first and foremost class design and balancing. Also raid design was great and jewelcrafting was a great addition as well to add some more depth. 
---
Would be pretty cool if someone redid this video for WoW classic.
---
thats life. Every time I think somethings gold, it flops and all the shit posts are great. thats fucking life man
---
If you are fast around 1 hour 
---
Id love it. Its possible to see the direction the expansions took and take a different one with vanilla updates to keep it fun and fresh.
---
This sub wont have any of it but i think the general public would be on board.
---
No shift clicking for auction house. You're going to be a better person for typing it out. Wow classic is about growing with your character. Your spelling comprehension will increase the more you practice.
---
when we had large scale combat on top of 8k players in one zone, sure you did.
---
But then again 8k players isn't even close to normal on any actual retail vanilla server, and again, this is group that is financially microscopic next to Blizzard

Back in my day if we were leveling in Un'goro we had to walk there! It was uphill in the swamp, both ways! There were roaming terrors called devilsaurs and no inn either!
---
You kids call that a nightmare, but we just called it low 50s leveling.
---
/oldmanmodeoff
---
Did any of you even play during one of these? You couldnt. The lag was too bad or the servers were crashed.
---
No, the mentioned starter zones as an example, they never said it was limited to those. Knowing how out of touch Blizzard can be with their playerbase, it’s entirely feasible that they shard AQ gates event
---
You’re gonna want to be more careful.
---
The Defias are real, and they’re out there.
---
Same, if activision ruins this only thing idk what I will do
---
&gt; I used to play on private servers too around 2015-2017
---
Clearly useful experience when discussing Vanilla. 
---
Clearly.
---
Anecdotally, I knew an awful lot of people that bought gold in Vanilla. I know 0 that were banned for it. 
---
So youre saying you want the #change of better servers and no lag? Youre a disgrace to the #nochange movement.
---
Ok but now draw arrows of what order to take as race, i.e. night elf
---
They dropped NECESSARY nature resist gear for AQ40, specifically for I believe Vekniss with the poisons. It was a resist check. Our guild called everyone online to grab spawns 
---
Perhaps, but this time around, 14 years later with the advances we've had in hardware, software and internet it wont be as bad.
---
Oh my God I cant wait, I'm requesting a week off when it drops and I'm going to no-life it
---
So for PvE, there are 2 options - Winters Chill build or Arcane Power build. Usually, there will only be 1 winters chill mage in the raid because 1 guy can keep the debuff up for other mages. Arcane power spec lets you do a lot more damage in PvE. Now Arcane Power build is kind of meh for anything else than PvE, you have little survivability, no Ice Barrier, no ice block etc. So when you are fresh 60 I would suggest doing the winters chill build with Ice Barrier and this lets you comfortably do anything in the game (pvp/pve/farming if not aoe). Once you get better gear and want to specialize into something, you can chose the appropriate build. If you had any questions, feel free to ask further :)
---
I mean, in 2005 you had not even a 1/3rd as many people in that zone and nowhere near the amount of combat and calculations that we saw today.
---
Sure after the gong ringing there was but that quickly went away. For all practical purposes, that wouldn't even qualify as a hiccup in my book
---
They fucked you once in retail, you don't worry
---
They might fuck you again in classic, you still don't worry
---
If they fuck you in the TBC re-release, will you worry?
---
Because optimization is so important. It would actually be harder for 2 people to account share and do it. Technically it could be done faster, but the two people would have to coordinate to such a high level that it just wouldn’t be feasible to beat one person playing one character knowing exactly what point they’re at and what’s left to be done.
---
That and in four days you really don’t need very many hours of sleep, so the time advantage of two people working together is slim.
---
Damn, you're obsessed. 
---
Can you chill a bit? Just wait for news.
---
I remember playing on my family's super shitty home pc back in the vanilla days. Had to have all the settings turned down super low so I could play. Who's laughing now?!?! 
---
No. That was pretty common. 
---
If you actually bought bags, and all of your skills, it was pretty hard to have enough gold to buy your first mount. Most people just bought the gold when they hit 40. 
---
love it
---
Oh nice. I decided now that I’ll go for Winter’s Chill.
---
For your last point I do have a question. What builds do you exactly mean when I get better gear?
---
5-10 secs of lag for 10 mins maybe? Back in the day, you'd be lucky your server even stayed up if there was 1000 people in silithus
---
They did "fuck" me recently only in BfA. Legion on the other hand was great. 
---
I've got no reason to assume they're going to "fuck" me in Classic. BfA being bad is no indicator for Classic being bad. 
---
We have quite a few people, myself included, on this sub that played classic. I think its great though that new people are interested because, even though it wont be for everyone, I have no doubt that people will fall in love with the game I fell in love with so many years ago.
---
It wasn't 7k and not nearly close to that many was in the zone, but strawman some more
---
You literally just bitched about a mechanic meant to cope with dense player action, that kept the server online instead of going down, and when I explained that to you, you say I'm a disgrace lmao.
---
Wow, an actual retard. Never met one directly before
---
And it is written
---
I want to see 100 naked gnome corpses spelling out "Welcome to Classic!" on launch day. Sharding will ruin that and people on the same server will have different memories.
---
So let me get this straight, you want them to go out and buy blade servers from 2005 with ram measured in megabytes, or that's too many changes for you.
---
I'll give you credit, that didn't even occur to me. If you think running a modern game on modern hardware constitutes game breaking changes you're actually autistic
---
I played both vanilla and TBC extensively when they were live and prefer BC...
---
&gt; I would keep everything how it was in vanilla but make all specs viable for pvp and pve. 
---
With the way talents work I find it difficult to divide up specs like that. Looking at only the builds that put 31 points in one tree and 20 in an other (ignoring how the talents are distributed in each individual tree) that's still 6 distinct builds per class. I think saying "All specs should be viable for both pvp and pve" forces too much structure on the specs. I'm perfectly fine with one talent tree feeling like more focused towards pvp, or another feeling more focused towards raiding (at least with pure classes like Mage or Hunter). What I'm not a fan of is having those two trees be the same tree.
---
Personally I think that no individual talent should feel like it's never useful. They could either be improved through direct buffs or through synergizing set bonuses and trinkets.
---
The only thing I hope for classic is that the devs literally never visit this sub and completely ignore everything said here.
---
God, seeing pictures like this make me so hyped for classic
---
Having PvP'd a lot, I'd say Druid and Shaman are roughly as good as each other generally but would probably give the healing edge to Druid, if ever so slightly. Lesser healing wave is great due to its short cast time, but Druid's increased speed and survivability along with being able to pre-roll HoT's on players likely takes them over the edge. Druid's also have better ways to escape the fray and get out to focus on healing. 
---
Of course, Shaman obliterate Druid's on the damage end of things, particularly when Shaman start getting +spell damage gear which makes them extremely viable for both damage and healing. I think a lot of people would be very happy to have an elemental shaman beside them for the damage and heal, rather than a Druid whose damage dealing capabilities are far inferior.
---
As for gear, Druid and Shaman are both easy to gear up due to so many drops being only for them. Raids tend to have more Shaman than Druid though so if you are going for tier pieces it might take you a little longer than a druid. That being said, Shaman can wear all the cool healing gear that Druid can, so mixing and matching is usually viable.
---
I'd say the trickier thing for Shaman would be the misc gear like weapons and rings and trinkets. Shaman are competing against literally everyone in the raid for some of these slots, whereas druids are usually only competing against clothies.
---
What does IRL mean? 
---
If I had to guess, I don't think the final numbers will be very different at all from what they were in classic. I think more people will have alts though due to increased leveling and end game efficiency so 3 years down the road a lot of people will have multiple level 60's and hopefully they have fun on all of them.
---
Main shaman resto and alter warlock/mage. 
---
It was at 6k when china was offline 4 hours before the event when most people were sleeping early so they could wake up.
---
I bet you there was at least 7000 people on at the time of the gate opening. When the server launched, there was 13k people, and 5-6k is pretty standard. Retail wow servers were 1500-3000 max on a super popular realm, and they couldn't keep their servers online during the gate opening.
---
I preferred the talents of TBC but the talent tree structure of Vanilla. 51 talent points and trees that are 31 talents deep is a nicer ratio than 61 talent points and trees that are 41 talents deep. In the former a higher percentage of your points can go into a secondary tree.
---
exactly my point. People are bitching about a bad lag spike that lasted 5 mins. with 3 times as many people playing on it. On retail you'd be lucky to log in at all
---
Time is money, friend!
---
For hybrid classes definitely. For pure classes I'm more fine with a spec being worse in PvE, as long as it's still good at something.
---
Hey, I can't argue with that. It's probably best to just stay away from Reddit in general. At least 4Chan has smart people from time to time, this site is basically weaponized stupidity
---
No
---
But I did post a *picture* so therefore I don't fall under your criteria xd
---
We'll see about that. Stormwind is absolutely atrocious on retail. Server-side lag is unbearable. I can't imagine massive server-wide events like AQ working out on ClassicWoW if the infrastructure is the same.
---
Probably, sad fact of the matter is I’m illiterate when it comes to hardware and every time I tried to build one myself I came in over budget. The biggest seller was I was able to finance these through amazon so I have a year to pay them off without interest. 
---
Isnt that pretty much arguing semantics?   
---
Obviously if arena holds meaningful gear and content, then balancing classes is necessary.
---
Having 3 skill trees x 8 classes with different game approaches, breeds imbalance. A warrior would always be at his strongest when obtaining that season's weapon, a mage later on.
---
Had it been a gimmicky leisure time activity like the STV arena, nobody wouldve complained. Balance shouldve been found in 10v10 or 15v15 premade groups. 
---
In these balance in vanilla is actually quite good.
---
Classic community: "yeah pretty much the only thing we don't want is sharding"
---
Blizzard: "Cool. So right off the bat you'll noticed the starting zones are sharded for fluidity...."
---
Do not have high hopes for classic tbh
---
Shaman was my go-to too but the reality hit me. If you have any doubts that you will not be enjoying healing, it will be horrible. I realised it so late, but I hated being stuck as a healer/hybrid
---
This is basically spot on. I was a tribal leatherworker and I was able to fund my raiding simply by pressing the button and farming the mats in the open world myself and throwing a cape on the AH once in a while. Leatherworking isn't a terribly popular profession, but people underestimate how many fabulous patterns it had.
---
That being said, no LW specialization has a lot of terribly flashy end game gear. They make some good progression gear, resist gear, and some good Blues for dps classes that haven't made it into the end game yet, but they really start to pale in comparison to blacksmithing or alchemy or enchanting once you hit Naxx.
---
I did check it out. First started the free leveling retail and noticed retail leveling is total BS. Then I thought that 120 lvl content must be decent and bought BfA, instant 110 and grinded away to 120 while feeling sick about it. Once 120 I noticed how much I hated dungeon finder and my /played at 120 is maybe 45mins after 3 months. All this without saying a word to another player... So thats the retail "mmorpg"
---
I have to pay for a BFA sub which I give zero shits about so that I can play a game that's 15 years old with the graces of the company that made it.
---
Sounds like fucking to me
---
With that I mostly mean switching to Arcane Power so you can unleash your dps potential. Its not really about what you chose you want to be, you generally get assigned by the raid leader who should go WC and who should go AP. WC is inferior for raiding in terms of dps, but needed for boosting other mages up. You can also specialize your build for PvP and for AoE farming. Dont think there are any other builds for different opportunities.
---
Ahh one of my secret delights as a hunter. Pairing with a mage on a journey and slowly catching up to his blink at first, then getting to the point where his blink catches up to me, then, inevitably, insidiously, pulling the stop-and-turn and /wave while I watch him catch up.
---
Whoa bro, are you suggesting we use modern computer technology to run a modern game? What kind of animal are you, sharding is one thing, but using a computer that can do what I want it to do? 
---
That's flat out radical thinking
---
“Well sharding makes the servers more stable you see...” said as live servers crash any time more than 5 people try to world pvp in a single zone
---
You’d think so, but blizzard servers have gone backwards over the years 
---
Imagine downvoting a photo that I took today that clearly shows you're lying by a factor of at least 10 times.
---
Go get some help
---
But wait, there's more!
---
Sooooo epic
---
You're paying a sub that includes 2 games, one of them being previously unavailable to be played legally. You're not entitled to get Classic for free just because it's 15 years old. And you're also not entitled to have a certain state of the game always available to you. That's the case with ALL GAMES that are constantly being developed, not only WoW, not only MMORPGs. 
---
But if you believe you're being fucked then just don't play Classic obviously? Why let yourself get fucked?

This makes me upset
---
it is useful in the context that blizzard is somehow not gonna be able to catch gold buyers and ban them. If private servers could easily catch them and ban them with their extremely limited resources, then blizzard definitely can. 
---
&gt;Anecdotally, I knew an awful lot of people that bought gold in Vanilla. I know 0 that were banned for it.
---
well anecdotally i knew a few people that bought gold in vanilla, and had 1 irl friend that got perma banned for it. 
---
I generally play my main most of the time but I make sure to start an alt. Get it to about level 10. Then log on it every few days. Maybe once a week to maximize rested xp usage. 
---
If there is demand for it toward the end of Classics release cycle then I doubt they wouldnt consider something.
---
The biggest problem lies in how they do it.  If classic must remain classic, then they would have to introduce new servers.  How do you populate them? Porting characters? Copying them? Its unfait to ask people to abandon their classic server if they want new content
---
Just to add to this, I'm currently trying to level a rogue and find it very hard to get invites to instances. The class is over-populated and you have to contest gear with a large proportion of classes.
---
Any kind of original input by blizzard will result in the fundamental change of the game. Which exactly the opposite of what we want. The mentality of the people who originally made WoW just doesn't exist there anymore. 
---
Maybe this isn't the game for you then? Move on.
---
Obviously PvP shouldn't have had gear rewards in the first place. Even some of the days thought it was a mistake when they added the high warlord gear in vanilla.
---
My calves are ready
---
This. 
---
At 1.0 launch you had to do every zone.  1.12 had way more quests and my leveling path assumes you're doing dungeons for superior gear at the appropriate level.  I generally ran WC as Horde or Deadmines as Alliance 2 times.  SFK 2 or 3 times if you're a caster (best robes at level).  And would run Scarlet Monastery from 35-40 as many times as I could since a ton of insanely good gear drops for a lot of classes there.
---
RIGHT? Tanaris is a ton of PVP and that's what i loved!
---
Well. They didn't spell anything but you're close
---

Started in midtbc because the south Park episode and general stigma scared me off. I still played WC3 all the time. Tried TBC and I was blown away just from leveling process. Wish I could have gotten to experience early raids, now I get to with still fresh eyes. Besides naxx of course &amp; zulgurub raptor runs.
---
run to Rut'Theran Village, port to Auberdine, take the boat to Menethil Harbor, then start swimming south by the shore. for a long, long time. when the area changes to Dun Morogh, just drown yourself.
---
welcome to Ironforge! hope you got all the flight points on the way there, otherwise you're not getting out for quite a while.
---
Someone is already doing this
---
[Huzzah](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc2o887oIIrV1j9LZcaEbyg)
---
I believe he's done all the zones up to around level 40, so you might want to collab with him
---
Rogue:
---
1. There are a million rogues per server to compete against
---
2. During raids, you spam the same 2 buttons and that is all you do
---
3. If rogues were entirely replaced in a raid by mages and warriors, not including BWL traps, then the raid would move on with no issues. This may make you feel like you aren’t needed. 
---
4. Rogues can’t use axes in vanilla. Why the fuck not.
---
5. You wear leather which makes you partially squishy.
---
6. You need to always make sure your poison is on your weapon.
---
7.  You can’t sap mobs in combat like mages can sheep.
---
8. No legit AOE
---
9. Blind requires reagents.
---
10. You can’t tank
---
11. You can’t heal
---
12. Rogues are the most nerfed class in the game.   /s if you haven’t seen World of Roguecraft (go watch it)
---
This was hard. Rogue is the best class in the game, there aren’t 12 bad things about it.
---
I was planning on shaman but man, I love rogues.
---
Not exactly, you can still use ground mounts in new expansions, i think it would be better if people walked for a while.
---
If your a caster dps. Getting rockfury bracers is mostly required for hardcore progression as in its bis forever. You need to get reverted with cenarion hold.
---
Once you see all the 60s incoming you can count it as a win and stealth away. Rogue life best life 
---
Also, just plan on never seeing a Sulfuras.  I can't even remember how many times we killed Rag, never saw the eye once. Actually, no one on the Horde on my server got one. I think there might have been one on the alliance side. That shit is super rare.
---
Template?
---
Let's also not pretend that online gaming and consumer level GPUs at the time were anywhere close to adequate to run wow in the first place, let alone with 1000 people with you in the zone.
---
Dial-up was still prominent when I started on wow. Not even DSL which is garbage aways.
---
We're talking 500kbps. 5-10 sec of lag almost describes normal gameplay in 2004. The game was waaay ahead of its time. My computer was choking today, in 2004 you'd be lucky to have 2 gigs of ram. 2 gigs of ram was considered "gaming"
---
I think of ICC as the "dead cat bounce"(trading term) of WOW.  Game was going downhill but ICC brought it up briefly before it tanked down again.
---
from my understanding, it's the way they build servers now. They're completely dependent on sharding. once you start getting a few hundred people around the cloud-based server just chokes
---
They were a bigger stretch, but they at least they weren't contrary to the current standing. I remember using blood elves AS the alliance in WC3.
---
Hmm, maybe i should make a mage. I will be doing alot or there grinds. Its between a mage or a hunter.
---
There a guy who does these in video format and they’re pretty good: https://www.youtube.com/user/huzzahYT
---
Rushing mage to 60.
---
Rotating rested exp on Priest and Rogue.
---
I have seen those, they're good! I do think that a map format is more practical for users however, and it's much easier to tab through a few images to reference where you need to go. Also attaching a readme with /tar macro for the zone is premium
---
I went there by accident with the wrong tp name, it's a really cool looking zone, wish they had added it.
---
This is being brung up a lot, however when AQ gates opened on Bladefist (might been on Outland, most of bladefist migrated during a free migration from Bladefist&gt;Outland, and I am not sure if it was before or after AQ gate opened) but eitherway, the event started around 8am and it still crashed server multiple times and had incredible lagspikes, it was very unplayable. I envy people who could actually play the event somewhat properly because that server for sure couldn't
---
No, I'm saying there's no way to know the source of the survey and it seems unprofessional, so it's doubtful to be something that is at all legitimate/from Blizzard. There's a huge difference between the survey being connected or not with Blizzard and saying Wowhead is or is not legitimate.
---
What do those games have to do with classic?
---
I can't be the only one who took over 2-3 mins to read this because I had to sing it to the original tempo and cadence
---
Thank you for those. I don’t think it invalidates any of his good points, but it is interesting to see where different people believe morals come from. Cheers
---
I find the thrill of being hunted just as exiting as the hunt itself
---
You have to pay a sub to play a sub-based game?
---
I can't seem to find my "shocked" crayon, but believe me it's the color I would use!
---
Did it. Not proud of. Would do it again.
---
Rogue is so appealing for the world PvP potential. I've also always loved the MC and BWL gear they get. Forget what the sets are actually called.
---
Tier 1 (MC) - Nightslayer
---
Tier 2 (BWL) - Bloodfang (best looking set in the game for any class imo)
---
Character transfers.
---
New or altered expansion line.
---
Keep classic ideals and features.
---
i am 100% planning on playing rogue and i was scared that something of that could change my mind. thankfully it could not :D
---
No one is gonna pass that opportunity  up.
---
And that's only after you dinged like lvl 30.
---
same here. its just so hard
---
Retail wow is great for casuals and hardcore players.  If you don't have much time, you can still PVP just fine and steadily collect pve gear while doing your daily stuff.
---
In the states it’s called Rock Paper Scissors which is what they were eluding to, not the balancing methodology.
---
In real life
---
"Totem quest's are going to take you all across the map and take hours upon hours to complete"
---
I have no idea why this is a problem, quests like these is exactly why I love vanilla
---
Think of Warlock a hybrid between a mage and a hunter. It's a very good class with a ton of utility.
---
PvP happened!
---
i would like that, but sadly i cant see any evidence for it.
---
Man if you drink all that Tuborg you begin in Deadmines and end up in Silithus
---
Mage and frost bolt plus roots and your ice barrier make you the ultimate machine. Slow for days and wreck face.
---
also, you do them only once, and its only the water quest that sucks, the others are ez
---
And free water! Better than the hunter tho?
---
Not sure about launch day, but I plan to get a mage alongside my warlock and level him for a bit (but most likely not to high level, just to experience old Westfall and Redridge again).
---
Maybe even paladin if they make RP servers.
---
flying mounts killed world pvp? Did you forget things like the daily pvp quest in hellfire and all the pvp to control thec3 towers? Or the halaa place in the middle of nagrand
---
With todays knowledge of gearing MC is a joke and better with a feral. I'm in no way saying they're better for AQ/Naxx.
---
It's a competing MMO. 
---
Need it too, huge potential
---
People calling "strawman" really need to realize how much better modern tech is relative to back in the day.
---
You dont seem to understand the fact that russian neckbeard's can manage to provide a stable 100+ event (with increased realm caps). 
---
Are you seriously suggesting a multi-BILLION dollar company cannot deliver that?
---
Just because the only experience youve seen is retail WoW's singleplayer minded servers that crash with 10+ players in the zone, doesnt mean that its hard to accomplish.
---
Ffs just look at resistance on PS3!!! so many more players on A FREE SERVICE.
---
Stop accepting "oh they cant afford, its impossible" when its shown infront of you. Fuck sake.
---
I'm not entitled to playing a game just because they stopped supporting service for it? That's like saying you aren't entitled to use that old laptop you have running Windows Vista because Microsoft no longer supports that software. You most definitely are entitled because you OWN it. Just because they add some shit on to the game doesn't mean I'm not entitled to play the game I bought originally.
---
now does that mean I shouldn't expect support or enterprise-level support and development for that product anymore? Absolutely. 
---
I don't want a sub that includes 2 games. If I go buy GTAV, the fact they threw in Hello Kitty Island Adventure means absolutely nothing. It's really simple, I bought the game, if you no longer support it then let third parties act in your stead. I can't believe this argument that I'm being done a favor for "getting 2 games" and paying the full retail price and development costs for BFA (because vanilla is largely complete) when I am in no way interested in BFA.
---
It's not a favor, LH showed today they can do their job better and at no cost to you every month
---
Mc is easy but the first few times with no epics it can be annoying, warriors are still the better option due to shield wall. 
---
My warrior:
---
1. The most unforgiving leveling experience of all the classes.
---
2. The most helpless class in solo world pvp prior to being insanely geared.
---
3. The most gear dependant class.
---
4. The most popular class and thus the highest competition for group spots.
---
5. The most popular class and thus the longest grind to acquire gear.
---
6. Most expensive preBIS by FAR.
---
7. No support capabilities.
---
8. Unforgiving repair costs.
---
9. Poor solo farming capability.
---
10. Most socially dependant class. Great with others, weak alone.
---
11. Slow starters. In terms of the life cycle of the server, if you aren't a ranker, warriors don't really take off until you're decked in bwl gear. I'm reaching here, but this is tough.
---
12. Warrior t2.5 pvp gear (what most people will be wearing endgame except the hardcore) makes you look like a total clownshoes. And all your other loot outside of tier gear makes you look like a colorblind maniac.
---
That aside, warriors reward the patient so very much, and if you stay the course you'll be a god from aq 40 onward. Cheers!
---
I was already planning it. The day before and while installing. Theres a website that lets you watch episodes of shows together with a chat, i say we have a group viewing.
---
Well if classic comes out maybe they'll try some events every so often to make sure playing the same expansion doesn't get stale like they fear.
---
Whether they could do that without ruining it or not is the question.
---
They give us a lot of bullshit answers. The real answer is smaller servers and server virtualization technology allow them to save money....
---
You say that, but once you're getting your water totem you'll be cursing it like the rest of us. 
---
i swear something about the slightly slower pace of combat in vanilla actually gets my blood pumping in pvp. In retail it doesn't happen, but in classic if I'm in a little battle with someone it actually triggers small amounts of adrenaline and I can feel my hands shaking and shit, its really weird. It used to happen back when vanilla and tbc were live as well. Something changed somewhere.
---
If i remember right the offhand weapon speed only matters for rogue poisons. They wanted faster speeds to apply poisons more often.
---
With warriors you just want your highest base damage weapon in your main hand, and simply the highest dps weapon in your off hand (or your second highest dps weapon incase your main hand weapon is both higher in base damage and dps than your other weapons).
---
Same but I've been taking a brake from wow and only playing diablo 2 XD
---
I understand trying to minimize lag, but there is something to be said for huge crowded areas. The world is big enough to accommodate everyone. I legit used to go grind in Desolace to avoid crowded areas, but that’s not what I always wanted to do. Since WoD every zone has felt like Desolace, and I’m not a fan. 
---
I’m sure technology has advanced enough to get a much better experience with AQ, without sharding. It may still be laggy but it will be way better than the original opening. 
---
what a brainlet of an argument holy shit  
---
LOL. What the fuck are you talking about? I play it more than you. I played it today, or can you also not read?
---
Oh you mean Blizzard demanding $15/mo to reskin, and "revamp" a 15 year old game we play for free already? Yeah probably not. Vanilla is definitely my jam though. Classic, not so much
---
You must be a classic player, not a vanilla one
---
OMG yasss. This is gonna help me alot
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TR7FC-h0Fb8
---
Exactly what I thought. Get your main, you won't see him until he wants you to. 
---
I'm just keeping a healthy skepticism.
---
Blizzard's promised a lot of things in the history of WoW that haven't come to pass.
---
"Happy star congrats" or something like that
---
Probably used this https://imgflip.com/memetemplate/Happy-Star-Congratulations
---
Same. Maybe it's because every auto matters or something. When you have a game like Diablo or something where there are just explosions and particles flying everywhere it's almost too much to process
---
Break it down man. I'm dying to hear this argument for paying $180 for a game that came out the same year San Andreas did
---
Pservers can handle AQ launches with 8-10k players online and a few thousands in Silithus. If Blizz fails where pservers managed to do it I’m going to be hella disappointed. 
---
The same problems persist. That's not a viable solution.
---
*ambush
---
When you run all the way to TM for the well, grab the flight path, hearth to org, and forget to fill the satchel after all that running. 
---
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF-
---
wow great content!! Never thought about BS as anythign useful but he really highlights the quirkiness and things I didn't really know about the prof. Neat guide, thanks for sharing
---
Fun to do if they’re on/near level with you. It’s more fun to toy with low level characters than kill them. Sap them. Use some ominous emotes like /mourn or /laugh. Gouge, run away, restealth. Watch the absolute panic as they wait for their death that never comes. Maybe throw a distract or two in there. 
---
 hey guys, I've just uploaded a video on why I think loot trading might be something we have to get used to... I'm definitely not in favour of it, but from what John Staats writes about in The WoW Diary, it looks like the economics of classic might force Blizzard's hand!
---
And I take it this was somewhat recently? More proof that this should just be left to third parties to handle. If blizzard can't find a way to have a world event without crashing their servers they don't deserve any authority on this matter.
---
The event was more or less flawless, no crashes, very little lag. So was the launch, and that was 13,000 people. Not even exaggerating 
---
me
---
I did that quest couple months ago on a private server, I liked it tbh. It felt like I am actually on a quest.
---
Are you going to roll warrior again on official servers? 
---
No worries. Just let the pros handle it. They also charge $0 a month
---
This is untrue for classic. DW warriors want fast off hands in order to generate rage (and secondly crits, for frenzy). Faster is better for fury off hand, and even mainhand a quick weaponspeed can be very good if you are able to generate enough rage since you just spam heroic strike.
---
Oh yeah! Running away and hiding from a swarm of 60's after the dirty deed is a lot of fun. I liked doing this at the entrance to UC. It was easy to hide by jumping in the sewer/moat or whatever that was, they never followed me in there. Then just wait like 5 min and do it again. 
---
Wow what do you know? ND currently has 8,100 online and this is well after the event. I'll actually double down and say it was 9000 at gate opening
---
AoE grind &gt; all, so yes, mages are easily#1
---
This thread have triggered me.
---
&gt;During raids, you spam the same 2 buttons and that is all you do
---
Is this actually true? Because I am torn between Warlock, Mage and Rogue and the deciding factor is the raid rotation. I know that warlocks and mages have a 1 button "rotation" but I thought Rogues had like 3 or 4 buttons to press in a fight?
---
&gt; ferals as much as rogues etc.
---
Ok but why would you ever bring a rogue to a raid in your game?
---
My favourite place is by revel camp in stv. I love wall climbing up the hills and watching them search for me. And I'll admit to getting a kick out of seeing other players of my faction get murdered for my crimes...
---
Great song, better ending lol.
---
you paid for it back then  
---
you pay for it now  
---
doesn't matter what year it came out  
---
waow that sure was tough to comprehend  
---
Blizz devs today are not gamers themselves so I have no faith in them.
---
More details needed. Is this for leveling or at level 60? Gear or no gear? Mage can AoE grind but it’s almost certainly unrealistic for Classic for quite a while with expected population. Hunter can have little to no downtime while leveling if played correctly, is better equipped to deal with PvP, and in general they’re much faster. You also get to 60 a lot faster so if it’s for the sake of gold Hunter has already acquired X gold before Mage even hits 60. 
---
&gt; You most definitely are entitled because you OWN it.
---
No you don't. You seem to have absolutely no idea how purchasing software works. Do some reading. 
---
Whatever, I can only repeat: if you believe you're being screwed then don't play Classic. r/wowservers has got you covered.
---
These were stabled to every piece of homework when I was in 3rd grade if you got an A lol
---
Got this as a reward for passing 5th grade n moving into middle school lol
---
You talk about they're #1 expenditure being customer service, and I didn't finish your video but skipped around- do you appropriate attribute this to the mass quantity of selling, trading, and scamming (mainly this) back in the day? Accounts were being flipped left and right, many, many times each. Each time someone sold or traded their account it was just a 20 minute phone call away from being theirs again, or at later times, they'd have to send in a scan of I.D. I can only assume this was the most massive sink of any singular cause for customer service back in the day.
---
This has been my observation too, there’s this one guy in particular who says, “tbc was the best expansion” (he means version seeing how vannilla wasn’t an expansion) but he never even made it to 60 in Vanilla.
---
I’d like to see a survey of people who played Vanilla while it was live and other expansions that takes factors like how far they made it into Vanilla (end game wise) and other expansions and see which they prefer, but I’m a bit skeptical about getting honest answers.
---
I don't give a specific reason why it was the most costly part, though I make a couple of suggestions. John doesn't mention why it is in his book, but I would say it's just because of the large amount of staff that CS requires - people are not cheap to employ!!
---
&gt; th the advances we've had in hardware, software
---
BuT mUh SpElL bAtChInG
---
So radical it might... just... work...
---
He has instant cast shots and longer range and can also feign death if it's a bad pull etc
---
How would you feel about a voting system similar to OSRS to make decisions about new content?
---
Still, Nak wasn't wrong
---
I forgot about being rage capped and spamming heroic strike, but isnt rage generation adjusted for weapon speed? And faster weaker crits is the same as slower stronger crits, which is what i mean by adjusted for weapon speed. 
---
His whipped nature reminds me of Jefferson D'Arcy: [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BUdY\_\_4CYAA97w-.jpg](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BUdY__4CYAA97w-.jpg)
---
... if we're talking Classic then '90s sitcoms are fair game.
---
it was 7k at opening
---
That's actually fair.  Seems like the primary behavior on pvp servers for rogues though is to:
---
1) Level to 40+
---
2) Head for a mid 20s pvp enabled zone and start wasting people who stand zero chance against you
---
Dooba doobaa doo scatman
---
Yes but you will still get more from a faster weapon due to more crits and your misses being less detrimental. Either way I know for sure a faster off hand is BiS
---
I believe so. :)
---
"Its a pvp server bro."
---
-Rogues who only engage in unfair fights.
---
My main was a rogue, so if I got camped on one of my alts I would jump on it and get them by surprise, typically while banking others.
---
They do. I’m not sure about mages, but it’s far more involved than pressing shadow bolt over and over. Basically you have three primary buttons: your CP builder (Sinister Strike or Backstab); Slice and Dice; and Eviscerate. The idea is that you have to keep SnD up at all times, and use spare CP on Eviscerate. 
---
You also have to line up your trinkets and racials with Adrenaline Rush to get the most dps, but make sure not to draw aggro when you do this, so you might want to vanish just prior. It’s really not that brain dead as far as Classic rotations go, though it’s nothing compared to many later rotations.
---
lol okay. So I buy an xbox game, what you're saying is since it's software they can prevent me from playing the game I bought at any time by simply making an "expansion". Basically, Rockstar or other developers have the authority to:
---
* reclaim their copy when they feel like you should no longer be allowed to play it
---
* force payment for the maintenance and development of a modern game in order to regain access to an altered version of the original game that you didn't play in the first place.
---
I'd like to see that argument in court. As long as you personally aren't monetizing their IP, and only using it as a consumer (ie creating infrastructure that facilitates the use of that unsupported software, etc), there's no legal basis for holding a consumer hostage with their own videogame
---
Druid:
---
1. Your bear form isn’t as good as being a warrior
---
2. Your cat form isn’t as good as being a rogue
---
3.  Your healing isn’t as good as a priest
---
4. Your moonkin form isn’t as good as being a mage or warlock
---
5. You’re garbage at farming.
---
6. People won’t take you as the sole healer in 5 mans.
---
7. You have to pay for stupid reagents.
---
8. Your free teleport puts you in the middle of fucking nowhere.
---
9. It takes forever to get your 100% mount.
---
10. It takes forever for people to take you seriously in PvP.
---
11. People won’t even try to kill you in world PvP because they know you will just run.
---
12. Everyone just wants to see you bear dance.
---
This Character is going to be made for various grinds, 1-60 while doing ALL quests available, Frostsabre, reputations etc. 
---
True
---
This is some nice shit. :p
---
u seem to be mad. dont get mad at videogames tho m8
---
As I said, do some reading. You're still not getting how buying software works and keep making up ridiculous strawmen. 
---
Simply put: you're only purchasing a license to access the respective software in its current retail state. Whoever provides the software has the right to alter it as he sees fit or even shut it down. 
---
&gt; I'd like to see that argument in court.
---
So sue Blizzard for free Classic? Go on. The case is obvious according to you. 
---
😆 
---
Just did an AQ gate opening with 10k online and it didn't lag, didn't crash once... 2005 was bad but we don't need sharding
---
Nothing feels quite as good as ambush hitting an enemy who just sat down to drink, with a brand new blue dagger you just bought at the AH, dropping them with one fat yellow crit.
---
It’s like crack straight to your veins
---
Yes, they are with out any sense of irony suggesting that and when you talk... certain 'servers' you get censored. We've all (mostly) seen the various videos of 100+ people fighting in the same zone on these certain 'servers', multiple times, on youtube. Despite this they'll pretend this is a strawman and that a multi-billion dollar company can't afford it.
---
It's honestly depressing that russians in the backend of europe can do this but the people that actually invented the game can't. Even modern servers run like bunk, any more than 30 people in the same zone and everything falls to pieces. Hell, they even shard RP servers and they promised that would never happen. Let's not touch on spell batching or how the recent Blizzcon went. Take it from a former long time player, expect the worst. We aren't going to get classic like they promised and as soon as they can they'll change as much as they possibly can to appease bored retail players, make it in to a playground for them, while they wait to be milked by the next xpac.
---
But where would it end? Once TBC has been running for 2 years, do you want WotLK? And once WotLK has been going for 2 years, do you want MoP? Do you want to end up in BfA? If so, why not just play BfA right now?
---
That’s boring. The best rogue fights are enemies close to your level. You NEED the advantage as rogue from opening from stealth or you lose most fights so you have to pick unfair fights in that sense, but some classes always put up a good fight i.e. mages
---
Maining a orc shaman or dwarf priest based on what my friend rolls Alli or horde.   
---
Feral druid alt with gf, helping her experience the game for first time. Although I am thinking someone that's able to res more often with her lol.  
---
Maybe I'll do feral solo and play priest with her.  
---
Either way doing 3 toons, my always favorites, priest, druid and shaman.  
---
I like to buff and support, could never be a pure damage dealer.
---
Yeah, I’m cool with that. 
---
Probably
---
As is tradition. 
---
I can understand ambushing someone low hp after or even during a fight what I can not figure out is taking your high level rogue and camping lowbies for any extended amount of time. Is killing 20s with you 50+ fun to you? I just don't get it.
---
You actually have no idea how stealth levels work
---
I was there for launch. There weren’t any major issues outside of not knowing what the fuck I was doing 
---
I haaaaaaaated leveling rogues. But being able to do this would make it worth it. Except I’d be the idiot they would help the lowbies not gank them. 
---
while its very likely to have all questhubs and fp from the beginning, until they finalize the content release schedule they can still cut content which came later, even stuff like maraudon
---
I would highly doubtful blizzard cares at all about any other MMO. Seeing as the one they plan on releasing is the greatest mmo of all time. 
---
Paladin:
---
1. Unless you're holy everyone will hate you
---
That's kind of it :/ 
---
Pretty much this. No arena, no flying, better dungeons in Outland and KARAZAHAN
---
THIS IS PRIVATE SERVER! REEEEEEEEEEEEE!
---
Why would a low level rogue stick around when they see 60's coming? That's exactly what his post was about. You count it as a win and leave the area. Sure if you stick around that zone and that guy is dead-set on finding you he might. Once a smart low level rogue sees people logging off and max levels showing up he knows it's time to leave.
---
Have you checked out pantheon? Seems to get a bad rap on here for whatever reason but I certainly stoked for it. Maybe still 2 years til release but will give time for me to flesh out classic
---
I did some reading. In America, you need to show that you were harmed in some way. The case I believe you're referring to Blizzard won on a default judgment (no defendant). But the owner was profiting off of given donations, and therefore that's IP theft.
---
If, however, an admin does not profit and only facilitates the use of that software, they would have to show harm. In the case of wow, pservers have no effect on revenue for modern games (because we won't buy them anyways) and in some cases is a net benefit overall to blizzard (keeps old players playing their games). So while you may have some argument, you also open yourself up to a countersuit because the defendant could claim harm from restriction of rights, and may have a case for having a net positive effect through their actions and claim compensation for unwillful compliancy. You also run into a mountain of other legal issues by forcing customers to pay for the development of a completely unrelated game in order to use the software you bought 15 years ago.
---
In practice, it never goes to court because it's not illegal. In my case, I don't have to sue blizzard for anything, I already play free vanilla. Had they continued support, they may have a case for subscription fees but they don't. 
---
As far as the ELUA goes, they can only take action on things they control (ie your [battle.net](https://battle.net) account). Unless you are profiting from their IP, they have no legal argument for damages. You bought the game, you play the game
---
#onlychangeacceptable - character creation screen option to make my character a lefty.
---
Fellow lefties unite?
---
For 4. Sap only lasts 10 seconds in pvp (same as polymorph) so that's somewhat unlikely 
---
Mage:
---
1. Having to make food/water for people.
---
2. Painful to drink after every 2-3 mobs while leveling.
---
3. That's about it.
---
tldr; If they think there is money in it anything would be possible. But anything other than going to tbc is more unlikely.
---
 If you add content without raising the level cap, over time you'll only be catering to a smaller and smaller group of people. Because there are two ways to do that, adding more tiers of raids/dungeons/zones or adding alternative content like daily quests or gimik activities like a warfront. The latter are in BFA and suck and won't add longevity unless there is a way for players to progress. The former will slowly make it less and less likely any new people or even alts start. If you have a tier 10 with lv 60 than those hard core players will be literal gods compared to a fresh 60. If you add catch ups, then you are effectively removing all the original zones from the game. 
---
If you increase the level cap and do an alternate expansion path then you are destroying 12 years of lore, and putting the responsibility of making it "in the spirit of classic" into the hands of blizzvison who did such a bang up job of it the first time. And since that would be new, why would they not try and make it more modern? There really is no possible version of 2.0 made in the 2020s that can be in the spirit of classic. Also this way has much more existential risk to wow. If they devote significant resources to a new patch 2.0 they are effectively giving up on current expansions and classic at the same time. One bad expansion after that point will probably be the last one. 
---
I would be but idk about going to back to 2k graphics :/
---
&gt;the general public
---
Yea, the dumb masses, let's count on *them* to know what's good for direction and balance.
---
I joined in Cata and bought the battle chest which iirc came with a prima guide? And I would read that literally everywhere, at home, at school, on the toilet... Literally me lol
---
Those dragon sculptures are badass, wish I had a better view of them 
---
Fantastic idea really 👍
---
Perhaps they’ll change their entire intended approach months before launch because someone used a lot of caps on a reddit post. 
---
What a terrible statement.  There was no auction house in Outlands; Kara, Hyjal, Caverns of Time  - all on Kalimdor.
---
That's Frank, he likes Sudoku puzzles and playing MTG
---
Unless their actions are clearly IP theft blizzard ain't gonna do shit, because trying to make the stupid arguments I've laid out in could completely backfire on you.
---
Next thing you know you're in a circuit court and they say your arguments and EULA is complete bullshit, and instead, you need to pay everyone who bought your game their money back for restricting their rights and privileges implied by purchasing the game
---
Yup. The leveling is the hard part, and it's honestly not *that* hard. The unforgiving part is that everyone but rogues and other warriors have their way with you, and it's rough. 
---
Nice math, didn't know
---
I think I am going to roll a warrior as well.  It was my first class in Vanilla but I never got to 60.  
---
It looks like Azuregos. Don't ask me how I still remember that.
---
Priest:
---
1. No other class can fuck with others nearly as much.
---
2. Hostile players are playthings. Mind control them, fear them, run them into enemy mobs.
---
3. You have the answer to damn near every situation.
---
4. It's easier to find groups as a healer.
---
5. You're hard to gank while leveling if you know what you're doing, since you're always high on mana.
---
6. Ridiculously varied playstyle.
---
7. Each one of your specs are viable.
---
8. Dispel makes buffed up enemies cry.
---
9. You're not just another meatbag in organized pvp - you easily act as a multiplier to the strength of your team.
---
10. Shadowform is kinda cool.
---
11. I can't repeat this enough times: you are a fucking wrecking ball in pvp, making your enemies life miserable.
---
12. You can make mobs do the dirty work for you with mind control.
---
+1 Trolls are the sexiest race and this is the class they absolutely shine in.
---
Hopefully the devs decide to make progression based servers and non-progression. That way the base can choose where to play
---
Reeeeeeeeee, #nochanges.
---
But seriously I'd be down for this. Problem is the butthurt crew wouldn't. 
---
If you want a true classic experience then the opening of the aw gates needs to be an unplayable shitshow, that's how it was then, thats how it should be again. #nochanges 
---
Don't forget to sap him a few times after he rezzes. Don't kill him, just annoy him until he logs out.
---
Much more fun than gaining no honor and making him walk back to corpse. At least then you get into the mind games with the terrified playet
---
I don't need to refer to a a specific case at all, because I know how software purchases work. You don't even need to have deep legal knowledge for that. 
---
You. Don't. Own. The. Software. 
---
The only thing you get to own is your license to access the software. The software however may be altered as the developers see fit. You have no right for it to always stay the same, none at all. 
---
&gt; In my case, I don't have to sue blizzard for anything, I already play free vanilla.
---
And even if all pirate servers were gone and you could not play vanilla for free anymore, you'd still not be entitled to it. You'd fail spectacularly in court. 
---
&gt; You also run into a mountain of other legal issues by forcing customers to pay for the development of a completely unrelated game in order to use the software you bought 15 years ago.
---
No, you don't. You know companies like Activision Blizzard have legal departments, right? But suuurely they're just all banking on no one actually suing them. And suuurely they're willing to offer OBVIOUSLY ILLEGAL (according to you) practices and risk taking heavy losses in lawsuits just because they're sure nobody will sue them. 
---
It is azuregos I was just trying to be funny in the title.
---
People like you are why wow is dogshit today. 
---
I played hardcore in retail vanilla and would read the wow forums back then. Most of the changes that happened and ruined the game are from old forum threads demanding change. Player base should never be listened to except for extreme scenarios.
---
Vanilla and TBC was the best times, even on my feral druid tank main. Really got to shine in TBC.
---
I never really found warrior that hard if you make sure to do everything you can to make it no so painful. Properly kiting, itemizing yourself, being time efficient and having FA up to date. A leveling buddy helps as well
---
Nah bruh. You just need a target for your rage. I don't need lfg, lfr, flying mounts, loot sharing, etc. But the content of vanilla is limited, eventually it will end. What then? 
---
&gt; Next thing you know you're in a circuit court and they say your arguments and EULA is complete bullshit, and instead, you need to pay everyone who bought your game their money back for restricting their rights and privileges implied by purchasing the game
---
Oh boy, you seriously believe that bullshit? 
---
Ridiculous.
---
Only a main tank would want a fast main-hand to spam heroic strikes on certain bosses. If they can't get rage capped, a slow mainhand is better.
---
For Furies, it depends. The highest dps weapon is the only real concern, but there can be benefits and drawbacks to fast/slow. Fast generates a little more rage and frenzy stacks via more chances to crit - but it also depletes frenzy stacks more quickly.
---
The BiS weapons for a Fury Warr a good while is Ironfoe + Felstrike (an epic dagger from Rend Blackhand in UBRS), but good luck farming for both.
---
Which private server are you playing? I’m assuming rogue will be popular to start because everyone wants to take advantage of world PvP. I’ll prolly roll priest to troll gankers and be useful 
---
God I miss these old songs.
---
Every time I've tuned into this guy streaming private server launches, he always seemed to look like Sam Hyde.
---
It's real simple: I bought your game with the understanding I can play your game when I want to. You then remove my ability to do so. If I find an option that allows me to continue to exercise my rights to use my game, that doesn't infringe on your right to profit from IP, then I am absolutely allowed to do so. Not only am I allowed, but I've now suffered from your decision to abandon our mutual agreement (breach of contract)
---
Yeah that's a tough one dude, because I've never bought BFA so I haven't in the past or now or in the future consented to paying for it. 
---
Buying Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans in 1994 doesn't mean you agree to pay for their 2019 relaunch of the same game.
---
I think you're confused. I bought vanilla, and therefore I am legally entitled to play vanilla unless it causes monetary loss to the licensor. At no point did I ever consent to paying for classic. Those are two completely separate games.
---
Yeah, ganking lowbies was pretty fun from time to time actually!
---
Dunno, I played one character in 2 years of retail vanilla, raided from mc to kt and was never bored. Didn’t roll anything else, classic will give me time to roll more than 1. New content will radically change the game and having servers dedicated to new content will split the players. 
---
The only real option is to leave vanilla alone and release tbc and wotlk eventually.
---
I would definitely suggest hunter. Mage's AOE is simply overrated. Yes it's awesome and quick but only under the right circumstances. You need to be alone and you cant just AoE everything. Hunter comes out on top in terms of consistency while doing grinds in the open world.
---
Or Blizz just sends a C&amp;D and these things never even make it to court because it's clearly IP theft.
---
Hi, /u/InfiniteTaisuru
---
But then it's not vanilla. 
---
Warrior:
---
1. God mode in end game gear.
---
2. Easy to gear up in dungeons because you can tank and tailor groups to avoid competition.
---
3. Sick looking pvp gear.
---
4. High skill cap in duels.
---
5. Mortal strike crits feel borderline sexual.
---
6. Only plate class hordeside.
---
7. Tauren warriors are sick.
---
8. Bonereaver's Edge with windfury (my personal dream.)
---
9. Most empowered pvp class with dedicated support by a mile.
---
10. Only end game viable tank (yeah, yeah, a few rare exceptions, but for the most part, warrior is your one stop shop.)
---
11. Strongest cleave damage.
---
12. Sexy.
---
Going to be so fucking pissed if they do any sharding past starter zones - and I’m still not even happy about that. Please don’t do this blizzard. Me and most of my friends are pretty hard core on no changes and will not play if classic has sharding.  Doesn’t matter to me at all, nothing to lose, I just hope blizzard is smarter than this. 
---
Vanilla balance should not be tampered with. How is that not vanilla? Tbc and wotlk pale in comparison to vanilla but that won’t affect classic servers to much.
---
Hi, /u/Vinticore
---
Hunter:
---
You will not get a spot in a pug raid that you need any gear for.
---
You need to be better than all the other hunters at dps to prove you're worthy of a raid spot.
---
You'll do no damage anyway.
---
1 less bag.
---
Warrs and rogues will take all non tier bis gear from you.
---
Deadzone will make a mockery of you in pvp.
---
Pet food.
---
You get nothing of value from AQ40.
---
In Naxx guilds won't want to take more than two hunters.
---
The demon quest is the best quest ever, if you're a masochist.
---
The two best pets are camped constantly and need to be leveled from under level 40 all the way to 60.
---
If you ever miss a tranq shot or mess up a kite, it'll be your fault the raid just wiped.
---
Thanks for your input, kinda confirms my opinion. Also with engineering there is no ammo costs!
---
So you come up with the genius idea to revamp the game I originally bought, and expect me to pay for not only it, but a completely different expansion, to justify a high subscription cost.
---
But there is most definitely a legal argument that I have always had that right, but you refused to facilitate it. When the game was modern, you could justify that sub fee, but since the IP is 15 years old and nothing has changed for the most part, a case could be made that I'm now being double billed for rights I've already purchased.
---
I hope for blizz's sake no lawyers played vanilla cause there's quite a few questionable things to be resolved
---
Absolutely. The #nochanges community are the ones responsible for classic as far as I'm concerned and I would NOT support any new content unless there were servers set aside that were exclusive to old content only so that people, particularly the #nochanges community, didn't have to play the new content if they didn't want to.

What an absolute mad man. Poggers indeed.
---
I mained a druid in vanilla and my spouse mained a hunter. Plan to do the same again. I like to tank so we didn't have to worry about waiting ages for a tank for a dungeon. As an added benefit we both have non-mount speed increases to run around faster. Especially before level 40 or whenever you save enough for a mount.

what is clearly IP theft? Playing a game you bought?
---
Shiiit. Lock everyone up then they dun played their games
---
I had a good laugh when I realized the azsharite in Azshara was mountain giant poop.
---
It's shit but I think the choice is reduce CS costs to classic to the levels of retain or find another way to monetise classic. It shouldn't be how it is, but it is. 
---
How do we get blizzard to see that the investment in CS is worth it for the integrity of the game? Screeching at them about systems we don't like won't do it - I had the idea of community customer service taking the place of paid CS like it was back in the day, I would gladly do a few hours of community CS a week to solve these kind of issues rather than have loot trading implemented.
---
I mean, I get it. A quick glance at retail WoW shows how far the game has "fallen" and why there's a distrust from Blizz's end to actually implement quality content to the game; and I'm not meaning to throw shade at people who play retail or retail itself, but the games are night and day as far as game design/play goes and that's why I want Classic back. 
---
I'm really interested to see how the "butthurt crew" reacts to the game in the long term. Sure, people can say "we've been playing Classic for decades and people are still playing," ok sure, on servers that don't have a monthly sub fee, on servers that may/have gotten shut down or their economies ruined so people jump ship to a new one. We don't really know how a stable, long term Classic server is going to play out for the player base and I'm personally interested to see how that goes and where Classic lands after X amount of time. 
---
because blizz doesn't know what their audience wants anymore.
---
Thanks to sharding, there's no way you'll end up finding him when you switch to your main.
---
Holy Paladin is generally considered the best raid healer in vanilla. They have great mana efficiency and very beneficial buffs for the raid. Be warned that prot and ret are both generally considered to be pretty bad so you will almost exclusively be healing.  But if that’s your thing, you’ll be great at it. 
---
I can’t speak to shame as I mainly played alliance. 
---
See the problem with court is that nobody knows for sure what the court will rule. You seem to think there's no question here that playing a game you bought is illegal. A judge may completely disagree with you and order reparations. Which is why there isn't any real examples of it. If they did raise a legal argument, it could be settled against them. But with classic, they've actually opened themselves up to a potential lawsuit
---
&gt; This doesn't really answer your question though.
---
Not directly, but I appreciate your input because you did make me think that my SO might like to play a hunter. She loves our dogs and would probably tame a wolf and name it after one of ours lol. 
---
I'm gonna rock me a belt druid and I can't wait:)
---
This is correct. Best damage all around is sticking 2H to grab all the damage and exit talents. Then once you got 40 you can switch arms for MS
---
To release tbc and wotlk is not vanilla. Fairly simple deduction. 
---
It's been awhile since I've played hunter, but
---
1) Not sure what that's about.
---
2) You have to regularly feed your pet their preferred diet, or yes, I think they run.
---
3) Pets need to use certain skills to pull aggro.
---
Literally, have live footage of russian neckbeards "doing the impossible" players and spells as far as the eye can see on a 15 yo client and not crashing.
---
incredible
---
You have to do some stranglethorn probably. I only have alliance experience, but the quests in Shimmering Flats are doable on the level 35+ side of things. At that level, I like doing RFK and Gnomeregan at least once for the quests. You could also do some of the Alterac Mountains quests. They're somewhere in the 30-40 level range, and Dustwallow Marsh also has some quests that could help.
---
They used server blades in 2004 they use virtual servers now most likely owned by Jeff Bezos.
---
But seriously though, WoW most likely exists in an Amazon data center
---
Yeah, I don't mind getting camped/ganked a bit. However, when there is no chance for me to turn the tables (level 20 me vs level 50+ them) it just gets annoying because I'm at their mercy. One thing back in the day I liked to do to kill time was go exploring in the spirit world. Locations wouldn't pop up on my map but I could get an idea of where everything is before a quest sent me there. 
---
So your logic is to add new content and to radically change clsssic servers? 
---
I won’t be playing tbc and wotlk servers, all I want is classic. You are the one arguing for changes to classic.
---
&gt;  New content will radically change the game and having servers dedicated to new content will split the players
---
On a long enough timeline though the playerbase is going to dwindle to the point where you're going to struggle to do content because there's not enough people (or there are but they're not people you want to play with) online to do said content, so it's going to be different oceans to the same shore anyway. 
---
&gt;The only real option is to leave vanilla alone and release tbc and wotlk eventually.
---
Wouldn't that too split the player base? Let alone, that doesn't solve the problem of finite content. You release TBC, ok that's cool for another 2 years, but then what, Wrath, ok well that's good for about another 2 years. More than 2 years, I know, but my point remains that regardless, without completely new content for the game, there will be a content wall if you go with TBC or Wrath or whatever. The only theoretical way to avoid that wall, is new content. 
---
Every class in MC and BWL  gets very routine. Especially dps. It is still a blast no matter what. 
---
Rogue main as well. Havent made up my mind if i want a hunter or mage alt. Maybe ill just make both 
---
As a former classic undead  player I never knew the struggle was THIS bad. And I thought being on a different continent was bad enough XD
---
oh dude nobody is mad at videogames; we're mad at stupid people
---
Shadow bolt is warlock. One Warlock also debuffs curse of elements. Mages have only one spell for damage in the rotation as long as the raid molten core / bwl due to resistance. Fire has a bigger reaction / rotation
---
None wil shard this. They clearly said that they will use it only in the first zones at launch or shortly after. No point in this thread:)
---
&gt;It's real simple: I bought your game with the understanding I can play your game when I want to. You then remove my ability to do so  
---
1. You always had to sub. So you could never play when you wanted to  
---
2. They never removed your ability to play it  
---
&gt;If I find an option that allows me to continue to exercise my rights to use my game, that doesn't infringe on your right to profit from IP, then I am absolutely allowed to do so 
---
1. not "your" game. You have a copy of a game and you have to purchase account time in order to play it  
---
2. Any other way of trying to play the game may break the law depending on where you are  
---
&gt;Not only am I allowed, but I've now suffered from your decision to abandon our mutual agreement (breach of contract)  
---
They didn't abandon anything nor did you "suffer" anything since nothing was abandoned.  
---
&gt;Buying Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans in 1994 doesn't mean you agree to pay for their 2019 relaunch of the same game.
---
​1. Classic WoW is not the same game as World of Warcraft version 1.x  
---
2. You actually don't have to buy WoW again so your argument falls flat. You have to get game time like you always did  
---
&gt;I think you're confused. I bought vanilla, and therefore I am legally entitled to play vanilla unless it causes monetary loss to the licensor  
---
False. You bought World of Warcraft and you have to have subscription active in order to play.  
---
&gt;At no point did I ever consent to paying for classic  
---
Good thing you don't have to pay for it. Just the game time.  
---
&gt;Those are two completely separate games.  
---
Exactly. So even if they decided to make it so you have to buy it again, you wouldn't have grounds to argue about it.  
---
You seem incredibly confused my friend. You have zero understanding of what you're talking about.  
---
Just have the boys re-roll
---
you should really get your habit of replying multiple times to the same comment sorted out  
---
&gt;So you come up with the genius idea to revamp the game I originally bought, and expect me to pay for not only it, but a completely different expansion, to justify a high subscription cost.
---
​No? You don't have to have BFA to play Classic. Who told you that?  
---
Me and my buddy spent our entire vanilla career playing warlock and resto Druid. Works very well together. Great survivability and CC. 
---
There was never an autoloot addon in classic as far as I was aware. You could make the loot window open under your mouse, but never apply the shift modifier. 
---
undead have it kinda easy in this regard, you can just take the zeppelin to orgrimmar. night elves... now that's something else.
---
This is brilliant.  Genuinely makes me want to focus on raiding now and getting to Naxx!
---
Well, I disagree.
---
Have a great evening.
---
You hate STV? Do you even classic bro? 
---
At the end of the day, you’re comparing a private server modified to handle a 10k population (in which the AQ gate opening was pushed up by 5+ days for some reason, making many people not be able to attend due to having made plans for their weekend before the annoucent on Thur/fri) to the how it was in vanilla where the servers were capped at 3k and everyone and their mother wanted to see the opening due to it having never been seen before. Like, where in your screenshot are all the people who just wanted to go and watch the opening? Oh wait, there are none, BC it’s a p.server where majority of the people there either trying to go raid, or there to try and kill raiders of the opposite faction trying to enter.
---
It’s simply not a good comparison. 
---
Additionally, you have this hard on to believe that blizzard is actively trying to lie to the classic base regarding sharding. You’re just arguing with everyone telling them to not believe a word blizz says.
---
Salt flats- really good exp/hr and visibility.
---
I liked tanaris and furbolg grinding too
---
Just finished the work on the first version on the launcher :) 
---
Link: [https://ibb.co/bRg5qgW](https://ibb.co/bRg5qgW) (Yes the launch sound is also there)
---
Currently rewriting the launcher using a new framework (old version generates a 100+ mb executable, currently sitting at a \~5mb executable using a new framework).
---
The tool is written in HTML+JS and is cross platform (not that it's needed but he). I will be putting it up on GitHub for everyone to see / help / download.
---
Is anyone knows a good community driven forum which i can pull the news messages from (for the launcher), please let me know.
---
Also looking for people who would like to test the launcher - it can be used with your retail wow installation.
---
Just hoping blizz won't get upset because i'm using their assets haha
---
Have a nice day all!
---
Buy your arrows and keep count. 
---
Don’t let your pet run away unhappy. 
---
One reason why I'm focusing on a human frost mage for that increased perception. 
---
“Don’t make me get my main” sign of any true pleb
---
&gt; The unforgiving part is that everyone but rogues and other warriors have their way with you, and it's rough.
---
I never leveled a warrior before, I'm leveling one right now on LH, Im basically an NPC to other players but instead of droping loot I drop honor points. It's tough.
---
No Doritos? No Mountain Dew red and blue? 
---
Newb.
---
I started in BC at the end.  By the time I hit max level, Wrath was out.  What inspired me to go for max was the cool tier sets from BC.
---
To this day, I think they have some of the best armor sets of all time.
---
Really nice guide. It really hits all of the points. I’d basically crossed blacksmithing off my list, but you are right, the game doesn’t need to be about min-maxing. 
---
It does look incredibly expensive though. It would be amazing to be one of the first on the server to be able to craft lionheart, but due to the fact it will be dropping in a 40 man situation I probably won’t get it even if it drops. 
---
I guess if I can become the official guild armorsmith for instance, it may be possible. 
---

rewind to 2006, lagging on boat, not able to see anything at all. not even NPCs...
---
thats why?
---
the worst is this non-content gets upvotes. 
---
inb4 but private servers...  
---
Metrics and data reveal if something is required for server stability. Not "feelings and dreams" of Ideologues.
---
Blizzard will do what they must if crashing and performance becomes an issue. Nobody here knows the limits of the engine they are using. It isn't as robust as many believe which is why sharding is required normally with it.
---
Blizzard is emulating Classic ... no duplicating it. "No Changes" is a myth. Classic will be nothing but about change. 1.12 client and class mechanics, no class and balance updates like before, and only content progression all on an entirely different engine than old classic and all private emulators. Any future development will be cased on this current meta as well ... not historical.
---
Change is what we are getting on top of everyone's delusions of what was versus what is. We are just quibbling over what is staying mostly the same during a very brief snapshot of how the game played over it's duration.
---
I remember playing a good part of Vanilla with 4megs of ram. Going into Ironforge was a struggle.
---
I know what servers they used in 2004, I have one sitting on the bookshelf in my living room. My point is vanilla wow did t run smoothly, at launch the servers crashed, there were rollbacks and restarts mid raid. There were game breaking exploits and loot bugs that weren't fixed for months. 
---
Having 10k people in the same place smoothly never ever ever happening in classic so I don't miss or have any opinion about something I never experienced. #nochanges 
---
1) Try calling your pet. If you die,  your pet doesn't automatically die. If your pet dies, you need to revive it. Anything other than being revived/called, is bugged. Never seen those issues in vanilla back in the day. There were some bugs via stabling, however.
---
2) When it's happy. Keep your pet happy / fed / alive. No reason to have anything other than a happy pet- it deals increased damage when happy.
---
3) Aggro is a lot harder to keep in classic period. Make sure growl is on auto cast, and don't use your instant DPS right off the bat. Lead with serpent and a few auto's until pet gets 2nd growl off. You actually want to pull aggro when mob is at about 30-20% health so that your pet doesn't take any more damage and the mob dies before getting to you (via kiting).
---
1. Use the call pet ability and your pet's corpse will show up. Then you can revive it.
---
2. Running away is only possible if you starve your pet while it is at the lowest loyalty level (Rebellious), so you don't have to worry about it at all later on.
---
3. Make sure your pet is set to automatically Growl when it is available. Every 10 levels you should return to your class trainer and talk to the nearby pet trainer to train the next rank of growl. Then go into beast training in your spell book to teach the new growl to your pet. Also you will need to periodically tame new pets to learn new ranks of pet abilities to teach your main pet. Other than that you may just need to wait a second for your pet to get some threat. BM spec is highly recommended for leveling.
---
Depends on how OK you are with grinding. Grinding isn't *that* less efficient than questing, depending on your class. Not advised, but you can find some good spots outside of STV if you don't mind the grind. But no, there is no zone that will carry you as much as STV quests.
---
A true rogue right here 
---
Wait, I just realized, ha ha, Greenland is a country on the continent of America!
---
Mage: 
---
1. Food + water for 40 man + fandoms
---
2. Portals for everyone missing materials / rep (greetings to WL getting the guy back to raid
---
3. Buying buff material
---
4. One button rotation trough MC and BWL
---
5. Sheep is breaking every time it will wipe your group
---
6. You have to share gear with WL, priest, other mages ofc and even healing druids + paladin sometimes. This can easily be 3 or 4 man in a 5 man group including you
---
7. You have nearly no life. Warrior charge + MS might instant kill you
---
8. No cool quest line like for class abilities, mount or benediction
---
9. When you pull with sheep (and are a tick faster than the warrior shot) the enemies will focus you down in about 1/4 of a second
---
10. No solo bosses as they are slow immune (except you go instant cast only with no damage), even then no self-healing
---
Used to run it as a 20man dungeon before player caps were introduced.
---
What site?
---
I have a feeling they will revisit this makes too much sense
---
Can someone do a paladin one 
---
i didnt forget about those objectives, but the playerbase did.
---
they were essentially abandoned after the first two weeks of BC
---
there was way more world pvp at throne of elements than the actual "designated world pvp locations" (which shouldn't be a thing imo -- world pvp should be organic)
---
The best advice I can give anyone looking to obtain either item is to start your own guild. Otherwise I highly doubt you are getting either. 
---
TF is much more important and is BIS for all of Vanilla. It will go to the main tank. 
---
The second one usually goes to the main OT, but I’ve personally experienced it going to a rogue. I was the OT, but the rogue was the co-guild leader. This was our first TF, our MT and other Co-guild leader wasn’t there when the binding dropped. If I got TF it meant I’d likely become the MT and replace our GM... guild leadership wasn’t having it so they gave it to the rogue. Long story short I was salty af, ended up quitting the guild a month later. Couldn’t get over it. 
---
Sulfuras, while amazing for a Warrior often goes to a Paladin or Shaman. This is because it’s really more of a PVP weapon. A DPS Warrior is either DWing or Using BRE in most cases. So it’s not really helping the guild by giving it to a Warrior. 
---
The most important thing in getting these items is politics. Be the GM, or at the very least be an officer. You’ll have to be well liked. This doesn’t work for TF, but if you really want Sulfuras, show that. Become a Master Hammersmith, craft or have all of the mats for the base “Sulfuron Hammer” prior to the eye ever dropping. That should get you preference once it does. At the very least it will get the conversation rolling. 
---
Last but not least... be lucky. These items are rare AF. 
---
I mean isn’t it something like one level = one yard for detection?  So even if you were ganking and you were level 20 (which is a really low level to be ganking people) and a level 60 came, they can see you at 40 yards or basically the same range as a maximum marks hunter range for attacking.  
---
You will see the level 60 way before they will see you so just walk away.  
---
Pretty sure sap last longer then 10 seconds. I know for a fact Sheep last over 10 seconds in PvP in vanilla.
---
Having the second person fill in for only the hours the first person is asleep would be best for optimal real time results, but what's likely the more important factor is that everyone tends to measure the time to hit 60 in /played time regardless. Might be part of the culture of speedleveling wow that people want to do it solo.
---
I agree. I love his videos, but for actual use a map format is better. 
---
Perhaps you two can collaborate? 
---
STV is just too good to pass up. It has a huge level range so you won't spend that entire time there. You do some quests, leave, then come back later. The only thing about STV that is frustrating are the graveyard locations.
---
One less bag is one less bag.
---
As for pet food, it's more that you need to keep enough food at hand for pet deaths on top of general health restoring purposes. Might not be much, but in some situations it's certainly notable.
---
I remember being a blacksmith as a warrior and it was expensive and hard to get good plans and make any profit. I probably will not do that this time around, I’d rather just pay someone to craft me an arcanite reaper 
---
U can very effectively farm DM:E as druid in pretty much any spec with shit gear.
---
You hit the instance reset cap and can farm easily 50g per hour without trying at all.
---
One thing I’m really interested in that I can’t find is a list of Rares that drop BOE Blues. Back in the day I used to farm the Gnoll in Redridge that drops a rare dagger and a naga in Azshara that drops a rare sword. I was able to make some good money doing that. 
---
More or less I want to know the ones that are a really worth killing and looking for. 
---
Reducing respec costs? No.  
---
Increase buff duration? Already in the game, but it uses reagents.
---
Yeah my first 60 was a Warrior master sword smith. It was basically worthless to make money unless I was putting on Spurs. I never had Sageblade or anything like that. 
---
The problem is almost none of these craft ables are BIS for any class. Lionheart and Titanic leggings are great obviously,  it beyond that it’s a crap shoot. 
---
feelsbadman
---
Some people just want that feeling of holding power over others. You're probably too healthy to really get it
---
Warrior is a tough slog. That being said, if people are on the fence, it’s actually really easy to level a warrior when you roll it as your second character. My brother and I (who were garbage at warrior) managed to get our warrior to level 60 quickly because we were both feeding him gold and items from our mains.
---
Warriors are extremely gear dependant for leveling which is obviously a bad thing in general. But if you’re extremely gear dependant and you get great gear, you can really roll through certain enemies, especially if they are low armour.
---
Yeah it takes so much time farming ore and then you need additional rare items which usually you put out of pocket. I don’t remember turning much profit reselling items I crafted. I’m thinking I may do alechemy as a paladin, I love having extra consumables to deploy whenever neeeded
---
I'd be down to collab with anyone- I would gladly make all the maps + markers and names for each rare spawn. I could add in level but not sure that's necessary, and adds more clutter. I'd also make the /target macro's in one large PDF so players can ctrl+f the zone, ex. "Azshara" and then copy past the /tar chain for Azshara mobs into an easy macro.
---
What I'd rather not do is filter through each rare mob's pages of loot and make a separate page annotating their specific drops / rare's with higher blue % etc. though this would be excellent knowledge
---
Sometimes I like to afk without quitting. Will my pet starve and run away?
---
No, if you give blizzard an inch they'll take a mile. 
---
They sell a blue Mountain Dew now it’s actually my favorite flavor it’s probably similar to this, and they have code red. I actually still have two cans of this laying around somewhere I think...
---
That’s what stood out to me too.
---
It will work itself out, because they will all reroll at 60 when their damage levels out and the find out they wont be using cat form in Molten Core.
---
Maybe in very early vanilla but from 1.2 onwards it was reduced further and further until it was capped at 10 seconds.
---
Classic will be based on 1.12, where it's been normalised and diminishing returns are established
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Sap
---
I'd support certain qol changes, but not respec cost as that is gameplay effecting 50g too much for a casual? Too bad pick a spec that will work or everything, the game has been ruined catering for casuals, as havesh said paladin buffs are already longer with reagents, I would support things like a keyring as all that does is save some bag space 
---
hahahahah no fucking way man

&gt;Tier 1 (MC) - Boobslayer  
---
FTFY
---
Hi Memoryspark, would you be willing to talk about it on camera. 
---
Hmm, probably classic WoW with TBC influences. I liked the class balancing more then than in classic as more specs were viable and pvp was pretty fun. Maybe it could have some tbc zones but likely no flying as that doesn’t fit with vanilla. 
---
I’d also like to see how it would work out if Night Elfs were part of the Horde at first with High/Blood elfs on the Alliance side from the start. Maybe with undead as a middle faction that aren’t playable but you still encounter them, could be interesting.
---
I have one can of horde and one can of night elf (unopened) pm me if you are interested lol
---
You need to grind as you quest. Kill all the mobs to, durning, and from your quest location. Make the most out of your questing zones.
---
restore my post you fascist troll
---
Ive been a healer for 5 mans and know many other druids who can heal 5 mans. The only problem is 1 rez every 30mins
---
Alliance: No blessing of might for you (only melee AP).
---
Horde: Any melee in your group and they will get WF totem, no agi totem for you
---
Everybody in your group will love aspect of the pack to come back after a wipe but as soon as you remove it 1 sec too late, people will scream at you
---
Your pet will be a pain to manage on many boss fights, this coupled with your own skill rotation to do perfectly to avoid lowering your dps even more...
---
Even when reaching an amount of agility where survival spec can output more than precision spec, your guild will ask you to keep precision and buff melees with your aura.
---
To get Thorium arrows, you will have to exchange thorium bullet stacks, one by one
---
Nothing to add, in spite of all of this, hunter is a very good class, I have so much fun playing it in dungeons, pretty sure I'll level one sooner or later!
---
Do you not find the rationalwiki links a little concerning? I don't think he's a nazi or anything (some people go waaaaay to far) but he is sort of indoctrinating vulnerable young teens with reactionary ideas that aren't really grounded in facts (or at least, in the modern scientific literature)
---
Have to like calculate the drop above them so you can get 2 GCD’s off without them outranging you lol. Then have time for the third, probably engineering parachute or maybe you’re really fucking lucky with noggenfoggers
---
Hi TheKrafty
---
That's quite a story would you be willing to talk about it on camera possibly?
---
The bottom line is that the game I have was legally attained, so using said game is not copyright infringement. All additional language deals solely with my service with Blizzard, and is not legally enforceable. Since it says that Blizzard can cancel service at any time for any reason or no reason and without warning anyways, who cares. 
---
If by entitled, you mean I possess a valid license then yes I am entitled. I have not distributed my client nor stolen it.
---
I have followed all stipulations as to my use of the game. I have acted in good faith and not used it for commercial purposes. You could argue Blizzard can cancel their service with me, but again, who cares? Bottom line is nobody is gonna get sued for playing on a server unless they're doing something else. and it sure as hell will never be someone with a physical copy. A case could be made for torrent distributed clients but it's not worth enforcing
---
And if they're lucky enough to find someone that fits that description, they likely live in a country that doesn't give a single fuck about copyright laws.
---
This is a moot argument. It's just interesting
---
I was level 49 when TBC dropped.
---
I look forward to hitting 60 when it mattered and wasn't just something that happened while I was leveling through Hellfire Peninsula a month after everyone else.
---
Man I’ve played wow since beta and for some reason on two 60’s I never leveled in STV. I feel like I really missed out. 
---
Use group finder to list a custom group with auto-accept. Join group with alt. Ta-da, same shard
---
 1: Judgement is your only way to directly affect combat for most of the game.  
---
 2: Seals last 30 seconds, and disappear when you use judgement.  
---
 3: Blessings last 5 minutes until you get greater blessings at level 60 that last 15 minutes, but require reagents.  
---
 4: The specs are a mess. There's only one real viable endgame spec (holy).  
---
 5: During leveling barely anyone wants to group with you because you can't tank, heal, or do damage as well as any other dps class.  
---
 6: A lot of the best preRaid gear is cloth or leather.  
---
 7: All other classes will hate you for needing on their stuff unless it's int plate gear.  
---
 8: Exorcism and Holy Wrath require you to be fighting undead to be at their best.  
---
 9: at level 60 barely anyone wants to take you to dungeons, even as dps, unless you've proven yourself to them in the past.
---
10: Raid buffing...  
---
Hi Huskyturtle would you and you guild be willing to talk about it on camera?
---
Would you roll paladin?
---
but Frost Shock OP! 
---
Mage
---
1) Top tier dps for all tiers of raiding.
---
2) fire spec is amazingly fun for 5 mans if your tank can hold aggro from ignite
---
3) best cc in the game. Rank 1 blizzard spam /w frostbite talent will randomly frost nova people. Polymorph is op.
---
4)mage T2 set is one of the most fun builds in the game. You spec into imp arcane missiles and spam the ability until you get a free pyroblast.
---
5) rotation is easy, so dps is consistent.
---
6) best pve farming in the entire game, kill 50-60 mobs at once with blizzard spam. And feel like a god doing it.
---
7) really high skill cap in Pvp, giving you the player room to improve. I’ve been playing mage for 7 years and I still find things to improve.
---
8) good dueling ability and world Pvp. Kill any class that fails to one shot you in melle.
---
9)bloodvine set
---
10) make gold by /afk in city and making water or portals every now and then.
---
11)portals. So as horde you can set ur hearth near the city in blasted lands for brd access.
---
12) pyroblast.
---
wow so you were chased by spreaders of the infection and camping out. Would you be willing to talk about it on camera.
---
I'm just saying that you don't want changes yet you ask for tbc and wotlk. Which is a change. 
---
so you have a very different side to the story, would you be willing to talk about it on camera with me?
---
What exactly are we "giving" them? Permission to alter their own game?
---
thats awesome so you were ground zero almost when it hit, would you be okay to talk about it on camera.
---
Not a chance once your raise its loyalty level
---
If TBC drops, I'll literally tear my adulthood card and sink balls deep in it like it's '07.
---
Yes, it's one of the 3 classes I want to play in Classic. I played a paladin for most of Vanilla.
---
Warlock:
---
1. You need 40 extra shards to summon all  lazy guildies multiple times during each raid.  
---
2.  You need 40 extra shards to summon all  lazy guildies multiple times during each raid.  
---
3.You need 40 extra shards to summon all  lazy guildies multiple times during each raid.  
---
4. You need 40 extra shards to summon all  lazy guildies multiple times during each raid.  
---
5. You need 40 extra shards to summon all  lazy guildies multiple times during each raid.  
---
6.  You need 40 extra shards to summon all  lazy guildies multiple times during each raid.  
---
7. You need 40 extra shards to summon all  lazy guildies multiple times during each raid.  
---
8. You need 40 extra shards to summon all  lazy guildies multiple times during each raid.  
---
9. You need 40 extra shards to summon all  lazy guildies multiple times during each raid.  
---
10. You need 40 extra shards to summon all  lazy guildies multiple times during each raid.  
---
11. You need 40 extra shards to summon all  lazy guildies multiple times during each raid.  
---
12. Sorry couldn't think of any other reason, we are that good  :P 
---
Nice I was a warrior but I want to play hybrid, I always liked the human paladin look and I can still dress like a warrior if I want
---
Respec cost reduction is a pretty big change economically..
---
Did you even read my post?
---
These are QoL changes I would support:  
---
Items show what they vendor for in tooltip.
---
When mousing over an item you can press a button to reveal the tooltip of your equipped item in the same slot. Maybe an interface option to enable it by default.
---
For hunter I wouldn't take tailoring. That's more useful on clothies. Enchanting can be a good profession late game, but it's a gamble whether you'll get those rare drop recipes or not. Same can be said about alchemy flasks. On a fresh serve I would advise dual gathering profs to start. The best combo I think would be skinning+mining and herb+Alchemy. 
---
Definitlier slowlier
---
You realize the reason people want classic is they don't like how blizzard has altered the game right? 
---
Certainly
---
Playing a paladin is an acquired taste. Most of your leveling will consist of: Bless yourself, use seal, auto attack mob. Occationally use judgement and reup seal, but only if absolutely necessary (to conserve mana).
---
Azuregos is a nice fella, after doing the AQ40 quest line and learning more about him I don't want to kill him anymore. 
---
My first encounter with Taerar:
---
Lvl 30ish shamz is on the way from STV to ally lands. 
---
Getting to Duskwood with no significant effort.
---
Wandering around, seeing the path in the mountains and undiscovered map space.
---
Getting inside that hollow.
---
My potato computer loads the surrounding.
---
A hune horrendous drake is running towards me. WHAT THE ACTUAL...
---
Rezzing at spirit healer, hearth back to Grom Gol to never explore the ally lands up to lvl 60.
---
Druid
---
1. You can play any role
---
2. You can stealth by lvl 20
---
3. Fun class quest
---
4. Bear dance.
---
5 . 30-39 god twinks with travel form
---
6. Able to get out of Wpvp
---
7. Able to heal or tank regardless of spec if you have 2nd set of gear.
---
8. Innervate and brez are game changes in dire times
---
9. Not much competition for class specific gear
---
10. Easy leveling
---
11. Aqua form making you the fastest in water 
---
12. Flag carry mvp
---
that can't be true. 4 megs?  that is 1994 PC specs.   WOW  was 2004. 
---
deep end game raiding current content in both?
---
Sure, I just think its hilarious that you think we are capable of "giving" blizzard anything other than supporting or not supporting their product.
---
If you know you are going afk just dismiss it (hunter ability). It will lose a bit of loyalty but it’s better than coming back and not having a pet. They should theoretically only leave you if they are a newly tamed pet with low loyalty or you are not feeding it as often as you should. In vanilla a newly tamed pet will require a ton of food to “keep happy” (compared to later wow expansions). But eventually, your pets loyalty will increase and you will not have to feed it as often. Also, the chances of leaving will diminish dramatically. Good rule of thumb is to always keep your pets happiness maxed (green smiley face). Also cooking/fishing is very helpful in keeping a ton of food and bigger bags to store said food. Good luck!
---
 Yes,  they are with out any sense of irony suggesting that. All I can think  of is the meme image with the neckbeard eating a plate of shit and  asking Blizzard for seconds. When you talk about... certain 'servers'  you get censored. We've all (mostly) seen the various videos of 100+  people fighting in the same zone on these 'servers', multiple times, on  youtube. Despite this they'll pretend this is a strawman and that a  multi-billion dollar company can't afford it. It's EMBARRASSING.
---
It's  honestly depressing that russians and eastern europeons from much  poorer countries in the back end of europe can do this but the people  that actually invented the game can't. Even modern servers run like  bunk, any more than 30 people in the same zone and everything falls to  pieces. (If they don't get a GM to intervene) During a literal xpac  revolving around PVP. They even shard RP servers and they promised that  would never happen. Let's not touch on spell batching or how the recent  Blizzcon went.
---
Take it from a former  long time player, expect the worst. We aren't going to get classic like  they promised and as soon as they can they'll change as much as they  possibly can to appease bored retail players and fill it with  microtransactions, make it in to a playground for them, while they wait  to be milked by the next xpac.
---
Ah shit fuck me, forgot tanaris. You’re right mate, no clue how that one flew over my head.
---
S a rogue I can think of waaaay more than 1 reason not to play a paladin 😁
---
&gt;You always had to sub. So you could never play when you wanted to  
---
&gt;They never removed your ability to play it
---
Nowhere in the EULA or ToS I agreed to does it mention I must pay a monthly fee to play the game. To access Blizzard's SERVICES, sure.
---
&gt;not "your" game. You have a copy of a game and you have to purchase account time in order to play it  
---
&gt;Any other way of trying to play the game may break the law depending on where you are
---
Yes I have a license, but I do not need to pay money every month to maintain it. Otherwise everytime you unsubbed, you would have to uninstall it.
---
Again, the EULA isn't the "law". The only "law" we may discuss here is copyright, which I have not violated. I legally purchased the game and did not distribute it, data mine it, etc.
---
&gt; ​1. Classic WoW is not the same game as World of Warcraft version 1.x  
---
2. You actually don't have to buy WoW again so your argument falls flat. You have to get game time like you always did 
---
Yes, that's what I said thank you for repeating yourself. Vanilla =/= TBC =/= Wrath. You must be new, you used to buy expansions. 
---
&gt;  False. You bought World of Warcraft and you have to have subscription active in order to play. 
---
True. I did buy world of Warcraft. To access Blizzard's services, yes I do need to pay a subscription.
---
However, I am not using or interested in their services.
---
Their EULA has changed, however, I agreed to the EULA on the disk and in the client.
---
My main point here is that unless you're committing copyright infringement nobody cares. And most of the time nobody cares anyway. If you are profiting from such activities you likely live in a country where, again, nobody cares.
---
But like South Park said, "you can always sue somebody".
---
I don’t think you understand. I want classic to stay exactly as it is for the next thousand years. Tbc and wotlk would be separate servers, not taking classic servers and putting in tbc.
---
My personal best option would be to release classic, never touch it or add anything and no expansion servers ever.
---
Again, you are the one that wants to change classic by adding new shit.
---
It's a phrase, dude. It just means to not make compromises. 
---
yep exactly. people who prefer bc, aside from one or two outliers, didn’t play vanilla end game content when it was current. they may have leveled up, but they didn’t really experience vanilla fully. Leveling was fun but it was just the tip of the iceberg of the game. 
---
I was about to post the same.  As a teenager I worked half a year to purchase my first good pc, a 486 DX2 66mhz. It cost  €1300 (  €2000 in todays money)   And another €250 for a Soundblaster card.  My second PC a few years  later would cost around the same.   My current game PC  cost €200.  (discontinued office PC plus a  second hand graphics card) 
---
I mean sure we all love class quests but totem quests consist of 95% walking and 5% actual quest content.  
---
I want Kara, and maybe 1 or 2 extra mount drops throw into raids because I like earning mounts and not buying them. Add those to vanilla and Id be happy
---
I am sorry but I think it's funny ;)
---
I'm sorry :) You should play on any server type you enjoy! You go girl!
---
Do it.
---
Its a brand new world to you and I envy you for that. Just choose your faction and class and get to the adventure!!
---
&gt;I'm also dreading having pretty much one option for tank and heals for 5 Mans.
---
I might've missunderstood, but if not:
---
In vanilla there were lots of party combinations to tackle 5mans.
---
Paladings, priests, druids, shamans can heal pretty well. Latter lacks a solid rez, but you can just not wipe, or do graveyard runs.
---
Warrior and druids are equally good choice for tanking, paladin less so but doable, and shaman is also if you really can't get a tank.
---
So what one option are you referring?
---
That sir is the reason we play. To kill dragons!
---
Wow videos like this introduced me to Weird Al and JoCo. 
---
What are we compromising on? You seem to be under the impression that we are capable of bargaining with a company that could just as easily say fuck it, we aren't doing it. If they want to make every race a flying pink pony thats what they will do. 
---
**Q: "Why would you ever shard this?"**
---
A: Because being a billionaire is not enough...
---
In an MMO other players choices and playstyles affect my enjoyment as well.
---
I think they're calling it a strawman because Blizzard hasn't indicated that they want to or will shard the AQ gate opening event. The OP is arguing against something that no one has supported in the first place, hence, strawman.
---
&gt;Nowhere in the EULA or ToS I agreed to does it mention I must pay a monthly fee to play the game. To access Blizzard's SERVICES, sure.
---
​Lol pretty sure it says somewhere otherwise they would be sued by trying to sell a game which you have to pay more to play and not providing that information.  
---
&gt;Yes I have a license, but I do not need to pay money every month to maintain it. Otherwise everytime you unsubbed, you would have to uninstall it.  
---
Sure. You just don't have access to it. Its locked coz you didnt pay the rent.  
---
&gt;Again, the EULA isn't the "law". The only "law" we may discuss here is copyright, which I have not violated. I legally purchased the game and did not distribute it, data mine it, etc.  
---
Some countries have laws where you are not allowed to use piracy. You using your actual game files as opposed to torrent download doesn't mean jack shit when you are connecting to servers which allow you to play an otherwise subscription game for free.  
---
&gt;Yes, that's what I said thank you for agreeing. Vanilla =/= TBC =/= Wrath. You must be new, you used to buy expansions.  
---
Not quite sure what your point is. I don't think you do either.  
---
Why even mention other expansions? They are irrelevant.  
---
&gt;True. I did buy world of Warcraft. To access Blizzard's services, yes I do need to pay a subscription.
---
Their EULA has changed, however, I agreed to the EULA on the disk and in the client.  
---
So you are arguing that because you bought the game you are free to use piracy service such as free servers? Lol mate that's not how it works.  
---
If there is a law against using pirated games in your place, then there is definitely law against using pirated services as well.  
---
What would be bad about adding content that was slated for vanilla in the first place? 
---
10k players never existed on a single realm, hell not even 3 put together. The point was they said it couldn't be done. Even today.
---
We just did it.
---
Back then your desktop had about as much power as your cell phone and online gaming wasn't even really a thing yet, so it made sense. But we exist in the year 2019. What I really enjoy though is how this discussion somehow turned into a changes vs nochanges argument about hardware, when the point was that vanilla isn't vanilla with sharding. 
---
People keep pondering and arguing about whether such a thing like 8k stable AQ gates can even be possible when it's literally the fucking ORIGINAL POST. 
---
Someones salty :x
---
Blizzard said for a decade they would never do classic. They changed their mind because people asked for it and were unsubbing in droves due to the state of retail. Your money is your bargaining power. 
---
Simply don't train it until your GM get's so mad he gives you the 5s to do it.
---
Because I know blizzard more than you do likely.
---
Blizzard are not the same people as when wow came out. They don’t understand the game anymore. They are unable to add anything without breaking the game.
---
Best option is to just be happy we got classic and let it be.

mmm swift zulian in the distance
---
I would advise the hunter take skinning/lw. You supply pots he makes gear. If you’re going feral there’s tons of goodies in lw, and a few crafts require pots too. Then you guys can farm devilsaurs together and either find a crafter or he can crafts the set.
---
You have plenty of quests between arathi,alterac, desolace, and some Scarlet monestary. You can easily level to your 40’s skipping stv
---
The one thing I wish sooo much is that you could NS starfire.
---
Just like ele shaman with chain lighting.
---
Would be so much fun and open up new builds
---
judging by this sub, most of the people here didn’t play classic (or they ‘leveled almost to 60’) but they’ll sure tell you their opinions about it. 
---
You need 40 shards to give healthstones to everyone in the raid. 
---
If you go demonic sacrifice you've basically wasted a lot of talent points improving a pet you're gonna sacrifice. 
---
The most fun spec (conflag) isn't viable in pve 
---
Wanna use curses while raiding? Sure! As long as it's curses that buff other classes damage 
---
Do less damage than Mages til AQ 
---
Each raid only needs 2 locks til AQ 
---
What about my store mounts?
---
This. Gnome racial is to good.
---
Idk how many times I have to make it clear that the license and the terms of service are different things, covering completely different goods.
---
You tell me dude: [https://web.archive.org/web/20101212231207/http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/legal/wow\_eula.html](https://web.archive.org/web/20101212231207/http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/legal/wow_eula.html)
---
it's actually more like buying the house and not paying the electricity bill. But you said fuck it and built a wind turbine and put solar panels up. House is still yours.
---
&gt; Some countries have laws where you are not allowed to practice piracy. You using your actual game files as opposed to torrent download doesn't mean jack shit when you are connecting to servers which allow you to play an otherwise subscription game for free. 
---
Yeah the USA is one of them. Which is why I bought a disk at a store, and therefore hold a valid license unless I somehow distribute their IP illegally or gain some sort of intellectual or monetary advantage with it. I'm not, I'm using it non commercially on a single computer as required.
---
Again, I only possess the files I legally bought. You keep mentioning this word piracy. Nothing is stolen lol. You can't "pirate" a service lmfao. Piracy is taking a file you aren't allowed to have and saving it. Nothing is being saved, and if by some chance it was taking place, the host would be the distributor.
---
I'm glad there are laws against piracy, but since I legally possess my copy no laws are being violated.
---
I thought you were going to list things like AoE looting, but the things you listed would actually really affect the game.  
---
Picking a spec was supposed to be meaningful, and changing your spec later on would get costly, unless you were willing to work for it. It showed the weight of your decisions.
---
And with the paladin you use the greater blessings... Lasted 15 minutes and gave it to everyone of the same class.
---
If you get rid of reasons people have to play the game and keep people involved you'll end up with how retail is now.
---
Nah, they don't care if you datamine the game and play your own copy. It's using their IP to create a competing service that you can't do.
---
Nothing is sacred to them they are gonna have sharding, loot trading, bnet integration, no spell batching a fucked up release schedule and god knows what else. I am glad we didn't let them have an inch though! or who knows what might have happened lol
---
.... qq 
---
So why change realm pops? Gameplay in classic was not designed for 10k players on a realm. I don't care if half a million players at the gates is possible with no lag, no changes and that means no sharding, no changing realm populations and no upgrading server hardware to change the gameplay experience - everything should be exactly like it was. 
---
&gt;Idk how many times I have to make it clear that the license and the terms of service are different things, covering completely different goods.  
---
Sure, that still doesn't allow you to connect to piracy service such as private servers.  
---
&gt;it's actually more like buying the house and not paying the electricity bill. But you said fuck it and built a wind turbine and put solar panels up. House is still yours.
---
Not quite like that. It would be more similar to trying to connect to electricity even if it was cut off. Idk if I can make a closer example.  
---
&gt;Yeah the USA is one of them. Which is why I bought a disk at a store, and therefore hold a valid license unless I somehow distribute their IP illegally or gain some sort of intellectual or monetary advantage with it. I'm not, I'm using it non commercially on a single computer as required.  
---
USA doesn't allow you to use piracy service.  
---
&gt;Again, I only possess the files I legally bought. You keep mentioning this word piracy. Nothing is stolen lol. You can't "pirate" a service lmfao  
---
Yes you can. Pro tip: Game disk doesn't have half the shit on it. Most of the stuff is done server side. You just have files of it.  
---
The game world without server is empty.  
---
&gt;Piracy is taking a file you aren't allowed to have and saving it. Nothing is being saved, and if by some chance it was taking place, the host would be the distributor.  
---
Piracy is also getting something for free which you otherwise have to pay for.  
---
&gt;I'm glad there are laws against piracy, but since I legally possess my copy no laws are being violated.  
---
You are violating laws. There is a reason you cannot stream private servers on twitch. Because if twitch allowed it they would be deep in court with blizzard.  
---
Warrior leveling has a huge skillcap, you can do 5-6 days /played to 60 if you know what you're doing.
---
Also warrior can beat any class 1v1 with proper consumable usage.
---
Right, but their service is a service. You can't copyright a service. You can copyright a SERVER, in which case talk to the host cause that has nothing to do with me. I'm using their IP to play the game, which I am legally allowed to do under my license. 
---
I bought the files to make wow run, how wow runs has absolutely nothing to do with me.
---
No, no changes.
---
Yes. I got into the start of AQ40 in classic and cleared Black Temple in BC. Don’t get me wrong. I loved how awesome my vanilla rogue was at that gear level. I just feel that BC was more polished, more balanced and playable, and added some QoL changes without going overboard. And just the hype of having an expansion to the original game was insane.
---
I always really enjoyed the walking/exploring bit of WoW. Nice to just go through a path and experience the world unfold
---
Paladin (Instead of listing useless things like leveling experience and common vanilla quirks, I will list REAL annoyance.
---
1. Curse of Tongues destroy you in PvP as Holy, Restorative potions that remove it are very expensive.
---
2. Counterspell is your worst nightmare as Holy, get good at fake cast or simply die from one ability.
---
3. You HAVE to play Dwarf if you wanna seriously PvP.
---
4. You are very bad at pretty much everything PvP until you get to BWL level gear.
---
5. There always tend to be a lot of competition for gear because you want many palas to get all the buffs.
---
6. Warriors think they deserve every PvP item before you do, stand up for yourself if you want to Ret PvP.
---
7. You will get kited a lot in PvP
---
8. Robes of the Exalted is PvE BiS for a long long time, and it is one of the worst looking items ever in any game ever.
---
9. Playing against Shaman can be very frustrating, as it becomes a purge/re-seal fest.
---
10. Your ability to CC is very bad.
---
11. Sometimes it feels like you are stuck in a loop of only pushing cleanse.
---
12. Your talent trees are kinda weak compared to other classes. Rogues get prep, you get sanctity aura.
---
You might be right. I might be remembering wrong. My 486DX4 100mhz may have had 4mb. I do remember that when I finally put more ram in my pc at the time I had no issues in Ironforge :).
---
I would LOVE to reroll a shadow priest and be the raid mana battery. I was able to do that in TBC but gosh, I was terrible lol I would like to do it again now knowing H2P.
---
I like this idea. Although I'll be playing something different this time around, priest has been my main for the 14 years I've played this game.
---
Class: Priest
---
1. Your PvE and PvP specs are completely different. Guilds take at most one shadow priest to raids, and it's questionable to do that. Shadow has some big aggro problems and is best when specced into talents that reduce aggro, which is useless in pvp. PvP healers are better advised to go Discipline, as PI makes your caster friends extremely bursty, and having a large mana pool for dispelling is better anyways. You CAN get away with 21/30/0 in both, but it's not ideal in PvP.
---
2. Two of the one point perks in your Holy tree are useless. Angel form after dying is next to useless...because your main objective is to make sure people don't die. Lightwell is next to useless, because you can't get Divine Spirit if you spec it, it has a cooldown, and the heal is canceled if a character takes damage.
---
3. Inner Fire, your main armor spell, has 20 charges. It's absolutely annoying having to refresh it. In PvP, running out of charges can spell death when you have a rogue and warrior pounding on you.
---
4. You're the only healing class that can't dispel poisons without farming consumables.
---
5. You're the only full caster class without a mana regeneration mechanic.
---
6. Your racial choice is more important than it is for any other class, as priests get race specific spells. If you make the wrong choice, people assume you're a bad player.
---
7. If you don't spec shadow, you will have an awful experience soloing anything. Your mana efficiency is terrible.
---
8. Purge/Dispel Magic will rock your world more than any other class. It removes PW:F (effectively 710 damage), PW:S (effectively another 1500-ish damage), Inner Fire (\~20% physical damage debuff), Shadow Resistance (\~15% shadow damage debuff) and multiple priest racials.
---
9. Your best in slot wand anytime before Naxx is a green world drop that costs exorbitant amounts of gold.
---
10. Your entire job in PvE is to either play whack-a-mole with healthbars or keep shadow weaving stacked. If you're shadow: you won't be considered first for gear and no one cares about your very noncompetitive damage.
---
11. You will die, a lot, in groups with bad tanks. Mobs with 0 damage aggro will rush you as soon as a heal ticks.
---
12. Everyone will ask you for PW:F buff everywhere you go. It costs like 1/3rd of your mana pool and is very annoying to cast on people over and over.
---
Thanks! 
---
You sure? Just seemed that always having enchants on our gear whenever we wanted was a huge perk.
---
Good thing I built a 4,000$ gaming pc with 4K just for classic 👍
---
How is that even possible, it covers like 15 levels. Also, who doesn't like being in the jungle.
---
+1
---
hates grinding and stv - plans to play classic. 
---
real answer, no you can't if you don't grind, which you don't like either. tip: just learn how to handle and cook stv. you arent a special snowflake everyone gets through it, you too.
---
Don't sweat it. Like 99% of the people who post to this sub are like this. I'd call it a mental illness if the Classic-entitlement wasn't so darn cute.
---
But yeah, the obscene amount of entitlement in this sub is astounding.
---
thank u cakeday bot
---
like people can just download and see for themselfs on p servers, i dont get it
---
18-23? Lol
---
-Sick looking gear
---
-Smooth leveling experience
---
-Amazing in pvp against ranged
---
-Free mount at 40
---
-Cheaper mount at 60
---
-There weren't that many, so raid spots and gearing up were easier than average.
---
-You have so much raid utility and feel NEEDED.
---
-Taming DEMONS
---
-Tons of survivability
---
-Can preemptively resurrect anyone
---
-On Horde you can only be some of the two most badass races great for pvp, making crushing enemy human and gnome warlocks especially satisfying.
---
-Curse of the Elements. While it doesn't help you much, it increases the overall dps in a raid so much that it's one of the reasons you're even there.
---
Wasn't there a keyring already in vanilla? but it only shows up if you have a key to begin with
---
It's not so bad if you break up the journey with some questing/grinding.  But if you just try to go straight through it as soon as you hit 20 then yeah it kinda sucks.
---
Yeah I'm interested, but I'm not sure I like all of the design decisions. But it's definitely an example of what I'm looking for. 
---
You know what happens when you assume right?
---
That aside, I agree blizzard isn't the same since back-in-the-deh.
---
Are you quoting me?
---
Between this and invasions in dark souls I think unconsensual pvp is one of the most underutilized aspects of multiplayer games. Devs don't want to do it because of the tantrums people throw over it but the genuine bad blood it creates makes it feel so much more real. Sure, you can both agree to a 1v1 arena fight, but that is fucking boring when compared to the chaos and unpredictability of an anything goes back alley brawl. You're fighting for your life. And playing as a rogue or an invader makes you feel so devious. It's a great RPG mechanic in the true role playing sense, it's pretty core to the class identity of the rogue.
---
if theyre basically locked away in their arenas by themselves, i dont see how they do. they might as well not exist for you.
---
and the complaints about them not wanting to raid and only talking about arena seems more of a personal or guild issue.
---
No doubt, but we're talking like the top 1% of skilled warriors here.
---
The classic community doesn't want any change :D I see no reason why they should even think about any form of events - all this "micro holiday" shit of retail is just another example of wasted resources and fake-content...
---
I can think of one. Warlocks have low mobility, and not a ton of self peel. It's a pretty significant weakness in organized pvp. 
---
Lol I’m really trying to recall.   
---
I wanna say I went thousand needles to -&gt; stonetalon mountains -&gt; desolace -&gt; feralas. 
---
As long as no copywrite laws are broken, I can do whatever the hell I want. Also, the EULA and the ToS are not "the law". They are requests to be followed, but are not legally binding unless there's actual US Code that supports the argument.
---
You aren't allowed to have only one source of electricity lol. You can make your own or find another company.
---
Yes, the files are native. Only inputs from server is which one to use, damage/healing calc, position, etc.
---
You don't get it dude. Blizzard owns the game, they don't own the rights to "how multiplayer servers operate" or "transmitting data about location and damage numbers". Any Ip related to server AI would be, again, the host's responsibility.
---
The only transmitted information is WDB files, which are from that specific server. Nothing is "downloaded" every time you log in that's ridiculous. All IP is native.
---
It's empty because your client has no input for the placement and movement of that mob, so no mob exists lol. Imagine downloading onyxia every time you saw her lmao.
---
I paid for the game, I am playing the game. nothing is free except the service. However, the IP is licensed. Until Blizzard patents the transmission of mob data in an online game, that's not "IP"
---
That's really weird, cause I stream all the time \*shrug\*. Streamers who monetize their channels would be of course be breaking the law by profiting off of a host's use of blizzard's IP, and possibly a stolen client.  But since my use is noncommercial, even if the server was unauthorized, I am not violating the law.
---
Counterspell is pretty much the sole reason I opted to main warrior instead of paladin in classic. This cannot be overstated: CS -wrecks- paladins.
---
What are you playing instead?
---
&gt; Painful to drink after every 2-3 mobs while leveling.
---
Or....every dozen that you cc and aoe down pissing everyone else off who's trying to quest.
---
He'll fight you if you ask nicely.
---
&gt;Everyone just wants to see you bear dance.
---
Having the GOAT dance of all of WoW is no reason to not play a druid. 
---
False.

You are allowed to stream because there is no automatic way to detect who plays what and where.

I care
---
Personally, I'd do Skinning/Enchanting on the Hunter and herbalism/alchy on the druid.  Level an alt if you want to do tailoring/leatherworking from the supplies you gather or just farm the leather for the gear you need crafted and hire a crafter.  
---
I love love LOVE Ret Paladin in vanilla, everything about it, but it does have some issues...and most aren't even gameplay ones :\
---
1: No one will take you seriously
---
2: People will hate you despite how nice/helpful you are just because you're a ret paladin
---
3: I have gotten literal death threats against me for being a ret paladin
---
4: You'll get hate mail/whispers just standing around
---
5: Pull good DPS and people say paladin is broken and you have no skill
---
6: Pull bad DPS and people say it's because you're a ret paladin
---
7: Blessings are short (5 minutes and 15 minutes for greater)
---
8: You run oom fast if you don't stack gorilla gear (Int and strength)
---
9: Druids seem to do everything better and more (Stealth, taunt, Imp MOTW is better than kings, thorns deals more damg than ret aura)
---
10: People will bug you to heal nonstop
---
11: Your mount costs a decent chunk of mana because it's a spell, making you eventually run oom (balances out in the 50s but at 40 it's costly)
---
12: Did I mention everyone will hate you for no reason?
---
I feel like this is the winner. But I think we all kinda knew druid would win.
---
I really wish they add all the zones that were inaccessible + finish the unfinished zones like dustwallow + some minor, very minor class balance to make some specs more viable. I don't have high hopes for that but they'll need to find a way justify their monthly fee when their competition is free.
---
quality of life changes ruined retail
---
People have been bitchin about gettin tanked for 14 got damn years, maybe come this round they will finally learn that PvP maybe just ain’t for them.
---
You animal.
---
back then, in original Vanilla, there was no "3 years down" - it was TBC already
---
He can live after he gives up his Sinew, I need my fancy quiver!
---
I'm quite undecided atm.
---
In order of my current likelihood, this is what I might play:
---
1. Druid - I like wPvP and stealth is king for that. If I'm playing with the competent group of PvP'ers that I currently play with, I won't mind being a healer, crowd controller, and flag runner. Druids are also the easiest class to gear if you plan on healing, as there is little class competition for gear.
---
2. Rogue - Again, wPvP. Rogue is the best ganking class. I have rogue experience and overall think they're, perhaps, the funnest class in Vanilla.
---
3. Warlock - Insane amounts of crowd control and little gear competition. They can spec bursty or survivability. Some of the coolest armor design in the game.
---
4. Enhancement Shaman - Windfury. Enough said lol.
---
Main: warrior. Alt: mage or rogue. Haven't settled yet.
---
Paid about $700 for 7900GTX when that came out and it was obsolete in a couple years. Nowadays with $700 on a graphics card you run everything on maximum or near that until the end of the generation (5-7 years). It's mainly because games are built with consoles in mind, so you don't need to have the highest end specs to max out games, but still.
---
Well that's the difference between PvP and griefing. 
---
&gt;When I die and my pet dies, reviving it says "you have no pet". How is this supposed to work? Are you intended to need to charm a new pet each time you die?
---
Your pet probably ran away from low loyalty.  Feed the pet and keep it happy.  If you don't have the type of food your pet needs, head to town and buy a stack of it. 
---
&gt;When you first charm a pet, the loyalty meter yoyos. Is there a point when your pet will never run away? Or is it always possible to run away if you don't feed it enough?
---
It's a happiness meter. Keep the pet happy at all times and over time it will gain loyalty. At lower levels of loyalty, the pet will become unhappy more often.  The higher the loyalty level the less food the pet needs to keep it happy.  At the max loyalty level, you only have to feed your pet every few hours of gameplay or when it dies.
---
&gt;Pets seem to not hold aggro. On retail, pets tank and can hold threat while you DPS. Is this not the case in Classic?
---
There's a skill that shows up in your general skill tab that lets you train your pet with abilities.  The first ability you need to train is growl so that it will hold aggro.  Make sure you right click on the ability to make it auto-cast.
---
Check www.wow-petopia.com/classic to learn what abilities you can learn and add to your pet.
---
well, it's not connected to Blizzard, but it's linked on wowhead, and, for some reason, it's show even on the "thottbot" section of wowhead
---
Anyway, I agree with you here. Thank you for reminding.
---
In solo PVP I would agree.  in organized, we have backup to cover those weak spots 
---
Loot trading will change the very nature of groups and does nothing but promote negativity.
---
Solution to the issue: Nothing. No seriously, Blizzard should do nothing. No loot trading, no tickets for loot, nothing.
---
Loot should matter and you should have to learn and realise this. You'll be fine the first time you fuck up, but after that the community will crucify you as it should.
---
Loot trading is a BfA mindset change in order to solve an issue that doesn't exist.
---
well, those that go DPS
---
Back then in vanilla, almost everybody was "shy" of being a tank or healer. But, I've played on several private servers, and it was the HEALER that was in top supply and lowest demand. It was actually BETTER to be DPS (in terms of looking for group)
---
And pally buff duration effects mana efficiency. Even if you change the mana cost to account for it it'll still affect pvp.
---
I'm not worried in the least. It just shifted leveling priority from Druid-&gt;Shaman to Shaman-&gt;Druid.
---
I lose weight when I play games too much. I normally work out a lot so when I stop and be lazy I just lose my appetite and stop eating nearly as much.
---
Think of it like this.    
---
There are tons of storylines. Some are small and self-contained. Some are medium-sized which conclude in dungeons. And some start out small in the lower levels, lead into a high-level dungeon (or two), and finally conclude in a raid.    
---
In this way, it's organized very differently from any other iteration of WoW. Since you've never played vanilla and you enjoy the story, I'd urge you to not skip quests and read closely. It really isn't as fragmented as some say, but it does require the player to pay close attention. Which is why they started revising the questing system, I'm sure.
---
You're welcome dude.
---
I'm starting Shaman and Druid but leveling the druid on rest xp only. Shaman will be my priority and preferred class on the lead'ish wave to raiding.
---
Thank you for the clutch sauce
---
you are doing godly work here! 
---
Must not have played much wc3
---
this is correct.  and in your low 40s you can start in Tanaris 
---
Wasn't it supposed to be July 16th?
---
Fire becomes viable during AQ40 with good gear, I linked a guide below to someone else, check it out it has a bunch of good mage info including builds.
---
**Warlock!**
---
1. The second easiest class to level below Hunter and some might even argue that the Warlock is the best.
---
2. Incredible survivability and sustain, a whole cornucopia of all sorts of spells tailor made to make your life easiest.
---
3. You can summon freaking *demons*!
---
4. You get a free mount at level 40 and a badass epic mount for a lot less than any other class would play (except Paladins).
---
5. The most unique class. While the others have their roots in common fantasy tropes, the Warlock is the only class that doesn't.
---
6. You can summon anyone anywhere at any time. 
---
7. In raids Warlocks are primarily a support class, meaning you're there to help the other DPS get fatter numbers. So you have a convenient excuse for being low on the meters! If you actually like topping the meters then wait until AQ and Naxx!
---
8. Our tier sets look incredible... The other classes don't even come close, well, except the Paladins... *again*... ^^^Bastards.
---
9. Other classes buy their reagents, we make our own by taking someone's dying soul and stuffing it into a tiny crystal shard... You don't get any more metal than that!
---
10. Warlock is incredibly fun and rewarding to play in PvP, unlike other classes you actually need to know what you're doing to be any good.
---
11. Our lore characters are all either demons or megalomaniacal Orc puppet masters. 
---
12. Perfect class to play if you're a metalhead, the whole class just screams METAL!  
---
&gt; Rogues who only engage in unfair fights.
---
They are probably suffering PTS from geting marked by hunters from 50 yards away while killing 2 mobs.
---
Rogue lives matter.
---
As a fury warrior you will want to run a slow main hand weapon for high damage window for HS / Whirlwinds, and a fast offhand for rage generation through whatever the talents called which gives you a chance to proc rage from melee attacks :) 
---
In vanilla I'm not sure if this works because there were a lot less graveyards then. Even if it does work why would you want to miss out on the authentic vanilla experience? 
---
Now that's a crystal clear answer 🤩
---
Hunter
---
1.  First Tier raid damage in MC/BWL/AQ, Naxx is first or second tier depending on raid boss. For example [in this boss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUzWiQF1fMg) I did great in Naxx, I am one of the hunters in vid. 
---
2. Viper Sting - Second most OP pvp ability in game, next to stealth. Able to wipe a mana bar in 15-20 seconds. 
---
3. Best 1v1 duel class in game - With Viper sting, traps, scatter, pet, conc shot, cheetah and everything else, hunter is far ahead of any other class in duels. Before someone refutes this, if you are a mana user, see point 2. You don't stance a chance against a great hunter duelist. 
---
4. Best looking gear in game. Tier 1 looks a bit goofy but Tier 2 and 3 which you will use for most of vanilla is the best in game. 
---
5. KT Xbow - Most of you will not believe me but I actually obtained this item. I could rant for 10 paragraphs how amazing it was to hold this beast. My heart was racing 150bpm when I looted this item. I was an avid pvper and was already scary without it. After I got it, i felt like I turned a god-mode switch on my hunter. I was able to 2 shot most classes with tier 1 or blues. It was the most fun I had in any game ever, and it is my main goal of Classic, to get this again. 
---
6. Pets - They add some flavor and fun to the class. Feeding pets and checking hapiness actually makes levelling kind of interesting in between long walks especially. They do great in pvp also and will make cloth users to curse at you. 
---
7. Feign Death - One of the most useful abilities on hunter. Allowing you to do interesting stuff like farming Dire Maul by running past dozens of mobs and using feign death. Stops casters from casting their current spell, so very powerful in pvp also. 
---
8. Flare - One of the best feelings as a hunter is catching a rogue and punishing him/her for it. 
---
9. Easy to level - The best class in game to level easily. World record times are achieved only on hunters for 1-60. 
---
10. Easier than most classes to acquire gear in guilds - Most guilds will run 2-3 hunters, mine ran with 2 in retail vanilla. I was able to stack gear up fast because it was only just me and 1 more hunter. 
---
11. Extremely strong in pvp from Tier 1 all the way to Tier 3 + KT xbow. Most classes start weak and become strong by Tier 3. Hunters are powerful in pvp from the moment you ding 60 until you loot that KT xbow. 
---
12. Fun to play - for me nothing else comes close to the amount of fun hunter offers. I played a hunter in retail vanilla exclusively. I loved him so much I never bothered to play another class past level 25. 
---
Yeah, I had thought about the skinning/enchanting route. Wouldn't have to worry about buying higher level leather and devilsaur leather.
---
How do youget from 35 to 45 without STV?
---
As has already been said, constantly camping lowbies that have no way to fight back isn't PvP. Maybe if you don't have the skill to fight in proper PvP after 14 years, PvP just ain't for you.
---
- You can wear and hence roll on every weapon
---
- tame a pet and even name it like Bigchungus
---
- 41yd range
---
- traps and tracking. feel like a true ranger 
---
- you don't have to worry about dps meters. well, at least don't let the tanks overtake you
---
- trinket swop in combat
---
- you can mark your mortal enemies with a big fat arrow. basically saying: Attack here!
---
- your group sux? feign death and watch them losers die
---
- wanna see whats going on at the other part of the map, but too lazy to go? use eagle eye to see up to 50k yd 
---
- you can role play famous characters. On alliance just pick NE and name yourself something like xxlegolazxx or on horde Orc and Rexxor
---
- actually usefull tier sets
---
- your pet is like a tamagotchi mini game. You have to treat it well and feed it all the time
---
Bwahahaha...I never saw this in the day. Thank you so much for the laughs!
---
RNG is more important and can completely change the tide of battle. Getting a Soul Fire crit or something similar is deadly. DPS Paladins and Shamans were all about procs and were able to burst you down ...if they are lucky. It's ... kind'a like gambling.  
---
Retail WoW pretty much nerfs all oneshot/strong abilities whenever they appear. The RNG/crit factor is also balanced out so that Competitive PvP players wouldn't even think about blaming it. Because of this everything goes with the expectable pace.
---
Yup that’s been said for 14 years and blizzard ain’t gonna change it and the players won’t ever change so why waste you breath saying it. Guess what I ain’t even a rogue and I don’t yank lowbies but I hate hearing this over and over again it’s maddening after 14 years.
---
Fucking rogues. Cheapest class in the game.
---
Love,

Cloth wearer
---
"QoL" changes like those you propose are what made retail the entitlement filled horrible dull mess that it is. Also your proposed changes make immense difference in gameplay and design.
---
- Respec costs are like they are because you're not supposed to change specs often, you're supposed to pick one and play it. An intentional game design decision.
---
- Some buffs are meant to be active gameplay elements, you are removing that with the proposed change.
---
No changes is the only way to guarantee the game is anything playable and does not become retail immediately when vocal retail players get their say and want to repeat tragic history again.
---
I played Vanilla, but I was like 7 or 8 so I can hardly remember it. The thing I remember most was how big the world was and how easy it was to get sucked in. I had that childish innocence so I became really invested in story lines and things such as not wanting to kill an animal. One thing that comes to mind was killing Princess, because the quest text said she became too big and I was like "that's not her fault I don't want to kill her!"
---
I mean, I get that. I even agree that at a certain point just go to a PvE server, since most PvP is in BGs. My only problem with it, is that I don't understand why a person would ever be down with that kind of activity. The odd one here and there, sure, but there used to be people just grief the hell of one person, then the next, etc. At that point, you're kind of a shit person imo. It's like the people that use aimbots in a FPS and then talk shit, or even worse get pissed when people still kill them because they're actually shit lol
---
Terrible at farming?
---
Either you're doing something wrong, or I'm some sort of wizard
---
It's called being a troll. It's not against the rules. I used to enjoy getting the hate messages. It's also a great way to stoke some PVP in a zone. Yeah it sucks being the victim. But it's just how it is. Roll on a PVE server if you don't want this to happen . Because it will happen

Warriors dont want you in dungeons, because you share gear needs

Shamans dispell your seals

Hard to get ret items in raid (because its your offspec)

You will save people lifes with bop, but nobody will thank you, they will probably curse you

Slow to lvl

No gap closer/slows

Hmm im still rolling a paladin
---
Didn’t that person say that it would come out on July 16th because that’s when they’ll be on vacation?
---
I actually enjoy the danger of being ganked, makes the world feel dangerous and more alive. Not even worried about getting camped there are a bunch of ways to avoid it, besides just takin a break.
---
Three even. RFD, RFK and WC
---
Well this is not in vanilla time for sure, no treant form...
---
haha, I remeber that one. No I was speaking about the one from Blizzcon with the gnomes names
---
Meant phasing, you knew that
---
Summer 2019 is when they said the release would be. Nothing more concrete than that
---
I dont know why people are downvoting youhere. Having a system where players could vote on content would appease everyone. Majority will decide what will happen with the expansion as opposed to a vocal minority screaming and throwing fits until Blizzard gives in.
---
I wanna say I went thousand needles to -&gt; stonetalon mountains -&gt; desolace -&gt; feralas.
---
Yeah, if I'm getting camped with Warmode on, for instance, I just log or leave the zone. It's only really frustrating to me because I just don't get the fun in it. Roll into town, murk a few fools, carry on to the next place, but I've seen *way* too many people just grief 
---
You killed my maiiiinneee!
---
People think that the release date is July 16th because of a possible [Easter egg from the Blizzcon Classic Panel](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9u755q/classic_release_date_july_16th_2019/)
---
[That depends on what you believe.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9u755q/classic_release_date_july_16th_2019/)
---
Of course I have permission lol. How else would I have the disc/client? It's called buying.
---
That would just be flat out stealing.
---
You know the funniest part about this? 
---
**BLIZZARD DOESN'T OFFER SERVICE FOR MY CLIENT**
---
Your argument is honestly fuckin hilarious. So you're telling me to go pay blizzard for a service which they don't offer. "You're breaking the law because you aren't paying blizzard for a service they don't have."
---
So even if you had a point, there's no way to satisfy your demands. 
---
That's called breach of contract. B
---
At this point, unless I'm openly distributing their IP or running a server as for-profit, you have no legal standing because I've done nothing malicious. I honored my agreement and they breached contract.
---
We can debate all day long because the laws haven't been fully settled. it's potato potahto. But at the end of the day, nobody cares about people who play a video game they bought. That service would fall under "no longer supported" and at that point a third party solution is reasonable. You don't get to have your cake and eat it too
---
If I were you, I'd spend more time worrying about real issues in the world like homelessness and lack of clean water instead of if some kid should be sued for being able to play an old video game.
---
I mean, it isn't perfect still, but restricting loot trading to master loot situations only at least minimizes the amount of exploitation/abuse that comes with it.
---
Shift-click? Bruh, do you even Aux?

---
Keep that mindset and say good bye to raiding
---
&gt;and its mia
---
That's actually the phasing tech. You need to complete some quests in order to kill it.
---
Oh god yeah. It's so hard.
---
What about herb/skinning for druid and enchanting/LW for hunter? At 60, drop skinning for alch and LW for engineering or whatever else you want. You could go ahead and level LW to get your BoE bis items, or you could drop it all together and take mining for cash.
---
You can give all the skins to the hunter, and since you are both leather/mail you can make gear; and LW actually makes a decent amount of greens for you to DE. It also keeps cloth open, so the hunter can level first aid, and it gives you nice stacks to trade in for rep or AH for gold.
---
It also puts all your gathering profs on your druid, who will have an extra bag slot.
---
Curious mostly but I've never played a rogue or a pally. I've heard a lot about rogue leveling being cancer. Can you elaborate on that a little bit. I'd like to think they are up there with warrior leveling as far as difficulty but I just dont know. It's all hear say.
---
No effects? What? Is this a joke? For example respec costs have a serious impact. You or someone else (guild?) have to farm the gold. Or you have to level an alt. Let's just stop here.
---
But of course this is immaterial. We want Vanilla, not Vanilla+ or whatever. With everything that entails.
---
It's the difference between having a fighting chance vs being killed repeatedly without having any means of escape or fighting back
---
&gt;Of course I have permission lol. How else would I have the disc/client? It's called buying.  
---
No you don't. You are unable to play WoW without subscription.  
---
Its not a buy to play game.  
---
&gt;That would just be flat out stealing.
---
You know the funniest part about this?  
---
These are just some mental gymnastics in order to justify yourself. It doesn't work. Because they are based on false information.  
---
&gt; BLIZZARD DOESN'T OFFER SERVICE FOR MY CLIENT  
---
There is no such thing as "service for my client".  
---
Blizzard still offers the service for the game you bought. You disliking the patches that come with it is irrelevant.  
---
&gt;Your argument is honestly fuckin hilarious. So you're telling me to go pay blizzard for a service which they don't offer.  
---
They very much do.  
---
&gt;"You're breaking the law because you aren't paying blizzard for a service they don't have."
---
So even if you had a point, there's no way to satisfy your demands.  
---
They are providing the service.  
---
I don't see you crying about them not providing you with version 1.00 of vanilla wow. Would that still be grounds for your argument that they are not providing version for "your client". No.  
---
&gt;That's called breach of contract.  
---
EULA is not law. You said so yourself.  
---
&gt;At this point, unless I'm openly distributing their IP or running a server as for-profit, you have no legal standing because I've done nothing malicious. I honored my agreement and they breached contract.  
---
False. You are using their product without permission. Which is illegal in USA. So you are in fact, breaking the law.  
---
&gt;​If I were you, I'd spend more time worrying about real issues in the world like homelessness and lack of clean water instead of if some kid should be sued for being able to play an old video game.  
---
Completely irrelevant and this is you just trying to change the theme.  
---
You are breaking the copyright law, which clearly states that you are not allowed to use copyrighted works without permission. You do not have permission if you do not have subscription active.  
---
No amount of mental gymnastics will do you any good.  
---
How you enjoy folks, sorry for the delay for those that have come to expect  these, somehow corrupted all of my audio files.
---
If I were to do a giveaway soon, what would people be interested in winning?
---
bahaha, I'm good, those are relics dude, hold onto them ;)
---
Every time I get to stv I ask myself why I rolled a warrior again.  
---
Juicy trinket you’ll use unto 60 sign me up!
---
But yeh I’ve been like 4 times and all what are orange and for warrior might as well be red 
---
Other people answered 1 and 2 so I'll just elaborate on 3. In addition to growl, if you are still having problems with aggro, you've got a couple options:
---
- Higher damage pets, like cats, can hold aggro better. Keep claw and bite maxed.
---
- BM hunter with increased pet damage and crit will let them hold aggro better as well
---
- Make sure you let your pet pull aggro. Wait for it to actually initiate aggroing the mob, let it growl and get its bite off, then start DPS. 
---
- You'll notice you'll start pulling off faster the closer you get to the next rank of growl, so when you start pulling off more you need to start playing conservatively with pet threat.
---
- Boars are nice because the charge will make it so they almost always pull aggro, even if you are impatient, but they do less damage (and therefore generate less threat) than other pets.
---
- Get a threat meter and track when you are close to pulling. A lot of times you can just get a chain of a few crits and pull off without noticing.
---
- You can use disengage to drop threat, but it will eat up mana and it makes you need to reposition. It's only a backup if the rest of that fails.
---
- You shouldn't be over-DPSing as a hunter. It's very mana inefficient, and you'll start pulling off your pet. You should find the sweet spot where you are able to grind consistently with zero downtime, with the possible exception of feeding or bandaging your pet.
---
Look up ret pally on icy veins or Google. They do the dps.
---
I'm currently playing on a private server, and there's a guy who has been ganking low levels with his *pet* in Stonetalon.
---
He has been doing it nonstop, several hours every day since *tuesday*. He even has *two* level one players from our faction in Sun Rock Retreat which he uses to /rofl at and teabag his victims. 
---
He also chimes in with "Sssss!" in general chat whenever anyone points out the ganking. (His pet's name is called Salt, and his level 1 character is called Saltthesnake, hence the "Ssss"). 
---
I can handle a little bit of ganking while I'm questing (I think STV is fine), but this is on another level. I almost admire the persistence. 
---
money is responsible. They will go where money is
---
&gt;Statistically speaking, your PC on idle (not sleep) already uses up to 75% of it's total power draw
---
Did you think before typing that? Do you know what 75% of it's total power draw actually means?
---
Sorry but that sounds like bullshit, where did you read that?
---
Hi, /u/west_coastG
---
Rogue with an unortodox spec. (ie daggers).
---
also take a look at hunters.
---
It was less of a problem once people started gettting gear and moving forward in the content or if you had a warlock in your party, I definitely was not invited as a healer due to being a Druid before. 
---
This made my day lol.
---
When I was a rogue I’d always let the little guys go if I was 60 in stv unless it was a fg or something. 
---
Maiming one person who can’t defend themselves is shitty.
---
Pissing off 8 people of the opposite realm is fun af.
---
Go get it from the frost dragons in that cave.
---
Hunter, Mage or Warlock. 
---
You could try Shaman. You could play enhancement to level, and at 60 get the axe nightfall, and you should be able to find a guild that will bring you along for the debuff.
---
Still a mana class, but if you manage your resources and front load your spells you won’t have to stop and drink unless you have a near death experience. 
---
I posted your picture to my site, https://legacy-wow.com
---
I included credit to your username with a link back to this thread to help your karma game :P
---
Thanks for the hard work and cool image to share!
---
Would rather murder the big dragon instead!
---
There's a weekly Wednesday thread for this. Your post might get removed
---
Not getting to 60 in Vanilla doesn’t discount your opinions. I got to 55 before BC launched, and for a noob, that’s a *long* time to play. And that was most people who played too. It probably took 10 days to get there, which is 240 hours. That’s enough to say I’ve experienced the game pretty thoroughly. 
---
If argue Shadow Priests are best 1v1 in game tbh
---
I’ll whinge and repeat it every time... Loot actually matters in Vanilla dungeons, it will be abused even *more* than it was in retail. I’d prefer no system whatsoever than loot trading :/
---
The 1 AM isn't get in stone. It's just a window of when we could/might raid.
---
Idk if it will help but going druid hunter with the gf. Probably have her go skin + lw or mining. Me I'd go herb enchant to compliment, reason being is I'm going feral tank, so I want the smoking heart trinket (265 ench). That's just mean tho.  
---
For duo leveling your best combo is cover the gatherings, skin, herb, mine. Then go alch, lw or Bs to compliment on one of you
---
It depends on what you what your endgoal is, whether it's doing dungeons, PVPing or raiding, because the answers are going to differ most likely. 
---
At first I did not like it due to the timers. 15min is so short. Then I remember totem times and buffs. Lol and I'm playing druid.  
---
I still think shaman weapon buffs and pally buffs should be longer, but I don't really care cause I'm not playing pally
---
Pretty sure there's a maximum possible range for stealth detection.
---
Basically shit all for end game lel 
---
Solid reasoning. And I get chewed out on this sub for complaining about shift + clicking every mob to loot (as opposed to no shift). People are nuts here, hopefully they stay focused on the big stuff. Loot trading, sharding, right click report.
---
Gnome mage is just superior to human. Both PvP and PvP. You don't need to avoid a rogue opener to beat them.
---
Um, I didn't 'read' it anywhere. It's one of the basics when it comes to conventional setups. A PC  never gets max power draw on idle and during most games. A GPU might say 350W required, and the CPU might need 50W, but that doesn't mean they are always drawing that much. They only get near that maximum TDP when severely overclocked or running some special type of software.
---
Literally all of those can be used at anytime while leveling.
---
 Especially #10...which is easy leveling
---
It's pretty easy to fuck over a mage trying to aoe grind, though. Just break the pack with cc. Also just pulling mobs as they respawn if you're competing for mobs is usually just better because aoe packs are rarely synchronised on respawn timers.

Tfw I was going to play Shaman
---
I love when I'm leveling an alt and get ganked. Once? Okay, fair enough, that's PvP. Twice? Well then, it seems I will be camped with no possibility for peace, so I'm bringing my main and camping you until you log. I have spent upwards of 6 hours camping one person because he tried camping my alt. You better be able to take it if you're  going to dish it because I'm in it for the long haul if you. Most log out after 3+ ganks.
---
Come on, while PvP is part of the game, camping unprovoked is just kinda lame.
---
Please stop calling it ganking griefing because ganking on a PvP server is NOT griefing. There is a PvP solution for it. It is absolutely not like using an aimbot (cheat).
---
You may not like it, but it is designed to be part of the game.
---
Yeah I’m not sure what it is if there is one but if there wasn’t it would be 40 yards unless they have 5 points in sub then it would be 35.  The way this guy was talking was making it seem like a level 60 could just see anyone low level in stealth at any range. 
---
40.0 yards ≈ 36.6 metres ^(1 yard ≈ 0.92m)
---
Don’t like to rely on mana? Don’t like to be immobile? Only DPS? Go hunter! They aren’t mainstream in endgame either, but they’re easy to level. 
---
Just be sure, that for 1-10 especially, you learn to run between shots to get more shots in, and weave your instants with your autos.
---
Bad bot
---
My guess is that it's because they're so squishy, they can't really stand their ground against many enemies. But they have stealth so it cancels out.
---
yeah, you're most probably right D:
---
completely agree with you! I was just highlighting that it might be a fruitless struggle to try and convince blizz otherwise :(
---
Rogue
---
1. Overpopulated
---
2. Bottom tier leveling
---
3. Garbage in BGs
---
4. Garbage in Large scale wPvP
---
5. Random people asking for lockpicks
---
6. If you're horde you deal with Stoneform, Perception and Paladins
---
7. If you're alliance you deal with Orcs
---
8. Any PvP achievement is downplayed because of their perceived power
---
9. Their perceived power is considerably higher than their actual power
---
10. The raiding PvE spec is awful at PvP, and even worse if you're daggers
---
11. Seal Fate is immensely disappointing 
---
12. DoTs heavily limit how you can use stealth and vanish

I'm adapting my [pain cave](https://i.imgur.com/6HdhWdM.jpg) to accommodate my gaming rig instead of a laptop.

I'll get to 60 in under 120 hours whilst riding 2,000 miles and burning 72,000 calories.
---
That means I can lose 22 pounds OR eat all the hot pockets I want all day every day and still lose 5 pounds.
---
\#bikedesk is best desk
---
yeah i always thought counter spell was very op. 10 second lockout and if you fake cast then its still a 4 second silence. also why not just let a healer have a free cast before using cs and watch him waste his time trying to juke when your launching 2k crit frostbolt
---
&gt;swop
---
There's no reason why they couldn't release this. Azshara was basically Cataclysmed, so they wouldn't have any obligation to add it to the main game. It'd be ok/cool if they did though! BGs for both versions of the game with just 1 dev cycle.
---
Imo they should just change Blessings to be 30 mins and group 60.
---
Nah, he's definitely wrong about that. Unless my memory is completely flawed.
---
I'm thinking that max detection radius is around 15-20 yards.
---
ok...somebody had a hard time playing shaman and rolled a different class i'm guessing. half the stuff is just completely wrong.
---
&gt;You spec into imp arcane missiles and spam the ability until you get a free pyroblast.
---
That works? That's hilarious.
---
RationalWiki is hardly an objective 'source' to judge anyone by. They don't even try to hide their bias. 
---
My suggestion to you is to watch some of his lectures and to make up your own mind about Peterson. Anyone who has watched a decent amount of his stuff knows he's not part of some "alt-right", "religious-right" or "white supremacist" movement.
---
You might disagree with the guy and THAT IS FINE. It's no sweat off anyone's back to have a different view. But it doesn't make him your enemy, or you his, or indeed anyone else you happen to disagree with about politics. 
---
You can see even here folk downvote like crazy as soon as they see his name, it's like he's attacked them personally or something and they don't even want to listen to what someone might have to say. It's crazy, man.

---
&gt; why would they go out of their way to remove UI features
---
Because thats the point of the project and because they said they would.
---
Those are all the reasons you need. I fact, they had already removed many UI elements in the Blizzcon demo. And they will continue to.
---
My favorite is a rogue who ganks my warrior sub 25% and magically evaporates to one overpower / MS crit.
---
Seriously let me just kill my dudes. No bad blood nothing I just wanted to kill boars
---
My main will be a Mage, but since I'll be PvE alliance, I am considering rolling a Shaman to experience the other side.
---
Griefing is what I turn too when they won’t leave me alone.
---
Kill me once great shit happens.
---
Twice, I’m camping you for the next 5 hours so you can do literally nothing but try to run away.
---
Hope it was worth it
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcasm
---
No....just NO!
---
Starter Character will be Hunter for speed leveling/farming.
---
"Mains" will be fury/prot Warrior &amp; shadow/Heal priest for 5mans/raids.
---
After that it will be mage, pal, druid and lock.
---
Hate the rogue fantasy &amp; playstyle. giving that a skip.
---
I would suggest trying a private server for some time. Play the classes you think you might like and get a feel for what you want to main when Classic launches.
---
Garbage in BGs and the pvp/pve spec is awful?
---
Rogues are a blast in BG’s, especially AB. 
---
And the pvp/pve spec is better than shamans or priests who have to go full heal specs for pve.  
---
main will be warrior
---
alt will be rogue so I can gank and camp lowbies 
---
I'm going to be leveling a couple classes. Starting with my most used character to my least used characters.  
---
Warrior  
---
Warlock  
---
Priest  
---
Mage  
---
Paladin  
---
Rogue  
---
Hunter  
---
Druid  
---
Warlock level 35 as many times as I can possibly achieve.  
---
**How many will I actually level though because like most players my ambitions are far greater than my abilities?**  
---
Ooooooooooor, here me out here, we play Vanilla, the best game ever created in the history of mankind.
---
There's a direct quote saying it's only for early zones. Not to mention every other quote discussing the experience they want to deliver.
---
I just wanna play Vanilla, the best game I have ever played, and people like you wanna take that away. That makes me sad.
---
A PvP server with the rogue class disabled could be fun
---
If you're talking about PUGs absolutely, rogues are insanely low impact in BGs. For shamans and priests they are way more impactful because having healers at all is generally the deciding factor in pug vs pug (and they both have offensive dispels, and priest has defensive dispels as well). 
---
"Pvp/pve spec" doesn't mean anything, it could just be the PvE spec in PvP (which I would take it as), or it could be something like 30/0/21 shaman.
---
And a huge one on the social aspect because then you have more tanks and healers and don´t need to be nice to them.
---
Ret paladins were super OP right before TBC came out 
---
&gt;Back in the day, if you were a casual player, 50g was a very large amount. If you wanted to be switching between PvE and PvP on a consistent basis it meant you HAD to spend a good amount of time farming to pay for the respecs.
---
If you HAVE to respec, you are not a casual player my friend. 
---
America fuck yeah. I was being unironically sarcastic.
---
Anyone here have experience with balance at 60?  Any tips or tricks.  I'm currently motw resto spec and I'm loving it.  I really want to try balance, but don't want to invest the time and gold to get the gear if it's as shit as they say it is.
