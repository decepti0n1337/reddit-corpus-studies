Gnome anything. I basically kos gnomes because if I don’t then the little assholes will be getting me when I’m low on health.
---
---
---
Nope. In Hinterlands (where this quest is from) there are plenty running around under the surface.
---
For a main tank or off tank? Sure. Flask of the Titans is huge. But the guild bank likely covers this (it should). 
---

---
For others? Flasks are overkill unless speed run or some type of challenge fun (under 20). 
---
A mongoose pot, arcane elixir, or the like is nice. If you use these, you will want a few. 
---
Food for Stam buffs, mana regen, or the like is nice. It’s super cheap too. 
---
Some mana pots and health pots are nice. 
---
Having a cleansing potion (forget name off the top of my head) or two makes some fights easier. 
---
Having fire resistance pots for ragnaros is nice. 
---
All in all maybe 10-20g in consumables on the high end. And much less is perfectly fine.
---
They always jump on when they use their Arcane Explosions which makes them seem like evil mathemagicians who understand how to maximize the radius of a sphere in three-dimensional space.
---
What class are you? Very few people actually flask at this point it's a waste of gold for looking good on meters. I almost make back the gold i use for consumes from boss kills. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
As a rogue I use:
---
3 mongoose at most. 2 greater arcane protection pots, 2 FAP's, 1 resto pot, 2 fire protection(not greater) pots, about 10 squids and juju's. That's maybe 40g in consumes per week, and I think you make like 25?
---
I've cleared all my brd quests and gotten MC attunement already. Ony attune I'm stuck trying to get into an ubrs run and never have any luck getting guildies to run it sadly. And yes I definitely understand that last part it's just painful dealing with pugs non-stop.
---
I grew up in Azeroth. I have seen races having sex in every position imaginable. Dwarf on Tauren. Tauren on dwarf. Couple of Tauren doing a Dwarf, couple of gnomes watching.
---
126 runs it took me
---
With the emergence of pay to win systems in recent game releases Classic is a reminder of a time before game companies became as greedy as they are today. Something else can be said about nothing in the game being purchasable with real money. Anything is attainable by any player but it requires varying degrees of time and dedication.
---
You are not a ninja but you're an enormous pussy. Stop being so affraid of people.
---
Someone at my work paid $500 to one of these groups. Someone else nearly western unioned thousands to a man in Africa to buy his rare puppy from him, luckily I saw the email and got to them before they left for lunch to warn them it's a scam.
---
Because unlike boes, the value of bops can differ substantially from player to player depending on the situation and most people are reasonable enough to forgo the 3-5g vendor value so that a member of the group can extract that full value.
---
I picked shaman because it is the best class. The only class. Hands down. Those who don’t agree obviously just don’t understand. :)
---
yup
---
I hate tricky mob skipping. Skippig a tight pat or a group a mobs thay give you 2yards of non aggro.. im a tank and i usually pull them but when i dont tank prople seem like they wanna skip all the time
---
I have a prebis 60 rogue and rolled another one on faerlina who is also pre bis 60, but I wanna use my first one cuz friends didnt switch over. So shut ur fat ugly mouth about laziness.
---
I don't mean that I mind other people questing around me. I was annoyed that I would ask in the local chats if anyone wanted to team up, and it was like everyone forgot how a keyboard worked.
---
Lots of Terrible advice in this thread. It is common sense that people fulfilling heal / tank rolls might not be main spec’d for the aforementioned role. 
---
If you want to reserve something, you do it before the dungeon starts. In the case of your group, the cape was explicitly not reserved (and good luck finding a tank if it is deserved lol).
---
It is not your job to impress upon everyone in the group what pieces of loot you might be interested in. You rolled need on an item you needed. By no stretch of the imagination is that “ninja looting”
---
It was just a question.  
---
Extreme imbalances lead to dead servers and no pvp or do you prefer the odds stacked in your favour?
---
Dwarf rogues.  I’ve never seen a dwarf rogue that wasn’t hostile.
---
As a mage farming DM East a ton, I'm not entirely convinced they shouldn't just be renamed to 'Nat Pagles guide to fishing'. Over 40 tomes looted, and 40 nat pagles guides ive had to manually delete since the vendor doesnt want them.
---
Do rogues ever get thunder fury any more? 
---
I’m remember when we have a thunder fury to our rogue in like 2006.
---
You don’t use combo points for anything else?
---
Expected it to be 55 45 at most
---
Depends on server, some are still very busy and always have stuff going on, some are smaller and seem mostly guild based, some seem dead and likely will be merged at some point
---
but you gave a warrior hand of rag &gt;.&lt;
---
Healing the friendly target will generate initial threat on pull so they all come to you instead of them!
---
They're just trying to buy mats at prices they can profit with.
---
Scams like this aren't for trade goods, they're for like 50G+ rare items
---
COD is a great tool for people to trading between cities or bulk buying trade goods as a dedicated buyer.  It's worth doing an in person trade if multiple hours worth of gold farming at max level is about to trade hands.
---
My man!
---
Did I kook the orb of orahil? 
---
I went down the path of the infernal not realising it was for fire damage.. so I abandoned it and now I can’t go down the path of the fel hound for the shadow damage items
---
No one owes the server they rolled on anything.
---
I transferred here as well. Met a great group of people. I can second what the other guy said, it does die down some at night but still don’t have a hard time finding a group for anything. Faction balance seems great. I have had a blast leveling up.
---
Gnomes are the best designed race visually by far
---
Me and Rogue are in full Pre Bis + some MC pieces. If youre running with a resto druid you can propably get away with less gear.
---
I think there’s a potion for it, but I’m not sure.
---
ouch, go call your mom.
---
You should only tank if you want to imo. Not because your guild tells you to. But if you want then tell guild to help you gear. My GM hoarded all trash items to sell and put all that money on our main tank. Tank items are often BOE and hard to get (with a few exceptions) so if guild is expecting you to tank then you should tell them to help.
---
Every diremaul Boss has a chance to drop books.
---
Bro I had a dream today my mustache grew from my gums
---
Im up to 38 without seeing it on my rogue. 
---
In vanilla I got HoJ and Ironfoe first run.
---
+1 for f.lux - install that whether you play wow or not
---
Lot's of people get their mount at 40, lots don't as well. Depends on your professions, how you spend, how you play and if you grind for xp on mobs that also give gold.
---
What a ballsy comment your mom must think your a badass
---
Indendious? He told me I'm banned from all of his raid groups and banned me.  Somehow over the course of 4 hours his xp per hour went from 100k to 115k.  All I said was sorry man I'm 59 and you are 52 I'm not looking to carry a dungeon for you.  Banned
---
Could you think of any way of shortening this any further? It's a few characters too many. I know i don't really need the showtooltip modifier, but its annoying me to see the berserking tooltip without it. It has to prioritise mouseover &gt; target &gt; myself, with alt overriding any target to self heal, and shift downranking on all occasions.
---
\#showtooltip \[mod\]Flash Heal(Rank 1);Flash Heal
---

---

---
If a BoE drops, I think everyone should have an equal shot at getting the item as we will all benefit from it equally.
---
It's really strange to me that people consider wanting an even 20% chance of receiving an upgrade for everyone in your party is considered "greedy".
---
Stop feeling wrong or bad about it, just make it known the item is reserved. If they have a qualm about it, it’s up to them to decide if they would like to join/stay. Just make it explicit known at the beginning, before first pull.
---
I’m not sure there ARE any “pure Tank” cloaks; every pre-BiS list I’ve looked at lists the Baron’s cloak for tanks and DPS.
---
Will I have a harder time endgame wise getting into raids as a druid or a hunter? Hunter seem superior for end-game solo farming, but I'm curious as to whether I'll have issues raiding for tier gear.
---
Where do pvp builds come into this?
---
I'm a holy pally main spec. I'm geared to be a raid healadin. I'm also doing all this for the purpose of getting pvp gear. Do I roll on HoJ?
---
So an average of 13 hours a day?
---
How
---
Oh the grind for that tiger. I did it in Vanilla. Don’t know I will have the time this go around. I also did the Shat’tari sky guard or whatever they were called in TBC.
---
I don't think the lotus comparison works cuz I think lotus are undervalued at 50g currently
---
But yeah the pristine blacks will become more and.more in demand, the only thing is brd will always be farmable. It will def be farmed less and less as more people hit 60 and get full prebis
---
Meant to say damage + healing. And there is quite a bit available between dungeon drops and tailoring. SM for instance has hypnotic blade/orb of the forgotten seer as well as the mace from Cath.
---
The ones that say ‘layered.’
---
Similar Situation ; Got invited as dd then get "forced" to tank in ubrs offhand drops i roll need get it rogue flames me that I'm a ninja
---
I lost the ring to a prot pally, i dont feel bad for you
---
Most of the people running Princess are there for that ring, so trying to put it on reserve is pretty futile. I realized after one run that groups were going to have 3 people rolling every time which is why I just leveled elsewhere and bought one later.
---
Bonus points to your party for being objectively wrong, because it is absolutely a tank ring.
---
It drops in both
---
Did 18-20 hours a day for 2 weeks after launch. 😁😁
---
DOTA
---
As of this weekend it was just fine on my server
---
I don't want anything, I'm just confused as to why you actually get bothered by somebody being happy over an achievement that obviously matters to them. It seems something odd to be bothered by even if you don't openly get annoyed.
---
Uh.. just use a modifier? 
---
Like 
---
/cast SS [nomod]
---
/cast SnD [mod:shift]
---
This lets you use your key for ss and the modifer+same key for snd . You'll have to use your own brain cells tho.
---
I've noticed a trend: Undead and Orcs are the douches on Horde, Gnomes are the douches on Alliance.  Which makes 100% perfect sense since those races have the best pvp racials for the faction.
---
nts
---
Big imbalance. Far more horde. Makes it fun if you’re into world pvp but makes levelling a pain. Economy is decent. Enough players that alliance has a couple active raiding guilds and a couple pugs.
---
Patience and crying
---
I love you guys
---
So when a mage sheeps, or hunter range pulls, spam heals on them to draw the mob to you?
---
&gt;Ive lost Skullflame Shield to amage, and Forors compendium to a hunter.
---
No shit, those are BoE epics.  They aren't items, they're sacks of hundreds of gold that everyone can use equally.  Even if you win it and actually equip it all it means is you've decided to spend its value on the item itself.  It's literally no different than a rogue winning it, selling it, and buying a Krol Blade instead.
---
If you're referring to Hydrocane it allows underwater breathing.  Thanks though!
---
Level an alt! Farm! Play the AH! Level professions! World pvp! There is enough to do.
---
that's just spams /lfg .. you either reply with full sorry or just ghost them.. they will get the message and I doubt they will get offended, I got ghosted multiple times before, never cared.
---
You shouldn’t need to communicate that. The onus is not on you. The onus is on whoever is forming the group to clarify what loot is reserved.
---
Yes. Unless you're on a low pop server at like 3 am server time, you will be grouping with people and interacting with others to get things done. The social aspect in classic is very difficult to avoid
---
[removed]
---
\#NoChanges
---
You can solo probably ~80% of the non-dungeon content, maybe a bit more depending on class/skill/patience. However you can’t really do dungeons alone without building some kind of relationship with other players.
---
This is one aspect where classic and retail differ a lot - retail has a ton of changes to make content easier to solo, and the Dungeon Finder makes it possible to do most dungeons without any real communication.
---
Back in vanilla I *wished* content was easier to solo, but as those features got added and it became actually really easy to access all the content with minimal interaction, I found I missed being forced to interact with others.
---
Find a guild, join it, join in with the chat, ask for advice, go do dungeons with them. They won’t mind if you don’t know much, you have bad gear or it’s your first time.
---
If all that sounds horrible, you may prefer retail.
---
You arent getting it and at this point I dont think you will. The majority of the comments are saying how you should have communicated it better yet you continue to argue and try justify your miscommunication. Good luck with the rest of your Classic experience.
---
 thanks dude
---
All you need is 6% with human warriors, all you've ever wanted was to cap yellow hits.
---
Get used to the hordes of idiots you will be tanking for. Theyre all pro gamers but the 3 dps will all be targeting different mobs, priests that want to pull with MC, and the ultra common DPS WARRIOR who makes the group look for a tank for 30 minutes and wants to roll on all your gear.
---
I dropped WoW almost a year ago after playing since WotLK. A friend of mine let me try classic on her account that will be shutting down in a month and I LOVE IT! I'm hoping to find a guild or a group of people who feel the same. Thanks for your post.
---
[Blessed Qiraji War Axe](https://classicdb.ch/?item=21242) is the perfect example of this.  It is a Fury Warrior BiS weapon until Naxx is released.  Take away the Int on it and you have a 60 DPS 1h with 9 sta, 1% crit and 14 AP.
---
If you are horde I have the answer.  Also what class so I can help better
---
It’s fun man !
---
Hunters/baddies don't care, they see "mail" and they assume it's good for them. I doubt most of them even read the stats on the gear lol.
---
What level, and do you do any bosses?
---
Thanks for the extra info on why it is a good setup. I don't know much about shamans. I have heard this combo mentioned a few times, I'm going to try it out!
---
I've tried everything on reddit and on wow forums, still not working.
---
No you aren't a ninja at all. That rogue only got a chance at cape because you agreed to tank for him even though you MS as dps. If he doesn't like it, he can find another tank.
---
Ahhh yep you’re right my bad
---
Onyxia and MC don't require anything beyond basic consumables, and apart from maybe the main tank on Rag, shouldn't require a flask.  They both can be comfortably cleared by a raid in even non-BIS dungeon blues, as long as everyone is correctly specced, understands how to play their class in a raid, and the raid leader is able to explain the fights.
---
Rag is the only fight that legitimately should require consumable use from the entire raid (generally two greater fire protection potions per attempt plus class-specific consumables), but shouldn't require the entire raid to flask up.
---
Failure to kill Ony and proceed smoothly through MC to Rag is a personnel issue, not a gear/consumable issue.
---
Is it hard to get grps as a rogue?  I mean surely not much harder than any other dps right?
---
It might be harder while leveling due to the stupid spellcleave meta, but I don’t think it’s particularly hard at 60.
---
Today I got the Hallow’s End Pumpkin Treats. One made me larger and orange. So in cat form, I couldn’t fit through normal sized doors.
---
Definitely correct about OOMing, however for pulls there is chain lightning and lightning shield for multiple target aggro
---
I use AdiBags and it is such a convenient time saver! This is THE bag add-on if you want to pick up items and have them auto sort without you needing to do anything.
---
I had a high level self hunter steal echeyakee from me the other day, I tried to kill it before he could finish the tame but other lions killed me first :(
---
I cant imagine levelling an alt to 60 right now and having to do the same prebis grinds again. Fuck that shit

Damn, I was a hpal in mara the other day, got both the mp5 shield and the fist of stone (no stat mh, mana on hit). I got both in the end, but our warrior tank needed on the hammer. Like wtf?
---
I completely agree with this. The last line made me laugh though. "unreliable loot whores can fuck right off though." I used this system in vanilla through WoTL. It worked well for us. It was always MS before OS and everyone gets gear eventually. Even the low DKP do because the high DKP will pass on the things they dont need. 
---
It's all what you feel comfortable with though. If you don't like it, then find a guild that shares your same idea. Nothing says you have to stay in that guild.
---
Reroll. 
---
If you are not enjoying it you wont last.
---
Thanks for the well thought out answer appreciate it, I just might switch over soon might try to grab some more levels
---
Your guildmates are, sorry, being idiots. They're reading the "HOW TO LEVEL ROGUE TO 60" guides and assuming that's how it's done without any real understanding of playstyles and the simple fact there's more to the class than damage... not to mention *it's so much more fun*.
---
I've put more hours in to rogues, especially in vanilla, than the vast majority and can assure you that being able to sap and having cooldowns up all the time is *way* more use than spamming Adrenaline Rush and Blade Flurry. Not to mention it makes you feel more free to USE your CD's knowing you can prep and use them again in an emergency. 
---
[Here is a rough idea where I ended up by 60](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/025-32030520200501-0502520303001). I went full sub till prep, then got Remorseless Attacks (it's amazing for leveling), then down combat until BF, finished in Assassination then finished combat. I don't know if it's the most amazing spec of all time but it's a ton of fun, things die super fast, and you get a heap of utility.  It works great up to 60 and for every single instance *at* 60 - I out DPS'd everybody with it all the way without issue.
---
I only respecced combat daggers to head in to MC.. you absolutely don't need to before that and even then I only did it to help the raid, I could still have done great damage without the respec. Oh and if you wanna use daggers, do it. Swords has a technically higher DPS output.. but fun fact, everyone wants swords. Going daggers will often net you better DPS simply because you can actually get the best daggers with far less competition! Also fun fact: daggers are way cooler.
---
So yeah man, don't let anybody tell you not to play the way you are. I've been top DPS in guilds for every expansion I played, raid leader/guild leader/class leader and everything in between. Rogue is a super fun class, enjoy it :).
---
Yup. Back in wrath there was this very angry girl in our guild, I just chalked it up to being an edgy teenager. Ten years go by and we catch up by accident in classic, she's become as bitter and butthurt as they come, to the point where I just started refusing invites for her dungeon groups.
---
Youd level even faster if you didnt read the quest text except for when you get stuck on a quest
---
Best way to get word out about masterlooting ninja duo? I've got screenshots
---
Well... Why would voidwalker have a name that looks like "thot gang" if it was not female
---
Yeah people don’t fucking read the advert text a lot of the time.
---
I reserve dong for when people hit 60

You sure he isn’t assistant to the assistant to the regional manager?
---
Really? On my server it's flip flopped. Only essence of fire and Earth really costs anything on AH
---
Back in Vanilla, most of the people I played with or who offered their opinion in various chats all agreed that if you're in a PUG, expect that anyone might roll on that piece of loot you're after.  If you want the gd piece so bad, you form a guild group to farm it.
---
Mostly tanking any dungeon my guild wants. Thats it.
---
I guess ill find out at 60 but yes for me it's been very hard to find groups, talking 1-2 hours on average for me to get one even when using the LFGshout addon. Ill even whisper people that are making groups give them my class and level.
---
they give me a reply like oh your too low level meanwhile im level 44 trying to do a 42-46 lvl dungeon or we already have a rouge/ we want aoe. Etc etc.
---
Hunter here. The staff can definitely drop without doing a full tribute run. I’ve gotten it multiple times.
---
Today I got the alpha strike quest in Feralas and then logged out for a bit. I forgot it had an hour timer. I logged in, went to start it, got annoyed at having the density and running mobs and finally after killing ten of them realized this is too many. I opened my log to see if I completed it without realizing it and saw 'Failed'.
---
-_-
---
You couldn't when i posted
---
I'm not bothered - I'm genuinely confused as to how someone could ever be bothered by such things. As a fellow grumpy old man I actually love seeing people get excited by things that are droll and boring to me.
---
I'm a rogue at 60 as someone who had over 100 days played at 60 on my rogue in vanilla. Not much *really* excites me like it did back then, but it's super cool to see others getting to experience the joy I did so long ago.
---
Just me I guess.
---
It's really not that hard to reply with 'full now ty' to the extra 5 or so people that message you.. nice and polite too
---
Just to make sure, you are saving the file after making changes rather than just closing it out, right?
---
To be fair, once you dot a rogue they are dead so might as well run
---
Ive done it with coc, nova, and flamestrike too
---
But if someone is having trouble with basic blizzard grinding, I'm not gonns recommend that to them
---
I got the Time-Lost Proto Drake in WotLK, I was so damn proud of that thing.
---
Confirmed this works thanks
---
The axe can drop without doing a full tribute run. 
---
There is a famous hunter streamer named Ahmpy that got it last night (maybe the night before) on one of his solo runs.
---
Only 2k gold haha
---
Man that’s sad. I feel bad for this guy. Imagine how bad his real life situation is, that even in a game designed to escape and corporate with others that you bring that kind of anger.
---
Not being a native speaker is somehow an excuse for bad grammar?
---
Most of the native English speakers I know have fucking terrible grammar.  The best tend to be non-native.
---
I wish. Closer to 7-800 on my server.
---
The situation in you're in with this guild is that the job you want is already taken - and they've made it clear it's not a job you'll ever have. The sooner you leave, the happier you'll be long-term.
---
Simply vendoring everything from those dungeons should’ve given you enough for an epic mount. Hell, people hit 60 with more than 200g in their pockets just from questing.
---
RFD was the worst one for my so far it took multiple days to find a group for it, while looking every couple hours. AT LEVEL 43
---
No joke i couldnt get a group for RFD at lvl 43. Eventually I manage to get my guild to run it with me.
---
Don't forget to get your moles mapped regularly if you are that serious about tanning.

Classic is the  first time I have ever played wow and i picked up full protection warrio. It is hard leveling, but I love dungeons and when I get to set a good pace it feels amazing. Another plus is I never have to wait for group. And shadow priest is not dps is not a thing so please stop trying to convince me. So go tanking and praise good healers. And one last thing, know your agro kids ;-)
---
How are you skipping the adds?
---
I have easily spent over 800g on stuff I don't need. I'm just not good at saving.
---
You know that you are allowed to say retard
---
you can right click their name to report... I do it every time
---
Thanks to Reddit, nobody passes on BOE anymore. I get that you can sell it and get a BOE that suits you, but that’s a slippery slope. It should always be a need/greed situation and basically isn’t anymore because of a bunch of salty redditors who can’t be happy for someone else. 
---
The mail gloves that increase wep specialization dropped in my group and the fucking healer got it because of this dumb new rule people are adopting. Like it’s literally in the name of the rolls, nerd or greed. And yes, I’m salty.
---
4-7? It took me 7-10 (sometimes more) every time, and I wasn’t even really dragging my feet. I think 59-60 was the shortest, done all in one good strat live spam group.
---
I would reverse your list for me
---
I suppose it was my own fault but I was selling a devilsaur set for 210g. A 52 rogue says he’ll buy, but he only has 180g atm. He offered to buy the gloves now, pants later. So, I sold him the gloves at a discounted 70g. Says he’ll buy the pants tomorrow when he has the gold. COD the pants for the other 140g.
---
Three days  later he finally sends a message back saying he bought the pants from someone else, and won’t be buying the pants now.
---
It’s pure salty to blame “retail players” or “young kids” for this ninja looting bs. When I played in early Vanilla days, ninja was not common simply because most people were ignorant about “Pre raid BIS”, “drop list”, or “stats priority”, etc. Basically people did not even notice they were ninja-looting or needing someone else’s BiS.
---
 A good team composition can easily avoid this, and I think most retail players are more aware of it. Friends I dung with who also play retail are very knowledgeable about BIS, gear stats and they always build a good team compo that maximize the profits for everyone in each dung run.
---
Understood, I will begin to save runecloth.
---
That would be deathcharger's reigns from baron rivendare, an unrealistic goal but it would be nice to have.
---
This guy doesnt get it
---
He thinks just because you do one quest with someone or a dungeon youre suddenly best friends and pals

Thank you!

The phrase “God Wills It” wasn’t “popularized” by the crusades. It has been part of the Catholic Church long before the crusades. It was one of many battle cries they had. God Wills It is a hugely popular phrase that Muslims used then and use today and many more old school Catholics who still take Latin Mass hear it every Mass. it’s hugely ignorant to boil it down to just a racist slogan. And if you want to play good guys vs bad guys during the time period of the crusades you’re even more ignorant of history. 
---
If a guild wants that to be their name regardless of the reason it’s ridiculous to call them white supremacists when you don’t know the reason they chose it. I probably wouldn’t join a guild with that name but it’s ridiculous to call them white supremacists. 
---
Just because some asshole uses some phrase doesn’t change its meaning and the “there are plenty of alternatives” is entirely irrelevant. Why are you giving these shitty people so much power? You’re acting puritanical which is why I said sarcastically you must be a fun person.
---
are you combat daggers or seal fate? and yes keep slice n dice up even with daggers
---
No my point is this game is easy if people are skilled. People complaining about gear etc just need to practice more.  There is nothing in phase 1 that can't be fury tanked in greens and blues.
---
Hey! I’ve already got that one installed, thanks!
---
Thanks, but TSM is not really what I'm looking for in this case, though your answer is not wrong.
---
It depends. On dps that unload before you can build rage, you're better off mauling targets before you swipe. Especially with just a couple big mobs. 
---
It's more important to get mobs hitting you as early as possible, and each maul hit almost guarantees it'll hit you for a while unless it's skull, who you can always taunt.
---
Of course if it's a pack of 5 or more mobs then you don't really have a choice. Hots, demo, swipe spam all you can really do.
---
Can get fancy with barkskin - war stomp - half casted hurricane before switching to bear, but it's mana intensive and your heals can't be sleeping
---
To a brand new player it’s instinctive to back up. It’s what you do on real life when you’re up against something big and tough that wants to eat your face. It’s also a (naive) way to buy more time before the mob starts to force your skull and ground to be *very* good friends. 
---
I managed to get one of my friends to pick it up and we ran a few dungeons together. Lost aggro on a mob and he started backing up. Told him in discord to run towards me. He’s never ran away from me since. Took three seconds to fix.
---
I'm a rogue and I'd be pissed. Don't think you are a ninja but a tank needing on DPS gear needs to say they are needing on DPS gear when they join the party as a tank. The cape is MUCH better on a rogue than it is for a tank warrior but yeah still. If I was that rogue and I knew you were gonna need on DPS gear I'd leave lmao
---
...and then you meet the mythical Boomkin!
---
It's so much better than Bagnon.
---
Everyone runs it this way.  Feral doesn't matter.
---
Suspicious of what ? I wasn’t trying to justify anything I was just sharing my loot history of being one of the unlucky players.
---
Big up Firemaw horde!
---
Do you not have Turanjo or something? What is going on, is that normal?
---
Hardcore guilds will have very few of the classes you listed, because they clear Molten Core (current raid content) under an hour. 
---
Though, if you go in random groups you can probably get invited anyways since one of the big challenge is getting 40 people that can play for 3 consecutive hours and tjat haven't already done it that week
---
“Wait until you get the Dal’s” I killed rend 31 times and never even SAW the mainhand, ONCE
---
Vendor price for bop items doesn’t vary from player to player. Why you think people solo 5 mans for gold farm lol
---
I got it on my 50th run, friends have had it on everything from their 1st to their 97th run (ouch). Hang in there!
---
legend
---
No cause I ran Sunken Temple with the same Hpally from 53 to 55
---
I tanked every dungeon in the game. Cause I wanted the experience and do all the quest
---
Including WC and SFK cause I know paladins need help with their Weapon Quest
---
You all call me antisocial and shit but I would go out of my way and do more for ANY of you than you would for me. Which is exactly why I dont see any reason to keep random people on my friends list.
---
When I see other alliance players getting ganked by 5 horde I intervine knowing I will die. Idc if theyre Skulls or not.
---
Just me that it doesn’t show anything with “/fl s”?
---
I am very much ok with anybody who would ignore me. Don’t want to have do deal with that in an instance ;).
---
If you make a /petmoveto macro in classic, it'll still bring up the targetting reticle from the legion client. It whist doesn't do anything lol.
---
Nope. Ive tanked every dungeon and More than happy to go out of my way to help people who ask.
---
Cant say the same thing for any of you though.
---
I'm not a dagger rogue, but for any pve I'm like 99% certain that you keep snd up. +5 dmg to mainhand, crusader offhand. Might experiment using ss on trash if necessary? Idk. I'm about to start learning about combat daggers more because our guild has gotten 4 perditions and zero viskag/brutality. All the tanks have perditions and our one dagger rogue does too. I can't imagine dalrends can out dps perditions + distracting/cht/gutgore with the massive mh dps increase.
---
So you have a problem with rolling on gear ? If you want a 100% chance of getting a piece of gear advertise that you are reserving a piece of gear. I’m not a tank I’m a DPS. Rogues are sub tier raid DPS behind fury so that logic is wrong.
---
Not really
---
I solo leveled in 06 too. As a Night Elf warrior
---
It's attack power and melee hit rating.

Mobs can't resist FD if you're not in los, fyi

My position is simply if you let the group know, and they are fine with it, then it’s fine. It’s all about communication
---
Never forget Hasslehoof
---
I've got one gem for the ubrs key already luckily Scholo I've had no luck getting into
---
If its genuine. And not just because Im a level 60 tank.
---
The only class that can role for two plspecs in all the dungeons is a tank. I have no clue why there so privlaged cause it would be nice as a healer to roll in crap like that or else I would be called a ninja too. 
---
My exp in classic so far is the tank taking anything that is even close to something relevant for either spec of his. 
---
You “rolled cause I wouldn’t figure I would win” 
---
Sounds like the mage who accidentally rolled on your sword. 
---
I honestly don’t mind too much as long as it’s not totally out of line. If it’s just gold for me I don’t mind giving it to someone who will eventually use it. Def not a ninja, but I do always ask if it’s not specifically the gear for the role I’m playing BEFORE.
---
For real though. I crazy how many people think because I’m tanking, DPS is my offspec even though I’m fury
---
Hello there fellow, Priest! DM:E lashers are OK gold but as you’re learning not great XP. With your current build I’d recommend dungeons or farming elites in burning steppes. Get to 54 and run some BRD. As for other places to AOE farm we can’t do ZF as the mobs are slightly too tanky. There are some places in BRD you can aoe farm but you’ll need the key and more HP than with lashers. I’ve been doing the lashers farm and like you- was waiting 3 mins between pulls. I bought 20 greater mana pots and now alternate inner focus / PI / mana potion to run through packs the moment I’m full mana; never using all 3 on one pack 
---
I was surprised at how good this mana stack build is for soloing elites in the world and I mostly play shadow. Sticking with PI now since it’s fun to get added to people’s friends list after they get their biggest crits with you as a healer
---
24 days played here.
---
I just do both with hotw.
---
Really cool to be able to do that
---
Does posting the website really add to the point of this post? OP did the right thing.
---
Moosemanden, Csoki.. haha! Good to see familiar faces! Gz guys!
---
They are called meeting stones. They work as intended.
---
Summoning stones were added in TBC
---
A little over 14 played just got 60 a few days ago
---
Takes seconds to replace, takes 20 minutes for him to arrive to your instance
---
I thought it still was 30 days.
---
Or the current President of the US.
---
Yep.
---
a temporary upgrade for you means less than 4g for others.
---
No one I know IRL plays wow.
---
And its been like that since I started playing wow. I can never meet people who play the same video games as me or like the same video games as me.
---
Nah I told my GM I'd do either, it's just I get driven up the wall tanking for pugs who ignore marks and go full bore before you even get a hit in. That and even with the numbers I don't think my GM believes me on the importance of edgemasters/ancient corehound gloves
---
Well, I have about 40 gold and just dinged 36 this morning. No mount for me at 40.
---
Did they change it from 30 days?  I thought items stayed in your mail for up to 30 days.
---
I have a grey kodo that runs silently. If I turn on walk it has footsteps, though. I verified with a guildy they don't hear it either unless I jump or walk.
---
On my server I see advertisements in trade and global all the time for MC and Ony pugs
---
Why though ?
---
None of the grey items I loot show up in the log, therefore not adding to my total gold farmed. just wanted to let you know
---
unless its a hunter that doesn't have ammo for it rn
---
Ran into an orc hunter named Dickcheney on Bloodsail Buccaneers a few weeks ago. Actually did a quest with him, nice guy.
---
So youre a clit.
---
That wont vibe well in the guild
---
Appreciate the offer but not required.  I'll get it in time.
---
I use this one lol
---
Yeah there's loads of pugs already, at least on the not so dead servers,  but I think pretty much every server has at least one pug atm.

Its like 1-3 shot every boss cept Rag and profit.

Lol I hope you mean clique and yeah, we are originally from a massive guild that broke into two so we are starting to be more social lol
---
When living in the past is living in the future. Epic work, OP.
---
I’ve been helping guildies, and farming mad consumes.
---
Came here to say that too 😂
---
You nailed it on the head.
---
Gotta love classic wow scenic routes. What’s the addon that says the flight time?
---
Many classes do strong focused damage. As a warlock I can do some AoE damage but I lack the AoE CC which you need to do it safely. Mages are unique in that aspect.
---
It's up to you, really. Your instances will go faster if you're AoEing packs, but it's a little more work for your tank to keep all of the mobs off you. If that pace makes it too chaotic, you can always go back to single target frostbolts and do it slow and steady.
---
&gt;Naxx was a pretty big increase in difficulty compared to anything Blizz had done before, especially on the later bosses. That's why I'm saying it was difficult for the time it was released. 
---
That's because the other raids were easy, not because naxx was hard.
---
&gt;And no offense but your guild clearing the easier bosses, maybe during the TBC pre patch even is no indication on how difficult the raid was.
---
It want during the TBC pre patch, so no need to assume. My guild stopped raiding once the prepatch hit. Loatheb and thaddius are the easier bosses? You seem fond of shifting the goalposts.
---
&gt;But you can't just judge a raid's difficulty in retrospect, the same as you shouldn't judge it through nostalgia goggles.
---
That's why i said it wasnt hard either way. You are the one wearing nostalgia goggles.
---
&gt;Going back to the Sprinter example I gave earlier: Running 100m in less than 10 seconds was mind blowing in the 1970's, 
---
Your sprinter example would be more accurate if someone ran 100m in 20s+ in the 70's. That's how loosely naxx was tuned.
---
This is exactly the reason why lol. It allows Asian gamers to play one handed while smoking a cig with other. I remember playing CS at a pc bang in Seoul back in the summer of 2000 and always ended up smelling like an ashtray at the end of even a short gaming session.
---
Can you tell me how to get the Halloween Wand?
---
What are some of the best places for a 60 mage to farm gold? ZF?
---
I am similar. Always have 2 or 3 going pretty steady. Actually doing better in Classic than I did in vanilla and focusing a bit more, but I just like the change of pace.
---
This won't work in the modern macro engine because Berserking triggers the GCD so if it's on CD the whole macro fails.

It’s all they have, they know it’s an action that might get to some people and it’s low effort and fast to do.

Hi, I just started playing WoW Classic last week; longtime veteran of WoW but retired around Legion.  I now play Krewe, currently a Level 24 Hunter.
---
I am looking for a guild of medium-to-large size with a substantial member base that is still leveling.  I am a dad with a full-time job and would like to play with folks of a similar cut, or at least those who are understanding of the limitations that comes with.  The ideal guild would be "serious casual."
---
Looking forward to hearing from you!
---
What? I definitely meant weird in the endearing way
---
Pretty much all the guides are just people copy pasting raid tanking bis lists. Dont worry about defense for dungeons. Detahbone is good if you want it, but I prefer 6pc lightforge.
---
20/31/0 and 25/26/0 are both strong reckoning based builds that you can raid heal and dungy tank from comfortably. Really tho, you can just slap on RF and use any build with consecrate to be a passable tank. Even ret builds work fine. Missing imp righteous fury is gonna make some situations a bit rought, but it won't make content undoable.
---
Just avoid the cookie cutter 11/31/9, that goes hand in hand with the cookie cutter bis list, unless all you want to do is tank.
---
Here's a gear list for quick reference:

You're just a rotten shitbag that likes making people feel worse when theyre already down.

The term 'deus vult' was 100% popularized solely as a battlecry during sieges that killed hordes of innocent people. It has nothing to do with peaceful religious endeavours, whatsoever. You taking the 'literal meaning' of it is just a bad play at a semantics game, its like saying 'wpww 1488' has no further meaning but we all know in what context it is used.
---
Idiots use it today because of its historical bearing, aka kill everything that is non-christian in 'our lands' (or in todays sentiment anything that isnt white). They didnt steal it and make it have a different meaning like you're trying to make it be.
---
History revisionism isnt gonna work for ya. This term was specifically used in 1095 en masse (first crusades), so saying it was used in any collective effort long before that is complete nonsense.
---
Anyways, back to the point, if your guild is named that you're either an ignorant idiot or a extremist deranged racist. One of two, literally no other possibility.

---
Discord-Nothackingk#1956
---
No not at all.
---
I dont like trolling unless its funny for everyone.
---
what rep grind would you recommend starting with?
---
This is why I never join dps built groups. They are always stacked by the leader so that specific dps player does not have loot competition. This is your privilege as tank and you should exercise it. Build your own groups as tank and never bring any dps wars, rogues, or hunters. Druids are okay because they don't exist.
---
Time to level a druid!
---
Wow there’s at least 20 people!
---
I did a 2 DAY grind Sunken Temple Grind with the same Hpally.
---
What of it?
---
What do you mean? Now you can play the game.
---
I don’t think it’s gonna be able to track rainfall any better....
---
Can you post the log?
---
Booty bay isn’t very minimalisitc. It’s one of the few original towns in all of azeroth and I could totaly see the same way of boardswalks topped on eachother work for How OP imagens Gadgetztan.
---
I ran it 7 times and the ring dropped 6/7 of them! 
---
...I also lost the roll all 6 times.
---
Then I won it on run number 30th on my 8th time rolling
---
Yup looks like me IRL. Well except the sexy ass beard.
---
I feel like if I was a badass warrior in Azeroth Id have a sexy beard.
---
I love it when shit like that happens.
---
Dwarf anything seems to play by if it is red it is dead rules.
---
I remember realizing I was good at healing because people I didn’t even remember grouping with started vouching for me. It’s a good feeling.
---
Aside from the use of the word "literal", I agree.
---
Yes it’s very easy to pug Classic raids. The raids are very noob friendly and you don’t even need much gear. Most MC pugs take people who are level 58.
---
&gt; Warriors have the most gear options
---
For fury that only true for dungeons, the raid drops are pretty abysmal(essentially true for all hybrids). Thats why you'll see warrirors spaming dungeons since they'll keep those pieces well into BWL.
---
You think felhunter is bad but you maxed First Aid? Interesting warlock ;)
---
Thats cool dude. I had something simmilar just yesterday so i get your feeling:
---
I play rogue and i spent a lot of time in dungeons , yesterday i wanted to buy some arcanite cd and when i asked one guy he replied that for me it costs nothing, it was a pleasure, i still gave him some gold but i didnt think that me as a rogue would gain a good reputation because im friendly but at the same time if i disagree with something i always make my point clear and loudly and some people dont like it.

The super fast super leet specialty blitz groups and aoe groups always wipe in my experiencr. The regular joe shmoe groups seem to mostly clear ok. Just play the game the way it was meant imo.
---
naw  cause im not an undead warrior
---
These posts were funny the first few times but at this rate we're going to have them forever
---
Are you 60? Do you have epic mount?
---
I picked warrior because i love tanking. I forgot that warrior are boring as hell to play. So i rerolled rouge. 
---
Rouge has been alot of fun 10000000% regret not rolling it to begin with.
---
Wow stop the press people on the internet were wrong
---
I figuratively agree.
---
You spam backstab and keep up snd
---
I dare you to find 20 ppl on retail.
---
Next step is to post about it on reddit.

You're right on schedule.

Uh huh

Go solo level a warrior to 60 and come back to me. And tell me how you feel after.

[This addon could be a possible standalone solution for those interested, was released 3 days ago](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/chat-observer)
---
I dunno, I like to get a mob or two away from leveling, then pull like 10 mobs. That way after I've dotted everything up and am close to dying, I get the new level LoH/innervate and feel even more godly as I work down the rest of the stuff I pulled. Only backfired once lol
---
👋
---
Will there be localizations, seems only work in en clients.
---
...are you saying these are things people asked for?
---
dual spec ruined class identity, flying mounts ruined wpvp, server transfers killed community, lfd/lfr well I shouldn't even have to say anything about
---
achievements,stones and haircuts are all minor qol changes
---
the only argument you could make is that dual spec allowed you to play more of your class and experience more of the game.
---
Nice job, first aid is a lot easier than cooking and fishing, too!
---
Hope you’re enjoying the game!!
---
Ele pvp is very cheesy
---
What addon is this guy using to make the damage, crit, and experience text this font? https://imgur.com/a/JiB3Q6Y/
---
Ideally you want to give it to the MT first for the amazing threat it generates.
---
When your MT's have a Thunderfury, it can go to pretty much any other class that can use it.
---
You didn't roll on the bis piece, seems fine to me
---
This is because, at least from what I've seen in retail, you can easily skip mobs in retail and it won't be an issue.
---
Why do you need this...
---
You got a point. 
---
I can get too negative about retail at times and appreciate the correction.
---
.........
---
Just looking at leveling, playing classic versus retail does make me wonder about the benefits of a streamlined leveling system and a world that helps players avoid bad and/or frustrating experiences. 
---
On paper the experience in retail should be much better, but it never felt alive to me. It might be nostalgia, but maybe the bad/frustrating experiences are necessary to make the experience memorable. 
---
IDK, it could just be nostalgia.

Had the worst group last night.  All three dps did great damage.  Too bad I couldn't even swing my weapon at the first mob before blade fury was active on the rogue and the warrior was mashing whirlwind.
---
See that mob over there with the big skull on it's head?  Why is it still standing above three of it's buddies?
---
Pretty sure it is, unless it stays longer for alts. Which I'm pretty sure is not a thing.
---
I got lots of post with between 20 and 30 days remaining on my bank char and my main (to save bank space). All from expired auctions, won auctions and and mailing between my own chars. So if you ask me, it's certainly 30 and not 3 days.
---
Thank you! I couldn't remember this guy's name but his guides are excellent
---
They didn’t do anything. They didn’t create that meta, players did.
---
You can drop run with a tank for good gold, especially if you’re a RShammy (Any healer works but RShammy has things that make it easier)
---
I got 6 days. Currently level 41 on a warrior.
---
Holy pretention batman
---
Do you like pvp? If so you prepare for phase 2.
---
If not then yeah level an alt.
---
you can make money farming satyrs since you need their runes to raid. otherwise it depends on your class really, im farming lashers as a priest.
---
How'd it go tanking the groups with multiple brutes?
---
If you join the LFG and LookingForGroup chats, it's super easy. Takes usually about 20 min for DPS in most level ranges.

Yea the removing of sheeps is nice, and silence is always nice - but i feel the succy does more for me. I can use her to interrupt - CC a 2nd player - or time it with my casts to keep someone seduced nearly 100% since it only takes 2-3 hard casts to kill someone right now.

Ouch, I ran 70+ without seeing 1 drop. Luckily though I got T1 chest in first MC run, so never again

What ever helps you sleep at night if you believe this hahahaha
---
Alot of it depended on reputation too. If you were known for  ot being able to raid they generally wouldn't even reply to you I got asked to join guild raids in dungeon pugs a couple of times.
---
Everyone who says that to me on the realm gets a 15 silver reward.
---
Kill
---
30 days played.. girlfriend..?
---
Sounds impressive since "Dismiss Pet" has a range of 10 yards.
---
That's so dirty. But I would do the same
---
if anyones opinion on killing the enemy faction is anything but it's okay then they rolled on the wrong server type.
---
I play a hunter.... and i hate that hunter who took your hoj.
---
May his pet run away and may he never get a Rhokdelar.   Ever.
---
My opinion is... having a negative opinion of ganking of any kind but also wanting to play on pvp server is a contradiction. but not wanting to get too heavy, having contradictory opinions is quite normal for the average person in all aspects of their life.. work, love, politics, religion, culture..
---
But now they needed a tank *and* a healer
---
That's just literally a lie lol
---
55g for black lotus?! Whoa
---
Rogue is just salty but you're also a douche for thinking just because you ran an instance a certain amount of times that you are more entitled than others.
---
Retail player thinking a server is dead if they cant group for a quest or dungeon in 60s or less! Lol what a joke.
---
Classic is based on BFA core so it would have actually been much more work to revert back to the old (terrible) raid UI than stick with the current one.
---
I'm glad they stuck with the current one though.  It doesn't make any difference to gameplay, community, spirit or anything really.  I haven't read a single complaint about keeping the modern raid UI.
---
So it's all the more perplexing why they chose to make shamans pink again... to go back to having two classes on opposite factions with the same class color is weird and confusing as hell.  Even more so if they make TBC servers... when shamans will be back to being blue again.. just after we've all got used to them being pink!
---
I think pvp would be pretty good, is mage a good class for pvp?
---
That quest isnt currently in classic and wont be there till phase 4 or 5 i think.
---
To answer your question though, get the staff for the looks and unique model or the trinket for the utility, whichever you value more.
---
Loot Councils are 95% of the time, a complete joke. There are many other ways to reward members who contribute more than others. The DKP system is literally a tool for tracking contribution to Raids and is completely transparent to all, not a "'well, we feel this guy deserved it more' Council of power trippers"
---
warriors and pvp, nice joke, ofc you can pvp as warriow with pocket healer tho
---
I know it’s tough man. If it makes you feel any better not all of us rogues are like this. I personally would gear all my warrior boys to the teeth before myself! Can you find a different guild with the same progression?
---
Pretty much
---
My server horde outnumber alliance as well so I feel your pain.
---
Feralas was pretty good for me in my 40's. Horde don't really bother to come to island on left so you can grind mobs there in peace.
---
My 40's were mostly Feralas, Hinterlands and Tanaris. I never did ZF but did Ulda twice and mara once.
---
I'm 51 now and struggling Fellwood, azshara and searing gorge are all full of horde who won't let me do any quests - especially fellwood that zone is giving me STV like flashbacks with how hard it is to do quests feels like constant ganks.
---
Going to try Ungoro and Blasted lands tonight hopefully those zones are more peaceful.
---
Won't someone think of the fish?

I wish I could give you all my karma.
---
someone in my guild has an addon that does it
---
DING!!!!!! I have reached level 37!!!!
---
Nice. Cant wait to try it out
---
That is about the only time i dont kill.... Fishing is about forgetting your problems - not watching your back. 
---
Other than that - idgaf! One of us is dying
---
Yeah but that doesn't mean hordies wanna see shamans as pink names in their chats.
---
Except its lbrs
---
If you're hurting for food don't feed them at yellow. When they're at green they will steadily decrease back to yellow. It's not worth trying to fight that constantly if you're limited on food which happens at times.
---
Best I can do is 3g
---
this, the same stun with less dmg, and this dmg difference would never win you the fight.
---
Red range is also built into Bartender which is really nice.  Saves having to keep two addons up to date.
---
Flasks for Mc and Ony? Get out of that guild

Dustbelcher ogres in the badlands are a very efficient XP / hour spot at 39-42. Much more XP than you would get at stranglethorn with constantly the other faction killing you (and long corpse runs). Farmed there for around ~30k XP per hour as lock.
---
edit: it's usually deserted as well. Sometimes some people come running through looking for a quest mob that is patrolling everywhere through badlands.
---
Haven’t touched retail in months, anything else you wanna get upset about little guy
---
Well if its a pvp server Id rather gank someone willing to fight back than just fishing ya know?
---
Oh snap! You guys from Incendius-US EST? Names seem super familiar. Palehorn &lt;Here We Go Again&gt;
---
I think this just applies to casters/mana users. At least I know this isn’t the case for rogues
---
Just tell them you need ranged dps
---
Uh I would wait until you have a consistent run before planting the sword
---
Nah man this isn't very reliable. Downed ony tonight. Probably 10 deaths before a random warrior finally got aggro. Fight is all fucked up.
---
I literally just upvoted this
---
Wow one post about one server is totally legitimate evidence that most servers dead! What a joke lol
---
Need the phat loot 4 da big numbers
---
i thought i was responding to a comment about scarlet cath
---
You're right, I concede. My memehancement shaman likes the dungarees.
---
How do you know it is 5k? Are you neo?
---
1KG easy
---
When you want something that’s not strictly for your class, I always just say at the start I’m looking for it. For example if I heal in a dungeon on Druid i might say I want leather for feral instead of cloth or something. 
---
If what you say is true then you are not a ninja obviously, you need the cape, you’re gonna use it.
---
RemindMe! 2 hours
---
20 a gram are you serious?!?!
---
Hahaha you win
---
If/when TBC Classic comes out, I'm gonna be all over that.  Dual wield, bloodlust, totemic call, water shield, earth shield, totemic call, earth and fire elementals, totemic call.  So much great stuff for shamans in TBC.
---
But for what price?
---
You just have to be in the lave close to the window
---
The game has been out for two months, almost everyone I've talked to has not made their twinks unless they don't have a job/life.
---
but thats exactly why addons exist - cos everyone has their own idea of what makes a good UI.  blizz could spend all their time on a new UI and many people would still hate it to death.  much better for addons to offer a choice of UI, it makes the game personal to the player which all helps with the whole own your character thing... which is all great for wow.
---
Dude
---
Farm farm farm. Or go out and world pvp.
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Encrusted_Tail_Fins shimmering flats!

If it is an upgrade to your gear, I see no problem on rolling need. That rogue was just salty.
---
Tell everyone about your amazing accomplishments!  Take out an add in the paper, don’t stop at Reddit.  The world must know that YOU are the BEST!  Accept nothing less.

No one said most servers are dead, a lot of the newer ones they opened are

Mooncloth CD
---
Hey that’s the name of my voidwalker in retail!! That’s so cool 🤩
---
I was just making a lighthearted joke, don’t loose sleep over it.
---
We got 3 HOJs in 5 runs as stealth group after I ran Arena/Anger nearly 40 times without seeing it. RNGesus giveth and taketh.
---
Absolutely will be. I had on every single private server
---
One time I got tricked because I read the quest. Someone in Booty Bay wants Singing Blue Crystals from the basilisks Crystalvein Mine but can't get them because Venture Co has moved in...
---
So of course the quest is to sneak past the Venture Co and start farming the basillisks or maybe even go mining in the Mine itself (a huge cave and area with tons of mobs), right?
---
Of course not, you're supposed to get the crystals from the Venture Co themselves, tucked into a tiny hillside around the corner with barely enough spawns for 3 people, let alone all of STV.
---
To be fair, it does specify this in the quest, but it's easy to assume otherwise on a skim read.
---
Wut
---
Anecdotal. My leveling guild on Westfall has a bunch of toons levels 23-38 with last online times of 3 weeks.  Also anecdotal, but not unusual. 
---
A few realm are going to survive just fine. The rest are dead already and will merge.
---
I fish and dont expect not to be attacted, but like it when not. But always on ready.
---
There seems to be an unspoken code of honor in which people seem to let anglers do their thing. There are some that don’t care and attack anyway, but the majority will just run past them.
---
Shhh! They'll hear you!
---
WoW character motivations and all succeeding events that take place as a result of those motivations are summed up by;
---
"He's angry about things"
---
or
---
"He's gone crazy!"
---
BRS? Crazy Dad.
---
Ragnaros/BRD? Angry dwarves.
---
Onyxia? Crazy Dad.
---
C'thun? OG Crazy.
---
ZG? Angry Trolls.
---
Naxxaramas? Crazy guy doing crazy things by proxy.
---
Sunwell? Crazy Elves.
---
I mean fuck this is true for most instances pre-60 too, except for maybe Stockades.
---
Farm pre-bis imo. Especially if you are a tank. Groups are always needing tanks and would stop down time quite a bit. 
---
I preferred LBRS at your level since it gave lots of exp, had good loot and there was tons of quests for it. Plus you can get started on your ony attunement for some extra exp.
---
It’s certainly possible
---
It's okay. Desolace might be better than Ganklethorn Vale  on PVP servers since Alliance has little reason to quest there and Mara is a bit out of the way. I would not do the entire zone though; at least not the Centaur quests.
---
Some people just like to shit on people with different opinions s🤷🏻‍♂️
---
That rogue is an idiot
---
I think it adds a lot of flavor to the game. Pun intended. I didn't bother much with first aid, but I'll get to it, I've heard the quest is very easy.  I'm enjoying it so, so, so very much.
---
Lol just look how they portrayed gadgetzan in Hs when it was that expansion (mean streets of gadgetzan).. there was a comment on 1 of the videos that said “meanwhile the real gadgetzan is a small town in the desert” lol.. my guess is a lot of the higher level zones are unfinished
---
Fishing!
---
That doesn't change anything. Classic is legit ez mode in terms of "content". Boss fights in OSRS actually have unique mechanics that take some time to learn. In Classic you just slam your face on the keyboard and do damage. There is no thinking involved, not to mention the lack of content. Sure more will come with each phase but it isn't much. OSRS is the better game and it takes much longer to accomplish everything. Once you hit max level in Classic(10-12 days played lol) you just grind the same instances over and over until you're full on BiS equipment. What happens after that? Rep grinds to tide you over until the next phase? Tons of fun amirite? 
---
Classic is easy and that's okay, but to make it out to be some non mind numbing shit because you have to use WASD is hilarious. You ever tried to get the maximum amount of xp/hour on fishing/mining/etc? Do you tick manipulate? No of course you don't because that would require brain power, something most players don't want to use while playing a clicking game from 2000. Nothing wrong with that of course but OSRS is far more mentally taxing than Classic and it shouldn't even be a discussion, it's that obvious.
---
I am guilty asf. I will have some amazing groups where we can skip hella packs and clear the dungeon fast, and then I try it with the next group and all hell breaks loose.
---
Well in this scenario,  he didnt "need" it.  
---
He wanted it for a 6 piece set that is inferior to bis items ... which is why its not bis.
---
Hahahahahaha that was almost as funny as the first guy that said it
---
I believe that, typically, unless a guild is doing Gbid for items, raiding is almost always a net-loss in gold for a guild.
---
umm?
---
Speed runners are the Chads of Classic WoW... Sometimes cool, mostly dickheads.
---
If you wanna do that it's your choice but I consider it bad etiquette.. As a priest it really pisses me off when our warrior party leader doesnt want loot competition but goes and recruits nothing but cloth wearing casters. 
---
Happened to me the other night. It's me, a priest, a warrior tank and his shadow priest guildmate. I realize ill have to compete with the shadow priest for drops, but that's part of the game... So we are looking for more memebers and my friend whose a warrior wants to join as dps, the party leader says NO, because he doesn't want competition if Ironfoe drops. I say in chat that I get it but it's part of the game, he ignores me. A few minutes pass and he invites a mage, then moments later he invites a Warlock.
---
A warrior and 4 casters. So we have to all compete for drops and he gets everything he wants. Fuck that. I don't care if tanks are in demand, rolling for loot is part of the game. Have some self awareness.
---
If I'm trying to fish pools and I see an alliance player taking them I will 100% kill them, just like any node.
---
You jump down and sneak through the pathing trees on diremaul east. You can kill 3 bosses for vendor blues while only actually finghting a couple mobs (and not even packs). It also comes with 2 guarenteed rich thorium veins.
---
Dwarf spriest. I dont think theres more a tryhard pvp combo than that for alliance.
---
Eh the Pally t0 set is mainly like A/B tier for tanks. Shouldn't really use any pally items if you itemize and hit dungs properly for tank
---
I think after 2007 it went downhill fast. For example if you just search metacritic for best pc games in 2007 you get a list of like 30 titles who are objectively great and defined their genre for years after. 2008 you have a few titles who are good like 6-7 or so, definitely a year that was worse than the previous (probably an impossible job to tackle that one). And then you get to 2009 and 2010 and you see unimpressive titles and maybe come across one and you're like 'yes that was a very memorable title I played'. 
---
A lot of these titles are sequels to previous titles released in 2007 that were so good as well. But almost all of these titles have had the common theme of casualizing and accessibility. Which made them often much worse products but they were accessible to a market of non gamers who bought next gen consoles, or started using the internet more with the advance of smart phones and looked into games. Most games just started to become a lot less creative after 2008, a lot less fun due to it and most of the creativity was put into getting someone that doesn't like playing games to play a game.
---
Most demanding pve stuff currently are split raids where consumables are needed imo
---
Still gets you really far
---
I'm starting to think that sub rogues play along with the whole 'sub rogue sucks' thing because it helps them get their daggers and gear. I bought Gut Ripper at lvl 40 for 18g because no one buys daggers. Im just so suprised that more people don't use this spec. I'm trying to figure out if it will work in raids because I don't want to respec - this is too good. 
---
I'm a freaking boss in world PVP - while leveling I litterally clear entire areas of horde because I can kill them at will. Eventually they just give up and go away leaving the entire are for myself to quest in.
---
I've had numerous amount of people tell me that my dps is absurd. Any time I can get a new ambush skill it feels like I just got a new epic weapon. I can crit ambush 80% of the time with remorseless attacks for about 700-900. When questing I start almost every encounter with 100% hp vs 50% hp.
---
Being the tank you reserve the loot yourself and have people join anyway lol
---
Wrong. Also your example is anecdotal as IF is usually this busy and ha sbeen this busy most of the time on Rattlegore for the past 2 months. You can't just claim everything is anecdotal just cuz u don't like the results bud
---
Edit: also wtf does ur guild have to do with anything lol
---
Or worse!
---
Is The Butcher worth keeping in the bank for phase 3?  Right now it's only selling for 15g, but I do see it as a good weapon for 29 twink rogues.
---
also badlands, just checked.  good to know next time i level a character
---
We're a sensitive lot.
---
I've been doing it loads, so damn much, I've lost it 9 times and now I just tag along with guildiea when they solo it for g and its not dropped in over 30 solo farm runs either.
---
I'm just gona try for the tarnished elven ring from dm now.
---
(Gonna put my .02 here, but this only works for the add on I list) Details! actually shows you the player's spec on the damage tables. It won't work on healers usually if they're not on the dps chart and that's all you're tracking. Like, for me, I'm a level 50 Fury Warrior, I can join a group and instantly see everyone's spec from the dps sheet.
---
Theres room on the left for abilities too by the looks
---
Tbh, It really is the result of people have no awareness or making mistakes
---
148 kills so far have not seen it once. Stay strong my friend
---
Ya succy is great for leveling cause the seduction is a great reset tool but you can tell who's smart by who opens on the succubus and then i'm just fucked. I'll never use felhunter for world pvp unless i'm clearly going up against the same casters again and again but in BG's my succubus just gets killed in a heartbeat
---
Nope. Case closed.
---
Speaking as a Dal Rends user I outperform dagger rogues with these gloves by s large margin.  Its more about time on target and proper maintenance of SnD.  Also anecdotal evidence is meaninless.  Swords has more AP equal weapon skill and equal crit but benefits more from HoJ and doesn't rely on crits to have good damager per energy.
---
sry wrong thread
---
The guild i am in pugged me for an MC their 1st week of raiding. Definitely worth getting into a pug group and showing you are worth your weight to get those nice raid spots
---
Stam and int and armor is all you want.  Block percentage is good too.
---
but female human or gnome
---
Its cuz the rest are in there farming it.
---
It kinda cheapens the gratz if it happens too much.
---

I can confirm it's only a few hours, like regular mail time, at least between guild members.
---
Had a guild buy Robe of Arcana off the AH and CoD it to me, but I accidentally pressed return instead of buying the item lol.
---
They then sent it back to me within 3 hours or so.
---
Simple map.
---
Let's you have a map open without taking ul your whole screen. If you move it becomes transparent so you can see through it.
---
Allows you to continue grinding or moving towards things on your map without stopping because the map takes up the whole screen.
---
TLDR
---
Windowed map. Amazing.
---
When considering +Fishing gear, is there value in having a fishing skill above 300?
---
Ah,  I thought her meant the golden pearls.
---
It's all these damn retailers.
---
If you completed the fire one, then yeah you're boned.  But until that point you can have both quests.
---
Plot twist: OP is the Black Bar
---
I got called ninja for needing SM amulet as rogue, when I had no amulet at all...
---
Sadly I need mine to craft my chest, and it's still only 20g every few days for my server prices.
---
People still play the original everquest..... I think classic will be fine for a good, long while.
---
Nice discussion thread, just OP humble bragging. We get it you played a lot
---
Engineering target dummy?
---
Yea succy dies easy. I typically keep her on passive and just use her to seduce.
---
Can we talk about the guild called Thunder Bluff Meat Co.
---
I've grinded that up to 220 thus far. Any fish you recommend or spots you think are worth it? I've found the blackmouth are the best ones to sell while I've been leveling it up.
---
Muggers belt is a better source than Distracting dagger for weapon skill
---
Angelinaholy, Demimooer, topless male human Bradfit.
---
All I can suggest is play at late night hours (like 2am server) or early in the morning. 
---
Or get a high level buddy to help you on that quest
---
Have you tried to study and grind mobs in classic? Cant really do that.
---
You can however do that in classic. Im just saying classic was more more pseduo afkable making tje grind much more bearable.
---
I think it’s a guy, named Fierceful. He’s a dick lol
---
thank you, I just rang up the local newspaper and they doing a front page run of my sweet achievements in tomorrows paper
---
Precisely that one. I knew I wasn’t wrong lol
---
Im a bit of a miserable fuck like Redguy, but I keep it to myself. As trivial as the event is, there's no good reason to piss on their parade.
---
I seldom toot my own horn much at all and never congratulate others unless I find it worthy of congratulations.
---
But I am aware it's a flaw in my personality, unlike Redguy here.
---
Dungeon meta was coming regardless of streamers. The streamers just sped up adoption.
---
I agree that they could have done more at the surface level, but I like the aesthetic of the underground city - it's a ziggurat just like others occupied by the armies of the lich king; it's very similar in design to Naxxramas. They constructed it in the time between the plague taking over Lordaeron and the forsaken regaining their free will.
---
At least that's the way I've always seen it.
---
Just go until you have a heart attack from over-exhausation or develop a DVT.
---
That's what I'm planning to do.
---
theres a guy on my server called Lamartotems
---
Prisoners went crazy* fixed it
---
If you get that much XP in BRD spell cleave, stay there. It’s very easy to exploit with 3-4 aoe. On more normal groups LBRS pushes your XP per hour from 60k to around 80k. And I am sure LBRS spell cleave is as insane but I only ever did it with myself pulling as tank.
---
Huge yes
---
Not even once have the alliance attacked a horde unless provoked..
---
I read the first sentence of this post for about three seconds before it was deleted. The comments say you are not a ninja. Have a good day.
---
I find Leatrix maps to be very flawed. Cannot zoom out of the zone you’re in. So you can’t really explore the map unless you click through all the zones manually.
---
#1 Maintain thorns buff it is deceptively good AoE threat 
---
#2 PreHoT helps initial incoming damage and is also great AoE threat (include barkskin as well, this is long duration significant damage reduction on nasty / big pulls)
---
#3 Don't forget that you are a druid and you have more than bear form. Tranquility on group when everyone is low hp after a pull will help a paladin. Innervating your priest on cool down will speed up runs. 
---
#4 If you plan on staying bear, begin investing in enchanting 265...With Ony quest reward and Ench  Smoking Heart of the Mountain trinkets you will be a beast tank in group content, and relatively prepared for raids
---
#5 Use enrage intelligently, if you are under levelled / under geared for a dungeon the armor reduction can be LETHAL
---
Nah yeah i never cod items. No guarantee the other side will pay up
---
report him to blizzard.
---
he will get banned
---
&gt; The new content will invalidate their progress in true WoW fashion and you'll be there to join in.
---
not really
---
First aid and food make watching netflix and grinding mobs in Classic very, very easy.
---
Potentially having a lvl 52 healer is okay since all heals always hit, but the same cannot be said for any other role lol. 
---
Fuck that guy
---
I’ll try getting it I’m on my last fish for nat pagle to get fishing 225+ open. From what I read the big iron fishing pole is a random drop from the shellfish traps has about 1.3% drop rate
---
KILL IT WITH FIRE
---
RE: Princess
---
Boot speed is required for this. I do it with similar stats, you just have to get good at pathing the rocks to regen mana. As soon as she gets close pop bear to soak the damage until she fart clouds. Innervate as soon as possible so you can get a second one up faster.
---
52 is good enough until ogers tbh. I was surprised, too. The XP is just that good unless you get screwed by counter-spells.
---
I ran brd foe the first time in classic (and first time in 10 years) a few nights ago, 53 arms warrior. Killed angerforge and HOJ dropped! Then went back and killed angerforge again and his battle axe dropped lol. HOJ is so op i love it!
---
Stam&gt; spell power&gt; int&gt; mp5.
---
Defrnse doesnt matter for paladins especially im dungeons. You get 60% avoidance from redoubt and holy shield. Only big defensive trinket i recomend is force of will for aoe packs. If you can get helm of narv for cheap i highly recomend it, even though it's mail, thr stats are very good for a prot paladin. Full T1 is what you want for dungeon runs since the 8set really speeds up clears and generates a good ammount of threat.
---
I tried twice, neither time did AtlasLoot work for me :( Owell.
---
Im pretty sure there are certain fish that can only be guaranteed catches with fishing skill well over 300.
---
Shhh don’t tell people my bank alt name! Also Orckefeller and Jpworgen
---
I have killed her 30-40 times solo and I've probably seen it 6-7 times.  AMA.
---
If you are looking for something more engaging, I would roll a tank character! Lots of stuff I going on all the time
---
I have had dwarves jump me on multiple occasions when leveling. They seem highly territorial of quest objectives
---
Also priests. I don't know what made them so aggressive, but they sure love to try and mind control you off ledges and engage in pvp
---
I have no idea where the assumption that I wasn't trying to gear progressively are coming from, but I was just chasing the next tier of upgrades, not trying to get carried. And the communication thing goes both ways, nobody ever said "we're doing the shortcut route", they just started running up walls and yelled at people who didn't watch some obscure Youtube tutorial about it. If Id known people expected this or that wall-jump route I WOULD have asked.
---
There are a few areas (Azshara's Bay of Storms, for example) that require 330 fishing just to cast, and you need 425 to prevent your fish from getting away.
---
How do I engage hunters as a Rogue? I cheap shot and sinister strike to start off, but It’s hard to follow up with a gouge since they wing clip me and I’m slowed. By then I’ve been serpent stung and tranq shotted. And without imp. sprint I can’t catch up. Even if I could vanish, they’d just cheetah run away.
---
I want to record my guild raid logs(classic wow) but dont know how, please help where to start. Thanks
---
Everyone knew about mage aoe before streamers.  It was a thing back in vanilla, it just went mainstream.
---
Name checks out
---
Everyone says demand will rise, but I'm of the thought that anyone who cares about creating a very over powered 19, 29, 39, etc is already accumulating their BoE gear now. 
---
In the end, it's your choice. I feel prices will peak about now for busy servers and 2-3 weeks for less busy servers.
---
The answer is bandages. Even healing classes should take First Aid to 300, imo.
---
*Laughs in melee*
---
I'm no wow veteran but in every MMO I played I love PVPing. So right now I'm a lvl 57 Resto Shaman cause I learned that Elemental Shamans are bad in PVE however I wanna collect gear so I can pvp in Phase 2 as Ele how am I supposed to do both? Collect gear for resto and ele should I give up and respec Ele for pve and try to find a guild that'll let me raid with them?
---
Go seal form, pop up from underneath on their bobber.
---
If they don't laugh, root and swim off.
---
Exact opposite from what you’re asking, but I think Booty Bay is one of the coolest towns in the game. It really is the capital city of the goblins as far as size/depth.
---
&gt;People have this idea that the BiS lists are not only gospel, but somehow required. 
---
Because they ARE gospel. We've MADE it gospel truth. 
---
Because it's been scrutinized and theorized for the past 10+ years on Pservers, which is largely irrelevant because BiS gear was already very much a thing at the end of 2005.
---
People have a limited amount of time to do any one given thing, and thus want the "best" of anything. In a world where Thottbot data was only populated by people who ran one specific addon, let alone even knew what Thottbot was, it was left for each player to decide what was best and what wasn't.
---
Get the addon called atlas loot and it shows you all the dungeons, the loot each boss drop and the recommended level for each one.
---
At lvl 26 you will be good to run Shadowfang keep, Blackfanthom Deeps, Stockades with a group. 
---
To solo? I don’t really recommend that since soloing requires you to be very high lvl and the gear will be useless.
---
Why on earth did the pug warrior get more than 1 piece?? Shitty raid leader
---
Welcome! What times do you usually play?
---
10 years ago, I had an addon that gave alerts when Nightfall or Avenger's Shield procced. The screen might have flashed, there was probably a sound of some kind, I don't fully remember. I have no idea what that add on was but I could really use some kind of alert so I don't miss these procs. 
---
Any ideas on what addon can do something like this?

1. Arathi Basin - Classic king of the hill type game but with a thematic twist of resource grabing makes it feel more like a battle and trying to get the vantage points and it's ever changing and flowing. It's less ping pong back and forth like WSG and more a constant flow and figuring out where the flow is going is the point. Love it. If WoW was just AB I would still play it. I cannot wait for AB to come out. 
---
2. AV - Ya I'm a freak who doesn't like WSG. I love AV for the massive scale but hate that it so often turns into a turtle on the bridge. 
---
3. WSG - I just hated how every battle felt the same. It's too small and too contained and certain classes have their specific skills to carry the flag so 90% of the time you know who it will be and what they'll be doing. AB battles were great because it's just people trying to kill eachother, WSG everyone is trying to stop the flag carrier so their attention isn't always focused on trying to kill the other team. I want a battle not a game
---
Joke item. Vendor trash!
---
It's because people don't actually understand class skills, abilities, or talents any more.. they google "wow classic leveling guide rogue" and that's it.. and all of them say combat, because combat is the *easiest* leveling spec. Not the best. You spam SS and evis to level, the end.
---
Sub rogues are amazing for leveling and PvP, have obscene utility and are just *fun*. Where they fall short are long sustained DPS fights and anything with lots of target switching, though target switching is annoying for all specs. This unfortunately means "raids", where every boss fight is a long sustained DPS race and there's no real use for any rogue utility.
---
If you want to raid as sub you could, but you'd lose out on every boss to most other DPS. I'm combat at the moment because the more DPS I bring the better for my raid, but once we're all a little more geared up I'll actually be going Assassination.. Sealed Fate daggers is *fun* and a very viable raid spec once you have some decent gear.
---
But yeah.. combat is 100% the most boring rogue spec IMO, Sub and Assassination are way better.
---
Exactly! I saw someone who wanted to just run angerforge runs (no arena/golem) with hoj reserved. Basically you want a team of people who don’t know you to just grind a boss for your personal benefit.
---
Damn ..
---
This is incorrect. Bait does not have an effect on the catch rate of "better" fish (except to the extent it reduces the chance of a fish getting away) and it doesn't speed up the time for a fish to bite.
---
unfortunately i didnt find a way to add trinket and back, back is cloak of warding 214 arm +4 deff (enchanted +70 arm) and trinket is vigilance charm (2% dodge)

Pretty sure they lose happiness at a constant rate, so it's no harder keeping them in the green than in the yellow. Might as well have that 25% extra damage.

Apparently! They also seem hell bent on "proving" that classic is dead lol

When I was lvl 38/39 I was farming this one area for gold for my mount with a bunch of 32-33 mobs. Didn’t want to dungeon run coz I was doing work at the same time so couldn’t pay much attention. Agrod a mob swapped to my work, half a minute later back, agro a new one. So forth and so on. 
---
Anyway this level 33 Rouge comes over, we have   enough mobs for booth of us, I could do one full rotation around the area without refilling my health and it gave me 3/4 of a bar xp. By the time I got back where I started they were already respawned. 
---
So this Rouge comes over and sends me an invite, first I didn’t see it because I was doing work, when I got back I just declined. That’s when he lost his shit and started pm-ing me how WoW classic gonna go to shit because of me, and players who wanna play it as a single player game. So I told him I’m not here to do quests like he is, he can kill that 12 mobs for the quest less then 15 minutes. I’m here to grind out xp and gold for my mount. 
---
He didn’t like that either, he started ranting how this streamer mentality of trying to get stuff as quickly as possible is ruining the game. Anyway I ignored him just kept doing my thing. What a surprise in 12 minutes he finished his quest and went about his way. And I kept on afk farming for 2 more hours. 
---
Don’t know what all that rageing was about.
---
Edit: spelling
---
Almost every fury warrior is a human at least in alliance side in my server. The reality is that many people do make their race decision based on their class
---
XD
---
Mained a shaman healer back in the day and eventually a pally tank. Didn't get a rogue main until MoP and always wished after that that I had one back in the day. Plus I had a friend that was a rogue main back in the day and he always fucked people up and it looked like a fun class to play. So I'm taking advantage of my second chance
---
&gt; when you roll on something that's a genuine upgrade for them
---
If they need the item, they would have bought it off the auction house. Alternatively, if its just a minor upgrade that they want to equip because they are dumb, I don't really care about that then, lol.
---
&gt;You sound like the type of person who rolls or threatens to roll on BoPs for their vendor cost when your mindset on this is this fucked.
---
Why would I ever do that? You can only get bops from dungeons, they are meant to be farmed in that dungeon and equipped right away as upgrades. You can't sell bop items on the auction house.
---
I wouldn't spend the money on Arcanite Draognling at this point in the game, 1min uptime for 59 mins of downtime along with a hefty crafting cost is pretty absurd.
---
It does shine later on in ZG/AQ since the +fire damage debuff it does makes it a dream for fire mages.
---
But a +fire debuff isn't going to help much in MC/Ony.
---
Yeah, but expect a rather long wait for groups.
---
Even longer for raids, some will say it's impossible. In reality it happens but only rarely.

While questing as Emmadotson, I saw a fellow lock named Britneyfears. We had a nice exchange of pleasantries.

Well i dont play retail currently, but when i last did i raided mythic and required quite alot of time spent keeping up on stuff outside of raid. Depends what level you play at and how much you care about minmaxing your character. In classic its easy, just aquire x gear. Retail, not so much, not only do you need it to drop but has to titanforge at least 15 ilvls and roll a socket to be as good as it can get.
---
Thank you for reporting reality as I tried to.

He can believe every realm is packed. That’s simply false.

Or just not a stick in the mud with no sense of humor

You seem dumb.  You not knowing how useful the puppy is in PVP confirms ... at the very least, ignorance.

Onyxia also was changed at some point in vanilla, she used to hit conflagration with the fireballs that caused significantly more damage.

Well if you can remember what faction you are this shouldn't be a problem right? Don't know why a pally would be talking in the horde log, but if so it would be gibberish anyways.

I accidentally used booty bay ah for the first time last night,  I didn't know it was neutral.  I put up a stack of heavy leather for a gold. Thought,  wow 90 silver is a high deposit. After I realised my mistake,  thankfully today I logged in,  1g 90 s in my mail!  Heavy leather goes for like 40 silver on normal ah.
---
Have someone invite you to a party. Usually a guildie or someone in a global chat channel. 
---
Just so you know, though. If servers still have layers, they only have 2 currently. Not all servers even have 2. Also, there is a cooldown on layer swapping.

By using paragraphs.

I mean, it’s not hard depending on the server. WRA has tons in the cities.
---
Cool

You should get that TDS checked.
---
I thought they’d be worth more as well but ended up selling mine for ~300.. my own guess is warriors are poor af lol. There were tons of these selling at one point so I had to sell pretty low

If they are beasts, flash bombs from a quest in the badlands might work.  I don't know how large a circle it is.

In future I'd Google or YouTube a solution.

At your level, the price of the portal reagent alone would be a bit steep, but I'm sure if he's the type to do this, simply telling him that he made your day is enough. I'm also fairly certain he wouldn't want you to break the bank buying him a thank you gift.

Get revered with every faction or at least your top 2 favorites. Get all the mounts your character allows and go for gold

Honestly, the discords I'm in require way more social skills than WoW. If you aren't brain dead you can get by barely communicating. Ive had a couple runs as a mage where someone is looking for a DPS and I just whisper (level) Mage and get an invite. Show up, buff and hand out water, and not another word is said the entire run. It's pretty fucking boring but sometimes I'm just grinding and watching Netflix so I'm okay with not starting conversation.
---
Exactly! Even ppl in this sub will try to tell you it's dead lol
---
I pug about 75% runs. The rest are usually with other guilds that needed 1

Try intermittent fasting and just play wow for the next two months. After that if you are still addicted and cannot go back to normal life, just walk away from the game. You sound like a person that can walk away when necessary. Good luck. 🍀

Roll shaman, use stoneclaw totem.
---
Except when you flip it while ignoring all context the entire system falls apart so it is not apt as everyone rolling on everything is a pointless comparison. 
---
I don’t understand why you types can’t just admit that you are a greedy c#d&amp;s. At least You would be respected you for the honesty. It is sad how you extol being greedy as if it is superior to cooperation. Do you always assume you are not going to be the one getting the upgrade or what?
---
Its just the fact that I am used to 10+ years of pally being pink and shammy being blue. Now I see pink and have to remember its shammy, not pally.
---
I'm in the same spot, just got my last dungeon piece (reed) yesterday. Craggiehackkie is basically right, the main things there are for personal progression is to farm rep (timbermaw for pouch, argent dawn for future patches) and gold. With gold, you should make sure you have +30 SP on your weapon, SP librams on your head/legs, and 2x freezing band (which it sounds like you have already). You can also solo farm Incendius in BRD for the frost damage enchant on his bracers, but that's a hardcore grind. Also raids get expensive if your respeccing and flasking every week, so having a lot of gold saved up can be really nice.
---
For PVP, get the Necropile set from Stratholme if you don't have many t1/t2 pieces yet, it's better than pre-raid blues for pvp and can be better than some MC epics with the set bonus. Also as he said, get your Arena Grandmaster and Tidal Charm, along with Nifty Stopwatch and Skull of Impending Doom. You should get all of the gnomish engineering items and get up to 300 goblin engineering too, it's extremely important for PVP and tailor/engi is optimal for PVE as well. Mages are amazing in PVP by the way, top 3 classes in the game for sure, top 1 overall IMO and they only get better in later phases.
---
Arugal rep, looking flash mate.

This has always annoyed me. Another one is when I'm doing a dungeon for the first time / a new dungeon has been released / whatever and I don't instantly know all the skips so I get told my mother drank while pregnant or whatever.

Crippling poison is mandatory in PvP. Your best bet is to kill the Hunter in a cheap shot to kidney combo.

Best I had was with 3 mages a warlock and a priest, lock summons green eye(forgot name) priest bubble and lock pulls all mages blizzard, we did prison loop and killed arena for casters to have a chance at belt
---
Although so far it seems it's just used for currently free realm transfers, I most certainly find the presence of the shop button somewhat distressing. I imagine/hope it might get limited to paid character transfers and that kind of thing. A game, especially an online one, untainted by real world purchasing feels like it hardly exists anymore but that button worms its way into my mind a bit on the character select screen. I hope my worries are unfounded.
---
i think you're having some serious trust issues. I believe that people that actually need it will equip it. if they don't they get kicked, and end up on the blacklist of people. eventually it comes back to bite them in the ass.
---
it mostly seems an issue once retailers join the group, I've had full vanilla groups and they always ask if someone needs ir before they decide to need or greed.
---
yesterday a guildy had the black skull shield drop in his group and they all instantly rolled need while the warrior actually needed it.
---
He asked us if he should sell the item to him for cheap, so we told him to just give it, because he should have no business needed on an item he can't use.
---
I play horde, but I’m down for either. Thinking of rolling a priest.
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
---
Do you have a lot “free time”? I mean like you can play games for 3 or more hours without getting disturbed by anything or anyone. 
---
If you don’t have these much time, I suggest you not trying classic.
---
Leveling in retail is more painful than classic because retail is totally endgame focused. Leveling in BFA is boring AF! But in classic, leveling and social are the fun part, but it requires you to put a huge amount of time in this game.
---
Lol...I love when people respond like you did here... you're either lying (the more likely of the two)  or telling the truth about your own personal experience and somehow that's going to be the experience of everyone playing WoW as well?

Umm... yes, that's quite a joke.
---
Even if those consumables where needed, for the sake of argument.
---
Imagine the cost of a 40 man raid of MC... Imagine being so strict that your raids costed 40x100g, 4000g per week... ludicrous. A guild that could pay that would be the lynchpin of the economy of your server.
---
Imagine the man hours if you choose to farm mats instead...
---
No, you likely don't need those consumables, it would be too ridiculous.

Shoulda insta equipped

A.k.a people with lives who still enjoy the game.

World of warcraft isn't the real size on the world, the books state that most cities have between 5000 to 20.000  inhabitants
---
Goldshire is said to have 7000  inhabitants while it has like 20 in game and stormwind should have 200k.
---
The world in game is probably about 1:200 of its real size.
---
Also hearthstone lore isn't cannon, ti's just made up for fun the gangs in hearthstone don't exist in the real lore.
---
Hell yeah my dude! I'm leveling a shaman tank right now. Only tanked up to SM Arms though.
---
Looks like kobolds finally got semi smart
---
if you want to play any game efficiently you have to do research on it in one way or another. doing the bare minimum of research and achieving your goals as a result of that research is one of the more rewarding parts of gaming, at least in my opinion. the mount in general is a massive time saver especially with the classic quest design where quests are not always near the quest giver, or even within the same zone as the quest giver.
---
People have mentioned how relatively trivial gear is for completing raids atm, yet those same people still put all the eggs into a single main tank basket?
---
As an MT in a guild, i cannot wrap my head around the desire to take priority on everything first if you are already blasting through MC without issues - I already get prio on Bindings, how greedy is it to also lay claim to farm gear first before others?
---
I'm sorry to say this friend, but i feel you need more equality, no guild needs only a singular main tank, and if they say they do, they are either lying or they are unfit to make such judgement.

My opinion is that in lower level dungeons its fine to roll it off. However in higher level dungeons that loot is more valuable. And the rogue is the one that spent time grinding chests. I always try to sort it out at the beginning.

Sounds like you're similar to me. We both have an addictive personality. There's no "playing moderately" for us. The only way to cut back is to quit completely.
---
Personally, I'm not there yet. I can see the light at the end of the tunnel though. I know I'll have to cut out this game for good relatively soon (way before Naxx comes out) and I'm okay with that. Just enjoying it while I'm here.
---
I'd say most people do. I have had dps try to get in my group when I only need tank or heals a lot of times. They usually say sorry that they misread or I tell them I am looking for a different role and then they apologize. Sometimes you just get someone with anxiety or something that panics, idk.

You have provided exactly zero counterpoints, so I guess I'm completely validated.

I found a macro, but I got tired of running it all the time. You have to run it every time you log in. And obviously it's not dynamic to things like combat status. Can you point me to one of the other addons that does this? I feel like I scoured the internet lol
---
You do, for the interactive console. But you can just execute console commands with /console, without using the interactive console.
---
Better tell them to quit with that pug shit and gear you up.
---
Warlock because I too like the idea of being decent in 1v1s. Thinking about all the moments in bgs when you're stuck in 1v1 situations and it makes me want to take advantage of winning those.
---
That's how I usually end up doing all dungeons but tbh I'm mad lazy so I rather someone else from the group and find people for it.
---
How the fuck do so many people in here count their damn runs??? Who does that
---
Nah, Blizz will kill it by catering to the people who race through content and push out patches way faster than vanilla.
---
Holy crap lol... I read about the chat settings tab and couldn't figure it out... thank you so much. Cant believe it was this simple.
---
You can get there as any class -- provided you're willing to do a couple corpse runs after dying from fatigue -- but using a water walking effect (Shaman's Water Walking, Priest's Levitate) would make things a lot easier

You articulate better than 3/4 of the US. Sound like a good dude

Start tanking.
---
It seems to be an issue with video drivers on Macs that have both embedded and discrete graphics. 
---
I’ve been able to fix it intermittently by manually selecting the embedded graphics, reloading ui and then changing back to discrete graphics and a reload ui. 
---
I’m hopeful that it’s something Blizzard can fix down the road with patches...not holding my breath though.
---
You seriously need to report that guy =o
---
Also when you have a dungeon group at 4am then you can assume everyone is a nolifer who is extremely well geared and ran shit for the past 7 days.
---
Yeah as in retail shaman is blue (dark blue compared to mage). I thought it always had been. I played way back in Vanilla but I may not have used addons and class colors in chat until wrath I think. So I never knew shaman and pally shared pink in vanilla. Until now.
---
Yeah... that whole 30 seconds it takes to cleave through packs in this iteration of the game... so damn time consuming and challenging.

At this point I have established a group of friends in classic to run dungeons with. We skip everything we can with no issues, but that's because we know the dungeons inside out and rarely asspull (and when we do we just laugh about it).
---
I like the efficiency, definitely more fun than spending twice the time on trash and we have time for more dungeons. 
---
Pugs I don't trust one bit though, they always manage to pull extra so in that situation it's better to clear. :P
---
30-40 was rough for me because Alliance aren’t close to SM, which levels you quick during that period. But from 40-50, do Badlands/lower STV (Booty Bay quests) and then Tanaris. Having ZF in Tanaris is a huge plus because you can quest a bunch and then run to the instance whenever you get a group. It’s a great area for 40-50 and with being either Alliance or Horde I’d imagine.
---
HAR HAR TDS AMIRITE GUYS?  
---
It's definitely over half the US population that has the mental illness, definitely not the one guy known for being unhinged.  Nope, definitely everyone else. 
---
It really says something when you have the invent an illness for people who demonstrate they care about the future of their country and the wellness of the president. Yet you ignore the blatant signs of mental illness in your president simply because he's useful to you right now. 
---
Y'all are wild.
---
MissingNo.
---
Assassin's Blade doesn't sell for 4g on the AH. The dagger was Sliverblade.
---
So there's an add on called short macros that you can't find specifically for classic, I just copied the retail version into classic version and it works. It let's you put /de at the beginning and /ee at the end of every macro
---
/de is disable errors
---
/ee is enable errors
---
So:
---
Hashtag showtooltip
---
/de
---
/cast spell
---
/ee
---
If you're using elvui by chance there are plugins that do it too
---
I found something interesting, in the beta Steamwheedle port was much bigger than how it is on live and gadgetzan was much smaller. 5 small houses + 1 big instead of just 3 small houses, it was almost the size of live gadgetzan

---
Plus there actually was a boat transport in steawheedle port ! (was probably planned to go to Kezan before they canceled it)
---
I get my extra sleep at work.  Kill 2 birds with 1 pillow.
---
For leveling daggers, put it in your offhand and quest normally killing green mobs. Shouldn’t take too long to get caught up.
---
So many triggered Trumptards in this thread now. 😂
---
The above method is reliable. What likely happened is that your tanks were not #1 and #2 on threat. Give them longer to establish agro
---
No one else has said it, but holy fuck 30 days played time in this timeframe is not healthy man.
---
That's a rollercoaster and a half.
---
They all rolled greed to sell initially, then realized someone rolled need to use em, then they wanted to roll to sell them..
---
Wat?
---
But hey, Kudos to you for having the cool-head to hand them over, even if you deserved to keep them.
---
Exactly. Wtf is the point of raiding if you don’t get to need on gear you actually need?
---
I learned to type super fast this way by playing MUDs, or text-based RPGs.
---
The one I played was called Gemstone III. It was on AOL, Prodigy, and CompuServe at first. Then they moved to their own web portal circa 1997.
---
The game is still around, called Gemstone IV now...I think it is the longest running MMORPG there is. I still have a character on there.
---
Anyways, you had to type out “attack &lt;creature&gt;” and “cast &lt;spell&gt;”...it was all based on round times too, so you’d have to be faster than the mob you were fighting. Add dial-up in there and you better be sure the command you typed was correct and accurate, or you be dead!
---
It worked incredibly well to teach me how to type at 10 years old.
---
...and I’m done...nerd alert!
---
I don't really take it all that seriously. 
---
Though Deadmines isn't too tough to reach for Horde. Just swim from Grom'gol and you shouldn't run into too many Ally going into the dungeon. Really the only issue is once you are run into the elites before you get to the instance. And BFD is actually easier to reach for Horde. Their FP is right next door while Ally have to cross half of Ashenvale or most of Darkshore to get there.
---
I've run into literally zero bad hunters since launch. Mages on the other hand.
---
Lock picking is their utility, it's for group not just for a rogue to loot. If he asked for a summons i'd tell him to fuck off. I mained a rogue too in original vanilla.
---
*casts cone of shit!*
---
Damn! I'm out! does anyone have more Little Caesars??
---
Don’t stress, I am very healthy. 😁
---
My server is pretty dead. I had to reroll on a different server with higher pop. 
---
Remulos reroll to Arugal.
---
I often forget that a lot of people are still leveling because either my guild or my server is full of 60s or late 50s players. Maybe my server is just so full that even with the majority still leveling there appears to be thousands of 60s.
---
That nelf tank is decked out
---
As a mage main: the only things I'll be AoEing are the non-elite mobs in early Stratholme (and Baron's skellies) and maybe the Rend event in UBRS. 
---
That is unless I'm given a go to AoE the hell out of the place. 
---
I'd just rather have a smooth wipeless run. Another thing that seems to be contributing to the number of wipes is the people's need to skip packs to speed up runs but end up wiping anyway because not everyone knows how to position. Just clear a proper path for goodness' sake (lookin' at you DM:N tribute among other things).
---
What are you confused about?
---
Battle shout gains a bonus threat value per entity buffed that's in combat, including minions, and then is dispersed across all minions.
---
Demo shout, now functioning properly, awards threat spread across all minions.
---
Demo shout is 100% unequivocally a mitigation skill, not a threat skill, and that's it. You will lose aggro spamming a functional demo shout over heals / AOE. Battleshout, under perfect circumstances, all people in range, 5+ entities buffed, is worth as a snap threat skill in the initial gcds of the pull, but good luck hitting all 5 so long story short, it's not worth it.
---
Tldr : engineering is your friend
---
Basically
---
Holy shit, so much this. All my wipes at lvl 60 also boil down to getting feared/aggroing skipped packs.
---
People think they're trained speedrunners and try to do this shit with PUGs which always end in disaster. Yes, you can speed up your instance runs if you skip packs, but having 5 people having to play blind Splinter Cell is a surefire way to failure.
---
So much of my time wasted because people want to avoid killing shit in a game about killing shit, wtf. That's at least 5 hours of my day yesterday literally wasted in corpse runs trying to wrestle with groups to kill packs and take the safest route. FUCK DM tribute runs, I got my Rod of Ogre Magi now at least, so I don't have to deal with insufferable tryhards.
---
When phase 3 comes out I'm sure people will be buying loads of twink gear, but also the many people who have been stockpiling twink gear will unload on the market and drive prices down.
---
Personally I'd just sell it off now, which is what I've been doing for all my drops.
---
On Arugal, theres a tauren hunter who will message you randomly then abuse you then /ignore you when you reply.  Classic is toxic now more than ever.
---
seems like an honest mistake
---
That was actually good!
---
Though it can be an arguably dangerous spiral of alt-oholism, I do think playing alts can be plenty fun. As of now I have a specific main that I really tried to kit out the best that I can, but there's nothing saying it will ALWAYS be my main forever and ever and it could just end up as a means to farm gold. Grind/boredom can kick in with that, whereas with alts the levels and new abilities come much faster, though I admit I have no alts in the 40+ range yet. 
---
I quite enjoy taking a break and messing around for even a few hours with a different playstyle and different professions, and the combination of gold from a main and rested xp from not constant play can make an alt feel like progression is easier, not to mention having knowledge from probably already running that content before. And who knows, maybe you'll find you enjoy something else so much more. For instance a rogue was actually my FOURTH alt that I made, with hesitation after the sometimes miserable experience of trying a warrior, and yet I found that I seemingly love that mix of melee and stealth. This almost "throwaway" idea of making a rogue may one day blossom into being my most active secondary character, or possibly even overtake as a real main.
---
From the perspective of the people in charge of loot distribution the last thing you want is an item to effectively disappear from your raid because you gave it to a first timer who won't show up for the next 3 weeks and then gquits to join a friends guild.
---
Most DKP systems also reflect this because a new raider will have very little DKP to bid on items, and will probably only receive at most an item that nobody else wants. They will have to show up next week as well to get some loot.
---
Yep. Every time. it is such a pet peeve of mine too. also when I recommend to the group that we DONT skip mobs all the dps bitches and complains
---
So fishing pole is the new white flag?
---
I guess choosing pvp server has its drawbacks, and not being able to fish peacefully is one.
---
Code of honor? Hmph... Rampaging 5 vs 1 is ok but killing a fisherman is not?
---
then you can do it by yourself next time :)
---
Nicely done!
---
Damn that'd suck. I didn't even know remulos was a realm tbh.... R u finding Arugal better?
---
How did you spec while leveling? In what order? I really wanna play pala tank too but im at a loss of how to go about it. I feel like there's so much talents that are so important and idk if i should go for consecrate first or what... but the light is calling me
---
As a newbie to wow my friends installed questie for me
---
For some of you down below I left space to call me a pussy and not a real authentic player just like the barrens chat
---
Dire Maul was originally released on Patch 1.3.0, WoW Classic started on Patch 1.12. They aren’t racing through content, it should’ve been out with the first release, and all it’s done is given the people who’ve been 60 for two months something to do.
---
And he’s doing a job that you don’t want to do.  Think of the tank gear you don’t need as his pay for putting up with all the crap tanks have to put up with.
---
You're fine at any 60 dungeon.
---
Even in MC/Ony you can do decent as Shadow, but most guilds will ask you to resepc.
---
I created the perfect mix of lofi hiphop beats, specifically for when you just wanna zone out and grind your sorrows away.
---
bingo
---
Confirming with the others, got mine from coffeer run.
---
On elysium ps. If you’re a rogue and there is a locked chest and no one else can open it then it’s yours. This is reflected in that the rogue has spent the time to level his skill in lock picking. I have no problem with this. However, it’s best to establish before dungeon starts that any loot in chests will be rolled on.
---
I did this,  luckily at the top I noticed the lift Haha but I thought the same thing!
---
first road block you will find when you step into mara/ atal hakkar due to some mobs being immune to nature :v Oil of immolation helps a lot :)   
---
although for me , hard wall was Golem lord in BRD , past that i couldnt go at appropriate level :/
---
Tidys UBRS item sales.
---
That's a good assumption since Intel doesn't give any spell damage at all.
---
call of duty
---
Remember when you said you had to download this later?
---
Enchanters can also enchant haste on gloves. So does haste really give cast speed?
---
They sure do.
---
You mean their primary customers?
---
Lmao sorry forgot about the thousands of hours I spent on my warrior, got me I’m just a rogue screeching, nah just someone who has an actual grasp on how the game works, have no problem passing on purple pixels if it’s to the proper class.  You’re going to sit there and tell me that fury using felstriker raiding until naxx they wont come across upgrades? You can’t say that, you can however say that for a combat dagger rogue and especially for a seal fate dagger rogue lol. Please become more informed about warrior, watching people like you run around on a class that was historically so great hurts my heart
---
My retail main is a death knight. II figured I would go with the lore origin of death knights, since Orc warlocks became the first generation of death knights.
---
Cuz they drop lewt
---
u/doggomilk
---
Thats good to know, thank you :)
---
Ah gotcha. I work the night shift myself. Good luck tho!
---
Leatrix does this as well.
---
*Oh, screw you*!
---
I've always had this issue any time i played with alchemy on retail.
---
However the hassle of switching between track herb and track ore is not worth it imo
---
I know,  it still makes me laugh to myself... let me have this okay it's a tough week for me Haha
---
This.
---
This is something good community players will do. There use to be a lot more of this type of player, willing to help to weak. Right now, classic is still new and everyone is pretty much out for themselves. 
---
What you can do for him is to one day, pay it forward. 
---
You’ll soon one day find someone asking for help. If you can help them, please do. 
---
Thanks.
---
Just get Axe of the Deep Woods while leveling, simple as that /s
---
No they shouldn't. I am a shaman. I don't roll on mage gear or agi gear. This is because I have no intention of playing anything but resto.
---
"oh a texture issue, maybe its one the bugs i know the fix too" - i thought. Then i saw it was a mac and noped out.
---
Agree 100%
---
First week of running MC* pugs are clearing 8/8 on my pve server.
---
corpse running to the instance because they're not as hot shit as they think they are
---
Hello my fellow priest brother
---
Did it once, no one needed and we all greeded. sold to vendor. How do you feel?
---
thank you
---
My favourite is the window jump in BRD to save like, 2 pulls? Someone always fucks it up and  causes a wipe for the sake of saving a minute, max. Bonus points if the group consists of sub 60s who can actually use the XP.
---
what
---
I think what helps is that there is a pretty insane amount of quests there. Like literally you can pretty much start some stuff around 30 and arguably stretch it til 50.
---
&gt; because he's useful to you right now
---
Which is hilarious because I'm sure he HASN'T been useful to this guy so far.
---
Yea I’m at 379 Def, but I have like 15/16 pre raid BIS, few MC epics and several optional gear to mix things around.
---
The key is balancing things out for your raid’s performance. If dps is cranking and healers can keep you up; drop mitigation and put on more threat gear.
---
Gear is practically a talent tree for tanks. You swap things out depending on the situation.
---
Those numbers are kind of a base line going into MC, and then you tweak with different priorities.
---
Yes and this is all you need to do. I would instantly leave the group in this case, because I don't need any healing item competition.
---
Yea.. ran it a ton but we are both very geared..mostly bis
---
Sorry about that the correct link is  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GXlRkdXoTA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GXlRkdXoTA)
---
Me too!
---
That's odd, since fire really drops the most. It drops in all of brd from the elementals, from multiple bosses too and it drops in MC in big stacks. Earth costing a lot makes sense though as I do believe it is the lowest drop chance out of them all.
---
Whip scam ftw
---
Lmao
---
Will they add more stuff to classic to keep it going? Or are they just gonna bring it to full completion, like, right before BC was suppose to come out and then call it a day?
---
Maybe complete the parts of wow they didn't add in coz of time constraints?
---
Or just use elvui like a non-peasant
---
Dang, if it were retail you could make a wargon and call him YiffBezos.
---
Great to hear. I just rolled it priest and I'm just 23. But I loved the idea that I could be Shadow priest and hold my own out in the world but also heal dungeons. You have A build you could recommend real quick as I level?
---
I ditched enchanting at the same level on my mage in favor of alchemy/tailoring. I'm currently leveling it up on my druid alt, but only to get smoking heart of the mountain because it's BOP and then I plan to drop it.
---
The only reason to have enchanting is to dust some soulbound gear that makes more profit as shards. 
---
It's very expensive to get your gear enchanted with buying mats + hiring an enchanter, but you only need to do it once, really, and you'll make more money grinding gold compared to buying formulas and spending time in trade chat looking for customers
---
Even if the reaver in the far right pulls you should be okay as long as your pet has him. You shouldn’t pull him yourself if you hug the wall. 
---
For Gordok I don’t use serpent sting at all because I’m not sure if it pulls him back at me. I let him get to the pillar my pets behind and then auto shot followed by aimed shot and then multi and if I can chase for a couple more autos and an arcane shot I will. If your not killing the ad I would just keep it at no mana by viper stinging it every time you can. Also I try to FD when he’s close and even when he resists he still goes back to my pet, but only if I have him LOSed behind one of the pillars. Occasionally he does resist and keep after me and I jump down then kite him around until the cool down is back up. If he resists twice I’ll probably die, although I did survive a double resist once. Just go down then back up the right side. Take your time kiting him as he should have a long way to run and make sure you control the add so it doesn’t kill your pet.
---
Edit: my most difficult pull is the one where you run up the ramp a bit. Has to be perfectly done it seems. Or maybe I should use my pet for it? I’m not sure I haven’t tried that yet.
---
nah id just kick you from the group right before the boss you need loot from :)
---
Wait, people are selling tribute loot? 
---
Nice.
---
He "triggerz the libz epic style" and that's all they care about. 
---
They want a troll for president , a dancing clown to entertain the drooling masses and they eat it up. They don't actually care about anyone but themselves and their cult.
---
That's cool, I got blacklisted everywhere for Needing on a blue mana ring as a warlock to replace my green boe in DM north, apparently not knowing every classes BIS item is a big no no in this game.
---
Nah her fireballs 100% drop the threat of anyone they hit to 0. Onyxia fireballs the person at the top of her threat meter (so the main tank) first then works her way down the list. To pick Onyxia up at the start of Phase 3 it's a delicate balance between having your 2nd/3rd tanks high on threat, but not so high that they get fireballed. Great DPS will help a lot too, as the less time Phase 2 takes, the less fireballs Ony will cast.
---
What makes this better than auctioneer or Titan panel? Those seem waaaaay better
---

If the rogue can open it, he opens it and everyone in the group rolls for it. Or he gets kicked from the group.

There is only a shortage of them if you are bad. I'm a healer and asked multiple times a day to heal dungeons. Fully ready with tanks.

Group up for a fireball hit, you don’t spread out, if you’re playing with people that yell spread out you’re wasting your time

Who said after a month?  Most people I heard said it would have a big spike then a large drop off after a month and slowly go down until it hits a stable population.  Which so far has been true.
---
Nice, are you a welder?

Please do! I would definitely use this if it sourced from the various auction addons, or had its own scanner.

Also options to just not even use ah prices if you're doing a vendor farm, and options to blacklist certain items that you won't be vendoring.

then its not "the perfect soundtrack for your grinding session"

wowhead has user made gear sets that i've found really helpful. [go here](https://classic.wowhead.com/gear-sets) and at minimum input the class you want to find sets for, and look for the ones that say pvp bis phase 1

I wish it was possible to downvote a post more than once
---
I never really got it, it's not even a matter of opinion, like not a thing you can bet on. There is a large population of people who play videogames who will not touch pay to win games.
---
Battlegrounds will be released then, and you join with other people in your level bracket- 9, 19, 29, etc. so people get say, a lvl 19 character and they give it the best posssible lvl 19 gear so it can wreck players that don't have as good of gear
---
I’ve seen this so much more lately, I guess due to the insane amount of greed people seem to have. 
---
If your in a group, it’s group loot. Roll for it and stop being a greedy dick. 
---
I say this as a rogue main.
---
Can you link to one of those posts?  I saw no one saying this.  I also searched for people saying this and I couldn't find any.  I saw other predictions but not "in will die in a month".
---
Nice that seems pretty efficient for a warrior. I’m at 48 and around 7 days but at least 12-16 hrs are me messing with ui or sporadically logging in while working to check on stuff. 
---
I realized quite late that the key to efficient leveling with warrior is only do quests several levels lower than you.
---
This is the perfect time to grind gold and level alts.
---
Must make them an alchemist...
---
The real question is if you waste more time trying to get the best or just doing what you want with less. Looking at you savage gladiator chain.

His plan was obviously to give us a chance to *join* the burning blade cultists! Or maybe to use us as a sacrifice? Or both!?
---
100% the best QoL item for lvling.
---
That is pure bullshit, you dont need any consumables to raid at this stage. 
---
You bring greater fire protection potion, elixir of the mongoose/greater arcane elixir, mana potions, health potions and bandages to make it easier for yourself and to compete on the dps meter for fun. 
---
Our guild does MC and Ony same day super easy. i still bring greater fire protection potions for rag and ony just make it go faster, and to try and top dps meters.
---
&gt; It's like expecting the mage in your group to give everyone in the party free food and/or water at the start of the run.

People do expect this though.

I was gonna say, DM N takes the Cake for this; after some spectacular fails tanking it today, I will be clearing a safe path from now on. Fuck skipping the ones that take 30 seconds to kill

Everyone likes to shit on shaman tanks, and while not the best they are certainly capable.  I once tanked and healed scarlet strath with four people and it went fine.  Also once had a shaman tank Onyxia with no issues.
---
There's no real rule that staves aren't good for melee, until 60 epics they get the exact same amount of damage as other 2H weapons. But most do have stats for casters instead, and there are no talents/racials that buff them.
---
There are some level ~20 blue staves that are better than random green weapons. There's one from ZF that's OK if you haven't found better. And there's a rather good one from Strath at 60.
---
Had to run 57 times to get mine. Seen people go way higher. 31 is about right to see one drop, but it’s nothing crazy.
---
Ok... I didn't say you did I said the pug groups I've been in lmao..
---
You're a warrior so if you tank and you have a brain , sure it may be lower but that's not the case for everyone so please don't act like it's not feasible lol .
---
There are shitcan tanks who think they can skip every pack and they are quite common.
---
Sample size. Your specific experiences don't speak for the whole of the community, like I said, 1/10 is a generous % for the average group

Do you have robe of the archmage already? If the answer is yes why would you want to keep tailoring over herb

Some people suck, some rogues do too. Most don't get invited to dungeons, so I assume it makes the ones who do extra greedy.

If he has no problem asking for a summons, food, and buffs, then he should have no problem rolling for a locked chest.

I rolled horde because all my friends are horde and I dearly miss alliance zones and towns.  I now have to tolerate desolate wastelands and mud huts.
---
That too, so many nice filters
---
Get an addon that applies the class color of the person whispering you.
---
That or just let everyone into your groups. You might even become friends with another warrior. Heck, maybe they already have what you are looking for, or maybe they appreciate how you helped them get an upgrade and they will be will to stay to return the favor.
---
30 days? Wtf? How many hours a day do you play?

What class, if any, has the most BiS unrelated to raids?
---
Cerulean blue, a gentle breeze... Thought of that episode as well.
---
I'm not sure what you mean, druids are heavily gear dependent, especially once you get HotW and a big bonus from int/stam/agi gear. Bear form also multiplies armor, so small armor gains make a bigger difference.
---
I have always found that a good dungeon group in the right dungeons and supplemented by a few easy quests is the fastest way to level 30-48 pretty much regardless of class. 
---
Doing quests as a druid is nice because of stealth at least but I am still sticking with dungeons supplemented by questing
---
it's only NA right now
---
I do. So, it'd be better to drop tailoring?
---
I originally picked warlock, since that was the first character i made but abandoned. Wanted to try my original choice this time. But i played warlock in the classic beta and got fed up with farming soulshards for pvp. Even with a full bag of shards, when i went all out in pvp i eventually run out and have to go out and farm them. I hated having to take that break from pvp. 
---
So i went with mage instead. Im very happy with mage. the only time im jealous of warlocks is when i raid or do dungeons.
---
It gets tiring at times. Every time I log on I get whispers asking me to tank random shit that I already have all the loot from. Not trying to do a weird flex, honestly just gets tiring making so many excuses to not tank something haha.
---
Him calling you tough was sarcastic...

I’m Horde on Incendius. Will KOS if I see him.
---
Maybe lower it a bit? 
---
Otherwise, this is great and I’m stealing your idea.
---
I think they will release one battleground earlier than phase 3 just like they did just recently with diremaul, people will be crying for it after worldpvping for 2-3+ months.

“Has a texture issue”.

Tbh I just like seeing the big orb off the ground a bit instead of the dome resting halfway. But I don’t even wpvp
---
Yeee. Represent.
---
I’m new to wow in general; which 2 professions are ideal for a healer paladin?
---
wow, so tough.  mommy loves you
---
Why's that?
---
Super impressive! Do you have imp FD?

From vanilla until I quit in wrath I mained a warrior, and loved it. I had fully intended to roll it again this time but in the last month or so leading up to release I slowly drifted to paladin. I liked the versatility and especially the class fantasy. I've grown to really like the support characters since my first go round so it seemed ljke the right choice. Still loving it, just hit 38 this weekend.
---
Alright, thanks :)
---
Life is so meaningless when there's nobody to keep you accountable. That's why we made God.
---
An interesting solution to this i heard was the rogue just getting a +10 to their roll.
---
Start of expansion boes were still high demand as well, I dropped a good 800k on weapons that weren't even socketed when I was gearing my two split raid alts before uldir release.
---
If you like to engage in pvp then hell yeah, the thing claps cheeks
---
Some damage gear will be used by healers so good luck rolling on that to start with. Most hybrids get some love in tier 2 and then a pretty good set from AQ, so it's going to be a while for really good gear for the spec. If you announce your intention beforehand, some guilds will let you roll on stuff for the spec you want instead of the spec you were invited to do.
---
There is a hybrid resto/ele spec that I have heard is extremely good for pvp and let's you heal some in PVE but I haven't looked much into it.
---
you should when you are gonna need on items that are worse than what you have. You were a ninja because you dont understand basic things like that.
---
I chose hunter because an old guildmate of mine was a hunter. He always seemed to be whooping ass
---
If I didnt play a pvp server I wouldnt have bgankers to hate, I wouldnt have in game grudges, and i wouldnt get that intense rush of barely escaping. I love to hate gankers.
---
Life is short and has no inherent meaning other than what you give it. Have fun enjoy the ride. Pick what makes you happier out of the 2 and stick to it.

Lol you didn’t cover his name on the /who. YIKES

---
I had  a pair of mages in tanaris tell me to fuck off for trying to do the pirate quests while they were AOE farming the mobs that drop the quest items, this mage shit is getting out of control.
---
Damn after reading this thread, maybe I should reconsider my gnome mage. I just wanted to call him shrimpbiscuit
---
A big dildo

*BRD lava run has entered the chat*
---
this is fucking amazing and I didn't get to play WC. I want this.
---
Make a friend and have them run in first
---
another post like this.. there are literally dozens made each day and the advice is always the same. So im gonna tell you something different.
---
No its not worth to power through to 60, just delete your character and spend the time doing something that can further your career in real life instead. Do stuff like that every day for as much time as you spent playing this game. a few years from now you'll thank me.
---
This is on my server. As of writing this, he posted in trade. Sent him a message saying I saw it on reddit.
---
Any addon to fix character+target frames? On some of my characters  the frames reset to the default position every time I log back on it... Problem seems to be titanbar but I dont wanna play without that.
---
ahh cool didn’t know that
---
Just today I did 10 solo runs, and saw 5 rings. I just delete them and will restore them later to vendor
---
Man, Hunters can do some really neat shit.
---
Playing WoW for 18-20 hours a day isn’t “better than me at WoW” nor is it a reasonable amount of time to “have to play”. It’s objectively fucking gross. The dude probably stinks.
---
Thing is some classes or specs are uniquely bad.
---
You’re absolutely not.
---
I really hope they fired that “you think you do but you don’t” guy..

Booty bay is essentially a slum. It is the cheapest possible design from an actual building perspective. From a designer perspective it is really cool ofc. 
---
You forget what kind of Goblins operate in these cities. Gadgedzan is under control by the Gadgedzan Water Corp. They build the town as a base of operations for their water gains. It also has a few other goblins who wanna make money like Noggenfogger, but it is mainly for the Corp.
---
Booty bay is a place for traders to resupply when they trade between the continents.
---
I'm just a person asking a question and you are just a person refusing to answer because you have no answers. You're being a salty child and that's okay, that's who you are.

Adrenaline rush and the sword expertise is what puts you over for dungeons

---
Isn't multiboxing a pain to set up?

Nailed it. I'm a fan of both but totally agree

You mean because people started playing classic?
---
No, you are a rude moron who cant take the time to read something properly and then gets super salty when your entitled ass doesnt get what he wants. thats who you are.
---
You replied to a sarcastic comment seriously. I tried to explain and you told me I was stupid and when I asked why you wouldn't explain. But sure man, everyone else is the asshole.
---
Forgive my ignorance..fresh rogue here. So step 3 restealth using vanish? Then how do we stealth again in step 5? Vanish would still be on cool down no?
---
Get alt to 10-15 &gt; go to Deadmines with alt and main &gt; invite 1 player who is lower level than you but higher than 10 &gt; rush Deadmines until 22ish &gt; Stockade until 27 &gt; Scarlet Monastery to 43 &gt; ZF to 49

Mage and easy aoe farming for gold and boy has it paid off. Started in late September and within 4 weeks I had accumulated over 2k gold and got my epic mount. And freezing band

What kind of job do you have where you can get away with this level of commitment?

i read the title and stopped at " **Ganked and camped story"**, went straight here to the comments to say this: git gud.

I'm an old guy... I started using Cerulean as a character name about 1~2 years before this episode came out. I thought it was pretty cool to hear it on there at the time.
---
What? Savage gladiator is still way better than the DM chest for hunters. Hell savage gladiator is better than Giantstalker Breastplate unless it gives you the 8 piece bonus. 2% crit is huge on top of the agility. That extra 1% takes I think 56 agility.
---
Well to be fair, WoW world is not to scale. Otherwise the entire area of the eastern Kingdoms would be taken over by the Elevynn forest alone.
---
What addon(s) is displaying that?
---
You're an awful person :(
---
seriously. snowflakes.
---
Same here, im enjoyinh it while it last and im hyped for pvp to arrive, then i want to and need to  take a break and maybe come back later if they release tbc
---
Ok?
---
just in that first sentence you were wrong.
---
I would be pissed if that happened to me. You don't want to open the chest and roll fairly with the group? Ok, then you can get the fuck out of the group. Rogues are a dime a dozen and I know plenty who actually respect the importance of teamwork. It's part of your class identity. It's your job as a rogue to utilize your class skills for the benefit of the whole group. That'd be like a mage charging party members for water.

Gnomer is trash don’t do that dungeon.
---
Warrior: “I’ll tank this instance but I’m dps spec and here for dps gear”
---
DPS: “no you tank, roll for tank gear, not dps”.
---
Warrior: “why would I want tank gear over Dps gear? I’m just tanking because you literally can’t”.
---
DPS: “so you can tank better (for us to get better dps gear)”.
---
Everyone: “why are there no tanks???”
---
People roll on things they can and will use, not just things they can use that make them more useful to the dps in a dungeon. Warriors have to quest, grind and make gold, deal with wpvp just like everyone else.
---
A fury warriors spec is literally dps, just because they can tank better than a rogue and fulfill the role of tank in absolutely no way makes that their “spec”. Their talent points don’t magically change because the rogues can’t possibly tank.
---
If I’m healing on my ret Paladin while leveling, no, I’m not going to pass on significant dps upgrades I can use and just roll on healing gear that’s of no fucking use to me but to.... get more healing gear....
---
Did you read the letter to Erdogan?

Yup! I've ran Mara two and a half times from 48-50 and got gator bite, the plate legs and the ring, and helm.  I literally never want to go back there because it'd be pointless but I get whispers all the time. I feel bad because I know there's a tank shortage
---
So I was just going through it with my rogue about 2 weeks ago and had no issues. I think the problem is aren't that many players at that level at the moment. Everyone is pushing to 60 or raiding with their 60s. Most anyone at ~30 is an alt i think.
---
I think it's just timing
---
Sure lmao
---
I'll have to look into weakauras more. I'm using it now but it's not giving me alerts like I'm looking for. I'll have to see if that's something I can turn on somewhere.
---
Man, this is why I don't tank on retail. I love tanking, it's the funnest way to play the game imo, but as soon as you're in M+ and don't go the EXACT fastest route, it's a shitfest of people telling you you're garbage.
---
Filthy alliance rattle scum. I’ll find you on battleground one day! &gt;:)

i hope you're ready to also change your real life server from *Basement* to *Dumpster*, since you obviously belong there you garbage human being.

good riddance
---
P.S.: after going through this shitheads post history, it appears he's from australia. considering this, there might be a high possibility he plays on *Arugal* and is going to switch to *Felstriker*. if someone playing on Arugal or Felstriker sees this, try avoiding anyone ingame named Flyingquill or something similar
---
This, you can usually read players and tell if they know what they're doing or not, if people don't seem to know what they're doing I usually type put what to do for each pull/what mobs are skipped. Seems to help a fair bit, I only find it a little annoying when a &gt;60 player complains about skipping because they want xp. Just chill, you'll still get a bunch, and will probably hit 60 long before you're done running these dungeons.

Appreciate it, thank you!
---
1. Random insult/joke towards you/others.
---
2. History of the place or item.
---
3. Explanation as to what happened with item or person.
---
4. Actual directions.
---
5. Relevance of completing the task.
---
I like being an annoying, dotting piece of shit. Now run around for a few minutes and try not to run into any mobs. That'd be disappointing.
---
Redoubt is misleading. Taking a crit in order to proc it is not exactly a winning trade, you often took more damage from being crit than you saved by blocking five times. Its biggest value is helping to make sure you get more shield spike damage.
---
Defense is a good stat for staying alive, don't worry you will still get crit plenty. The biggest issue with defense/dodge/parry/block is that the most dangerous damage you'll be taking is magical. Only stamina can reliably help with that.
---
There's not much point in stacking pure tank gear as it will leave you running short on mana, and strength is not worth much. A mix of Deathbone and Lightforge will do fine, it's hard to get much spell power which is what you really want. Raid tier plate is obviously great so it's easy to maintain your gear set as a raid healer.
---
Oh so pay 2 sub fees?
---
BOE epics have always been need rolled. Rationale is everyone needs to get the BOE bis or even the mount. Just think of it as gold for the winner. In a guild run, what can be done is that it is sold and shared amongst everyone in the group. Or equiped if someone needs it. 
---
NOW, it is good form in a PUG to offer it if u win it to someone who will equip it at say 10-20% off the market price if he equips it there and then.
---
Someone lied to you. You can run through the barrens to Camp Taurajo and then just follow the road west into Mulgore. Might see the occasional lvl 16-18 mob but should be able to get to Thunder Bluff relatively safely at level 11.
---
The best way I’ve heard it said “The tank’s hp is the healers job, the healer’s mana is the tanks job.”
---
To expand on raids, when you kill a boss you get saved to a Raid ID. You are locked to this version of the raid until it resets - most raids do this every Tuesday/7 days but Onyxia is on a 5 day reset. So yeah, people do this every week and try to get in a guild that works for them (some people can do weeknights after work, others wait til the weekend, etc).
---
Edit: also, 5-10man dungeons have the same instance IDs, but can be reset 5/hour so is much less noticeable for the average person running dungeons and not target farming something
---
You’re 💯 right and the disposable dps is just mad (my current main is a mage). Everyone needs DPS items. Are the DPS from my dungeon runs going to be at my beck and call to run around and kill things for my quests for me? Protect me from wpvp? Grind rep and mats/gold for me?
---
No? You want heals when I’m on my pally than fuck off - I’m rolling on dps items. I exist outside of the instance. I don’t just exist to help you get gear to do all those things and then rise/repeat.
---
Classic was released less than two months ago.
---
I'd reckon that maybe a few days of this guy's /played can be attributed to afking, but regardless that's close to or more than 50% of every single day being spent on WoW for the past month. 
---
I'm not saying that I haven't binged this game some days, but can you honestly imagine playing for 12+ hours every day for a month? That gives you what, 6 hours for any other responsibilities you might have, and 6 hours to sleep?
---
There is no possible way you can frame this where playing that much is not a problem or detriment to his life outside the game.
---
Staffs do more dps,  basically the only stat that matters, coupled with at least a 3 second attack time compared to equal level axes/swords/maces. It doesn't matter if you lose 10 strength to just be replaced by intellect, the 20 attack power is greatly overshadowed by having 5 more base dps. It's only key axes such as whirlwind axe, bone biter etc which beat staffs dps.
---
*nods*
---
you mean the " Robe of the Archmage"? or a different robe?
---
Get the lowest damage white or grey weapon of the type you want to level (crossbow in this case).  Then find a mob 30 or so lvls lower than you. Things like bears are good. Attack mob,  watch Lawrence of Arabia, wash, rinse, wipe hands on pants.
---
Man I am lvl 48 and burntout. I could not keep up with my friend anymore and now he is 55 and I have to quest alone which sucks. I die cause the quests are a lot harder then I say fck it and get off :(

Battle Shout's threat was **not** split between mobs in Vanillla. The [blue post](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/demoralizing-shout-is-bugged-and-it-is-why-we-have-this-aoe-meta/295678/62) I mentioned says they "fixed" incorrect splitting which is the worst way to state something in the history of statements cause it gives no indication as to what they consider "incorrect." Given [players' testimonies](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/nerf-battleshout-spam/227555/102) from testing it's still unclear what the current behavior of the skill is, but it doesn't look like what it should be.

i like how the super easy to see yellow text is the one he didnt notice needing censoring.
---
You 're that guy who see's someone in High Warlord gear and immediately comments on how much of a loser they must be in real life.  I would really suggest you try picking up a different game if you're going to have that kind of attitude. Classic WoW rewards dedication and endurance and some people play A LOT.  You may not agree with his lifestyle choices, but is it really necessary to comment things like that whenever someone expresses pride over their accomplishments in game? It goes against the entire spirit of Classic and its really obnoxious to listen to.
---
Tangential, but in vanilla my roommate was leveling a paladin along with my feral druid. When he was in class sometimes I'd open 2 instances of the game and login to both accounts. I had macros to follow my druid and macros to cast holy light and blessings. I'd just ghetto multibox with alt tab to remove any down time and ensure I could bear aoe pull if I felt like it. I doubt it was faster than solo, but it kept me from getting ahead of him in xp.
---
You don't need to understand astrophysics to know the basics of what one thing under that category does. The fact that we're having this conversation is more than enough to make that statement a fact.
---
This is racism against trolls.
---
He's not wrong and the triggered snowflakes know it.
---
Nonfood form is to just give it to the person who actually needs it. Your logic is what ruined wow the first time.
---
Imagine being triggered to the point where you make a post trying to explain that you've seen the light and "can't beat 'em join 'em" is your motto now, but just under the surface this is actually just a post about you being mad that someone ninja looted you once upon a time and you're actually really hurt by it despite you acting high and mighty.
---
How risky is it to pass mats to someone to transmute? Specifically want to get arcanite bars done, but really don't wanna lose my mats.
---
So what I'm trying to say is I personally didn't say anyone saying that.  I don't think I saw a single post about it or a streamer saying it.  Nothing.  I'm not saying NO ONE said that but it just didn't seem that prominent to me.  I also don't frequent the Blizzard forums and I don't know how any sane human can (lol).

Vastly superior intellect that can't detect sarcasm.

Your first Q - either someone was within 20 yards or you were the one getting hit.

Edit: ignore the comment about you being hit. It has to be people within 20 yards.

There's more information available now, we have our past experience behind us, the hardware has improved significantly (particularly kb/m) and we're on a version of the last major patch so yeah everything is easier now.
---
Layering is gone therefore dungeon leveling is the fastest? What?
---
Let's not act like Alliance are the ones that have it rough when it comes to that. Alliance city locations and FP's are better than Horde at 60 for raids/dragons.

Skullforge Reaver does a small Dot so some raids may rage at you for taking up a debuff spot for a full 60s for 120 damage. IIRC
---
Ahh, yeah now I get it.
---
To be fair, it is quite late where I live.
---
im not sure you are the one who should be saying that.

Mages rarely trade food to the tank.

Hope this happens to me, I got HoJ first run too, just last night!

i mean he seems happy, according to him he’s healthy, and he seems to have a girlfriend who also plays with him. so why are people shitting on him? he also doesnt seem to be worried about bills or rent so i dont see an issure here
---
if i had the chance to play that much, dodge S/O aggro or play with them, and be healthy and living fine enough to support myself id 100% do it.
---
Tanks and healers need dps items too - we don’t stop existing once the dps isn’t around to kill things. We have to do that too, on our own outside the instance.
---
Every. Spec. Needs. Dps.
---
Just because that’s all you need doesn’t mean you get it all...
---
Layering allowed for super optimal world mob grinding by eliminating a ton of the spawn time, it's why Jokerd got world first.

My blanket rule is to engage any gnome on sight if they are less than or equal to my level. Gnomes must be deleted from the game.
---
I give people credit for staying! I'm extremely busy in my normal life and ended up stop playing. I don't have a "passion" for MMOs like I did when I was a kid, I'm more much of a sit on my butt after work and watch Football/Hockey kind of fella now. However, I will say my couple weeks coming back to the game I was amazed! I had such an incredible nostalgia trip, I hope it lives on for a long time!
---
I wasn't the one who responded seriously to obvious sarcasm.
---
I’m well aware. But if you’re running with someone and they can use it, that benefits you. And that’s also how you integrate and build relationships in an mmo. Gold can be made anywhere. Give the tank the pants of the tank can use the pants. This is not a discussion I intend to continue having. My opinion stands and nothing you say will change that.
---
I actually made this post to relieve myself of any guilt I may feel. I stated this in the post lol, did you read ?

Imagine being triggered to the point you replied to this lol . I’m dead
---
8 days 14 hours 54 min

You did the right thing. Would’ve been a scum move to equip 800g.
---
DM W is a nightmare even at 60 if you don't have a priest and a lock. I didn't have the best gear going in the other day, barely had 200 bonus healing as a restro druid. The pally tank insisted that we didn't need CC, despite me having tanked it a day ago (had to respec for raiding), and knowing those ghosts and Pylon elementals are pure murder. 
---
Needless to say, we wiped, several times, despite me pleading for him to use CC. I even explained the logistics of it, how I could only cast 5 regrowths without going oom, how that would take 10 seconds to get one on everyone, how my aoe heal is channeled and has a cooldown, and how we were getting hit for \~500 damage every 3 seconds. I was told I was the worst healer ever after our 5th wipe and was kicked and ignored. I did it the next day with a tank who understood what was going on, used CC on every pull, and we got through it with only a single wipe on the 4 pack before magister.
---
That sentence is wrong on so many levels
---
Can’t stop the mongoloid greed though. I’ve tried to explain to groups that it should go to the person who actually needs the item because of  BIS over the asshole who won with a /need roll just to avoid a ninja situation.
---
You “caught up with him to tell him about the portal” Lmaoo.
---
You could just type in party chat. Let’s face it, you assumed he was being shady... and he was. Some jacked up stuff to not open chests. Hell, if you can’t LP chests in dungeons you’re running, you need to be getting that up first. Such a basic skill
---
I can't enjoy competitive team based games for this reason. Stresses me the fuck out.
---
I find it amazing you can call someone a retail player based off your "unsubstantiated" opinion lmao.
---
There were realms that were/are dead and that is why blizzard has offered free character transfers to those realms. To populate those realms and free up space in the highly populated ones. I don't understand why you're so upset about this lol
---
We suffered 3 wipes on the last boss in UBRS after a clean run because the rogue insisted on not clearing the pack in the corner near the bridge. Pulled 3 times after we started hitting Drakkisath. The rogue rage quit, we cleared the pack and killed the boss no worries on the next attempt. Last time I listen to a DPS that says "we can skip that."
---
Now you can't do either.
---
Jokerd would’ve gotten it anyway. He used layering for the last level.
---
Alliance player
---
The irony though, I see mages charging people all the damn time for water
---
Were the other players randoms? If so, yes, he should have removed himself and formed a new group with his friend. But alas, a minor transgression, and life goes on.
---
You’ll leave combat while the hunter is sapped and you already killed the pet. waiting couple seconds afterwards you’ll automatically leave combat making you able to stealth again
---
I agree. Gold is easy to farm, rare items actually useful to equip for characters are rare, let people who actually need it to need it. People are just greedy and I detest the above thinking. It’s gold people, to vendor some grays for an hour, give the man his armor.
---
Why are you so angry lol
---
Yes sir, robe of the archmage.
---
You take that shit and put it on. If you wear the boe, then you are fine in my book. Everyone who says otherwise is a greedy POS.
---
You can, but the question is if you should. For instance, I was in a guild run for scholo, where we took a lvl 52 in. We had to clear twice as much because of his aggro radius. He healed it just fine, but it took twice as long. Fine for a guild run, not so much when pugging.
---
I wanna be the Orc Slayer. And my sister the Priestess. Duo on battlegrounds. Also it’s easy to find groups when you have a tank and heal already.
---
Nah there was a lot of theory crafting back then.  Some of it didn't hold up over time but there were definitely ppl like myself who researched in depth mechanics and had supposed BiS lists.
---
Well said.
---
Which profession are you dropping for tailor?
---
Yeah i just charge people for tanking if they whisper me. for mara 10g, ulda is 5g but i get pendulum if it drops lol
---
Why? Someone else is just gonna go buy their BIS gear with the gold and do the same thing
---
Had a mage spend a good 5-10 minutes drinking and making multiple stacks of food and drink for everyone. Obnoxious waste of time lmao. Give mana peeps the drinks and the healer will top everyone off
---
Dwarf priests are bastards.
---
That’s called beeing a tank during leveling / preraid phase bro
---
I'm perfectly aware of it, but you can't exactly erase the past 10+ years of associating the color blue to shamans, which is a perfectly good reason to want to change the shaman color from pink to blue.
---
Do you even DPS bro?
---
Everyone needs dps. I tell them I’m rolling on dps upgrades on my healer from the jump unless the tank really, really wants it and if the dps complains 90% of the time within a min or two they are kicked and replaced with one of the million other dps.
---
My main this time around is a Mage - I lose dps cloth to priests all the time. Because no shit, they need to deal damage too outside of the instance.
---
Luckily, it doesn’t really matter if dps undestands this or not. And because I do, I’m the first dps my healers look to for runs.
---
HORDE OR BORED!
---
A lot of us did theory crafting and figured out what our ideal gear was based off that and thottbot and wowhead.

Anyone else just run around where they cast to scare of the fish?
---
My favorite was the completely unrelated comment of his: "You got a small ass dick and she wanted a bbc"
---
It's in the base menu options.
---
He got too close to the voodoo
---
Yeah, I agree it came out a bit too high up. I'll get the next one!
---
Only one that actually needed and in hindsight I shoulda taken it but yeah nice little me hope he’s happy with his gold
---
Bad ass!
---
That dude was selling DME runs the other night. I asked how much for the run, he said 40g (not bad tbh but still too  high for me). I declined and he lost his shit at me in chat. I considered Toxic as a guild option but completely wrote them off after that.
---
There's a big difference between "disagrees with the president politically" or "doesn't think he's doing a good job" (the over half the population number you're probably referencing) and "literally cannot have a conversation about unrelated topics without trying to shoehorn a blumpf comment into it".
---
Just sayin.
---
Rolled a lock, heard shadow priest was similar, and I like hybrids, leveled an elemental shaman, switched to enhance at level 30 in tbc Expac and never looked back.
---
Probably just push too far.   You'll probably do this in dungeon s and raids and wipe you who
---
Hole group.   At least now you know what to look for
---
Why not ?
---
I’ve seen groups clear air eles and not skip the ghost packs on top of the boss more than I have the way I described
---
Nah, we just use welder jackets as PPE in the fall.
---
Hahahahahah
---
He's talking about HoJ I think
---
Yes. 
---
Its good for extra binds
---
if I understand you correctly: if there were some people who were within 20 yards of me and I was the target, I would not be knocked back and they would; If there were no one within 20 yards and I was the target, I would be knocked back.
---
&gt; 
---
My thoughts as well.  It has to be a young teen or an adult who's mentally unwell.  Either way I feel bad.
---
I'm not even sure wtf you're on about at this point.  You complained you lost Skullflame and Foror's, yet state that you roll Need on all BoE's.  You sound like an asshole complaining about karma.
---
Puggle.
---
basically monitors your active chat channels and flags keywords for dungeons/raids and puts it into a nice UI. It's a life saver for me as I no longer have to watch chat 24/7 when LFG or LFM.
---
You can even create your own flags. For example I was LFM people to do the onyxia attunement chain where you need to kill the 3 dragons (horde side). So I created a flag for "test" "skulls" "ony" "onyxia" "dragons" etc etc.
---
&gt;not correct, most are better to disentchant and then sell the materials in the AH. There is an addon that calculates it.
---
Except you aren't selling your mats or the gear otherwise you wouldn't be starved for gold.
---
&gt;also i fucking love the "should have done your research" argument. Sure i could go out and read guides after guides on how to play the game the most efficient and streamlined way. But isnt that the exact opposite of why all of you people praised it? Do people recommend to play dark sould blind or with guides?
---
I'm not sure the dark souls analogy is a good one since you don't really have lasting effects of bad choices, though I could be wrong since I don't play it. Regardless you now have the lasting bad effects of being poor since you didn't do any research or really even try to save/make gold. I never praised classic for its ability to be played with zero guides, although if you're referring to many on this subreddit saying anyone can play classic they're own way or whatever then sure, I agree, you decided to level enchanting and tailoring. You played the game the way you chose to and now have very little gold as a result. 
---
&gt;and its clear that it is a design flaw. Professions are good in the endgame but complete and utter shit when they are below 300. "The journey is the goal" "The leveling is much more important in classic" my ass. The professions suck as much as they do in retail. Dump gold into it until you have max level
---
It is definitely not a design flaw, think about it without being salty for a second, does it make sense that a max rank enchanter with loads of recipes should be able to make more gold than one at 75 with +10 to beastslaying? You even mention it so I shouldn't have to say this but crafting professions are a GOLD SINK until you are max level. I also never mentioned the leveling being much more important in classic, but it looks as though you're conflating leveling a character and leveling a crafting profession as the same thing.
---
At the end of the day, you made yourself poor by choice, own your bad decision and get more gold, get your mount a bit later on and enjoy the game, oh and maybe read a few guides.
---
raptor or gorilla. highest level of those are 40ish and 50ish. or a crocolisk
---
Spooky
---
Not gonna lie, the guy who trolled you is a god amongst men. 
---
You will never forget that time some random
---
Sent you on a wild goose chase all over the world to get to orgrimmar. Neither will you forget the guy who logged onto his mage to save you. 
---
That 3 hours wasn’t wasted, it gave you what all of us have been chasing for years.... The true “classic” experience. Congrats mate you found it at level 11.
---
Very interesting, thank you
---
Tell me, how else are you gonna get em smart-ass? No need to be rude the moment your intelligence is lacking behind, toxic wanderer.
---
in the first torchlight game i backtracked to explore a tiny corner of a map i missed and a mob dropped an epic set piece. it's like, "great! now i have to clear every map i ever see... just in case."
---
Upvote for visibility.
---
the words " *(excluding the target) "* confuses me a lot.
---
I love it
---
Everyone can use gold. 
---
IMO if you are a DW fury, the edgemasters do way more work now, esp since DM has launched and u have a great free alternative to the legs from DMW. 
---
You are selfish to think 4 other people's needs will come after your own needs.
---
Because that drop is effectively 800 gold (or however many) for everyone, it has the same value for everyone. Just because some guy needs it to equip doesnt change the fact that if he didnt get it he would have to buy it, putting its value as a purely monetary one.
---
And everyone can roll on Gold.
---
There's a relatively niche craftable item that a random and I are doing this with on my server. I was the only one selling them for a little while so the margin between mats and 100% auctioneer value is about 20g. I still compete with the guy for about a 5g difference but neither of us really go below 15g margin. Benefits of picking less popular crafting specs.
---
Mail him Mana potions if you don’t need them.  Of course they’ll be useless to him but the gesture is steep.
---
Brb calling my therapist and the FBI.
---
Yeah, i love mine. Makes it a lot easier to play. Especially since i have stiff fingers and pressing keybinds with shift/ctrl/alt often cramps them up.
---
Trash usually dies so fast in dungeons, if you have improved SnD you could just pop after your Ambush and it will last most the fight.. Maybe pop after the second BS if it’s a larger pull.  Blade flurry backstabs are awesome...  you most likely will pull aggro on the second mob. I do extremely well with combat daggers, but sometimes when things are crowded and it’s hard to find the “back” of your target it can get a little rough. SnD being up at all times is essential.. especially when BF is up. If a mob is close to dying and there’s more in the pull, throw SnD up again even if eviscerate is tempting. Works for me
---
Maybe i‘m missing a joke but around the lake there are many camps of these foed, they are not only around hogger.
---
dude you roasted him good on that one, nice
---
I chose mage, and was enjoying it, but my friend left the game. So I decided to do what I wanted to do in the first place and roll horde b/c I've never had a horde toon past lvl 20. I went warlock just because I wasn't that sure what else to be. Got bored at lvl 43 so I made a hunter. Still having a bit of fun with him. He's lvl 47 atm and I just started leveling a priest because I often crave healing every once in a while. So now I juggle rested xp. I enjoy all classes though. I don't think I have a favorite. On the brightside, it's definitely made me better at pvp and since I used to play fairly competitively in MoP I like to think I can handle myself fairly well in general.
---
Clearly you’re unaware what the definition of selfish is.
---
Alliance on my server are all pathetic cringe kids and kill all fishers and low level questers non stop with their lvl 60 characters. They also camp almost all contested dungeons with 60s as well. According to reddit its to prevent horde from leveling up. I just think they suck so bad at pvp thats the only way they can kill people is when they are 10-30lvls higher.
---
Damn that's a good price on my.server, they goin for 50g + rn
---
I've heard that Gorillas are great for soloing lower level dungeons, but other than SFK I can't really understand why you'd want to do that.
---
Unless I'm missing something.
---
A guild picked me up for MC yesterday as a 57 holy pally.
---
Phase 2 honor and world bosses really gonna make things crazy.
---
grats on level 19 buddy!
---
Except i dont think that blue mana ring is BiS for anyone (If you're talking about the mp5 ring from dme like i think you are), it's just pretty good. It's also pretty good for warlocks, so it just sounds like the people in your group were dicks. Salty dicks will tell people they're blacklisted, but really they're doing you justice because those players are the ones that are shit to play with. I bet that player was a mage.
---
Nope. Not at all. Everyone needs DPS. Healer gets dps and healing, because they do both. Tanks get tank and dps, because they do both. Healers/Tank’s don’t stop existing outside of the instance. You going to follow me around and grind my rep? My gold? Kill while I heal in wpvp? No? Then I need dps gear too.
---
The fact that dps cant do anything but dps doesn’t mean as a ret/holy hybrid I’m going to let you vendor a bop piece of healing gear because I’m rolling on dps gear and no one else can use it. If there’s a Spriest or even Retadin there in DPS role, they can too, regardless if I’m the one healing; next time they might be.
---
Wasting gear is dumb and counter productive for everyone. 
---
Everyone gets their role and dps (ie, what they need) if dps doesn’t like that, cool, gl running anything w/o healers and tanks. We can always get groups of dps that’s fine with it. Even when I’m dps I insist they be able to - because more tanks and healers is a good thing.
---
The only caveat is: I wouldn’t take some DPS’s preBiS. Prob even if I was in DPS role for a dungeon since there’s no chance I’ll raid as that. We need DPS, but it doesn’t have to be BiS. Otherwise, upgrades are fair game.
---
Warriors are in a different situation because they absolutely will be raiding as DPS.
---
If you confirm the exchange in chat, they'll get banned for scamming if they run off with your shit.

It’s funny, I negotiated a Dazzling Longsword at level 36 for my Rogue paying 17 gold for it. There were a couple on AH 30+ and I caught one of them online. Now they’re going for 50+ here. 
---
Despite not being optimal speed / damage for my MH as a Rogue, the sword was so ungodly powerful at level 36 (with a strong proc), I absolutely decimated mobs for the next ten levels and flew through them.
---
I would say it’s definitely smart to make a reasonable investment into good weapons, only delayed me getting my mount by a level or so.
---
Great! So I drink while tank has 20% hp. My mana is finally full after 30 seconds, so I heal him and then drink again for 10 seconds. Now we can proceed.
---
Yes, because if Classic failed you’d be for sure seeing 1000  “you thought you did” and “classic players BTFO” posts
---
Don’t come to the sub so often if you’re tired of seeing the stuff
---
Razer Naga for me... 12 on the thumb and 3 on top is plenty and I have a Razer keyboard / mousepad also so the coordinated lighting is the bomb.
---
killing 400 of the same mob and you are unsure if you are killing the right mobs because nothing drops. But you are killing the right mobs it just takes ages.
---
Bloodfang EU is not layered and is one of the lowest populated realms though, this was bound to happen. I believe in prime time it has maybe 2k players.
---
True, it’s no where near dead, but all the hype band wagoners / tourists are gone. For instance, I think this sub’s subscriber count has dropped significantly since it’s launch population
---
It’s not hard to pick the retail players based off their comments. A review of your post history reinforces it - I could be wrong of course.
---
Good post.
---
Wrong thinking on the transfers: the transfers are offered because the servers which still have layers(2) need to reduce the active players so they can remove layering and launch P2. We have logical evidence of this.
---
As for why you pissed me off? People who repeat a lie, create enough belief that the lie is true, then people make decisions based off it which in this case is creates a self-fulfilling lie.
---
E.g. if enough people believe that a server is dead, new players/people looking to move - won’t, thus reducing growth of that server and thereby making it a dead server.
---
I have nothing against an accurate description of a server (takes 30min to find a BRD group at peak hours!) 
---
Make sense?
---
Macros. Use this one for example. It will always show and cast the highest rank. Don't need the quotations.

Dang I thought I had it bad with 14. It’s sad to know that 1/200 (0.507%) of people will have worse luck than you and not see it until at least run 21.
---
Even I felt that but no, he’s just bad
---
yeah its not a bad idea. Cheers i'll through that one in my bag of tricks for when we tank more difficult stuff.
---
Having tanked all through vanilla and most of BC, as a warrior..... bear tanking is a bit weird.
---
I run a Razer Naga Trinity mouse with a Razer Tartarus V2 game pad and a Razer Optima Keyboard.
---
Get a Naga and watch yourself get better overnight.
---
What’s that map add on?
---
Just skip the ring. Don’t overwork for a piece of gear if you stop enjoying the game because of it.
---
IDK. I thought you wanted pets most 60s don't have.
---
As an Affliction Warock how much should I prioritise +shadow power over stam + intellect? Im level 52 and have been rocking the Shadoweve set since 40. Quest gear stats are really starting to massively outpace my shadoweave gear. When should I upgrade?
---
My mistake, you won’t be knocked back if you’re hit.
---
Yeah you can create your own PUG raids but there is no LFG tool to do that for you. You're going to spend forever just getting 40 people in the raid group.
---
Then the next challenge is getting everyone to the instance. Did they bring consumes? Did they all repair their gear? Did they all bring their necklace to get into Ony?
---
Holy shit you made it in the instance. Hopefully by this time you've set up all the 5 man groups using optimal class composition. Oh shit 3/4 of the raid didn't bring any Arcane Protection and you're wiping repeatedly on Shazz? People are getting discouraged and leaving? Better hope you can replace them quick if you want to make Rag.
---
Why do all this when you can join a guild, have everyone show up at the same time, typically prepared, and clear through the raid in an efficient and coordinated manner.
---
Not saying you can't PUG if that's what suits you. Just don't under estimate what you're getting into.
---
i mean every raid wants at least 1 shadow priest
---
Ohhhhhhh Canaaaaadaaaaaaa
---
You missed my point. There are 3 levels of gear roles. Main spec. Off spec. Vendor. You get one main spec for any individual run. As many off specs as you want. If there is a warlock and a holy priest in the same group the holy priest needs to declare if they want their main spec to be healing or dps. If dps then they roll against the lock for gear and have to roll off spec for any heali gear. If they chose healing then they get prio on any healing gear and if the warlock doesn’t need the dps piece they can off spec roll on that. 
---
Ms&gt;os has existed forever. It’s a very simple concept. I have a problem people saying their main spec is tanking and dps and rolling on both as prio.
---
You’re spare parts, aren’t ya bud?
---
I've gotta ask, What loot was the one that pushed you over the edge?
---
Ahhhh 10th grade. Take me back.
---
Been running quite a lot of dungeons as tank/dps (feral druid) and I don't think I ever seen myself or the tank being half hp after a pull. Also I have encountered many healers who simply not using lower ranks of heals which makes them oom every 2nd pull.
---
Go on foot. Will be faster. lol
---
I like seeing hunters with unpopular pets. Roll with what looks good to you!
---
At like 13 days played at 56. I afk way too much after  dabs and watch youtube videos. Also working 70-80 hours a week and girlfriend slows the progress but this shit ain't a race!
---
I have been hit twice in a row, so there's 0% chance that the fireballs drop threat entirely
---
You're confused as to why World of Warcraft would beat out socialisation?
---
Wrong about the blue light. I use a blue light filter which is now actually built into Windows to reduce the amount of blue light on the screen which is better for your eyes and makes you less tired. It's actually the blue light that is not good for your eyes and causes a strain on your eyes which makes you more tired.
---
Gr8 b8.
---
Yeah the key is to not turn in every quest you complete right away, or you end up spending 3x the time just running around. Some quests I hold onto for 1 or 2 levels until I naturally end up back at the quest giver.
---
Same, lucky us it seems.
---
druid? buff plz?
---
The item has 20 min duration that’s 2 attempts. Just make ur hearth feralas if u need to beforehand so u can hearth to dm and get summoned back and get 2 more attempts. If it takes more than 4 attempts try again next week I guess.

If only raid gear was an indicator of a good run. I was just looking for a rend run to do that part of the ony attunement chain and got a message to join a "fast geared guild run of full UBRS". Everyone in the run had at least 2 pieces of t1 and things looked good, until they realized they had 3 fury warriors and none was a tank. One of the warriors who we thought was a tank (he said he could and had a shield) took 40 minutes to get there and then immediately left when he realize there was no tank. But we had some dope heals so having another one throw on a shield should be no problem... except that guild must be the short bus guild because multiple people walked over eggs, got knocked off shit, or would pull extra groups by accident. On top of that the new "tank" kept going afk without saying anything until right after the beast he just peaced without a word (and by peaced i mean he was the raid leader and just left himself afk for 30 minutes while we cleared without him and found a real tank for drak). I asked for raid assist to mark like 4 times, but never got it. I think the run took like two an a half hours, and I have no idea how. 
---
That being said that healer was an idiot. It usually works out waaaay better if you going with geared people.
---
Few people have it. and the 3 people ive seen that have it on my server as horde, havent even gotten full bis.  Ive seen more Hand of Rags than Bre’s.  
---
And then things like people perhaps not going the correct spec for it, not spamstringing, bad WF up time. etc.
---
It's really easy if you aren't careful. Well.. the dwarf squads are easy to wipe on.

What is the mod that lets u see who an enemy is attacking  under the enemies portriat?  Need for healing.
---
If the only support you add to a group is opening boxes that's what you do for the group. You didn't get the box on your own. A dps can be replaced by any other dps, so the only incentive to inviting a rogue is to block another caster from rolling, or to have him open boxes.
---
&gt;Rogues and Blacksmiths should have absolutely no obligation to roll for locked chests unless there is another rogue/blacksmith in the group.
---
Sure but we are under no obligation to take rogues to dungeons either. Most rogues do open boxes and chests, so I don't know who you are arguing for, yourself I guess.
---
I always top up tank and party before I drink in case something gets pulled. Seems like common sense.
---
KitKat of the guild ETHOS on Kirtonos

Don't give up hope on the game; What happened to you was an experience you'll find hilarious when you're eventually a seasoned veteran.

It's built into Windows now it's called night light.

I guess Thrall should stick to PvE since he's trying to maintain the peace.
---
I remember players I've met from the opposing factions I met whilst levelling who weren't assholes, when I meet them today I /wave and hope they remember me.
---
People expect Mages to use their class skills for the group, rogues should do the same. Most do.
---
&gt; A review of your post history reinforces it

Not sure if you looked at the right post history
---
&gt;  I could be wrong of course. 
---
Correct

Rule 2 for self-control, don't not have it.
---
Every time I hear about the tank shortage I kind of lol - I get at least a couple invites a day from tanks putting groups together looking for dps; just because my alt is a pally and I was like “oh, fuck, this really sucks, I’m basically here to get more healing gear to get more healing gear that does fucking nothing for me but let me be better at kitting out rando dps”.
---
Now on my Mage I always say from the jump “everyone needs dps”.
---
In a contested zone?! Fair game.
---
Those damn shadow priests who can't heal because they don't know how to turn off shadow form!
---
Or blacksmith?
---
Then I can roll on every bop drop to vendor it right? I deserve thunderfury to vendor it I need the gold
---
nah I’m good
---
Is it better or worse from a PvE perspective that I'm playing as Alliance on a server that has a bigger Horde population (Thunderfury)? Especially from a grouping perspective and gearing

If you want me to /ignore you, just spam trade chat with the same message 8 times in a row.
---
I think for paladins and warriors is common courtesy not to roll need on different role gear. For paladins, if they are tanking not to roll on cloth items, unless nobody needs it. For warriors if they joined to the group as DPS not to roll on tank gear, like shield or +def items, unless nobody needs it. 
---
It might seem that this way you are gonna grind twice as much, but you are the one who gears up for both specs right? You are the one to blame in that case.
---
What about the work to get to the chest....?
---
What?
---
In PvE, spellpower is definitely king. Although you also want some stamina on your gear to make life tap smoother. But if you're using the drain tank build, it's a good idea to neglect some spellpower to get more stamina instead.
---
In PvP you want to stack stamina whereever possible.
---
Hope this helps a bit.

Yes but take a few dozens of you but each with a different QoL request, add them up and we're back to modern retail.

Ragefire Chasm is best done at ~15 with all quests from Undercity (2), Thunder Bluff (2) and Orgrimmar (I think 2 or 3).
---
Ragefire is also within Orgrimmar.

There will be a lot of times where you need some additional info on the game, do yourself a favor and don't ask in general chat, just Google it :).

Druid tank here: your best threat maker is Maul. The threat is multiplied by the damage the skill does instead of being a fixed amount. When you pull enemies start with the roar, to get a small amount of aoe threat, but don't spam it. Once you have all the enemies on you and roar'd start spamming swipe and tab targeting.
---
If you lose agro on something taunt it, but if your mage wont let you get agro it is his fault if he pulls everything and dies, not your's. Regrowth before big pulls and keeping thorns up is really the rest you have to do.
---
I remember this scam from D2 in like 2003, it's as old as scams themselves

Don't worry the mob still has Teebu's Blazing Longsword and he's waiting for you in the next instance reset, you'll kill him one day.

What language is your guild? Csoki seems hungarian name, also Manika can be as well.

Which one you got?

Keep it up, it's cool to see peoples names you recognize often. If I wasn't so broke I'd join in.

Unicorns, haha🤩 still my preferred spec. Swords is just playing safe. I like a challange💪🏻
---
The DM East jump run takes about 15 minutes, the dungeon takes almost 45... there's a lot of trash involved, but there's more bosses to get.
---
Haha what? I'm 60, raiding, and go out in the world all the time. For one I farm herbs so I can make potions and hand them out to the raid when needed/use them myself. I also go out and help friends/guildies all the time so I get there much faster when I do. 
---
I also still go out and do quests for fun items and such I might not have and just overall go and play in the world we have here. 
---
I am just utterly baffed at how anybody can think of an epic mount as "just a status symbol". They're crazy useful.

Oh and all that aside... what the hell else are you gonna buy?

Lol you need to seperate your life from the game, there’s a serious underlying issue here my friend I’m worried for you.

So the time I've spent grinding soul shards doesn't count? I guarantee you I've spent way more time doing that than the time it takes to level up a profession.
---
And unlike a profession, my grind doesn't end; it's something I'll have to do forever.
---
Especially warriors seem to like my healthstones... 
---
I guess by your logic the utility I have is for me alone to use. So no more summons or healthstones for anyone
---
My go to reaction is to just run to the tank. Keeps the fight contained and help the tank not have to chase after me for a taunt.
---
Helps that I'm a paladin and can wear plate, though...
---
I bought the Logitech G600 for Classic but turns out I don't like side buttons at all. Everyone seems to love em but I prefer keyboard bindings.
---
Wow, 3 people remember you did dungeons with them... Time to post on reddit.
---
❤️❤️ save your money for P3/4 loot 😁👌👌
---
Additionally, you have to ask yourself why anybody would ever want you to COD them something.
---
If they had the money and wanted to buy it, they'd buy it from you straight up, COD only makes sense when it's something like you're out questing and don't have time to go meet the guy to buy it.
---
My entire friend list is only good tanks I've healed over time (Hot friends?!?)
---
Any source on gold having IDs? Sounds hard to believe.
---
POGGIES
---
They screw you out of gear more often than not.
---
I think those who complain are often those who are not i  the core raid group, it makes logical sense for the all-stars to get the loot, they are usually the heavy lifters of the raid.
---
However it sucks ass if you are in the B team. You don't need to be an officer to get special treatment, you just have to be in the main groups.
---
You likely don't hear drama because you recruit well picking mature players or are setup in such a way where the drama never reaches the top brass. Maybe drama is a bootable offense and people don't act up as of yet.
---
Maybe it's just the squeeky Reddit syndrome. We only get jilted supps and actual bads whining here. Also it would be bizzare for someone to chime in about the virtues of loot council. Hence why you get people bemoaning loot council.
---
Awesome, thanks for this. Very chill. Low stress, easy grind.
---
I'm still not sure if this is about 60's or sub 60's.
---
For 60's skipping mobs makes a LOT of sense, for sub 60's is makes no sense at all.
---
Are you saying he got ripped off big time? I Have always played a priest so I don't know much about this stuff
---
On a PVP server it’s gank or get ganked I don’t care what you’re doing followed by a /y macro, It’s Warcraft not Fishcraft after all.  (unless i need to get a quest done that an all out war will get in the way of then I wait until quest is done and go back to see if dude is still there.)
---
I'm imagining that at the time the avatar was created OP didn't know that the faction imbalance would be as pronounced as it is. Also, correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't believe character transfers from Pagle to another server have ever been offered. I would imagine once/if blizzard offers character transfers off Pagle that you'd see a even more pronounced imbalance. I see as many or more alliance avatars in the barrens for Wailing Caverns compared to Horde. It's bizarre.
---
You are probably better off without those dicks honestly, but in the future you can always ask before you roll need. If I'm thinking about rolling on something that I didn't go to the dungeon specifically to get I often check with the party.
---
1...
---
I'm saying it's a *huge* waste of money. There are comparable weapons that are easily obtainable that are basically free.
---
The EQ progression servers were meh when I tried them because they  are so baby-fied from them EQ I remember. Respawn with all your items, way faster XP, double xp weekends, every class can gate, the list goes on for days. I mean I get it, actual classic EQ was insanely grindy and punishing and nobody has time for that anymore, but it just felt cheapened.
---
Add me in game, character name Lucathomas - whisper me and mention this post and I'll get you some bags and a little gold to take the pressure off for a while. 
---
Feel free to ask for help on a tough quest and if I'm free I'll help out!
---
As healer I can relate. I tend to collect tanks and I have noticed a fair number of people have collected me. I love my server! &lt;3 Kirtonos.
---
JOBS DONE
---
Yeah, its not "required" to complete a run, but if it works like spell hit rating works then there is a 96% chance a spell will hit a mob the same level as you, but spell hit rating can only push it to 99%, meaning there is always a 1% chance for your spells to resist, i could be wrong, but i believe imp feign death pushes feign from 96&gt;99% per mob, so you will notice a lot less resists with this talent.  
---
Also, from my experience feign death can not be resisted at all if you have a big distance between you and the mobs + being behind LoS.
---
People forget DKP is not binding.
---
Typically you CC immediately after the pull, otherwise you get the initial pull agro on all mobs.
---
hahahaha I remember 'you think you do, but you dont' No I really do, thanks!
---
Was the queue your server had a month ago bigger than the queue it had yesterday?
---
Dont touch my pools and you live.
---
For me most have been because tank has not waited until casters have mana...then all you need is a bad pull
---
"I dont have time for this" *tank leaves party*
---
I'm hoping I won't need to buy gear by then! Hah
---
Druids are low key awesome tanks for pretty much everything too. Even raiding they're great. But they're also awesome healing and not terrible as cat dps. Plus boomkin druids may not be good, but seeing one is like seeing a unicorn. I'm always willing to take a boomkin with me because their dance is amazing.
---
Dude, Wyrmrest Accord Horde-side always has a metric shit-ton of people on. Neither version is anywhere near as dead as its Haters claim.
---
Not another ATM Machine situation!
---
It's funny how different characters have different personas sometimes, even when not on an RP server. I was a big carebear on PvP servers for many years but when I made a Mage in Burning Crusade I was the most aggressive thing in the zone. They got so many tools that made PvP so fun that I couldn't help myself.
---
Are you on a German server? I had the same with a druid. He looked for a tank and DD, so he was the only person who could heal in the group. Started going into bear form on the first group of mobs, my HP was at 1000 HP...after asking "Um...heals?" he looked to our shadow priest who joined after the DD request, said "you heal pls" and faced the next mob group.
---
What people don't understand is that even if a healer can deal with all that damage, they will pull a lot of agro.
---
Yeah, but what are they gonna do? Damage you?
---
Is this funny? Yawn dude
---
I think the way xp works is it goes by average level of the group, so by adding another player lower than you it brings the average down more than another player slightly higher than you.
---
Execute and pvp with pockethealer
---
Such a fine Thang
---
If you think DKP is binding you're dreaming.
---
You can forgo upgrades and end up with enough to out bid someone on an item and have the main officers go "Reserved for the main x role".
---
"Corruption" can break any system.
---
Damn that's scary puttin that real info out there!
---
It's all good, you get better through practice.
---
This advice really only applies to pugs.
---
Catchup gear? Never heard of it
---
The Twitch desktop app can be used to install/update/delete classic addons. I don’t play retail though so I’m not sure how similar it is to Minion.
---
I stilll get server ques @ peak times occasionally, arugal-oce
---
I've read that a low to medium sized current classic server is that off the high - full ones of the past.  It'll be fine even if they downsize to one in  a decade
---
This guy is a bit of a dick
---
We just downed Rag and Ony last week and we're making steady progress on gearing. We're not the only ones either on the server. Classic is doin great
---
I am close to that number. Took me 210-220 "?" runs for the second HOJ to drop so i finaly got it in my group. That was like a week ago and i still have no glad chest. Never saw it in vanilla either and i ran BRD and strat daily.  
---
It is so elusive for me hehe.
---
The ratio doesn't matter for groups. If you have a large enough Alliance population it will be fine.
---
You do not get a discount at exalted in classic. 10% from honored, 10% from pvp rank 3.
---
10% discount for Honored 
---
10% discount for Rank 3 PVP (not out yet)
---
Exalted with a race allows you to buy that other race's mounts of your faction.
---
I just wounder why I always see those posts but I never see these players myself ? Is this a PVE RP realm thing maybe ? Where are these bad players lurking ?
---
I wounder how can one person DIE in BRD. Let alone a full group wipe.
---
I want video footage of someone dying in BRD. I want to analyze it and see for myself what could possible cause a death there.
---
So I got the pattern for Swiftflight Bracers (Cache in DM North so relatively new). I don't think i'm server first, but the actual bracers haven't been sold on the AH yet. 
---
Swiftflight Bracers give +41 Ranged AP.
---
BIS wrist rankings for hunter are (According to a wowhead guide):
---
1. Bracers of the Eclipse. +24 AP, +10 agility. 16% drop from Prince T in DM. 
---
2. Slashclaw Bracers. +1% hit, +7 agility. 37% drop from Halycon in LBRS. 
---
3. Shadowcraft Bracers. +15 agility. Inexpensive on AH
---
4. Beast Stalker bindings. +15 agility. Inexpensive on AH.
---
So unless I'm mistaken, Swiftflight bracers seem to fall just short of BIS for hunters. But they can be readily available on the AH if I make them, and BIS competes with other classes and are rare. Thing is though that the mats alone cost around 110g.
---
So I have two questions: Am I missing something here about their utility? And secondly, if I'm right about them being second BIS, would there be much of a market for them at that price? 110g is a pretty significant chunk of my funds at the moment so I'm reluctant to test.
---
Never used one but likely trade over gold and the casino rolls. If the roll is ~55+, you double your money, otherwise you lose. Could also be an even 50:50 roll, but the odds are like 1.9X. Either way there’s some sort of house edge.
---
Fuck those friends
---
Well it doesn't, but since warriors don't use maces in pve you usually pass it to hybrids
---
lolwut.  DM has really good upgrades to many classes
---
Yeah, I understand.  I'd love to go back and relive some dungeons/raiding back in the day - but no way in hell I'm doing an EQ1 grind.  WoW Classic is about the slowest pace I'd be willing to deal with now.
---
I would say anything worth more than a 100-150g is fair game to all. Just my opinion though. I normally just go with whatever the rest of the group is happy with.. not that ive had anything more than 150g drop yet though. Best thing was flask recipe from scholo, which as an alchemist i actually wanted, didnt win it.
---
Is there any addon that can add up all my playtime across all characters for classic?
---
Cant seem to find Altoholic for Classic on the Twitch Desktop app
---
Why?
---
Gold
---
I downvote every, "imagine being..." Without reading.
---
Looking for player(s) or a friendly guild on a west coast server that is not pvp.  I'm looking for other adults who love the game, want to have fun and make new friends! If this sounds like something you're interested in, pm me so we can move forward!  I played from 2008-2018- mostly DPS. Thanks for reading.
---
The "L2heal" meme is completely false. Elemental, shadow, and prot pally are all viable. They're just not the best, so people who only read guides and don't try things repeat that they can't perform.
---
All specs are actually *more* viable in Classic because the threshold for killing bosses is so much more loosely tuned. It's only when you want to do speed runs or are severely undergeared that the "weird" specs can't hack it.
---
But what's the cause of it being worth more later?
---
If the community tells you not to use pets you want to use, you should tell the community to go fuck itself.
---
Your only obligation is to play this game the way that makes you enjoy it.
---
this post is as useful as me taking a picture of character by himself and saying realms are dead
---
Depends on the situation, if edgemasters drop and a dw human warrior wants to take them to use... thats a waste. They are not really any better than other gear due to human racial. So someo e who is missinformed that they are good for them could screw someone else out of 500g
---
Fuck time to level my tank alt faster
---
Incedius | NA | Alliance 
---
I'm currently playing a human warrior (got to level 13 today) and would love to group up for some quests (and dungeons, when appropriate) with people! I'm new to WoW so I'm liable to make a few mistakes but I'll do my best to tank everything I can :)
---
It seems to go both ways too. On my server there is a trio of gnome mages, whose names I will not utter here, that constantly kill afk players in Gadgetzan from the top of the cage, and camp the Timbermaw entrance in Felwood to blow up rep farmers. They have managed to cause so much salt, that raids have been put together in order to get rid of them.
---
It's truly heartwarming.
---
Not true, I had the most awful shaman in my Scholomance group last night. He sat in poison clouds and died drinking. Happened more than once. He never dropped totems. The group stuck it out with him and tried helping him learn stuff even. It took an extra hour probably but in the end I went from hating him to warming up to dealing with his noobishness.

MAH ENGLISH AIN'T WORK TOO GOOD
---
Lil' Sebastauren.
---
So.. what about a macro on a loop?
---
What about a really really long macro? 
---
What about a drinking bird hitting your macro?
---
That's only in raids.
---
In dungeons a good warlock worth his salt does:
---
\- VW shield to decrease the strain on the healer one bigger AoE pulls or bitch pulls in general like the ghosts in DM:W
---
\- make the little imp sit next to the warrior at Baron Rivendare, so the fury warrior who picked up a shield does not get oneshot
---
\- knows when to hellfire (not in the Scholo zombie room) and when to rain of fire (in the scholo zombie room)
---
\- knows how lifetap so his health and mana is in balance to both eat and drink (way too many WLs sit their with full mana eating waiting for their health to replenish, because they life tapped to 1 HP)
---
I dont say it's  a hard life, no role in classic PvE is hard but once you see all these little pieces come together you really see the difference between a mindful good warlock and one watching netflix lifetapping to 1 HP then dying to a random AoE ability the new trash pull flung at him.
---
Super edge.
---
I never played wow before, wow classic made me realize what i was missing
---
&gt;but I will need every drop in dungeons to build the gear I need
---
How the fuck is it ninjalooting if you actually need the gear?
---
I feel bad for our two proper guild tanks.
---
Everytime one of them logs on they get jumped by half the guild.
---
What class is best for both scenarios above? Hunter / Rogue?
---
I think bosses are best heard someone talk about it being 0.5% from the books (still havent seen one spawn)
---
He never said pup doesn't have use. You comment useless shit in like every thread. Suc can work just as pup, especially as deep destro.
---
I downvote every "I downvote every" post without reading.
---
Yes, including this one that I just made.
---
Meanwhile I followed my friends transferring off of Noggenfogger EU to Dragonfang EU. Dead for me especially cause I live in Japan and am 7 hours ahead.
---
Still has it's upsides, smaller pop means more close knit community.
---
Did you read the part about devayne?
---
That warning is generic.  If you do any /run macro (I do one for targeting I think I cant remember) it’s just warning you it’s possible to make a macro that deletes gold, etc.  sort of a warning to not get trolled into running something that deletes your stuff
---
Just curious, as swords on a single target what should my rotation look like while trying to keep slice and dice up but also use eviscerate as much as possible?
---
I often run into the same people doing dungeons, and I also add good tanks to my friend list. There really is a server community.
---
I downvote every comment downvoting me, without reading.
---
Excluding this one because i upvoted me.
---
You can’t use a mount unless you have the training for it, assuming it isn’t for your race, so selling the mount is completely pointless.
---
I've played in off an on for years. Much like WoW, many people only play the first 3 expansions. Project 1999 has hosted the game and first 3 expansions for almost a decade now and still has a healthy population. In fact, they're released another server in a few weeks.
---
Rogues is the least populated class on my server (PVE, obviously) on both factions.
---
Everyone wants them.
---
You have a point what should I call myself the needing samurai ?
---
How do you think they keep their huts clean? With a fucking broom?
---
This is bullshit.  My undead mage does a great deal of DPS.
---
Quel'Serrar
---
Horde or alliance?  I just came over with a small group and although the ratio was 3:1, I've had no trouble finding people to group with in the 20's.
---
Why is it the rational way, just because it's your way? I want gold so I'll start needing every drop, thx for the tips!
---
Learned how to heal? You click on the frame and press your heal button. Was it really that much of a learning process?
---
As a fellow fisherman, I let them do their thing. I also don't touch fellow rogues of the opposing faction.
---
For some servers maybe. It is showing Stalagg as majority Alliance which is way off. 
---
Way, way, WAY off.
---
Rogue adds a lot more to the group tbh. High burst and sustained dps. Stuns , CC, stealth runs, etc. 
---
But it is a sticky situation. Because people don't roll on ores or herbs in dungeons even though most are guarded or tethered to a mob.
---
Not CoD
---
sixtyupgrades.com and classic.wowhead.com/items are both good. they have recommended stat weights, or you can customize.
---
He means before it expires, not how long it takes to receive it.
---
Tl;dr - don't be a prick online and put some effort into getting better and your gaming experience will be enjoyable 
---
As for my .02, this is an excellent post and I'm happy to read about your positive experience. In the social media world it's very easy to get caught up in negativity. This was refreshing. 
---
Also, your online communication skills seem to be more than adequate. Keep it up!
---
Shadow priest here. Disagree it's super fun to be dpsing. There's still some pieces in raid to get not a ton but it's super enjoyable
---
Holy in the streets shadow in the sheets
---
Do you work or go to school? Don't take this as me being toxic towards you i'm just wondering how you manage to play that much.
---
I'd do the same if i could honestly.
---
There are plenty of people who still play retail. I hook up battlegrounds from time to time.
---
Would be easier to list the doors your can’t open as a rogue.
---
You don't Nova for damage. You Nova for the root so it doesn't really matter how much it does.
---
according to a large number of posters in the daily question thread, BoE epics in dungeons should be rolled Greed unless you are going to equip it. because greed is for gold and need is to equip.
---
no argument persuades them otherwise. if someone ninja's it, then just blacklist them and they'll build up a rep. -.-
---
i still don't understand that logic but there you go.
---
Classic is a bit more complicated than that. Things like burst DPS without reducing threat using things like feint can really make holding aggro difficult.
---
Also I ran with a group the other day (heals) where one of the DPS kept pulling mobs from a side hallway because he wanted to clear them for nodes.
---
So all of a sudden instead of fighting one pull we were fighting 3, and then when the tank died he kept yelling at me for my supposed trash heals. After the second time the DPS warrior pulled that stunt and I got yelled it the tank promptly kicked me while yelling at me for pulling mobs and then letting him die, even though it wasn’t my fault in the least. 
---
Point being that the DPS needs to have their shit figured out as well.
---
I played a Druid tank all throughout Wrath, tanked a few hardmode raids and was pretty good at it. My question is how different is Druid tanking in Classic compared to back then? I also haven't played since the very beginning of Cata if that matters.
---
I guess you could say I’m partially retired.
---
Only potential drawback would be if you have any macros that call out Bear Form as opposed to Dire Bear Form. Other than that, instant upgrade upon purchase.
---
It actually boggles my mind how people buy mounts (or anything) on the retail store. The sheer fact you're paying real life money for it completely erodes any desirabiity. When I used to play retail, and I'd see someone with a store mount, I wouldn't think "wow, awesome mount but shame it's on the store", I'd think something much less pleasant.
---
QS= [Quel'Serrar](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18348/quelserrar) 
---
its the sword in the picture
---
great job! i also rolled a tank orc shaman and by hitting 60 ive tanked everything apart from ubrs since its a 10 man and its actually easier than most 5 mans. what are your stats? by 60 i already had most of my bis and now i am sitting at 5100 armor and 3.4k health and about 330 defense. missing only my draconian deflector.
---
a tip is to buy those lesser stoneshield potions, super cheap and makes a difference
---
I'm only level 42. I wouldn't say I've lost interest, but I am doing other things too. Then I level a bit in Classic a couple of times a week when I get time. So I am definitely logged in less than the first week. Originally I had thought about having an alt, but I decided no to that this time around.
---
Hi (sorry for bad English)
---
It's pretty solid for resto shamans stacking mp5
---
Why? If you need a piece of loot because it's an upgrade, hit need. Yiu don't need to consult the party for that.
---
If it's for offspec i agree though, you kindly ask then.
---
Both retail and vanilla players talk shit about servers being dead.
---
full...on... rapist? I don't say it no good.
---
There is a winter spring frost Sabre Mount trainer in Winterspring- I thought at exalted you would be able to learn riding at her rather than having to get exalted with Darnassus as well? I could be wrong though ...
---
Don't forget the silk cloth scam!
---
Yes SnD and Evis as finishers, 5points for 25 energy from Relentless strikes.
---
Got her ring AND her 2h mace on my first run. Can tell you the other warrior and rogue were salty
---
You say thanks by paying it forward when you are able to do so. Know what I mean?
---
a few issues:
---
1. You can't tell if the person who 'needs' the item already has it in their bags and has just equipped that.
---
2. you needed the group to get the drop - if it wasn't for the group, you wouldn't have seen the drop. Therefore, the group has equal 'right' to the drop
---
ok that's 2 but im busy atm
---
oh ye, brilliant idea!
---
they are just afk. they are not playing just forgot to log out after doing their 20 min weekly raid
---
Which class makes the best tank besides warrior? I wanna tank but warrior seems monotonous
---
I camped Humar the Pridelord as a Night Elf back when I started in 2006 for 3 weeks because I wanted a lion, and the black lion skin looked cooler with a Night Elf. Was kind of a bummer when they added the black lion for a quest in Sholazar Basin during Wrath; made Humar less unique.
---
Tl;dr tame what you want
---
Hopefully they take some notes for whatever they have planned.
---
You have clearly never tanked. It takes time to get aggro. If DPS starts nuking before tank has aggro, tank doesn't get hit, then doesn't get enough rage to take aggro back.
---
Personally i recon doing a ghost mushroom, gizlock, princess would be more consistant. On my lock, starting at purple entrance i can get to and kill princess in 15 mins, getting me 5-6 ghost mushrooms plus boss loot, between 10-15 gold per run depending on what drops off bosses.
---
Keep SND up, you'll have a huge DPS boost. A lot of your damage comes from auto attacks and poison / WF procs.
---
Hey do you happen to have a source for this?
---
Admitting to a TOS violation and saying something nice about retail WoW in the same breath? Enjoy the downvote storm.
---
That's awesome man!!
---
It seems like you're getting destroyed by everyone while projecting your failures in life onto them, lol. 
---
Since all your comments got removed from the other thread, ill put my final reply to your nonsense here (since I already typed it):
---
Nice reply, I guess when historical facts come to the table you have nowhere to go but respond with a nonsensical one liner. Thanks for showcasing how mentally deficient you are.
---
Also, first time I see someone argue that context and etymology is 'fake news'. Nah, you're the delusional one here bud. And extremely ignorant and dumb as well. 
---
And oh, in your attempt to be edgy you spelled it wrong as well, lmao. What a sad failure, get a brain transplantion bud.
---
Has there been a world first world pvp Faction Leader kill yet? With all the world firsts that people raced to after Classic dropped, I haven't heard that so-and-so guild downed Thrall first etc. Or is no one bothering until the honor system?
---
is this something specific only to druids?
---
I have never done it but if you have an efficient way to heal your lowbie then I would go for it. By that I mean if you can heal on the higher level toon while spending most of your time on the leveler while attacking mobs a level or 2 higher then that has to be the way to go. Screw quests. Just grind mobs.
---
But even then pulling the lower level toon through dungeons they barely qualify to get in seems like a good way to get gear to kill those higher level mobs faster.
---
PvE servers are just not that popular as most people don't only like just taking on the AI.
---
I think he means that 'articulate' specifically refers to the fluency of spoken language. As such, it doesn't really fit the context. Well-writted might be more suitable. 
---
His comment is kinda dickish though.
---
Mained a druid in vanilla. During BC I rolled a pally and had to go back and get one.
---
There are lfg addons that gives u UI to search for group or ad your group for heal/tank/dps automatically, even replies to whispers n stuff
---
.
---
Uldum was actually a great zone. The questing zones in cata were pretty neat. So was the first raidtier. Firelands and DS...Firelands had some great bossfights but was short as hell...DS...no....just no...
---
You're the person I'm talking to I guess. It's your job to not pull aggro. If you do, it's your fault.
---
Unfortunately the barman shanker can be detrimental. In PvE it takes up a debuff slot for your raid. In PvP it can interrupt your blinds and certain stuns.
---
If it’s red, it’s dead
---
It's actually https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Rune_of_Portals, the teleport one is for a self-port. Honestly, anyone that would do this probably wouldn't want anything (though I like the idea of sending a thank-you note). Sometimes it just feels good to help someone- and the mage got a good story out of it, too.
---
It’s probably because he likes to role play a bit.
---
Ugh. You win this one.
---
I love ringmenu!
---
What a pathetic life you must live. I hope one day you work that out one way or another.
---
Just googled the vulpine familiar, looks gay AF
---
Heartseeker is high pop, when I joined it was "New" thinking I'd have a nice low pop experience...lol...btw this game rules it's really no surprise unless you have no taste.
---
Also the only place to get the chimera meat for the one cooking recipe
---
Do you even know what bloatware is? Your comment stinks of "I have this negative opinion because I read stuff online about stuff".
---
I'm a 56 rogue, so this might not apply to warriors.
---
My 40-50 felt really slow. Like really slow. Maybe 3 weeks irl time. But I've gotten 50-56 in 7 irl days.  I think once you hit 50 you'll find the same. Leveling is much more enjoyable when 60 is right around the corner and you're grinding your pre raid bis at the same time. Everything matters more.
---
Lol where did your post go?
---
xD
---
She freaks out during her third phase and our paladin tank usually picks her up first. Besides, she’s immune to taunts, so the usual downside of pally tanks isn’t important.
---
Running but not swimming :0
---
Warrior is actually very intuitive, with Rage management, stance dancing etc
---
As for other tanks viability, Im not sure, Druid tanking works i suppose, but not as good as Warrior for endgame tanking
---
*Laughs in pve*
---
Paladin. I really liked the way Classic Judgment system sounded and I've always loved auras and blessings. PvP healing on Pally has been a blast imo.
---
My only regret I guess you could say is that Dwarves can't have Shaman but I kinda like that quirk about Classic. Wouldn't have it any other way.
---
From what I can tell it's mostly Warriors that are MT and Druids are just OTing. Bears are just considered second to Warriors at tanking
---
LOL
---
By the time you're foing LBRS you should know to dismiss your pet while fucking around with skips and whatnot though.
---
The one in disc is for all priest spells and the one in shadow is for offensive spells. Ill have to go back and check to see if it counts just healing.
---
Not 100% sure if their effects stack though, if they do it's probably wise to get both.
---
1: Guides are wrong, you still get knocked back even if you are targeted.
---
2: Yes. You spread groups of two around, that way only two people ever get knocked back. That way, you get to minimize the amount of people getting knocked back and taking damage from that mechanic. You don't stack people to avoid knockbacks entirely, but rather for the reason I just described.
---
I played with a shammy the other day who thought it was the dogs DPS bollox. Wouldn't wait for tank to get aggro before unloading his burst of DPS. He was 3 levels higher than us. We ended up takijg 4 hours to do brd(and not finishing) got through 4 bosses and wiped atleast a dozen times. Tank had to go off and repair twice looooool. All because this over eager dick of a shammy would take aggro and run around like a moron and cause chaos
---
Still layered. And it's still lame
---
*spoken in computer voice*
---
Depends on how big the server is. At the very least being in a guild means you know when the scheduled raid is going to be so you don't miss out
---
ty
---
The weekends probably have more classic players than retail players
---
I had something like this happen with me (priest) and a bear Druid going from Redridge to Westfall. Instantly recognized him in general chat and he recognized me back from when we were both farming murlocs. Experiences like that are super cool and make the game so social even for a quiet person.
---
Thank you I appreciate it much.
---
I think it was a joke
---
Clear everything, no excuses. More gear, loot, mats and xp if you still need that. Besides its fun to successively pull off clean pulls and maintain when shit goes south. 
---
My only note of worth is that there are far less bad players around this time. Most of my time wasted was dealing with crazies.
---
Because they're mostly tryhards that salivate and unzip their pants whenever their favorite streamers release a new YouTube video showing off how they too can finally git gud for once
---
It went on Reddit. You were there when it happened right?
---
This and barrens chat
---
I just never knew! I’m not on a lot so only level 20 atm. Seems a good wow to get mount gold
---
Right, Taunt doesn't exist in this game, forgot about that.
---
It’s been removed
---
Guess you didn’t want to stand behind that?
---
It must your fault
---
Hope it's TBC. It's my favorite expansion and is the only one to hold my attention all the way through!
---
But I've a feeling Blizzard will follow RuneScape's, Ultima's, and EverQuest's formulas and just tack new content on, essentially making a WoW Rehash. It's not an entirely bad idea, but at the same time it would basically just be another new expansion. 
---
Blizzard's best bet if they were to take that route is to just entirely reforge WoW for its next expansion so that it's much more vanilla-like (basically make it appealing) and either leave Classic alone, shut it down, or run TBC
---
If I'm nice to you RNGsus might be nice to me. I love your hair today, have a great tuesday and I hope you choke on your food you damn lootluckf***k!
---
I dunno, the private unofficial servers are still running, why not Classic.
---
It's obviously going to die off at some stage.
---
I farm elemental fire in un'goro. On Wednesdays the price of greater fire protection potion skyrocket on my server. Last week I sold the ones I had for 9g each. Its at least 70g/h for me with herbing silversage around the mountain and essence of fire taken into the calculation. I also buy cheap elemental fire during the week if its 5g or lower. Just have to hold on the materials for a week before selling. I also do a few herb laps around epl and Azshara to get dream foil and plaguebloom, so I can make elixir of the mongoose aswell. If you don't have alchemy, just ask a guildmate:)
---
Hah, as a non-native Dutch speaker I have the opposite experience: small sentences and conversations are easy, but typing out something as big as the above post would take me a very long time because I'll see every little mistake (and often not quite know how to fix it).
---
Writing formal emails to school etc... argh, I need to set aside a quiet hour.
---
"Good" at aoe does not indicate a good player.
---
A valuable lesson that blows right through the empty heads of most mages.
---
If you don't trust everyone in the group, roll need.  It's simple.
---
"It's my BiS" is not an excuse because there's no BiS worth it's salt listing only a .2% chance drop item.  So effectively guy you don't trust wants a very expensive item that is just slightly better than a BoP drop......
---
We've all seen people need then just don't equip or leave group.
---
I didn't remove it so you must know something I don't. I'll just keep posting it I guess since it's true.
---
Where do I find the fishing spots? I had a look around and never saw any. Got any pointers?
---
My face in the toilet after I had chipotle.
---
It's called game design silly! /jk
---
I still wanna play the Russia Roulette with you guys ;-)
---
Dudi's everywhere.
---
I won money with 7. After 150 runs im very thankful there were no huntards to take it this time.
---
Nice link man, thanks!
---
In terms of people I know IRL, it seems like there's been a ~50% drop since launch. That's definitely less than my personal estimate of 75% by the time renewal rolls around.
---
As a warlock I am very thankful for that one stack of food
---
What sort of addon do you have where Dreamscythe Says that?
---
Shadow priests deserve more respect!!
---
“I’m bad and die while raiding, so everyone else must be the same!”
---
Makes lots of sense
---
Pretty sure the only time I wouldn't give food/water to anyone is if I felt like they'd kick me for not doing so - i'd just leave.
---
The content is fairly easy, so I'd rather take 45 mins to find a group that isn't gonna be dramatic about little details and have a pleasant run.
---
How does that work?
---
Stv isn't great to level in due to the constant ganking, and it is frustrating doing it alone (I did as well).
---
Are you horde or alliance? There may be other zones more enjoyable! And at your level you should be able to do ZF soon
---
Hey hey, take that back. I 've never teabagged a corpse more than 3 dips.
---
They can both trigger the sword specialization proc, but your offhand's damage is so gimped that it hardly matters. Honestly though while leveling nothing really matters and I'd advise you to pick whichever looks cooler.
---
If the make or break for you is highest efficiency, then yes grab the dagger for your offhand. Offhand's are primarily for applying poison unless you've gotten dual wield specialization, and even then you still want a fast one when possible
---
Aaaah ok, that explains it.  
---
I thought base cost is 900 and minus 10% = 810.  
---
Cheers!
---
There’s so many people that Ironforge is lagging. And that’s the real Classic experience.
---
ok that makes sense.  
---
cheers
---
Linking items is super helpful on reddit.
---
Nonetheless
---
2.2 speed sword goes mainhand
---
1.9 speed sword goes offhand
---
Replace mainhand whenever you get a slower sword for that has more dps. Then 2.2 sword in offhand as it’s better overall for a rogue.
---
Ok, good to know. Do you have any link ? It doesn t really change anything but it s interesting.
---
I'm saying now that if the game is dead in 6 months no one here will claim they said it would keep thriving.
---
yeah and taunts never get resisted
---
Why would blizzard do something? Sorry about your poor planning.
---
Works wonders if you arr semi-afk at work or something.  You can just alt tab over to spam your macro/respond to tells and then craft em all up at once while afk
---
I'll say it until it's a meme at this point. Censorship is not my thing.
---
If you are depressed, just don't be sad.
---
That’s a good point, changed my mind on it. Mages give water. Everyone else gives buff and so on.
---
In*elegant* but great reference . One of most used.
---
I don't play an AoE mage, it's boring to me and just not my playstyle and the amount of whispers I get every day it's insanely annoying to the point where I just don't respond anymore.
---
I don't agree, wipes happen because of primal people's flight instinct kicking in and them running like headless chickens, usually mages and locks.
---
Just stand still, hope the tank gets aggro back or take your deserved death, but NEVER panic run.
---
sorry amigo. you set the loot rules, he followed them.
---
Did you just take a photo of your monitor? You need help!
---
Thanks for the response :) 
---
This is exactly what I'm looking for. I'm planning a 20/31/0 for good hybrid options just trying to figure out gear. That build seems like the easiest "generalist" set to form I like it
---
Literally WeirdChamp
---
We did it with 4 clothies before, although decently raid geared. Our warlock usually got aggro and had a high enough health pool to survive (with priest shield and I assume, sacced void). Well, except for Krastinov, there he had to get lucky to get the aggro drop instead of a bad crit, it was about 50:50. High enough damage really does trivialize most of those fights.
---
TAKE MY DOWN VOTE!
---
Well, maybe you can learn to use commas, and some grammar during your time off.
---
My post has been deleted once already. u/torbtorb1 mocked me when it happened even and I'm not really sure how they knew so quick.
---
DPS without dieing was always a pride thing for me. Noob DPS just can't handle their role I guess.
---
I always tell shadow priests at the end of the dungeon that their efforts are worthy of respec. I don't know why they always get mad at me.
---
in the end of the day its a game and u had bad luck
---
Lessons learned the hard way
---
Every dungeon I've done people roll or take turns on Ore/Herbs.
---
It's really not a sticky situation. It's a social game, and if you want to be greedy people will remember. Rogue's aren't mandatory, so they will just find themselves invited less if they behave that way.
---
Can't taunt multiple targets every pull. Also, with some bad luck still doesn't give enough time to get aggro back if DPS still nukes
---
I think it is not that they released DM per se, but more that they said they were going follow a plan how they would release content and then they immediatly broke their word on only some slight perceived pressure. Can we really trust that they follow their plan in the future? Personally I am not bothered, but this is the argument, not that DM broke something.
---
I'm about to buy a Biznicks scope for my Rhok Delar. Can anyone confirm that it's working correctly? I read some comments about the hit not showing up in addons, but don't know if that's accurate.
---
&gt;I reported him because I think this is ninja looting even if he use it or not.
---
So you reported him for following the loot rules you set?
---
what is this fort?
---
It’s still so highly populated that we’re fighting for quest mobs or items. Of course some people were just curious and went beck to something easier. I for one am glad they did.
---
I played a warrior so I'd get gangbanged to death by rumblers if I tried to run away dazed .. ended up getting stacks of essences while people complaining about getting 1 essence an hour and I'm there killing one mob at a time surrounded by mages probably feeling sorry for me
---
But for real, nothing like finding a chill comfortable camp for a few days/ handful of levels that you rarely see others walking through. Except those pitiful 60s that just enjoy ganking, but that's the way she goes.
---
Its stupid that you reported him. Its stupid that you think this is ninja looting. Youre stupid for putting loot on free for all. Im glad he got the Edgemasters Gauntlets and not you.
---
WAT U SAY I SPEAK AMERICAN
---
This is correct.
---
I know this is not the “what should I play thread” but that one is not on front page anymore so I might as well ask here. 
---
So the question is what should I play as my second character? I’m a warrior currently and looking for a less meta class but still useful. So no mage/priest/rouge suggestions pls. 
---
Was thinking of paladin, since I want to play something that does damage but can heal too or a shaman. They booth seemed quite the complicated class where you have to know a lot of how to play just to keep up with other meta classes. So maybe a warlock, it doesn’t seem to be as popular as the other classes (at least not on my server)  but still have pretty good damage. 
---
What would you guys recommend, and how would you rate the difficulty of the class?
---
You can get away with raiding as either spec. Deep Fury is what most people raid as for dps though.
---
Sad. Putting him on ignore is probably the only thing you can do about it.
---
When stuff like this happens, ill ask the group im in to disband at third wipe.
---
What level would you recommend starting LBRS at?
---
ElvisRezMe  
---
Priest/Paladin
---
Somebody named Cinn has me on ignore and I don't recall ever seeing the dude. Like what did I do random stranger!?!?
---
People being dumb are what these scams rely on.
---
As a mage, I grinded 10 essences of air and decided it would be much faster to grind gold and just buy them.
---
Such bullshit.
---
To be honest when I heard shadow priests could solo Princess Theradras I was very intrigued
---
the noty?
---
as in "First, Second, and Third orbs are reserved for me and that's naughty" - noty?
---
Sorry for your loss- but you are out of luck. You set the loot type as FFA, so that is the rule that applies. It might have been nice if the warrior had brought the item up for a roll- but he was under no obligation to do so. All you can do is mark it down as a lesson learned.
---
It's also very good to have to drink with the mages while the priest is at 80% mana and your melee(s) are ready to go for another 3 packs.
---
why not both? run LGS til the proc then swap in thrash blade. good times.
---
Primary customers? Do they pay extra much, or do I miss something?
---
“I already equipped”
---
MANY people played classic for BGS and world PVP. 
---
Those who played for bgs and found out they wont be here for 3-4 months cancelled subs and are waiting to come back. Others are waiting for word on when the honor system is going to be here, because for all we know the earliest might be the end of december at the last rumors. 
---
But REGARDLESS... Look at how many people play now. Guilds are alive, zones are full, cities are flooded. 
---
New phases shit is gunna be like launch week all over again
---
X is kill second, square is usually sap, sleep, or banish, and all the others vary depending on your group. Those 4 are by far the most commonly used that people will expect you to know without explanation, though.
---
They do this in ZF. So when someone has to run back they inevitably aggro every mob. I just... We need the xp anyway?!
---
It introduced dungeon finders which changed the game quite a lot.
---
It also got rid of the tiered raid progression in tbc and classic.
---
It was the start of the game being changed to what it currently is on retail.
---
Maybe I am biased but classic and tbc were great for their time. Wotlk is the first time I unsubscribed from wow due to losing interest in the game. Maybe I was playing the game for too long at that point or maybe the game changed a lot during that expansion.
---
He's the type that opens trade with you and says nothing. People charge him because he's annoying.
---
Fucking amazing how these scams still work... 
---
They are shitty for preying on the uninitiated, preying on that sense of good will.
---
Which weapons are you talking about for example? Asking for a friend..
---
I just figured blocking is a big threat generator so redoubt would be important. 
---
Deathbone / lightforge &gt; raid T1 is an easy list to remember
---
I'm gonna go ahead and blame zoomers, but that's probably not the answer
---
This is honestly the *best* reason to be a Tank. These interactions are so much less frequent as DPS, I always miss it.
---
Trust is Earned, Not Given as such you should not ever use FFA or trade crafting materials of too high a value.
---
Thank you and I’ll see you in game
---
I feel like my guild is finally going s pretty decent (hopefully positive) reputation too.
---
Yeah I don't get it either, you're saying he types well...
---
Or more respeck
---
It also doesnt have to be enormously rammed to be a success. My server in eu is busy as anything regardless so all good on both fronts
---
Cities were raided on the first week of classic. Faction leaders aren't very tough to take down, so people don't really bother posting "world first" stuff for them.
---
I
---
there's 2H from DM, live strat, and rend that are close. treant's bane, doomsaw, demonshear, even barbara's blade isn't terrible.
---
Epic
---
I'm not a particularly good tank (mainly because I'm spoiled by my healer guildies who are all absolute legends) but I'm the type who de-escalates tension with dumb, self deprecating jokes. It's always nice having people asking after runs to add each other, especially after those scuffed Scholomances with multiple wipes.
---
I think the entire playerbase being 15 years older has made Azeroth a much more pleasant place to live in.
---
bro, spellcleave is a noob trap, join a melee group and you will be praised just for existing
---
No it's not good at all for warlocks, I would understand healers being upset over it. Locks have lifetap which benefits from sp. mp5 is garbage for us.
---
This is incorrect
---
**Horde - EU - Gehennas - PvP**
---
Rogue pretty much prebis lf guild. Cannot raid on sunday evenings!
---
More info can be provided on request :)
---
Axe from angerforge if orc, sword from balnazzar if human. Also 4.0 speed weapon from rare boss in LBRS.
---
I made arcanite reaper for myself anyway, it is the best
---
How much damage do you manage without dots? Are you allowed to put any? How much do you spend on Mana pots for a raid?
---
Classic will be fine for at least a year after AV. After that, who knows. There definitely have been a significant number of unsubs due to HongKong and players who expected it to be cooler to them than it was. I already unsubbed, but i see the draw for lots of players and have a few days left.
---
If we all take notice, i havent seen a q times past 2 minutes in awhile. Odds are in the next few months probably half the playerbase will leave, but being tied to wow subs it will always have stragglers popping in and out. 
---
Even with half its players it should be in a fine place.
---
that's a legitimate point, and now I too am worried
---
You set the loot rules and then complain about those exact loot rules?
---
“Google me, I was world top 10 back in the day blah blah subscribe to my Twitch stream”
---
2H warrior in PvE is just enough off the meta that it could be a subtle way to get that unique feels without main change.
---
Shadow priest, the pure double-take anti-meta class.
---
Warlock has awesome utility and is generally somewhat less common class.
---
Ret is the middle finger to the meta.
---
Taking someone's bis because it's a minor upgrade for you is not the most considerate thing. Which, as a warlock taking an mp5 ring, that's probably the situation.
---
Let's say you're a hunter running LBRS trying to get Blackcrow. It drops, but the rogue (who already has Satyr's bow) sees that it's technically a minor dps upgrade. He needs it and wins, and you have to keep on using your garbage green.
---
Yeah that's an extreme situation, but the point is that if I were the hunter I would be justifiably salty.
---
How do I use these timers? Is there a guide to understand what it does exactly? ;-)
---
I usually mark the mobs for the tanks if the dps are being idiots.
---
Have you tried playing in the daytime? This game is clearly dieing.
---
It’s mainly because your tanking dungeons while leveling. I added every decent tank to friends I leveled with. Most all interactions died at 60. Glhf buddy
---
Nice. But i meant instagram reposters not you :) ı don’t think i saw this accounts.
---
LoL!
---
Don't fucking worry man, if the mage is as cool as you described a simple "Thanks" will suffice.
---
Also... RFC is in Org 6_6... in that purple crag area. Wait... is it still purple in Retail? 
---
You got super pranked.
---
Just get good and be a legend, people who help out newbies usually do it out of a sense of satisfaction, justice  and or under the impression that assisting others helps keep the game alive.
---
I reckon it's the latter, afterall... if no one helped you you'd probably have rage quit.
---
Druid maintanking depends on the boss, really. Unless Shield Wall is needed, druids are generally stronger tanks in all regards in current gear levels.
---
I kind of get how you feel but the opposite events. Some spell hit item came up from Arena and it would have been an upgrade for me (a healer who doesn't need spell hit) just based on the stats but passed for the warlock just so that later, the lock can instantly need the trinket from Ambassador that's good for both of us when I hadn't picked up any loot from the run at that point. Just feels bad when you try to do something nice and they don't reciprocate.
---
Jesus Christ!
---
First week of MC, or 1st week on server. I assumed it to be the latter from OPs comment
---
“Washyerback”
---
I don't think you understand what running a dungeon 20 times for a specific item and then losing it to someone who will replace it in a week anyway feels. It's in your own best interest to be courteous when it comes to bis items...
---
Wrong
---
Dude, you can’t report others for the mistakes YOU make... you sound like a spoiled brad
---
If you want a class that can heal or do damage don't discount druids, being able to heal, tank, dps, and having stealth makes for a fun class. You won't be topping dps or heal charts but the ability to switch roles is certainly fun.
---
Alliance druid or paladin, or horde shaman would all be fun choices for a second character.
---
 I can't really comment on warlock, but they are good for pvp against mages and warriors which are the 2 most commonly played classes.
---
Wow those are awful, my server was doing 57 to double, 98 to triple.
---
Why did you just decide to have a wank in the middle of this sub
---
Exactly my thought!
---
I think I might not have phrased myself correctly (apologies, English is not my first language). My question was not as much towards MH as for OH (I do understand how sinister strike works based off of Weapon damage on MH)  
---
Taking these two weapons:  
---
 [https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=6831](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=6831)    
---
 [https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=6829](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=6829)   
---
and this build :  
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fZG0Ez0Vzxdo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fZG0Ez0Vzxdo)   
---
(wowhead is under maintenance)  
---
Which would be more beneficial as OH -&gt; the faster dagger with shadow damage proc, or the slightly slower sword with higher DMG (Not DPS)
---
I'm mentally ill and I would NEVER tell someone to kill themselves
---
You should never attack mobs from the front, ever.  Parry reduces your DPS and increases the damage the tank is taking.
---
They tried to kill it by suppressing freedom of speech.
---
Damn. Seems impossible to get that in a pug. Maybe I will try it sometime. One of the last pieces of gear I need is DM west
---
Ideally, you want two swords. Sword spec procs off any direct damage from a sword. This includes: mh autos, offhand autos, ss, eviscerate, wf procs, hoj procs.
---
The reason you want a slow mh is for the higher damage for ss (obviously dps being equal, slower weapons hit harder). The reason you want a fast offhand sword is to get more offhand swings to proc poisons and sword spec. Ideally you'd want a 2.7ish sword mainhand, 1.5ish sword offhand. All of that being said, do your best. If you have drastic damage or dps upgrades while leveling, go with it.
---
I wouldn't argue that, but druids are still normally given OT positions
---
Most players dont even hit 60 in a month. Only hardcore fans. There has been a incredibly large drop in player counts and it is still shrinking rather than getting bigger. That said, it should be fine till probably a year after AV drops.
---
Do you have dual wield specialization? If yes, go swords. If no, go sword + dagg.
---
Slow mainhand sword, fast offhand sword/dagger.
---
Probly being removed for your witch hunting there. Take a hint
---
Why can't we have nice things...
---
It can get you up on the charts but if you understand your class it isn't necessary. Number one is a hard spot to keep, number 2 or 3 is easy.
---
Try this:
---
Right click on your chat tab at the top. You should see a menu pop up. At the bottom of the menu you will see "settings"- click on that. The window that pops up should have a button at the bottom that says "chat defaults"- click on that. You should get a popup that says this will reset you to default settings- click accept.
---
That should do it- if not there are other things you can do- but try that first.
---
Except if it's a Dwarf Priest, be whatever, shadow, frost priest, who cares, we just need an extra fear ward.
---
*leaves*
---
*takes my healer gf*
---
looks great aside from the map.
---
You could make it use-able tho by macro/addon setting up those abilities so that they change based upon chosen target and if alone / grp or raid, you should maybe add a threat meter addon tho, but anyways it looks great.
---
You should get the addon T-RP3 so you get the rp element into it and people can inspect to read it :)
---
I'd like to see that too.
---
I just don't understand what they are supposed to do.
---
Brah! Just equip them.
---
People don’t give a shit if they can see it’s not for profit.
---
They wont answer. Even the busy servers have only a small q during peek hours now. I bet half the base already unsubbed. That said, i think 10% 0f players will probably stay on till at least AV
---
Your opinion reveals a lack of parenting.
---
Love that he deleted his reddit account.

What's the least "guild-reliant" class? Meaning, due to my schedule, I won't be able to run a consistent schedule with a guild for raids/grinding gear, so I'll have to rely on solo leveling and PUGs for dungeons (and most likely raids).
---
What class will have the easiest time without an organized guild?
---
do moon and square generally mean to cc the target?
---
only a handful of guilds per server will be getting world bosses
---
We have a dagger rogue. Hes topping the meters.

---
Get over it, you suck at tanking
---
Lol wtf, a mage rolling on a +healing trinket is absolutely a reason for flaming
---
Clear enough, Thanks dude.
---
While you are right in most engagements, there are exceptions.
---
Some encounters will drop aggro or have random DPS to the group there are also a few where the tank get CC'ed.
---
Dats small! Also best part is:
---
"Which way?"
---
"No idea lol"
---
Shaman single target aggro is instane, the problem is tanking multiple mobs. You can literally take aggro off a warrior whenever you like. Rockbiter + earthshock does insane threat.
---
When you play levelup with melee, you cannot use those at ALL. You will have aggro for sure.
---
&gt; tanks started being entitled pricks: kicking low dps
---
I remember something similar during wotlk (so I think it was BEFORE the LFG system). I was in a group and three of the players in the group were from the same guild. One of the players (the tank I believe) was getting really angry that my DPS was so low (I was a demonology specced lock at the time) and kept yammering on about it through the entire dungeon. I was used to soloing much of the world content and was more used to a slow burn approach, so I didn't know how to maximize my damage with a tank who wouldn't lose agro, along with a healer present. Most of my gameplay up to that point had been: DoT up, then drain life, then reapply dots. Also dot everything. I wasn't able to keep my damage numbers to what the tank wanted and I had to put up with this nonsense all through the dungeon. It wasn't as though we COULDN'T clear the dungeon, but there were 1 or 2 achievements they'd wanted to do but were unable to because I couldn't provide enough DPS.
---
I'd imagine with the LFG system it's gotten a LOT worse. My buddy who stopped playing WoW (probably permanently) was showing his nephew how to play WoW Classic and he told me he was shocked by just how friendly the community was. Personally I stopped playing WoW towards the end of wotlk (though even then, I was not someone who engaged in end game content), so I don't know how the community turned out. When I saw the classic community and the way folks were, I thought this was the norm, my buddy (and this subreddit) all however tell me that actually the retail community has become extremely toxic.
---
Good job!
---
Feels pretty balanced to me.
---
I'm pretty sure either spec can make money just as well as the other for warrior so they don't really run into that issue.
---
Ah yes, checking this sub twice a day is really taking a toll on my personal life I can't believe I was so blind,you're right. My wife took the kids and left, I got fired from my job, so much happened in those 30 minutes my life is over.
---
Damn, sorry to hear about you getting camped. I’m on Stalaag horde and honestly hate the imbalanced ratio. Really wished all the alliance didn’t transfer out. Let me know what servers you have in mind in terms of balance.
---
Lol, I had to do 143 runs in order to drop it 😅😰
---
400iq move right there
---
Play what ever you like. Play a crab if you want to. Right now I have an ugly carrion bird. OK hands off, it's not the worst pet, but I don't see it that often. Back in wotlk or cata I think, I played a monkey. Doesn't matter which pet you choose. But it does matter how much you enjoy the game
---
famle dwarf shaman even rarer
---
 prat even changes shaman to blue mmmkay
---
Something about trying to talk in chat while thanking makes me brain dead. If I have the opportunity to spend a while proofreading and putting thought into a post, I can spin some nice paragprags. On the other hand, while I'm trying to hold aggro, I talk like I've just had a stroke.
---
Who is that warrior and why is he me?
---
IS THIS MY FURUTE AND I'M GONNA GET ISEKAID TO AZEROTH AS A FORSAKEN???!!!
---
"That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Skeleton With Zombie Parts" sounds like an interesting title. X,D
---
Personally I never used one.  
---
I also never really attempted the "run away and wait" tactic, because of leeway or something mobs could hit me 10m away from them anyway (well, I'm a Tauren...) so the only thing I would have gotten out of it, would have been adds...
---
Because of the horrible attack speed on Impervious Giant. The only class that really has much use for it is a druid, since it's a fairly good stat stick for cat.
---
As a melee DPS, you have to consider the weapons damage range, on top of it's stats. Purely for the thought experiment, a weapon that does 50 DPS with a damage range of 100-150 will typically end up doing less damage than a weapon with 45 DPS and a range of 150-200, purely because of instant strikes.
---
I wouldn't call this a bad experience at all man, you got to experience both ends of the spectrum in 3 hours and came out of it with an epic tale of deception, adventure, hard-ship and finally compassion. This is what classic is.
---
I wouldn’t consider this a ninja loot, you set the rules to FFA afterall, regardless if you was helping him out and thought you was doing him a favour, it was a risk and he isn’t entitled to give you anything, could of happened either way around and unfortunately it wasn’t in your favour
---
Just remember next time you group up, I’ve never been a FFA fan because I fear these kind of situations
---
I'd have to go with my favorite class, Shaman. Some of the strongest group/raid healing (if not the strongest), although the healing spells are quite limited in number. You're looking at 1 cooldown for oh-shit-moments when instant heals are required, one spell for saving low HP targets quickly, your big regular heal for tank healing and the most iconic heal you get, Chain heal for raid healing. To this you add a multitude of totems, of which you will probably use 5-6 during your regular raid boss - but you have an additional 7-8 that will see situational and niche use. Plus your 6s CD interrupt and enemy Magic dispel and built-in kiting kit. Your bread-and-butter totem, WF, in 5mans and melee raid groups can boost melee DPS by \~10-15%, and your Mana sprint totem (talented) provides 12 mp5 to you and your group and Mana Tide from deep resto restores 1290 mana IIRC to you and the rest of your group - not an insignificant amount if you're placed in the healer group. 
---
While Enhancement won't be topping the meters in raids, there is still usually a spot since they can boost melee DPS further by talenting their Windfury and Strength of Earth totems to provide greater boosts to AP and Str, and they are quite good candidates for wielding a Nigthfall and proccing its debuff for the spellcasters in the raid. Can get some damn nice numbers when WF decides to proc back to back, and pretty fun to play solo.
---
Ele does very competitive DPS in 5mans, but falls short on longer fights due to lack of (mana) longevity. Also horribly nerfed DPS versus targets that are immune to Nature damage, as their whole kit (or 90%) revolves around Lightning &amp; Chain Lightning. You could perhaps opt for a 30(ele)/0/21(resto) hybrid build and be effective as a 5man dungeon healer and OKish raid healer if you pop consumables diligently, while retaining some solo and dungeon capability. You might want some gear for it to work though, since you are giving up quite a bit of mana efficiency doing so.
---
GW2 has world challenges that *require* parkour, you're EXPECTED to shimmy along edges and jump onto tiny platforms. If you fail, you're doing it all over again from the beginning. The game tracks your progress by having...orbs I think? Orbs you need to tap to get your final reward (and you can tap them in any order).
---
The game has a LOT of things for you to do, and rewards it all. Explored every area on a map? Here's a gift box! Did the jumping challenge? Gift box! Found every waypoint? Gift box! Did the daily challenge of collecting ore you were going to collect anyway? Gift box!
---
There’s a limit to how many resets you can do in an hour. If you’re outside the instance it simply won’t let you in.  If you’ve logged out to reset with an alt, it sends you to your hearth instead.
---
Yes
---
Now I know who ganked me. And he vapes catnip too.
---
Get everything that way you will always be prepared.
---
I am playing a gnome, and like to pretend I am the bobber. The reactions is very different. Most of the time people laugh. But I have encountered some hostile persons who immediately killed me 😅
---
I saw this same sight yesterday and I honestly felt moved by the sheer number of people. This is what classic’s about
---
&gt;Fun part is he whispered me later on to join his group. Several times.
---
Im sure hes just using some addon that does spam messages.
---
I don’t think you offended anyone necessarily, people don’t get offended when flamed by douchebags.
---
Classic is also a reminder of how bad game design and piss poor decisions dragged otherwise great games down in the past :)
---
You're literally calling someone out by name which is witch hunting my man, feel free to witch hunt me too
---
Yeah, that's what we assumed and seems to be true. Guy I originally commented on claimed they '100% drop the threat of anyone they hit to 0' I thought it was him replying sorry
---
Twitter snowflakes is WoW I guess?
---
Maybe there is an addon that auto ignores people and they have it on the wrong settings being forever confused why nobody replies to them? X,D
---
What level are you?
---
What is found in this tomes? Sorry newb question
---
Nah it’s just there isn’t a huge amount of content left if you’ve got to 60, got your epic mount and started the gearing in MC. 
---
Once P2 comes out you can expect numbers similar to launch again.
---
People being AFK in a city = game is alive and "not dead" ? Love that logic ^^ But Classic will be alive and well forever, private servers have been a thing for over 10+ years
---
If you get sick, next time you should try not getting sick, see if that helps.
---
Gnome mages pretty much just run around and arcane explosion lowbies. I had one camping the kaya escort on the road in stonetalon just to mess with lvl 20s...
---
I got the robes of Insight purple BoE drop on my mage in ZF, I got kicked by my salty group and they spammed on all chats about how I was a ninja and for the next couple days I recieved several toxic /w's. Next run I won a greed roll on another purple BoE, karma.
---
Human rogues.
---
Too many bad DPS don't know how to manage threat.
---
Nah savage glad chain is epic and that's from the arena.
---
Rattlegore?
---
Up them rates bruh thats peanuts
---
Don’t transfer there. It’s terrible.
---
He was going to thunderbluff to pick up quests :)
---
As a holy priest - why?
---
Yeah I can’t wait to not have that underlying guilt of not being productive.
---
I just want to mess around in the world.
---
I'm 60 and the only thing I'm still using is the Ravager from time to time, so I'd say go for that.
---
Imagine doing it in RL!
---
Well people do have some form of reputations again, and Horde going after bad rep Alliance is an interesting way to do faction conflict
---
It most certainly is. Taurens are people who think that 5% hp will make ANY difference at all. So misguided people.
---
Is this fnny? Yawn dude
---
Yeah DPS's job is to manage their threat. If they would just wait and watch the tank before attacking they can still top the damage meters.
---
Seems somewhat consistent. From the times I've tanked her, I always seem to eat the first 2-4 in a row.
---
You know what's efficient? Putting the time in to be a better player. Putting the time in to learn skips so you save 20s not pulling a certain pack every run, but then doing that 5+ times. Then not having any downtime associated with those packs.
---
You know what's efficient? Not being a shit player who wants (for some reason) to unironically take 2 hours to run half of a full BRD clear every single day. Do you mark things for sheep too in end game dungeons?
---
Man, what a troll :o
---
Glad someone ended up helping you out.
---
That is a kick or black list from me. Fuck anyone who takes healer gear as a mage

We do have a strong contingent from Central Europe as well, and I myself am US based.

I'm a douchebag for telling the truth? Wild
---
for a Rogue around 30-35 with two Cruel Barbs
---
if an Electrocutioner Leg drops, would you equip it in MH or OH?
---
ik its kinda meaningless question because the choice in this situation prolly has low impact but I wonder how such things should be valued
---
First try on the first try.
---
I have only crying
---
Oh yeah, I was drunk when I wrote it lol.
---
100% this doesn't work as described. 6 or 7 fireballs just took all the threat from both of us.
---
Just check the video. In comments people are complaining that rogue sometimes gets hammered beyond repair. So 3man is the safe way.
---
Literally know how you feel. Hunter takes dal rend and thinks it's BiS. Just cause wowhead says so doesn't make it true fellow nerds.
---
So the bar shows when the time between 2 auto attacks?
---
Then I have to use my ability in the middle of the bars?
---
From looking at the map I assume you're at Astranaar, wouldn't the FP at the northern end of Stonetalon shorten the ride? Not sure just guessing.

Why is hyperbole so popular? It doesn’t help anyone and hurts any positive view that a person has about something.
---
Listen to this guy, tank dungeons for anyone and everyone and you can literally hand pick what you want.  Orbs, scourgestones, boe greens, non-MS weapons.  You just pick anything, people will say okay.
---
Comment on a German server this weekend: Stranglethorn is so fucking overrun, you can't finish even one fucking quest.
---
Blizzard doesn’t do anything about ninja looting. It’s a feature of the game.
---
I love that you guys all reveal yourselves.
---
Is this why small flame sacs sell so high? I didn't really think those potions were all that good and it must be people who really like dragon breath chili.
---
Great feedback! I've tried watching a couple of vidoes of tanks at all levels (not so many low-level ones available since Skarm didn't follow up his RFC video like I'd hoped), and I have also noticed that new tanks tend to abuse taunt and forget the shouts. However, I have a few questions as follow-ups on your points:
---
1. From what I've gathered, shield block + revenge seems to outperform sunder armor when it comes to threat generation, though the armor decrease of sunder armor is sure to make the fights a bit faster/smoother so I'm trying to mix the two. 
---
2. Depending on how careful I have to be with the pull I will when possible charge in battle stance (don't even have berserker yet tho) then switch to def for extra threat before doing demo/battle shout. I've read on several occasions that thunder clap is pretty much garbage so I rarely use it (slower hits = less rage as well) unless someone pulls a patrol or something. Battle shout seems to be pretty good if there are many melees around to gain more aggro (or if everyone is close enough to get buffed either way), and demo shout as the go-to area threat generation unless I need to use challenging shout (just got it so I haven't played around with it much).
---
3. Learning about which mobs do what is one of those experience things. I tend to focus down casters first which is probably a good rule of thumb, but I'm sure there are exceptions in some dungeons.
---
You could play the blamegame with both roles.
---
Well, you can't tank if you're dead either, nor heal.
---

---

---
It varies vastly from server to server. On Silvermoon EU it's not an uncommon sight.
---
Crimson Felt Hat is such a saucy look. Unironically one of the most dapper accoutrements in the game.
---
I like your style.
---
Good luck! It’s worth the time invested. It’s one of the best looking mounts in the game in my opinion.
---
"classic wowhead engineering guide"
---
thanks, wowhead wasnt working the moment i tried to examine it
---
okay, so this simplifies my question
---
is it better than Cruel Barb (its has lower dmg)
---
Also wenn man nicht weggefetzt wird wieso kann man sonst keine Quest abgeben?
---
Be a man and brag openly, this is some pathetic shit.
---
20 more runs today.  12 were Grizzle.  0 orcs, 1 ogre.
---
While I was waiting for the lockout to wear off on my runs a priest guildmate had one drop in their group.  Feels bad.
---
How is it any different on the other healers? Serious question
---
They use the same gear anyways!
---
If you had an older version, it may have disabled logging of gray items. In next version I'll allowing selecting what to log, but in the mean time you can edit the WTF\Account\ACCOUNT\SavedVariables\FarmLog.lua look for "itemQuality" and make sure all items under it are "true". 
---
Should look like this -
---
&gt;["itemQuality"] = {
---
&gt;		true, -- [1]
---
&gt;		true, -- [2]
---
&gt;		true, -- [3]
---
&gt;		true, -- [4]
---
&gt;		true, -- [5]
---
&gt;		true, -- [6]
---
&gt;	},
---
It is not common, the rogue is an ass and should be kicked and/or blacklisted.
---
As a healer, I have spent all my solo farming ability to be dedicated at my job. I sacrificed my solo ability for the group I work with and if the rogue decides he is playing a solo game then he can play it in its entirety. Hope his bandage game is on point.
---
The whole party worked to get to the chest. It is not his and "time spent levelling the skill" is irrelevant in the context of a party because he would need it in solo play too. It is his party skill as he otherwise only brings damage (and nowadays not even CC).
---
No. The people with addons can use gui to see ur listings, but people without it will see ur messages if u LFM, and if u LFG it will scan the chat and parse any open groups for u to click on.
---
Great tool.
---
guide doesn't list useless for things from engineering? i must be looking at the wrong one. can u link me?
---
I know for mages clearcasting makes a sound when it procs
---
Are you 60 already? Oh god that’s going to be me isn’t it? 60 and still farming BRD.
---
How do you do that?   They're not the king, so they cant get to the chest.
---
That's because everyone greeds it. U get called out for needing on a green btw.
---
/r/beetlejuicing ?
---
No. You buy every poison mat at vendors
---
but its how the game works.  doesnt matter where it ranks on youre needs list.  upgrade is an upgrade.  this is why people with your opinion shouldnt pug
---
Bonebiter is better than WW axe and ravaged is awesome for AE pulls
---
Masterloot -&gt; send to partymember is one possibility I guess.
---
Dude, he took a healer ring because it was blue without asking
---
Dick move
---
Because its strange. Why do I fight with a wooden stick against gnolls when they are laserbeaming shooting spaceships flying around. At least gimme a lasersword instead if you try to do scifi stuff
---
Well in the first few weeks of WoW, the cities were more or less dead, since the vast majority of players were out leveling. Don't think it was much of a layering problem as much as just people simply not being there, and those that were not bothering. 
---
Unless you've got a defending raid, defending against an enemy raid is tantamount to suicide.
---
You're a dweeb.
---
Go for either DKP or EPGP loot distribution. NEVER EVER GO FOR A LOOTCOUNCIL IN A 40 MAN RAID GUILD! Those lootcouncils are very likely to be corrupt as hell. The more people there are, the less likely they are to work properly.
---
Healing is like half threat per pt healed.  Overhealing does nothing.
---
&gt;But they don't want to, so they can recreate a feeling that is close to vanilla.
---
Nope. Its just a way to suck people in if people stop their subscriptions. Just look at DM. 
---
Atm, people easily clear content. The "feeling" is long gone.
---
Hey im on Bloodfang EU too! I too have gotten a reputation. Someone /w me to join Molten Core even though i was heavily undergeared and not even attuned. They didn't have a single druid. I managed to sneak attune and join the raid.
---
My only job was buffs and decurse, they didn't care if i did any damage or healing otherwise. I felt like i became a mascot. Was told by one of the raid leaders that the people in their guild absolutely loved me (about half of the raid was from the same guild).
---
Ah yes, someone playing a spec they like which is not necessarily as good as others, must be an ‘edgelord vampire’.
---
It doesn't matter because shit can and does happen, regardless of how simple a task is or how good of a player you are. I simply don't believe thay anyone is capable of never making the occasional dumbass fumble.
---
By not clearing out certain packs of mobs you are leaving an increased risk of shit happening. Sometimes it's worth the risk, sometimes it is really not, especially in pugs.
---
Not my work! Just wanted to share it here
---
These usually pop up after you buy gold or other services. Whoever the OP is basically outted themselves as a gold buyer lol
---
Mages have to do a quest to get better water. Buff classes have to buy reagents to buff the raid. Druids have to buy acorns rez people. Hunters have to buy food to keep their pet happy, and buy arrows to do higher dps. Warlocks have to farm shards to summon and pass out stones.
---
Every class has to do something that doesn't help them individually to buff the group. Part of being a rogue is opening stuff for the group, so I really disagree with you. If you don't want to do your class quests to have higher support for a group then the group has no reason to invite you over other dps.
---
Get 60.
---
Like.. Don't take this the wrong way, but you're the worst man. 
---
And this is coming from a fellow holy priest.
---
Shouldn’t have to farm ravager too hard, it drops rather often.  I wouldn’t put too much stock in it, as it is basically a fun weapon after you outgrow it.
---
If you’re running around with the ww axe you’re either 2h fury or arms, in which case the only upgrade for you is bone biter.
---
If you really need a 1h because you tank lots, go for it, but if you don’t tank much, don’t bother, because every dungeon 40+ has decent 1h weapons in them.
---
AFAIK you might have to write up or copy in a WA command for it then. You might perhaps find one googling about, I haven't bothered setting up WA yet even though I probably should. Bonkers good addon based on videos I've seen and the amount of praise I see on here.
---
Been playing there for a month now. Luv it cant complain
---
As a mage that's been doing lashes a lot, I can say that they aren't that great. The herbing is solid as you'll get about 1-1.5 stacks of dreamfoil and groms per hour along with a mix of other stuff, somebody which is trash and some is useful. The raw gold isnt great but will net about 16g per hour. I've had a lot of greens drop as well, as well as a few backpacks
---
As a lock though, I'm pretty sure you can solo all of East and make an absolute killing. Check for some YouTube videos. People are still figuring it out. Pretty sure imp lady is only boss that hasn't been figured out
---
If you are good geared and have a healer-friend, just reserve all orbs in Strat-Live and share them with him.
---
A pug warlock and a pug spriest will both take gear which will never help you in future anyway, because it's a pug
---
Well, ganking in general is frowned upon, even more so if they're fishing. But the word gank means something different now than it did back in vanilla. Now it seems to mean any pvp kill, while back then it was any pvp kill where you were at a massive advantage, as in much higher level or much bigger group.
---
Totem timers classic is okay. A very similar one I use now is Samis (?) totemtimers
---
Whaat a guildie on the subreddit
---
S/o to our guild hehe
---
Oh wow ofcourse!
---
I didn't even think about that.. but doesn't he have to be near the masterlooter to be able to get it?
---
English is my 1st language and I fucken suck at it
---
Definitely not the same everywhere, varies wildly from language to language.
---
Why are you here then?
---
DAT ASS!!!!
---
Hell, me and the boys just killed Ragnaros tonight for a guild first tonight, got to IF and it was full of people and that was maybe 1130/12 est?
---
They conjure their own crayons to eat
---
Druids really don't need a lot of gear when leveling. It's about the same as hunters, really. As long as your kill speed is high enough that you can kill 2-3 mobs before needing to heal, you can pretty much grind indefinitely.
---
Dungeons are a full little diversion, though. Unless your goal is to power to 60 as fast as possible, I'd recommend doing every dungeon once, purely for the quests.
---
t. retail player
---
it's 15 gold on our server =)
---
I figure you should go quick on OH because you will miss most of them and it will increase your hit frequency on OH. Plus poisons application frequency.
---
I remember in TBC oh gave a chance to get energy back depending on spec so was good for that too.
---
To the point where lower geared players ask if they can need on the green, I know. And then the same people that call it out  /need on Edgemasters when there are two warriors in group who really need it.
---
It's peak hypocrisy and there is very little you can do to change my mind.
---
Flashback to AdiButtonsAura, the best addon in the game
---
GET DOWN MR PRESIDENT!
---
Pretty early. As long as you can sneak in you just have to line his casts and he's not too bad. Have a health pot available for the first couple of tries when you're getting used to the timing.

No, they exist to cut down on developer time.

There's no reason to not eat in dungeons ~~if we have a mage~~

After you defeated the king only a few mobs will be aggresive and you can invis pot those. It seems really buggy.

Nicely done.

I don't think that I am hitting that 5/hour cap. My runs are about 10-12minutes with it taking 2 minutes for lead to pass to alt, and whenever i walk back to mara, i've not gotten locked. I'll try retiming my runs, ty!
---
Spell Cleave not strong enough!!!
---
Honestly, I thought it would die, never been so happy to be wrong.
---
Same here, I cant abandon my dear piggy Fientje that I tamed at level 10. I cant and wond trade all the good memories for some high dps orange cat!
---
Every person in this game should play a tank and a healer before they play a DPS.
---
What an ideal world that would be.
---
brb migrating :p
---
Eu/Na?
---
The real question is: which addon monitors the resource use of your addons? Some are real performance hogs, others straight up memory leak
---
at 0 skill its 35% penalty, at 5 its 15% at 8 its 7% and at 12 is 5% (capped) 
---
the key is that if you are going with edgemaster, that means you are replacing devil, and flameguard is a better upgrade with cloud as your pants.
---
and this gap goes farther and farther as you get more gear in later tiers.
---
If your group is killing things too fast for your dots to run through, you're probably better off not using them on trash and just spam shadow bolt. DPS are stuck in this mentality that they ABSOLUTELY NEED to use their optimized DPS rotation on every single pull, which they do not. If you are wasting mana because your dots are not running through, you should not use them period, they are a waste of your mana, therefore of your HP, and therefore of healer mana.
---
Every mob should be aggressive to anyone that isn't the king.   If you are the king, then you can still be killed by the plants and bugs.
---
ye its garbage for them. They have DM trinket + 2% crit.
---
I play on silent a lot :(

The only thing we now for sure as far as timelines go is that P2 will be released before the end of the year, so Nov/Dec at some point. Anything else you hear about other release times is speculation and bullshit.
---
In my experience the "worst" about apologizing for their "poor" english are english-fluent Brazilians.
---
Like shit, native speakers are lazy relax.
---
It depends on your class. For something like Paladin, you want to time your seals/judgments between auto attack hits. This way you can judge (which drops your seal) and then re-seal (which has an effect when your auto attack hits) before the next attack lands. 
---
With other classes, you might time autos and abilities to hit close together, for bigger chunks.
---
I have played near 8 hours a day since released on average and workout 9 times a week, work 25, maintain relationship with SO and social events. However the latter definitely took a hit for a few weeks. All about prioritising. I appreciate it is to much time to spend in front of a screen though but at the same time, classic has given me a feeling I haven't had since being a kid so I'm going to cherish it.
---
You put it back on passive and it will run back to its original position if it was on stay before
---
What kind of stupid question is this?
---
Maybe they aren't trying to min-max..
---
I like the large hitbox, tauren stomp, and yeah the extra 5% health - but I realize that orc/troll might be better.

If you ever join a very top raiding guild they will disenchant gear you need before giving it to you as a trial member for like an entire month.

---
For grouping it doesn't matter, for gearing only slightly. Supply of items goes down, but so does demand - so you might have to wait for some gear a little bit longer, but pay the same regardless
---
Yeah, I was not referring to the player but to the spec itself. Look from design perspective at it - it's shadowy, dark and drains life with everything it does, unable to use holy spells etc.
---
Rocket helm  and everlook tp are probs the most important goblin bop items. Gnomish has more bop items. That’s why min max go gnomish then drop it and go goblin
---
It's a bear, but it's dire.
---
No, it results from people not being able to do so. LBRS, 4 people skip all the trash you can skip to save ourselves a lot of time, one person can't follow others steps (even while having 4 people literally leading and showing the way how to do it), idk, maybe he has follow set up or autowalking, maybe he eats with one hand and walks with other. He aggroes 2 packs and instead of dying he runs away to group wiping them. Thats usually the case from my experience. It's not skipping mobs, it's not caring enough to play well. This person also proceeds to leave the party afterwards so there is that. Unpleasant but happened 3 times already. Oh, there is also some hunter pet pulls after you tell them to dismiss pet like 10 fucking times or UBRS arena jumps / veteran knockback after aggroing pack due to not being aware of your surroundings. After explaining that it can happen and telling how it can be avoided or doing /rw MOVE, DON'T DRINK HERE, PATROL INCOMING, DON'T JUMP TO THE ARENA, STAY WITH YOUR BACK CLOSE TO WALL WITH VETERANS AROUND. People don't care, they don't play well and are not taking responsibility after commiting mistakes. It's not "sorry, my bad", "I fucked this one up", "Fuck I shouldn't stand there, sorry guys". It's always "wHy yOu nO cLeAr aLl tRaSh?", "oMg wHy rUsH gUyS?", "wE bEtTeR cLeAr", "wE sHoUlD cLeAr". I started having already two more packs being killed (three dragons upstairs and one pack of orcs near Jed) after people aggroed these and wiped raid over and over again. People want to enjoy dungeon run, people also want to kill bosses, clear it, not kill every fucking elite in the raid instance. It's not the same. You don't have to kill everything, every elite pack kill takes time. You have to be good or at least listen to more experienced players when they try to lead you through. I am not asking you to top dps, be geared up or use consumables to clear faster. I am not pushing you through your limits. I just want you to try and play good, not even your best. Just good enough so you can be an asset instead of hindrance. I mean, I am not private server veteran, I just hit 60 first time as you do, all I do is put effort to what I am doing, really. Please try doing the same or don't join group content as nobody really want to drag dead weight which is complaining and making dungeon run harder than it should be.
---
I didn't say it couldn't work.  That makes your comment just as useless as mine.  Downvote yourself for being stupid.
---
Yeah thats what i mean with it is behaving buggy. Only the guards, plants and a few reaver are staying aggressive to non kings. Thats why it feels like such an exploit, because on top of that everyone can loot the items in the chest.
---
Because they are great.. WL Main here :P
---
Also in chat, just before:
---
"MMGGGrRRrrrRRRBLBBLLUAAaRGHHH!!!!" (times 8 or so)
---
Not entirely true. If explicit rules are agreed to before the run starts, and then the leader changes shit up part-way through, Blizzard can and will take action. 
---
Ex. You ask "is anything reserved" before starting, leader says "no", then after the last boss dies, changes to master looter and takes item x because it's all he really wanted out of the dungeon. That's reportable.
---
But in this case, blizzard isn't doing anything. Loot was set to FFA, no rule about boes was discussed. OP fucked up, live with it.
---
Actually, the blue light causes your brain to produce less melatonin. Because of this you get less sleepy and play for longer than you should.
---
Orc lock here. Can confirm lock is awesome haha.
---
same here, 30-40 was pain for me, making gold, levling, upgrading skill in all proffesions. 40-50 was much faster with my Ram mount. I am now lvl 52 and slowly making progress in reputations, especially to darnassus for epic kitty. I run only one dungeon, Deadmines, since than only quests and grind.
---
Ohh, yah, that's fucked up.  I didn't know that.  I saw someone advertise selling shit from the chest before, but I didn't understand how it's possible.
---
&gt; Back when Blizzard was created any muppet could get into game development. Today? Not so much.
---
Maybe for AAA titles but this is kind of a golden age for independent games. Some days it feels like everybody and their mother are posting their pet-projects to r/gaming
---
On Alliance, Slam 2H is definitely better early on until you can gear out for DW. However, Slam resets your swing timer at the end of the cast, delaying your rage generation from auto attacks. Spamming hamstring, while the ability itself is lower damage for similar rage, trawling for Windfury procs while maintain AA rage generation parses a bit higher I believe.
---
Also, I didn't down vote you, I hate it when people down vote just if the disagree rather than discussing.
---
Happened to me as well, I didn't know how good or rare Hand of Justice is back then. Nobody rolled, I rolled very low, like 3 maybe and I got it. It took me like 5 runs to get this trinket, felt good.
---
Actually, most of the people I meet at that hour are shift workers.
---
To be fair, a lot of time people spent in retail was in instances such as LFG, LFR, Mythic dungeons, and old world content. You never really saw them out in the open world or idle in cities. In Classic, however, the only thing *to do* at max level is to AFK in one of the few cities for half an hour until you can join a dungeon group.
---
I think that YOU are an agent of the burning blade, trying to get revenge from Thazz'ril because you loved his pickaxe but someone bring it back to him.
---
so what did you do? im getting the same bug
---
And you make so much gold with it too. You can sell every ring and staff for at least 100g on my realm.
---
Yeah exactly. I saw it in the AH for 150 yesterday though... might be worth selling it now.
---
I wouldn't tank a fisherman.  
---
Unless I too am a fisherman at that point in time and he's going for a rare school of fish..
---
You also can get melee'd by her.
---
Thank you! Will do if I can't make it work today. On my way to work rn.
---
Pass on the help when you find someone else stuck in a similar situation.
---
As a herb lock I prefer Mara. Basically zero chance of me dying where in dme if I mess up I’m dead. I’ve found the gph to be very similar but in Mara I advertise ring runs which dramatically improves the gph.
---
Sorry dude but you set the loot rules in game. Granted his is a little shit for just taking them and running but Blizz will tell you your out of luck. Alas you can just ignore them and avoid them at all costs. If your guildies wanna listen to block them that is up to them.
---
Really just ignore them and go on with your game. Karma comes to bite those in the ass later for shit the pull. Im sure if they act like that with a world BOE drop, shit is gonna happen in a pug raid that they are gonna be at the center for attention for. And not the good kind.
---
The wipes are still an investment, as now up to 4 additional players know that skip and overall it will save more time than the single wipe costs. Unless it is a stupid skip of course, but I can't think of many.
---
What you are probably seeing is an influx of new tanks because players got fed up with waiting for hours to get into a dungeon. They are still testing the skips, give them time.
---
Most of the time I'm tanking myself, so from my experience most wipes are the result of patrolling mobs (most commonly fear Gargoyles) or miscommunication like starting to AoE at the wrong time.
---
its not so bad if it's dungeon that you like but when you have run full BRD 3-4 times to get all the loot and quests you want done in that place it can go die in a fire somewhere. scholo on the other hand i will run until it locks me out, you want to whisper me to tank anything? make it scholo and i will bite you hand off
---
"So you are coming to steal from these dwarves again ... 28th time today ... don't you have anything else to do with your life?"
---
I don't know, I think that was a "pushed" agenda more so then a real thing people actually thought was going to happen.
---
A lot of people wanted classic wow to fail, for whatever reason.
---
What class? What professions?
---
It's definitely not the same experience. But since I'm not dropping money to grind in EQ again, it's my museum piece.
---
i normally just say no thanks, never had anyone get bitchy about it and if they ever did they would just get added to ignore to avoid having to deal with a bitch in the future
---
My worst one was when doing Arena/Anger/Golem runs as Warrior and some Hunter rolled need on HoJ when it finally dropped after 40+ runs. Luckily I won the roll, but what Really irked me is this bozo claimed HoJ was BIS for Hunter and after a while of telling him he's dead wrong he finally fezzed up to needing it simply because it was better than his current trinkets (carrot + argent Dawn badge).
---
Like, fuck you, dude. Hinterlands + Blackhand trinkets are both guaranteed from quests and way better for you, but you still need on HoJ?
---
Struggeling with enjoying my paladin (36) and druid (30).  
---
Not fond of alliance priests or warlocks, but I am alliance at heart.  
---
How is their solo farming? And are they able to contribue in PvP without BiS?  
---
Would one even have a chance to be invited to normal groups?  
---
Is spell cleave still a thing?
---
Should I migrate, or should i delete everything and reroll horde?
---
What is currently in demand on the horde side?
---
Currently resides on *Zandalar Tribe RP-PVP (EU)*, great server. Lot's of interesting characters. But how is the balance? Hate to be on a pvp server with too much inbalance.
---
Short, I don't mind healing. I don't mind dpsing. Kind of don't enjoy pets too much, but seems like Warlock pet's are a bit more manageable with macros, and alter sacrifice/mana battery/DS.   
---
I raided as a rogue in Vanilla through WotLK, and a healer until Legion, but always envied other classes that could more easily group up or solo stuff.
---
Here's the charm of vanilla, do whatever the fuck you want. It's a choice not many games offer you still. If you want to gank people, go for it. Hoad gold? go for it. Become and altoholic? there's a ton of new classes for you to try out.
---
That's pretty much that, do what you want. If you're main oriented i'd say hoarding gold is probably the most useful thing for you to do.
---
I've just released an update that fixes this (v1.7.3)
---
There were treasures locked behind parkour in WoD. Flying killed it but it was fun while it lasted.
---
Join Faerlina. People hate on it but its the most active and at any given time theres people doing dungeons and raids. At peak hours you might have an hour queue at most but its not too bad.
---
By the time I get my hunter to 60, they'll of course have this fixed, lol.
---
It's very useful for kiting as it allows you to pop back into melee range at the precise time an auto hit will go off. It's also useful to know when the next swing is going off so you don't 'waste'  the auto hit 0.1 sec before it goes off by using casting abilities, or in the case of druid and hunter where abilities such as Maul and Raptor Strike are bound to attack speed and will only go off on the next auto hit.
---
It's not necessary to have it but it feels nice to know and have the information available.
---
What gear upgrades should I prioritize as a level 31 rogue or is that something I even need to worry about?
---
Damn this is cute, i want a cat again &lt;3
---
Classic+ wil never happen
---
Yes but you don’t need to be BiS to clear the current content, and getting a second or third biS is largely good enough because min maxing is not mandatory in classic (at least at this point).
---
I understand that people want to min max, but sometimes people don’t even think about why it’s the best and what are the alternatives.
---
No, look at the i in the name blizzard.
---
I like being competitive in the game so both options are pretty much unenjoyable. For me at least.
---
I did it once and it dropped ama
---
Got Guldanshower locked down on my server
---
For OP, [more info on normalization](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Normalization).
---
It seems to be balanced overall, but it's says that for characters over level 40 the total amount is pretty even, but as active players alliance have 2000 active player while horde only have 500 active players. How does it affect?
---
because he IS a spoiled brat.
---
I think I snapshot Ted this on the 4th of November or something, iirc it didn’t launch until the 26th.
---
Hamstring kiting doesn't really work in classic with melee leeway. At least its not worth it from what I've tried.
---
its cause the worg from LBRS has the highest rank of howl for raiding. I got it then went to feralas and tamed one of those wolves for my raid buff pet. Im the hunter class lead for &lt;Vanguard&gt; on Pagle and even I tell my hunters raid with what you want. Our pets do not live very long on some bosses so if you want the extra DPS bring a cat, want to try and help your melee group bring a wolf. Want to be that one ass hole for the nigh and bring a tallstrider (I did for the giggles and Cocobo is now the guild Meme) then go for it. Its your pet, you have to keep it alive, you have to keep it happy do with it as you please.
---
Really get what you want. If your looking to solo one of my guildmates find that the owls from winterspring have the highest rank of screech and they hold AOE like champs. 
---
I myself have a Tallstrider (was first pet), the feralas wolf, and the rare blue frostsaber from winterspring.
---
You could also argue most whipes happen because lots of people have terrible positional awareness
---
Interesting! Can you post where you read that?
---
Profession vs. class ability.
---
I know for Priests, Hydra is constantly releasing lists of gear he sees as pre raid bis and post raid bis for both PvE and PvP on his website - deathblind.com
---
As each phase releases I'm sure he will be updating these as he goes. He even has videos explaining his reasons on each piece etc. Worth checking out for any Priests out there!
---
What they mean depends on your group makeup.  Raids will usually have those marks set in meaning so the raid leader doesn’t have to explain every single time, but in groups it just depends on what you have.
---
If you usually use moon to sheep and you have no mage, then clearly it doesn’t mean sheep for that group.
---
"honest mistake"
---
I would be furious, sucks man
---
There is yes, it's everything for rogues except gouge, kick and eviscerate if memory serves.
---
Is that elvui? What resolution are you playing on?

That's the risk you take when joining a guild pug, or pugs in general for that matter. But good to know, thanks.

---
Its not a big deal. I rerolled on there because its the most active no complaints so far.
---
I think all stat weight / HEP comparisons I have seen are for level 60, or few levels short. Even then, they are not absolute and vary depending on your overall gear level, the content/encounter, fight length and other factors.
---
When leveling up Int is your go-to stat most of the time, as your Mana pool will dictate how many spells you can cast - 22 bonus healing will be a marginal ben fit at best. Once you get your hands on more pieces and can start stacking +heal downranking becomes more relevant, but 22 +healing alone won't make your life much better. You will want to start stacking mp5 as well when you can, since spirit is pretty useless on most fights for shamans.
---
Look up Egregious's resto shaman guide and pre-raid BiS lists for an idea of these things - but keep in mind any HEP numbers are subject to constant change, and more guidelines than absolute truths.
---
It's within a window. So the super tryhard guilds who assign people to watch for spawns in shifts and maintain warlock summoning alts and have members available to log on at any time will have a shot at it.
---
Seal of Command works on PPM (procs per minute).
---
On average, you get the same number of procs per minute regardless of weapon speed.   
---
But slower weapons have higher damage range, which leads to more damage per proc.  
---
Also, Seal of Command shouldn't be normalized yet (don't think that happens 'till TBC), so the slower your weapon speed, the higher the damage bonus from attack power.
---
SoC heavily favors slow weapons. Arcanite Reaper is awesome with it.
---
The healers I have that tend to complain the loudest are the ones during quick runs when no one died but the healer kept going oom towards the end of the pulls.. as a tank I know the wiggle room I have, he doesn't need to end pulls with mana and if he does he should top me up with a big heal so we can get working on next group as he is drinking..
---
Wonder why normal when pvp is more populated
---
I wouldn't say thats normal
---
I rather not have to drink after every pull
---
Wow. Is this against TOS? If not...
---
There is in game voice?
---
my interface addon "pitbull" (or was it bartender?) added the timer by itselfe to my portray
---

---
Rule 3 of this subreddit.
---
Yeah but it's not like everyone knows what every class's BiS items are, I certainly have no clue what mine are nevermind anyone else's.
---
Flight paths are 100% horde favored compared to alliance
---
I dinged 40 with ~140 gold. No crazy secret leveling methods or any rare/epic drops. Just skinned every mob and didn't waste money on lowbie gear. I did a level of purely just grinding in Shimmering Flats though. Only learned the purely necessary skills from 30-40, though. So that ate up another ~40g after I bought my mount.
---
Whoah you're really lucky that feign at 8 minutes worked, nice kill though! How many attempts?
---
Me too man. If anything, my apm and reactions have gone down since vanilla, so it can't be a matter of skill. Besides, most people were already spamming that frostbolt/shadowbolt/eviscerate/whatever as fast as they could back in late 2006, so I don't know how much more "skillful" you can get. 
---
Then again, I do not have a mechanical keyboard, a 144hz monitor, or Gunnar optics glasses, so maybe that's holding my middle aged ass back. :)
---
I was under the impression that poison procs were normalized (internal CD?) and so weapon speed became irrelevant for applying them.
---
I'm sorry that you had a bad player on a shadow priest, but that doesn't make shadow bad. Like I said, i'm logging top DPS on multiple fights and putting out 400+ DPS.
---
Should a rogue with the BIS Sword Brut Blade be allowed to roll on the BIS MC daggers when he is sword spec?
---
That means your group could be pushing harder. If you're constantly at max resources and group at full health then there's a few mobs missing in that pull. Tell the tank to do more calculated risks. If there's not enough mobs to go around then you're doing the dungeon optimally, which is the dream.
---
If it's "too" smooth, it can get kind of boring. You end up feeling like you're mainly an insurance in case something goes wrong.
---
Nothing wrong with telling the tank you've got plenty of mana - so they can pull faster if they want.
---
I want Blizz to take classic up to TBC so I can make belf paladin and tank with it.
---
maybe they need a pve server people can transfer to because of overpopulation :P
---
Beat me to it &gt;.&gt;
---
I don't see a problem with that
---
Not everyone or everything can be top
---
A little unclear which class you’re  asking about solo farming(paladin/druid/warlock/priest?). I’m assuming you’re asking about warlock. Warlocks are one of the stronger solo farm classes, having many options for farming instances(mara and dm) as well as farming open world well. Warlock pvp is quite strong and should be one of less gear dependent classes. 
---
Spell cleave is mainly a leveling thing and warlocks do have a role to play in groups. Typically the only classes in hardcore aoe groups are mage, priest, druid/war/pally and warlock. Mages are typically preferred over warlocks in these cases as they have more utility but you have similar damage output and eye of kilrog pulls are relevant for the harder core groups. 
---
I don’t know much about the specific server but I’d assume there’s an ample number of everything but tanks so it’s okay to pick whatever you prefer playing.
---
I’m a priest main and most of what I said is similar to warlock as they can farm similarly well and have roles in spellcleave
---
You only have one dot, and it is the best dot in the game. So usually you can afford the one debuff slot. I am allowed to use sw:p in my guild. Mana pots and runes are whatever. Spriest is fun and that's what matters.
---
I gank horde at pools my girlfriend wants. Especially wreckage. She's my healer so anything to keep her happy lol.
---
It may just be the 1.12 version actually dropped less.  
---
That being said they have changed stuff like the buffs stacking - which wasnt changed untill TBC.  
---
Granted that is very understandable.  
---
But it makes me wonder in regards to the nerf to Demo Shout Threat.  I keep hearing that was a change and not a fix. 
---
Same goes for mob-tagging/ghosting in the open world.  That was in vanilla and should be in the modern version too, imo. 
---
I may be reading into it too much, little tin foil hat type of thing.  Just something a friend and i discussed afew days ago.
---
What server?  In NA even the biggest servers only have a queue at primetime and its barely a queue...
---
r/whoosh
---
*laughs in druid*
---
Oh wait
---
Pretty sure you could get away with drinking once, topping them up then moving on. You're not gonna melt your refilled mana bar topping up party members that have mostly regened while you drink.
---
I think he’s aware
---
thank you :D
---
But dwarves are icky 🤢
---
It actually doesn’t matter for any class.
---
If you are on a pvp server or plan to pvp at all, your basically best off leveling gnomish engineering with mining and creating all the trinkets you want, then switching to goblin for sapper charges.
---
haha someone in my guild asked "can we play that for heigen?" after we were done
---
Just outed yourself as gullible.
---
:D
---
Oh that is at least a slight relief
---
As much as I want Classic+, it would be so much easier for Blizz to release TBC servers than to actually develop new content. They already know people like TBC and Wrath. May as well just get TBC working with the new client and they basically get to print money.
---
The only way I see Classic+ is if Classic actually outpaces Retail in the coming months.
---
Easy i go to OG and see more people in retail then in highest pop. pve realm in germany.
---
Just tested it yesterday.
---
We don't have to be delucional and say things like its dead or treat it like it would be still as full as launch day.
---
Pugs? It's kinda scummy, but a lot of them go by a "you need what you need" thing. MS &gt; OS typically, and for a sword rogue, daggers are OS.
---
For a guild? Absolutely not. Dedicate a few dagger rogues and let them roll on them.
---
What a cute walking dead!
---
Feral Druid
---
I got jumped by a 60 Rouge the other day and he killed me. Didn't find him when I ressed so my retribution was to kill all the lvl \~30s, I could find in Arathi Higlands .
---
come in at the right time for me, had just hit 56 so meant i could just go in and do it, doesn't feel rushed at all, if anything it feels like they felt the initial plan was too slow with the majority of people being 50+ and only really those that joined late or play for 3-4 hours a week being behind that. i wish they had put the key ring in with Dire Maul as my bags are rapidly filling up with keys for things i am currently doing

Well all people that say its dead are just dumb BUT at least for my server the player count since launch dropped significatly i would guess at least 30% also layers are gone and OG is getting less and less populated. Keep in mind this is the biggest pve german server so don't wanna imagine how emty low or medium servers must feel.
---
Lvl 44, have very little time to fully sitting down with it, but I do really like to just casually quest around
---
All my server has is some guy who tells in lfg about our daily posture check
---
Why do you think raids with warlocks want a shadow priest?
---
The guy you are replying to specified being specced into shadow weaving in his post
---
Yea every time a group skips a pack by a hair and in my head i'm just "Do you really want to do that ? Someones gonna walt into it! I Hope its not me!" and then someone actually accidently pulls the pack and gets screamed on and insulted.
---
Really? I dont think the one accidently pulling is the idiot, if you havent learned by now that this will happen 3 out of 5 times. Do that stuff with your guild but you can not depend on randoms (or me) in a situation like that.
---
Yes it should be easy, but its clearly not sometimes.
---
Other things are buggy/glitchy skips that half the group and especially new players dont know how to do, usually they just leave the group because they are scared to pull, fall or fuck up in another way and that sucks.
---
Just pull the mobs controlled and everything will be fine.
---
But then there is probably someone in the group with the "Gogogo!" attitude and the tank gets the insults and screaming, i guess everyone just deflects this behavour as good as they can.
---
I feel like i must tell you, I love you.  I don't know why, but I had to.
---
Multishot is evil. Even if the hunter feigns death before the mobs arrive in the ranged camp and promptly maul the healer, he already messed up the positioning of the mobs towards the tank, and awakened every sheep in sight.
---
lol most realms are not busy as fuck. At least half of the realms are going to be dead af not even a year from now.
---
You use sinister strike. It counts as MH attack and can proc poison
---
don't think anyone with a brain said it would be dead. a lot of people, myself included, said there would be a drop off in numbers, and there has been this is evident by the fact they were able to remove layering completely on some servers and the higher populated ones are running 1-2 extra layers.
---
This is also why it looks just as packed as when you started, as server populations stabilised and the ones that thought they did but didn't have left it has meant that less layers are needed so you still seem to have the same amount of people on the layer with you, in some cases more as they layer is spread out over the whole continent.
---
Imagine having so few arguments that you resort to such responses everywhere people don't blindly agree with your baseless claims. I would say grow up kid, but I don't really feel like stooping to down to your level.
---
Absolutely, I had all of them and it was fun to switch between all the weapons.
---
all your abilities work off the MH, with a 5% miss rate. your autoattacks are both hands with a 24% miss rate.
---
Yes. If someone dies, the healer gets the blame, if everyone lives, the tank and DPS played correctly. So yes, in a good group, it's hard for a healer to shine. In a bad group, well, it's hard for a healer to please everyone. That's why I rolled a mage this time around. The mage is 55 now, and I'm currently leveling a priest alt as well, because I miss healing.
---
my man, exactly the same course of actions, but I still get killed most of the times :/
---
For it to be a dick move, he would need intent of shitting on someone for the purpose of being a dick. If it’s a minor upgrade for him, and BiS for someone else and he needs without first asking, then that’s just a noob being a noob .. big difference if you ask me
---
His structure isn't perfect
---
It's definitely readable and absolutely fine, but it's not perfect. He uses commas far too liberally in addition to using commas before 'and' when it's connecting two dependent clauses
---
Depends on which phase we are talking about. In the current phase there isn't a lot of raid loot for druid tanks for example and your post-raid BiS still includes more dungeon items than the other way around. This will massively change with the release of AQ40 (not going to happen anytime soon).
---
And in the end the lack of BiS gear in raids mostly tells you it is not a fully supported spec.
---
I had something very similar happen to me. So I’ve been leveling my enchanting skill so I’ve been making a lot of lesser wands and bracer enchants and I’d give them away for free in elwynn. So recently I was looking for a portal from Stormwind to Darnassus and I put an ad out on the trade channel and someone got a message to me that they’d do it for free. And when I asked why they said it was because I’d given them a wand when they first started playing and it made leveling in the starter area a lot easier. I also had a couple of people send me some green/blue gear through the mail because they wanted to pay me back
---
Fixed at the latest version (v1.7.3), you can update from Curse
---
Yeah I don't get that either. I was looking for a Scholo group and since LFG gets spammed to oblivion, I accidentally whispered a guy looking for dps for Uldaman, the convo went something like this
---
guy: LF1M dps Ulda
---
Me: 60 lock
---
bro: unfinished quests eh?
---
Me: oh sorry wrong person, damn LFG spam
---
dude: haha np
---
And that's it.
---
Maybe some ambitious individuals would do that, but the vast majority would still raid the entry level raids. Thunderfury alone will make ppl run MC till the end of days.
---
Wrong.  Supporting AddOns adds MASSIVE developer time.  Ghostcrawler (remember him?) said so when he was at Blizzard.
---
Without AddOns, Blizzard can change any UI code they want to at any time for any reason.  Nothing will be affected so everything is very easy.
---
With AddOns, Blizzard not only have to ensure their code won't be exploited by addons but also they have to be wary of changing the code because even a small change can break a whole raft of addons overnight.
---
Blizzard definite'y don't provide the game APIs to save on developer time.  They provide them because they know they can't please everyone and players LOVE customisation.  When you customise a game, you make it your own and that increases loyalty to the game.
---
I tried Star Wars TOR when it was first released and that didn't support any addons.  The developers at the time said addons aren't needed because they have developed the perfect UI.  But many players hated it (including me) and it was incredibly boring to see everyone's UI exactly the same in every single screenshot.  It made me feel like I was playing THEIR game, not mine.
---
But in Wow, I feel like I'm playing MY game.  My character, my choices, my user interface, it's all mine.  And that makes me and millions of others love Wow and that's why addons exist.
---
Ask any developer at Blizzard and they will laugh if you suggest that supporting addons for millions of players makes their life easier.
---
How do you feel about rare recipes that drop? Should people who only have the profession be able to roll or should everyone roll because it's valuable? I mean if a robe of the void pattern drops and there's a warlock tailor in the party I think it's a nobrainer that they get it. In my opinion it's the same with any rare recipe like flask recipes or enchanting recipes, but I've seen different opinions on this.
---
Is taking a pic of your monitor some kind of inside joke now?
---
Can you loot the books while in combat?
---
holy palas and shamans have it much worse when it comes to leveling
---
I’ve found this guide to be the most thorough with weapon progression. It has both MH and OH recommendations: https://shadowpanther.net/leveling.htm
---
Good. Fewer conservatives in my game is always good. Snowflakes wanna quit over this, let them.
---
Stoneform is great to vanish without bleeding effects! Great choice. :)
---
My GF played shadow. Convinced her to switch to holy since she didn't hold up in dps at all (and I also coudn't when I played her character). Since then I only met priests that did around my tankdamage. Except that ubrs run couple of days ago, there we had a shadowpriest who topped the meter. So, if you put in the effort and know what to do, it might be fine\^
---
Shadow priests. DPS warriors. Balance druids. Prot pallies. Fire mages. Hunters. There are no right ways to play wow wrong.
---
I’m like you. I can’t turn my back on my pet. I won’t turn my back on the Tiger that has been my constant companion in our adventures in Azeroth for more dps on a meter or some min maxing FOTM build. If that costs me a raid spot so be it, we’re a package deal because without Bubby at my side I am not a Hunter.
---
Don't understand the big fuzz about meme specs atm. It's not like they're abundant anyway. 
---
Our guild runs like 3 enhancement, 1 ele sham, 1 oomkin, 1 spriest and 1 feral druid and we 1-phased rag on our first kill with minimal consumables.
---
Maybe they think raiding is fun.
---
To be fair I never had an issue with bulk buyers. They usually don't take more then 24h to accept the CoD.
---
I'm kinda surprised, it seems like the realms have too much population to make reputations possible at the moment.
---
I suppose being a nice tank will get you a long way though, you're probably a tiny percentage of the realm in that regard.
---
I do 300 on rag with no pots and trashblade
---
Because they dedicate so much focus and time on a pointless video game.
---
If you aren’t making money on it, you are trying hard.
---
It really helps to figure out the "meta" routes for dungeons. Download method dungeon tools and import the routes from [raider.io](https://raider.io), thats the one most people use. And it gets better the higher the keys are that you're doing. 7-10 are the worst in my experience, after that it slowly gets better.
---
Unless you're jokered and literally only ground mobs from 0-60 its almost impossible to not be honored with your home faction, especially since you get spill over rep from doing quests until honored.
---
I bet youre a Gnome mage
---
Because the majority of people on here haven't raided in a semi-serious or accomplished guild and think that most leaderships just abuse loot-council for their own selfish purposes which in majority of the guilds isn't the case at all.  
---
Gearing everyone correctly and clearing content frequently and fast goes hand in hand, it's not like people will want to raid if they dont get counciled loot.
---
Council is the best system period. You gear people that deserve it and need it the most.
---
Not really that good for warlocks. You get the BRD quest ring and buy unicorn ring or underworld band. Should be fairly easy to have better rings by 60.
---
I usually just say any version of no and follow it up with 'gl tho!' usually gets a smile and a ty reply
---
I’m only 35 years old but I have a kid so I’m never rested. Idk what to do
---
Good bot.
---
Duh, right-click?  Lol.  That's been in the default UI forever.  If you're suggesting LTM should have a continuous scroll like Carbonite, well I'm glad it doesn't.  That's a nightmare for zooming in and out, it just takes too long.  It's very clever, but not very practical.
---
On a PVE realm? As far as I know you couldn't have an alliance character on a PVP realm sop that's kinda weird.
---
Dude tell me about it. This is my first time rolling tank, and once they realize I’m capable of playing my class/spec, they let me get away with talking so much shit.. I love it
---
Guess you have bad experience with it then. In my guild it usually leads to discussion about where to progress next ("ding 49, only couple of more lvls to BRD farm" "gz" x 5-8 "you can do early BRD already, maybe make a group").
---
Without socializing like this I don't see much point to being in a guild. I want to get to know the people I'm in guild with.
---
As for point two: Dun Morogh's location doesn't make sense near the equator, tanaris in the south doesn't make sense, having green lush lands (plaguelands), though now rotten, all the way North doesn't make sense.
---
Underrated comment.
---
Ive always wondered and always wanted to try if its possible to jump straight in front of wyrmthalaks room after an ubrs run. The distance between both bridges is too far but when looking down towards the other bridge to wyrmthalak, there is a ledge on the wall to the right which imo should be reachable with a priests levitate.
---
If that jump (or glide) is possible, you could just grab wyrmthalaks loot for free in \~3 extra minutes at the end of a full ubrs.
---
How do you feel is the ratio ally/horde on bloodfang eu?
---
I want to make a horde alt but idk which to pick =)
---
They are less dependend on a weapon, so there is that. But they still like to have nice gear and it is incredibly easy to get into a group as you can fill every role in any spec while leveling. Running instances as a druid is a lot of fun, so I'd run every dungeon at least once to get its quests done.
---
&gt; Still no idea what you are talking about. Got it.
---
Thank you for describing yourself so aptly. Couldn't have done it better myself. Thank you for that, at least you won't confuse people that don't know better with your misguided claims.
---
I think Phase 2 absolutely murders any lopsided population server. Opposing factions can only take so much flight point camping before they just jump ship and leave the game.
---
If it’s as bad as I think it’s going to be, I’m out. I play weird sporadic hours and I cba to get fucked on by death groups for an entire phase.
---
I picked Druid so I could tank/heal/dps dungeons/raids(in a way). Doesn’t hurt they can heal and stealth too. They might not be the best at stuff but I love how they can do most things well enough.
---
Who wants a cookie!?
---
Yesterday i was doing my first DM:N run, i needed head and offhand from the two last bosses. Guess what dropped and no one else needed it? :D It was nice to finish DM:N in one run :D
---
Tanked maraudon on my druid and later went to Sunken Temple, had the same healer in both dungeons and he said he rather I tank than any of the 2 warriors we had in our group. Also on Zandalar Tribe.
---
I see so many of the same comment and I think if anyone gave a shit about what you had to say there prolly wouldn't be any more phone pics
---
Not everyone has profession, but all rogues have lockpicking (and yet to see one who didn't level it up for personal reasons like chest runs or lockboxes). Gathering is paid skill used further, lockpick is free skill rogues get with levelling. Wrong thing to compare.
---
Furthermore, gathering is not a group skill like conjure water/food, buffs or, indeed, lockpicking. Picking up herb doesn't help the group any...lockpick allows the whole group to be rewarded (and almost always the loot ends up split if people are nice to eachother, e.g. often I got mana pots as healer even if I didn't win the chest because winner didn't need/couldn't use)
---
Good question, maybe Curse takes a day or more to add new projects
---
He's not saying you will only get a 5 dps increase. He is saying that the dps increase for most people will not be worth it if it means you havr to grind so much that you don't enjoy it anymore.
---
Honestly, yiu do not need full preraid bis, nor would you ever neer full bis to be relevant in a raid.
---
Did anyone say dead? I think they meant a huge drop and its certainly a lot les speople playing.  
---
But in major cities and for still quite a while yet the world will be alive.  
---
The core Classic lovers will stay forever
---
Is this a joke I am to druid to understand?
---
Sometimes in those situation I get sleepy and as soon as they fuck up,I totally forget to heal xD
---
I rolled tank after i realised most of the LFM/LFG's are waiting on Tanks and Heals, and even when they get them, getting some with even half a head on their shoulders is something every group needs and not every group will get, so thankfully is far from a thankless task
---
Why this constant jumping? Stand still and talk.
---
Yes, I see this too much when a group is going well.  A DPS starts thinking they should pull, and then many problems develop.
---
Why does it seem like you refuse to answer any the valid points being made?
---
It's in my link.  Ghostly Strike and Riposte are there as well.
---
Type "/dnd Not tanking today, but thanks for asking :)" or something similar when logging in. Then whoever whispers you will have that message whispered back to them automatically.
---
No spriest should be doing "subpar dps." They're not even bad in phase 1. Really. Unless you're in one of the top guilds in Classic, I'm probably outdpsing you.
---
Tired of misinformed people making misinformed judgments. Pservers had **incorrect** spellpower ratios for shadow priest abilities. I actually, you know, tested things instead of joining in on the "spec bad" chant.
---
&gt;looks great aside from the map.
---
Yeah, i would move the char and button thingy to the left edge and put map in middle there. It would even out the button area widths too.
---
How good are Druids at BGs at 60? I know low level Druid FC is meta but how about end game? Is a geared Druid or geared Prot warrior better at FC? I know guarding bases in AB would be great as a Druid
---
Wheres the pun for it to be funny?
---
That lock did nothing wrong lol
---
Ah okay
---
I caught up in all the hate spewing at me because I solo level.
---
My bad
---
This reminded me of the scene in Django where the dentist is talking to the speck brothers
---
Imagine getting wf stomped outta nowhere by this.
---
What does it mean in Swedish?
---
Completely ridiculous comparison.  Shestak is a UI - it changes everything just like ElvUI or any number of other UIs.  Leatrix Plus is a modular addon.  It does nothing whatsoever when you first install it and then only does exactly what you tell it to.
---
Also a quote from Shestak...
---
" All settings are changed in the file ShestakUI\\Config\\Settings.lua or in-game options(/cfg)."
---
LOL.
---
I have but then I see them stop logging on so i remove them
---
How is your guild raiding 3 days a week if you use flasks?
---
Even using it on your pc will hardly be trackable. Brothers under the same household using a shared PC.
---
They’re looking for accounts that have odd logins from the other side of the world, they won’t bat an eyelid at logins occurring under the same household/IP Address
---
no but lemme quote a saying a saw today on this subbredit
---
"slow is smooth, smooth is fast"
---
which summs up all my dungeon exprience in classic, going "slow" tends to give me better exp in the long ron
---
Go to kronofogden.se and complain!
---
Does this issie goes away for some time of you have turned off your pc? If yes your gpu is about to die
---
What the fuck are you talking about?
---
Take this with a grain of salt, but my dad and i have shared accounts for years both of us living in different states and nothing has ever happened other than a simple verification email. They don't really pay attention to that kinda shit unless it's like 100 different accounts per ip or visa versa.
---
Minimise wow and watch netflix, youtube etc. I've grinded from 57 to 60 with plaguelands zombies in vanilla, just because I wanted to watch TV instead of dungeons.
---
&gt;Save
---
my guildie got it on 94th
---
I honestly dont remmeber ever reading anything about classic dying after 1 month. But then again i am not an avid consumer of reddit, twitch or wow forums but then uet again what kind of person would you be to take anything seriously on those places anyway.
---
Pretty sure I've picked the BRD bar door..
---
still in denial. dont be so fucking naive. the playerbase is EASILY down 80%, and when naxx ends, I’m pretty sure thatll be closer to 90%. its honestly just pathetic to see people still get enjoyment out of this game, you must have a pretty miserable life if classic WoW post-60 is a satisfactory filler of your free-time. maybe i envy you guys for being so simple minded, i kind of wish i could just live on a farm tending to my cattle and crops and not yearn for more, so i think its actually pretty beautiful that players like you exist; its heartwarming. you are a very special person OP, don’t let anyone tell you otherwise 🙂
---
This is why I love being on a medium pop, Normal Oceanic server which the elitists will never in a million years give a single shit about.  Most of the obnoxiousness which gets mentioned in this subreddit, simply isn't something that I ever experience in game.
---
Can you tell me what addon for UI are you using? It looks real nice, especially the font and stuff
---
Wowhead
---
My testing likely agrees. I dualwield tanked p1 and had 50k threat going into p2, next highest was at 14k. 
---
I proceeded to solo soak 4 fireballs in the middle of the room before another target was selected. Speculating they each reduce 8-10k threat and meters don't reflect it.
---
im there as well, started with a friend(Alliance), he plays more retail than classic, i dont play retail at all.
---
right now leveling a mage, would love to find a nice, chill, mature, casual guild with people that care more about fun and laugh than about being the top in everything.  
---
soloing is getting tiresome, and im getting ganked a lot. would be cool to find some new friends to run with.
---

Firemaw EU. 
---
Aiming for 60 by mid November.
---
Both grinding and leveling are extremely boring to me, thats why i just do dungeons till 60
---
That's weird as I also use elvui and Shaman has always been dark blue for me, though I do think they were pink very early on before they fixed it.
---
Druid.  The biggest problem with druid tanking is that people are still ignorant, and don't believe they're viable.   I just tanked rag, and killed him, but yah w/e.
---
IMO wars still edge out druids for mitigation/avoidance.  Druids have the edge in raw health and physical reduction but that's it.  When you add in druid dodge vs war dodge/parry/block and a flat -10% dmg taken by defensive stance you don't take as much damage as a warrior although it can potentially seem spikier due to less health and armor mitigation.
---
I’ve never been that keen on mob grinding. But being my first time on a mage and spec’d for AoE it’s fun downing 5-10 mobs at a time, seeing the XP bar fill up pretty fast.
---
I’m level 41 and have made close to 200g just skinning all mobs and mining nodes as well as selling cloth.
---
Not everyone who plays WoW is tech savvy. It seems obvious to you, but some people don't read reddit and never had contact with an official Blizzard person so how the heck would they know? 
---
You're a dick
---
Whenever you encounter someone else who is in a similar situation, help them yourself.
---
How do you grind when you have wow minimized? :D smells like some botting is going on here.
---
If loot rules were stated beforehand in chat, you can report and get them banned. It's actually a bannable offense to not honor loot rules.
---
Easy solution, roll a healer and mob grinding will never be an issue for you.
---
Americans have their own version of English, that's how language works. One of the more pompous statements to say a country that Speaks English is bad at it.
---
Yes, but moon almost always means poly, unless there are no mages around
---
Each boss guard corresponds to an item in the chest. If you don't set up the frost trap, you get one less. The one which needs the ogre suit if you skip him, possibly also is responsible for one item not appearing.
---
Double mage stratholme service entrance is pretty decent.
---
I think it should be at the discretion of the rogue. I personally don't have a problem with them taking locked chests. You wouldn't impose that sort of thing upon miners or herbalists so why is it any different for a rogue?
---
I think it's nice when a rogue offers to unlock the chest for others but it shouldn't be expected. Besides, if wants it for himself you literally cannot do shit about it.
---
Not a rogue main.
---
I'm pretty sure that DBM tracks total kills
---
Did I fucking stutter?
---
If you've listened to any of the Countdown Priest episodes this is covered.
---
Should I hold onto Skin of Shadows?
---
Not for me.
---
The less I do the better. I love getting loot for zero work so if everyone does their job I'm a happy camper.
---
Shared Media :) Monserrat is the font I believe.

He just gonna be like "sorry can't open" then get it afterwards.
---
Ezpz. Just pop on a movie on a second screen and try to mimic like you're raiding or something. I've been mixing up quests and dungeons with some good old mob grinding in feralas. I'll usually do like 3/4 of a level on the mobs because they go down in like 20 seconds max. Plus I'm a hunter so I can also just atuoshot while I eat a snack or something. 
---
Maybe grinding mobs just isnt for you, and that's ok. If you're not having fun playing the game then you're not doing it right. I'm personally grinding the leather for money and the xp is just a bonus. I've done about 3 whole levels now though

I would have been absolutely livid. I've been trying to get that trinket for ages
---
Tanks I've ran with are usually the "start casting sheep on &lt;mark&gt; when I start the pull". Since the bowshot is quicker than the cast.
---
I think it depends on how long the fight is, given how much we are just burning the bosses down it is likely that the issue with spriest and boomies are hidden more than say longer fights where the dps just makes the cut.
---
Also, standards have changed. https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/statistics/1000/#aggregate=amount&amp;dataset=90 Yes, if you are talking about just raiding guilds in general then maybe you are right. Although I think right now, most guilds are going to be at least a little bit hard core, most players are in theirs 40s it seems by the LFG spam. 
---
If you are raiding right now, you are likely going to be counted in the top % of overall players, and as such are going to get those talks more often than not.
---
Bloodfang here too - PM your IGN if you are interested in some dungeons, healers here. And yes, it's nice when you recognize players from your leveling time and dungeons :)
---
His English is fine but for non native it can be quite labour intensive to be this good, so they avoid long conversations due to the effort.
---
Those stats aren't saying anything except that people don't know how to play shadow priest. It's like pitting a chess amateur against Magnus Carlsen and then claiming the amateur's seat is cursed when they lose.
---
So tldr time ss and evis just after mh lands? How about rupture?
---
As a fellow priest, no you don't. Any semi-competent mage, warlock, rogue or warrior will do more DPS than a shadow priest.
---
Well it can be boring but atleast you can do something else  while they do everything. I always put on some podcast or watching videos on youtube or series, chat with friends because sometimes it's realy boring. You have many options.
---
Get that dungeon finder attitude outta here. These are people that you *will* be interacting with again. There is a limit to how much you owe the other members of a pug group, but taking a tiny upgrade when it's a massive upgrade (or even bis) for somebody else is a dick move.
---
I want all trash loot if I should tank for someone outside of gilde. You need I pass. No one needs it goes to me. Everything under 20g+ value

Tauren named JohnBercow

Its the Healer+Tank that will demand that crap usually. 
---
I have a strict "one orb for tank" limit. Thats fine, if you want more, have fun playing with idiots.
---
You skill wandspec than spirit tap. After that all talents until shadowform are optional. You'd usually respec at 40 to get shadowform and than spec into wands again.
---
You have become micro famous my dude

You can't just ask people which mouse works for them and expect it to work just as well for you.  
---
Go to a physical store, feel some of them out, some stores even let you test them inside a videogame.  
---
(then go home and google where u can buy the one you like the cheapest)
---
Important things to think of when buying a mouse:
---
**1) HAND SIZE**
---
This is the most important, yet most forgotten one.  
---
For the average person, with average size hands most mice fit and you shouldn't worry about it. Hence why this is the most forgotten thing.  
---
But if you know that you have rather large or tiny hands, you should keep this in mind when buying a mouse.
---
  
---
Check the dimensions of mise, go to a physical store and actually test some out, get a feel of them.   
---
And if your local store doesn't have the exact mouse you are intrested in, look at the dimensions of the mouse that does feel nice and look for mice with those dimensions.
---
If you are intrested in a mouse with many bindable buttons/macro buttons, make sure you check the size and location of those buttons as well.  
---
I've held mice in my hand where the buttons were so close to the palm, you couldn't possibly ever use them efficiently.  
---
I've also held mice where the buttons were so small and close together that if you pressed one, you'd press 4 others at same time. 
---
**2) MACRO BUTTONS**
---
Are you actually going to use them?  
---
How many will you need?  
---
If you are only going to use 5 keys, there's no point in buying a mouse with 20 buttons because you will just get confused and 'misclick'.
---
Where do you need these buttons to be located?  
---
Most mice have macro buttons at the thumb, but others have buttons for the index/middle finger right next to the main left/richt click buttons and some others have even buttons on the ring finger/pinky.
---
**3) WHICH GAMES**
---
Well obviously WoW Classic... which can use a lot of macro buttons  
---
But maybe you will be playing other games like shooters for example.
---
Then it might be nice if you can adjust the weight/sensitivity of your mouse by the press of a button (or by adding some weights).
---
Does the mouse have an easy way of switching between profiles?  
---
So when you relog to an other account or start playing another game you can easily switch to that specific profile of macro keys.
---
AND LOCK IT ONCE YOU CHOSE.  
---
(nothing as annoying as changing profiles by accident in middle of a game and having all your keys messed up)
---
**4) ESTHETICS**
---
You have to be happy with your mouse.  
---
Do you like the way the mouse looks?  
---
Does it glow the way you like?
---
Is it neat like a logitech/Razer or do you want a transformer looking mouse like MAD CATZ?
---
What we have found most effective is when phase 3 is close, all dps stop entirely except hunters. All hunters and tanks stack and hunters go all out, she will target the hunters, as soon as a hunter is targeted they feign death. During this time all the tanks are trying to take aggro, usually goes through 2 or 3 hunters before being picked up by a tank, then dps slowly continues. Without using this hunter strategy she just seems to target anyone randomly regardless of damage.
---
Communication is key. At a certain value, I advice to let everyone roll need on it for selling. If anyone really needs it for himself, the negotiation starts - either he gets it for free, a discount or market price
---
Ha, jokes on them, I avoid reserved runs like the plague. (unless I do not need that particular item..)
---
I tend to assume they also do not see that it is +healing only. It's a differentiation one does not always spot.
---
Only because curse wasn't updated at that time :)
---
&gt; Everyone likes to shit on shaman tanks, and while not the best they are certainly capable. I once tanked and healed scarlet strath with four people and it went fine. Also once had a shaman tank Onyxia with no issues.
---
Made my way t'ill Naxx... so yeah.
---
They are insane in pvp. Hate them as a rogue lol
---
You should report them for scamming. Unless they ststed beforehand that the item was reserved, they cannot abuse the master looter system.
---
They are probably using **Monolith dkp** system, with static prices. With all system we have available, its most fair one.
---
**Loot council** is best to create drama, always will someone think that other guy got item because of his social status with loot council.
---
**Dkp bidding** was popular in old days, but people exploited it too much with burning dkp. Always ended with paying all dkp you have for item. Even if you put limit on max bid, you end up with most of people unhappy. 
---
**Dkp static**, has his flaws. As we used it, we tweaked it. For us is like this now:
---
New players gets starting dkp so they atleast have something to start with, and compete with others. 
---
We dont have much more ppl than needed in guild. So raid attendance is realy high 80% +. If you miss raid, you wont get item few runs **in theory**. But sooner or later someone spend dkp on other item, or is late for raid, or dont join raid at all, or something else. 
---
We also made list of arguable items, and wrote which class have priority over item, so people don't spend dkp on item which they don't need, or have better version for this phase. 
---
If you are new maybe things don't look good for you, but on bright side you might get items sooner than you expect. Because others probably already have it.
---
In this phase you only need patience, you will all be geared sooner or later, dont be loot whore, if someone have more dkp than you, it means he sacraficed more of private time to clear content with guildies.
---
Just stay in guild and wait for your time to come. 
---
Whole content is cleared in few hours anyway, and you will farm MC for months before BWL. 
---
When new content is out like BWL we will decay dkp for 70-90%. That way everyone will have same chance for items in new content, and ones which was active whole time will still be awarded by staying on top. 
---
Try to adjust dkp values so you cant earn too much dkp in 1 run. Good ratio would be like 1-2 items worth dkp per run. 
---
-If someone wants, can share him dkp values, and priority list. 
---
Good luck with drops. 
---
Vanilla Veterans - Stonespine
---
Can you do Angerforge run with 2 pople? Does that mean it is possible to sneak by the mobs to get there?
---
There weren’t many PuGs but I remember on my server all the raiding guilds would kind of come together and pool members for off content like ZG, AQ20, and sometimes MC when progression got in the way of reclears, or even just to do it on alts. It was cool cause you got to interact a lot with people from other raiding guilds and it created a lot of interactions between the different communities.
---
I love how you try to make OP out to be a gold buyer, when you just out yourself as a gold buyer and an extremely gullible person.
---
That is the most obvious phishing attempt I have ever seen. “Blizzards” LUL
---
And it has some CD aslo who could tell
---
Sm/Ruin for farming and also viable for raiding as one lock always have to put imp in Tank group for buff
---
No, I completely understand them. It was just a funny sociological observation that every single one seems to feel obliged to stay exactly one more run.
---
That sounds great, I will try this one! Thanks
---
Sure, I'm not entitled to it. Just feels bad. And the point of the story is that the guy I'm replying to had an item that wasn't very good for the other guy snagged from him when it would have been better, which is what I refrained from doing because it makes sense.
---
The raid leader writes "\[Item\] ROLL" just before the rolls. Could it be the rules you looking for?
---
Meh im getting boored now. Moving on to other games
---
&gt; I’ve tanked up to UBRS on mine. Only thing I hate is drinking so much and nature resist.
---
One thing I would suggest once at 60 is to carry an mp5 set while travelling from on mob to another as shown[ in this vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0-17Sp62eI). Many people are starting to do this to save on dungeon/raid down time.
---
I think that is the point of it.
---
I have really no problem if there is something else I need in that dungeon or I just go for fun. Otherwise I check for some other group.
---
I don't think I've ever done this, but...this is a pretty unnecessary comment, imo. 
---
It's super easy to politely decline, so it really does sound like a flex, despite your claims otherwise. It really should only serve as a compliment when this occurs.
---
Eyes of the beast and stay. How hard is it.
---
I know its strange, but it worked for me, I never use sinister strike with daggers, that is a loss of dps, its better to go around the tank and backstab it other then spending energy on ss
---
also the aggression is there for eviscerate damage since the dagger skills are "capped" with a single point on it with the +5 gloves (sure if you dont have it, than you put 2 points)  
---
capped here means that the diminishing return after 308 points has smaller impact.  
---
reaching the unbuffed 28% crit and changing to seal fate increase your dps by an other 20-30% (vs combat dagger or combat sword - if dont have the Viskag yet)
---
your defiantly right, this is just regional spelling, not me being bad at English at all.
---
Celebras good times, come on!
---
SM/Ruin is solid until you get enough +hit gear to switch to ds/ruin. 
---
Also SM/Ruin is better for solo farming overall, because of siphon life, coe etc.
---
Shadow does respectable dps at the moment and your character is all shadowy and spooky, it’s probably mildly entertaining to them to see a shadowpriest competing on the meters when reddit trolls always shit over the spec.
---
Yes it works
---
This is algamated data from Warcraft logs submissions. Why don’t you post some videos of how you do it (on Classic servers) and prove everyone wrong. If you know something then educate the community rather than making radical claims without evidence. I’m going to level a priest at some point and I would love to play it shadow but I’m not under any illusions that it’s going to top DPS charts.
---
People have found insane ways of making things like Ret Paladin work with huge amounts of work (Spelladin build), I haven’t seen anything like this for Priest. Here’s some numbers for comparison. 
---
Warrior. 	1,451.55
---
Rogue	        1,259.82
---
Mage             970.50	(frost)
---
Warlock.       842.21
---
Druid		717.88
---
Priest		631.54
---
Paladin	        472.82
---
I don't think I am disagreeing with you at all. I am trying to say that given that most fights in MC is over and done with &lt; 2 minutes (if not just around 1 minutes), a lot of the issues that mana intensive classes (spriest and boomy) is hidden.
---
Yes, in T1 this is going to be true if everyone else pulls their weight and then some, but if you get to a place where you have to put up with very long fights, this won't be true.
---
SPriest is very, very strong in short bursts, anyone who lvled with one questing should know that. That isn't the problem with them at all.
---
I love doing this as mage and seeing everyone else die.
---
&gt; Pretty nice. Most people at 60 I feel have the common sense to wait until they see a spell from you before attacking. At least on my server. The main hurdle is dungeons that have a hard aggro drop in them (IE: UBRS) you really need help with.
---
&gt; All the feedback I tend to get is people praising the AoE threat and making jokes about how relieving it is to not have a Warrior tank in dungeons. Outside of that, I do whelp tanking in Ony and add tanking in MC for the fights that need it. Both go fine, although Ony is the only one I get any notable praise for.
---
&gt; are people still in the AOE cleave mentatility?
---
&gt; If they are on your server, that's a good thing. Your specialty as a Prot Paladin is AoE threat.
---
&gt; Overall though, I would say Prot is pretty good as long as you (And your group) are mindful of those struggles. I've not had a downright bad experience with it yet.
---
&gt; Personally I run https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/550001-053201335001521-05004
---
I've been doing something very similar. Also the spec is the one I use  :)
---
I’m fine with spending more on crusader every 15 levels  if it’s a significant increase from fiery
---
BoE rule is just fair.
---
Rasist!
---
Actually saw someone advertise multiple Scholo/Strat runs with Corruptors reserved smh.
---
Edgemasters have been around 400-500 gold recently. Doable,  but Muggers Belt is arguably free. Just takes some dungeon runs. 
---
Lets put it like this: fury prot only benefits maybe the top 5% of guilds. Its long term prospect, for me as well. It also seems to 'trigger' a lot of old school players. I'm even having to defend the notion that tanks can/should use daggers to some of the older rogues in my guild.
---
&gt; The sheer fact you're paying real life money for it completely erodes any desirabiity.
---
You are paying money for any and all things in the game though...  Directly or indirectly.  Long grind for a mount well you paid a sub, payed gold (has real world value), bought the game and invested time (time is definitely money).  You just paid a different kind of money.
---
&gt;verb: minimise  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;reduce (something, especially something undesirable) to the smallest possible amount or degree.
---
nice that you can quote a dictionary :D but minimise on computer means  putting your app on the taskbar and not having it visible. You even know you were supposed to call it windowed mode, yet you still cant accept the mistake i called you out on :D
---
That’s when you start taking tips or asking for greens from the run.
---
You could start to dps the mobs as well. At least that's what our healers always do. Speeds up the dungeon a bit more.
---
can confirm. this happened to me today in strat UD. and we had a 59 hunter so he aggros from further away. faster to just clear packs. who knows. we may get some loot
---
Mage.
---
Yes, the loot rules was roll for the item. To be honest, I would have been ok if they said something like, we're giving this to our guildie because f u thats why, but to say roll and after ignore it, that is bad :(
---
You seem pretty easy to anger and that's just by reading this thread, I'm not trying to be mean or psychoanalyze you but just be aware of how you come across to people online and problems you have (that everyone has variations of) that might push others away
---
&gt; Finished leveling with a maye for the night and jumped on an alt to hit 20, im halfway through 19 and i see a group advertising for heals WC. Get an invite - 24 warrior tank, 16 rogue, 17 shaman, 18 shaman. I chuck my resto set on my shaman and go to heal. Everyone is attacking from the front, no totems going down, tank isnt turning mob around, tank cant hold threat. 3rd pull is huge and 2 people die. Give a couple of pointers (e.g. try and attack the mobs from behind) and off we go again. Next pull is massive again, 2 people die after i go through my full mana compliment + a mana pot, 2 dps take damage equovalent to 4 times theor health pool each. Rogue offlines, we havent killed kresh or anaconda, group dissolves.
---
&gt; I see another group, get an invite. 29 priest, 19 hunter, 22 mage, 19 rogue, and me. We plan on pet tanking but i show off my rockbiter + Earth Shock skills. Everyone is super hectic, but doing appropriate stuff. Polys going off with no one hitting them, chain pulling packs, everyone on their game doing what needs to be done in the situation. No discussion needed, no marking, cc's not being broken, group adapting and keep pulling if someone stops to drink up. Very enjoyable, until the priest had something come up and had to drop group half way through.
---
&gt; The worst WC i have ever run, immediately followed by the most fun WC i've ever done.
---
I'd suggest reading this if you ever plan to shaman tank again, helps a lot https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=1150
---
I needed this! Downloaded thanks!!
---
Guys some people come and check these videos and think that a class is broken, or that this is easy. I'm gonna let you know that this here is dozens of hours practice, hard work and learning. We're even now blessed with the super-powers of the internet and quick sharing. Imagine  what took Dysphoria for the initial kill!   
---
Anyway, I want to point a few things most people who haven't tried this with their hunter are not gonna know. There is TONS of RNG during this in terms of Patrol positioning. Also not every safe spot is a "true" safe spot. I've found that there are 3 true safe spots until reaching king and everything else is semi-safe (meaning bad RNG or timing will get u killed for sure).   
---
* When he makes the first pet pull and runs up the ramp there could be an Ogre elite on the bottom of the ramp, there could be an Ogre elite on the top of the ramp, there could be anywhere between 2 and 4 more mobs patrolling the courtyard (Including boss) or the door you have to reach.
---
* When he reaches the frost trap area the boss there was luckily near the staircase so he could straight jump on the bones and the wall (didn't know that was possible btw, tnx). If the boss was near the frost trap he would need to FD somewhere else where it is "semi-safe", stand up wait for FD cd to be ready, move to bones and make the jump. 
---
* When he FD next to the stairs, he was left at 1,3k hp. One-two extra hits, or random charge from the boss would have killed him. If he dies without AotC he won't be able to run up fast enough in Invisibility to pass safely the second pack. The issue there is that FD cd also won't be up so he can straight die unless manages all survival CDs in a safe spot while waiting for FD. 
---
* When he reaches hyenas he is actually very unlucky that from the 5min route that patrol has, they are exactly where he is going. However, he manages to salvage the situation. 
---
* When killing King there are also random stuff that can happen. Mage can fear your pet, or decide that every cast should be a 1.5 sec Mind Blast instead of a fireball. King can charge you post FD and guarantee you a new run. Biggest rng bug I've seen is for King to get aggro on me randomly after i FD+Drink. ***Not sure but this might be due to switching Aspects.***
---
Much respect for him to be able to adapt on the fly to all the random stuff happening during the run. I'm getting there :) still haven't made a deathless run up to King but here is a few tips that I don't find many people sharing.   
---
1. Night-elves have it A LOT easier than all other races due to shadowmeld. That ability alone let's you FD pretty much anywhere and safely wait out the CD. This is NOT THE CASE for other races. You need to be very deliberate where u FD and learn (by trial and error usually) which places are "true safe" and which are "semi safe". 
---
2. Most difficult part of the run is near the frost trap boss guy. There are a few ways to proceed here (jumping on bones is one of them), however I found out that with a **Gnomish Cloaking Device** you get to pass that part "for free" once every hour. I FD at wall in front of bones. Wait for boss to pass my LoS and I stand up. This is to start the CD resset on my FD. When I have 10 seconds left I just use the trinket and "safely" FD somewhere at stairs. 
---
3. Mark patrols in the Courtyard. If you die and corpse run, there is no chance of understanding who is where and when they will come near you. Having the marks really helps you re-run that zone safely.
---
Open a blizzard ticket
---
Meh I would also say OT as well.  You can never guarantee your MT isn't going to jump ship and there are enough fights where a 2nd tank is needed and often they are dealing with multiple adds.  3rd one though sure.
---
Oh shit. You do some serious damage. Maybe I need to give shadow in raids a try. I usually hate shadow in PvE (I love it in PvP, though).
---
Yeah, it took approx 40 runs to get it. I had the first one drop in the 4th or 5th I think, thats when the mage nagged it. So it forced me to spend some time.
---
At the bright side however, I now had a legit reason to help my friends far HoJ! Which they got three of before I saw my Trinket heh. Still, I got it now. No harm, no foul.
---
Not that you would buy it for, we aren't talking about rebuying the same fucking item you dunce.
---
On my server, I can vendor the axe from Rotgrip for 4 gold 29 silver. I can buy Julie's Dagger for 4 gold, which is an upgrade.
---
By your logic, clearly I am entitled to need on the axe from rotgrip so I can buy an upgrade for myself.
---
what a game changer. Thanks man.
---
Cleanest race for sure.
---
Wash yer back!
---
So why not a surv hunter?
---
doesn't \\cast Auto Attack work?
---
it should toggle on and off the auto attack
---
Shift to downrank doesn't work in any case with this unfortunately
---
Melee hits you 90% of the time, regardless of you being +20-30 levels above the mob.   
---
Magic is however 95% resisted.   
---
Melee damage is also scaled wrong. A 32 melee mob hits you as if you were level 32, not 60. Test it out yourself as a 60 in RFD, SM, or anywhere else.  
---
I remember being able to boost in SM in vanilla, without much issue because the mobs hit me for 1-20. Go in there now and 14 melee hits later you are dead.  Magic attacks seems to be working the way they are supposed to.
---
During Legion had a friend play hunter and he multi shot in that dungeon where you kill the wolf and there are elite dragons flying overhead that never aggro because of how high they are. We were fighting a pack and he of course multi shot and somehow it hit that freaking dragon
---
People are just grooming you to be their pocket tank.
---
I imagine the player had a few Druids innervate them. Would be really interesting to know how this persons does it.
---
SW:P on all the things, I assume.
---
Reserving Shit is pretty normal. So you know many gruul runs there we're with the trinket in Res? Dont cry, make your own groups If you re butthurt about it. Lazy peon
---
Yeah, I try to be kind enough to let DPS have prio if its only a small upgrade for me.
---
Spellpower legs dropped in LBRS from Highlord Omokk (Think thats his name), but I passed on them since I knew I would replace them with the legs from Fineous sooner rather than later.
---
The same reason why I pass on crafting recipes if I know we got a crafter who wants to learn the recipe instead of just selling it on the AH.
---
The other players dont seem to agree though, seeing as its full on need roll galore when Fire Protection or any flask recipes drop.
---
The timing works...
---
Beg like crazy for people to let you have it.  Then AH it like a boss.
---
not (always) true. I sell stuff from my lvl 1 bank alt all the time, and it's always well below market price and current AH price.
---
granted, I always got it even cheaper, but it's still a good deal for the potential buyer who missed the initial even lower cost :) but like, right now I'm selling 2x Staff of Jordan for 130g each in trade chat, usual price is over 250g on my server.
---
And you knew exactly what he meant but you still wanted to accuse him of botting
---
Rofl. I usually get 1-2 per run but if I get to the last boss and I haven’t won any I ask the group if I can need on it cause rep is the only reason I’m there. 16k/21k. Can’t find any info on the tabard but I am hoping it’s available at exalted
---
I think there are quite a lot of nice things in retail, that are just badly done.
---
Like the "barber shop" - it would fit perfectly into the world, was is about beards and hair. Not a complete facial reconstruction...
---
Even the group-finder would be cool - were it not for x-realm. 
---
Transmog? Nice Idea, but that overly magic switch anything to everything is just not 'in the world'. 
---
The questreward-system that gives usable items is nice. Where it not for leveling being more of a downgrade with the relative level of world vs gear getting worse...
---
Overall, there is just too much outer-wow-ly things in retail, it spoils the whole thing. Too much of the basic world that can not be explained **within the game world**.
---
Just a bit afraid about my first dungeon as a tank 😅
---
But thanks for the advice.
---
U said it in ur post that u didnt have a goal and are just grinding gold or xp. Ive done a shit tonne of grinding this time around and hasnt felt too boring. Eg pre 53 i wanting to groind mobs so id have money for devilsaur when i dinged or something to work towards other than just a blankett xp/gold
---
Do you have any links to this information? Would love to become more informed on this stuff.
---
Still the 2-hour queues on a weekday evening on my server...
---
Hopefully we will be able to transfer from Hydraxian Waterlords.
---
What unit frame add-on is it that? Cheers
---
Tryhard is the correct term and is being used accurately in that context
---
The thing is that a shadowpriest has to prepare more and work more for pushing high dps than pure dps classes do, but that player will end 95% of his dungeons as #1 on the meter and will be high up there in raids.
---
I’m nothing special and I’m walking out of UBRS runs in 1 or 2nd place on the meters, usually with the same overall dmg done as prebis mages with some MC pieces, after an entire instance of nothing but AOE pulls.
---
A mage putting alot of effort into his class will beat the shit out of his fellow mages, but some of us just love being spookyboys...
---
The DPS increase for most people will absolutely be worth it because most people are either average or bad at the game and need gear to carry them as much as possible...
---
Sure, you don't NEED anything, you can be a leech while expecting for people who farmed gear to carry you. Being relevant in a raid depends on your brain, not gear. But as I said earlier, most people are either average or bad so they'll need the best gear possible to not be seen as useless.
---
damn, I think I fell for this several times without even knowing what it was about. Just yesterday I was selling a Staff of Jordan for 130g, and a guy asked me to CoD to him. Lowest in  the AH at the time was 150g. Guess I can probably expect it to come back in 3 days. The joke is on him though as I still have another SoJ to sell :)
---
also 3/4 of the time I C.o.D. something it doesn't get picked up, so I think I'll just start refusing it outright.
---
😂😂😂
---
I was hoping this would become a meme one day.
---
Amazing. I'm also on bloodfang and the same happened to me. Im a pretty low level so was helping some guys out, others help me. The next day I meet a random 60 and he was like "hey, it's me from yesterday, we played together right". 
---
Whilst I'm playing I'll get random messages to come dungeon or something because I was good at my role. 
---
Apart from the horde, bloodfang is pretty fun
---
No u
---
r/wooooosh
---
As an orc I can say that you can in fact lock pick that gate.
---
Weird fetish, no doubt
---
And it definitely sounded like a serious accusation :D
---
Spam ZF until 46-47 and then do some quests in Hinterlands or other less popular zones. ZF and STV are gank havens.
---
Yeah man, been running Mara for awhile and it is really comfortable, easy, and chill!
---
Your alchemy transmutes should be worth some decent passive income though so not a total loss.
---
out like a light man
---
Thanks! I can see why they would be wary of them then. Lol
---
It dropped 4 times in 60 runs but i lost the 3 first rolls. The feeling you get when you finaly get it is so good.  I love my hoj so much.
---
Alright, thank you all for help! :) I will try to help him a bit and see what happens
---
Dont be a wimp without self Control is a good start
---
Also killing mobs that drop fast and dont have u eating every few kills high tempo is key. I been farming mobs 5 or so levels lower but droppung them quick
---
again, green =/= blue =/= epic
---
ffs if you don't have the cognitive capacity to understand the difference, you're a lost cause.
---
Yeah this is really good information. The Phase 2 to 3 transition is the hardest part of the fight and this is super helpful info.
---
People fail to realize how lucrative the trash truly is. Each trash mob has a chance of dropping a key, which will unlock the goblin's shackle and he gives you patterns as a reward. 
---
One of which is hide of the wild, the best healing cape until late BWL.
---
People can try to be as "CLEVER" as they want. A smooth clean run will far outpace any run that is attempting to be clever.
---
Warlocks are gods at soloing
---
Ever heard of debuff slots? You guys are decent if you're allowed to take 2-3 / 16 slots just for 1 shadow priest. Rogues don't take a single slots. 
---
'' Tired of misinformed people making misinformed judgments. '' 
---
Go inform yourself.
---
Participation really plummeted on my server (out of 41 people in my guild, only 10 are still active), but there were so many people to begin with that it doesn't matter.
---
Turns out that the whole layering stuff did work wonders. I'm happy classic is thriving.
---
It's most fun when they also searching for tank/healer. Reserving is a guild or high demand role activity, not an option for freaking hunter lol.
---
played druid literally forever, everything about the class is perfect for me. mobility, able to play all roles, dots. i love it all.  
---
i actually attempted to play hunter this time around til 40, realized my mistake and rerolled druid. my fault for trying something new :(
---
Is there a way to unsummon a warlock's pet?
---
Probably my magnum opus  [👌](https://emojipedia.org/ok-hand-sign/)
---
Everytime Ive done UBRS we've had a resto druid who kept topping people off all the time.
---
Let me do my big heal please!
---
Only time I could shine was when shit hit the fan and resto druid had tunnel vision and couldn't keep up with all the damage.
---
Weirdly every single person I know that started playing classic is still a daily player. Most of these are guys who are married, have kids, all work full time+overtime jobs; but everyone still finds at least an hour or two a day to hop on.
---
instead of linking the most downloaded mods, some actual lesser known
---
\-Adibags, the ability to stack up items and make custom categories is too precious to ever give up.
---
\-Explus, a little lightweight addon that shows the % of level exp you got from last exp source (mob, quests), how much is left on level, and an estimated kills until next level (though i dont use this), its nice cause it shows that every mob is actually progress, in a way i dont think exp bars normally do.
---
Basically you've found a guild that lets you use 3-4 debuff slots.  Congratulations your dps is likely hurting the raids dps and is probably still not optimal.  Raids are super easy and any spec should be allowed to come, but obviously none of these specs have any place in an optimal raid configuration.
---
Yes I was wrong, sorry.
---
But what makes you think you deserve the gear? Just because you can equip it?
---
It took the whole group for that to drop, the whole group deserves a chance at getting it. 
---
The game isn't balanced around every person having an epic BoE. you can more than complete the games content via the BoPs. The BoEs are a bonus and, as such, are a vanity item. Because, and let me be clear, **they are not required to clear the content**
---
For me the key is to mix activities. Do a round of questing, do a dungeon (I did each at least once for the quest run, and some with many good drops multiple times - as a rogue RFD and ZF specifically), a bit of grinding, a bit of profession leveling, a bit of world pvp...
---
go for it, since you are not able to differentiate between BoPs and BoEs have a fucking blast
---
Pull more. My tank usually looks at the DPS we have in a group and adjusts mobs numbers accordingly.
---
If we have mana at the end of the fight, it means we can do bigger pulls.
---
Are you saying in school they give you a bit of an inferiority complex that makes you think your english isn't great
---
Gonna be unpopular to say around here but im growing tired of  classic because thousands of games are funner and dont require a mo thly subscription. My friends and I had dreams to play together but our schedules never line up so its gone from a fun game to play with my friends to just WoW- maybe the biggest time waster on earth.
---
Jesus christ I almost corrected you.. Nice
---
What's this 2 hour window thingy?
---
I have got it down to this, which has 9 characters remaining. But no showtooltip modifier, and no nodead (adding nodead stops shift mouseover from working)
---
\#showtooltip Flash Heal
---
/use \[mod:shiftalt,@Scio\]Flash Heal(Rank 1);\[mod:alt,@Scio\]Flash Heal;\[@mouseover,exists,mod\]Flash Heal(Rank 1);\[@mouseover,exists\]Flash Heal;\[mod:shift\]Flash Heal(Rank 1);Flash Heal
---
Dbm shows your number of kills in chat After a boss
---
It was a 2 handed mace, not a sword.
---
I would like to eventually get into solo farming East but from what I have seen online you have to be SM/DS with current gear levels in this phase. I also don't have mining at 300 which I believe contributes to quite a bit of the gold per hour.
---
I like this
---
See, I have no issue with killing (or getting killed by) the opposite faction when we're at popular farming spots or where quest-targets spawn. That's what a PvP realm is about. But I do occassionally help the opposite faction, especially if it's a lone player, achieve their questobjectives, like killing NPCs around escorts or assisting them take down an elite.
---
It's the pure venomous behaviour of corpse-camping or killing the escort over and over and over again which I can't stomach.
---
Isn't that something you could say about anything? what's the point of investing time in hobbies if you are not getting any money out of it?
---
Just don’t inviter hunter and rogues, lol
---
Not sure if its a bug or if it has been fixed but ... fireball (including splash) will only drop the threat of the person lowest on the agro list.  So if your MT got hit + at least 1 other person those 4x then his threat didn't change and that is why.
---
Obviously people make mistakes, but how are you going to learn if no one corrects you?
---
I feel the opposite. Joined a strat living run the other day where the 4 other members was in the same guild. 2 hand tanking, a level 58 fury warrior and a mage that could not get the timing of his novas right. There was even a rogue as well. 
---
The 58 warrior and the mage took huge amounts of dmg (I was almost OOM a couple of times, and im almost full prebis).
---
Baffled me that the didnt want to Sap or sheep. They had bad gear all of them, and applying a bit of structure would have made it 100 times easier. 
---
What I enjoy the most is:
---
\- A tank taking moderate damage (After all I want something to do)
---
\- Dps waiting for the tank to get aggro, so I dont have to heal every member just as much as the tank
---
\- CC if the dps/gear/aggro management is bad
---
\- A decent pace. Just as long as the tank lets me get +60% mana before each pack, its fine.
---
I dont think it is asking that much. But... The above only applies for 30% of the groups im in.
---
I’ve seen people say that somehow sm ruin is better when short on hit rating and I just don’t see why. Most people ain’t going to be doing corruption in raids so the afflic spells resistance talent seems only to be good for applying your curse which last 5 min anyway?
---
Yup. Been doing this.
---
32 days in here and still counting!
---
This game will always have a special place in my heart.
---
I played on private server for a decade and now I am finally playing on an official server! There is no way I am not enjoying this until the end!
---
Also depends on the group. If they are inexperienced but willing to take advice or generally nice folks, I am way more willing to stick with the group. Managing to get a group of level 50 players that have no clue what they are doing through ST is emotionally rewarding in a way that no smooth dungeon run could possibly emulate.
---
I love saving the day when that happens.
---
Popping my runes, pots and everything. Super fun when stuff actually happens.
---
Eloquent and ineloquent refer to language
---
Ha I used to be in barrens safari club
---
Own version of English doesn’t completely rape words though.
---
Google translate is getting pretty great...
---
It is equal.
---
If you find a wallet on a street, does how much cash is in it determine if you keep it? Don't think so.
---
Basing what is the right thing to do on an items value is being hypocritical.
---
At least you as a healer get better trinkets down the line, one of them a BiS guaranteed from the DM book. 
---
That warlock won't get a better belt for months.
---
Yup, because the threat api wasn't released until WRATH where threat meters would function off mechanics that lower aggro like ony. Right now threat meters are based COMPLETELY off the combat logs
---
&gt; but minimise on computer means putting your app on the taskbar and not having it visible.
---
Says who? Minimize is a perfectly valid word for making a window smaller.
---
&gt; I'd never roll Rogue on a PVP server, the sheer amount of competition is insane, they rival Warrior numbers.
---
I mean no they don't.  There's WAY more mages than rogues.  Mages rival warriors for numbers for sure, rogues are not that populated.  Lots of people make rogues at low level but not so many of them get to 60 imo.
---
Hmm this thread is pretty telling.  200 upvotes with comments like this.  The sub is a buncha apes
---
Tank lfg (gold reserved +10g/wipe) 😂
---
They feel like the mobs belong to them, while you need them for quests. That's why I most of the times screw up their farm by breaking their frost novas, fearing their mobs, etc.. They die or flee which buys me some time to get the kills I need for the quest.
---
**Horde - EU - Mograine - PvP**
---
Level 39 rogue looking for an active leveling guild.
---
There really isn't any of it, I just tested it all myself and ran the numbers. Wowhead's guide is just wrong about almost everything (except talents, their raiding talents are decent).
---
General rules:
---
-Stack spell power. A lot of your BiS is going to be "of Shadow Wrath" green gear. 
---
-Don't prioritize intellect. You really don't need a massive mana pool because Anathema provides so much base intellect. The only time you want to consider intellect is before you have anathema, and only if you're going oom consistently. Even then, you're just considering it -- SP usually wins.
---
-Don't prioritize spirit. Anathema solves this issue.
---
Here's a link to a screenshot of one of my spreadsheets that shows the ratios and some other assorted things. 
---

Keep in mind that the damage bonuses shown are purely single target. In practice, you could use talisman and then dot 8 different targets to get the full effect of it (the damage bonus of the talisman stays after the effect disappears). Also, it should be 5 SWP ticks since it doesn't hit for 3 seconds after application. Oops. Just use it as a guide, not a law.
---
This is also all unbuffed, and with relatively low spell crit chance. I'm confident that someone better than me could do much higher numbers.
---
Priests have 7 healing abilities not even counting downranking, of which all are very useful in their own right and not just "once per dungeon if things go south" spells. A priest who just spams one button is a really bad priest.
---
Same here. I’ve got a degree in English literature, non native, quite fluent, but in parties I write like a 4 yrs old
---
Was that you looking for someone else looking for RFD?  Just make your own group man.
---
The math only works with cookie cutter meta builds. For people with "un-bis" talent builds, the "bis" equipment lists are not optimized. 
---
Taking BiS weapons at 60 does you know good if that weapon is a sword when you're running some tricked out mace stun spec. Or you're a boomkin using +arcane dmg stack.
---
BiS flies right out the window as soon as you deviate from bullshit meta builds.
---
Hey!
---
I have 32 days of /played and a healthy life. I am just logged in all day because I am in charge of a very large guild. I work from home full time which allows me to do so.
---
I am just AFK with sound on to be aware of eventual whispers!
---
I still sleep 9 hours per night, watch Friends with my wife and walk my dog for 1.5 hours every day. ;)
---
Why does a mob sometimes turns its back when I Gouge it as a rouge?
---
It's very convenient cause I don't have to walk around to Backstab so I was wondering if there's any rule to it at all?
---
oh man that sucks i joined a group and we got 3 rings in 4 runs
---
Right click the pet's frame and press dismiss
---
Isn't rocket helm BoE?  Don't think you need to be gob to use, just to make.  I was -never- gob in vanilla and totally sure I had one.
---
what an idiot
---
We should open a sub r/wowpartychats
---
I needed Earthslag Shoulders my first time in brd. They lasted me almost until 60. If you don't get the shoulders from ZF a 13str 8sta plate shoulders are most likely an upgrade.
---
Shamans were pink in vanilla, same as paladins.
---
Arent there discords for this server drama shit?
---
People have to start seeing this - if you just want the ring with no bullshit, pay a warlock to 20-30g for boosting you. I've been running Mara over 300 times at this point on my warlock, and always I get the same sob stories "Oh, I've been trying to get it for weeks, but I always get ninja'd" etc etc.
---
Just pay a bleeding warlock, 5 runs in less than 40 minutes, chances are you'll get it, but if you don't you're usually only out the time it takes to do half a Mara run with a pug group.
---
Make life easy on yourselves and just pay a warlock.
---
(Not sponsored by the warlock Mara-farming community)
---
Real test - 8.3 and 9.0 
---
Will content/progression pace keep classic players? Or will they split their time? Is Classic just like a new expansion and peak at the start and dwindle to trickle but without a new expansion to bring people back?
---
These are my questions.
---
You're idiotic. Projecting internet grammar to all of Americans is a weak argument.
---

---
I mean... he isn't wrong a warlock will do twice what the shadow priest does with similar gear.
---
No matter what spec you are.. if you never leave one stance you're not playing your class correctly.  That's like a ret pally who plays like a warrior or an ele shaman who thinks he's a mage
---
He’s just saying he’s bad in chats while tanking
---
They should - that's the original colour for shamans.
---
God damn retail players!
---
NO CHANGES
---
Jesus Christ, I almost corrected you...nice.
---
Work on your English, bud.
---
Uhhh fury warriors are the best dps in vanilla because they scale with gear/stats better than any class in the game. This isn't even debatable, it  is math...
---
What is your in game name? Im om Bloodfang Horde too
---
"Make Shamans Blue Again" even though shamans were originally pink in vanilla.
---
Im very happy to have paid for +5 damage on my alliance arms warrior. Costs about a gold, adds to DPS quite nicely.
---
bought the arcanite for 5 gold on AH first few weeks before people became aware of it
---
Says the computer...  Hover over the line next to the box and the X in the corner of your screen. It's called Minimize
---
Same here. All my IRL are still playing. We are actually one more since we could convince him to play as well a few weeks ago.
---
On classic?
---
Try and clicking the minimize button and lets see if it makes your screen smaller or if it puts it onto the taskbar :D
---
I recall fishing in Hillsbrad, near the farm house where the hostile human rogues are at. A warrior about 5 levels lower than me charges at me, so I just windfury my fishing rod and manage to kill him with a lucky crit. I think that was the power of Nat Pagel watching over me and my fishing.
---
I've sort of been *the* guy organising raiding in my guild, and people seem to be aware of that. We run MC on saturdays and I get whispers quite often from people I've never talked to about joining as a pug. It's nice to have that feeling.
---
A: You actually didn't two twice as much.
---
B: My raid didn't aoe them down -- we sheeped half and I actually LOST most of my dps since I could only dot 4 targets. I also lost that sweet, sweet sapper charge damage you got.
---
Congrats, you disproved yourself.
---
I guess convincing others to give you PI is a skill, yes
---
I wonder sometimes had each expansion been totally separate games with an option to character copy over, they would have done far better.  The number of subs lost over the years is phenomenal and while I acknowledge Wrath was peak subscribers, I also wonder how many of those were good sellers and multiboxers.  For me, even though I enjoyed TBC and Wrath, I still firmly believe pre-ZG Vanilla was the best era of the game.
---
Man I feel your pain.... my guild merged with another and I just wanted to be at least OT.
---
I’m like the 4th choice tank in the guild and it’s kinda getting me down realising I’m probably gonna be sidelined for a while. The sad thing is I like the guild and my guildies I guess I’m gonna have to just suck it up ;( 
---
All the best for the future though bro.
---
I always carry a stack of Advanced Target dummies on me.  You normally loot 1/2 the items they take to make off each one, sometimes closer to 90% and every 3-5 a fused wiring which sells for 3-5g.  
---
I've had dummies save a lot of pulls gone awry.  Make 10 and give em a try, they pretty much always pay for themselves.
---
The drawback being it makes raiding harder for you and getting loot even worse
---
I can paste my weakauras which shows whether you have totem up, its cd and if you are in range or not (greyed if you are out).
---
I don’t though cos I have friends and a guild 🤷‍♂️
---
also my thoughts on first view!
---
"oh nice, a new developer pictu--- ah no, custom interface in wow"
---
Any advice on respeccing late game? 
---
Leveled my paladin prot and was always aware I'd be healing end game, should have been fine as the intention was to comfortably gear up with a group of friends, who for one reason or another have all dropped off the game. 
---
Now I'm left at 60 still prot and no real healing set. Just wondered if anyone had advice on how the best way to gear a totally new specc would be? Really killing the game for me right now as my only option seems to be tank and pray the healer will give me any cast offs.
---
i play as i played back in vanilla! never ever reading quests, and maybe after 30min - 1h wondering why i cant finish that quest, i check the questslog for wtf is going on
---
works like a charm so far  
---
\- because thats what heroes do!
---
Wasn't me, just looking at a 99% warlock vs a 99% shadow priest on the same fight.   The other fights have warlocks regularly hitting 800+.  Shadow priests do not.
---
Yeah, he's doing pretty good indeed.  I'm 53 on my Warrior with 6 days 8 hours played.  I leveled no less than 5 Warriors to 60 on private servers so I kinda know what I'm doing.  In my defense, I am going without a quest tracker and I'm 250 mining/250 engineering atm so not exactly going for a personal record.
---
When you burst your pet will never hold aggro. Use feign death and level the spot of your pet helps alot.
---
Generally speaking the answer to the question "Can we skip these?" is always "No!".
---
Nah, but you barfed up your laughable excuse of a personality all over the  comments section. We get it, you're edgy.
---
Daggers isn't his main spec though, so by the rules, he doesn't get it.
---
ty!
---
Water my friend, water...
---
**Remember when pro-vanilla fascists were bashing Stormwind AFK'ers? about that....**
---
We've had the same warlock fireballed up to 6 times back to back, it's def not a total threat wipe.
---
Nah man, skipping trash was always a thing, even in Vanilla.
---
Guild runs i understand.  
---
Reserving every little shit is normal for greedy manchild beggars that needs to be spoonfed.  
---
Probably never really got into any drama because we don't act like entitled twats.
---
If its locked, they can take it, if we happen to clear path to it anyway.
---
It is much appreciated though when rogue says he will open it and asks everybody to roll.
---
They typically do this extra salt filled kind of shit
---
Lmao bullshit, you would not have been ok with that and we would probably see a post on reddit about it. Next whining post,please!
---
Damn does this apply to things which were looted wrongly. E.G tome of Tranq shot
---
Yes when you have titan panel
---
In other words, _don't_ stick to that rule unless everyone agrees to it.
---
This triggered me more than it should have... Have an undoot.
---
[Ask and ye shall receive.](https://youtu.be/CBttHicGbek)
---
Yea basically a guild run with randoms as extras. Guild gets all the boe's, recipes, eye, binding etc
---
Troll min/max for PvE MT but if DPSing then pretty sure orcs will still win out with blood fury + axe racial.  Could be wrong though.  Taurens just look better.
---
it's when the run is mostly guild, but they don't have enough members to make a full guild run, so they fill with PUG's
---
Prepare more and work more? Every caster dps can use the same consumables, and mashing mindflay button isn't much harder than spamming frostbolts.
---
holy crap...you know, it didnt even occurred to me to try right clicking the pet's portrait. that's how rusty i am.  
---
Thank you!!
---
Did I see seathorium charge for the upstairs door before last area? Do you need engineering for this, is there another way through?
---
How much more broken can this version of classic get...
---
Nah I'm just a drop-in no-Simpsons-knowledge-havin pedant
---
The Warcraft logs statistics show damage rankings based on what percentile the parses are in. Go look at any boss, specifically the single target ones, and select any percentile and you'll see that spriests are around middle to bottom of the pack, just like the graphs linked above show.
---
Spreist spellpower coefficients are good, their DPS is decent and they provide good utility to the raid but from what I hear mana is an issue. This won't manifest itself in a raid until later phases though, at that point any guild going for optimal setups will only take one spriest max for shadow weaving.
---
You guys are beasts in PvP though, and still much better than boomkins/ret pally so I wouldn't worry too much about community perception of your spec lol. The same people saying spriests are bad talk shit about warlocks too, shows how clueless they really are.
---
Yeah, you can't eat while in combat. First Aid has saved me so many times already, and I am only level 20. Frost Nova mobs you pulled to much, bandage. Sheep mob, bandage.
---
I am saving my cloth for tailoring later too but I still have more then enough for first aid. (For now atleast)
---
True dat :/
---
Lol the guy who only had a rhetorical question as fact, is now angry because he is "not given the facts" you're a walking fallacy my friend
---
Now we're on the stage "DRUIDS ARE WAY BETRER TANKS THAN WARRIORS IN RAIDS" (from druids are okish in 5 man") that's a serious overcompensation... Dude you're not born with your class, if you recall love tanking, roll the tank class
---
The main point of tanking is sustain... The hole in druid tanking logic is that druids are dmg sponges... They need to be kept alive by healers with very limited mana... Fight gets too long cause not enough dps... The heals are oom
---
Want Facts? Do you have any? 
---
Druids get crushing blows (more dmg received, a bad luck streak and you're dead) 
---
Druids get critically hit way more (no def rating) 
---
Druids DON'T block
---
Druids don't sunder armor (unless you plan on going cat while tanking)
---
Ddids have 1 talent tree for both dps and tank... Warrior have a full talent tree just for tanking (and more tank talens in both their other trees)
---
And the most overpowering fact of all... Experience... Go to join a hardcore raid and tell them you want to be the MT.. They will laugh in your face
---
You can two man tribute as rogue-druid or even rogue-rogue, so...
---
This is great for lookingforgroup. 
---
If you're a tank and you're happy to do any dungeon and you see a warlock looking for a tank = summon.
---
If you see a mage looking for a tank you know the group is empty and it's just him.
---
If you're a healer looking for 1 DPS and you get 5 whispers you can pick the water boy instead of the Ret.
---
I say great, but I suppose it's awful in a way too.
---
If I've learned anything from WoW is that Blizz was/is amazing at their poly count optimization. Some of the models are sheer genious.. it's the reason I keep my chicken pet out at all times.
---
It's getting worse and worse. Lately I'm even seeing runs that literally reserve anything that anyone would want to go to said dungeon for. Like BRD Anger/Arena with HoJ, Savage Glad chest, and caster boots reserved. Or Jed/Rend with the caster trinket and Dal'Rends reserved. Like why the fuck would anyone join that run?
---
You misinterpreted it. It was "classic is gonna have more players than retail" which was laughable from the start
---
My best advice would be: low level you just need charge into Def stance. You don't need. When you get zerker it becomes funnier. Currently my charge always change to zerker, and there I have shortcuts like Def+taunt. Also zerker +ww for aoe aggro is useful as fuck.
---
The Spectacled Bear is sometimes known as the Andean Bear because they live in the Andes Mountains.
---
I consume them by the stack every day as a priest, I just hate swimming
---
Yeah, you can pickpocket Plugger Spazzring for the Grim Guzzler key, though he'll notice having been pickpocketed when you unlock the door and that makes all the dwarves hostile, so make sure your party is at the door if you go that route.
---
It also makes you miss out on killing Panzer for whatever loot he drops.
---
This. Being competitive and able to complete Mythic raids in the top 500 guilds requires you do WQs, islands etc. I can't play retail without wanting to be competitive, but I can't do islands and WQs anymore. It's catch 22.
---
He lied
---
No it's because people post this shit every day, classic just came out obviously it's nowhere near dead.
---
The whole server of yojamba in one screenshot, heh
---
Retail just has too many elements that do not "fit into the world" and are just meta-settings (like difficulty modes, x-realm, 'only works up to level', facial-reconstruction at the barbershop, ... Stuff like that.
---
And it removed so many differences in the classes that they themselves become just different colored versions of the same role. 
---
From my wife: She loves the level-ups. That one talentpoint to distribute just rubs her the right way... (get your minds out of the gutter!). And also learning stuff from a trainer connects the character to the world.
---
All the queue's also turn the game-world in retail into a 'funny lobby' (beautifully done. Amazing designers!) while waiting for the menu to pop up. Not a world that contains and surrounds your characters. 
---
Also... way too much magic everything.
---
Nobody said that. Stop making shit up
---
Honestly the last 10 levels are the easiest. start running only dungeons at 55 for prebis, it goes so fast, maybe quest a bit in wpl/epl if youre tired of dungeons
---
Without the bitter things in the game, the sweet moments wouldn't be so good.
---
Alternatively that stupid jump through the ledge near the spiders/ogres ...
---
Do guild run or reserve.
---
Nah, that was back in vanilla and beyond. People have realised now that the meta is so against Rogues it is actually one of the least played classes in Classic. You'll see more warriors, mages, and warlocks for sure and Horde side at least there's definitely more shamans as well. Priests everywhere too, perhaps hunter and druid are the only classes that are in a similar spot as rogues.
---
[they did](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20769067878)
---
if you want to do dungeons the make strath living groups and reserve the first orb that drops.
---
otherwise you can still farm devilsaur leather or do other professions farming!
---
There are always methos how to get your gold ;-)
---
I find this issue with a lot of wowhead guides, nothing on survival hunters, though I came across one talking about tanking 5 mans
---
Well if thousands of games sound funner, you're clearly not made for the game. I'm having more fun than I've had in years in computer games.
---
wut? like every other mage?
---
Im playing a shaman and I use elvui, the class color is dark blue.
---
Yea i know, but its a bullshit line to say when he makes a long post on reddit that makes perfect sense to anyone that can read the english language
---
Because all halloween masks are out of proportions, but here it fits perfectly so it feels like real face.
---
Literally just zone in? Only raids, and maybe Dire Maul have a level requirement to zone. If you really really really wanted to, you could zone in to Mauradon at level 1.
---
imo healing feels pretty similar to DPS except you're spamming spells onto your friends instead and trying to get their HP to go up instead of down
---
Ssshhhhhh!
---
It is not bs. I have joined groups that said x item is reserved. If things are set before hand, I have no problem with it. The only bs I see in your comment is ninjas defending other ninjas ( e.g whine more ).
---
The line between a tank capable of gauging how much healing they will need to finish the next pack and the ones who are oblivious to details like that seems pretty fine, however - I've seen tanks of both camps. I like having a small security buffer in the form of extra mana in case of the latter, especially if someone manages to pull a patrol or extra pack. I'd rather not have to use a mana pot to make up for the mana difference there. 
---
If everything is done with control and the tank has a realistic picture of how to execute a pull with little healer mana, like you seem to, then it's all fine - but part of the reactions you're describing are probably due to the stress of not knowing whether you're actually that smart as a tank, or if you just think you can take it (or perhaps the healer is biting his nails and shouting "CAN'T HE SEE MY MANA?!"). At some point the healer will hopefully pick up on what you're doing and be OK with it.
---
I totally agree with you, and I usually leave too if the cause of the wipes is the same mistake of the same person. But I was commenting on the presumption that wiping at BRD is rare. It's not rare at all.
---
Plus we can post screenshots from 15 years ago with the same results.
---
Why is it always ZF?! It's always ZF i see these posts...
---
Oh yeah, because it's ZF lol
---
As already said, SM/Ruin is the best overall spec. DS/Ruin is only better once you have a lot of spellpower (around +300 just from items, not including buffs) and is a raiding only spec and even then, you must not be the only warlock in the raid otherwisr the tank loses the imp stamina buff. Go SM/Ruin and don't look back until BWL.
---
Apparently this got hotfixed maybe an hour ago. Both bosses share a threat table now as well as proximity aggro.

Puggle!

I'm an enchanter tank... When asked to tank an instance where I don't need anything I ask if I can need the BoE if nobody else needs... In that case it's a win win
---
It was always the case that melee hits of low level mobs hit you consistently but you resisted spells.
---
so i was reading....reading...starting to think of possible causes.  The first thing that came to mind was an old, video card.  Reading a little more.  I'm thinking to recommend to you, update drivers.
---
Then I get to the part where you say, 2013 Macbook
---
Whup!  That's the problem.  Macbook.  GET A PC!
---
There were three classes in my selection. Mage, warlock and druid.  
---
I decided to roll a druid because I have everytime something to smoke on my T1 shoulder set part. =)  
---
   
---
But fun aside, I think druids are very versatile and have a very good mobility. Especially for PvP I found the play style of the druid the most interesting. Druids are also not the most commun class which I like. They can fill all roles and are good supporters overall.
---
He means there's more ramp up for a shadow priest. We dot and build shadow weaving while mind blasting.
---
Mages literally press 1 button for maximum performance in many cases.
---
&gt; Do you know if their is any plan on allowing this kind of change for classic in the next phase? 
---
No !
---
just reroll, or ignore helmet in interface options
---
Was in BRD for over 3 hours for a "quick" Emperor lava run.
---
Had two healers who couldnt make it past the lava, one left other was kicked after he ressed at spirit helear.
---
The third and final Healer got us all the way to the Emperor with only 1 wipe.
---
But during the boss fight the Druid healer decided that he is top dps and blew all his mana on the princess bursting her with over 1k damage while the tank got only 1 sunder armor on her. The dps helaer didnt heal the tank once during the fight and died first. 
---
After this corpse run the trash had respawned and the "quick" run was finally over with zero emperor kills. The druid said that he is going to clear Ony after our run, hope he did his progamer-move there too and got kicked from his guild.
---
TLDR: Got to love DPS healers who dont understand threat.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/discord-servers
---
look down a little for the classsic ones
---
Seems like a nice little addon. Is there a way to save previous farm sessions so you can compare your current farming sessions to say one you did in another spot or on a previous day.
---
I remember the days when I used to play CS and other HL mods with bots, or even unreal tournament which had its OWN bots AND they even had chat messages (if I recall correctly). Now if I could make bots for WoW, I'd play offline permanently. I've never been 'socially adept', and I really do personally prefer my alone time (and even the game progressing at my own pace).
---
Did I understand it right that trash blade + mirah is pre raid bis until both dalrends?
---
Also is quel'serrar + mirahs better than dalrends? The dps on that thing is wild.
---
To be honest it'd probably be more people if blizz didn't have that PR nightmare recently. Literally the only reason why I stopped playing
---
&gt; Got to love DPS healers
---
*Overwatch PTSD intensifies*
---
 Strictly farming you’ll want to be Siphon Life with Demonic Sac but if you want to use your raid spec to farm then SM Ruin will be more than enough to do the job
---
Grinding dungeons is something that just kills your soul it is so painfully boring, I don't know how you can possibly enjoy it.
---
Report them. Should be simple fix for GM?
---
I speedleveled a mage and I was so mad and frustrated all the time when things didn't go my way. I began once more with an undead rogue and i'm taking my time reading quests... so much more fun. Never again am I rushing this game.
---
talking on voice or typing in chat? im also german and id say my english is bad, but i only think about talking. i just dont have any experience with talking and thinking on the fly. i can type just fine, thats enough time to think about words, but if i want to talk im not quiet fast enough and have wierd pronaunciation, because i never said that word out loud
---
 In many situations we are not
---
I'm out right now but, i'll check in a hour when i'm how. I can vagely remember that i had something for it.
---
Pretty sure there is a lowest level required, though. I seem to recall 40, but too lazy to google.
---
A year old thread using hyperbole and only 2 pages of discussion.  Cool.
---
What are you trying to prove here? Your dps is still nothing compared to the top performing speccs.
---
I was thinking bout the same, but not quitting entirely. Maybe taking a break til that bs is over.
---
If my Krol Blade drops and people roll need to sell it imma kill some people
---
Hmm, I think blizzard has already picked and chosen QOL features, you have new settings menus, an in game clock, gear from patch 1.12 in patch 1.0.2 content, talents from 1.12, pvp gear will be end game pvp gear not original stuff.
---
My point is the game IS NOT #nochanges in it's current format, the rabbit hole argument is complete garbage for not introducing positive changes and patching is a negative thing for the game.
---
Los functions poorly, interrupts function poorly, totems function awfully. 
---
This is all because batching is on a near 1 second tick timer. I'm not asking for a broad sweeping QOL change but a reduction in the tick timer to keep some of the quirks that it brings, but remove some of the more egregious shit that's happening.
---
If it's free to play (or buy to play), it's possible it has stuff you can pay for. Dungeons and dragons online and DC universe online are both free to play but have stuff you can pay real cash for. Path of exile is also free (not an MMO) but has stuff you can put money down for. There's lots of ways to make cash off free or buy to play games.
---
Its weird, on Gehennas H there is probably 20 times more semi-harcore PvE guilds than there was on any private server, Nostalrius for example had at the very max 10 per faction. Its weird since Nost had an active population that was much bigger than the current server cap but still I managed to speak to 20 guilds, most of them running atleast 2 raid teams, and most of them were way too full to take anyone in.
---
If they dont cast you could use a limited invulnerability pot to just walk in loot and die
---
Is there any margin to be made in buying mats off of AH and turning them into mooncloth bags?
---
Are you sure? Yeah, im just gonna enter and get stuff from master loot, that's the plan.
---
TB =&gt; Stonetalon and Desolace? That guy must have used a crooked map or wanted to fool you.
---
Anyway glad you got where you wanted to go, however for the future I suggest you find a small and nice guild and ask in your guild for assistance or, the modern version, google if allgoes south.
---
To thank the dude, just sent him a nice mail!
---
I'm a rogue and coincidentally leveled up my lockpicking last night from 200-250 with chests in searing gorge. It didn't even take an hour and I was able to grind some XP along the way (not 60 yet). Skilling lockpicking is not as bad as people make it out to be, especially if you do it while leveling.
---
That said, for me it's always just been a utility that I bring for the group (like mage water or warlock portals) and never even considered to take a locked chest just for myself...
---
Thazz'ril the Dreadlord - sounds about right
---
Same here I migrated servers and I'm still getting bnet whispers for ubrs... I'm not even specced tank lol
---
This reminds me of the time a lowbies asked if the Zepplin taking flying to UC, took him to UC. I said "nope" and before I could type "jk" he immediately just yeeted off the side into the ocean, just missing the loading screen..
---
I won't lie I felt kinda bad but fuck it was hilarious. I whispered him and actually ended up SAVING him time, I don't remember the exact details but what he needed wasn't in UC.
---
Me too
---
/dnd ? Never heard of this command. Looks useful.
---
drunk pvp
---
And i still dont know which one to choose in classic
---
As others said, it used to be meant as a way of a majority of guild members just filling up the last few slots.
---
What it seems to mean in Classic is that 8/40 are from the guild and they're using it to try and seem like an organised group and as a glorified means to ninja consumables/reagents/the good loot. I steer well clear of any "hosting" runs that aren't at least 75% guild.
---
Had a queue of 2 hours on sunday
---
As of right now private servers are more true to vanilla than blizzard's server.  Also, classes havent been modified on private servers and there's a shit ton less bugs.
---
Good playlist or good audiobook. 
---
Turn off your XP bar, grab a beer or milkshake or something and just kill and chill.
---
Phase 2 is live for 7 days now...
---
Dwarves are basically Horde players who for some reason want/need to be on Alliance. I basically just treat Dwarves like Horde brothers and (rarely) sisters.
---
Gnomes, however, are the scourge. Why anyone would willingly play something that looks and talks like that... There HAS to be something wrong with you. Kill on sight.
---
PS I'm an Orc Rogue and if you're not a Gnome I am pretty friendly. Rogue as a class attracts a lot of edgelords but we have the benefit of not being meta and not necessarily the best at anything at all, so you don't get your try-hards and powergamers.
---
Use [glosbe](https://glosbe.com). It covers all the languages of the European Union (translate from and to the language) and is much more reliable as it's a database covering legal documents from the EU.
---
Serpent sting is fine for Gordok, I use it every time and have it up as a dot after I fd+sit down and drink, never ever pulled aggro due to it. 
---
The pull right before you use seaforium is pretty easy if you just let your pet pull both packs and rub back to the bottom of the ramp. You can go and use seaf while your pet goes out of range=no damage taken.
---
Warlock = you have to compete with 100 million mages for SP gear that isn't warlock specific. Also - your pet is a freaking moron
---
The world is not black or white.

\*UPDATE\* I have made many of these macros a lot shorter/neater and updated the list accordingly.

Do Not Disturb

I’m ashamed to admit I helped a rogue not die in Un’Goro doing the Linkin Quest to kill the fire guy.  He was dying fast, I taunted aggro and ran off to die.  He lived.  If my faction knew...
---
English is English. There's no such thing as 'US English'. Armour has a 'u' ,the letter 'z' is pronounced 'zed' and a tortoise and a turtle are separate distinct creatures.

Rogue: your only unique benefit is picking the door to DiM Trib.
---
Yeah Ive been looking at alot of videos of 60's in lowbie dungoens from 13-14 years ago. You know what there isnt aswell? Leeway. You could legit dance around the mob 5 feet from them 0 hits.
---
no its not, scepter from princess/emp (idk who drops it) and oh from cho rush is better
---
At least you know it exists. I'm on about 80 runs now and I've never even seen it.
---
I'm beginning to think you're all winding me up and it actually drops off redridge boars.
---
Hunter = leveling 1-60 is your endgame as you become dogshit in every area at level 60
---
I am leveling my first ever mage and I am not ashamed to admit it is only because I want a farming horse. I am trying to 100% make this mage for AoE farming. What is a good skill tree to work off of or a suggested build?
---
This is my guess (with no experience at all): https://classicdb.ch/?talent#obhVsocZZbAGc0ctVo
---
Try getting more sleep m8
---
You are basing this on a 24 hits sample? Way too small sample number for being even remotely reliable. 
---
I got Windfury to proc 3 out of 4 hits, does it now have 75% proc rate across the board?
---
Is this common for spellcleaves?  I avoided them on my way to 60...seems like a good way to get people irritable, tired and bored.
---
Your main raid sells the bag??
---
Just relax and try to not get mad at stuff for a while. Its not worth it anyways.
---
Must be the tank...he’s there for a job
---
Bullshit. At some point only pre bis is an upgrade.
---
You know if they didnt state it was reserved beforehand, and stated that it was rolls ms&gt;os, you can make a ticket and they will both transfer the weapon to the highest roller ”you” and also suspend the people who ninjad it?
---
I'm trying to google it but it only gives recommended lvl to run it.
---
Actually got one of my prebis just by asking nicely. Mentioned I needed Blackmist Armguards at the start of an ubrs run, got along well with the raid in voice chat, and when they dropped asked if I could get them. Had 3 dps all pass on them for me since it was all I needed. 
---
Being a generally reasonable and nice person works out more often than being a asshole
---
I had the exact same thing happen to me. Luckily I've been scammed that many times I knew something was fishy... I was trying to sell an [Axe of the Deep Woods](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=811/axe-of-the-deep-woods)
---
When all of a sudden I got a whisper saying someone was willing to pay for it. I knew for sure it was bad for Warriors especially at 50 or so. So I simply asked him if this was his alt.. He said yeah this was my alt and that he did have a main character.
---
He also mentioned to do this exact method to "C.O.D" it to him.
---
I was going to but I stopped myself, and no I didn't hesitate knowing what his initial plan was probably to do. I stopped myself for one reason and that was because I didn't want to mess up the C.O.D mail and somehow ruin the gold value or another one I thought he was going to abuse some bug that he could get the item somehow without paying the gold.
---
LUCKILY this wasn't the case as I said before I've been scammed many times as I'm sure most people have as well, at least once or twice. I simply stopped myself and asked him.. 
---
"You're in Orgrimmar, right?"
---
"Let me come to you and then you can trade me it as I just want the gold to be instant and quick so I can go get my Dreadsteed"
---
 
---
In which he replied the following...
---
"I don't have the gold right now as I'm waiting for my items to sell"
---
"Maybe I can get someone to lend me gold"
---
Anyways, to cut this story short a bit I basically told him after like 1 hour of trying to sell this BoE Axe,  "Hey, do you have the Gold" he logged off.. He came back online and I repeated the question, he then replied "Sorry I couldn't find anybody to give me a loan for 325g, if you are still selling after my stuff has sold, I'll whisper you" (something along these lines).
---
So I either made him think the following
---
* Either he knew his plan was over as I was keen to sell it and found multiple offers
---
* He knew I was onto him
---
OR... The guy was a genuine guy willing to purchase but seeing this Post makes me believe something fishy was going on.
---
Ask her if there's anything she's passionate about and have emotional investment in, and then ask if she doesn't get pissy when shit didn't turn out as she expected. Unless she's literally Spock there's got to be something she cares about that can get her worked up, Paradise Hotel perhaps..
---
I don't think so. I think that if you're a hunter using some weird survival build that prioritises crit over everything else for whatever reason - then your BIS shoulders would be the ones from UBRS combined with a respec. Your BIS items for some weird build you've created because you want to play differently means that you don't take playing seriously enough to need a BIS item in my opinion.
---
And I think it's pretty egregious so call Meta builds "bullshit". If you don't want to play the BIS spec then fine, but don't expect everyone to start agreeing that your mage needs a mp5 ring because you're role-playing a mana-staved withered.
---
Roll for the item linked. No other loot rules were stated.

Don't know about mooncloth but I know you can for linen bags make an easy profit (slow but very easy). Wool not a chance, and silk not a chance. But if you also enchant you can make a steady income off greater magic wands.
---
And that is based only on vendor. If you want to make the gamble I'm sure there is more profit in AH if your server has a good price for those items.
---
Mage = drinking simulator
---
Druid = can do everything, but not as well
---
Warrior = VERY gear-dependant
---
Priest = feels slow, but doesn't mean is slow
---
Shaman = drinking simulator
---
If you farm the mats on your own it's all profit. They just want a quick sale and get it out of their inventory
---
Got a toddler so that’s where most of my sleep goes
---
Ah, I haven't noticed that mooncloth has a CD to craft, that explains a few things about prices of felcloth relative to mooncloth bags.
---
How do you refrain from going OOM with green shadow wrath gear? They say prioritize spell power over other stats but don’t you have to have enough intel spirit not to go oom?
---
Hit cap =9 
---
Crit highest as possible
---
Can I try to do one thing properly? Hotw/NS does nothing, I can understand argument at the moment as you need to respec each time, but this build does not let you perform any of 3 things you do in pve to max.
---
I initially defended reserve runs because they were the exception, but they're quickly becoming the rule. As more and more players hit 60 and raid spots are becoming more competitive (i.e. PUG runs for MC are starting to check gear for most non-healers/warlocks), reserved runs are really getting out of hand and it's "norm" spiralled from a single item being reserved to multiple items.
---
What's worse is that it's now bred the attitude where people will not join a run you organise if *they* can't reserve an item, so it's even becoming difficult to "make your own with no reserved items if you don't like it".
---
6% with bows if Troll
---
I'd wager that at least 80% of players are at 1920x1080, which puts them at the same aspect ratio and resolution. Anyone else with a 16:9 aspect ratio would just have to resize things. That would cover the vast majority of people.
---
Pretty fly for a dead guy
---
Dont listen to this. Its just proof that gnomes are good at the game. All the people who focus pvp go for gnomes/dwarfes, thats why we are hated. They are getting owned by us on the battlefield.
---
The major problem people don't understand. When you do stuff like this you and your guild gain a reputation and then eventually everyone is gonna know not to fill your PuGs. Hell I was running BRD earlier this week and had Savage Glad on res, and it was like 4am and no one was on so it was just the healer and me in the group for awhile. Eventually a paladin whispered me "Well if you're reserving that I want the first HoJ if it drops." I still needed HoJ mind you and I figured waiting another x amount of time was not worth it over getting the arena/anger/golem farm started and they were also bringing 2 mages with them. So first run, no glad chain. I accidentally left masterlooter on for Anger, HoJ drops. I could have easily ninja'd it to myself and screwed this paladin over. Not even a hesitation, ML'd to the Paladin. She went on to tell me that she actually thought I was going to ninja it, we laughed about it I made some jokes about me thinking about it, we moved on, ran 4-5 more times. No Savage, no HoJ. Well I got word from them that  they are looking to switch guilds just from stuff going on in their guild and they are heavily considering my guild because I keep my word lol. Reputation is everything in Classic, reputation was everything in Vanilla. (I got my HoJ in a guild run today so everything is great lol) sorry for the long ass response.
---
Or fuck off with defending deplorable behavior just so you can AHCKSHUALLY someone on reddit.
---
Wait, what? What are you even talking about? Ofc being a master looter means that you can do what ever you want with the loot, does that mean you f ppl up after calling for a roll? Why call for a roll then, how much more specific does it need to get?
---
Yes!
---
Make an impact!
---
I actually never see any big reserves anymore. Occasionally a recipe or single specific item, and orbs frequently but the hardcore reserve stuff died on my server when those people couldn't get a group, and many were put on ignore/player note lists
---
Could be summoning alts, most hardcore players have atleast one level 20 lock, for the super tryhard guilds atleast 1 summoning alt is required for world bosses.
---
Unless you are good.
---
And there it is.
---
Pretty insane evening. 3 raid groups defending IF pushing the horde out to the lake while a counter group went to UC. Counter group failed  :p But we managed to defend IF! #ForTheAlliance
---
Hey, have you ever ran into a human mage called Thalyssra? I've met a few tauren warriors while leveling, and if they're low I always polymorph them to heal them quickly and save their food.
---
Helps against being ganked! :)
---
To be fair, your name is "darkstalker", this probably didn't play in your favor...
---
or maybe it's that 10% spell hit talents are pretty strong when there is only 2% spell hit from gear currently available.
---
Backstab does more damage than melee on meters.
---
No he can’t, loot rules don’t have to be that specific. If he says MS &gt; OS and that’s that, a rogue should win vis kag if he’s swords and has the highest roll, simple as that.
---
You can’t just ninja an item cause you lose and then say “oh actually loot rules were the LOWEST roll wins, sorry we never told you”. 
---
Get the fuck out of here with that bullshit
---
whats that addon on top left that tells you when more instance will be available?
---
Oddly enough, back when it was first released, a lot of people complained that the time investment was blizzard being greedy.  As was the forced social reliance.
---
People figured: Blizzard made everything take so long because the longer it took to accomplish things, the longer they could milk subscriptions.   They also figured that people would convince their friends to play, garnering more subscribers, because you relied in people in order to make the aforementioned time investment worth it.
---
Basically, people will always accuse companies of trying to earn money.  Because they are.
---
Blizzard replaced falling subscriber counts with systems that allowed for solo play, and made up for the fall in subs with other ways to monetize.  Nothing has changed, Blizzard is still trying to make money.  The only thing that has changed are gamers themselves.
---
I mean, what is more greedy than releasing a 15 year old game basically unchanged?  Trick question: it's not greed.  It's a company who saw a huge untapped market of their own game in pservers and figured the reinvestment into it would pay off.
---
It has.  For both blizzard, and us.
---
Only retards said that
---
Is this on Razorgore-EU?
---
Report them and make a ticket
---
We figured it out like two weeks ago.
---
* Threat from P1 remains.
---
* In P2, Onyxia shoots fireballs at the highest threat target.
---
* If the target stands alone, the target will lose alot of threat.
---
* If the target has someone else on him which soaks the splash, the target will NOT lose threat.
---
* When entering P3 Onyxia will just aggro the highest threat target (duh).
---
The problem comes if the main tank/tanks gets hit by fireballs when standing alone, therefore reducing their threat massively and making it extremely difficult to catch up.
---
In the case you have a player standing on the main tank, you will quickly start noticing a pattern. Onyxia will keep shooting fireballs on the main tank until a ranged dps overaggro him. Onyxia will then shoot a single fireball on the dps (if they stand alone) and then go back to shooting at the tank. Just make sure that no mage/warlock overaggroes in the last few seconds of P2 and Onyxia will always go back to the tank.
---
The player soaking with the tank is going to require alot of healing, so it helps if somebody grabs as much fire resist gear as possible to help with mitigation.
---
Hope this helps!
---
Exactly
---
Paladin: Auto-attack + SoC procc, this is your rotation
---
Yep, me too. I quested to 60 and have a single target build.
---
I see what you think you did there, but you didn't
---
My thoughts from playing holy/disc priest around 2004/2005. And to be clear there are great things about the class and spec but the requested info here is the negatives. 
---
Pvp as a priest will be super frustrating unless you have dedicated bodyguards like a warrior to hamstring things for you or a rogue to stunlock your attackers. If you're caught on your own you're screwed, rogues especially will eat you for breakfast. 
---
Where it hits you the hardest is when you're doing stuff like alterac valley or AB and you're in the back line healing like a maniac, taking care of everyone, making sure everyone is topped off, but when the rogue jumps you nobody comes to your aid, they just keep fighting and leave you to die, it's a bit of a slap in the face. 
---
So next time you're in a big pvp fight and you feel those sweet heals coming in please keep an eye on your healer, because they can't heal you when they are dead.
---
Remindme! 12 hours
---
fuck 😂😂
---
I didn't know that, will try to make a ticket and explain the situation, but I doubt anything will come of it, since Blizz clearly stated they don't get involved in such cases.  - " Ninja looting does have consequences in the community and those who do it will have trouble getting invited to group. In other words: your reputation will matter. Remember to play nice, play fair folks! "
---
Y’all(horde) seem to definitely have the numbers, like some kind of menace I tell ya’what. I thought Sunday was gonna be my night to grind after the weekend rush.
---
Nope.
---
Fucking horde everywhere.
---
Cheers though, love you all even though in game I  hope you all die.
---
Blacksmith keys
---
You need to practice your googling skills if that is the case. What search terms are you using??
---
Some mixed numbers pop up, but going through them the most hits claim it to be 30, with two others giving the numbers 25 and 35 respectively, so level 30 sounds like a pretty good estimate.
---
TrinketMenu
---
&gt; i wish they had put the key ring in with Dire Maul
---
Agreed 100%.
---
If I'm tanking I'm puling what I see fit.
---
Sometimes I will skip a certain pack on one run but pull it on another. Jed's room in UBRS is a prime example of this.
---
If I have noticed people cannot hug a wall properly to avoid being knocked back or ass pull, I will pull an extra pack.
---
If someone doesn't like it....fuck them.
---
well, if they are impatient enough to sell it for vendor price, they should sell it to a vendor instead of selling it on AH. it will be much faster, no?
---
I don't believe you. I think this claim is rooted in pure jealously of the natural and obvious advantages that the class has during the leveling process on this undertuned patch.
---
If the timer is active, it will not pause the session, only reset, in case someone is in the middle of a session and just wants to clear it.
---
&gt; Hunter = there's still stigma against the class from the huntard era 
---
Thankfully mages have taken it upon themselves to be the new huntards
---
Because warlock is the most fun and diverse (pure dps) class in the game. You can go dot spec, insane critz spec, immortal pet spec and some hybrids. Its so much fun and you arent forced to play just one spec like certaino other spellcasters (mages im looking at you)
---
No kidding, I just finished up Run #81 through Arena, Angerforge, and Golem Lord. 
---
No chest, no trinket, no ring still.
---
I asked him about it and he said well he won the roll and we don't want to be known as ninjas so it goes to him.
---
Hunter - you’re great! But this state you’re in, is all you’ll ever be
---
At the end he mentioned that the hardest part is to chat in english in game, 'in real time'  
---
That is an essential part of his story because it's about not being the most social person (plus language barrier) , yet experiencing this great positive feedback from the community.  On reddit he can think longer so it's easier to write there. 
---
It's very recognizable for me.  I am in the same situation.
---
Just to confirm: 305 wep skill means you only need 6% hit from gear? Or do you need 7%?
---
I remember early on when everyone was skilling up their enchanting, the margin on magic wands was so low that I would just vendor them. Still, I wonder if there could be some interesting way to profit from dis/enchanting that isn't already heavily exploited yet.
---
Classic was a game made for gamers by gamers.
---
This era we life in for gaming is a dark age. Everything needs to be monetized and maximum profit. 
---
No sense of accomplisments or progressions. Its all RNG. I'm so hooked to classic again. Not the nostalgia but the gameplay and systems are so tight together.
---
Ohw need to farm some elemental GO INTO THE WORLD!. need fire res  potions for ragnaros better find a alchemist who can make them for me with some nice discount!
---
Ohw that nice enchanter I encounter will go there gain.
---
This is just a world that feels alive. No instances. No portals no instant gratification. Work. Every project is always about the work you put in and when your done you feel fulfilled. Thats how games should be made. Atleast MMO's no stupid transactions or pay for a mount. Why would i ever obtain something then if it doestnt feel special.
---
They still couldnt take first even with all their dots, you can go and try of course, I've even regularly seen siphon lifes up on bosses in pugs, some dont even know its a dps loss to waste a gcd on that.
---
Spriests use 3 debuff slots, but shadowweaving benefits all shadow-dmg casters and thus is always one of the top debuff priorities anyway. And swp is the best dot in the game, better than all the wl dots, So swp should have higher priority than any other dots as well. Spriests only use 1 unoptimal debuff slot for themselves to deal very respectable damage.
---
Yes, and it will extend to raids.
---
The issue is that only items from the pre-bis pool is an upgrade. Sure, I could go for the sword from Baron, but that’s practically banned in raids because of the debuff
---
Yea I've had a similar experience with people saying I'm doing good dps. I dont have a meter or anything (not using addons until I hit 60) so it was cool to hear from people that I was actually doing my job pretty well.
---
9% hit unless u get a bow and then you only need 6%. Ancient bone bow is the best pre-raid bow you can get and I believe it drops in scholo
---
Mankrik had just won the Azeroth Jackpot and his wife had discovered that he had an affair with an ogre
---
There are no enrage timers so as long as you can deal with whelps and healer is geared enough to never run out of mana, you can get away with 3 players, jt just takes forever. I don't think it's possible to for healers in current gear though, but it's not that far off and T2 for priests would help a lot.
---
Wait, so Masterloot works from anywhere in the instance?
---
Say, in Mara, if I kill the Princess I can Masterloot the ring to someone that is just inside the entrance?
---
Not sure if trolling but p2 hasn’t been released yet.
---
please report them like it has already been suggested a lot and let us know about the result of your report
---
I can run SFK, certain parts of SM (mostly Cath), ZF, BRD and Strat live pretty endlessly. Those are just fun dungeons to me 
---
Alternatively I'm running WC, BFD, and Mara exactly 1 time for the quests and never going back. I'd never run LBRS again if it wasnt a very important endgame dungeon
---
Such childish responses only further serve to show that you have been spouting baseless claims all along, while accusing people of doing exactly what you are doing (not knowing what you are talking about).
---
Try doing UBRS jed/rend runs with only 6-7 people as tank, so you only have to roll against 1 or 2 people.
---
There are plenty of items that are not in those two dungeons. Get the hit bow from dm east/lbrs, do strat ud for the head/cape etc.  just focus on that for a while.
---
Farm mats for the Lionheart Helm. 
---
...and don't stress over the most optimal items, just try to get your hit rating to 6 or 9% and you are good to go.
---
If you plan to raid in the near future it's not a bad idea to go combat(swords or daggers, either is fine) anyway, but I have seen people do it in sub spec and add lograine into their run with improved sap for one of the adds and such. Plugger is really quite easy though so it shouldn't matter all too much what your spec is since 90% of having it go cleanly is lining immolate and shadow bolt and popping evasion when he gets melee happy.
---
just people letting addons play the game for them.
---
ENGLISH MACHINE BROKE
---
Don't go 2H without hit cap. So if you only got 6% hit, stick to axes in raid. If you can't get a 2H axe, get 9% hit.
---
Mate...it was a free roll, I was not the only pug. Stop defending this type of behavior please, it makes ppl like them think what they do is good. Everyone who was a pug in that run was stunned that they ignored my roll. When it was time for Ony Head they stated who was allowed to roll on it ( eg, no pugs ). It's not rocket science.
---
Take everything in moderation, even world of warcraft. obviously not following the tips.
---
How is the crit cap related to glancing blows? What’s the (estimated) formula for crit cap?
---
that's just how it was, if you can't handle it you're playing the wrong game
---
Report them. Even if this is not bannable (it might be), they'll have their accounts flagged from now on. The GMs should either delete the item or transfer it to you, as well. 
---
This is not OK behavior from their side, and you have screenshots to back your claims up. GMs can get access to chat logs if they think you have a case, which you definitely should have here.
---
I've done 5 MC runs now and doing 5th onyxia today. I only have belt of might and the non tier tank boots with fire res, (Can't remember name) as well as eskanders collar from ony.
---
From what i've found with partners like this, is that if they dont like a certain aspect of your life (gaming,Working out or w/e) they will blame everything on that specifik thing. The only thing you can do is to talk to your partner and explain that gaming is a part of who you are and she doesn't have to love it, but atleast accept it. And she cant blame everything on the game. If she cant accept that maybe some time apart will do good.. Best of luck!
---
Is this yawn? Dude funny
---
Got no problem with reservations if the group is a tank+healer only in need of DPS. Tanks and healers are the more desired roles; if they want to put things on reserve, more power to them. It's the price of having the group basically pre-made for you.
---
Tbh in my opinion only the first few weeks felt amazing. Everyone was quested with everyone, everyone helped each other and there was a lot of funny conversations in /1. I recently started a new character who is lv 35 now but it feels like all the magic is gone. Everyone minds his own shit again, no funny interactions with random players although there still are lots of players on my level. It feels a bit more like rush everything asap, not enjoying the game anymore. Idk is it just me?
---
This should be the norm, however there will be people in game and on reddit that like to argue, ninjaing stuff is ok if only the value is high enough.
---
What's it like knowing you are wrong but doubling down no matter what?
---
Maybe I do... Yeah I find that information for private servers.
---
It's not anywhere in the instance, but the range is pretty substantial. I.e. you can master loot gear off of princess in Mara if they're at the end of the cave with the hydras right after the waterfall
---
Oh, the audacity! How dare you!
---
i think he thinks DM = P2
---
People always want bags so yes there is a margin, but not at all times of day, and not a ridiculous margin either 
---
But it does depend on the sever
---
You run an instance 67 times for 1 item? I'm not gonna tell you how to spend your time, because it's your life, but it seems like a waste when you consider that when TBC lands the quest reward greens will replace the items you spent 100s of hours farming.
---
Aaaw its super cute that you think DM was phase 2.
---
She might have right at times, and she might use it as an excuse during arguments.   
---
I personally get frustrated a lot in some aspects of wow, because you're so invested in it. It's natural. In every activity you might get "hot-headed". Nothing new under the sun there. What you can however do is to find some weekly routines to went your frustration on. Like if you noticed you are a bit short tempered after raids because you dont get the items you want etc, make sure you always have GYM day on those days. 1 Hours with intense workout before every raid. Just an example :)
---
I go out of my way to gank players questing as tanks or healers.
---
You think leveling prot/holy was a good idea?
---
Okay, buddy.
---
I hate us too, I'd be alliance on a PVE realm if I had my way!
---
I enjoy the game, that’s why I’m playing it. I’m asking for advice
---
Yeah, whenever we have downed her it's on the tries where off tanks and fury warriors just fight for threat at 45% and ranged dps stop. We've tried this flameball splitting "mechanic" but it seems to just wipe both of our threat, even if we run multiple (3,4) tanks in there with high threat, everyone is wiped to 0 when she comes down.
---
Best strat so far for us was when we had a very long phase 2 and MT was able to get threat back with recklessness after maybe 3 ranged dps died in phase 3, or when paladin OT just slammed her with seals the entirety of phase 2 and picked her up after just a couple dps sacrificed themselves in phase 3.
---
Id love to see a video of the double tank flame ball strat working. We'd love to find a more consistent strat cause usually it takes one or two wipes and then we down with no problem once we get used to the chaotic threat switching.
---
Time apart is a no go, we recently got engaged and we have a kid together. I feel like it’s because she doesn’t like it but I’m not to sure if it’s me or not..
---
Mage: Lvl1-15ish may cause depression. Consult your doctor before starting.
---
I generally prefer if that time and effort is pent doing something interesting like overly complex quest chains rather than mindless grind, but yeah, at least it's better than just blatantly buying it.
---
To be fair I didn't even see your roll either to begin with. I was like "but the highest roll did get it" and then I saw your 100. I think it's because it's slightly off from the "row or other rolls". That part I think was an honest mistake, however not trading it to you afterwards kinda tells another story and that's indeed shitty behaviour.
---
Warrior: People keep whispering you to offer you money to tank stuff and chucklefucks on reddit that shouldn't have rolled the millionth mage complain about warriors reserving items.
---
Math checks out. Make it official. 
---
*dusts off nerf bat*
---
Isn't it a 5% drop rate?
---
Sounds like a good example. Maybe I should look into something like this
---
Warrior main - Groups looking for dps and tank to fill up, you ask to join as DPS warrior. Sure they say. As the dungeon is about to start they ask if you got a shield for the worst pulls, you think to yourself, i mentioned i was dpsing yeh? But sure, you got a shield you say. In the next 5 minutes you progress from beeing a dps with a shield, to beeing the tank. 
---
Yes you wanna play a dps warrior, but no, you're not going to be a dps warrior.
---
Not sure what you're trying to say, sorry.
---
He's not defending it, he's talking about what is punishable by blizzard and what isn't
---
how do you get everyone online if the queues are at least half an hour (not 24/7 but still)
---
I'm sorry, what?
---
Imagine bragging about parses in Vanilla
---
lol
---
Yes. Most likely they are too lazy to check the vendor price of the items and just have an AH addon that has a certain undercut threshold (be it fixed or %) and just slap all kinds of stuff up for AH. Even without taking the vendor prices into account. 
---
TLDR; cluelessness and addons.
---
No, I ran an instance for 3 items, not one. And we’re playing classic, not tbc. It’ll take a long while for tbc, if it even gets released
---
That's the reason to have a second language! If you can remember the word in the other language you can use it to help you translate into your native language. Ahhh, technology!
---
They specifically talked about phase 1 though. Aq is much later.
---
Will do when I get home from work :)
---
So with my 6% I shouldn’t raid? Or just dw?
---
Warrior: you need some of the most expensive BiS items from the AH and yet, you're the worst farm class. Also, you MUST use consumables bc you scale so much with them
---
Many people just don't pay attention. It's why you can sometimes list things for 100x their value and someone will blindly buy it without thinking.
---
Yea, just write `/fl w Newsessionname` to start a new session. I'll add a button for later later on.
---
Thanks for clearing that up
---
[Tell me about it, dude...](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d59pc3/thanks_dude)
---
Well you are a tank.
---
Yes, I would have believed the honest mistake part if it were not for the aftermath :/
---
Yee right you beat jokerd world record by like 3 days, sure
---
Either say "no warrior" or "leather/cloth dps" in the LFM message.
---
It's the halloween kandy. The ghost buff that you get from it also gives water walking.
---
I agree my dude, if you look up BiS lists and try to understand how they got to that point youll see the underlying methodology and be able to have a better grasp of your own class as well as viable alternatives to BiS that are often glossed over.
---
Ultimately this thread and many like it are really driving at the same point, which is something thats been debated endlessly over the past 2000 years of recorded history, and that is ethics and the behaviours we show to one another.
---
Greed and Avarice are deeply entrenched into ourselves and our societies and the level of corruption and inequality continues to rise, as well as our acceptance of it, and thats mainfesting itself within these simulations were playing.
---
I agree with the OP and the rise of general scumbaggery is worse on WoW than it was 15 years ago, but the fuck can you do? 
---
 Let it all burn to the fucking ground and then EVERYONE is equal.
---
Anyways, /rant off.
---
Oh nice! I'll have to remember that for next time.
---
&gt;And that's because vanilla isn't all that it was cracked up to be for some people.
---
Those people can go. Others who knew what it was and have been waiting for years are not disappointed.
---
Questing supported by AoE is better than AoE alone. The talent build is very bad for AoE. You can't have Frostbite while winters chill is only good for single target (as blizzard can't crit). Also you lack key talents like cold snap, increased range and slows. Shatter is questionable, esp when you don't have improved frostbolt (no you won't have AoE pulls 24/7). Something like this: [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#of0VZZiAMIRfzAo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#of0VZZiAMIRfzAo) with the option to move winters chill into shatter if you do more AoE, frost nova into cone of cold and you don't care about better raid compatibility.

---
The thing about Classic WoW is that lots of players are former Vanilla players, and hence older than your typical immature Nitefort or League of Legends troll.
---
And that's exactly why we don't clear packs around locked chest if the rogue doesn't offer to open it. Why would we waste time?
---
They get geated the fastest because no raid groups want that shit hunter dps so only like 2 are in the raid.  Farm gold the fastest is bullshit.
---
I did one for mage. Imo it's kinda balanced.

Let's at least wait until majority of player base get to 60.

I salute you
---
This, I rolled a shadow priest because I like pvp and I want to honor grind with that.
---
Was able to get around 75g/hr with it and since its a protected spot you have to slowfall to get into you didn't need to worry about ganks which made it nice.
---
But it doesn't feel as good.
---
Not a must depending on the mobs you farm, but incredibly handy nonetheless
---
Battleshout was bugged for a portion of vanilla and was used to cheese bosses like Nef and Twin Emps
---
I like how we need to have this "What happens when the content ends" argument two months in and before phase 2 is even close.
---
Classic is not meant to kill Retail, it's for people who prefer the original. No one entertains the idea of Classic being the next big one. Hype is irrelevant and unwelcome.

Who goes to west fall as a low level horde? Nah brah not worth

They‘re ok. You can get similar pants from a rare in GY, which makes them less appealing - otherwise they‘d be pretty great
---
Also if you see people spamming WTS silk 35s/mageweave 70s, they will just craft your cloth into bandages and vendor it for profit.

Just wait till Onyxia is 10-15% in p3

I think I just had a stroke
---
Thank you for the talents! I appreciate your quick response!!
---
What, this logic fails on so many lvls rofl
---
Yes, old servers that were considered healthy and booming usually had 2000-5000 concurrent players online.
---
U wot m8. There not better at english then us.
---
1. Warlock - you're basically a shittier mage but summon me, I cba flying/running. Reroll mage.
---
2. Alliance warlock - you're useless because of Will of the Forsaken. Reroll horde. Then see #1.
---
3. Rogue - you're an edgy 13 year old that can't fight fair.
---
4. Resto druid - you're an Innervate machine and battle-rez bot. Any other spec and you're just insane.
---
5. Boomkin - more like OOMkin, amirite? Better respec.
---
6. Feral - you couldn't decide between a warrior and a rogue so you thought "why not both". Better respec.
---
7. Holy paladin - you wear a dress and heal. Any other spec and you're just insane.
---
8. Retribution paladin - leave it for the real warriors. Just respec.
---
9. Protection paladin - leave it for the real warriors. Just delete your account.
---
10. Warrior - you expect to be fed with a silver spoon just because you take less damage than other classes.
---
11. Resto shaman - spam that chain heal boy. Keep dreaming about Frost Shock.
---
12. Enhancement shaman - irrelevant unless you get Hand of Sulfuras. Better respec.
---
13. Elemental shaman - you're basically a far, far shittier mage. Better respec.
---
14. Mage - just give me water and food, make me a portal then leave it for the big boys with swords and axes.
---
15. Hunter - one trick pony. Don't need on my gear.
---
Shaman: Enjoy the water totem quest at level 20 and being a healbot in raids. If you choose to dps as enhance you're a nightfall/totem twist bot at best, as elemental you're a slightly better oomkin stealing ger from resto shamans.
---
I just ignore all the people with "reserved" in their lfg\lfm message.
---
Works like a charm.
---
Then why are you sad seeing my post?
---
Is it because no matter how much you surround yourself with people. They don't seem all that interested in you unless you have something to offer them?
---
Your guild and "friends" how much do they really know about you? Honestly.
---
But the two samples taken are comparative, if they were represented as data sets you would see clear distinct extremities. I don't see the issue with this sample size.
---
On fights that melee sits out... And also, MC is only out.  The more content that comes, the harder hunters fall off and become even more dogshit than they currently are.  And 4 trib runs per hour is a lie.
---
Stick to whatever DW-axes you got, unless they are complete crap. :)
---
That sounds like fun.
---
Proto-brewmaster
---
dont tell him guys
---
For the pats before Bael’gar, it makes a lot of difference if the dps are making efforts for the tank to keep the aggro. Take a mage going full retard aoe and you could chain wipe whereas it would be really ok if it was doing mono instead. Sometimes a little thing can really make a huge difference.
---
To be fair, if a guild pugs Onyxia they should be able to reserve the mats and the head.
---
You can't.  I did that same path and got to the do south of kargath and thought I'll just Rez outside jargath.  Bam, back to the burning steppes
---
I have been doing SM Cath runs as a 60 rogue and I don't feel any difference in damage taken when compared by my (probably faulty) retail classic or pserver experience.
---
That is based on feels, will actually check dodges/etc later on, seems interesting.
---
I'm on 2 days played and I feel like I play a lot. This can't be healthy, physically or socially.
---
Just my opinion but I feel like they are one of the best designed classes not just in wow but across many mmo style games. And a very cool thing about them is they were a great class right off the bat in 2004 and stayed that way for many years. Some say that retail warlocks are a bit meh right now but I still thing the class is fun and exciting to play. 
---
Everyone has their preferences but there's something cool about DoTing up a bunch of mobs and watching all the hp bars tick away while you play the minigame of balancing your health and mana bars. 
---
Seriously I can talk for quite some time about how many cool abilities and talents they have.
---
Not angry.
---
I call it how I see it.

I see someone feeling lonely and depressed being in a really active guild
---
And I see you calling them stupid.
---
Thats a shit bag to me.
---
I didn't like playing shadow in classic. Of all the clothies I never felt like I brought much to a group that holy wouldn't offer and I was drinking after every pull. And not mage water, but the expensive gourmet stuff.
---
Had a guy leave after wiping on first boss in ZF, felt real good
---
To add to this, they mass reported my character last night and I have gotten a 24 hour mute for spreading this information.
---
There two screenshots btw, and the result would be ish the same if I went again and again.
---
Germany has too many pvp realms already. And a lot of ppl swapping lately after being tired of gankfests
---
from my experience tho, human rogues are the toughest in PvP. not having blind is one thing, never getting an opener is rough
---
I'm also playing horde on Bloodfang Eu. Name's movingfridge, feel free to hit me up !
---
I mean... I’m not going to reroll, I just got my mount at 40 Sunday hahaha
---
Isn't bloodfang one of the new realms that opened up recently?
---
How populated is the server compared to other big realms?
---
Those guys are amazing
---
Rofl that's such a dumb thing to say.
---
So... Are you going to burn through those pummelers while leveling or what? 🤔
---
&gt;all over the  comments section
---
Ah yes, my one other comment in this thread
---
I notice your pet run past you with a bunch of ogres on its tail. How do you get your pet to run to your initial position after having it pull a pack of mobs?
---
AOEing every group down in a dungeon is boring af too. I'm a mage and got in a group that did big pulls for me and it was nothing more than pull, blizzard, drink while they pull next group. I legit was falling asleep during that run.
---
At least with frostbolt spam you get to mix it up with a sheep or cs or something.
---
Was using steelseries wow cataclysm mouse up until a few days ago, my favorite mmo mouse... Just got steel series rival 500 mmo. I love it. Though, still getting used to the differences.
---
Way back in the day, my rogue was let in on a Kata run. Guild was finally trying out new members for raid teams. Blue dagger drops, total upgrade over my questing greens. Then the tank speaks up, "I don't know I might be able to use that..." I like my greens to the party to prove what a huge upgrade it is. Keep in mind the tank is in full raid gear, and I'm still pumping out 2nd in dps in questing greens. Ask the tank how many times he's use the dagger in raids or questing, and he admitted not much. 
---
They awarded it to the tank.
---
Corpsemaker from rfk is much better (lvl 29).
---
Yeah, no.
---
They mass report anyone that speaks out against them resulting in 24 hour mutes, too.
---
It's not the combat I have issues with, it's that I prefer dungeons with actual bosses and many varied units. The environments themselves are an exciting thing to watch (for instance RFD and RFK look ugly as heck, but SM Lib and SM Cath look fantastic, BFD is perhaps my favorite dungeon), and doing quests in the dungeon and having a tangible goal to aim for and COMPLETE is nice. Boss fights can have some fun mechanics that changes things around (though not as many boss fights do this as I would like), having to coordinate with the group to make sure everyone stays alive, etc.
---
I DO enjoy the combat of the class, but the combat isn't the reason I play. It's running dungeons and even gearing up that's nice. Grinding for crafting materials I'm 100% fine with because I'll be crafting stuff with it and hopefully replacing MY gear or someone else's (and when I hit 60 I'll be respeccing engineering, and engineering is MANY levels of fun!), grinding solely for XP gets dull.
---
I also plan on joining a guild to enjoy the camaraderie of playing with other people (something that for the longest time I DIDN'T enjoy), so the social aspect is also important.
---
Combat as a rogue IS fun, but I'm not playing this game for the combat, I'm playing for the fun dungeons, the camaraderie, the exciting boss battles and such. I also can't wait to go into engineering because you can make tons of fun stuff, and eventually I want to do some PvP in BG when it comes out.
---
Sitting there for hours just killing Ogre Brutes and Ogre magi and doing nothing different, seeing the exact same Ogre cave, and then heading out and killing more Ogre Brutes and Ogre magi, then going back in to the same Ogre cave and killing more Ogre Brutes and Ogre magi.....I mean I want a dungeon. I want to do quests that'll require me to kill *different* types of monsters, I want to do some fishing, I want to do some cooking, I want to take a flight path and go to a new area. There's LOTS of stuff I want to do.
---
You have to take into account realm transfers too. Not everyone left the game.
---
Sounds like you're just getting paired up with a lot of players with little to no situational awareness haha.
---
Do you not throw the tank a quick low heal or hoT before you drink?  I main tank and it's very common for the healer to heal before they drink since they are about to fill up.  I understand that that some tanks are clueless and impatient and since I've been at it for years I've got a habit of always checking your mana before/after every pull but isn't enough to throw a quick one before drink? I guess its mostly situational since 9/10 fights my HP is at least 80% and after those fights where everyone is nearly dead I could imagine only a newbie (to Classic) not thinking "I'll heal myself real quick and save the heals some mana". Grinding from 13-56 tanking dungeons I can tell Classic has it's fair share people who don't get the group mentality right away and play like what I assume retail is like, which I don't even think healers ever run out of mana in retail.
---
I think you misunderstood my post lol, I didn’t feel sad seeing this, I just thought it was sad for you to think that avoiding a hugely fulfilling part of the game was some kind of achievement. You might as well be playing a single player game lol.
---
The easiest money I’ve made on just buying mats and reselling on my server (Benediction Alli) is Arcane Crystals. They’re 35g on our server, I pay 5g for a transmute and sell the Arcanite Bar for 50g. 
---
10g a pop. During peak times I just call out for Xmutes @ 5g. Soon as anyone replies I buy the mats.
---
I think any Caperfin guide needs a big asterisk next to it, he's regularly shown that he doesn't understand various abilities or mechanics, to the point where his proposed strategies don't actually work because of his misunderstanding. That or his strategies are so gimmicky and impractical that nobody is ever likely to use them because they're so much work for virtually no pay off. A good example of both is his [smite DPS priest guide](https://youtu.be/P2PUcILxnnY?t=558), there are many thing wrongs with the point I've timestamped.
---
1. Why is he putting more than 1 point into Spirit Tap? If you're only after the buff then 1 point would suffice for fishing, it's the same spirit and regen at each rank.
---
2. Why do you have to enter a BG? Does he not understand that even level 60 players get the buff off mobs?
---
3. You can't summon directly into raids/dungeons, so at best you'd get summoned in front of said instance then get summoned again inside of. Ideally, you'd coordinate with an opposing faction member to die outside the raid, zone in and get summoned.
---
4. Given the case in point three you'd be lucky to get even 5 seconds of this buff in combat.
---
And this is just one portion of one guide. In this very same video he thought Desperate Prayer could be cast on others. In another video he believes Clearcasting and Flurry don't have a durations and proposes you could prep an entire raid of Mages and Warriors with their respective buffs using digrats. Again, so much effort for such a tiny little gain, one mana-free GCD and 3 faster auto attacks.
---
He gives me the impression that he doesn't actually play the game himself and just theorycrafts this crazy and/or unviable stuff all the time. Some of his guides are good but they're usually just a regurgitation of well-known strategies.
---
If you think I'm walking to any major city, you're insane. I need to save time dude.
---
Also, throwing fireballs and frostbolts in peoples faces are fun. Blink is the best skill in the game.
---
Perfect alt and farm char imo. Wouldn't want to main one, though.
---
Yo dude awesome!
---
Which guild are you in?
---
I play on Bloodfang as Horde too and had the same experience with a priest I did WC with which remembered me for Mara. 
---
Love that!
---
That's a pun, google for meaning.
---
Atleast you get runs! Im a rogue and dont get invited to anything.
---
It gives you a bit more time to finish the raid. Not an issue atm but will be later.
---
Good lad. Good tank. Good work.
---
I think the elitists need to stick with themselves and form their own private groups, stop inviting random people in LFG and expecting it to be their 500th run.
---
Well if you really want to keep killing ogres there's a few things things you can try to spice it up a bit. Have you tried the other specs or your class? What about fighting slightly lower level ones but pulling 2 or 3 at a time.
---
had a 5 (scale 1-6, 1 is the best grade) in english throughout my whole school. It got a little better since i use reddit tho. Now it happen to think that im a bit better then average. But that also diminishes because the younger generations are so good.
---
Ok, fingers crossed!
---
As a speaker of 4 languages this happens to me all the fucking time. I'll be looking for a specific word and know it in all languages except the one that I actually need.
---
In the case you are actually wondering who would join those: I've done a bunch of arena runs with big items on reserve; the trick is to have every person in the group want something out of it. Glad chain for tank, HoJ for mdps, trinket for healer, arena belt for caster dps and then you 4 man it. Every player gets a reserve on a big item, nobody is there to feed the rest loot.
---
People are just not interested doing 50+ runs for an item and then having to roll on it, the reserved runs are a response to that.
---
same, I don't see how I'll ever be able to consistently do a 50+ dungeon but I really enjoy questing and chill
---
yes
---
Ya I'm at 46 right now, and I only use my highest level heals on the tanks. I'll keep a mid-rank heal for the shammies and hunters, and then a lower heal for the squishies. I'd rather heal 70% of their health and keep the extra mana than spend more healing 130% of their health.
---
Had a holy/prot Pala with some healing hear trying to tank Scholomance yesterday. After the 7'th or so wipe he left after saying something like "get level 60 before you try to heal scholo". Most pulls was him dying within 15 seconds having used all the healers mana. We ended up doing the second half with 4 people no tank only wiping twice.
---
For those wolves, I just look for them every time I ride out for scholo, 5/8 will eventually get them all lol
---
Their are dozens of lazer chikens! I have yet to meet one but some day I will becime one!
---
Does anyone know of a Warlock Addon that lets me have just one popout type button for summoning all my pets? Like on retail how all the summons live in the same button.. on Classic I have them all on seperate key ones and it’s annoying.
---
the thing i missed the most from wow is seeing *thatguy* love how its back
---
/u/jcb088 think I found another admirer
---
How is the subject of interest to others? I'm curious. There's no resolution here, there's no "you can avoid this by", or "you can report this and gain" its just a bitch post about a guild that the vast majority of us will never have the misfortune of meeting. 
---
And in all honesty, your post comes dangerously close to breaking rule 3 of the subreddit, if not actually breaking it.
---
i have been lucky with the runs i have done, also i'm not torturing myself farming for absolutely every item that is a minor upgrade for me in there i just need kit to get me to 60 and to let me get into raids  i don't need the pre raid bis before i go into a raid, if i get it bonus if not oh well, i will mostly be looking to bring my weak areas up and go farm where those items drop but if everything is good enough then i'm happy to not see a full brd run again, would rather go UBRS/Strat/scholo for my kit than BRD
---
Why do you assume we will be forced onto TBC? We wanted Classic, I am fine with TBC but overwriting Classic and starting the downfall of the game all over again is not cool in my eyes.
---
You can, if you tank. Skarm tank just released a full MC fury prot MT pov video on his YT channel with a freshly dinged warrior. So it can work. But full prot or just fury dps is probably better rn. And a raid has to take you.
---
It is very much so. But the texture on the staff makes it look to have higher polygons.
---
Phase 2 is gonna be great for alliance lvl 60 pvpers looking for a fight. People to kill everywhere.
---
This is my plan!!!! Now getting a group to rfd might be an issue but.....at least my arms warrior can pose as a tank....
---
I guess they did a pve one because you can't transfer from pve to pvp
---
That way blizz can unite the RP people on one server
---
I had the same thing happen to me watching your DPS in MC the other night.
---
Well I did a lot of mona cim runs with 4 mages and me (priest) and the xp was clearly very fast.  
---
Why do you say it's a noob trap ?
---
Did they hit you for the same ammount at level 30 as they did at level 60 though? I can gather up 3-4 packs in SM Cath atm and I will struggle if I go for more.
---
Hey now, wow priests aren't canonically pedo's. That'd be the paladins
---
You sure don't want to go 2/2 imp. OP instead of 3/5 2h wep spec?  
---
25% increased crit chance on OP vs. 1% increase all dmg.    
---
Not sure which one is worth more as 2h fury...
---
The only people that are still making the there/their/they're mistake or spelling "definitely" wrong are native English speakers pretty much every single time
---
Why didnt you join a pve server then ?
---
Same thing happened to me back in Cata, Deathwing US server. Was top 3 warrior in dps, tank and pvp (before firelands patch and i went on hiatus). Had so much experience since my original server was Kiljaeden. My guild often got mad at me since i am the main tank and i use my weekly lockout for some random guilds who pay me in either gold or favors then i use my healer to roll with the guild raid lockout hahaha. 
---
Like a noob guild needs a main tank and a tactician leader to organize and carry them. I would pass on whatever the item and teach them. Many guilds fought for me and tried to recruit me. I stopped being kind ever since because strangers would vehemently spam contact me on ventrilo, mumble and facebook. I found a funny guild last 2014 and stuck with it ever since.
---
Mage: everyone expects you to carry dungeons with your aoe, and don't expect you to sit for mana.
---
I mean hes a rogue if his name was lightfollower itd probably look silly.
---
If you want AoE - you can spec into it. If you want single-target damage in raids - you can do that too, but your AoE will suffer. I\`d say it\`s good design.
---
/u/Ebambs your welcome
---
The plethora of people I have encountered in my years of WoW needing items they have obviously no other need than selling it for gold would disagree with you.
---
No
---
You buy those herbs so you don't have to waste your own time farming them.
---
I wish my guild wanted me to be the shadow weaver. Then I could get away with having silence and mind flay without needing to respec
---
Yes but vampiric embrace is another thing every warlock want.
---
I think theres a difference between doing a run (or 1-2 runs) in the evening and 'grinding' them for hours straight, difference in amount of playtime i guess. Or maybe you did them too often already and dont enjoy them anymore?
---
Yeah, dialects. Doesn't make it a different language
---
It's pretty common to sell the bag to the highest bidder within guilds, gold goes to guild bank
---
You need a healer, or a shitton of gear and consumeables. Otherwise you are pretty gimped tbh
---
It is, just make sure the tank is ok with it, because if it's someone who is a bit new to tanking, seeing 3 or 4 mobs coming can be very stressful. But most tanks will like it as it means they don't waste time pulling. If everyone has health and mana this method can really keep a nice place in a dungeon
---
I have no idea either lol
---
its my first time playing vanilla, the first character i tried to level was a hunter, when i reached gnomeregang i joined a group as tank and said "my pet can tank", we were 5 dps, it took us around 5 h but we cleared it, i have ptsd and i dont wanna run gnomeregan ever again after that
---
Mage goes so much smoother than Rogue or Warrior early levels
---
Dire Maul Tribute solo? Nope.
---
Anyone gives a damn about raid AoE?
---
I've said it before but there are two types of people in WoW Classic. Pimps and bitches. You clearly belong to the latter.
---
I'm colorblind you insensitive clod.
---
That's just false. Tanks csn stack, everyone else should spread.
---
Lmao loser dickhead
---
You know. . . I had a ZF group over the weekend and a 60 druid joined to tank. I went in thinking "oh man, I can relax on heals" but quickly realized that the druid was taking an absurd amount of damage for his level. It was like I was healing a level 45 tank who just had substantially more hp. I've noticed the same pattern while tanking myself. Enemy elites that are green/grey are hitting me close to ones my level. It has been in the back of my mind but I didn't think much of it until I saw this post. This isn't some sort of forgotten 'feature' of classic is it?
---
You’ve got some fucking dumb students.
---
&gt;gut one of your healers
---
You're making it sound a lot worse than it is.  In this spec you mainly with flash heal, which doesn't really suffer from the lack of 20 points in the holy tree, and then cover raidhealing while holy specced priests are assigned targets.  Fights don't last long enough to properly run out of mana.  It's really not as big of a deal as you're making out.
---
No true. Hunter becomes less and less effective with each phase xD
---
These guys are just salty. Look at the top dps on Grobb. Its a fucking Shadow priest
---
Because warrior either reserves a sellable item (boes, orbs, recipes) effectively taking mage chance to roll on it, or they reserve an item they are able to wear. Tanks don't reserve items from tanking gear list (as in they don't announce it, these items reserved to them by default), they reserve DPS items, this means other warriors, rogues and mostly hunters won't be joining this run, so a mage will be accompanied by another mage, lock, spriest etc. i.e. splitting the roll on the item they need with 2 other DPS and an occasional healer.
---
because the mages more often than not aint good and if all the cogs aint working properly it aint smooth
---
in my exprience it aint smooth more often that it is
---
Isnt Onyxia loot tradeable, even if it was a mistake. Or did the guy "accidently" equip it too.
---
Invite more warlocks, they are sure to keep you interested.
---
I see a lot of streamers using an addons  that allows them to make dropdown menus for gear (the way trinket menu works) on their action bars. So for example the will have a button on their action bar with their currently equipped helmet, and when they mouse over it shows the other helms in their inventory and let's them choose which to equip. This addon seems to add a little gear icon in the top right corner of the action bar button. Does anyone know which mod this is?
---
Above sums it up pretty much.
---
It took me many hours and resources (gold for repairs, invis potions and seaforium) to master this run.
---
I am back to slower is faster... 1 death throws you back like 10-15min and you can die by 100 several things.
---
Add:
---
\-random polymorph by the mages at the beginning
---
\-random banish by the warlocks in the middle
---
\-re-aggro mobs after to early feign death cancel or re-summoning your pet
---
I'm a tank and most mages don't think about giving food to the tank but I have never been denied food if I ask for it.
---
I play tauren because i like it... tauren are chill man
---
I actually don’t get the stigma about reserving items, not only does it mean you don’t have to wait two hours for a tank but also if the group leader wants to reserve, well it’s their group, if I don’t like it I just won’t join
---
That is because Zandalar Tribe-EU is just that good. Maybe.
---
No most agree with the op and intentionally show it. I get /w on my mage asking me why I'm hiding it...
---
the shield from the goblin boss, despite giving mp5, is actually pretty good for that level too. i think i didnt replace it until ST
---
At least our portals are free
---
I have to say, this thread gave me a good chuckle. Kronofogden always stirring up trouble.
---
Image me the heard of the addict sound in the Warcraft now
---
Turns out when you're just nice to people and help them, they like it. I think a lot of people playing this game could stand to learn that.
---
**Warlock:**
---
"Jimmy left his Drakefire Amulet even though we reminded everyone 8 times, can you run out and summon him?"
---
&gt;people opening trades without saying a word, no thanking if you actually give them a HS

Shitty pug healers will stop healing you out of spite, even when you're not tapping.

Also

[From] Mage4581: hey man, can you stop farming gold and summon a friend of ours on the other side of this zone?
---
[To] Mage4581: Kinda busy, sorry.
---
[From] Mage4581: We'll pay you 1g
---
[To] Mage4581: &lt;Ask a more reasonable price&gt;
---
[From] Mage4581: Blacklisted, ignored, stop being greedy.
---
ZONES don't require you to get a 5-man group. You cna do them solo. But putting together a group for a 5-man dungeon noone wants for gear is pretty much impossible.
---
What the hell are you smoking ?

Free life tap for 4 other locks
---
Warlocks can solo DM East jump runs though.
---
As a level 30 something casual player, I have no clue what any of this leet speak means.
---
If you genuinely want an advice and not just venting off, given your initial conditions (refusing to reserve), I'd say tank the dungeons, build your own group, don't invite classes which may roll on your gear. Reserving items will do it more quicker but since you don't want to, then don't.
---
6% cap hit is reachable without truestrikes.
---
For HoJ build a party of casters who need arena ogre and golem then run arena-anger-golem runs a lot. Arena chest might be a pleasant surprise.
---
Flip stock on AH and craft Lionheart+buy cloudkeepers.
---
Not that specifically, but Blizz may have flagged it as an RMT transaction.  To me it looks like it was someone sending supplies to their alt and got the name wrong - 200g and 4 runecloth bags seems reasonable for that.  But if it's to another blizzard account the  it would seem different.  Also if the account sending the gold had partaken in RMT the Blizz may have determined the recipient as complicit in that activity.
---
I think if you have like 300 agi, it translates to, lets say for example, 15% dodge at 60, but 30% dodge at level 30. So you could maybe expect more dodges when fighting lower level mobs, I think that is the question, whether it works that way, or even should work that way.
---
People are only raiding for the gear, if they don’t have a ready guild then pugging is their only option
---
Imagine being this wrong.
---
Dunno about that shield.. rage or not, it still has terrible mana efficiency and gets even worse as you get better gear.
---
Great job!
---
I absolutely love it, even tho I am more like a minimalistic UI user
---
That ore or herb is directly useful to that profession, where are rogues still get the LP level off opening it for another person, and greens/potions are group loot
---
Look up the quest for vanquishers sword and do that now. Once you are around 45 look up the quest for thrash blade and do that.
---
Easy solution: Open your own group and do not join these others
---
You are talking about TBC as if it's a confirmed thing, right around the corner. We don't even have phase 2 yet.... Take a chill pill dude.
---
Why would you hurt me like this? I have like 4 tier 1, 1 bloodfang but still no mainhand rend. :') 150+ rend runs.
---
Night Elf hunters are played by literal subhumans
---
Oh so that's why I got assblasted trying to solo lowbie dungeons.
---
Mages
---
it's not really THAT essential. It's been living in my bank since about 2 weeks after hitting 60 since it's so easy to exceed the hit cap that you're often better off wearing 2 crit rings
---
SS procs on every WW hit. So it`s either 8 mobs hit, or 4 mobs hit twice. You can also equip Earthshaker and proc some serious AoE CC with it.
---
Dude mages have lost their damn minds in classic.  Every time one joins my group, it’s 50/50.  50% chance they’re really good and respectful or 50% they are angry, hateful little shits who think pedal to the metal spell cleave runs should be the norm at all times.  I had one pitch an absolute fit because I took a slightly different path to Tinkerer in a princess run.  He started in with personal attacks and even shat on my DPS (I was the tank!).  He linked the DPS meter and said something to the tune is “You’re last in DPS.  I don’t know how you are even holding aggro!”  I told him sunder was my best DPS spell.
---
Not using the AH puts YOU at a disadvantage.
---
Not anyone else.
---
73rd run for hoj. Still looking for SGC but it’s probably been 104ish now?
---
You may be right. I seem to remember there being some sort of reason why the burning legion couldn't directly invade, like some sort of protection over Azeroth. Maybe related to the Dragonflights? Regardless, Lordaeron would have put up some stiff resistance if it weren't for the scourge.
---
well.. it was easy, mark the skull... :P
---
Well that's a really limited view of anything in life, and will lead only to more division and degradation of behaviour.
---
That's the correct response no matter what class you are. Especially because Taunt is melee range. So if people run away I literally cannot catch up unless I Intercept the mob.
---
Large Brilliant Shard. An item used for enchanting gear, acquired by disenchanting high level (lvl 55+) race (blue) gear.
---
It's very nice to have a good reputation. I have a very recognizable name on my Tauren Shaman, and last night i joined a group to do SM graveyard and library, one of the rogues in the group first thing he said was "oh cool, x is a nice guy".
---
I had a warrior need the shield from tinkerer in mara. I, a pally, had the attitude you are describing. He had a crappy low 30s boe green. Even ignoring the intellect and mp5 it was still an upgrade for him. My group got really pissed at him though and all said they were ignoring him right after the run.
---
This used to be my guild forum avatar back in my WotLK priest raiding days
---
My character back then was aptly named thepopeofdope (after a song title) but Blizz made me rename it for the drugs reference
---
I like this post
---
LFG and LFR destroyed the sense of community. They are the prime reasons why their 15 year old version of the game is more popular than their modern updated one.
---
Everything is turned off in interface -&gt; social.  Battle.net as well.
---
&gt;(I do the same in Norwegian).
---
Oh, you're one of *those*.
---
Nah but there's a proper way and a bad way to go about that as well, some take "dialect writing" to some fucked up place which doesn't even make sense *in their dialect*.
---
Goblin if you want: rocket helm (pvp stun), sapper charge (large aoe), the big one (one of the cheaper best grenades with a large radius and 5second stun)
---
Gnomish if you want the death ray (beam that can basically one shot people if you get lucky)
---
I think goblin is overall better imo
---
I hope you at least got the savage gladiator chestpeice and hand of justice. those things are utterly huge upgrades vs any other item you could possibly have in those slots
---
You outted yourselve as a dumbass.
---
That peak display of skill ganking someone 30 levels lower than you.
---
Sure, just going to be annoying/costly to keep sending everything over from your alt that has herb (or AH)
---
Ye its true however sometimes I do feel like I dodge a lot and getting those fatty OP crits feel great.
---
how is the joke on them when you are the one not raiding?
---
I've found this to be the case. Once I stopped worrying about the mages and just let them handle their own threat, I found dungeons to be far more enjoyable to tank. As you said, most mages know how to handle their aoe threat, so I just do my best to keep the nastiest mobs under control, and try to snag any that break a frost nova early, and it's been working great.
---
A good mage is actually a great asset to any dungeon team.
---
What mouse do you use, i seem to have the same issue, do your actual settings in the menu change, mine dont and it just looks like the game is ignoring the settings altogether, it seems to correct itsself when i tab out and back into the game, might be sonething running in the background that causes it, but ive tried shutting everything down other than wow and that didnt fix my problem either
---
Yeah that's fair. Mostly happens to me in strat live as I have done over 30 of those reserved orb runs and know every patrol, pack and ability and how long my interupts and stuns can keep me up. Tanks do also have some tools to compensate for taking to much dmg (granades, holy water, last stand, hp pots, shield wall/block, demo shout, thunderclaps and some others). The only issues I have from my part with healer mana is 
---
1) healers not drinking when I give them a 10s window of non combat 
---
2) healers not healing cause they are on 10% (I can see that mana bar) and want to teach me a lesson to go slower and proceeds to heal the dps once im dead
---
3) dps pulling an extra pack or neutral elites for no reason
---
Healers randomly going afk is also a favorite.. or one I had earlier today who let me die while looking for boxes to loot..
---
That's sick!! How is the faction balance on Yojamba do you think? My shammy is 22 there and seriously considering making him my main until BGs come out
---
Thrash blade is better
---
It may get better with Deadlines but idk about that
---
buffwatch is fine, but i stopped using it. I just manually check the group i was assigned to buff
---
Oof. Too close to home.
---
ive changed some pieces since i posted :v atm 5593 arm 4700 hp +34 deff 20% dodge 11% block and 6% parr yup, that potion and + hp potion are cheap af and worth it
---
You can always help dpsing.
---
You have literally no impact on the WoW economy whether you decide to use the AH or not. You are but a tiny drop on the ocean that doesn't even make a ripple.
---
Also reminder that dispel magic can be used offensively. You can dispel enemy buffs
---
Ofcourse its not adviced to waste gold on buying greens on AH and/or powerleveling professions by AH, but completely 'ignoring' the AH is you just missing out on profits and nothing else. Also two gathering professions is a very common strategy while leveling.
---
You're not part of any problem and dont have to be sorry.
---
I often wish that the game went in a different direction with factions for this reason. I hate Gnomes, I wish they hadn't been made. 
---
I'd much prefer if the Horde was Tauren, Trolls and Orcs, the Alliance Night Elves, Dwarfs and Humans, and a third faction featuring the Forsaken, Blood Elves and Krokul (Broken).
---
That rarely happens. Classic has been launched for, like, two months? Or at least one and a half months. The initial hype is over, as BLZ and many other predicted. Even the most populated servers have no more than two layers, according to BLZ's report. The BfA tourists must've been long gone. Only those who truly love this game stay around.
---
I'm a gnome mage and I camp lowbies in hillsbrad, I even got my HS set to SouthShore in case I wanna have some fun and gank some mages trying to AoE grind those poor farmers. 
---
From the moment they call back up, aka a lvl 60 horde, I always run away as fast as possible. Sometimes they're dumb enough to follow me and I can lure them to Southshore. Knowing when you're outgunned is half the fight. 
---
If horde of my level tries to gank me or w/e I just sheep them and /laugh as I blink away in the distance.  I think the most fun part about all this is when a rogue knows he can't win so he goes into hidding, that works untill I start pumping lvl 1 AoE's as if it was 1939.  At that point I can just take a shit and return to find him still sheeped or nova'd because when they can't hide they're already dead. 
---
If I see horde around my level I always wait when they're on low health/mana. That way I don't burn my CD's so often and makes sure I can repot before their friends start showing up.  
---
Ain't PvP hell? hahahahaha
---
think that's the only reason i am likely to return is for them, at the moment i am more focused on doing the last few levels to 60, but they can be done on 15-20min runs for those 2 bosses don't need to do full runs for them
---
think im at 20 days played :)
---
Only if they're fishing a Patch of Elemental Water.
---
I wish people would note their server (and region) in posts like this, I'm so curious to know if this is region-specific because I don't really experience this shit on Dreadmist EU. 
---
I imagine it's more common on the initial servers (more hardcore people etc.)
---
This time around I've played tank from 1-60 (leveled as Arms tough).
---
I got pretty fed up with the drama in groups sometimes so whenever it happens I kick the source.
---
Made dungeons much more smoother and nicer.
---
Currently leveling a rogue and a priest and I do miss being able to do that because, damn, do people like to argue in this game.
---
You fool. Anal night is off the table as soon as you commit.

Many brothers have walked this path before.

I believe the respawn timers have "windows" of at least a few hours. So the best bet would be to have everyone online during the window, then summon and down the boss as soon as the scouts report he spawned.

"you get a free mount. I'm not giving you more"
---
Yep this is my normal stance, if playing priest I will be dropping SW:P and wanding between heals, but please if you do this hit your fade on every CD.
---
Exactly, people who are smart fill their groups fast. I often do Arena/Anger/Golem lord runs because we can hit the arena for Caster gear like Banthok's Sash, bring a hunter that needs Savage Glad Chain, then hit Angerforge which the rogue needs his HoJ, and finish out with golem lord for the Healer's 2nd Wind.
---
I think if you made a ticket to a GM about this specific issue and you tell them the warrior tried to trade but the item was “soul bound” even though there is a 2 hour limit, I think the GM in this case would happily help transfer the item to you. This is due to 2 “conditions” being met, the first one is the GM saying it was a “mistake” and the other guy saying he couldn’t trade due to being soulbound already. If I’m not mistaken blizzard implemented the 2 hour limit in the first place to avoid this so I don’t see why they wouldn’t help fix it when it actually occurs.
---
Ps do update us if you make a ticket/receive a response so we can confirm their stance on this.

Yeah you can. Really popular on bank alts.

Whoa..I had no idea sap allows for restealth. Other cc too? Gouge/kidney?

Yes you can

Boriska is a true homie!
---
The best dungeon groups I've been in so far have been 4 dps / 1 healer. Especially 4 mages and 1 priest because the mage who gets aggro can kite the boss
---
&gt; This is so hypocritical.
---
+1
---
Although I gotta say I find it absolutely hilarious to be honest :D
---
&gt; I saw it everywhere buddy. It was there.
---
Without visiting the Blizz forums I'm 100% certain there must have been a large number of folks saying it. There seems to be some kind of toxic attitude from people online (not just for WoW, but just in general) regarding folks who claim they want something like this. VR got this a lot too, tons of folks saying VR is a dying market and will have no future, that VR devices are going to disappear. I don't know why they feel the necessity for this aggressively toxic behavior (people who don't play VR going onto VR subreddits or Steam discussion pages for VR and announcing that VR is dead and has no real future), but frankly I'm more than happy to shove this kind of success in their faces.
---
Send that mage a nice thank you note via in-game mail!
---
I'm not entierly sure I understand what is happening here but it sounds a little bit like it could be an api issue(?).
---
The armory feature was not yet a thing in Classic and it sound a lot like that is what this site asks the server to send back.
---
And innervate
---
Writting something with time is much easier than writting in the heat of the moment. I can write just fine for communicating in english, but I cant hold a speak conversation, its much harder to translate in the moment.

The Ag to Dodge ratio doesn't change as you level.
---
right so when you said you got all the loot you needed you actually didnt get literally the only 2 peices of loot warriors actually need from brd.
---
who cares if it's a phone pic. Does max pic quality really matter? Also, they are most likely posting off there phone
---
In general I agree, you either are misunderstanding something or misphrased your statement about the mage boss. He has 3 different options that he can be, depending on what staff he is wielding. The options are priest, shaman, or mage. Mage fireballs, shaman lightning bolt+earth binding totem, priest heal+mindblast+power world shield. He shouldn't be able to switch between them in a single run.
---
Bloodfang is one of the servers made available a week or so into the launch. Apparently the server is a small one
---
Because players on PvP realms are more organized, in both PvP and PvE.
---
Yes, I'd say it would be pretty bad in terms of healing output.
---
Which specc would you run the shadow weave in. I'm thinking about 31/0/20. The problem with that is (IMHO) not the mana but the loss of 0.5 seconds reduced cast time. Added that you also have to stack and hold up shadow weaving you'll loose a lot of potential healing cast time.
---
In this case I think that the raid would probably just go as well without you healing.
---
How very open minded of you
---
our guild is doing 2x20 man groups but phase 3 keeps fucking us over and 1 group 1-shots it easy while the other wipes a few times :S
---
This guide shows my route for an infinite pick pocket route, so killing Plugger actually hinders your run. I agree, though, that killing him when you leave is definitely worth it.
---
Vault runs aren't so good for sub-58 players because you can only open so many vaults. I guess you could add it to the end of the run with Plugger, but sub-58s shouldn't bring 12 keys, as they won't be able to open all 12 vaults.
---
Make a macro.

&gt; /r I've already completed that dungeon but thanks anyway.

P.S.: I have no idea if that macro works, but I think it should.

No, you have got it all wrong. You aren't a problem and you aren't a solution, your impact is so small you are effectively nothing.
---
I'm not a rogue but personally think if only they can open it, they should get it. 
---
I'm not clearing an additional trash pack, just so they can get it though.
---
dropped it on my first run. had a tank with me who did 40 runs without dropping. he rolls 28, I roll 59 .. I felt so bad and happy at the same time
---
people are dumb

Okay, and that's why its ALL profit. Why do you think some big business buy certain companies that have a resource. IE being in freight business and buying a coal mine or oil company etc. It makes your baseline cheaper and makes it easier to sell your product cheaper. People like cheaper products.

Man I'm so disappointed I haven't played much. Level 17. I need to get back on... life got busy!

Gold to respec to holy.

If I were to write something formal I would use 'real Norwegian'. We actually have two different writing languages as well which is acceptable to use in every circumstances. 
---
It's basically old Norwegian which is mostly used in the big cities which is based off of Danish (we used to be under Danish rule) and New Norwegian which was created by a guy going out into villages and making a language out of Norwegian common people and their dialects. 
---
Norway has a lot of different dialects which sounds and looks (if written) completely different from eachother, some of the Northerners I have a hard time understanding lol
---
people pre 60 shouldn't really just grind (except for xp gaps for quest zones/dungeons or lv 40 mount money).
---
if you want gold at lv 60 you farm so much faster
---
Mages farm ZF
---
hunters farm tribute/mara
---
warlocks/priests do mara
---
druids get 300 herb asap and make bank
---
rogues buy keys and do brd key runs
---
Warrior just sell tanking services
---
paladins roll alts
---
As a resto druid with omen of clarity build, I have to get into the fight to get those free healing cast procs, not only does it break up the the down time between heals but it helps the dps and allows the tank to pull more, also mean that - if- I pull aggro for whatever reason the tanks close enough to pull it off me ASAP.
---
Spec bad. Oom fast. No dps.
---
I dont care if it is worth, i just love it as a lock.

You can also go gnomish first for all the trinkets, drop engineering and lvl it again this time taking goblin. All the trinkets will work and you can still make consumables
---
think you can also block all whispers in game settings, not permanently but maybe turning them off for a few hours so you can relax could be nice.
---
It should be and its glorious. If not, it will come in when Naxx is released in P5 or P6.
---
What I wouldn't give to have an ony buff for a raid.  At least I can get DM buffs reliably.
---
What are strat orbs? What do you do with them?
---
Well settings and clock have negligible impact on gameplay, and 1.12 content is still fully Vanilla. Meanwhile, batch reduction is a post-Vanilla QoL that has massive gameplay ramifications. For example, it removes batch-drinking which I enjoyed well into TBC. 
---
I feel the rabbit hole argument is valid because each player has own list of QoL requests. Batch removal to you is as important as dual-spec to my friend. Both are post-vanilla QoLs with massive gameplay effects.
---
That isn’t the same thing. It’s still a punishment handed down by the admins. It isn’t everyone just agreeing to ignore a person.
---
And how was their dps compared to a mage or rogue?
---
Got a source?
---
friends: you should play a priest! me:(plays rogue like a boss)
---
What addon changes your own unit frame?
---
Following
---
Druid - You will never be top of anything
---
it's actually the people without addons (VendorPrice) that do this. any addon worth its salt won't let you post at below vendor price.
---
Good riddance.
---
None. You do a run and invite people who are also interested in doing said run. Should you get lucky and win a roll, you got your item. If not, you do it again.
---
It's as if people are afraid of doing things in this video game. "Oh no, I have to do several runs for this best possible item at this stage of the game, that's terrible!".
---
You and the other posters logic is the reason that World of Warcraft retail such a terrible game. Instant rewards, quick access, no downtime. If you like speed running, go ahead and just play retail.
---
The main 'problem' with the AH is those irritating little fuckers that put 3,000 of items that stack to 100 as single units. I get that there are addons to buy single items in bulk but this really annoys the fuck out of me..
---
Scrolling through page after page after page of single 'Linen Cloth' or something is a huge waste of time.
---
So if anyone reading this is one of those people, I'd just like to say, fuck you.
---
Not really. Both should be geared together. Also most MC fights are all about the MT so one tank should have priority over some gear like FR if they have more FR.
---
If you are a mage or priest you can do exp runs in brd. There is so much runecloth dropping there I think I got around 1000 runecloth from 52 to 60.
---
From revered to exalted you need 8400 runecloth.
---
So no there is not a chanse you get enough on your own while leveling. You need to buy them.
---

---
Our shadow priest pumps. He outdoes the warlocks in our raid almost always and is the best pvp class.
---
I swear all the people farming particular bosses are so unlucky. My guild took me UBRS when I was like Level 56 and I got Briarwood first try lol.
---
Olivergreen Orc Hunter.
---
Pet Name: Diggle
---
Many people don't have the VendorPrice or similar addon, so they don't know for how much the item vendors, and just put it up for either a bit less than the lowest listing, or make up the price themselves.
---
Yea? Rag was dead weak one. Just like onyxia.
---
Right? I’m known for my Sniper Scope Sale Ads and it’s so cool to actually have a reputation in a realm!
---
Well I just hope that they don't "progress" classic into TBC. BLZ devs admitted that progression into TBC is the easy thing to do, but they also said that a large player base hates TBC while others want it. So for now they'll just roll out all the phases and see what happens.
---
lol, exactly. I told them they'll sell their stuff eventually and not to make a big fuss about it :p
---
Spirit Tap awareness.  If you have a shadow priest in your group during trash pulls you should stop dps at about 5-10% mob HP and go to the next mon.  Let the priewr get the last hit and they'll have very little mana problems.
---
Lol, what a garbage attitude, you don't belong to this community.
---
Good tanks are hard to come by. I always add them to friends if I have had a good experience. Enjoy it man!

You’re not “forced” to buy “BiS”. Hell, you’re not “forced” to wear it.

---
You can but with druid/rogue.
---
So he already plays like 90% of the people, you got a pro right there.
---
If it was botting they would've been banned already. Blizzard has talked about this for years now.
---
Projecting much?
---
Some guilds prefer to stay lean and just Merc out raiders instead of attempting to manage such a massive (50+) roster. 
---
I don't believe there is any correlation between guild size and skill level, at least in my experience.
---
Ah, thanks, I think this was my problem. I was trying my hand at grinding at 38, but the rewards of the effort really are best at the much higher levels. I'm going to wait on this until later, I know I can certainly grind for AD rep at higher levels if I wait.
---
1 person will never have an impact by not using the AH.
---
The only way 1 person can make an impact is by buying out everything of 1 kind of item and reposting it for 300% of the original price.
---
But that is hardcore goblin stuff.
---
Not in that set armor though
---
trashblade isnt really the best there is as the proc gives about 4-6% more dmg overall, some1 did the math on reddit. There are also many weapons that you can choose from in the range 50-60. You you really min-max evrything then dalrends are indeed pre raid bis but you can acually get other weapons much easier than those and lose about 1-5% dmg. Now the question comes if it is really worth to spam the dungeon to get them? Take for example mirah which is a quest reward so quite easy to get. Its not that much worse than dalrends when you combine it with a nice main hand.  
---
The other thing to have in mind is the race you are as you get the weapon specialisation racials.  
---
Also answering your question Quelserrar is bis tank sword till u get thunderfury. And its totally worth it for fury too, comparable to raid weapons really when it comes to fury DW.  
---
tldr. dont fall for the min-max craze with all the bis lists as there are a ton of options that wont make much difference when it comes to pre raid "bis" weapons for fury. Also Trash Blade is good but for the level that you get it for, after 55+ its acually not that good.
---
I have that in game. But I mean like when I’m away from my pc and I won’t to find the price of items
---
Do you level slower than molasses flowing uphill in Winterspring? Do you have more alts than you could possibly have time? Do you have an odd fascination with cheese? Are you for the horde?! If so, &lt;Mediocrity in Motion&gt; is the guild for you!

PST Gorgonzola, Spenna, Druscella, or Headcheese in-game for invite
---
We are a casual guild that started on Skywall in May 2005.  We are looking for people of all classes who want to level a billion alts, run dungeons, PVP, and maybe raid when we get to that point. We will accept all levels, but our most active players are between 30-45 in level. Our rules are to have fun, help each other, and love cheese.
---
There are usually groups for timbermaw rep farming usually.
---
Gotta start early! His first game ever is wow. I feel proud.
---
It is multiplicative. But 1k armor when you have 12k isn't that much mitigation so people sometimes pass it or don't put 5/5 once you get gear.
---
Sweet witch hunt
---
I have on numerous occasions seen that hammer blastwave originate from where no players stand.
---
my guess is that the attack can also not be centered at a target. More like an aoe that always are placed to it hits atleast one target.
---
Sadly this is not unexpected when a lot of (not all) swedes play in swede only guilds, and generaly dont think or really play much the rest.
---
Auctionator does? Which addon do you use?
---
I've got the other way around. A tank I befriended on my first UBRS run logs on and whispers me if I want to do Scholomance (I'm a Mage)
---
Bless that dude
---
Wird ja auch Zeit! :)
---
Mage, you will never get loot for raids because everyone is making mage alts for big scale world pvp and gold farming.
---
6 wipes is like 10g worth of repair for plate ...
---
The anti shadow trolling is really strong on reddit, sometimes it gets painful to read these rants about how spriests have 0 dps and that this piss easy Classic content cannot be finished without casting blizzard.
---
I had the opposite experience every group I joined is a fucking mess. Warriors tanking dual wielding, they lose aggro and everyone is getting hit at the same time and I'm sweating my ass pff with my 3 seconds cast healings
---
Were the loot rules established in the raid chat before you looted?
---
Cause if not, they can essentially do whatever you want. 
---
If they had an agreement that all loot will be rolled out and given to the winners then you should report.
---
That's what DKP is for.
---
Perfect for me, but sadly I wont pay for items.
---
And even this is partly a tale that's been made more difficult over the years. Four Horsemen does NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT require 8 Tanks with T3 Sets. One of the suckers is able to be range-tanked (i remember that we used a warlock for this) and taunt resists are simply wipes, but who cares.
---
Taunts won't be resisted 100% of the tries just because of not having T3 and they also won't NOT be resisted just because you DO have T3.
---
4H is a lot about corrdination and guess what, nowadays players are pretty good at that.
---
Saph is something you can prepare quite a bit for regarding the required materials that only come from Nacc itself. However, you are able to circumvent this a bit by simply having other strong Frost Resistance gear. I have  a pretty strong feeling that as long as healers coordinate which groups they focus on that Sapp won't be too much of a hassle. But we'll have to wait probably 18month until we're gonna figure this one out.

Really? Most everyone I know actually would be more excited to play a tbc server than a classic one. They just worry it would fragment an already small playerbase if there were vanilla and tbc servers concurrently, so figure it'll never happen.
---
LFM is looking for members
---
Res is reserved aka that piece of loot is reserved for someone already in the group and you are to pass on it
---
No, because their damage is only avoided or mitigated via armor. So they don't hit you as hard at 60 as they did at 32 because you will inherently have more armor.
---
This standing 2 by 2 tactic is new to me. Weve always just spread out and i feel like im rarely nocked. Theres so much room.

I would also wanna know this!
---
I'm so envious of the guy who bought that.
---
Don't worry homes, I had to enlist the help of a dwarf since the horde on my realm apparently don't do much questing.

Well I know that much!
---
Not a chance that sword was any good during because . That sword started to lose relevance during BWL
---
You can turn those off in the settings (I know I did cuz I can't stand them either)
---
Nobody said that.  People said there would be a dropoff.  And there has been, although of course, the level of it varies.  Let's not pretend classic is anything perfect, as its flaws are readily apparent to people.  That doesn't mean it's a bad game, and it also doesn't mean retail is a bad game (although...) just for a different demographic.

This classic circlejerking has gotten really old.

I just hope he was tired and read the description too quick and thought it was damage and healing. the description does look very similar at a glance

Thanks! Played hunter for years and didn't know this.

That depends. But ye, orcs are pretty neat (however you are bound to axes).

I happened to get the OEB in my first MC, and it's my only epic. Rest of my gear is a smattering of blues, some pre-raid BiS, some not. I am hit capped (6%) and have around 27% crit raid buffed. My spec is 0/31/20 fury/prot. 
---
Two nights ago, during our guilds first kill of Ragnaros, I was 3rd on the damage charts. Some of that is due to my competition dying partway through (I wore 119 fire resistance, they did not) but I was astonished that I would do so well without Impale and with a 2H. I also don't have enough gear to use slam (not enough rage). It just goes to show you how powerful fury warriors are.
---
I 3 man farmed mara in my early 50s with two guldies. I think we did 1 full clear and about 10 princess (+ goblin + crocodile) runs before we got their entire loot tables (minus the epic dagger). Poor you :(
---
Why your fury warriors using tier though
---
Horde don't get the flight path for free.  They have to run the full length of the zone.  Alliance can come down from darkshore with the docks.  I know which is safer for a pvp server.
---
Why do you DW if you're Deep prot ?
---
You need a shield to Shield slam and that's your big aggro skill ...

Farm the Dreadforge Retaliator off Emperor in BRD. It drops fairly often, and if you get it, you can raid 2H. Without it, just stay dual wielding. The extra weapon skill from axes really is that powerful.
---
Yeah i can image you
---
Same here, I consider myself pretty lucky almost all of the gear I've gotten on my druid were the same color - green.
---
There were better options, sure. It was still decent due to the proc.
---
Ayyy I found myself!!!
---
What you're describing is the standard workplace environment.
---
Me and my friend made taurens... Moomen rider and Winniethemoo
---
Yup. People often spend more time trying and sometimes failing to figure out ways to skip packs than it wouldve taken to just kill them.
---
It’s a bit more complex than that
---
Homie you must have been watching TV while replying too, I’m a shadowpriest and have to dot everything up with downranked SwP and then spam MF to match the mages on the meters without it costing all my mana!
---
Agree with the replies here, this guy is obviously a troll
---
Sounds like some pretty odd healer behavior you're describing there. Healing dungeons while leveling conditioned me to sit down and chug water when exiting combat like someone who just walked out of the Tanaris desert and found one of those waterskins. As long as there is mage water I can do those 5-10sec sips, if I pay for my own water I will insist on getting to drink up though. Burned through 60+ vendor waters on a full BRD run without a mage, but BRD is in a category of it's own.. 
---
I don't know, tanks seem to be in so short supply, whenever I party with a reasonable/decent one I do my best to make it a smooth run and befriend them in the process. Having a goodish number of tanks in your Friends list certainly doesn't hurt.
---
IMO not worth the burnout.  Take a break and try to get some lesser upgrades that are more common drops or do something else you like doing.  Hopefully you can just join a PUG or guild MC/ony and get some drops that will be better than your pre-bis so you don't have to worry about those slots anymore (happened for me).
---
As a pally, yes, your main dps consist of melee, seals (little 30sec buffs to melee), and judgement (consuming seal to do something extra).
---
Basically you never ever want to swing a melee hit without a seal activated, as it's a wasted opportunity. So when you consume a seal via judgement you want to have enough time to reapply a seal before your next swing, which be problematic if you judge a seal right before you swing.
---
This is kinda niche and something many don't pay attention too, but it's something I want to point out. Time your swings fellow pallys.
---
Yea quite honestly it sucks this has happened to you but as soon as I see its not my server what am I gonna do?
---
I keep running into this druid on Earthfury. Names fucking Batpiss lol. All I remember is his name made me laugh so damn hard I wasnt even going to breathe heavy in his direction. Spent maybe an hour and a half killing trolls in STV and when I accidentally pulled too many, there was Batpiss. I remember screaming at another group of Horde to stop because they thought him being that close to me and seeing his attack animations was him killing me lmao. I dont care what happens in regards to world PvP, could be a city raid, I will never /tar Batpiss. Batpiss, If you see this, Glorp remembers. Reputation is absolutely a huge thing on classic. Its what made me pick it up to play in between retail lulls.
---
The same applies to literally every other levelling dungeon in the game.
---
Most leveling dungeons get skipped by people who wants to level efficiently. 
---
I don't see it as a big deal if the 58+ dungeons get forgotten after being all the rage for almost 2 years.
---
"DAE have 15 kids, 4 wives, 5 jobs, leaving them with exactly 22 minutes per day to enjoy the Classic Experience? It isn't much, but I'm proud of my level 24 after 2 months."
---
Have you tried questie?
---
Make one then :-)
---
Loool sure; afk in cities; no farming at all; suuuuuuure bud; are u even 60 yet?
---
Thanks! I can see why they would be wary of them then. Lmao
---
Incorrect, they never transfer items even if rules has been stated and it was ninjaed anyway. The only thing that MIGHT happen is that the Master Looter who ninjaed will be banned.
---
you get bonus exp for more people so you should always take as many as you can if you're boosting
---
Haven't played warrior in a long while now but I recall using mouse4 and mouse5 for two of the stances felt really good
---
Jesus Christ no one is forced to play either. But if you want to play and want to maximize your efficiency, the most ideal situation is wearing BiS items. So if that's your goal, you are forced to buy em or get lucky and see them drop.
---
I do this with a second monitor. Just put on Netflix or my watch later playlist on YouTube and just zone out for hours. A season later you're a bar away from dinging and made a good deal of progress in questing or made a decent chunk of change.
---
What race are you?
---
Questie shows available quests (quest givers) on your map. I found several quests I completely would have missed or forgotten about thanks to it.
---
But that's after those dungeons being ran for almost 2 years.
---
Can’t change aspects though
---
What do you fish up? I spend a short while levelling fishing every evening and only thing that makes good money is winter squid.
---
Don't forget the scrublock who lifetapped himself to 1% and refuses do bandage/eat. Another 10 seconds of drinking
---
More ramp means you have less concern on how fast you can dps.
---
Also, if you can mind flay in your raid, you will be far more likely to do good dps.  Remember that debuff slots are limited and mindflay is not a priority.
---
#fuckquestie but you can turn off where the quest objectives are in it
---
My obeservation is, that they turn towards the direction they were facing when combat started.
---
I was actually thinking about something like that the other day! Thank you! :)
---
They should have added an RpPvP realm months ago. But still, it's great.
---
Was looking for this comment. Like 2 weeks ago I did some interaction with Elontusks (can't remember what) but the name got stuck in my head.
---
What good even is a binding for a PuG warrior with no guild? Makes no sense they'd want to take it from a guild MT.
---
3 possible explanations:   
---
1) the GM was an idiot   
---
2) You are leaving out crucial information   
---
3) Its a made up story   
---
Fact is, if loot rules were clearly communicated ingame and then broken in obvious fashion, GMs do act.
---
I'm currently using TukUI and am fairly happy with it overall.
---
Was wondering if anyone had solutions to 2 problems I'm having with it:
---
1. Is there a way to have the exact health/mana/rage totals written as numbers on the portrait bars at all times? For example the exact mana amount isn't shown.
---
2. Is there a way to turn off the buffs/debuffs above the player portraits? I like to have my player portrait and target portraits near the top of the screen but that means the buffs/debuffs are off the top of the screen. Can they just be turned off/moved to under portraits?
---
I haven't found a solution to these in the TukUI settings. Was wondering if I'd missed something or if there are other mods out there which work well with TukUI.
---
Mage: Every retard on azeroth wants portals and food/water from you. 
---
Oh and your gonna spend 50% of every dungeonrun drinking.
---
What about on the skeletons and the mobs before jandice. Those things hit hard still.
---
I lost the pre bis healing pants to a mage in my brd run I've yet to see trinket.
---
Naxx out???
---
Its not about dps; its about ooming after every 2nd pack
---
You can consistently top the flag capture charts.

You’ll be healing at 60 so don’t worry about it.

You can use wikipedia, but make it your own...
---
Tradeskillmaster.com stated two months ago that they would support pricing for Classic out of game, but I only see retail realms in the list. Maybe soon? *Fingers crossed*
---
Didn't seem to work sadly. Maybe more blood of dwarves is needed.
---
Crusader enchant.
---
Ye it crazy how classic is a completely different game right?  
---
I have around 20 tanks on friends list, with notes who when and where. So get used to the whispers, cuz they will never stop.
---
If they fishing they're cool and I leave them be
---
This issue was fixed, I think you're using an old version (1.7 probably)
---
Easy to assume the player base has dropped by 90% lmao. Dude. 
---
Like maybe on this particular Tuesday only 10% of the people who originally created characters on launch will log in, but 9/10 people who played classic on launch haven’t all permanently quit. 
---
Everyone’s a statistician though and spouts these random “facts”
---
I'm leveling a druid alt and pretty much I'm a tank/healer/dps in one :\] and we had a rdruid healer in our first MC (hard to find druids) and at level 59 he got 4T1 from his first MC run...
---
U need to be 37+ to get the vanquisher sword
---
Yeah.  We have 8 fury warriors in our guild, and all of them except one has the Dal Rend's set, and 3 combat rogues that have it.  I think we have 2 briarwood reeds total out of all of our casters.
---
Ganking used to mean killing someone while they were fighting a mob, usually at medium or low health and completely unable to fight back.
---
Apparently I earned a reputation for being a good enchanter because someone messaged me the other day saying I was their guild's go-to. Feelsgoodman.
---
Druid loot drop rate intensifies
---
This was always the case in Vanilla. What you think is a bug did not get implemented into WoW until TBC or WoTLK.
---
I try to do dmg and MC if I know the mob has good air or a heal.
---
By proper I mean people who actually know what they're doing.
---
But yes, you're correct.
---
Plz don’t make me heal again.
---
I almost got upset, until I saw you say "make sure the tank is ok with it." I am perfectly fine with the healer or even dps pulling, as long as they've cleared it with me (the tank), or we have an established relationship (friends).
---
It can be easier to write thought out paragraphs than to communicate in real time with other people, or at least that’s how I felt writing essays in Spanish vs talking to people. Anxiety is a bit part of that though and OP is definitely doing great
---
In MC mages only use blizzard on imp and core hound packs, and you'd be a fool to try and SW:P those. In dungeons spamming SW:P is super mana inefficient, especially since mobs die in less than half of its duration.
---
This is all about boss DPS, which shadow isn't that bad at, but at best you will be on par with a pure DPS class while taking up 3 debuff slots. And that's mostly because no fights in MC are long enough to reveal mana issues.
---
YOU NEED A LEVEL 10 RETAIL CHARACTER TO POST IN THE CLASSIC FORUMS.
---
C'mon dude. Obviously....
---
As others said, we grind rep the hard way.
---
OP: can you just make your point already? You seem so laser-focused on telling this guy he’s wrong but you have not made any point of your own. Make your point independently from his argument. If you can’t then you have no point and you’re just arguing to argue.
---
all about aligning incentives to get the job done. it's beautiful really
---
It happened for me, and my next roll was a 100...now THAT is something happening only once every 50.000 rolls if we include party need/greed rollers :-P

Thanks, i'll give it a go.

i Think 1k needles and shimmering flat shouldve ben alot bigger. Not just one long tunnel a few pillars wide but en enitre zone that you basicly gets lost in! :D

There really shoudlve been an arakkora like species up in the trees in feralas. With brides across them nd such. Couldve been an entire "2nd floor" to the zone. 
---
Im not a fan of how stratholme and blackrock spire have been split up into two distinct parts. Woudlve prefered a more seamless transition between them. Make them feel more like brd with multiple routes to go.
---
Fuck that dude. Put them on
---
But the reserve runs you don't like are a staple in World of Warcraft classic  and retail eliminated them (at least from what I remember from 2014 when I quit, iirc they introduced the personal loot either shortly after or before I quit). I see certainly contradicting parts in your logic.
---
If you're in a pug 100% need unless you have some reason to really trust those people, almost every pug will all need boe blue/epic from my xp. 
---
If you're in a guild, it should probably be determined beforehand and potentially purely masterlooted anyway, so ymmv for how trustworthy your group/raid is. Even in a guild there would probably be that one asshole who would need just to auction when everyone else greeds.
---
Prot pally here, and I'm having a great time. Aoe tanking dungeons is great fun and I can take 3 mobs at once for quests. As far as PvP goes, I don't feel like I'm at a disadvantage at all
---
I don't want it to fail, but I do believe that it's going to be a "dead" game soon. Playing on one of the biggest servers right now, orgrimmar is pretty damn empty off peak and leveling an alt I rarely ever see anyone. 
---
We know the population dropped off considerably already as there were 10+ layers on launch and now the biggest servers only have 2, soon to be down to 1. If blizzard is trying to recreate the vanilla experience as they say they are, we can safely assume that the biggest servers would only hold 3-4k players on 1 layer, too. 
---
I'm not worried about my server, I'm sure there will be a decent population all the way til naxx, but for smaller servers? I can see them dying before the end. We might even see server merges.
---
A LOT of people just wanted to test it out because it was the new thing that everyone talked about, you can see it on twitch as well, viewership went up by a crazy amount on launch and has since dwindled back to more normal numbers. It's gonna happen to the next game, too. Gaming is a cycle. Most people try out new games for a little while then progressively stop until the next big release. It's been like that for years. You can see it happen in real time just by looking at the twitch game categories.
---
So create your own group and give out all items? Being carried through a raid by a good guild has a cost. If you want no res, create your own. Easy as that.
---
First ony raid i did i got hit [4 times](https://imgur.com/y4W9aGC) in a row by that god damn fireball.
---
Prio 
---
1. Hit at 9%
---
2. Crit 24% 
---
3. Range ap
---
I made an alt for alchemy and early on all low/mid level herbs were super cheap so I got way more than needed. Now when I'm almost 35 with him I have a likely overstock of things like purple lotus and some of golden freaking sansam. My main is mage with tailor/mining but I'm very likely to drop mining soon.
---
Also if you have fishing then you can constantly make free action potions.
---
I’ve done BRD a few times and everytime I always see the same rogue from my first rune, that OG brother.
---
man, Dysphoria’s hunter vs world from Tbc were another level. I still have downloaded a lot of her videos
---
People have always done it, they just wouldn't announce it. Stacking group with classes that don't roll on the loot they need.
---
Once loot actually takes a lot of farming/luck to get, people start stacking things in their favor.
---
Closer to 1K6 on my server :/
---
&gt; He technically needed it, since he did not have two useful trinkets, but 300 mana on a 15 sec CD aint that hot, I feel like he could have let me have it. :(
---
If that would be the only stat I could understand it. But since it has +healing on it as well, there's no discussion that healer should have priority.
---
RemindMe! 10 hours
---
With 6% you should only use an axe as an Orc. You need at least 9% or Edgemasters to use other weapons.
---
TBC is first step toward retail. Many horrible modern wow features for convenience and vanity can be traced back to TBC. People play classic because they hate those features. Some have gone through all those expansions, some never played vanilla wow, but they both want to experience the original WoW, most importantly the social aspect. Progression into TBC defeats that purpose. Plus, unlike Azeroth that is completely reshaped through a cataclysm in Cataclysm, Outland remains intact throughout the years. In retail you can simply go there and pay a visit to all the raid bosses anytime.

This guy is bad.

He dosen't even loot all the boxes in the vault.
---
well great, now I'm paranoid, I killed over 140 gorillas for the aged gorilla sinew outside of Booty Bay and didn't drop it. I just checked wowhead and the icon is literally the same as rugged leather. when I get home from work, I'm totally gonna check the bank for random "rugged leather" icon...
---
I remember all my EQ buddies calling WoW a theme park because it was cartoony and fast paced.
---
Well actually shadowpriests are at their worst in dungeons. No aoe and massive mana problems after every trash pull.
---
This is so wholesome it hurts my teeth.
---
It could be that the tank is trying to preserve rage by using cooldowns that keeps him in combat while you are drinking. Especially in groups with trigger happy fire mages or big crit opener rogues having that extra bit of rage to make for a strong opening move makes the run a lot smoother. However, if the rage bar is empty then eating (or rather healing myself as druid) is something I always try to do.
---
you are never forced. you just gain an advantage of spending alot of time in game.
---
Thanks! I can see why they would be wary of them then. Kek
---
Yea. Whelps on onyxia, ads on ragnar p2 are a couple of examples. You NEED mages for those.
---
I like questie
---
I like to imagine this weird mechanic as this: while in fear panic  you get that adrenaline rush that  makes your body do things you never thought possible :D
---
I’ve been recognized quite a few times on the zeppelin or in groups, guess our server is friendly
---
I had a healer get upset at me in UBRS last night because he was getting low on mana after every pull. Now, I was dual-wield tanking, but there were a variety of reasons for this (dps were going crazy, and DW was the only wait I had enough rage to keep threat, and the other healer said he was fine with my damage intake). I also had a macro to throw on a shield if shit went bad (like when we pulled an extra pack a couple of times.
---
Now, if I'm stressing out my healer, of course I'll throw on a shield and tank normally. I'll just tell the dps to hold back a bit. I also don't pull until my healer is nearly full on mana. But he was complaining because he felt it'd be faster if he didn't have to drink after every pull, but it was honestly faster for me to DW so the dps didn't have to throttle.
---
What are your thoughts in this kind of scenario? Also note, if both the healers had said something, I would have immediately obliged, but I had one healer who said "Keep DW, it was boring before" and another saying "I hate having to drink after every pull"
---
Guidelime mixed with questie &lt;3
---
Sure, SW:P is one of the best dots to have up, but having it as a large chunk of your DPS still means part of your performance comes from a limited raid budget.
---
I can group hunter, rogue and ench-shaman in one category.
---
The uninviteables!
---
Every 5-man prebis grind group will need a tank. This would be fine if the tank was running for tank gear, but oh no. The tank needs his dps gear and tank gear. 
---
This was never a issue in vanilla, since most people did not blindly follow bis lists online. But now they do. 
---
Full leather warriors, i like to call them rage rogues. These rage rogues cant be arsed to roll for their gear, it must be defaulted to them. Competing for the same loot, the warrior simply states "only caster dps" and he's solved.
---
The only hunter and rogues that can gear in a steady pace gets boosted by their guild tank who actually plays tank and have zero plans on going dps. The others are left to wait until their sub runs out or reroll class.
---
pull the shield out of your bag when shield slam is about to come off CD, slam the boss, put shield back into your bag
---
Bingo.
---
I don't know why anyone gets triggered by this, you see these messages because they spam them because these groups never fill.
---
How do you re-progress through 20 years of stuff? That sounds amazing and horrible at the same time.
---
I need it.
---
&gt;Guidelime 
---
Which guide do you use?
---
Where are you getting the idea the rules weren't stated beforehand?
---
As a raid tank I jizzed on this
---
Okay so, if all alliance players just went to pve server, then that would make every server a pve server. The problem is faction imbalance, not pvp.
---
Its funny how the role of dps is left out,
---
But atleast now you know that taunt exist and is the answer to everything threat.
---
That's what gnomes all say till they stab you in the back of the knee. It's always a gnome mage
---
Human, though with OEB, it hardly matters. Without it, you could attribute my ability to wear FR gear to me only needing 6% hit, vice 9%, but OEB makes that irrelevant.
---
Ahh good old #NoChanges crowd seem to just come in out of no where
---
Find a different thread to complain mate, we arent even talking about that here, no matter how much you want us to.
---
I would imagine most guilds are just posting what their required raid nights will eventually be.  For example our guild is 2 days 3.5 hours each.  Our last Thursday raid was a 20ish min Ony run (we suck at buffing groups) followed by everyone splitting up and running Dire Maul or logging off early.  Still advertise our set raid times though because BWL eventually will probably come close to maxing us out (don't think we will be killing bosses in 15 secs like some guilds, ever).
---
Can you lockpick the coffers?
---
My point is that DPS are not generally bad? That's in the title of my post and the post itself?
---
No He won't, he appears hostile but is actually passive.
---
If you're struggling to get 9% hit consider going to Surefooted on Surv at the cost of BM talents. 3% hit from talents is very useful if you are having problems with hit on gear - especially when trying to move from prebis to t1.
---
There are a few from dungeons listed by the others, a lot of them are world drops and you just have to buy them. There are quite a few from reputation coming out in a later phase so you could work on getting rep up now to buy them when they come out.
---
&gt; greedy manchild beggars that needs to be spoonfed.
---
Have you spoken to a therapist about these feelings?
---
&gt; Out of those, almost NO ONE knows how to play shadow priest.
---
Ah, the classic *"No one but me can play the spec properly"*. Good stuff. 
---
For the record, the top-placed SPriests on Ragnaros (the first boss resembling a real fight, mind you) are placed at #469 and #478, both relying on both Innervate + 1-2 Power Infusions. Meanwhile, they are being beaten by Mages/Warlocks that aren't being buffed by either of those spells.
---
Is there an add-on that will warn me when my underwater breath is low?
---
I play druid, and a few times I'm so into fighting the mob that I accidentally don't watch my breath timer and get close to drowning.
---
Questie won't guide you step by step but it will help you finish quests and see where you can get more quests. It's the best if you want to have freedom of choice and not just follow a guide to the last letter.
---
That's because they came from behind!
---
LoseControl I believe. I need to look into those as well, specifically enemy buff indicators. Those reflectors are really annoying D:
---
You might want to step away from the game for a little bit my friend...
---
Yes, I misread. My bad.
---
I found claassic aura durations for timers
---
Not true. The target is audience in anyone in for anything other than those audiences who need the reserved items. I’ve only ever hosted one “reserved” run, and my offer as a tank was that gems in LBRS were reserved but I would be passing on all loot as compensation. Filled in less than 5 minutes.
---
Druid dps healer...? Either ur speced resto or feral. No druid dps main heals, nor off heals very seldom and if so they are making a huge mistake.
---
Nope, you need keys to do it
---
Well it is a bit debatable since execute is quite large part of their dps and they have massive threat problems. For example in Onyxia they are among the worst dps classes since they bring zero ranged dps and the fight is all about threat.
---
Alright first of all, to prevent personal accusations, I have never taken anything for tanking. 
---
But I still don't get your comment at all. How the fuck is this blackmail? Nobody is forcing you to use rent-a-tank. Is Hertz blackmailing you when they charge you for a rental car, because usually you find a colleague or friend going the same way who takes you along for free?
---
If you get a properly specced, fully geared tank who knows the dungeon inside-out and pulls you through it in decent time without issues, I can totally see why people would prefer this to spamming LFG for half an hour. It's maybe 10g per player, and any DPS class farms that in 10-15 minutes or so.  There are clearly more groups looking for tanks than there are tanks who actually need the respective dungeons, if rent-a-tank adds some more tanks to the pool I can only see a win-win. Obviously this doesn't apply to low level or still gearing tanks who actually need stuff from there, if they try to charge you laugh them out of your group.
---
Found the huntard.
---
why? you sound like a clueless retard in denial
---
what keeps people playing ret paladins
---
what is fun about bottoming the damage meter while auto-attack fishing for seal of command procs through the course of entire dungeons
---
Well of course it can only do one global action per click. You have click/press it multiple times.

I don't think it's worth doing the full run *unless* you're a miner. Besides that you wouldn't compare the potential, but the average. Of course 3 veins with a crystal on each tap is going to be worth far more than whatever you can get in a tribute but it's not even worth mentioning such an unlikely scenario.
---
I am pretty sure they have dropped quite a few people, and we are not even in phase 2 yet. Gonna be interesting to see how it turns out.
---
You get a tank spec &amp; reserve. If you refuse to reserve then you go as a tank &amp; say you're rolling as DPS.
---
Kinda have a job :/ not the best excuse but apparently I need money
---
I know that some people get salty about it, but I live getting gold elims and gold heals as Moira.
---
You will have a very easy time finding a raid as a healer, very hard time finding a raid as any other spec. One of a guild's druids will also pick up feral gear probably, but you will still be a healer most of the time.
---
Well, it is a simple calculation: you need X total XP to reach 60 and each zombie kill gives you Y XP. (take in to account this lowers as you level up)
---
X divided by Y will tell you have to do Z kills to reach 60.
---
The undead (might as well farm argent dawn rep too) in WPL have about a 37% drop rate meaning you will have about Z x 0.37 runecloth in the end
---
According to wowhead you need 8400 runecloth to go from revered to exalted
---
Did someone pay such a tank already? I'm just curious how do they look. Are they at least half epic from raids or completely full preraid-bis? Cuz I would expect some kind of quality, since I'm paying that tank.
---
My guild raffles them.
---
Pay 10g entry fee to roll. Top 1-2 rollers win the bag(s). 3rd highest wins the blue/green items.
---
Pretty easy way to rake in at least 200-250g for gbank every 5 days.
---
they pre-released DM before P2.
---
Right now it's also only my opinion, that it won't be worth it. I don't know for sure either.
---
&gt;We're going to test measure and evaluate
---
Please do hit me up afterwards, it'd be nice to have some data to go after.
---
Would fiery weapon enchant stack with a chance on hit on the weapon like axe of deep woods or is +weapon damage better?
---
to be honest I call 1 arcane crystal per run lucky :P
---
What's better at that level for a hunter? I need to up my hit/crit
---
Reserving is fine lol it's only a game. As long as you're honest about it there's no issue.
---
4 day cooldown, makes 1 at a time, and you have to physically travel to a moonwell to do the craft.
---
Zygor is pretty good now they've reverted to their original vanilla guides.  It's not going to break any records though, nor is it intending to.  Its goal is to make sure you don't run out of quests so everything is comfortable with minimal grind.  There are still a few grind steps at the end of some levels but if you kill mobs as you travel you can cut a lot of that out.   It strikes a nice balance between gold accrued, rep, and xp.
---
Currently there's very few druids and most of the time you'll be the only one in a raid. If you want to get into a guild for future content, it's better to do it early, because guilds will only want a few druids in the long run.
---
proof? Can't just make claims like this man
---
Funny, I always appreciate Pally tanks because they have to drink regularly. Means I can get my mana up as a healer as well. Worst part of being a healer is when the tank thinks he can decide how much mana I need.
---
Game isn't even 2 months old. If you think this is proof that classic is successful, you're an idiot. Population already dropped down massively compared to launch - as expected. Twitch viewership is also down by a ton. It was the game of the week/month for september, that's it. 
---
It's gonna dwindle down to a niche game for very specific players and most people won't even know it still exists a year from now. 
---
Posts on this sub circlejerking about how literally 100s of millions of players would be playing this game and how it's the best game ever made in the history of gaming before launch were upvoted to the top daily. They were wrong. This game is successful in the sense that there's a decent playerbase for it and it will generate more revenue than it cost to create and maintain. That's it. 
---
I don't even know why you guys are so fucking insecure about game popularity. It's fine to enjoy something that's not mainstream. People still play runescape and you don't hear them crying every day about how their game is totally not dead right guys look there's a screenshot of 10 people this is a success the haterz were wrong haha upvotes to the left amarite guize!!
---
P99 only progresses through 1999-2000 content. Up to Velious.
---
got questie at 53 and it really changed my questing experience. able to almost mindlessly hit mobs and don’t necessarily need to read the quest, though for some i still do
---
I'm not saying they weren't.
---
But every time someone posts a ninja accusation (which, to be clear, I believe) they don't bother posting a screenshot of the actual rules.
---
again, if the run is made with ML he can't do whatever he wants with the loot unless clear and unmistakable loot rules were stated before the run begins.
---
I’m more upset at the lack of patch-notes. 
---
Sure, nerf or fix stuff, but can you at least inform us or say why you changed something.
---
I’ve done the same with vanish, fk them selfish aoe mages
---
you obviously didn't read the 2nd part of my comment. I don't mind it as long as it's within reason, but some tanks had crazy demands. Luckily they seem to have overdone it as that guy was laughed at and was "forced" to reduce his demands.
---
I get that feeling while swimming.
---
You can get Devilsaur set for 250-300g, Battlechaser Boots from AH for 40-60g.
---
Mirahs song from a quest reward. 
---
Rune of the Guard Captain from a quest.
---
Black hands Breadth which I assume you have since you’ve done that many UBRS.
---
Mark of Fordring from a quest chain. 
---
All these items are a great start to your BiS gear.
---
We have "would you date a girl who.....". Fml, I've put so many on ignore from the world chat spam.
---
Yeah, pet's like to position themselves behind the target when somebody is already attacking it. So the tank should give it some extra leeway.
---
Looks like you're using a different display of combo points? What addon is that?
---
Thanks for video btw man, good stuff :)
---
Yeah, but then warriors replace the damn thing in BWL, so it's still a waste.
---
Its a meme pvp weapon regardless, but if you're going to make one for whatever reason (status, I suppose), might as well place it where it'll be seen for a longer period of time (shaman/paladin).
---
These whispers "hey need a heal last spot" are driving me crazy on my enhancement sham. Let me be a subclass in peace
---
Got you, fixed at 1.8.1
---
If I was a resto shaman on my 10th run looking for the mp5 ring and a warlock, who has infinite mana as long as they have health, rolled on it.... I'd be fucking tilted.
---
There's two reasons for this:
---
1) hundreds of single stack items makes you more money for two reasons.  Firstly there often no deposit for single stacks, and secondly, the people who *do* use add-ons are much more likely to spend 1c more per item if they can buy exactly what they need.
---
2) It slows down auto scan addons.  Some people stack thousands of linen (no deposit) to make the addons not work as well.

If blizz waits until after retails next content patch in January, 6 months of molten core might really wear on some folks.
---
Hunters complaining about life being tough. Lol
---
Elaborate... 
---
  All I see is you saying dudes wrong with no evidence or explanation as to why
---
They are staple due to how players behave (and accept them). I'm not sure what your point is with personal loot in retail? The fact that they went with that made it easier for everyone to get loot, made people do less dungeons and more content-skipping because it's easier to just not do stuff because there are 100 alternative ways to go about it.
---
That's not a good solution. It doesn't make reserving a better idea either.
---
Layer drop-off is an easy indicator.
---
Same thing happens to me as a pally, I get asked constantly to tank/heal groups by people I met a long time ago while I was still levelling. Or even just standing around IF bank people recognise me and say hi, it feels good ay.
---
Thank you
---
God I know right? Imagine thinking your entitled to something just because it arbitrarily fits your class, when anyone in the party could use it.
---
Organize your own raids then. Leading a pug of 40 people will in most cases require many hours of preparation in terms of recruiting people, assigning everything, raid leading, and so on. Why on earth would someone try to lead a pug unless there was a reward for their efforts?
---
nobody swap because of gankfest. Thats just something PVE players are telling themselves.
---
Of course it is, you don't even need herbalism since in the end it is all about the gold it would cost you. Leveling herbalism 1-300 will yield you much less gold than you can earn doing other stuff in the same time.
---
Ah ok guess ill just keep going at it thanks.
---
To be fair, most of the in-game character names are puns. I'm sure there's a John Smith character somewhere, but mostly they seem to be puns or punnable.
---
Puns that relate to class / race characteristics would be fair game I would think (I'm by no way an authority so ymmv depending on server). Names that clearly refer to OOC things would, imho, be more likely to be reported.
---
Speaking of selective memory, remember how there were posts upvoted daily on this sub "predicting" that classic wow was going to literally create a new era of gaming and how *literally* 100s of millions of people would be playing that game?
---
The Epic Warlock mount (Dreadsteed) has a long quest chain, at the very end of the quest chain it requires 3 items totaling 250g to complete an event in Dire Maul West, It doesn't require the person on the quest to buy/use the items. So if 1 Warlock buys the items they can use them for another Warlock's quest. If 100g is charged by the Warlock with the items it saves the Warlock getting their mount 150g.
---
And only 10% of the mages I've encountered give me water without asking
---
Jesus
---
Sorry. But you need to get a life
---
Most of the rest of it is just specific instances/gear. You should pick up on it pretty fast once you hit level 52ish and start running these dungeons
---
If they're not worth a lot of money, they can just buy one then can't they?
---
I believe the one I use is called NugRunning.
---
Pog
---
That first guy is just a douche. Add him to your ignore list.
---
If a chest is locked, and theres no blacksmith with a skeleton key or emgineer with a sapper charge, then it's the rogue's chest.
---
I usually take whats in it and then ask if anyone in the group needs any of this crap. If they want it they can have it. If theres a blue or purple in there, everybody rolls.
---
holy shit WHY DO WE NOT HAVE THIS?!
---
To clarify, are you asking to level with restoration spec or leveling as druid in general?
---
I certainly wouldn't recommend to level with full healing spec as that could be rather slow. Up to the late 50's you have no problem to heal even while putting most points in feral talents. Just have a healing set ready with lots of int/spi/mana reg.
---
meh.  my bear form works just fine for dps/threat.
---
In pvp too. Lvl 30 can stun, sap, fear and hit lvl 60 with little problem. Dunno if it was the case back then.
---
Playing a warrior I have tried to use it for hamstring kiting etc. I have found that I am unable to do it, or that I get so stressed out and get tunnel vision that it’s not fun. 
---
But I am sure it’s useful if you can hack it.
---
Nah no way you can out DPS mage, rogue or warrior
---
Got a link?
---
dunno, I never did. I did reserve the first Strat Live orb for the tank; but no orbs dropped in the run. I gave him 15g instead out of the goodness of my heart, as I know he doesn't need anything from that instance.
---
Death ray, shrink ray, mind control cap. IMO gnomish has a lot of BoP that you can keep and reroll goblin when you have the money to pick up the rest, which is the most optimal way of doing it strictly speaking.
---
For me the main thing gnomish is missing is the rocket helmet. The only other thing goblin really has is grenades that you can buy as gnomish, and gnomish teleport is infinitely more valuable for alliance and will be even more so closer to AQ probably late next year so it really isn't worth rerolling goblin for me. If the goblin explosives get too pricy compared to their mats I will have a twink that can eventually make them.
---
I alone have 5 days from standing around afk while que dodging
---
Subscriber count for a subreddit is an awful statistic to use. 
---
Mods can see daily activity and I guarantee it’s way down. Just look at the posts/comments per day, that huge drop off. 
---
The population has absolutely dwindled, but like you said it’ll come in spikes (BG release will be huge)
---
The bag problem! It's so real. The two characters I play most often in classic are Hunter and Warlock. I actually just started using regular bags for my ammo and soup shards, so as I use them up I also get a bag space back. But dang, I feel like I either have to run to a vendor or destroy grey items twice as often as my husband, who I'm always playing with.
---
Much appreciated! Iirc its tidy plates that has that interface
---
I don't usually see this many people in IF. 
---
So many mounts
---
And where the shit are you getting this information? Any logs don’t reflect this. It’s dominated by warriors primarily with mages and rogues having a good showing.
---
Just because a shadow priest can multidot in UBRS and come out top on meters doesn’t mean much. Some classes can’t deal damage to an entire pack. And that’s mainly just trash packs. A priest is generally going to get absolutely shit on when it comes to the bosses.
---
Shadow priest just doesn’t have the longevity, nor do they have any sort of cooldown to bump their dps. Are they *bad* in their own right? Not at all. But ***compared to others*** they aren’t exactly good, and the more effort to even be comparable.
---
Your just reiterating the question I've posed multiple times now without answering it.
---
Why is you getting your gear right now more important than someone else in your party getting their gear in an hour?
---
Everyone just keeps saying that it is without providing a justification as if it's self evident, when the entire problem is that it's not.
---
As many as possible, warlocks still go oom, nevermind shadow priests.
---
As a male troll hunter the only thing o don’t like I helmet and it’s ONLY certain styles...just keep playing it! The helm styles will change and look better. But remember our tusks will Always stock through
---
Did Strat and tank said they only did it for the rep pretty much. I didn't care much that they needed the scourgestones.
---
We ended up doing a scholomance afterwards and they didn't need the scourgestones in there for some reason. Maybe started to like the group too much to steal all the stones :P
---
Oh it's definitely cos of the if I heal them before I drink then they run in problem, hell some even run in when I don't heal them before drinking
---
I did my first MC raid the other day as Shadow Priest, was in the top 5 damage for most of the fights and the Warlocks seemed happy with Shadow Weaving.
---
It's really not that bad as long as you are keeping supplied on Major Mana Potions and Dark/Demonic Runes.
---
And Shadow is arguably one of the best (if not the best) PvP specs in the game.
---
Never had any issues getting into dungeons either.
---
Most of the Shadow criticism I've seen comes from Mages and Hunters who are bored to death of their one button class and wish they could be playing something else.
---
Yeye keep social engineering people cuz youre thin skinned bitch; u can just ignore them; u dont need “ higher power” to do shit for u; how do u even survive in real life?
---
After you kill the king, but before becoming king yourself, all mobs are red but not hostile.
---
This list is definitely missing some spawns.
---
There is at least one other down in DM:E lashers area. Its on the side opposite of the one you posted. Follow the wall down from the satyr entrance, and right where you see 2 pods, often times a dreamfoil, and further out a pack of lashers, you'll see a book spawn (rarely, of course).
---
Population already dropped off by WAY more than half in 2 months, just give it another. Watch all the casuals on pvp servers quit during P2 when they can't get anything done in the 2h a day they play as well. 
---
P2 is going to look like the sharpest peak/drop off in the history of gaming.
---
I agree that the Blizzard raid frames are really nice but they are still inferior to Grid2 since it's so customizable.
---
You failed to support your point in this long-ass argument. You do, however look like an angry baby arguing with its parents. Don’t reply to me again. You don’t know how to have 2-way discussions and I’m not here to be your therapist and explain things to you. Let’s save that chore for a professional.
---
No.  I started doing the same thing while leveling my current rogue...but I leveled probably 5 other chars in vanilla and tbc and didn’t realize it :p
---
Idk classic dungeons are easy enough where you can usually drag a fifth person through but I’m having a hard time holding my tongue through three hour BRD sessions where one of our dps slots is being outmatched by a healer tossing out occasional SWP’s
---
The irony of WF is that a warrior with a slow 2H will proc WF more often than a shaman. Additionally, the warrior will scale with it.
---
Warrior: Warrior spams instant attacks. Warrior procs WF more. WF feeds warrior more rage. Warrior spams more attacks.
---
Shaman: Shaman auto attacks and prays for procs. Shaman continues autoing. Oh, there goes a proc. It didn't crit. They didn't get additional future damage for it. Target gets healed to full with no mortal strike since the RNG didn't lineup.
---
Not sure this fits but took this just after i got my raptor 4 days ago :) [https://imgur.com/sI1BdLs](https://imgur.com/sI1BdLs)
---
Hey dude I'm on bloodfang EU, 60 resto shaman. Allways nice to have a friendly tank, hit me up 'sandoval' is my character
---
Im of the exact opposite opinion. Crosszone quests ftw. Its what make classic feels liek an adventure. In tbc and onward the questing is too much of an on-rails experience imo.
---
Do you have a level 60 and have cleared MC a couple times and aren't find yourself playing less?
---
Fury? Why fury?
---
My guild is stark opposite.
---
Miss in white attacks will still happen 
---
BT WW HS when used won’t
---
Change your strat for Ony and you'll never have threat issues.
---
It's funny when sometimes you see a bunch of ppl in IF and then switch to another layer and suddenly it's almost empty. Not common but it happens.
---
That 9% is for your main hand yellow hits. White hits can still miss, off hand miss chance is even higher.
---
I am new and inexperienced, especially with dungeons, but I'm not understanding what is so difficult to grasp.
---
1. Tank sets pace and pulls aggro
---
2. DPS do DPS things
---
3. Healer heals
---
4. ???
---
5. No wipe
---
i remember when vanilla wow came out with the reputation that it was a casual friendly mmo lol
---
They all greeded and you gave them your bis? lol
---
Grinding mobs in the open world can be one of the most relaxing and non-stress activities you can do. Put on some good music, or maybe a podast or netflix and go ham. You barely need to pay attention.
---
God damn your life is flimsy.
---
Yeesh. Thats gross.
---
Do you play the game „alone“ or with people from your RL social circle? All my friends stopped playing and now I‘m losing interest
---
It's time to go from #1 on dmg to #1 stage 2.
---
That's happened to me during wod playing Disc, so strong.
---
I hope TBC doesn't come.
---
It'd nullify vanilla character progress through gear and profession redundancy.
---
TBC was a socially a very dark time for me, so I don't want to dwell there.
---
Chipotle was one of my favorite things in the US.
---
Warrior = Miss, Miss, Parry, Dodge, Miss, Dodge, Parry, Dodge, Block, Miss, Hit for 77 on a 500ap weapon, Miss, Miss, Miss, Overpower Missed   
---
URGH!!!!
---
There’s probably already a spreadsheet available.
---
Uhm... how about you break Line of Sight and let the casters come to you, so you can tank them rather than giving them free hits on your healer?
---
 Most important things:  
---
1) Set marks
---
2) Know what you need to tank (usually a taunt on the skull mark is enough to not worry about it)
---
3) Break line of sight so you don't have untanked range mobs attacking your healer
---
If your intention is to AOE grind mobs, hunter isn't really made for that.  Volley has a 1 minute cooldown and isn't great.  Multishot has something like an 8 second CD so it's not spammable.  With the right pet, you can pull a pack of 3 mobs and focus them down one at a time, but you're going to need to heal your pet and mana up between pulls.  
---
The best AOE tanking pets are owls, vultures, and gorillas.  However, if you get more than 1 multi shot off during a 2 or 3 mob group, you're going to pull agro and have to FD.  It all sounds fine on paper, but you're going to be drinking and healing your pet between each pull.  I think you're going to come to realize it's more efficient to learn how to chain kill mobs.
---
So, the classic community accepts reserve runs (source: your server LFG channel) and you don't. 
---
The things balance itself out: while it's equally easier to get gear for people in retail, for classic it's easier for tanks (or social players with tank friends or players brazen enough to build their own group with reserved items WITHOUT a tank even) and harder for DPS which again, balances itself since demand for tanks significantly exceeds their supply.
---
The lack of quality of life updates like double-spec etc. only emphasizes the lack of tanks issue. 
---
Unless you make people stop joining runs with loot reserved by tanks or their friends, you won't stop tanks or their friends reserving loot for themselves, that's quite obvious.
---
Is there a 100% confirmed answer as to whether Steam Link and WoW are allowed?
---
Be that within a house, or remotely (i.e. from work during my break)
---
Wand spec, spirit tap, then 5% holy crit and -0.5 sec on Smite and HF casting time. It's more DPS than pure shadow pre-SF and you get your AoE by lvl 30. I have also taken Healing Focus and Improved Renew, meaning that healing up while mobs are wailing on me is easy, and I've managed to do some group/elite content solo.
---
Technically sure, you don't even have to play at all. But the advantage you get from spending time in classic is insane. Want good PVP rank? Prepare to grind for months non stop. Want to progress in PVE? Prepare to grind all week to afford consumables for the next raid.
---
30 to 40 2as the worst (if you don't spamm scarlet)
---
40 to 50  has great areas with decent questsike tanaris
---
And zf
---
What's a reasonable price for a summon?
---
I love to fish in WOW, it realxes me but also brings a bit of money. Of course the best way is to fish in a fishing spot. 
---
Do you know a map of WOW where i can see all the fishing spots?
---
Make it usable with auctioneer, tsm, etc and this will be huge
---
As a tank that leads groups, follow the tank step by step is my advice.
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/statistics/1000
---
I believe Incendius or Grobbulous (sp) are some of the better balanced PvP/RP-PvP servers.
---
The chances on hit would stack, not cancel each other out.
---
Imagine paying for Game, monthly subscription. That alone should be enough payment to have a microtransaction free game. Yet more wants more. And we ended up here. I just payed for my 3rd subs to play classic. And i'm still thinking about the game every second, i'm not playing it. I'm having such a blast. This isnt just nolstalgia. This is pure love for a 15 year old game, that still to this day manage to bring such an entertainment. As long is we keep this version of the game. I don't see any reason to play anything else in a long period of time, if not forever.
---
We still have ques during primetime on herod.
---
This is indicated by "Resisted" text appearing on your screen. I'm a hunter who has been targeted by fireballs after using FD.
---
That's a minority. I don't know anyone in-game who stopped playing because of it.
---
Just keep questing. Doing dungeons when you have all the dungeon quest as well.
---
 Here you go.. did something with the old reborn ui textures  i use discord unitframes , discord art, bartender, sexy minimap, details!, classic threatmeter, bagnon, gathermate2, item dispenser, titanpanel  &gt;&gt; https://imgur.com/a/n0qKx6z &lt;&lt;
---
Great work!
---
Warriors are extremely strong right now, too. Only marginally getting beat by rogues.
---
So tanks over value themselves? Because trade is FULL of groups just searching for tanks. The majority of my time in groups is spent looking for a tank.
---
Tanks are 100% the bottleneck for 5mans.
---
9% for yellow main hand, 11% white main hand and correct me if I'm wrong 16%? white off hand
---
Most epics you get from raids will be mitigation gear except for maybe 1 or 2 piecies or your guild dps will get mad. And you don't want to wear mitigation gear in 5mans coz you will starve on rage. So actually full blue gear that is build around threat and not mitigation(or even better - around reflecting dmg for sweet chain pulls at certain instance spots) will be better and provide smoother experience for the group.
---
I am using Zygor also. It's pretty cool, saves a lot of alt tabing to wowhead. It has a lot of zones switching but it's done like this in order to do only quests that are yellow/green for you. If you add a dungeon run from time to time, you do only green quests which makes it pretty easy.
---
I mean, your actions have consequences. It's almost like this is community and social interaction driven game.
---
You can't get away with being dick forever.
---
Tank for people and dungeon grind
---
you really .,.. really need first aid ... its really useful and a way to heal without mana
---
that sounds perfect, is questie bad or something though? Why do you hate it?
---
Jesus yeah, anyone who has tried this pull on Classic knows they hit waaaay more. Monks in there do 100+ per melee, and sometimes they charge up 5-6 hits in a row which one shots you.
---
Offtopic, but WotLK DK was an absolute masterpiece in terms of it's talent tree design. How all 3 specs could do both roles was fantastic.
---
It’s still way easier than it was back in the days. Like I said, most of Classic difficulty is the preparation, not the boss fights. Later raids will need more preparation, people with specific gear, for example.
---
But the fights themselves are not mechanically difficult by today’s standards.
---
We are talking about 12 hours a day for 2 months or more. Also Netflix or even doing sports this much intense is more about the thing itself and not about a relationship.
---
Also please stop ganking me in AV I just wanna level up lmao.
---
Actions have consequences.
---
Alpha Warriors tank raids
---
I don't think your formula is what's being used by the game
---
it's ridiculous. Now I have to cast another heal or two and now you have to wait even longer for my many to regen.
---
I wouldnt diminish the efforts  of tanks. Tanking is an art in vanilla, and there are good tanks and very bad tanks. Half of it is knowing how to pull safely and check for pats. People are so used to retail where every pull is just an aoe grind and nothing matters. In classic, if you pull 5 mobs without cc, you're probably going to have a bad time.
---
Sometimes it’s what makes the character! I’m a hunter so troll make is for me what you are explaining female is for you
---
Main reason I never want to group up with people when questing on a priest. No one knows about spirit tap. And even if you tell them, they don't care.
---
Probably consumables, down ranking, gearing a little more MP5 than you'd expect, etc.
---
Really consider switching to ElvUI, you can change basically everything.
---
You can also create custom text fields with value from variables like your life or mana, meaning that with ElvUI you can do what you asked.
---
In ElvUI you can also disable buffs/debuffs from the player portrait.
---
i would recommend you get your weapon skill to 290+ before the raid starts ... 300 be better as the bosses are 63
---
I think the mainhand has 9% miss chance but the offhand has 23% as far as I know.
---
You should google heroic strike queuing.

Well my guess is p2 will be short, the general players are going to hate the honor farming that takes place. The camping and shit will punish anyone not geared, not in a big guild, not leveled up ect. All these players will just end up quitting if they can't progress, it's the last thing Blizz will want so they'll push p3 with the Bgs to focus the honor farming out of the open world into Bgs.
---
Congrats. It’s a great feeling. My luckiest night happened a few weeks ago. My first MC raid I got two tier pieces and followed it up with an LBRS run where I got 2 BoE epics. Felt good man.
---
Post logs please.
---
lmaooo I usually leave people alone unless they attack me.
---
I would have tried a GM ticket in that case. If both the guy winning it and you confirm loot distribution went wrong (and you were both allowed to roll), I guess there is a good chance they could fix it. Just pay the guy who won some gold.
---
Git gud scrub
---
Benik needs to be integrated into Elv itself.
---
Why do you grind if the reward at the end isn't appealing? Applies to all types of grind in classic.
---
I never grind mobs as I am healer and instead I go dungeons! I meet a bunch of people, I practice explaining like my group is 5 yo, sometimes I get gear or quests or whatever. Game's boring on your own, and grinding solo is probably the top most boring thing to do. So why do it?
---
I knew a guy who said it was going to be dead the first week. Imagine having that level of delusion for a game you don't like.
---
But warriors use leather
---
And farming the whole instance tomes with a range of price going from 5g to 1500. Cut the bullshit, rogue is easy life.
---
Rattlegore
---
Well ele is better for leveling 40+ so at that point you can pretty much keep the same gear. I have a few extra +healing pieces just in case.
---
No kidding. Was in a quick match where the only person talking was a Mercy who was complaining about how shitty we were and how he was getting all these kills over us. Like yeah, that’s great you can get kills. Good thing you are supposed to be HEALING US.
---
Also, I am main heals in WoW Classic as a priest. Admittedly challenging as shadow spec, and finally switched to holy at 58. The only times I’ve ever attempted to DPS is when I am fully confident I’m not going to run OOM before the mobs die. 
---
Why a healer would feel like being ballsy like that on such a long dungeon beats me. Sorry to hear about your pains. I apologize a lot of I even let a dps die because I replay what I could do differently. Usually it’s wrongly anticipating the incoming burst damage, having unnecessary heals queued up while the mage gets nuked when AoE’ing and needing bubble (same with lock). 
---
Chalk it up for bad luck with teammates. Next time will be better.
---
To clarify, your character has to be level 5 to learn a profession.  Once you learn enchanting, that character can disenchant anything.
---
Bingo. People recognize my priest named Pisslips all the time.
---
I don't see how it breaks their t's and c's?
---
As an orc, you have +5 skill to axes.  That's about +3 hit % that you don't need to worry about.  Please read the entire section on weapon skill here:

---
Well I mean if it’s a pack of 6 elites it’s 6x SwP (that you can downrank for efficiency) and a few mindflays.
---
You should still be able to raid even if you don´t have the pre-bis. For the dungeons I would recommend to make a group (5-8 people with the same free time slots available) with your guild, define some item goals for that group together and then run dungeons on off-raid days until everybody got his items. Worked for me.
---
People nut off on being contrarian on the internet

Chipotle is fucking great, hence you'll see a ton of edgelords talking shit on the internet

ExorsusRaidTools
---
In other words: don't have fun now because those specs will be less good in two years!!!!!
---
Doesn't matter how optimal it is, no one wants to give damage gear to priests, which is why people run a healer with shadow weaving instead.
---
Man I got ganked 7 times in AV last night, and I couldent do anything about it each time. XD
---
Sure in solo play, but in solo play if you pull extra aggro that's only you it hurts. In a group, if you pull extra aggro, you could wipe the entire group.
---
You're free to make your own group, with every combination you like, just like you're free to reserve items. I just think people reserving items are losers. People are always going to need something, it's the entire reason behind doing dungeons at max level. It's very rare that only a single person needs something.
---
after lvl 60 and after some gear, the warriors becomes a farming god. until then, that sucks
---
Just wanted to make sure. Not that you torture yourself through that =)
---
But yeah, as Resto Druid you shouldn't have much trouble to find a Raid spot in the end game. Mark of the Wild, Innervate and Rebirth alone are very useful spells for any raid. And you're healing isn't that much worse than Priest or Pala.
---
Why did you remove it?
---
Avg strat live run is like 1h if you include traveling, maybe some random wipe or afk. One orb is what - 20-25g? Now add in downtime, because you are not solo - people leave, need repairs etc. Now how much gold/h you think a tank reserving 1 orb per run would make? Compare it to any dps solofarming ZF / BRD / any of DM wings? That's the reason why most tanks will rather do something else than go Strat Live for less than 25g.

aha @tidy check me out

Leave the anxiety about endgame and the feeling that you're constantly falling behind the curve to Retail and just enjoy Classic. Leveling is a huge part of the overall experience, and the endgame honestly sucks so why hurry?
---
My Voidwalker and pulling 3 extra enemies
---
&gt; Tbf most wipes are caused by hunters/mages pulling because ‘we got to keep the pace up’
---
&gt; You pull it, you tank it!
---
lol had a hunter doing this in DM West last night,, we had a paly tank so it was a bit slower cause of drinking. hunter didn't like this and started pulling the big tree dudes at the start, tank tanked the first one. he did it again and the tank just walked backwards into the wall and watched the hunter get smashed as his feign didn't work and then said "you gonna let me pull now?"
---
run went fine after that
---
Because they're the highest DPS spec in the game.
---
Did I gank you!? :D
---
Nightfall and Annihilator swapping with totem twisting. I've heard it's valuable to have one in raid, but no more than that.
---
It's not at all rare if you don't want it to be.
---
If you want HoJ, you throw on a shield and you tank for a group of clothes or do a guild run. That way the loot is split. Having one group of 5 clotgies and one group of 5 melee dps is ridiculous, you're getting maybe 1/3rd of the loot per person and disenchanting the rest. It seems like your way only benefits classes who want the loot but don't want to put in time to form a group with a good composition. But sure, invite 3 rogues and a fury warrior off tank if you want, but I don't think it makes anyone a loser for wanting to avoid that group.
---
People will be running MC until the end of time, don't worry. You've still got time before the honor system launch but I'd make sure you're 60 before then.
---
&gt; I play two characters 
---
Suggest you stop playing the second if you're that concerned about "missing out".
---
Welcome to av haha
---
Anyone else noticed that PvP against higher levels seems really bugged? I was helping my friend in stv last night who was getting camped by a lvl 40 warlock and rogue. I'm a 60 orc hunter. They were able to keep me stunlocked and feared the entire time. They even landed fear on my 60 pet with some training in shadow resistance for 60 resistance. I looked at my combat log and the warlock did not get a single spell resist, and the rogue did not get a single stun resist. Out of the rogue's 15 attacks, 9 of them crit me and only one auto missed. This is now how I remember it being in vanilla. I remember landing a sap on higher levels every now and then but landing spells consistently was very rare
---
In stv/feralas/tanaris: eels, oilies, trunk items (big money in trunks). In azshara, squid, mightfish, eels, and patches of elemental water. The patches are the top spot if you find them.
---
There’s also +shadow dmg gear. If you don’t have a lock in the group let ppl know you’re needing on that stuff to make a shadow set. If there is a lock in group work it out with him beforehand. If he needs an item for main spec then you should pass for off spec.  If he passes for main spec then you can need for off spec. 
---
But again, discuss with group beforehand.
---
I’ve been playing a tad less but it’s not because I don’t want to. Just getting to be that busy family time of year. I want to play believe me. Need to farm my epic mount, and get my quest log completed out. Want to take PTO but only have a few days left for this year. MUST PLAY MOAR.
---
OK ?
---
Anyone can confirm this? I don't want to buy the shield as it will break sheep in dungeon but if it doesnt proc...
---
Haha ty
---
It doesn't really matter who your searching for if the item is unrelated to that role.
---
Is a healer going to care that a melee dps trinket is on reserve?
---
For warrior what level is it worth switching from arms to fury?  Or is it a matter of level and gear?
---
Geil!
---
I get that most gaming is part of cycles, cod, fortnite, BF etc.
---
But I don't believe this entirely applies to MMORPGs.
---
If you are a longtime wow player, there is no end. Got all your prebis and can only get upgrades from MC\Ony? Level a new character, grind more gold, get that epic mount, level professions.
---
It just never ends, and I don't want it to either. For me the fact that there will be 6 phases of this stuff just fuels me to do even more stuff in wow, like leveling multiple characters etc.
---
In no way shape or form does the fact that my "main" is fully decked out and can only get upgrades once or twice a week during raids, made me play any less.
---
I should also add that I'm a longtime gamer, have been playing games since I was old enough to sit upright. During classics release I played WAY MORE than I usually do, pretty much every waking hour I wasn't at work. So I do play less then I did during launch, but during launch I played an ungodly amount. But, now I can sit back, relax, raid twice per week and level my two alts at the pace I desire.
---
I don't know, this is my personal experience at least. I know many who got burnt out and quit before they hit 60, but those are your typical "your game needs to adapt to my needs" rather then "I need to adapt to this games needs" type of people.
---
Ty!
---
Everyone's shitting on you but you got it right. If the spriest wants shadow gear, he can heal for it. There is no such thing as a dps priest/shaman/paladin/druid/warrior in classic. You play a class, not a role. And if you can't play all the roles associated with your class, you're bad.
---
Their DPS is totally respectable for the 60 seconds or so they have mana.
---
Do you play 13 hours a day?
---
Is it worth enchanting Thrash Blade with fiery weapon for a 48 rogue?
---
After 20 years playing MMO RPG's I don't even watch my xp bar anymore.
---
Just have to know when I have to come back to town to learn some skills, that's the only time I watch it. It is hidden otherwise. I put rep bar instead since there's so many that I like to track which one is the priority.
---
I tried everything though, even been addicted to Titan Panel level up time calculus and wouldn't log off before dinging. But eventually you realize later than logging on to level up 10 minutes after is a very satisfying feeling, more than going to bed hyper tired cause you pushed too much.
---
It's about people behaviour I guess.
---
its the sound of....bells being thrown into a dumpster
---
When did they revert? I quit using it a few weeks ago because of how bad it was.
---
Woot! Gratz on the ding!
---
Ty I will. I have used several addons to get what I have now. ElvUI... is it like all in one kinda thing?
---
because of your OffHand.  
---
i think the hit cap is somewhere between 22 and 24% if im not mistaking, and even then,, you'll still miss every now and then with your off hand.
---
Ive done this before in the past with a mara leather head piece. I saw the stats and the sprite which looks a lot like the SM CAT head piece and it had high int and i needed on it infront of a druid healer as a mage and i won i felt miserable after it.
---
Some guilds request raiders level a lock to 20 for soulstones. Seems ridiculous but it really does help with progression through gear check bosses.
---
I have a level 20 druid, is it worth levelling that as a tank, or re-rolling a warrior?
---
I charge between 15-30g depending on what dungeon it is, for my tanking.
---
The way I see it; I can't farm for shit, this is my way of making gold &amp; not just wasting my time.
---
I get that but when the mats are core leather, fiery cores and lava cores you won’t be soloing that for an hour or two.
---
Aaaaaaaand then you flip out over things like Maiden's Circle.
---
Even greens are money towards your goal, just because the amount per unit is smaller doesn't mean you should treat it differently than the jackpot drops.
---
There's a fishing guide on classic wowhead, I think the schools are random spawns within set areas.
---
thiccc
---
Amen dude amen. And whenever you preach anything close to performance analysis or logs, they say “I PLAY FOR FUN”. Well, nobody likes wiping over and over cus your Dunham’s wants to do 100 dps in epics.
---
I did have ElvUI set up at one point.
---
Then I got a new PC, lost all my mod settings and went back to TukUI.
---
I could never get ElvUI to be quite as nice as TukUI but I guess that's the price for more customisability. Maybe I'll give it another shot sometime.
---
Was thinking the exact same thing. everybody to follow the person in front on him, and the guy in front hooks up to the last guy of the chain.
---
You're not paying the tank to run BRD, you're paying him to join a pug over a group of people they already know.
---
&gt; Yeah first orb or "tank tax" 
---
there was a group looking for DPS for strat with orbs reserved on my server yesterday, people were making fun of them posting messages like "orbs not reserved and such" i did DM west and came back, dude was still looking for DPS orbs reserved....
---
‘’good’’ pressing 2 buttons lol
---
I play on the old blanchy server. Once I get enough money I'll send him letter. Thanks for the advice
---
Brown-skinned Orc Warlock named "Asaplocky" checking in
---
What are you killing
---
I was confused too, but I believe they meant 3 consecutive healers over the 3 hours. 1 left, 1 was kicked, and the other messed up.
---
In endgame, Fury is PvE and arms is PvP.
---
I tried Zygor and while the addon itself was clean, the routing was absolutely awful. A poster below claims they've reverted it to original Vanilla now so maybe it's better.
---
Trying out Joana currently and even though you have to have it open in a browser it seems *way* better.
---
No, there will always be people who play 20 hours a day for years straight. That's their prerogative, I can't compete with them nor should I.
---
it is a little hard to feel sympathy for people who picked meme specs and are now being forced to switch.  you were told ahead of time what spec you would need to play and you still went ahead with it...
---
Smeggy?
---
whats the difference between jumper cables and the XL jumper cables?

P99 green launches 10/25

Yes, but when you invest some time to configure it or use configs of other users you will be pleased.
---
Azuregos for example has a respawn timer that is random between a number of days (I think?) so every day someone has to be around. We did it on nostalrius when he was released, and managed to be there first with these tactics. If I remember correctly we wiped first time and then second try there was over 3 horde guilds arriving to kill us and take the kill.
---
I don't mind these Casino things, but dislike those who do it to scam people. (long rant ahead, ignore me)
---
I remember I played Alliance on a new server on Retail a couple years ago - ran into a guy advertising his "Casino" in chat. You'd have about 5+ people who would ALWAYS win. Those people seemed to only ever log on after the other had already logged off. About 1 in every 100 people would actually win anything, even if they did win, they didn't always get their winnings. I tried to report him, but nothing ever came from it either despite the numerous amount of people who reported him.
---
He later stopped running the Casino when another guy caught onto his scam and started his own "Casino", he eventually switched to another server after amassing a few million gold from gullible people, some of whom I was in a Guild with and one happened to be the GM of the Guild I was in. He lost about 500k to the guy saying he was just having "bad luck" because he "won" 30k earlier. 
---
Oh and if you want to know how I knew it was his own characters he was using to trick people into using his "Casino", he ended up fessing up to it later on down the road by accidentally having ALL of his accounts whisper me in an attempt to have me put him on ignore, he didn't realize he had set it to all accounts in the program. So while he whispered me, his other accounts said it in /say which was quite hilarious because he quickly logged off for a few days then came back on with new names for ALL of his characters. He'd pretend that his alts had "lost" by trying to act like he wasn't the one using the Casino character, so he set the Casino character on auto talk while he used his other account to say "oh darn I can't believe I lost" or something like that just to make it look real. It was funny at first, but then I had friends and Guild mates, as well as seeing the low level newbs who were just starting WoW out for the first time, losing everything they have to this guy - it irked me. I tried to steer people away but it never worked, he made millions of gold, transferred servers and was never seen again. He's likely still doing it to this day.
---
&gt; I don't know anyone in-game who stopped playing 
---
well.... yeah.
---
I guess they would. Damn locks...
---
litterly shit myself last time i ate that garbage 
---
don’t eat at chain restaurant 
---
support local business and don’t shit your pants
---
I'd stick to arms while overworld leveling, but if you want to switch, after Maraudon is a good time, using vanquisher + thresh blade
---
Tanks are the new celebrities, everyone is using you and you’ll never find your true friends!
---
I think it's my server. Horde outnumber us (it seems like, I don't have actual stats) and are so hostile. So zones like Tanaris and lower STV are dangerous. I'm usually LFG or mindlessly grinding some mobs in the badlands. but I did run ZF a couple times last night and boy that is some nice xp
---
Classic is great , just worried about retail I haven’t been back since the launch of classic I don’t want to get left behind in retail .
---
I'd compare tanking to trying to heard a bunch of children with the temperament of feral kittens. It's great as long as you don't get stressed out over constantly losing threat and chasing mobs all over the instance as your party members run around like headless chickens. Also keep in mind that in most dungeons you're expected to take charge and guide the party and do all the pulling etc (parties where this is not the case usually means someone else is doing the pulling which is a freaking miserable experience).
---
So ya, I'd definitely recommend giving it a shot, as a bonus you will have a really easy time finding groups.
---
Well a lot of guilds that do this are a few weeks from being ready to do a pure guild run, waiting on levelers or still recruiting. Going with 30 guild + 10 pugs is a pretty good way to pick up a few new guys.
---
There’s a difference between “use” and “sell” here that you can’t comprehend. Treat it like any die roll, if it’s an upgrade you won the initial die roll. Anyone who needs it rolls again for it. Need before greed, it’s been this way for years. 
---
Most of the items in older MMO’s were “BoE”, this is how it operates. No one went rolling on items to sell if someone could use it. Quit acting like some entitled kid and get with the program.
---
so it's perfectly normal to see " miss " pop up with my gear and hit %? i thought i was bugged lol
---
Maybe I should switch servers, I play on a German server and people just play within their guild or with the people they know
---
5593 4700 without buffs?
---
Some bs somebody said indeed. Somebody who tested it since 2004.
---
As opposed to bs that somebody thought would be the formula without any insider knowledge or testing of their own.
---
Every +5 weapon skill will increase your chance to hit opponent by 3%, so +15 will make it additional 9%. It also increases your chance to crit them as well. There is a hit cap for a reason. So you will miss occasional strike even on a character with 100 less defense than your weapon skill.
---
Yes, I do go by second hand information here.
---
I don't know the situation of this story, but a very popular spec for druids is down to Heart of the Wild in feral and then Nature's Swiftness in resto. It allows you to both heal, tank, or dps. Heart of the Wild gives you 20% increased Int. I don't need to tell you have insane that is for healing. 
---
That said, I would never consider switching to cat to dps while healing during a dungeon. It costs WAY too much mana to switch forms.
---
I know there's players like you and me who will play long term, but the cycle applies to everything now. You can literally watch it happen on twitch with every new release, wow classic included. We might see small spikes on content patches but it's all downhill from now, and thankfully we're starting from a fairly high hill.
---
Guys, it's ok to bail on a group when you wipe 6 times in a row. That shouldnt be happening.
---
My English is not the yellow of the egg, it is very hard to stop using German speakwords and it makes me fox-devils-wild
---
Agree anyone who says 'Most people' are just spewing BS. We know numbers wise TBC was popular and there are certainly a number of us playing classic in hope of getting TBC or WotLK. It's the easy, lower cost route to go. 
---
The fact is once Nax is done and people are bored Blizz will have to do something to try to retain these subs. Their pipedream would be push us all to retail but that is just a bastardized version of the once great game. From a business prospective TBC makes the most sense, it costs the least to produce and will keep some of those that would stop playing. Not all servers would be TBC it makes the most sense to allow those that want to move on to do so and those that want to stay on classic to stay put.
---
Nice man. Yeah it really is, gonna run on this high for a while :)
---
This particular market is fickle, the smallest margin I've ever sold for was 5g.  The largest was probably about 12g.  Most people shy away from the arcanite transmute market because tying up 40g in an arcane crystal every 2 days sucks.
---
+1 for switching to ElvUI, but I'll add a recommendation for using Luckyones' profile.
---
*56 but yeah thanks! I'd like to thank the Scarlet Crusade, Auctioneer Thathung and the fine folks at Marshall's Point in Un'Goro Crater.
---
You're right, my bad. However, ElvUI does change the chat class colors. Not entirely sure why you're having the pink for Shaman as I don't have that issue on my account. You can always one of those addons that changes Shamans names to blue.
---
You’re getting very punished for using any leather items. Especially the last boss hurts in his wolf form.
---
Can you share the warriors gear? I tried doing this run with a priest friend, we both have pre-raid BIS gear but I get absolutely shit on by the bosses, even in full plate gear.
---
Because it was 
---
Think about the MMO landscape in 2004. WoW was so casual you could literally solo and level and progress. That's how casual it was. That's insane, in retrospect
---
Wut. Between using correct curses, DOTs, pet management, balancing hp/mana with life tap, keeping up with shards for soul/healthstones,  and AOE correctly there's plenty to be mindful of. Spamming shadowbolt is a good way to steal aggro from the tank.
---
The XL cables have about 2-3x the chance to actually work.
---
&gt; There has already been quite a drop off 
---
Duh, we knew this would happen. Because there would be a surge of people who never played classic, but wanted to "see what it's like".
---
And when they realized what it was, they went back to retail. Classic isn't for everyone, just like retail isn't for me.
---
I PERSONALLY love druid tanks, and I haven‘t had a bad experience with the 7-8 druid tanks I had until 60. BUT you may encounter people who are tryhard dicks about the main tank being a druid at lvl 60. Regardless, during the lvl process, people will grab anyone who is willing to be the meatshield in a dungeon. 
---
There are also speedlvling-guids, in case you decide to roll a warrior you‘re lvl 20 within a day. It‘s really up to you :)
---
Your answer made me realise that I should have asked; "how do I keep things interesting without killing the group?" /smile
---
You can watch ahmpys stream, hes currently struggling live :P
---
My number 1 tip for making money in wow is to find something really profitable and then make sure to tell **absolutely no one** about said strategy ;)
---
Agreed.  Get 1 to 60, join some pug for mc/ony.  1 shot all of it and then you will realize that end game isnt even out yet.
---
Once again the old Blizzard adage is relevant:
---
Exploit early, exploit often.
---
Before DM dropped, Second Wind was BiS for Shadow Priests as well, simply for the on use mana regen.
---
Sometimes, if you want to be salty about gear, you should do the googles.
---
Not directed at you, just folks in general.
---
2 seconds would be extremely slow to press esc.
---
As a tank I'm so sick of people leaving after 1 or 2 wipes, this isn't retail and wipes happen. Now what I do in BRD is purposely wipe 2 times in the first 5 packs to gague the type of party it is, if it's an understanding party they will stay if you apologise and if it's full of elitists they will just leave.
---
People may disagree with my approach, but doing this has helped me weed out some right nobs and find some really nice people.
---
Might have been his next run. One of the tanks in my guild does full orb+flask pattern+robe pattern res runs with a healer and splits the profits. They're making decent gold, not sure they're even beating DM:E jump runs.
---
Yeah same here. I think my chat has them as blue now. But my target portrait class color still shows them as pink.
---
I've seen people put crusader on it, yeah it will last you until raids if you don't bother to farm dal'rends.
---
How is that not similar? It's the exact same thing, you just don't value other people's time but think they should just give it to you for free?
---
More like 6months
---
What level should I upgrade to artisan skinning?
---
People are only downvoting this because they're jealous.
---
Either way it’s a wipe.
---
regardless, that's 6 months of using a bow
---
This. Elemental Mastery is amazing while leveling. Lightning Bolt &gt; Elemental Mastery &gt; Chain Lightning then before it goes off spam &gt; Earth Shock so Elemental Mastery is used twice. Works cuz of spell batching. Both will use no Mana and both will crit.
---
So we finally found the one raid boss that a prot paladin can tank better than any other tanking class! :D
---
After reading this.... I feel like I live up to my Female Human Shadowpriest.
---
Says the person using an example that is obviously flawed, and basic math shows it. Still proceeds to call other people a kid though. Projection anyone?
---
If you can make raids consistently there will always be space, don’t feel discouraged about applying to any guild, even the top top guilds need people for 2nd, or 3rd raids.
---
There are 6 fury warriors and an off tank or two who want two handers. They all want 2H off of rag or nef. Each 2H is 5% or less drop chance. My guild hasn't seen spinal reaper or BRE drop yet and we cleared MC since week two of launch. Probability states it will take 120 weeks to get everyone ashkandi give or take.
---
Ashkandi won't be on every warrior in my guild. If you had a hypothetical situation where every warrior had ashkandi, sure. Give it to the meme spec.
---
Also, its not just a meme pvp weapon. I have done 1200 dps (1400 dps before aggro pull due to tank MC) on a boss fight with dreadforge retaliator which has 50 dps. Imagine what would happen with a twohander with 80 dps? [log](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/D8Yg3jQF9ZhwmLnC#fight=10) And that was weeks ago. Imagine full epics? Respectfully, a shaman/pally will not maximize what that mace could do.

There are classes that can pull the whole cathedral and live, but it's not trivial is the point. If the entire cathedral was spell casters it'd be trivial, as you would resist mostly everything.
---
Druids are great 5-man dungeon tanks but are not as often used as raid tanks, so it really depends on what your end game goals become.  I would say go with the druid and learn to tank with that tool set in 5-mans.  Nice thing about druid is that if you want to try healing, that's totally within your ability as well.  I have a druid stuck at level 21 though, so I know it's a bit of a slog, but my understanding is that druid leveling becomes a lot more fluid in the upper 20s.

/r/titlegore

Hey, lots of true statements here, id like to respond to some of the claims though of thats okay.  
---
 When he makes the first pet pull and runs up the ramp there could be an Ogre elite on the bottom of the ramp, there could be an Ogre elite on the top of the ramp, there could be anywhere between 2 and 4 more mobs patrolling the courtyard (Including boss) or the door you have to reach. 
---
* I usually feed, heal and dismiss my pet right before i start a new run so that i can instantly start moving once im in the dungeon to have better patrol timers, mobs will generally be in a more favourable position.  
---
When he FD next to the stairs, he was left at 1,3k hp. One-two extra hits, or random charge from the boss would have killed him. If he dies without AotC he won't be able to run up fast enough in Invisibility to pass safely the second pack. The issue there is that FD cd also won't be up so he can straight die unless manages all survival CDs in a safe spot while waiting for FD.
---
* with deterrence and monkey up im sitting at about 83% avoidance, so getting hit is actually pretty unlikely there, also i have only been charged by the boss when he wasnt in melee range, the eye timing is pretty sketch though, definitely could have spawned adds.
---
 When killing King there are also random stuff that can happen. Mage can fear your pet, or decide that every cast should be a 1.5 sec Mind Blast instead of a fireball. King can charge you post FD and guarantee you a new run. Biggest rng bug I've seen is for King to get aggro on me randomly after i FD+Drink. ***Not sure but this might be due to switching Aspects.*** 
---
* cho'rush can be a mage, priest or shaman, in my case he was a shaman so he will only lightning bolt, chain ligntning, earthgrab totem and can heal the boss when he is low. At 7:58 I actually feign at the same time as a charge, but its fine because i dont have serpent sting on him, it still puts me in combat, but my pet has higher threat so its completely fine.
---
Yep, just like in a real life environment, it's not fun for competent people to constantly have to carry the load for incompetent people who like having fun.  If a player's fun ruins the experience for someone else, then it's not their fault that they don't want to help the baddies any more.    
---
This isn't about being elitist, it's about having people who refuse to accept coaching and refuse to take responsibility for doing their part in a raid.  I think it's less prevalent now than it was in 2005, but back then the adults playing the game were often very hardheaded about accepting coaching because "It's just a game and this is a casual guild that plays for fun."
---
Totally agree with you.. You can chain pull almost forever if you dont spend too much mana. It is fast and efficient.
---
I only do multiple pulls when questing and there are allies in the nearbies (PVE server). I respect Horde guys and don't do greedy pulls, but if there are allies and not too many mobs (waiting for respawns, etc.), I will make the pet pull three at a time.
---
Maybe you should stop ninja'ing?
---
Mage groups intimidate me because they want 5,000 mobs pulled at once and since I’m still learning how to tank pulling so much makes me nervous LOL. Maybe I’ll try it out though.
---
Even the people that expected classic to do poorly still thought that within 6 months there would be 200k or so players at minimum still going.
---
Nobody really thought it would just completely die, they just didn't think the hype train of a million+ players was real or even close to sustainable.
---
The drop off has been more or less what I think most people expected.  Classic has probably dropped around 30-50% since launch.
---
#AddOns
---
This. 5 man dungeons are worse.
---
amen
---
But they want gold in return for doing a dungeon when we're all contributing to getting that gold even though we're all really running this dungeon for gear and the tank literally has no upgrades there so really it's only fair that he does it for free for 1/5 of the gold while we all get 1/5 of the gold+gear upgrades, right???
---
Best plan
---
For sure
---
I just got 60, no time for a break!
---
This is mainly just for open discourse. 
---
Im not dying on the hill of ”no-changes” like the other tit thought.
---
Its entierly possible that its the case. As i said i just keep hearing from guildies or random people i encounter that they remember using demo for aoe.  Perhaps theres some other element - and of course time/memory stuff.  So i dont dwell on it. Im not even a tank - im a healer. 
---
By ghosting i mean having a friend follow you and finish off mobs you tag, and you still getting full Xp the way it used to be.  
---
Currently it works the way it does post- making mob tabbing universal so anyone gets credit for a kill regardless of group or not - but a reduced XP equal in some way to your contribution to the death. 
---
The way it is now opens up greifing.  Say you are trying to level via grinding some mobs, and someone else wants to grind there aswell as a level 60 for mats etc, They can discourage you from staying there by killing your mobs and nullifying your reward (xp) for doing so.  And i have done this personally to a person that kept fucking with a guildie.  (Two mages fighting over aoe packs)
---
In regards to ToS. It was/is against ToS to ghost yourself. Aka logging on two accounts on one PC and do this (different to multiboxing) Same goes for abusing the mob-tagging in dungeons - as seen with Athene leveling in WOTLK. 
---
Again - not dying on this hill. I accept and agree with  changes such as the Tribute run fix to avoid stacking them. 
---
So some may say its ”cherry picking” but that would be looking at it with zero nuance. 
---
Other things are more iffy since its just changed and said ”we’ll it was actually like this..”  with no real reference to go on (or ive missed it) - again tin-foil, but why not atleast think about it. 
---
So as you can read, i myself have used the mob tag system to discourage  a player that - frankly just wanted to farm the same spot as another mage.  I believe mages should have some form of etiquette - move on if someone has this specific camp.  Yes noone owns a spot, but thats besides the point.  
---
Sort of the same as you ”dont” take someones herb if they are fighting a mob right on it.   You can, by all rights.  But theres some etiquette most people apply.  
---
Now, shower me in down votes bois
---
I swear i hear that all the time. Sitting on the toilet be like oh shit i just got buffed....
---
Well yeah, but if you're in a guild with a server first kill kind of attitude, things are different
---
Get 5/5 wand spec first and always keep your wand up to your level.  Then 5/5 Spirit Tap to erduce downtime while grinding.  5/5 Shadow Focus for +hit.  1/1 Mind Flay  2/2 imp psychic scream   2/5 Mind Blast  5/5 shadow weaving 1/1 Silence  1/1 Vamp embrace.  Then imp vamp embrace and Darkness.  Now you should be level 40 and you have to decide if you want to respec and get Shadow form or keep wand spec.  I personally kept wand spec and did ULD/ZF runs from 40-45 as heals.  My rotation would be Vamp Embrace, Mind Blast, SW: P, Mind Flay then Wand until the mob was dead to conserve mana so I felt the wand spec was too good to lose because any time saved by doing more damage was doubled by having to drink cause I burned through my mana pool in 2 mobs instead of 4 to 5
---
&gt; Feral - you couldn't decide between a warrior and a rogue so you thought "why not both". Better respec. 
---
Also, enjoy Gnomeregan
---
feel like normies make these memes, smh
---
You should really level first aid. Saving cloth for later is pretty dumb.
---
Good tanks are worth their weight in gold, especially since so many people got scared off the class going into Classic by overblown rumors of how "difficult" they were to level.  Tanks are the quarterback of dungeon/raid runs and quick/communicative runs will be remembered.  As a rogue, nobody will remember when I am doing well, only when I am shit (luckily I am never shit).
---
Bonereavers Edge and Perdition’s Blade I would think, both from Ragnaros.
---
Kinda depends... Most people in my guild already got their preraid bis or are missing 1-3 pieces max, so they are running dungeons to help each other, out of boredom or to gear alts. Kinda unwritten rule for everyone that if someone is in brd with their main and only need hoj, the alts would pass it to him. 
---
Another thing is that you collect a group that features someone that wants sgc from arena, someone that wants hoj, someone who wants something from golem lord and then fill the group with &lt;lvl 60s. Imo the most efficient way to run brd as everyone benefits and there is no loot issues.
---
the item u loot fairly commonly in DME. Spawn a plant that aggro everything in a small radius
---
Lol ok it’s 2005 again, watch out. No enh shamans or Ret paladins alowd
---
Report the mages. Any PvP on top of the mage is reportable and bannable. It’s an exploit of the guard system because the guards can’t get up there. It’s been a pretty hot topic on reddit the last few weeks
---
It's about community. If you rush all the things you yourself need and then just do nothing, then you are not the target audience
---
So you say we should just effectively ignore a big power spike because it’s simply a low drop? 
---
Bring this rationale to raids  🙄
---
You undervalue tanks. One orb for a strat live is way below what a warrior can make doing duo DM:E jump runs.
---
That is some fucking bullshit man.
---
Check the level of the far right reaver. If he's 59 you gotta be careful.
---
lol at anyone who joins a group with these demands. I made a strat live group in 5 minutes just by offering 1 orb to the tank.
---
It's easy, don't join them and make your own group. No reason to make a fucking Reddit thread about it.
---
They are totally entitled to do it like this, again you can just choose not to join.
---
that and mage/warlock
---
You wont miss anything. Even when Naxx is out, people will still be doing early raids
---
I dunno. Put on an ebook or a podcast or some Netflix and turn your brain off. I can do it for awhile. Basically 90% of my attention is on something else.
---
Works for some better than others I suppose.
---
In-game name? Let's play "where's /u/Dontfrown"
---
&gt;a wipe from "skipping mobs that should have been cleared"
---
If it was really accidental, I would say that is ' a wipe from "skipping mobs that should have been cleared".
---
If it's a random group, accidents happen.  You shouldn't kick people for accidents, not if they are genuine accidents.  On the other hand, you can't rely on completely random people to follow exactly as you say.  People just aren't robotic and you have to allow for that.
---
So I would say that the tanks job is to clear a path and if a mage backs into mobs by mistake, chances are that pack should have been cleared and maybe next time the tank will clear them to save a wipe and what will probably turn into a mud slinging argument.
---
Killing a trash pack never wipes the group (well, very rarely).  But leaving them alive increases the chance of a wipe many times over.  Smart tanks don't take chances.
---
We did a trash clear of mc the other day with about 20 ppl for rep grind and shit'n'giggles and we got 4 fucking druid drops off the trash within about 30 minutes of farming....went back next week for a 8/10 clear and got 2 druid pieces off the trash and that was it.... we only had 2 druids and by that point they already had those pieces...
---
Because they can, they just need to keep a separate set of gear for it which priests don't really need to do as much.
---
the proc isn't good
---
As a warlock we don't care about balance, as long as mages suffer. :-)
---
Simple addon to manage trinkets?
---
As an engineer i am losing hair over managing trinkets swapouts all the time :P
---
Easily simmed in the FC spreadsheet. Ironfoe is pretty crap compared to private servers
---
I would continue tanking dungeons, but try to find a priest healer that way you have free reign on all leather/mail/plate healing gear, and you don't have to worry about taking healing gear from the healer.
---
no i asked he had been spamming non strop for the hour i was gone
---
I'm gonna try that this evening when i do my vault runs but i am pretty sure you can just distract the dog and sprint close to the wall and he won't see you. He says it is not worth it to wait to use the vanish on the vault but he continues to pickpocket with vanish on CD. i just don't get the logic of actions.
---
So..18days later..did you buy all the crystals at 5g?
---
I did it before in an arena farm, rolled on the +healing ring as a mage because I misread the text. I begged the RNG gods to make me lose the roll but they must get a kick out of ignoring me because it was the only roll I won.
---
Still an upgrade tho
---
If you have a lot of gold at 35 (45+ g, say) you can train it right away if you're decent at generating gold, if you're  a lot below that you might as well wait with training it until you've gotten your mount. You can go on killing 45 mobs as level 40 I believe and still be able to skin them, so really no reason to upgrade it before unless you have plenty of gold. After all, it's 4.5 g that could be used toward getting your mount. Skinning catches up super quick once you train Artisan and can start gaining levels again.
---
Your choice
---
I followed those steps but I'm still level 1 D:
---
I was getting my alt mate the buff you can see the last half of my name "Happiness" in the bottom left area towards middle.
---
I got it on my first run with a group of 60s. Beat one of the lvl60 DPS on the roll.
---
IMO you are not a problem at all, players like you have minimal impact on the economy.    There are enough buyers and sellers already, your abstaining isn't impacting anyone else really.  You're a bit smug though.
---
Gee, thanks captain. 
---
Fury prot relies on blood thirst and similar zerker abilities for threat. I wouldn’t expect you to be stance dancing every BT cd and compound that with WW cd
---
Mind giving a description of what it does?
---
How is trash loot in mc handled in a pug. Does the guild running it loot everything besides bosses or does important stuff get rolled off?
---
i second that, classic's not going anywhere. Chill
---
Seeing how I was on my phone taking a shit when I posted this, wasn't really concentrating on my spelling lol.
---
well first of all ur reading comprehension needs some work, and maybe dont use the same insult like 5 times in one rant
---
yea no wonder u got no friends lol
---
It's OK but there are still too many grind steps added in. Not only that but I dinged 59 the other day and the guide has basically given up and told me 'there are no quests in Silithus in this phase so go grind to 60'.
---
This isnt a debate on the merits of a quality tank, the supply of willing tanks or the disparity of gold farming ability between classes.  Just out of principle, i will not pay someone to run a 5 man dungeon.  Im just sharing my opinion on the matter.  Clearly there is a market, i dont need it explained to me.  My point is there are alternative means to completing 5 man dungeons, people just lack creativity.  I also think paying people to participate in the game is a negative behavior thats not healthy for the community.
---
How about asking for physical dps instead?
---
Try to do queststhat are green for you and u might have a better time.
---
I feel you mate. 
---
It happens a lot that some players makes pulls if they feel it’s going to slow. 
---
For me it’s not a big issue since I am a warrior. I just use taunt basically at cool down all the time and it works. 
---
I can imagine it’s shit for palas without any taunt.
---
Oh yeah? How about the bindings that where ninjad on gehennas, blizzard stepped in there and fixed it, was a big server drama over it.
---
Hey guys, I was listening to a podcast the other day and they were saying that for leveling and PVP you should Spec as Arms until mortal strike then dump the rest into the fury tree. However, they said then once you are ready for Molten Core you should respec to a fury build... Why is that?
---
And you're getting what you pay for. A warrior who knows so little he does live strat for 20g when he could be doing 2 DM:E jump runs in that time for 50g.
---
I've watched a few youtube videos of hunters soloing princess in maraudon, and none of them use their pet for extra dps, presumably due to to princess' aoe attack. As far as I know it is nature damage so why not train max nature resistance and send them in?
---
&gt;maybe I gotta convince my gf to give it a try
---
Mine considers gaming a 'waste of time', sadly...
---
First fireball is always the tank. Tank has issues with threat in p3.
---
She can resist ur FD.
---
This. This x1000. Sometimes it seems like critical thinking is an altogether lost art.
---
Man on day one let me tell you there was a bunch of ding level 4 messages.
---
You use the pet to trigger her aoe attack that makes her stand still. She only casts this if someone is in melee range of her. If you do this correctly you can send the pet in, quickly send it back out and get free shots on her while she's immobile. In theory you could max nature resist on the pet but it's not necessary
---
They went alphabetical.  Thank the light.
---
If at anytime you are interested in rp communities, take a look into official forums. You can also ask there.
---
The communities nearly always have inofficial servers if there is nothing specified, and even then there is a clear roleplay hub along multiple RP servers (like "Die Aldor" in retail)
---
Might want to try and find a feral tank then. Ash covered boots drop in strat live, as does Tome of Knowledge (which becomes more useful once the AQ 1-handers are out).
---

if you actually think that anyone will ever get to kill any world boss you must be playing a different game

80% is extremely high, i've lost none!
---
Trinket menu! 
---
Also try GearMenu to switch those offhands or helmets fast aswell
---
this is correct
---
1. the sor holy damage doesn't proc anything
---
2. sotc speeds up attacks, adds extra attack power, but attacks do less damage per hit as the seal runs out
---
I generally leave it so I can report as many as I can so newbies, children and idiots don't fall for it.
---
100% truth. I often have to tell groups, "Its going to be faster clearing an extra couple mobs than to corpse run back and rebuff"
---
Also used in True Faith and a few other high priority crafts

I rolled a holy priest just to dungeon up to 60. Can't get past level 22 because no one wants to do SFK

Have you tried queuing heroic strike and cancelling it before the MH weapon hits? I thought I read somewhere that your off hand won’t miss while heroic strike is active. I haven’t really tried it and I think I read it’s a bug(?) but it’s something you can check out.

Maybe not you personally but I've seen too much drama over this to be confident in some general claims.

Gnome is the master race. All gnomes know this. All haters do not yet realize this.

I can't understand why you would see it as bragging. I also don't understand why you would deem it pathetic. He has in no way or form implied his grace or own superiority in his play time, but simply states it.
---
Calling it pathetic is just hurtful and ignorant. He could have an ocean of reasons to be playing the game for any amount of time. He is just has passion for the game, and is in a situation that allows him to play. He could be struggling with any problem in life, and cope by playing WOW. Calling it pathetic is just unnecessarily judgemental.

If only these costumes worked with shadowform :( double spook

I had a blood elf paladin named Holyanus during tbc and blizzard didn't care about that at all.
---
I would like you to support your previous claim with some viable statistics. Since you put yours out first, I'll wait for your reply.
---
Maybe your server's different, or maybe this specific guy is bad, or maybe it was off peak, or maybe he was lining up people for the next run to minimise downtime, I don't know what to tell you. I wouldn't assume the runs don't sell, though. It's a fair trade.
---
I'm duo farming that thing in these days. I'm in pain. I've seen it only 1 time since I do BRD, 1.fucking.time.
---
Ambush
---
They've been running MC for the last 15 years. They aren't going to stop in the next 15 weeks.
---
If this was the case then there wouldnt be endless lf tanks in the lfg chat. It's simple supply and demand. Plus, tanks have no real gold farming methods so this is how they make their cash.
---
Lazy guy checking in. I have 1 Enchanting skill so I can make a little extra cash without putting in any effort towards professions.
---
Warlock = you kinda wish you were a mage but you also fucking hate mages
---
Certainly. There's two separate scenarios we need to cover.
---
Scenario 1: Target's defence skill is at most 10 points higher than your weapon skill.
---
For each additional point of defence the target has over your weapon skill, you gain a 0.1% miss chance.
---
That's it. That leads to a 5% miss chance at equal skill, a 5.5% miss chance against +5 defence, and a 6% miss chance against +10 defence.
---
Scenario 2: Target's defence skill is at least 11 points higher than your weapon skill.
---
For each point of defence the target has over your weapon skill, you gain a 0.2% miss chance.
---
Also, there is a -1 penality applied to your +hit% bonus. Yeah, I know, crazy. It's not a -1% hit chance.
---
So against +15 defence, your 5% base miss chance increases to 8% miss. But, hilariously, because of that penalty to your +hit% bonus, you actually need +9% Hit to not miss.
---
What do you expect them to use? Leather?
---
Arms is generally better in pvp and works better without good gear.
---
Fury:  
---
Scales better with the gear that's available  
---
When raiding you don't have aggro and don't care about fury's increased damage taken.
---
I mean, its not that far-fetched (if that's what you're implying?) i was shadow up until 60 (for about a week as 60) and i was doing like 300ish dps single target at 60 with around 150 spell power, 450dps with 480 spellpower? easily doable
---
Truthfully, while you're leveling (till probably 57ish) you can tank just fine as arms. With the two of you as arms, you're basically just forming a melee cleave group which is a very common way to run instances. For some bosses it will be beneficial to use a shield/sword but I wouldn't worry too much.
---
I'm raid leading full MC and Onyxia clears atm and even I don't think there's any rush. It's gonna be here forever, at the end of the day
---
Yes I understand the mechanics. If I max nature resist on my pet and have it in melee range to attack but keep aggro on me it would be a presumably be a large dps boost.
---
I saw it drop in nearly every run I did ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Yes! Level 25s can fear and sheep a 60 and basically not get resisted in pvp at all. Do that do a pve job and you wouldn’t hit once 
---
It’s actually stupid how easy it is for say a level 50+ 2 lowbie casters to kill a 60, CC spells just don’t seem to get resisted at all.
---
I do remember it being possible to kill 60s with groups of lowbies in vanilla, but it seems like its way too easy to land spells.
---
at +16 i assume you are running. Muggers, aged gloves and distracting?
---
ditch the belt. you can also ditch the dagger if you have a better offhand. you only need +10 5 of which you get from talents
---
Why perfectly viable option especially for a human that benefits from the +5 to mace props to him for enduring the grind to get it
---
I haven't had a chance to sit down and play for an extended period of time. But as a lvl 60 warrior dps, I logged with the world buffs from Org. I want to do something productive but don't know what to set my focus on. I still have a long way to go for my bloodspear troll rep I was thinking about just farming runecloth like crazy? Any ideas of what to do?

Lots of pugs on my server go 8/10 or 9/10 and 1/1.

Some go 10/10

You guys aren't going to pass on deathchargers reigns because a fresh 60 in the group doesn't have his epic mount yet.
---
If the best you can come up with is I don't care who gets worthless items and vast generalizations, I think this is a solid win.
---
What makes down ranking suddenly better at 60 versus 59?
---
It is, but it's also the best tanking weapon just below TF
---
Lvl 60 Warrior, Lvl 60 Priest, Lvl 42 Warlock, Lvl 37 Mage

Havn't seen a single BoE worth over 10g &gt;:(
---
Can you say anything in /say or /yell?
---
Pedo alert
---
Let all the min-max players pay the new car tax.  Give it a couple weeks, prices will drop.
---
Yes. Exactly my point. Thank you.
---
Not sure if serious or...
---
Oh the horror.
---
I mean, most of those were just bad at the game too, unable to grasp the concept of simple things.
---
The community left behind are the people that truly appreciate the game, also no queuing and no competition for mobs.
---
I thought LFM was looking for more. If you dont have a group you put lfg but if you've got a person or two you put lfm so people know that they arent joining am empty group
---
Dude? Is this yawn funny
---
I just look for "tank", a feral is welcome to respond :) it's just that I've seen literally 1 of them on my server so far :P
---
Fire mages are absolutely beasts right now in p1
---
As long as they stick to DM, strat, scholo....
---
Locks are awesome. They destroy mages
---
There is no difference if the "sell" leads to a "use". The end result is the same, someone in the party gets a BoE epic.
---
The entire point of BoE items is to allow you to get them if they didn't drop. You literally cannot compare them to other loot because they were specifically designed not to be like other loot.
---
You cannot treat it like any other die roll because there is no other die roll where your gear can be exchanged for my gear at a 1/1 ratio.
---
And your the entitled one, acting like because you happen to be a certain class that that ENTITLES you to automatically win the lottery ticket that dropped for the party instead of letting the whole party get a chance to win it.
---
Your literally advocating for the option that only benefits one person instead of 5 and claiming to be selfless.
---
It’s better to farm gold with your best gold farming method and buy the runecloth but you do you.
---
let me guess youre a gnome mage
---
5 points into wand spec is better levelling than a warrior could ever dream of.
---
You must be special or something...
---
Start raiding whenever you can, the loot is crazy good and drops all the time even from trash.
---
Most typically a master looter would loot boss loot to themselves and then leave the guild.  That's a ninja.
---
So strange how he was banned just before he was about to name some very high-level NPCs in Orgrimmar and Stormwind. But if it sounds like a conspiracy, it's probably not.
---
Next you'll tell me Prestor's a dragon...
---
Typically a lot of random groups are formed to do all kinds of stuff. Just friendlist whoever seems like a cool person in those and ask them first when looking for another run later. A couple of them will stick. You will basically become one of the people they know.

Only if you are under 305 skill and you will still only miss 8%. Just need 9% hit.

Get parsec on your PC and phone. Launch the game when you leave the office on your phone and by the time you get home the queue will likely be either over or almost over.
---
I use parsec to play from my phone at work lmao.
---
This is how I feel. I know how to tank, but I don't know the end game dungeons. It's also why I don't pug much. I prefer learning dungeons with guildies, but my schedule hasn't lined up with guildies lately.
---
Just wait until pvp
---
Do stocks with a pally tanking.
---
What's the best way to get through Sunken Temple.  Last night was my first time in there (same for rest of the party too) and while we didn't have anyone die it still took us 2.5 hours to clear because we kept back tracking so much.
---
I get we need to clear the balconies before lighting the statutes.  But after clearing them we some some elite mobs where the boss would spawn.  So we jumped down, not a good idea with the fall damage, cleared the mobs, came back up the stairs,  wrong level a couple times, got back then lit the statues only to go back down for the fight.  
---
Next we had a hard time figuring out how to get to the level with the mini bosses.  We wound up back tracking several times on those.  
---
All told I figure we lost at least 45 minutes with not knowing the way.  And I'm not 100% sure I will be more effective when I go back in tonight.  I have to believe there are some visual cue's I missed.
---
I farmed 600 stacks and bought the last 100 stacks. It’s one hell of a grind.

---
Woah, is THAT how people turned into goblins pre-cataclysm?? I always saw people dancing in Orgrimmar as goblins during Wrath, but to this day I had never figured out what effect caused it! It's even a pirate like I remember!
---
Many that I have seen is it's like 5 guildies and 35 pugs. Just a way for them to reserve items.
---
weird, someone on the classic board complaining that retail is too hard...
---
And is broken tooth that rare spawn cat?
---
Reroll, you will be farmed for honor in phase 2
---
No it should have aggro on your pet
---
He is mostly pre-raid bis with a few epics from MC. Don't have exact gear at the moment
---
There is a true progression server launching this week on a private server project called project 1999.
---
It will start with classic and slowly release content patches in line with what was released on live, all the way through Velious.
---
Then, once that is complete, it will be wiped and start over. The wipe will probably happen in 2023.
---
If you ever played early EQ and want the truly nostalgic experience, NOW is the time to get it.
---
Ye
---
Then you’re fine my dude.
---
Broken tooth doesn't do more DPS than other cats. The rare cat just attacks faster. If I'm not mistaken? It's mainly for push back against casters you go broken tooth.
---
Any cat in general is probs best all round for DPS
---

I saw a hunter complaining about needing to pay a rogue to open the door in DM:N tribute runs. I simply said, "The man values his time". The hunter replied, "all he has to do is open a stupid door". The hunter literally wanted to give the rogue nothing.
---
I had to point out that this rogue could simply pickpocket BRD at 40g - 60g per hour. Why would he waste that hour "opening a stupid door" so a hunter could earn 406 - 60g an hour?
---
Not really an assumption. Not a blind one anyway. It's just what a lot of people have been saying here over the past 2-3 months. Natural to pick up the hear say without doing hours of research on my end to find out values for every quest.
---
Actually that’s incorrect. Most druids that I know are 30 points in feral and 21 in resto. It’s one of the strongest “healing” specs, and also allows you to tank and dps pretty well.
---
Tailor, so skipping 1st aid??😇
---
This is the true classic experience.
---
I still remember the first time I saw this and almost fell for it when I was first playing.  "Please whisper back your password to verify your account."
---
Less utility, moar BIGFATDICKPS
---
Think there is a setting called ‘sticky target’. Toggle that off and when you just click open space it will remove your current target.
---
Yeah, only reason I'm never eating mage food is because I eat corpses. Nomnom UD
---
Awesome bro,
---
Thanks for your very useful and not at all unwanted and unnecessary comment.
---
This sub is full of 35 year old dads who like to brag about how little they get to play the game in-between their miserable jobs and their wife. Fuck em
---
Levitate ain’t cheap.
---
I think I've killed Angerforge 20 times, and I've not even seen it drop.
---
I did get his 1h sword though, which supposedly has a lower drop rate than HOJ.
---
15% is a lot, don't forget how much dmg the auto shot is doing.
---
Hmm? Even in fury pve spec you will have tactical mastery, in terms of utility the only difference is healing debuff. You do way more dmg with shield equipped for example as fury. There is 0 reason for any1 going arms pve.
---
I'm a mage, was nowhere near the top of the threat meter in p1, but still got hit by 3 consecutive and 4 total fireballs in p2
---
And she still ran at me as soon as she landed in p3 without me damaging her at all in the transition.
---
Okay nice so did you just follow him or can you get xp dungeon wide? Would a 60 just blitzing you through quests give similar xp. You get mininal mob xp but handing in loads of quests would still be good xp. I guess missing out on mob xp means you would finish a zone 2-3 levels lower than usual
---
Ain't that the truth
---
This... It's only going to get worse lol
---
Use curse of recklessness to decrease their armor, or the shadow debuff for your shadowbolts. If the mobs are dying too fast for sb, just wand those fucks.
---
Ah, so with your "conscious level of intelligence" you don't need to understand human history?
---
I had guilds asking me to join as a Shadow Priest. Just find some normal people to play with that understand we don't need 40 people in every raid with every consumable and enchants to be able to down MC/Ony.
---
I have the exact opposite problem in Hillsbrad (on Rattlegore as well). Trying to quest and keep getting ganked by ?? Alliance until all us horde join up as a roving death squad to return the favor.
---
I’m surprised this works too, cos aren’t the mobs in different places. Although I suppose if he AoEs enough they’ll go down eventually. Besides its probably more complex than:
---
1. Swim to cage
---
2. Loot
---
3. AoE 10 times
---
4. Swim to next cage
---
Well done to whoever developed it. A lot of time was probably spent perfecting it. Clever use of otherwise useful skills too.
---
So I'm a spriest main who started playing in Wrath and always placed nicely on the dps charts. Rolled a spriest in classic before seeing that everybody basically shits on their PvE here. 
---
Just dinged 51 last night and I'm always curious to read these threads because I don't know if I should stick with spriest or just reroll a mage/lock since I actually want to do some real PvE at some point once I hit 60. 
---
What sort of stat prioritization should I be going for? I found like 4 different pre-raid BiS lists for spriests and kind of just looked through those and picked something to aim for for each slot. I'm mainly basing it strictly on added shadow damage / spell damage but I feel like going straight for damage sacrifices a lot of spirit / int.
---
Ah, the way you described it made it sound like he used to completely disengage from combat after a feign so you could fight the king alone.
---
Love the Bloodfang EU community. Hope to catch you around in a dungeon somewhere.
---
Pretty sure it did for a while (not sure if it’s like that any more)
---
Sub numbers for WoW quadrupled once Classic released.

 [https://github.com/watchyoursixx/classic-hunter/wiki/Ranged-Attack-Table#target-at-3-levels-5-weapon-skill-n582](https://github.com/watchyoursixx/classic-hunter/wiki/Ranged-Attack-Table#target-at-3-levels-5-weapon-skill-n582) 
---
It's been tested.
---
Broken Tooth attack speed is just an added benefit against casters in PvP. Also more uptime on frenzy with less talent points invested.
---
Wolf/Worg provide an attack power buff to next physical attack that is beneficial to you and melee in your party. Have to be within 20 yds of pet though. 
---
Owls with screech for holding aggro better 
---
Windserpents have a ranged attack in Lightning breath, I do not know if their base attack is ranged as well. 
---
These are the 4 staples I have seen. Board get used a lot in PvP for stun/root I believe, never got into em really.
---
Drop enchanting if you want to make money with professions lol
---
What about this lump on my ball can you check that
---
Kind of like retail? I actually really enjoyed that feature.
---
Ideally for me, I roll into a town, pick up a bunch of quests and go adventure for a few 2-3 hours.
---
It’s why I love the Barrens so much.
---
In some of the zones the optimal way to quest is to do 2-4 quests then travel to a different zone, do 2-4 quests, return to previous or go to another zone and do quests there. (Dustwallow for instance.)
---
Give me a ton of quests and let me figure out how I want to do them.
---
Granted there is also decision making with how Classic is set up too with choosing what zone you want to go to, but I have a feeling a lot of players just struggle through yellow and orange quests and out-level say, Stonetalon and end up not doing it at all rather than leaving the Barrens and coming back later on.
---
That doesn’t change the fact that the people playing 10 hours a day are the ones most likely to be creating or engaging with content about the game and generating attention for it (Streamers, youtubers). Without new content, these people would move on to other games. Keeping the hype going by pushing out new content is a much better business tactic than simply saving bandwidth on casual players.
---
Is optimal raid configuration super necessary for phase 1 in classic? Not trying to sound shitty, legitimately curious. I didn't start playing until Wrath.
---
This game is slowly turning into the *more supply than demand* on items. Which is causing some rare things to plummet. Pristine black diamonds are 5g from 150g. Orbs down to 8g. Bis epics rarely sell, even for half the price. Its crazy.
---
I play a fury warrior and got Earthslag Shoulders (some pala shoulders with +heal) the other day. At first I thought "I don't wanna wear those", but they were an upgrade, so I kept them. Later it crossed my mind, that the healing effect might increase the healing on Bloodthirst and leveling would be so much easier having some self heal. Unfortunately it didn't work. I feel betrayed.
---
So, why are +healing items not counted towards the healing effect on my Bloodthirst?
---
You sound broke. I have a reaper.
---
I am in your boat, which happened to me back when I played Vanilla, too.
---
There is absolutely nothing wrong with leveling alts and switching up what you play often. It keeps the game fresh in a way. The game isn't going anywhere, no matter what people on Reddit say.
---
Besides, if you keep leveling alts and you eventually end up with numerous Max level characters, you'll have options for days!
---
I'm pretty sure that's Echeyakee.
---
Echeyakee has more damage but a lower attack speed so he's got the same dps as any other cat just with better threat generation.
---
But Broken Tooth has higher dps in general cuz his attack speed is higher than normal but his damage isn't less than normal.
---
I could be wrong tho
---
Just trying to explain to you that you should be posting this on server forums or ingame channels, and *with proof*. Anyone can make a claim that someone else is a ninja, and it doesn't matter unless you can back it up.
---
It's really simple: if you have a guild and you invite people to your raid, **and you don't tell everyone that you are reserving items for your guild members** you are stealing their time and effort.
---
I can't believe I have to explain this to you.
---
Lol it's not like you can't farm them in the raid.
---
Oh, that's why I can't ever get a soul shard when I'm grouped with warriors....
---
Unless you know...they’re horde
---
I see, def possible.
---
I have my answer since you took it as an accusation.  Easy enough to say no if that was the case.  Congratulations on being a narcissistic douche.
---
For sure. I put crusader on mine when I got it, level 60 now and still using it. Upgrades are pretty much limited to epics and dal rends, minus a few potential very minor upgrades.
---
You're gonna be so bad at pvp if you do that, my friend...
---
WoW classic, even among my group of friends has gone from nostalgia trip to "muh pre-BiS" within a month.
---
For tank its easy: Dal'Rends mainhand is much too slow, keep ironfoe. 
---
For DW I'm not sure, but probably keep both. In single target bossfights where bloodlust is more prevailant Ironfoe, on whirlwinding the slower weapon might be the better choice.
---
I know how it works. But it isn’t like I’m doing a /who of one zone and hitting cap then saying ok that’s 50. I’m counting everything by manually inputting for class and guild. I’m doing the exact same as the addon. But people uploading reports can for sure be an issue. If someone doesn’t do it for one faction very often, then it’s skewed. To get an idea you can look at the data from Wowhead when they posted the census reports last time right before Blizz broke it. They have one realm showing its 99.1% of one faction which... isn’t possible.
---
Ill give you that doing your own who scan for big realms is very hard but (un)lucky for us Heartseeker has basically no horde so you never even hit the cap when you who a contested zone that isn’t STV. Like I said just pick any time at random and who a med-high level contested zone on both factions. You’ll never see even close to a 60/40 split.
---
 Hunter: [https://discord.gg/8TVHxRr](https://discord.gg/8TVHxRr) 
---
Take a look at the Classic Hunter Discord its got a lot of good info and helpful people. 
---
The truth is there is no real answer to this question. No one pet is "the best" for all play styles. Broken Tooth is a rare cat in Badlands with the fastest attack speed (DPS is normilized all cats do the same DPS regardless of attack speed) better for PvP spell push back. 
---
Wind Serpents are argued as best PvE pets becasue they are ranged and die less because of this. The best on is Son of Hakkar in Sunken Temple becasue he has the max level pet ablilty Lighting Breath
---
Owl/Carron Birds/Boars/Wolves are in constant completion for leveling pets. All offer a good ability (AP debuff for enemies or AP buff for you) or CC (Boars have charge w/ stun).
---
If you want the pet recommendation that if you show up with to a raid/5 man/leveling group get Broken Tooth and call it a day.
---
This sums up my feelings as well too also.
---
If you invite a PUG into your raid because you cannot raid on your own due to not enough members, and you state MS &gt; OS rules, which was probably the case here, you HAVE to give the PUG's a fair chance at actually getting the loot. Else why would they even join the guild run? PUG time is worth less than the guild member's time? PUG's don't exist just to ensure easier and faster loot for a guild, they're there cause you know, they hope to get something out of it. If a guild does this, it's a ninja guild and should be avoided at all costs.
---
I agree it's very annoying for PUG's to consisently win rolls, which is the case in my guild, like 5-6 last good drops were won by PUG's even though it was 90% guildies rolling... But it should still be honored, no matter how annoying it is.
---
It's not worth it for a tank warrior to get this ;) 
---
It's an ok tanking sword, but there are significantly better options.
---
Just launch it an hour before leaving or so. I use a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse to play, but you don't need that to launch the game, just use the touchscreen and tap the launch button in the blizzard launcher.
---
Just make sure to leave your PC on, of course.
---
MadSeasonShow and Platinum make good non+guide videos imo.
---
Sweet. How much did you pay for crusader?
---
* Arms with OEB, FTFY
---
Noticed it too pexing as a prot warrior, even with grey level mob you do tech high damage where I was expecting my armor to be much more impactful and to almost block all of it.
---
It's really strange
---
As a rogue...all I want...well almost all I want, is for the tank to pull the mob 4 feet back, so I can get behind it and stab it without taking shots to the back of my head from that other mob down the way.
---
Okay...I’m talking dungeons, not raiding.
---
On my server Orbs are at 40g and Warden Staff/Freezing Band are both 350-500g or so
---
? So just do BFD or go questing. Put on PW:Shield, start wanding your target and watch your favorite tv show.
---
I'm getting increasingly confused by pre-raid BiS You can get into MC the moment you hit 60 (hell even before you hit 60) with the gear you leveled in and you can be the most casual of dads whose ever played. Your "pre-raid" period at 60 can last 5 minutes.
---
True tbh as a healer u get quite nice and chill friends to play with, havent encounterd your type portal, but i see a lot of people starting from wc up to brd, usually when we see each other we /hello eachother and have a small talk while we clear the same dungeon, really makes the run nicer
---
Would be nice if you weren’t such a bitch
---
he wrong, fury is pvp and pve, fury is life
---
That GM is full of shit
---
If you have frenzy, it's the highest damage pet in the game; and most hunters are leveling in BM and taking frenzy. It's minimal compared to a 1.2 AS cat, but it *is* higher.
---
Or an hour and a bit every two days... which is a lot if you have other responsibilities.
---
Why is it mind boggling? The biggest problems shadow priests have are running oom and not having debuff slots available. Not only is he getting ressources allocated to him in order to circumvent these (slots + innervate) he even gets PI on top of that. And after all that special treatment which results in 95% parses, he still can barely compete with top dps classes that dont get any of that.
---
That is super handy, thanks for the details!
---
Good, its not supposed to go off lol. Youre queuing HS to make your offhand hit.
---
Why would you get enrage for pve arms (raiding)? If you get crited in raid, you are dead anyways. You are far better of going improved cleave and improved execute.
---
I noticed that I went from 630 to 750 somehow, not sure if it was just my add-on seeping out though, didn't really check with heal amounts.
---
A very nasty and small-minded opinion you have there. Suggest you have more empathy for others it will improve your life.
---
They randomly fixed the touch room exp with no mention or explanation.
---
some people enjoy the support role, something that people from retail won't know because there isn't anything like that in retail anymore. It's not all about damage but also helping others when needed. Buffs, heals, offtank in case of emergency... all possible.
---
You're fine dude, this is an upgrade for you. 
---
If you wanna be cautious in the future, you could call out your intention to need on items that people may not expect you to need on right at the beginning. But seriously, you're fine.
---
Some hunter had a bot going outside of booty Bay in an area that I needed quest drops. At least it his case you can time  a low damage/aggro attack right before theirs. You will get the mob but they will take aggro, the bot should ignore the mob and die from it eventually.
---
Also report them with time and location.
---
This is true. As a warrior I have very little in dungeons so I’m able to pay more attention to other people’s resources. 
---
If I stop pulling it’s because my healer has no mana and is drinking. Period. 
---
Just a matter of consideration. Like. Woah. I can heal. Maybe I should top off the person I came to help? Hhhhmmmmmmmmm.
---
No groups will accept me because too low. Don't wanna do questing again that's why I rolled Holy
---
Chipotle is great if you hate your life and asshole
---
It's not classified as a spell.
---
is this real life?
---
Warlock: you want to raid, is it? You better farm up a LOT of soul shards. Oh, and you have to be at the raid entrance early, if you're on a PvP server, that means you'll likely run into the other faction's raid and will be obliterated/camped until they're finished summoning/preparing and zone in.
---
Think you got enough soul shards? Nah. People will ignore your summon, lie and say they never got it, afk and miss it, or will take it then hearth back because they forgot arrows/pots/bandages/pants/brain and will beg for another summon.
---
Okay, now you're in the raid. Things go well, break time. You've earned it 
---
Just kidding.
---
Fuck you. No break. 
---
Run your ass back to the entrance and prepare to summon those that ported out during break for whatever reason.
---
This is where I’m at.
---
A couple days ago, someone messaged me asking if I had a Ravager and wanted to do SM Armory. I said yeah and yeah. Enter a group as the 4th warrior plus one Paladin, no tank. Pally had cocaine energy and wanted to heal a 4DPS group. We wiped twice because of one person pulling too aggressively, but overall, it was a very fast and smooth run!
---
When you can no longer skin the animals you're killing. At that point you're losing gold.
---
I didn’t get -150 consistently but it happened at least a couple times a week
---
Hmm as a disc priest and playing horde I still use heal and greater heal. We did ony last night and I was 3rd out of 9. If I'm honest I don't really use renew that much and only use sheild on dps at times. It seems you should be doing more general healing if I'm honest
---
&gt;I didn't know bots could be this complicated. I thought they would just stand in one place repeating an action. I didn't know they could actually travel around and even fight (when aggroed on, and with the same ability rotation).
---
While self driving cars aren't officially on the market yet, we've had self flying quadcopters that'll track a human operator in real time through a 3D environment using nothing but visible light cameras and consumer hardware for a while now.
---
By comparison, walking around in a computer game is extremely simple.
---
And they are free to the loot that the guild doesn’t want. 
---
Pugs are free to make their own groups if they don’t like. It’s a given that BIS items are going to the master looters choice. It’s common sense.
---
Pugs are replaceable trash.
---
[Which would you rather look at?](https://i.imgur.com/alov0DT.png)
---
I feel like when Deathwish/Recklessness is over or if you manage to pull aggro during the late stages of your recklessness and die but still did a shit ton of damage i feel like:
---
"Do what you must, i have already won."
---
Mortal strike is a great reason.
---
warlocks, priests, druids and rogues I think.
---
Paladins should be able to solo dm:e too, but not sure about shamans.
---
And when you spam a normal thing like ''LFM UBRS JED/REND'' the first thing people will whisper is ''how many people need X or Y?'' 
---
It's like people don't wanna play the game.
---
We were contemplating it, but we're considering just holding off until BWL now. We already clear Ony + MC way before raid time is up, no need to cut it any shorter I guess.
---
I wouldn't worry too much at this point but if you are looking for endgame then check out the BiS lists out there and once you get to the appropriate level probably 52+ then start striving for those pieces. Right now i wouldn't worry though. you'll still be replacing that gear regularly.
---
I am a 42 Druid on the same server. I haven’t had too much issues now I am out of stv. Though I have moved on to tanking instances. Been spending most my time in badlands.
---
If it's an alt you should be able to buy nice BoEs... that's why I love leveling other characters.
---
15 seconds, huh...
---
https://i.imgur.com/QKQqMNe.png
---
Oh, priest sounds fun, huh. 
---
You're going to be potent as fuck as a healer. Every dungeon will be ez mode, you're going to feel like a god. Even out in the world, you're going to be able to spit in Death's face and scream NOT TODAY with zero effort. You're going to be a goddamn hero all the time. No one will die in your presence, *unless you want them to.* 
---
You know what else will not die in your presence? Mobs that you're soloing. Oh, you're not going to die either, but watching their health tick slowly down with wand swings is going to feel like a level of hell you didn't know existed. You will watch literally every other class chew through mobs in seconds, while your kills take minutes. Oh, yeah, you can go shadow at 40 once you can get shadowform, sure. And then you're going to drink every other mob. Oh, what's that, you don't want to heal? Good luck find a raid where you can be the token Lock buffer. You will be told frequently to just go heals, and it's going to seem like the best option because damn it doesn't seem like Blizz planned anything else for your class. They didn't, so rest assured your fellow healers are probably suffering nearly as much as you. Not quite as much, because what they give up in pure healing power they get in DPS. You? You're a wand bitch. Start swinging.
---
I think most meters count absorbs as heals.
---
Can someone explain to me why are +Defense and +Hit% so important stats for tank warriors? And what amount should I look to get through gear?
---
Never been on a reserve run but as a healer i've never been treated special. As a matter of fact I lose healing needs to warlocks and mages all the time. They think because it's cloth and it's armor value is better it's a need.
---
AOEtards
---
Celebras sounds like an ED pill.
---
They had druids in classic?
---
From recent experience, I thought the game only had mages, mages, mages, more mages, and the occasional warriors and priests!
---
People lack creativity.  Fury warriors can tank, bears can tank, paladins can tank. A well organized group can go with no plate class at all.  Does noone see the irony here?  The classic wow mob loves the bring the player not the class, fuck ilevel, fuck achievement rah rah.  But the idea of not having a prot warrior tank for even the most trivial 5 man content is too much.
---
2k hp?
---
My God warrior tanking has changed lol
---
OmniCC does that and more. I've been using that add-on in some version since TBC and it's fantastic.
---
demonic runes are even more useful if you're an armorsmith, you can make the demon forged breasplate, which further helps aoe farming
---
Well, this is frustrating. I am arms spec (currently level 36) because I read it was the best for PvE. I even went out of my way to make sure I got the Whirlwind Axe because everything I read said it was best for arms, and arms was best for PvE.
---
I'm a level 60 Warrior, currently leveling a Druid alt. I'm 300 Mining/Blacksmithing, but as a Prot Warrior I really don't spend much time in the open world, and in the future I plan on playing my druid (Herb/Alch) more often if I want to grind up mats/money (repair bills are way cheaper). Is it worth it to switch to Engi/Blacksmithing on my Warrior? I've heard the utility that engineering gives is great, especially the dynamite for tanks, but I've never leveled one myself. Thoughts?
---
I love Kirotonos and have not had nearly as bad as a time as people usually say with the imbalance. It’s always real busy, even with less alliance. Fairly populated realm, always dungeon runs, always people pugging ONY/MC.
---
Do yourself a favor and run Strat and Scholo, the cadaverous chest, the mask of the unforgiven, do the mark of fordring questline in EPL, do DM, stop grinding BRD so hard and Ubers when you have good % to get the mele stuff. I had the same expirence, but the rng gets a lot better once you leave BRD and stop killing yourself doing the same stuff.

**HORDE - NA - HEROD - PVP**
---
Holy Priest looking for raiding guild 7-10PM EST Monday-Thursday.
---
I also have a friend that is a Druid tank that is looking for the same raid times and days. 
---
Raiding exp:
---
Full cleared everything in TBC.
---
Full cleared everything in WRATH in including Heroics. 
---
Full cleared up to Firelands in CATA.
---
&gt; this isn't retail and wipes happen. 
---
on average, i've had more wipes in retail m+ than in classic. classic has been figured over the last 15 years, it is laughably easy. there's only two scenarios i can think of right now that can cause wipes; pulling too many ghosts in dmw that oneshot the entire group with bad rng, and infinitely healing treants in dme that will slowly overrun your party
---
&gt; Now what I do in BRD is purposely wipe 2 times in the first 5 packs to gague the type of party it is 
---
if you did this in my group or with anyone i know, i'll assume you're trolling, kick you/leave and ignore you
---
I can definitely see the concern here. Disc priests still generally heal in classic. Its played similar to a holy priest with the ability to cast PI on a mage. 
---
If you were shielding the tanks thats also a huge no no because that makes the tanks absorb damage which doesnt generate rage - thus reducing the threat they produce because of a lack of rage.
---
Aye that's quite true. As a horde, I've not encountered owls until I entered felwood (starts at level 47). 
---
You might like bats as well, they have the same damage modifier as owls and have access to screech.
---
With 225 skill you could skin to mobs up to level 45.  
---
So if you start to kill mobs level 42-43, it's time to get your artisan skinning.
---
I bet he just added him to /ignore, reported, and is going about his day.
---
The thing that really bothers me a lot is ability pruning. I hate that. I can live with some of the other changes like removing talents, revamping old zones. 
---
But this whole ability pruning has made classes just not fun to play. And that’s the worst thing because if the immediate game play is not fun, the whole thing just falls apart. 
---
It’s not even funny how much more I enjoy my shaman on classic compared to bfa. Each class feels like a stripped down version of itself with all the uniqueness gone. I know vanilla is not perfect and balance is not ideal, but each class is unique and there is something to love about each one. They have their own identities. Something which bfa doesn’t have and many other mmorpgs don’t have either.
---
The only extra "Utility" Arms bring over a standard Fury PvE spec is improved hamstring and piercing howl.
---
As a healer, I tend to keep my distance to the fight. Once we're out of combat, I usually need to drink. If the tank is already moving on, dodging patrols, I often find said patrols between me and the rest of the group, having to wait until the patrol has moved on. 
---
So please, if you intend to skip trash, make sure that the path you are taking is clear for sufficiently long so even your healer and other ranged classes can follow you.
---
Arms has high burst damage. This makes it optimal for PvP, where you want a heavy burst to blow people up before they get healed (especially with the healing reduction on mortal strike) and do as much damage as possible in a small window before ranged classes use movement skills to get away from melee range. You essentially want as much up front as possible, as you're only going to be getting to hit your target for a limited period of time.
---
Fury has high sustained damage, where they will consistently put out a lot of damage over a longer period of time. In PvE, your targets typically stay put, giving you much more time on target, and fights typically last longer. This means that Fury warriors can keep going with their damage, as well as being better at executing because they generate a ton more rage and it's not based on weapon damage. With how long bosses with large health pools stay below 20% health and how dangerous the last 20% of a fight can be (due to healers running OOM, enrage timers in some later content and other stacking mechanics), that's a big deal.
---
Arms is fine leveling and solo, but for endgame PvE, the two aren't comparable. Arms does not have enough sustained damage to compete at a decent level, but they will blow people up in PvP
---
It was a joke
---
It's worth way too much money to justify not needing it. If you want it, farm the cash for it instead of expecting others to give up the chance on that that gold.
---
Depends on a lot of factors but for me it certainly did not. It was easier to get into pugs because people would see I was in a respected guild. Also I got fed a bunch of gear that people didn't want (epic first weapon in BWL and ony head) when I filled in for 2 weeks over the holidays.
---
You got me, you got me :)
---
Not how it works. If you're selling the finished product for less than you could sell the mats for, you're losing money, full stop. It's not "all profit" it's giving money away for free. You don't understand economics.
---
Also, no one wants "a quick sale to get it out of their inventory" on a 200-300g item, wtf are you on about.
---
Hidden troll village AoE farming is pretty good afaik.
---
Unless you’re a tank :)
---
TL;DR: Huntard was just being a huntard.  Possibly optimize your rotation and mark targets.
---
60 Paladin here. Also tanked 5-mans as a Paladin back in Vanilla all the way through Dire Maul.  Some things I’ve learned the hard way tanking as a Paladin:
---
1) Use Seal of/Judge Wisdom, and drop max rank Consc. on initial pull.  Only ever us Seal of Righteousness on boss fights. Judgement of Wisdom procs on consc ticks and gives you endless mana.
---
2) If you’re the tank your party gets Blessing of Salvation - fuck what they want, it’s your decision not theirs
---
3) Righteous Fury is a buff, make sure it’s up
---
4) Use Ret Aura; if heals are lacking that’s not your concern.  (Obviously there are limits to this, but this should be the general rule.)
---
5) Explain to your party that you don’t have taunt and you need 2 ticks of consecration before they open their DPS rotation
---
6) GIVE PROBLEM DPS SOMETHING TO DO e.g. if you have a huntard giving you problems mark a mob form them to freeze trap (even if you don’t need the extra CC). This will make them feel valued, and keep them occupied long enough to not ruin your pulls.
---
7) The ONLY DPS I consistently have issues holding aggro for are Hunters and Warlocks.  Specifically when Warlocks DoT mobs you’re not auto-attacking and Hunters b/c they literally have 0 chill and live to pull mobs off you, feign death and get their healer killed.
---
As a healer, I like having a shadow priest in 5-mans because the small amount of healing they do means I can slack off and regen mana on small pulls.
---
But arnt you glad your getting "the real classic experience" on a PvP server. but seriously these other people are right once phase 2 drop your life just gets worse. Find a guild on a normal server and start over. Then in Phase 3 you can get the PvP action whenever you want and none when you dont.
---
What is the best way to level my paladin? I can’t decide going straight ret or going down holy to consecrate so I have more aoe ability during questing as well as the one or two dungeon runs as the tank to get the quests done. Any suggestions?
---
Yup. At least when the mage drinks its because they did huge AoE dmg to trash packs.
---
It was more of just an interview but here is what I was listening to 
---
https://youtu.be/KzQ4P6huu6M
---
 /cleartarget works just as well but that's not what I am asking.
---
you are literally a waste of the air you breathe.
---
My shadow dps is extremely competitive in dungeons. If a boss dies to fast I change my rotation up, but I've kept up and beat some good dps. The spriest who try and understand their class will do pretty good dps in dungeons. I've gotten multiple whispers from pugs asking how my damage is so high. Everyone seems to be kinda shocked because the spriest is supposed to be bad, but in reality in the current state of classic wow it's not bad, is it amazing best spec ever, no but it's the most fun i've had in wow.
---
Grinding Mobs for XP only would be boring. I only grind mobs if there's also some sort of crafting material and/or item/plan drop involved.
---
However, grinding dungeons strictly for XP is the same thing. It's repetitive and dull.
---
Not normally, no. Certain foods can be, but they're normally the BiS raid food (i.e., Grilled Squid/Tender Steak/Tuber Surprise). If you pair it with fishing, you can make money off of Grilled Squid, but it's not enough gold/hour to really be worth it as a money making method. I normally just use it as a relaxing method that makes some money on the side.
---
Sure you are not playing retail? I know each server is different, but I've not seen noobs turned away yet on the classic server I'm playing on. My MC and Ony groups had new ppl in each week. Its not like vanilla raid mechanics are hard, and 5 mans are much easier.
---
You made your bed picking a PVP server, you gotta lie in it.
---
As a 42 mage you have the enormous advantage of being able to spellcleave ZFK, I know you'll probably argue it's not fun, but I'd argue that being spawncamped isn't fun either.
---
Considering that is the only content we have actual information and statistics for seems like we shouldn't get ahead of ourselves.
---
Skullforge Reaver off Baron
---
Depends on the level but I would pay around 50s with going to the warlock so he can continue whatever he is doing or 1-3g with the wl coming to us depending on his way. I'm a lvl 60 hunter.
---
Cooking isn't too valuable outside of a few select recipes that people use while raiding. If just use it for leveling, and trade some to people and when you get the chance. The Goodwill from your charity will probably get you further than selling it
---
You still can login to the game even if you canceled your sub, right?
---
Please throw out all your gear then delete your character to post proof here, thanks.
---
No addons is gross.
---
This but unironically.
---
Of course, the only inherent price these things have are their vendor price. The AH price is completely arbitrary, something collectively decided upon by the player base.
---
As in I don’t judge unless some making it painfully obvious that there is something wrong. You can no way say playing a video game 20 hrs a week for 14 days straight is healthy man... like I’m not one to judge if someone is drinking... when they decide to go on a 2 week long bender and are drunk 20hrs/day then there is a time to say... ok we can help
---
Improved cleave is super trash tier, noobtrap of a talent. Enrage is nuts. Really good outside of raids, and insanely good if you tank as DPS in a dungeon.
---
You can probably convince a few mages to come with you if you include the Flame lizard boss as it drops a decent farming trinket
---
&gt;The best on is Son of Hakkar in Sunken Temple becasue he has the max level pet ablilty Lighting Breath.
---
Son of Hakkar is in ZG, you can't get him yet. Sunken Temple has *Spawn* of Hakkar.
---
I do my guild/pug UBRS/DM/School/strat runs as Shadow and I do great. Multidot is super strong since you're not doing pulls that consist of half the instance with three mages. Usually doing around 250-350 dps. 
---
Spell cleave groups while leveling are another story. I healed most of those. Can't really do much as Shadow.
---
Record a video.  Report.  And post the video here.

Death to botters. Cancer.

Be careful with this.

Gambling is not allowed, and Blizzard has issued bans over it.
---
Usually it's from people spamming trade for gambling, and you might be fine doing it closed in a guild/raid. Just thought you should know.
---
I did. It seems I am not the only person who misunderstood the true intent of your original post. Good clarification, minus the ad hominem insults.
---
Mmm tanks who watch mana.  
---
Also I’m dispelling a bit. Not as much as healers but I keep an eye out. Meanwhile I do a dungeon with a mage and the tank is cursed and I’m falling for decurse and I get decursed with no curse on me and the tank is still only getting 25% heals
---
Thank you for the information. :)
---
I'm a lover of default, and I actually enjoy the new action bars on Retail. Prepare to throw up:  [https://imgur.com/a/K0qGDAB](https://imgur.com/a/K0qGDAB) 
---
I'd love to have my portraits in the center of my screen, but every time I log off it resets their positions, i've not yet figured out which addon is doing that
---
Don't know why those are even on by default. First thing I changed with Necrosis was those speeches (well, that and the laugh sound when something is Fear immune)
---
Mine is GoldmanNaxx :)
---
+defense increases block/dodge/parry and more importantly with enough of it you can make it so raid bosses cannot critically hit you. 
---
+hit% does what it says and increases chance to hit. This means you will miss the boss less and will have better threat meaning your DPS can DPS more. 
---
I don't know on the caps unfortunately!
---
For your level Arms is the most common spec, and the Whirlwind Axe is by far the best weapon for it. The only alternative is The Ravager from SM armory because of its Whirlwind proc (mostly useful in group content).
---
At level 60 you can simply respec to Fury if you want to dps in pve content.
---
I think you should go down to consecrate first priority, then do whatever. Not entirely sure how valuable it is for questing, but if you ever want to tank dungeons, you're useless without it.
---
Some stuff can be profitable if you keep an eye on the ah, buy the mats when they are cheap and sell the food when it's in demand. The 8 stam/spirit food definitely isn't worth 3g.

Grilled Squid, Nightfin Soup, Dragonbreath Chili

Your “friend”is an asshole

My favorite is "LFM All, tank healer and 2 dps". I see that and I'm 95% certain that person is going to ninja something along the way.
---
Yea that’s nothing new. Sünder&gt;hs
---
There has not been any confirmation of TBC.
---
Many will quit if they release TBC. Many came to play vanilla, not all the godawful expansions.
---
*casts Slow Fall* Next
---
No, Sticky Target does not remove auto-targgeting when you get hit.
---
As a healer I shouldn't be going OOM after one pull if my group is good even if they want to speed run. That's why they're complaining. If you're playing that way you're not playing optimally and you're slowing down the run, in addition to annoying your healer. There's nothing fun about spam healing a bad group who thinks they're "speed running" and then having to waste a ton of money and time drinking after every pull. I'd never run with you again.
---
I guess leverage if they are wanting to become a MT in a future guild? I'm sure a GM would consider A player with 1 binding more valuable than B player with no binding if all their other gear was more or less the same. This is WITHOUT them doing a trial, so skills or lack thereof is a non-factor.
---
&gt;But Broken Tooth has higher dps in general cuz his attack speed is higher than normal but his damage isn't less than normal.
---
This is wrong. Broken Tooth hits twice as often as a cat like Echeyakee, but each hit is half the damage.
---
I'm a druid tank and land it in cat every time. You're doing something wrong.
---
I remember mage or pally sell zf xp runs with 4 lowbies, basically pull entire zombie room and kill entire dungeon for xp, get in 35, get out 50, takes couple hrs, they get payed per hr to do it, and gets all the loot, i dont remember if it was vanila or bc, probably bc
---
To me, you're the one getting defensive. I'm merely pointing that the doomcalling is silly. 
---
"You won't pass MC!!"  
---
Turns into: "You won't pass BWL!!"  
---
Turns into: "You won't pass AQ!!"  
---
Turns into: "You won't pass Naxx!!"
---
And at no point does any of those claiming as much ever try to consider they were wrong.
---
I would say even 6%. RNG of Fear + Lava is fucked.
---
You might need to see a doctor if your ass is green m8.
---
This isn't a charity run. You reserve something you want if you raid lead.
---
Na pve servers are for bittle litches.
---
I use the Logitech software to bind keys to whatever mouse button I want and with the addon "Dominos" (ui addon), you can bind whatever key you want to whatever ability, as long as it's in a action bar.

You don't sound like you're from any side of any pond.

Orb of Deception doesn't work with shadowform, and on top of that the costume it grants only lasts a few minutes. Deviate Delight fish don't work with shadowform either. The Halloween pumpkin treats do work with shadowform, other Halloween costumes/wands do not.
---
tier 1 looks cool on troll and t2 is also fine, its the closed helmets which look stupid on troll male imo
---
troll males are cool, and troll male warrior is definetly unique!!
---
My server orbs are 30g and pbd 20g
---
I’m sorry that you hate the truth.
---
I’m just describing common etiquette, my apologies that it offends you so much. 
---
Never get why you casual care so much about gear you will never utilize to its full potential. 
---
Imagine having your fun tied to gear, grow up man there is much more for his game than specific purples.
---
It's just familiarity with the dungeon. I think most people's first time in ST is that way. But it's basically three circles stacked on top of each other, so once you get the layout it becomes super easy to figure out. Hardest part is remembering which staircases go to which levels.
---
Windserpents auto-attack is melee.
---
/p pri buff
---
I’m not trying to be shitty, waking up to 6 people missing my point completely and calling me a dumbass is pretty annoying though.
---
Yeah, when MC released Hunters had Rend as a 31 point talent.
---
10g for Mara might be cheap, but pendulum for Ulda is insane xD
---
Arms is best for leveling because fury relies so much on +hit gear, which does not exist until the mid 50's. Don't get me wrong, arms is insanely boring and you still miss plenty, but it is more efficient in leveling than fury.
---
Anecdotally, regular cables seem close to 16%
---
A tip is that slam, whirlwind attack (and on lvl 41 mortal strike) gives you an extra melee attack regardless of attack speed.
---
Then I might change it back. Now do you know how to fix it?
---
When I had +4 bows on pants it gave me +.8% hit. Where are you getting +5 = 3%?
---
Defense makes you less likely to get crit by bosses. You need 440 defense (including 300 base at lvl 60) to never get crit. But it's not as important as it was in earlier patches, since boss abilities can't crit anymore, and basic attacks usually aren't threatening enough for a single crit to kill you.
---
You need hit so your taunts don't miss and in to generate more threat in general.
---
Why is it frustrating? Everyone respecs for their raid builds. Arms is still better for leveling and even dungeons, Fury wins out on raid dps.
---
How do I get something reserved? Just by forming a group myself and being an entitled prick?
---
I don't remember this ever being a thing in Vanilla. You rolled and hoped for the best.
---
It's pretty easy to justify. They're a player sacrificing hours of their day just like everyone else. On top of that, they're helping _your guild_ out by joining your raid.
---
I leveled a character in BfA until 88. Classic is way more fun than retail for me.
---
With macros that require a shield, like the one you have listed OP, it always gives me an error that I need a shield equipped even though the macro puts my shield on. It’s like it’s doing it all at once and the sequence is choosing to cast the spell first. Is it because you’re using inventory slots instead of the item names?
---
Free mount
---
furry warriors are basically rogues with a cpl mail pieces sprinkled in
---
I’m lucky. I have a lot of vanilla buddies playing again. But they’re lagging a smidge. I do look forward to the level 60 grind to commence for them too. 
---
I’m gonna keep on keepin on. Don’t you worry. 
---
Westfall for life.
---
When the pvp system comes in, casuals will have an alternative path to getting gear and this exploitative meta will die off properly, as nobody will bother to join such runs. It’s already pretty much happened on my server, just a few ppl spamming to no avail.
---
Do you think it is possibly deliberate due to stuff like mage aoe farming in ZF etc?
---
That's the one. Although my favourite is The Dead Zone. Just waiting for the film to be remade
---
That's true, but like, read his post, man.
---
you should let the mage sheep pull then charge the mobs when they are running towards mage for extra rage.
---
I've actually seen deep ret pallies do pretty wild damage in dungeons.  You might get some shit from min maxing needs though.  Consecration is a must have for tanking, but the aoe damage is so miserable I don't really use it except when I need some aoe threat.
---
Disc with spirit tap until 40. The dps between wand and mind flay isn’t large enough to warrant wasting mana/regen for mind flay.
---
Ya iv asked them to take it to a private channel but it didnt work for some reason. Also warned them about it. They have their own set of rules so no one can be butt hurt if they lose.
---
Ran 8 runs today and saw one book, under the ramp.
---
95 gold nice
---
You can’t believe a tank would sell tanking services? Why wouldn’t he?? Most people would rather pay some gold than wait around 30+ mins finding a tank. It’s a win/win for everybody, unless your the type of person who can’t understand value in services.
---
I've been tanking since the beginning.  Always tell lots of jokes and keep the group feeling light and fun while also just straight up being a beast at what I do.  People always tell me they're adding me to friends and when they see me around in game they always wave or say hi and I'm almost always getting messages being asked to tank things for people both who I've ran with in the past and people who have been told to message me if they need a good tank.
---
I also help people in and out of dungeons, going out of my way to help people get a quest done, especially tricky elite quests that they have trouble with and things like that so I occasionally get little gifts in the mail from people I've helped and that just makes my day.
---
Feels good man.
---
RemindMe! 4 hours
---
Oh boi this post again
---
On average paladin DPS is little lower than Warrior, but they offer a lot of utility to a group: buffs, aura, occasional heal, resurrect if healer dead\resto druid, etc.  
---
On other hand, I don't remember seen retribution paladin past level 30 in dungeons.
---
31 vs Whitemane?
---
I'd expect a better chance of bedding her than hitting her.
---
Make a /pet attack or /pet follow macro and put in a place bound to mousewheel up.
---
I would then put zoom to shift mousewheel up and down so you can still use that.
---
nah you can tank as fury, too.
---
Source: am fury warrior
---
you dont get to complete the quest in a Rend run :D
---
I'm assuming you meant 20 hours a day, but yes you're right, it isn't healthy and it should be addressed, but to be fair, Fav0 worded it in a way that wasn't really kind in anyway. I think that's the main reason this\_is\_4\_work acted the way he did towards him.
---
Can you tell me what ms/OS means? I’ve seen this before but never asked.
---
It's not a nature resist issue. Your pet can survive her AoE just fine, especially if you move it out when she starts that attack and move it back in after.
---
The problem is that the princess does heavy melee damage to anyone in her melee range randomly regardless of who has aggro. So if your pet is dpsing her while you kite she will randomly hit your pet for 30-50% of it's health sometimes. You can get some small bursts of pet dps in during certain cooldown states on the princess but you absolutely cannot have your pet in melee range of her at all times without healing it almost constantly.
---
I look cool in my wolf helm
---
&gt;licklickRickmyballs
---
Lmao.
---
But yeah true.  I'm a tank named Notprotspec so people tend to comment on that and remember it once they see me in action.
---
If you are BM spec Broken Tooth is higher DPM because more uptime on Frenzy.  Beyond that you are correct.
---
What? Nobody is saying that offspeccs cant tank. They are saying that the warrior/pala/druid still have to be willing to tank and most people who are willing to tank have already geared themselves and dont need the dungeons. 
---
Again Fury can tank any dungeon but they dont want to/dont feel comfy enough and thus there is a big lack of tanks. The whole pay for tank is just to get ahead of the queue since a tank can always create a group himself and prolly get it full faster than a 4/5 grp that just needs a tanl
---
You don’t know what you are talking about. There is a massive difference in 5 man’s between a good and bad tank.
---
What you're describing sounds mostly like a lack of communication. For a healer to trust their tank like you're suggesting, it takes a lot of blind faith to just presume that they know what they're doing and will not wipe the party. If you discuss the ideas with the healers then they can more easily understand your ambitions and fall into the role in a way that will make everything go faster.
---
I'm an undead Warlock, and if I got upset every time that a healer wasted their water by standing up to heal me after I life tap to 40% HP to cannibalize a corpse for mana it would be very taxing. Instead, after witnessing them do this the first time I just inform the healer that I'm fine to manage my own hp outside of combat and to focus on drinking to full so they can adequately heal for the next pull. It takes a wise healer to know and understand what I'm up to, and not panic about my HP plummeting; but at the same time it is a foolish healer to just presumes that I am competent enough to not kill myself in this process.
---
I've played plenty of healers over my career, as well as tanks. Knowing your limits and how to play to them as a tank is key to success and speed, but trusting your tank to not kamikaze himself and the rest of the party as a healer is a bit more difficult. When you find those healers that know what they're doing and can actually trust you, those are the ones you want to add to friends list and make note of to group up again.
---
That’s a fair point. For now it’s just PvE though. I have heard that the dot is bad in raids though because it takes up a debuff slot. I mostly run dungeons though so I’m still torn on what’s better.

yes, but I thought it might be a healing effect?
---
If you already have your mount and are getting "spare" gold now, look to buy (or craft) Dreamweave stuff asap (all 3 pieces). It has amazing stats for its level and will easily last you until 60.
---
Lets see, should I:
---
1) Go buck, pull threat from Ony, have her turn my way, wipe half the raid and tail swipe the other into the whelp cave
---
2) OR watch my threat, and stop execute spam
---
Decisions, decisions
---
Thanks for the answer, probably sealed my decision to reroll, fuck queues
---
More like 10 hours at the weekend. I don't play in the week.
---
Forgive my ignorance, but what sort stuff does the gold from guild banks get spent on?
---
It took me 53 Emperor runs to see the caster robe.
---
I would have just farmed for my Robe of the Void, but it was about principle at a certain point. 
---
(And I was helping a buddy get Ironfoe.)
---
Shouldn't black out his name ...  Save the rest of us from his douchebaggery
---
TBC preWTLK patch
---
you had a talent that your execute is available even before 20%
---
when u land a critical strike
---
s4 DW axes with hybrid arms/fury build with over 55% crit
---
spamming whole fight just execute
---
best 2 weeks(of my life) patch ever
---
I didnt really follow any guides, when spring, I guess you are right. I just thought the amount of overhealing done by healers, that a mix of healing and damage prevention would be most optimal
---
BWL is for sure gonna be a rude awakening for people who think classic is a cake walk. It's not hard, but you can't just run in and press buttons. There are actual gear checks and mechanics that can wipe your raid.
---
I'd imagine a lot of guilds will get stuck on razorgore day 1 lol.
---
You CAN upgrade after level 35.   However, I recommend you buy your mount before you train artisan (which costs 5g).  If you're worried about missing out on some skill-ups by not training artisan, dont.  Skinning is by far the easiest gathering skill to level, and you're going to be maxed out at 300 by level 42 easily if you skin all the beasts you come across.
---
u really dort understand classic...
---
the whole "put a Group together" is part of it..
---
Wouldn’t think this is a big deal regardless. Going to try it tonight tho and see
---
Yeah sorry I meant non frenzy specs
---
Warriors would be higher up if people only played Human and Orc.
---
No life and proud of it. gg dude
---
Yes, and I'm questioning it. Which for some reason is offending you greatly.
---
You have fun I guess.
---
Don't wear any leather against the last boss especially switch those pieces out for your tank pieces. Also have a macro/bind ready to switch to 1h and shield when he goes wolf form. Lastly bring some potions even just superior can save your ass from a wipe which sets you back 5 minute so it's worth the tiny amount of gold they cost.
---
I'm in two minds of this.  If it's a dungeon I need, I won't suggest this.  Even if there's one item I could potentially get that's enough for me to go along for the ride.  If, however, the dungeon has nothing to offer me I will ask for stuff like this.
---
Sylvanas killed Varimathras when she realised that tho.Also why they didn't make alliance bad guys for once??
---
Is it just me, or does anyone else not have a problem with relatively minor reserves? If I want an item that has a low drop chance, I don't want to halve that drop chance by competing with another person. If I make my own group, I could either just kick or not invite anyone who has a class that would compete for that item regardless. Publicly saying that an item is reserved simply opens up the number of people who may join your group, so that if a mage wants to join your LBRS run for their quests, they can without you having to fight for skyshroud or hands of power.
---
This is how it should be
---
youre remembering TBC, when everything &lt;60 was complete faceroll
---
It doesnt happen every run but youll know when it happens \^\^
---
Fireball definitely drops aggro and it targets person with highest threat. Best strat is to have OT sit like at #10 threat in p1 and then pop all his cooldowns in p3 and he should be able to pick her up.
---
Its best to use a build that has improved stealth, increased stealth speed, imp sap, decreased vanish cooldown, and preparation. This makes it much much easier as you will have at least two vanishes, and only a cooldown of 3.5 minutes.
---
On the run you also kill the guy who drops firey weapon enchant, and the pugger guy in grim guzzler. Check out video's online to see the rout so you can avoid all dogs. This ends up being 7g - 12g per run, and you can do about 4 - 5 of these an hour if you hit it real hard.
---
play all the nonoptimal specs you want, just dont think you deserve spots in dungeons or raids!
---
My favorite is strat UD “baron cape res”. Yeah if by some miracle the mount drops, I fully expect them to ninja it...never joining a group like that.
---
This is exactly how i approach games and most things in general. Makes life so much more enjoyable.
---
I mean I would be irritated on losing it even the first run. But I wouldn’t think it’s unfair as long as it is an upgrade for the lock. It’s part of the game.
---
Shadow is first tier in pvp
---
My buddy just picked this up. Big crits. Too bad we're alliance.
---
Who specs JUST for raids? When you can have a spec that works great inside of raids and perform really good outside of raids (Open world, dungeons, PvP) or spec for ONLY raids and barely do any more damage since the extra talents you get are trash tier?
---
I think most people would chose to spec enrage.
---
Based on your post, you are the one who has no idea about what Disc in Classic is.
---
Yes OP- Judgment of righteousness is your 'ghetto taunt'.  Does a nice chunk of holy damage and threat is boosted like 3x normal because of righteous fury.
---
Hunters cannot do anything resembling aoe grinding. You can, once every few minutes, kill a large number of weak mobs designed to be AoE killed in dungeons but it takes all of your cooldowns. Hunters are good at chain pulling weak mobs and killing 1 strong mob at a time.
---
It'd be ridiculous to buy it at that price anyway considering it's like, what, 8 spell power more than Band of the Unicorn? Yet it's like 625g-675g more. Waste of gold imo
---
True ... unless warriors all collectively start refusing to tank, which seems to the case in Classic. Tanks are BY FAR the hardest people to find when forming dungeon groups these days.
---
Plus in end game, a well geared warrior can way out dps a cat druid, so many Fury warriors would be very happy indeed to know there's a bear druid that can off tank in their place so they can just spend all their time DPSing which is far less stressful and requires much less attention.
---
Fucking oof
---
Funny, I played holy, and was asked to switch to shadow. Give the meme spec a chance to prove themselves before judging them.
---
You need sound to be viable in pvp tbh
---
Main spec/off spec. Usually you see ms&gt;os which means a person rolling on an item for their main spec will get it over if someone wants it for off spec
---
The only thing that would change my mind about having dual specc in classic is if it had a one cost fee of like 1000g otherwise pass dont need it
---
yeah dude, take the dream team, warrior/rogue/hunter/paladin
---
/petfollow
---
/petattack
---
&gt; Any PvP on top of the *mage* is reportable and bannable.
---
You can't tell me I can't PvP while crushing and stepping on gnome mages?
---
Yes, but it’s situational. Shields aren’t as efficient. But you are right you need to watch overhealing. Easiest way to do that is, when someone is at 90%, their hours is “full”. You’re less likely to over heal and actually utilize all your mana. But yeah you actually need to heal
---
If I’m near the area they are asking for help, I’ll usually pop over and see what I can do, but a lot of the times people just complain in general chat without saying where they are.
---
So the quest enchants have nothing to do with the enchanting profession, I think pretty much all of the quest enchants are available with just some Naxx consumable enchants not available.
---
The reputation enchantments that you learn and use with the enchanting skill are set to come out in phase 3 and are very valuable like bonus agility to weapons.
---
Lol you need the axe either way dude.
---
Arms is great for leveling.
---
Fury sucks until you can get some +hit and dual wield around level 49.
---
Source: lvl 51 warrior
---
Horrible idea. Take pride in your spec.
---
Yeah I think once I have the stairs better understood it should be quite a bit faster.
---
Only HIGH PERFORMING players who have taken their talent choices from APPROVED GUIDES are allowed to play with me because we're really struggling to down MC at the moment.
---
Wait
---
Why is Blizzard moving away from talent trees? My choices!!!
---
(If you can't successfully raid with the odd person playing off meta then the issue isn't them)
---
The question is why would people run that dungeon without reserving it? 
---
Just create your own groups if it bothers you so much.
---
Do you have to be exalted with darnassus as well for the tiger riding skill?
---
A good Ret is making up for their lower damage with EXTREME AMOUNTS OF UTILITY. A bad ret is just bad. 
---
What's fun about Ret? Seal of Command proccing can lead to insane burst damage. They're absolutely a blast in PvP once geared, and it's a really thematically fun class.
---
I usually just walked by watching the idiots kill each other while I go kill quest mobs. Then I got my mount at 40 and *ran* by them watching them kill each other.
---
Lol
---
Im at around 24ish?  18 days at 60...Fury warrior with full prebis Lionheart/Ony tooth pendant and a pretty decent tank set..
---
Working on NE rep to get myself a tiger atm.
---
Just go to key bindings and bind it from there. That’s what I did.
---
I honestly can't imagine a single person who thinks MC is fun tbh. But gl to this guy
---
God I hate those 2 tick veins ! At least you get the chance to drop some gems !
---
Who's this streamer? I'd like to check him out.
---
one rare exception does not change the general rule.
---
Want dual spec, play retail. Vanilla didn't have duel spec, don't cry because classic doesn't.  Why do play continue to try to change classic??
---
So make an alt...
---
lots of folks are talking in-game about how 6-piece shadowcraft for rogues is actually out-dps'ing full t1+t2. But I haven't actually been able to find an article or post or anything about it. Is this just trolling, or is there something substantial here?
---
Oof!
---
Gameplay montages like that have not aged well for me.
---
I used to think they were the coolest thing! But now it's just cringetopia for me for some reason XD
---
Well if we assume that Ambush and Backstab crit, we can also assume that Windfury procs, I crit 3 times, AND Earth Shock crits, right?
---
Jokes aside, initial threat is a problem for all tanks, that's not unique to Shaman
---
(I understand you are joking)
---
I do agree there should be no, or very few, changes to the base game, because I know some people want it to be as close to classic as possible, but I enjoy some of the QOL changes retail brought, so I'm glad there's add-ons that let me have what I want, but it's not forced on people who don't want it.
---
this has been debated multiple times, not able to find the post, but its 100% Sunder.
---
That music is pure fuckin garbage! Sorry.
---
It is though?
---
No spot in grps. Only a select few hunters get raid spots. Bad dps. Bad scaling. No utility besides kiting a few bosses.
---
Removing hunters ability to solo grind removes the last reason to play the class.
---
u mean your ex-girlfriend?
---
I think you have the wrong view on what a disc priest is on classic.
---
Any have an good addons for raid frames?  I have grid2 but can get it set up how I want.  Can't recall for the life of me how I did it back in the day.
---
Yeah i recycled the textures from the "reborn ui v2.0 " i had  since vanilla.
---
Eh captain rune and Blackstone ring are both available around 49. Grab those 2% quest reward shoulders and fury is viable at 50.
---
You don't "have to". But, you should, which is why I'm switching between Thrash Blade, Lord General's, and the hatchet. 
---
1.7 speed should not be underestimated.
---
You have full pre-bis if you are comparing Dalrends to  Quell'serrar+Mihras's song. When in full pre-bis they still sim higher even without world buffs, but the gap is really small.
---
I feel you man. My girlfriend likes to go to bed early and I know that going for a dungeon after dinner is a risky endeavour.
---
Fortunately I work from home a lot and whenever I have a low workload I make up for it.
---
If the enemy is level-appropriate, I'd go fight. Stuff like that is why I rolled on pvp server. Fighting for territory with a pickup group is much more fun that questing in any case.
---
Very possible
---
You don’t have to want dual spec, but this is an absurd argument. Take pride in your spec? Give me a break.
---
Ony isn't even fucking hard for 20 people, 30+ will easily do, and you got TWO Ony runs per week, so if you can't organize a full Ony raid atleast ONCE per week with the raid for the head buff for next MC run, you need to work on getting more people in the guild itself before doing anything
---
The only item I'll remotely just wish cancer on you for reserving, and not death, is the rag eye. That's because giving that to a pugger who will never get enough money to even make it.
---
Ahh, the machine I use my PIN number in right?

---
&gt;This era we life in for gaming is a dark age. Everything needs to be monetized and maximum profit.
---
For MMOs maybe, but anyone who thinks this about gaming in general needs to put down the AAA junk food and look a bit harder; there is a huge quantity of amazing games out right now.
---
I'm that lvl 36 warrior that gets rooted every 5 minutes, but I will return and have my revenge......
---
Is it just the gold or do you roll as well?
---
Glad to hear I'm not crazy. Wondering why I never see warriors using sunder over heroic though.
---
Cool in theory, but too much of a hassle to enforce in practice, just for the measly payoff of making your shadowpriest more efficient (a spec which most people are skeptical of and not super willing to accommodate).
---
Maybe you didn't have a son 15 years ago?
---
You don't need prot spec to warrior tank just a gear set. Our main tanks aren't even prot spec.
---
no, just because you rushed everything in 2 months doesn't mean the game should be dumbed down, this mentality got us retail...
---
9.5 gold nice
---
All pets within a family (i.e cats, wolfs, gorillas) have normalised damage in Classic WoW. It's the same dps regardless of the varying attack speed (if the player isn't deep BM).
---
Tl;dr - For PVE pick any pet you want as long as you have max ranks off the ability to level it. For PVP you want broken tooth, but it honestly doesn't matter much.
---
I don’t remember what the fee was, but this is how dual spec was originally.
---
Mobs &amp; Bosses have high Fire Res in MC, and Baron + Rag are completely immune to fire. That being said tho, if you enjoy dungeons, and are interested in fire, I'd highly recommend testing it. I've been playing fire the past week, even managed to get to 21% fire crit unbuffed with the right items. Had a blast, outdealing everyone I've played with in dungeons except for some rogues. Never met a frostmage that got close to me, 100dps or more below me on the overall for a dungeon. Correctly setting up Combustion is also pretty fun, 2k+ dps on dog groups in DMN e.g. - your survivability however is very limited due to not having Barrier or Block for resets.

Had this happen to me while tanking a 5 man Jed/Rend. Ele shammy (claiming to be resto) was pre casting chain lightning before every pull and wondering why he was pulling agro.
---
Go figure, he pulls agro on Gyth, breaths the entire group while I’m ice blocked and gets 1 shot. “Why did you breath the raid!?”, he screams in party. I don’t give him the courtesy of a response because I can tell the type of player he is. Thanks to consecutive last stand then shield wall We managed to kill Gyth but Rend had his way with us.
---
Find out later he’s in a guild known on the server for ninja-ing loots during PUG MCs. Needless to say, he now has a very negative review in my character notes add on (may be the best add on I have lol).
---
Madseasonshow is incredible. As soon as his theme music hits it's a relaxing deep dive into nerdy nostalgia
---
No, it uses base cast time. If it worked that way, those talents would be awful since they'd nuke your mana efficiency.
---
I avoid STV like the plague corpse walking there takes days

They're sold because they're requested.  Demand creates a market.
---
Phase 2 is not half way out......  
---
Plese get that out of your head.  
---
Phase 2 is Honour system.... nothing more...  
---
When Phase 3 will be ouot, there will still be guild going for MC and Ony, so nothing worry about.  
---
Also P servers have there been for 15 years, and still people didnt miss out... so realy nothing to worry about.
---
What does the documentation say on guilds of people that have played together for 15 years? What about for guilds that don't really care that much about PvE content, and therefore won't get frustrated as much at not being server firsts?
---
What about clearing content that was maybe considered challenging 15 years ago but that is now seen as mechanically trivial nowadays?
---
Details does count shields, so does warcraftlogs. I have imp shield talent, so assign myself to shield in specific cases like Gedon bomb targets since they los healers in our placement. Found they drop like flies unless I pop out to shield them.
---
Hope you get well pretty soon. There are places where they would love to help you if you ever need it.

[May 2006. Druid 60 in SM Arm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITJRLhsGMIY)
---
Seems consistent with current classic. Herold was consistently hitting for an average of 250 and none of the Scarlet Trainees at the end missed any of their attacks for 15-20 damage each.
---
No, for the purposes of calculating spellpower coefficients, the base (not affected by any talents or other abilities) cast time of a spell is used.
---
*pulls pat while healer is drinking*
---
*takes 10% hp damage because you are tanky as shit whole fight*
---
healer: WAIT FOR MANA REEEEEEEEEE
---
The regular ones always fill, people who want those items don’t join it. The people who don’t will.
---
If a tank wants plate armour, they simply get a group of mail/cloth players.
---
If a healer wants caster boots, they simply bring along physical damage players.
---
Lol I’m not saying he’s right I’m just trolling
---
PVP happened on a PVP server
---
Haven't been at home yet to test, but this looks awesome. 
---
One question: would it be possible (or is it, in case I'm uninformed) to generate loot tables for each mob type that was farmed? Basically just a tab where you see the calculated drop percentages based on your own farming progress. It should't be hard to do, just adding a tab that divides the number of obtained items by the number of total kills (same thing with the gold values). 
---
It would be amazing to have a tool that could act as a method to verify wowhead loot statistics and give the farmers an easy way to decide which mob type to go for based on your own farming history.
---
Only slam resets swing timer and it's only valuable if you have a very slow weapon and very fast fingers. Great for boss DPS.
---
MS and WW arent extra attacks they just dont disrupt the swing timer
---
Why solo SM when you can solo ZF and DMN/E
---
Ye in wotlk and was like 100g or something, 1000g in classic is alot of money and to have such a thing should cost alot
---
Dead realm probably, alot of people leveling alts atm
---
Everyone has leveled past you, and no one has started alts yet. Empty starting zones are to be expected for a while.
---
But what's the benefit of skilling disc? I could heal everything as shadow just fine and I have the possibility of dealing a little more damage if necessary.
---
I agree, people are using the word need incorrectly.  Noone needs epic boes.  On the scale of greed --&gt; need I would rank getting an epic mount way above epic boes because they actually save time.  Nobody is entitled to tradeable goods.
---
Yeah I'm also puzzled by that. You could keep them on passive and use the skill manually to keep them at range, but with a 20 yard range that seems kind of awkward.
---
As I understand it, they're good because Lightning Breath is the only pet ability that scales with gear. This was nerfed in patch 2.0, but should still be in Classic: https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=25012/lightning-breath#comments
---
Most likely the only overtake cats in DPS in later tiers, with better gear + the final rank of Lightning Breath in ZG.
---
go offline on battle net Chatt... that way you only got your own friend list on that realm right?
---
They are, but I'm far more interested in PvP, so I run Ass/Sub in PvE.
---
I'm trying to apologize and explain myself, who hurt you?
---
It says it's more likely to not break and it also says that you're clearly not the majority and when people make broad statements they're not specifically talking about edge cases for which it obviously doesn't apply. 
---
I also doubt you have been playing with the same *forty* people for the past 15 years and it only takes 1/3, sometimes even less, of the raid to quit for the guild to break. Then it turns into a race between the people you're frantically trying to recruit and the people you're bleeding out, leading to less recruit quality to favor quantity which only exacerbates the issues that caused the guild to struggle in the first place, which in turn pushes people out even faster until the GM and officers burn out and quit.
---
No one's talking about server firsts. I'm talking about guilds that will be hardstuck on vael for 5 weeks in a row.
---
I have created 5 characters now but I always struggle to reach lvl 20 before deciding my current character isnt good enough/what i want to play and then I make a new character. 
---
Is there something I'm doing wrong? I really want to progress in the game but then I realise I invested in the wrong perk tree or something else and I start all over again.
---
Lol same! Didn’t read at all just giving my downvote to the dumbass idea of dual classes in classic.
---
i have the blue one
---
https://i.redd.it/26nsk1qdbxt31.jpg
---
i go Blue or White
---
for the most people its too soon for alt
---
I thought this was a joke post at first. Yikes...
---
Hybrid specs become nullified.  Specs become an unimportant decision-you can now tank and DPS equally well, so there's no character specialisation - your character is no longer a fury warrior, he's just another warrior.
---
You don't have to agree, but there's already a wow game where you can change specs at will.  Why can't we have a game where it's actually a choice (like a real RPG game)?
---
Lionheart Helm doesn't get replaced for a century though, Freezing Band (when paired with the Save Princess quest ring) is pretty easily replaced
---
When are they releasing pvp
---
The wowgold invites are fucking annoying
---
Pretty much. The true value of classic is that it's an environment that produces meaningful plater interactions, which is more important than the game itself. If you want the opposite you know where to go.
---
You should have just learned your place, mortal.
---
Most of the main wave is probably high 40s at this point, and being a french server means youre likely low population.
---
**&lt;Bread&gt; Fairbanks US - Horde PvP**
---
Relatively small guild looking to start raiding by next Tuesday. Raid times at the moment are Tuesday/Wednesday 6-930 PST but are subject to change based on members' availability.
---
Until we have a solid 40-man raid team we will be rolling out the usual +1 MS&gt;OS, free roll BoEs which will be closely monitored by guild officers that are present.
---
Mixed experience as far as Vanilla and naughty servers go - some have raided as far as Naxx, others have pushed rank 12-13 in PvP. We will be putting an emphasis on both facets of the game as content becomes available and would like to provide a home for everybody.
---
Feel free to contact husbando#6034 on Discord or Weakling / Mediumrare / Nigmalol / Heratiks in-game with any questions you might have or ultimately for an invite.
---
So let's say I want to play tank for a few dungeons during the week but I am a fury warrior in the guild and cant get a tank spot in raids. I don't see why having the option to switch back and forth between two specs would hurt the game.
---
Funny, I am a night elf but I am grinding SW rep like crazy because for me elves look better on horses lol.
---
G O B A C K T O R E T A I L
---
To be fair, the Onyxia res on there is 100% logical, a quest item and progression raiding equipment.
---
I think you might need an intervention, man...
---
It was added for TBC, since both factions get Paladins and Shamans with the new TBC races.
---
I remember hearing about Shamans being pink in Vanilla, but started in early TBC.
---
You got downvoted for a reason. Because the way you asked the question was not normal.
---
So, wich rotation do you use?^^
---
They're not at 50% - his point is that max rank heals often overheal even if the dps is that low. So you need lower ranks on your bars of Heal and Greater Heal for those situations.
---
Why wouldn't there be people at lvl 20 ? People have a job/school/other game to play or i don't know, it seems strange to me that there is no other player at low level only 2 months after the game release D:
---
I think it would work, but wouldn't be stable - due to lag spikes and pathing errors, the circle would slowly collapse until people would stop walking.
---
I don't think anyone is crying because they don't get a buff that is pretty minor.
---
/r/ThatHappened
---
Black stone ring is a myth. That shit didn’t drop in 10 runs of Mara. And I’m not bitter! Fuck Mara
---
Be extremely careful about tanks that want all non-upgrades: I was doing scholo as a healer in one of these groups (and I didn't need a single item for main spec from that dungeon), and I asked before hand if I could roll on feral off spec gear, and they said yes. Then, nothing at all drops until the second to last boss, and shadowcraft bracers drop, and I needed, but obviously the tank and his warlock friend needed too, so ended up wasting an hour for jack shit.
---
If you join one of these groups, make sure to type out a list of every single item that you will need on or you will get fucked over
---
Disagree completely. 
---
The 50g it costs to respec is part of the gold sink of classic. It is NOT hard to farm up 50g to respec, and if someones too lazy to do that well tough.
---
Quick cap right before shutdown

I'm aware that you don't need it, but it would make it more fun and also a lot easier to tank efficiently. I am full pre-bis tank and still struggling to keep aggro because people deal insane damage at this point.
---
where have you been for a month
---
Kalimdor’s Revenge tho.
---
This is not normal. The hit penalty even in PvP should be substantial.

The hunter was a moron but vanilla pallys can't really tank

This has all swords ranked in regards to MH and OH.

someone came out under their rock I see
---
This is actually pretty interesting. Nice
---
Definitely Crusader from the Scarlet mobs south of Hearthglen.
---
Yea, I downloaded ElvUi and some addon called Benik for Elvui. Then you log in and setup both, easy.
---
IDK about Shadowcraft vs T1 but I doubt it. In either case I don't think a single Shadowcraft piece is pre-raid BIS.
---
Cmon man, people have been doing these raids for 10 years.
---
Well, poor mr fury warrior needs all the gear created for you. And you can’t run without a tank.
---
Double rogue is also possible.
---
Just go to pve servers? If people are really going to get that upset about a mechanic of the game, they can go to servers where it is taken out. I do see what you’re saying though, the people more unfamiliar with it, and the more casual player might get put off from playing if they’re getting grave ganked. To that end I’ll say this, why be on pvp server if you weren’t expecting to get ganked when honor kills drop? [Masahiro Sakurai understand what I mean](https://youtu.be/u6tvzG_88sU)

Mage here. Did 18 princess runs to get all my loot. Saw the ring about 3 times.
---
If you have a shield on you can force revenge procs by using shield block, i think it's still better threat/ rage than sunder while also blocking dmg.
---
I think this was the follow up raid after they cleared stormwind in like under 10 minutes
---
I am totally unconcerned with most pre-raid BiS. However as a mage there are lots of pieces that don't even get replaced in raid so kinda need to get those sooner rather than later.
---
Pick mobs that are profitable and have a loot table that you like. Knowing that the mobs all have a low chance of dropping mooncloth goes a long way.
---
Why Arcane for PvE?
---
If dps is missing a small chunk of hp ill throw a renew on him and forget , you do need to keep one lower rank heal ready but downranking 24/7 is counter productive .
---
I paid 160g for devilsaur set already made on the AH, must have gotten lucky
---
I did the exact same grind as you and went with the blue Stormsaber. I do not regret it, looks amazing!
---
\&gt; we now have even more of an uneven playing field 
---
Get glasses.
---
I don't remember if it was in vanilla but in TBC paladins had a "fear undead" ability that would work on forsaken in PVP  ,  it was amazing and hilarious since it was basically it's ONLY use because i can't recall ever using it in PvE.
---
I can see you haven't looked at realm lists in a while
---
Just did a /who for Barrens on my server, there are currently 25 people there between lvls 10-30 (and this is on a US server during morning).
---
You might be on a dead server.
---
You forgot the slowpoke meme
---
Also works on bats/griffs/riders
---
BoPs *literally* have a uniform market price in their vendor value that is the same across all players.
---
Nope but, it's nice to be the exception. Let's go ahead and say f everyone who plays what they want for fun. If you join a guild and they are forcing a spec on you, that's probably not a guild for you. The game is 15 years old you pay your own sub play it your way. Will all groups take you no, but if you play you spec well people tend to remember you and want you in their groups. Relax a bit have fun noone should be on "progression" in this game, will you need to swap to a different spec as needed, sure, I've already stated I expect to be holy for raid and to pump me some holy gear over shadow gear. Show you are willing to go the extra miles and the right guild will work with you.
---
If you're on a PvP server, there's world PvP and Honor at Phase 2.  If you're on a PvE server, I believe there's no PvP for you until Phase 3, which will likely be around January.  (This is a completely educated guess, please do not quote me on this.)
---
This isn't new? Honestly first time i've noticed this
---
You think respeccing keeps the economy in check? Lol.
---
Let’s focus on the class thing. You say they would lose identity. How?
---
How would having access to say an arms build and a prot build as a warrior make me have less identity than having a trip to the trainer in between? You always have the ability to make that change and flippantly swap from one build to another. I’ve never felt class identity was connected to my specific talent point combination, but rather tied to my actual class.
---
Fuck the life of the warrior.
---
Hunter / rogue can’t even do runs fast because loot horny fury warriors have everything on reserve.
---
\&gt; Most leveling dungeons get skipped by people who wants to level efficiently.   
---
By 10% of the population - maybe.
---
Ah the windows explorer user
---
There's like 35 people in Barrens between level 12-25 on my server. So probably yours is dead.
---
But that is exactly the case in retail wow. How is giving people more options a bad thing? It's essentially giving people more things to do with minimal impact on the overall game - the way I see it atleast.
---
How do I tank in classic? Currently I’m specced Arms. Level 30 warrior. Can I tank in arms for a bit? Would I have to respec? When do you have to go sword and board? Any resources I can check out? I was a 24/7 tank in retail but I’ve never played classic and I’m a little intimidated.
---
Am I the only one that doesn't get these?
---
Should I respec from shadow priest to holy at 55 or wait until 60?
---
I want to heal in raids so I know the 21/30/0 holy build is inevitable, I’m just wondering if respecting early will affect my last stretch of leveling (specifically if I’m mostly solo questing with occasional dungeons).
---
Lol this is a really tame conversation to think couldn't happen
---
Thanks for your feedback, very productive :)
---
https://i.imgur.com/rCAhKgN.png
---
I think it just uses linear scaling? So 3% at equal levels and then goes up by some % per level. You should definitely miss higher lvl players but not too often.
---
I've grouped with two so far.  Both were entertaining dudes.  Druids tend to be pretty chill.
---
How long do catholic blessings last?
---
you get a ton of runecloth grinding this out so that also helps
---
Can I get that prebis list too please?
---
Well we know what’s not going to get sucked tonight now.
---
Frostsaber is best, now go back grinding !
---
You do have the option
---
Go to any major city
---
Ask a guard where to find your class trainer
---
Right click the class trainer
---
They will give you the option to respec
---
And now you can pick any spec you want. You get all 51 talent points back to spend in any way you want
---
Nah dude. You’re wrong. Head to Magey’s discord where real theorycrafting happens, and you’ll see it’s not. It’s too slow, and it’s proc rate is absolute dog shit in classic compared to pservers. I’d rather use Mirah’s than IF. lol
---
It kills community and social aspects of the game.
---
Yes, it would be lovely if a holy priest could click a button to go shadow to farm between raids, but having people """trapped""" as healers keeps many things alive - such as dungeon farming for gold, keeping professions relevant, cooperative farming. 
---
If everyone can take care of all their own pve and resource needs quickly and efficiently, then people just raidlog and/or live in their own bubble.
---
Lol I love it.
---
We have 12 mages in MC.  The meter is an ocean of blue with a lone warrior on top.  When that bitch hits 20%, afterburners ensure the race is over.
---
Pretty sure they don't give XP ever, but could be wrong
---
Farm the elementals at fire plume ridge for elemental and essence of fire
---
Lmao this is well done
---
As a tank if I'm doing one of these runs I wait to roll last. If everyone greeds/passes, I need roll, if I see a need roll and it makes even the remotest of sense (ex a lock rolling on leather wouldn't make sense) I let them have it
---
Are you aware that crossroads is a very common thing?  Like you don't need to find a piece of cheese and be like look cheese is in wow!
---
I believe just judgement procs from consc not the seal, and I think the timer from consc is independent of your auto attack (but not sure).
---
Also worth considering is judgement of Wisdom generates more threat than an non-crit judgement of Righteousness.
---
For a non-shit group of 4 mages and 1 priest, yes. It's crazy good exp. Maybe more like 90-100k though.
---
There's a pretty simple way to resolve this: never run reserved dungeons.
---
Alternatively, and my favorite choice, call them out publicly and start your own run.
---
Well, I never said no changes :) I actually hope they change a lot of things as time goes by. The classic feeling is great, and so is the content - but a lot of classic is also litteral garbage and should be changed for the better. I think everyone realizes this, but the majority has their mind set on "no changes".
---
JoL/oW will tick on the first Conc tick, with regards to the RNG nature of those judgements.
---
With 30 second JoL/oW's it's nearly impossible to go OOM if you have 4 or more mobs.
---
What a bullshit response, lol. I’m playing devils advocate for the sake of a discussion and the best you can come up with is “Classic is not for you.” 
---
All I’m saying is that I don’t feel like my identity as warrior is locked into my specific talent build, and that changing that talent build by a point doesn’t result in some drastic identity change in my class and how I play.
---
I'm sceptical too, because if it's his gf, shouldn't there be more messages? Looks like only 3 have been sent between them.
---
Ehh :P
---
The social interaction is what people want. Nobody wants to be auto matched with anyone else. I have been loving the manual search for group. Every time I find a good group of guys that know their class I friend them and they friend me. All about the networking aspect and loving it. My character friends list has about 40 names, and I always message quite a few of them when putting together groups with good results. 
---
Just gotta enjoy the networking aspect of the game as much as you can.
---
I work 6 days a week and i almost have 2 60s
---
I mean considering the drop rate i don’t think it’s that crazy. Esp since i’m not taking any of the other drops from the dungeon
---
I dunno why they wouldn't use recklessness themselves if they're so anal about it. One way to do both is to keep your agony up until they're about run away in fear, then stick recklessness on them so they don't run. But that kinda sucks for damage because you're likely to clip your strongest agony ticks that way. so i dont think youre wrong for telling them off.
---
handyredditapp
---
I think you misread a little bit of the quest text, while you do get the scroll from a member of the Twilight's Hammer it's because they know how to use/abuse old god power and Myzrael was corrupted by the old gods. When you summon her to kill her she even calls you a fool for helping her before you beat her ass back down.
---
Grats! I wish Horde had something similar. That Un'goro Raptor looks 10 times worse than this.
---
You can play in a normal server.
---
You can just equip a shield and maybe keep a few items that are better for tanking as a tank set if you wish. I'm low 50s on my warrior as arms and still tanking fine.
---
I already had details and I was dealing more dps
---
During leveling use your most damaging spells. Only during raids will you need to use your ability curses. Lock main here and he was prolly just looking at his meter tbh, like a loser. CoA a target that he didn’t put CoA on and corrupt, then corrupt everything else then wand them down. Or RoF if there’s a mage with you.
---
Yes absolutely, making social connections with people who can play at the same time as me, befriending tanks, and all that comes with it. That is a big part of the experience.
---
We have to be. We deal with all the shit. Tank, heals, dps... Sometimes all at once!
---
that's far from the 100g+/h that the above poster claimed was possible for all DPS. it's actually only possible for a few classes.
---
As I said in another comment, lower ranks of Heal or GHeal are far more efficient choices for healing up your dps. Stop using Renew so much - it's a bad habit. It's a good skill in some situations but it should not be bread and butter ever.
---
Exactly this.  All of this.  I've always played a Hunter because I don't much like playing with other people, and everything you said allows me to do most things solo.  That said - I am in a Guild, so I stick to running things with them and always make sure to remind people who invite that I'm not used to playing with other people, so if they have specific Huntard gripes/requests/suggestions to speak up.  I also don't get offended when someone says they'd rather take someone more experienced with them.   This way, they don't end up annoyed and I don't end up in full-blown panic attack mid-dungeon because I'm fucking up.
---
Yeah that’s fine by me, i don’t want to tank the thing in the first place, so they can find someone else. Win-win
---
I see all these people who have done 50+ runs of something. How long do these take? Do you have a job? How long have you been 60? It just seems crazy.
---
I don't think there's a single dungeon I've done over 10 times yet.
---
One nice thing about that curse is that the mobs won't run away at low HP.
---
Why that would be needed at your level I have no idea.
---
spamming shields and renews and were at full mana...something doesnt add up.
---
Why would you think there would be more drama with a reserve group?
---
The only drama that comes from reserving loot seems to happen on Reddit and not in the actual game. I would actually think that reserving would prevent drama as it usually attend from ambiguity over rolling for loot, which reserving would partially eliminate.
---
Thats also true , you could even take the blessed recovery for wpvp if you need filler talent , because both imp renew and inspiration just dont bring that much utility anyway
---
Sword only means, you need 3% more hit
---
Slam is 1,5 cast and a good arms weapon has 3,5 or more swing speed making slam a "half extra attack" for 15 rage. Imo better than heroic strike. 
---
But ms and ww aren't extra attacks? Sure they use a global cool down, but if they don't disturb the swing timer, how can it not be extra attack?
---
I just respecced into prot from arms the other day at 57 - which I don't even think is necessary, I just think it makes things eassier if you plan on farming dungeons.
---
To me, it seems like the most important skill you have is revenge. Hit it any time you're able to. Secondly, tab target to spread revenge/sunders across mobs. One thing that helps a whole lot is marking targets - I have a button on my mouse that's bound to skull, I press shift and it's bound to X, and I press control and it's bound to crescent.
---
I usually tell the DPS that I'm prioritizing skull-&gt;x-&gt;crescent (and crescent usually works for sheep/CC if your party is underleveled). I do the best I can to maintain threat on all but if skull goes onto DPS at 25% and they're actually single targeting it's usually worth it to just go to the next mob in your priority list.
---
I've heard that sweeping strikes is pretty good for tanking in dungeons but I never really had enough rage or stuck in B stance long enough to be able to use it. 
---
Last thing - the talent in arms where you maintain rage while stance dancing is a must. Usually charge-&gt;D Stance-&gt; Demo shout-&gt;sunder/revenge your first mob and keep going.
---
Hope that helps a bit.
---
Once in a while you might find a group that's short and will take you.  But most of the time you're gonna be sitting in ironforge/orgrimmar while everyone else is out doing stuff.  Grats I guess?  The game is 15 years old, and we known what works and doesn't, and meme specs are meme specs for a reason.  Classic wow is classic wow, warts and all.  I don't think it's right that there are specs that are just useless, but I didn't make the game and that's how it was.
---
Curious, is edgemasters any good for an enhance sham raiding or is this just a mortal sin I’m reading
---
It never goes to the surface. But u/illutian mentioned the bot probably has the Hydrocane.
---
What are the mechanics behind lava jumping? How am I supposed to time it so I don't get hurt? I currently just spam jump.
---
Druid : (some people could see this as an advantage) you will always be assigned to the role you did not come for. 
---
When I want to heal, people ask me to tank. When I want to tank, people ask me to heal. When I want to DPS, people laugh.
---
Just a guess, but I think if classic was still available in its original form from when it launched in 2004 people would still be playing it in 2019. Without the classic revamp.
---
In this case. As with all post like this. It is.
---
Devils advocate. Tough to know just how much armor that mage has.
---
Not every pack can be charged into. Ideally I'd charge, Thunder clap, switch stances to defensive, then pull back while the mage sheeps.
---
SoR does proc most other things, maybe not all but things like fiery weapon and judgements do.
---
Yes but I think there is a cooldown before you can get level again
---
Dungeons are probably the best way as you do a lot of 'get two birds stoned at once' with grinding XP / some quests while also going for preraid gear. 
---
If you're soloing stick to doing mostly green/yellow quests as you will tear thru mobs much quicker as a solo warrior.  However the higher level zones are pretty well populated and as a solo warrior you're easy bait in world PVP, soooooo good luck with that
---
I think it's called a Gnomish Discombobulator but I'm not 100% sure
---
Swamp of sorrows
---
Not in vanilla
---
So whos the father?
---
poor XN
---
Spamming the LFG channel with "LF TANK AND HEALER JED/RED RUND DR SET AND BRIAR RESERVED NEED KEY" means they aren't raiding either, though.
---
I think it just refreshes the duration. It does a resist check every few seconds which can cause it to break early, but recasting only matters if it reaches the end of its duration.
---
Yes, unless it's Intimidating Shout or Scare Beast. The former is physical while the latter is nature.
---
Well if you keep those 2 lvl difference in mind, and you were still superior than you already have your answer.
---
No you made healing harder for the other healers, shields are mana inefficient and pretty much shit.
---
I buy all mats and craft them into pots on the spot. Much faster way to make gold if you ask me
---
Comments are usually on the quest, not on the quest item though.
---
Grobbulus is way more populated than any RP-PvE server in NA, for sure. DD is "dead" but it was DOA since it came out a day late, and Grob never had the population issues that the super overpop PvP servers had so people never had to flee.
---
The main tanks in my guild had no problem farming 1100g for quel'serrar. They farm the same amount of gold as anyone else, just in different ways. Mind you, litteraly anyone can pick up mining and herbalism and make as much gold as anyone else. This isn't about gold farming, it's about giving people access to playing their characters the way they want, when they want.
---
Focus on getting your hit cap at the detriment of defense.
---
Hit means you'll miss less, and so generate more overall threat.
---
Defense is very irrelevant for the time being if your healers are decent.
---
Horde Rogue here. Wrote his name down for KoS.
---
Yes, you can tank in Arms.  I'm 49 and working towards 31/5/15.  Currently 31/5/4.  I've tanked all the instances I've run.  
---
Here are some tools/ideas for how to get it done:
---
* Be prepared with a decent 2H and also a decent shield/1H.  Threat will be easier with the 2H but you will survive better with the 1H/shield.  Gauge the group and communicate with your healer to figure out what fits best for the current party.  
---
* Check out the Fight Club discord and macro most of your skills.  Start with Charge and Hamstring to convince yourself that it's worth it.  
---
* Mark a Skull to die first minimally.  If you have gogogogo DPS or even a good player who happens to do a ton of damage, only spend minimal time on Skull.  Build aggro on everything else and let the DPS melt Skull.  If you can hold Skull also, great, but be prepared to let this go.  
---
* Use LOS a lot.  You're 30, so SM is going to be your home for the next 12 levels.  There are lots of corners in SM.  Use them to group the mobs.  Consider getting a weapon chain for SM armory also.
---
* Get the Whirlwind Axe as soon as humanly possible.
---
* As far as skill use goes, sunder and revenge will be your big threat builders, and then Whirlwind at 36 if you end up 2H tanking.
---
It has no threat at all. You really shouldn't be using more than two pieces when things like Brigam girdle, savage glad, eldritch reinforced, etc pieces all exist. I am only using deathbone leggings atm. I have edgemasters for +7 and I have 4% hit already and just about 15% crit and 12% dodge, parry, and block
---
It looks like they made a broader change to how aggro tables work on mobs that are linked on pulls. This also changes some other more relevant farms like the hunter DM solo tribute
---
As a Tauren on a Kodo this hurts :(
---
&gt;what do you expect them to use? Their BiS?
---
If you notice the bar on the right side of the screen he’s pulling the messages up and then SS.
---
Apparently you want to time it so that the lava tick lines up with the height of your jump. Takes a bit of practice but you can avoid the lava dmg if you time it right.
---
Wait until Classic Wrath.
---
Police car, thats what happend
---
You don\`t need to deliver a killing blow. Just start channeling.
---
Beautifully said
---
Well those suck, arena is where its at
---
It’s different because it’s need before greed, if you are mining then presumably you are using the ore for something you need in either blacksmithing or engineering. Rouge locking picking the chest is just going to vendor/ah a bunch of stuff.
---
I 100% disagree with you. I dont want dual specs, cos I want folk to be invested in the talent tree they choose. Healers who improve at healing or tanks who know what they are doing. 
---
If you introduce dual specs, next will be all kinds of whiney improvements we have in retail. 
---
Thats not what folk asked for in classic, so in my opinion, we shouldnt get anything that wasnt in vanilla.
---
A good spriest won't bother to flay on you unless he's snuck up on you. Instead he'll pw:s, pounce around like an idiot until he gets a blackout proc on rank 1 sw:p and then rape you. :D Honestly, there is no better 1v1 class in the game -- between stun, fear, silence, pw:s, and the huge damage reduction in shadow form they have answers for most other classes.
---
Looks like he's scrolling to not leak other messages, check how tiny the scroll icon is.
---
its just that there is item optimization and general balance that makes certain classes (enh shamans) total garbage. If you want to play a pvp spec, you shouldnt expect to get into pve content. Arms warrior is included. You cannot mortal strike bosses, knocking off other debuffs and expect a spot in a raid just because you are having fun hitting big numbers.
---
You people are so entitled.
---
Every race besides humans and orcs still have their own language as well
---
You happen to know how to turn it black like that? I use bartender already but its not black.
---
Hope you find other game to please you then. Outer worlds is coming out i heard. And ofc there is RDR2 coming on PC
---
Good advice! I am really happy with my UI overall now.
---
This belongs in the Classic wow plus sub
---
That's an easy fix; play Horde.
---
To add on, Dragonbreath Chili may be profitable depending on the cost of flame sacs, and Tender Wolf Steak is generally a cheaper way to get the 12 stam buff.
---
Wiping and a slow raid costs more because of consumables. If some1 fucks up and you die, you lose a ton of gold.
---
Say someone blows up the geddon bomb and every1 has 15 gold worth of consumes on them. 
---
You just deleted 600 gold.
---
Yes.  Recklessness is better to use in SM so you don't get fleeing mobs.  Especially if you have a few melee in the group that benefit from the Armor reduction (including tanks threat).
---
Is sharing an opinion in a constructive way crying? You're essentially saying that since I want dual spec I want to play retail.
---
Seriously, I did MC last week and while im only a few pieces BiS I still end up losing roll on gear to some level 57 in shoddy greens.
---
Starting to question whether this BiS nonsense is even worth it.
---
Not relevant to the topic.
---
**Blood-Queen Lana'thel yells**: Foolish mortals. You thought us defeated so easily? The San'layn are the Lich King's immortal soldiers! Now you shall face their might combined!
---
**Blood-Queen Lana'thel yells**: Rise up, brothers, and destroy our enemies.
---
My server has guilds of 3-5 people that host "guild-hosted" MC and Ony pugs with legendaried, recipes, mats on reserve, and people FLOCK to these runs because they are generally well lead, no bullshit runs that get completed quickly and efficiently.
---
Being new at Warrior and at lvl 28, I shall test this!
---
It depends what numbers you’re working with. If you’ve only got 50-100g, then yea 40g is a lot. But 1000+ you can have a couple going at a time (you don’t want to oversaturate the market with bars) and  make 20-30g a day just on the AH. 
---
But depends on your server.
---
From what I understand she fireballs players in P2 in order of threat and the fireball resets or drops a significant amount of threat. If you want to make sure you can use a gnomish cloaking device to reset aggro before P3. That way you can also pool up mana for P2 without having to worry about not getting fireballef snd dying insta P3.
---
Nope. Not what I’m saying. Read again.
---
^This^
---
Just play as an undead and cannablize your enemies.
---
It is greedy, it exploits peoples desperation for a tank
---
Google the definition of greed and explain to me how it's not greedy if you can
---
Server has layers, it's like an indirect "Please do not start on this server" message, which is every single PvE server in Germany.
---
You've obviously only ever played hunter to 60. Try roll warrior and come back crying about not being able to solo an on level boss. Just lol
---
No but its comparable due to high raw stats
---
Go get the ClassicLFG add on. That is the best you will get.
---
Yeah I hit every leveling zone yesterday and this past weekend and this was what was up.
---
I’m a 54 Priest that’s about to hit 55. What would you recommend I prioritize as I level towards 60 in preparation for endgame raiding (attunements aside)? 
---
I’m in a well-established guild that requires proof of consumables in order to raid each week and emphasizes the importance of BiS gear and enchants, nothing too extreme for a guild that wants to clear content efficiently which I respect; I am currently 300 herb/skinning but I’ve saved all my herbs to date so I can switch to Alchemy, but what should I focus on as I continue to level so that I’m MC/Ony ready at 60?
---
There is probably a laundry list of 30+ raids, dungeons, quest lines, zones, battlegrounds, etc. that could be added as classic +.  The original map has so much potential to fill in.  All the while not raising power creep with more interesting things like unique set bonus' or items to add gameplay mechanics to classes without needing to radically rebalance classes or add new specs to be fun.  Such as Hemo Rogues having a set that increases hemo damage by say X when a bleed affect is on the damage, similar to mangle worked in TBC but in reverse.
---
comparing someone taking a planned vacation to chill and play games with friends to someone binge drinking for two weeks straight. Makes no sense man. Also, bro posted is facebook (fucking lul) , he seems to have a pretty normal life outside of this 2 week instance
---
Yeah i didnt include it since it was originally stated on TechnoBacon55's post. But yes, very true, one of the sole reasons you actually go arms for PvP.
---
It’s a bit unconventional, but I enjoy using this spec.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IZ0xVuxxoxZxxMtM0z
---
There's still other valuable pieces, Painweaver and other drops from Drakk, as well as Finkle's Skinner from the Beast.
---
I use Autobiographer, it keeps track.
---
How are you pulling these stats?
---
Yeah there definitely a global CD for switching weapons and I think that’s the issue. Op was just really pushing for it being a 1 button press but I don’t see how haha
---
I legit LOLed
---
I kind of wish it was dead! I was trying to farm in Arathi Highlands lastnight, and there were so many people killing mobs I couldn't even get my weapon out.
---
You know I thought 35 would be too low but I ran it with 2 35 dps(both melee) and it went fine.  I think the tank was only 37 or 38 but they kept aggro off me on mograine fine.  It's a pretty easy dungeon as long as everyone is patient in clearing the cathedral.
---
Now trying to do DM day 1 with a level 15 war tank and that did not work.  I think VC does more dps than mograine...  I think that and BRD emperor with all caster dps with a level 53 tank were the only ones we couldn't pull off.  Done BRD/Scholo/Strat with ~55/56 tanks fine.
---
That's an old meme right there
---
Any warrior at 20% is like that on boss fights, except the tank.
---
Arms wars just need WF
---
Arms for pvp (mortal strike) and fury for pve. You can play 2h fury specially for leveling but dual weild is better end game i think
---
Assuming doing everything over again is as much fun as doing it the first time.
---
They'll also complain that it gives them terrible shits when I bet they're just echoing what's become a sort of meme.  If some meat/rice/beans tears your stomach up that much you need to go to a doctor.
---
Why is it always Incendius :(
---
Not more. But it is a part. Also it behoves you to join an active guild. Active guilds with active communities. Makes making guilds and recruiting guilds easier. 
---
I’ve been trying to build a guild on live since Legion and it’s impossible unless you already have a working raid team. I have built a 60+ member guild on Classic  since launch with minimal effort because guilds are a NEEDED aspect of classic.
---
*me casting IMPROVED fortitude*
---
Is shadow still viable for 55-60 dungeon healing? I know it’s not for raids.
---
For solo farming SM + DS (30/21/0) is best, since you can sack VW for that HP reg and also get siphon life + 10% shadow damage. It shines when you do 90% dot damage, like in solo Mara (or solo DM:E if you can do it). The spec falls off in dungeons, but people won't complain. It is absolute garbage for raids.
---
Leveling is a breeze with feral, you have decent kill times, movement speed, and near unlimited sustain.
---
At 60 dungeons are no issue as resto. In raids you won't be a top healer but most raids want 2 resto druids for innervate and brez.
---
After watching a online buddy stream lootship 2 from the Deathwing raid, I only play Nintendo audio tracks for my BGM.
---
My first playthrough for each expansion I play the native music and sound. It's great. But there's something great about playing Mario game tracks for openworld, Metriod music for dungeons and raids.
---
Me neither
---
I really hope there wont be TBC
---
Basically you need to create a new Indicator, type Icon, and set it to your MotW buff.
---
Additionally, if you go down into the Statuses section and find the buff, you can tick a little box to have it only display if target is missing the buff. 
---
I wrote a pretty long writeup of the functionality of grid for some other guy a while ago. If you want detail, I'll find it and paste it to you.
---
Oh right, of course
---
I can tell 14. is PallyPower.
---
15. Could be ScrollingCombatText or MikScrollingBattleText
---
By accepting the playstyle, that's how.
---
I remember I got to 60 back in 2015 on my Paladin without every using Judgement once.
---
Started to read the tooltip, didn't bother, never used it.
---
Rerolled to Horde and leveled a Paladin once again in BC and I was flabbergasted how I never used Judgement even once.
---
Yeah I remember when 2 rogues in the group decided to kill plugger for dagger once we were past the guzzler. Then we wiped further in and got a little problem when trying to run back (especially since I told everyone to stay dead since I can get back quicker).
---
Or at least the ability to collect scalps or ears.  Necklace anyone?
---
Actually a very valid point :) Maybe I'm just getting a bit burnt out. I still stand by my arguments, but I hear you.
---
It's not factually bad though, it's just your opinion that it's bad. Almost nobody wants dual-spec in Classic, whereas almost the entire playerbase wants the game to be as historically accurate as possible. 
---
Classic WoW brings unique challenges to the game that were (and still pretty much are) completely unique to this game. By enabling people to play dual-spec you're enabling people to just swap from DPS to Tank whenever they fancy it. Right now, if you want to play Tank you have to commit to it and you have to learn your class properly.
---
??? to be able to afford a two week vacation to do something you enjoy is not something to be jealous of? Tell that to all employees without paid vacation, as well as all persons who don't have jobs to begin with
---
First of all, im speaking about what is optimal so I dont mean to say that you can not possibly play prot spec / feral. You can play w/e you want and in can work out just fine in most cases, but if you want to squeeze out every last bit of performance then prot is pretty bad. Secondly, def worth having a feral y, pretty good tps tank and can do decent dps while not tanking, you are still not superior to a fury in those aspect in most cases but you still bring one for the LotP buff wich is pretty noice. Add to that the fact you can offtank when nessecary and you def wanna bring one.
---
Respec the day you walk into a raid. 
---
You can heal everything as Shadow with no problems being holy specced does increase your mana efficiency, reduces cast time etc to boost your effectiveness in raids.  
---
I have been respeccing to solo farm after our raid days are done for the week.  I am up to 35G for my next respec though so I am going to have to stop I think.
---
If people ask nicely enough then I'll help .  If however they expect me to drop what I'm doing and kill what they can't, then it depends what kind of a mood I'm in.  As the goblins say, time is money friend!
---
OHH NOO, unclerooster thinks I look weak. What will I do.
---
There are a lot of idiots out there
---
Lol, I just see that as a dude that wants to lead a group. More likely scenario is he will not allow class or specs in that compete for his loot.
---
Yikes.
---
Sure mate. I know what I've read, and you're already covering yourself for when BWL will be farmed, which is being defensive as hell. :D
---
That's what's great about the option of being a shadow priest. If they are in shadowform you know you aren't getting healed (even though leveling shadow I still dropped form to save someones life). If you spec holy nobody should be dying because you wanted to do some dps. Doesn't make sense to me.
---
I had this issue. Someone in my guild knows the person who runs the site. Guess they were in the same retail guild. I think the website owner did something because my character showed up immediately after my guildy contacted them for me.
---
I would try to find a contact email address for the site and send them a message. If there is no contact info, pm me and I'll see if I can hunt down who helped me. PM me what server, guild, and toon you are trying to see.
---
Vanilla definitely had all of those things, for sure.
---
I was referring to noobs who don't understand why BoE's are need rolls, kids claiming that literally every roll they lose is a "ninja", etc.
---
Correct. Don’t wanna show other messages
---
But you'd have an option to go fury and prot, and that's what matters. Or even just enable tri-spec and you could do what you want - or just free respecs at trainers. Any option would be about the same.
---
The reason I play as a mage
---
OP probably immediately multi-dots and doesn't wait for the tank to safely pull and wonder why warrior can't aoe tank well.
---
You are mage that's all you good for
---
Had a run-in with a super entitled "15 year veteran" hunter yesterday when I agreed to tank Scholo for the first time with my guild . He was probably the first 'toxic' player ive ran into so far in classic. He ended up driving the other random priest we had to leave because of drama and then he left. Got both replaced and we were in the dungeon not 3 minutes later. Feels nice being a tank in non-raid content so far.
---
Because he is dps tanking while dual whielding.
---
Big threat and a shitton of mitigation/stamina etc from tier set.
---
This is how I feel. And I’m all angry and confused and sad at the same time!
---
All good man.  Shields/HoTs are fine in 5-mans.  They should have helped you instead of trash talking then kicking. I know how it feels, I get lost sometimes and a lot of people expect everyone to be experts.
---
What AH addon for prices does it work with?
---
 Luckily I was a simple warlock, who didn't care about the mail helmet, so I can't even fathom paladin's frustration after that roll
---
30-40 was pretty fast for me. I basically lived in SM as I am playing a warrior right now. The instance farm was enjoyable the loot was so worth it.
---
What I find really strange (mainly happens in Strat UD) is when packs are skipped, we kill the boss, then kill the pack afterwards anyway to continue.
---
The topic is about mechanics, not about what makes the most gold per hour ffs.
---
Interesting. I'm a GM of a small guild, almost got our 40 core and have never heard of this. I wonder how the pushback would be from the members if I did this.  
---
Also what do you use guildbank money on (if you know)? I'm starting to get a little bit from the BoEs that drop off of rag/ony.
---
Awww poor baby can't solo farm a level 60 dungeon.  Cry more.
---
Tell her she shouldn't (usually) be using drain mana on mobs.
---
Even if it's not fun the second time he would get what he wants. Just has to actually work for it.
---
I'd say it's okay for LBRS/UBRS. Scholo and Stratholme can be a bit rough at times with the wrong group/tank.
---
I usually write them that we already have a &lt;class&gt;.  Usually they understand that it's not useful to decrease the chance of getting a desired item. For other classes I ask the group if they mind having another mage/warlock/hunter whatever. If they do, I just reply with "Sorry we already got a &lt;class&gt;".  I think that's polite and reasonable.
---
I dont think you know what the word defensive means. Either that or you are trolling.
---
All that stops after marriage. 
---
Then it’s all about healing her to full after every little life tap.
---
Some Shadowcraft are VERY well itemized.
---
I am a level 30 Tauren Druid, I was going more for resto which I really enjoy but I was feeling a bit burnt out leveling. I redid my talent tree and put my focus on feral because I enjoy my cat form and heard feral levels faster, but I am feeling a bit lost about how to set up my action bar when I engage mobs. Any recommendations?
---
There will be always a lack of tanks. Especially on PvP or RP realms. Everyone want to be strong or kill other faction. Not being useless.
---
Just nature of game. Work with a guild, team gank. 2v1 4v1 who care. Help tanks doing quests. Don't be selfish and think about your needs before everyone else.
---
That is the classic fun. I don't want Dual Spec. Being forced to do something because "dual spec" is a thing won't suit people. Only strickens guilds.
---
*Almost* everything. Rip dude.
---
Not really. Short sighted approach. Having a condensed player base (all 1-10/20) means that ALL the players are in a handful of zones. As player levels become more dispersed and they have access to dungeons and the whole map, the need to later zones becomes a lot less important. The playerbase expanded in range of activities, zones and levels. Therefore the likelihood that thousands of people are running around Elwynn is a lot lower. 
---
But lol layerzzz 
---
Come on now. Some people just really want to hate and can’t even think of how  practical some things are.
---
The alternative is that they are going to intentionally stack casters and do the same thing. It's cool if you want to run BRD 300 times to get a fucking trinket but I've just going to specify the reserve ahead of time. I'm going to use my limited adult time to play how I want while progressing my character instead of trying to pretend I'm enjoying the camaraderie of people that probably won't type 5 words during the entire run.
---
That sounds fun, standing back while you do everything for them.
---
That might be more genious than I have realized. I have been playing fury tank with a 1hd and shield. If I just went dualwield tank, things might be working out much better for me, possibly even to an extent that would fulfill my needs. My main interest isn't tanking raids, but being able to tank dungeons at max efficiency. Thanks for your input :)
---
But you kind of do :/
---
If you want spec flexability then you inherently dont want to play classic. You cant have both.
---
Add a line like this at the top will self target if you hold alt:
---
/cast [mod:alt, @player] Renew
---
Typing on mobile, the syntax may not be correct, but the idea is.
---
wasn't that a quest in bgs? but they got taken out I believe :(
---
At first I was trying to help her out and inform her on some good spell rotations, but then realized I was taking out half of the fun for her. Letting her figure out what’s fun for her. That was my classic expletive so that’s what I want her to have. But I do agree that drain mana on mobs is terrible lmao
---
Defense eliminates crits, not crushing blows.  Crushing blows can only be eliminated by pushing them entirely off the attack table, which you can only do with Shield Block or ridiculous (unattainable) amounts of defense.
---
Honestly from 55 onwards you might as well be focusing on gearing and gold. Find a profitable mob that works for your class and grind it hard (cause you're gonna need the gold at 60 for your epic mount anyway). BRD and Dire Maul should be your next focus for gear. If you're attuned to Molten Core a well-geared level 58 DPS will out-DPS a medium-geared 60 anyway. Have a word with your GM and see if he agrees
---
Thanks for your insight, assbutter9.
---
In Scholo???
---
Geez, I'd start wondering if he just bought the account off ebay!
---
No.
---
Its a nerf foam/plastic sword.
---
You can't convince me otherwise.
---
Thanks, i do agree that it would open the game up more and probably be fun in the short term. But i love the specialization identity that not being able to switch in and out of a spec provides. Its what makes this game feel more like a roleplaying game. Theres an inherent cost if you want to respec which forces players to make a decision that cant be switched on a whim.
---
Does it req. Engineering to open the last door?
---
This way I’m getting AD rep and leveling tho. I don’t have an efficient gold farm until brd pick pocketing Once I’m 60
---
Fun fact: when the honor system first came out, you had to loot every corpse from players you killed.
---
Ugh, I totally forgot to talk to that guy when I ran mara and now have his staff and stuff sitting in my inv.
---
Your experience differs from mine, mine is "full on warriors" because the tanks are all way warriors. Every. Single. Time.
---
I was a young boy once in 2005 who thought that it was a good idea to level a resto druid... As you said, a real torture. I was not killing mobs, I was outlasting them...
---
I'm a paladin but thank you. Also leather is useless for pvp on plate wearers. Killed so many horde warriors.
---
Bring more pro bis raiders.
---
That has nothing to do with skinning.
---
I'm 54 and I spent the last two levels farming demons for felcloth and demonic runes. Robe of the Void is ass.
---
Just pay for respec?
---
&gt;I can't understand why you would see it as bragging.
---
Because why else would you feel the need to share that gross /played? He must be proud of it.
---
&gt; I also don't understand why you would deem it pathetic.
---
Dedicating a month of your life to a game that is 2 months old is pathetic. Playing 20 hrs a day for 2 weeks is pathetic. Come on... how can you not agree? The guy clearly is happy about it from what I see in his respomses. He doesn't provide an excuse as to why he plays so much other than that he has no life outside of WoW.
---
&gt; He is just has passion for the game, and is in a situation that allows him to play. He could be struggling with any problem in life, and cope by playing WOW.
---
I would say he is struggling with a WoW addiction in his life. And he is coping by playing more WoW.
---
&gt; Calling it pathetic is just unnecessarily judgemental.
---
I disagree. Its appropriately judgemental. 30 days!? Lmao. Come on... that's pathetic.
---
Assuming you're &lt; 30 you'll find that 1-30 is awful, it starts getting good once you get sweeping strikes, and then a few levels later Ravager from SM Armoury
---
Damn, okay. I will try to get it soon then!
---
Hated undead rogues as a Gnome Warlock. Death Coil changed my life.
---
Technically the Alliance and Horde aren't at war (yet). 
---
Besides we all know the majority of what will happen in Phase 2 can't really be described as fighting.
---
15 rage min cost
---
There is also a pick pocketing addon named pick pocketer that tracks session and lifetime pick pocketing cash.  Its pretty nifty.
---
This addon though I'll absolutely be grabbing.
---
Sounds like you should play retail then
---
And yet we dont require people with less gear to pay to group, or people of less desirable classes/specs.  Healers arent being paid.  The logic is flawed because we dont implement that sort of thinking ANYWHERE in the game other than 5 man pugs with tanks. Its toxic.  Ruins the spirit of the game.  You are rewarded for tanking by having easy access to groups and easier access to gear.  The benefits are built into the game.  You arent even keeping your own argument straight, tanks are paid due to demand, not effort.
---
&gt;&gt;Plus I'm sure a lot of people who maxed out by day 3 are probably waiting until phase 2.
---
True. Once you have finished your pre-BIS-meme items theres really not much to do besides log on for raids once a week. Nothing new will be added in p2 besides worldbosses that only the top guild of each server will get a shot at. Im really wondering if there is even a point in playing until p3 hits.
---
I wish more people thought of it this way. I've seen so many mages get burnt out of the game already. Ask them why they feel this way, the ones I know were all solo content, They leveled by mass pulling and aoeing, they hit 60 they got some prebis but more dungeons, then they went to ZF farm. The mindless interaction, they did it for hours every day. It was rare to see them in my group for anything unless it was raid. I'm generally trying to get people gear, while waiting I'm killing all alliance, laughing in discord, having a blast.
---
I would rather people straight up say something is reserved than warp the group to where they are the only one who can get the drop. I mean, that kind of happens when you reserve an item but you might get at least some class variety of people going for other reasons.
---
Try having a single instant cast heal on a 30 second cooldown
---
Definitely not dead but at the same time I'm quitting now.
---
I played a short time in BC and then never played an MMO until SWTOR (nightmare progression guild). After playing classic, it was fun getting to 60 with friends and ripping through the raids a couple times but overall the game is just so mind-numbing easy that it's just not worth the time/money.
---
I got my fill of MMO's in this lifetime I think. After a while it just feels like you're sucked into a second job at a virtual casino looking for community that you don't find offline.
---
Thank you for bringing this gem to my attention
---
You take no fall damage as a ghost
---
But it kind of is a problem.  If you increase the pool of people who can easily switch, then the odds of finding someone who wants to do it is better.
---
There are a couple QoL things which I do wish was added, and they are things which were heavily requested during vanilla as well.  Dual Spec is one of them, but also the Disenchant greed was another.  Having to debate between greed to vendor or let someone DE and possibly split he mats was a pointless debate.
---
I don’t have nearly this many addons and I often get a message saying it may slow down my game. Is there a way to a lot more memory to addons? Or should I just ignore this message?
---
Well not about my written English, but I used to be made fun of because of my accent which made me think I pronounce things wrong. Turns out I just sound more British/ posh than most German people who try to copy the American/ hollywood accent. 
---
I learned English in Spain first.
---
No finished returns or is that PvP only?
---
That's impossible
---
Argent dawn will be good as you need it eventually for Naxxramas attunement I believe.
---
yes, but you have to consider that it is also 15 rage cost total, and it relies on a mob hitting you, which sometimes may not be the case (say random stuns from rogues, procs etc) 
---
all in all it just takes longer to apply, whereas the sunder will be solid threat (not as much as revenge though but thats fine) on DEMAND
---
but generally your point is valid
---
Thanks dude. You’re literally the only one to provide feedback in regard to someone who was bugged and then fixed. I appreciate it, gonna try that now
---
Do Tirion's questline for the ring, and possibly Hydraxian quests but you probably won't need to douse if your guild already has it covered so no rush there.
---
Other than that just grind dungeons for your BIS.
---
You can easily take all the orbs on low pop servers :D
---
It makes me so irrationally angry.
---
Arms till about lvl 55 then switch to DW fury
---
If you use Vuhdu for raid frames, note that there is a setting in that mod you have to set to allow Clique to function. Grid and blizzard frames should work by default with Clique. Not sure about healbot or other various frame addons.
---
Any drops? How much gold did you make out of this?
---
It doesn't make him look weak, it makes it look like he's trying to be careful with someone that has trouble understanding subreddit rules.
---
get a job
---
I’m not sure if rupture has an actual swing, or if it passively applies a dot so I can’t say 100% sorry.
---
It's called diminishing returns, and yes that's pvp only.
---
Keep in mind that:
---
1. Rogues have talents that highly increase the crit chance of Backstab (and sometimes Ambush) if they play dagger rogue (+30% crit chance on Backstab).
---
2. The tank shaman will use Rockbiter, not Windfury. 
---
I get what you're saying, but the likelihood of Ambush/BS critting for a rogue is a LOT higher thanks to talents than you might suspect. 
---
That being said, you're absolutely right. Initial threat is a problem in the game, not exclusive to 1 class. Any class opening with a crit as their first attack/spell will probably pull aggro from his tank.
---
Yep thats how it seems to go. People either outright say an item is reserved or you whisper them and get shot down because they dont want competition. So you can have an individual discussion with every person you whisper, or you can put it in your post. Same thing honestly.
---
I wanted this armor really bad until they announced late game itemization.  I guess normal SP gear will do.
---
This sub: "The economy is inflated because layers and Dire Maul"
---
Also this sub: "Remove one of the biggest gold sinks from the game!"
---
&gt;ninja looting
---
lol stop
---
it was a video of 3
---
Classicswingtimer i think it’s called, and I only track my mainhand.
---
expensive mats/consumes for main tanks maybe?
---
As a retail mythic+ player, I always dps in my 5 man groups. The key is finding a sweet balance between dps and heals!
---
Hope the dog house has good WiFi
---
No idea why they recreated this artificial technical limitation since it's not even accurate. It's so annoying even having delay at vendors and fishing..
---
Its incredible how nice people are when you give then food/water, too.  I was just doing a quest the other night on my mage (pretty sure it was a quest and not a dungeon.  I was dog tired, dont remember a ton of that night...)  I made up a few stacks of food/water and a stack or two of food to the melee, food/water to the one range we had (hunter maybe?) and then some water (maybe food?  dont remember) to the person healing.  They were all super happy.
---
That was on my lvl 18~20ish alt.
---
I can tell you i LOVE getting mage water on my 60 priest.  Shit is like gold to me (i suppose it literally is vs using my own argent water)
---
PS to mages: I know you have to make food/water and buff everyone, but if youre in a group with a priest, consider giving them arcane int ASAP.  If you do it before you trade them water it can help a lot for buffing (it can often times come out to an extra fort buff between drinking, or if youre in a  raid its often the difference between being able to buff fort AND spirit between drinking)
---
I have this but haven't really figured it out. I have it so right click brings out my trinkets but it always replaces one if the trinkets, not necessarily the one I right clicked on. I'd like to be able to select what trinket for both slots. Any idea of what I may have missed?
---
Good copy paste. It still doesnt make sense though. Its like saying the weather forecast was done defensively because they only predicted 25 degrees instead of 30. That shit is straight moronic.
---
rofl
---
I always intend to give water without asking, but I usually get preempted by the "give water" request. I'm gonna give you water, just give me a lil bit, shit takes time.
---
&gt; If everyone can take care of all their own pve and resource needs quickly and efficiently, then people just raidlog and/or live in their own bubble.
---
This did and will happen anyway.
---
the guild leaders epic mount of course
---
Oh yeah, I've been talking purely from a PvE perspective. My bad!
---
That's a good point, didn't even think of that since our server is lower end and we don't seem to have many people trying fringe playstyles.
---
Tiebreaker rolls don’t show in the console.
---
The client does a hidden roll if its a tie.
---
This 'holier than thou' attitude is getting tiring. You're not babysitting anyone, you're doing your job.
---
LOL, this is nothing. A good bot has more variation. I've seen bots in groups.
---
While you're waiting for his ban, farm the area out with him as your mindless mob killer. :p
---
He was probably thinking of warriors specifically.
---
Yea, I get the sarcastic spongebob. 
---
I think people do have a point that it's kind of a bad sword ... was just using your comment to mull through my thoughts on it lol :D
---
The thrill of battle.
---
Ah yes, another person who wants to form a party without putting a single ounce of effort and wants it to be done with a press a button.
---
"B-but it doesn't teleport you to the dungeon, it allows you to do more dungeons which is the only reason I play WoW."
---
Sorry bro, this isn't World of Dungeoncraft.
---
Sounds like a good place to hang out and snag good deals!
---
ravager is way better than whirlwind axe IMO. whirlwind axes probably needs 1 person to help get that for you in the early 30s, but ravager needs level 37 min. So you get whirlwind axes, then that keeps you going until you can pick up ravager, which is way better for &gt;1 mob and about the same for 1 mob.
---
mana in retail? 🤣
---
Technically everyBOE should be greeded. Unfortunately it takes one asshat to need it thus all need it becomes the norm. The temptation for epics is just too great for most people. 
---
Greens are lower in value so most people abid by those rules
---
The provisions part is pretty meh, but when you move on to the furbolgs you actually make decent gold. Fucktons of runecloth, rich thorium veins if you have mining, regular greens that usually vendor for at least 1g, and very occasionally a blue BoE or a purple BoE if you're really lucky. 
---
The only downside is, there's other people there all day every day. Both Horde and Alliance have quests there, and other Alliance trying to grind the mount. And they don't always wanna group up
---
That's not a problem with Classic, that's a problem with the DPS.
---
In Wrath and beyond, DPS could open up and go ape-shit on mobs with no consequences. In Classic, they have to be responsible for managing their own threat. This is a gameplay mechanic that they need to learn.
---
Even so, dual spec doesn't solve this. Putting 51 points into the prot tree isn't going to generate more threat than 30 for most classes.
---
Please don't, I'm only 46 and I've played every day since release!
---
/r/ihadastroke
---
If this were change my view, you’d get a delta. My only response would be that I’m in I think the 4th most populated server and when I’m on during the day it’s mostly hardcore players. The guys that watch recount when you’re fighting quest enemies
---
What level can i join XP runs as hunter?
---
Your *opinion* is valid, but even on these boards I don't think your experience is representative of the overall Classic population. 
---
I've played about 15-20 hours/week since launch and am level 49.  This equates to about 5 days /played, on pace for between 7 and 8 days /played at 60. 
---
I think the bulk of current players are still in this leveling phase, somewhere around level 35-40 up to 60.  Who knows. 
---
But there's plenty to do. 
---
Personally I would enjoy Dual spec or reduced cost to respec because it is a timesink to require people to farm up the 50g (or 45, 40, whatever) for respecs.  IMO the game would be more fun to allow people a secondary spec.
---
Perhaps 20g to switch between dual specs, and the regular full cost to 'change' either of them.  So there's still a gold penalty just less, so folks can have dedicated 'second specs' and not have to farm as much gold to switch between.
---
LFG works now that we "bring the player not the class" but in Vanilla, with loot tables the way they are and the importance of gear, etc - its still very much Bring the Class and hope the player knows what he's doing.   
---
this is why guilds are so critical in Classic. but, it's funny - because I see people joining guilds just to be toxic and act like asses, and I can only assume they have the retail mindset - that you can just move on and be anonymous or something.  
---
I work from home and find groups at 2pm during the week. I am on a west coast server, and live on the east coast - so it's even odder.   
---
Find some people that play during your window. Friend them. Chat with them when you're on. Take an interest in them. help them. they will do the same. if not - find a different group. 
---
I think people are so used to hauling to max and raiding that people forget that the original game took Years of playing and cultivating friends and getting to know players, etc.  it wasn't a speed run. no one knew what the future held.  so, to that end, it was part of the game - the relationships. 
---
either way - i wish you luck - and I feel your pain. I have 7 quests for Ulda, and I cant seem to ever get a good group to run through it - and it can be frustrating, but ill keep leveling and grinding until my guildies have the time =)
---
Sure!
---
I keep seeing more and more threats about this but I honestly don’t see it happen. I believe you guys but I wonder why I’m spared from the fun of salty people
---
Naxx gear is already way too powerful. I would love some extra content but in Naxx gear people easily oneshot each other. If they added a ton of stam maybe it could fix that but then people in Naxx+ gear would become fucking raidbosses.
---
Don't need to right now since I was financially responsible. Thanks though.
---
Just put everyone who spams reserved on the ignore list. That is the only way to change their attitudes.
---
Sorry, only have KitKats.
---
He's bent over and pulled them from the depths of his bowels.  No numbers are anywhere. It's really silly to make claims when there is absolutely no way to know what the player base was and currently is.
---
Damn how is it possible
---
Reminds me of the Key and Peele football celebration skit
---
Classic is the first WoW game for me and I am enjoying it :)
---
Most the time the person who rages and leaves was at fault.
---
Honestly just making alts.
---
the only parkour I accept is RFC.
---
I feel your pain. I leveled shadow because it's easier to level and you still can heal dungeons into the 50's and I have pretty much no issues healing. I had a couple issues with tanks wanting to clear content faster than my mana would allow so I created a couple macros - mana low, out of mana and they work well. Easier than looking at mana bars. I think it would be good and kind of funny if you created a couple of macros like need heals, on the verge of deah and things like that. If I saw I'd get a laugh and it'd work.
---
the struggle, then swim around under city dodge the random skull mobs and 60s that are guarding the instances like their life depends on it
---
I got extremely lucky on my current Classic main.
---
I ran BRD 3 times before my HoJ dropped.  2 full quest runs and 1 Stealth Run with 2 other Rogues.  Won the HoJ on my first Stealth run.
---
I ran Stealth Runs 4 more times with that Rogue group, but HoJ didn't drop again.  Told them to add me and I'll gladly help out on any Stealth or full runs for anything they need.
---
The player that formed the Stealth group whispered me afterwards that he had run Anger at least 20 times and that was the first time he saw it drop.
---
so i just finished leveling my warlock and want to level another character while my friends catch up. I mainly just want to focus my next character on gold making - what class(es) should I consider?
---
Population numbers are fairly balanced, but the attitudes of the players are not. 
---
Alliance simply doesn’t care for PvP. This is outside IF during peak evening hours and there wasn’t a single person wanting to practice some duels.
---
It is not, because on it's own it doesn't have any healing. The healing is a secondary (maybe even tertiary, depending on how it's written) effect, rather than the primary effect. 
---
And either way, I believe the shoulders in question (which I also wore for a while, because they were an upgrade for me too) specify healing spells. Since that's not a spell, even if healing WAS the primary affect, I don't think it would extend to buffing Bloodthirst either way.
---
that option is available in the default raid frames
---
Exactly. I made a UBRS group where only me and the other healer needed Briar trinket. The rest were hunters, rogues, warriors and enh shamans lol.
---
Bloodrazor is trash. It may be an Epic but it's never worth more than vendor price.
---
Warlock you are bottom tier for raid loot
---
Every MC weapon is going to the mages first
---
Even your BiS cloth chest is going to paladins because warlocks are seen as a support class
---
Warlocks can’t start DPSing for quite a few global cooldown as an early SB crit is going to pull aggro and you have no way of reducing it, unless you using expensive potions.
---
I could top DPS most things in my guild MC run but dont as my threat is always almost capping the tank
---
Also the worst part is the utterly gimped hit%. Every boss fight is just watching the resists and crying inside
---
Meanwhile every other piece of gear for rogues hunters etc has loads of hit rating
---
They can’t. These no changes losers have no ability to think for themselves and just rehash whatever their favorite steamer says.
---
There were massive differences between all these expansions. Do you want to have resilience? Do you want threat to be a non-issue like in WotLK? If not, do you rebalance the instances that were released for that time? How do you balance raids and what items do they drop? How do you keep several raids relevant at the same time or is there a progression? If so, how do you arrange them? How do you adress the fact that there are 40man, 25man, 20man and 10man raids?
---
I do not see this working, like ever. And if somebody tried it would be impossible to capture the spirit of any single one of the expansions, leave alone all of them.
---
Or maybe instead of making wild guesses we could trust Blizzard's statement that layering was implemented in part exactly because huge player drop-off was expected.
---
calm down. no one is attacking you lol
---
I think that people don't like that if you put in extra effort (creating/leading a group), you can get ahead.
---
Roll an alt, theres plenty of content.
---
from 50 to 60 you are better off spamming brd/lbrs because you can start getting your prebis. It's also better xp/hr if you got a good arena/prison runs.
---
They got rid of extra chests for beating the timer by a lot in 7.2, which was a few years ago. Now you simply get one additional item for making the +1 timer, and there's zero in-game rewards for hitting +2/+3 other than your key going up more levels.
---
Pagle is the best.
---
\-Totally unbiased Fisher.
---
:p
---
Even as a disc priest I constantly try to mindblast to last hit haha
---
It's #nochanges for most players because Classic is intended to be a preservation of the past. It is meant to be vanilla as close as it can be. 
---
If you start changing stuff people would start to argue "Why can't Blizzard change X if they already changed Y". And soon you find yourself in a situation where Classic isn't a preservation of the past anymore but some kind of alternative universe.
---
Have you seen their Blizzcon Talks and how they recreated vanilla? it's really eye opening in that regard.
---
Only interesting if you are a hardcore roleplayer though. We have some groups/alliances who do escorts, festivals and such, but you will never meet someone for some small roleplaying anywhere. So it's not as many players as it might sound like.
---
yeah
---
An NPC near the back door of gnomeregan (outside the instance in the big room) sells the plans
---
Real hunter right there, if he can use it its good.
---
Would be nice to have an actual tier set with bonuses for a shadow priest.
---
Could be worse, you could be a hunter with no use for DM buffs.
---
I have 100% the same! I think it’s the “software, hardware” in de mouse that changes it!
---
What are the shoulders called?
---
Right, but most reasonable people would agree that the vendor price for a bop does not represent its value to a player who could use it.  This is compared to a boe, where the market price does represent its value to a player who could use it.  Therefore the value of boes is the same for every player, regardless of whether they can use it.
---
I guess u talk about HoJ.. Maybe check some pre bis list before complaining.. There isnt a better trinket for hunters then the 20AP from HoJ.. Sure its annoying as a melee but the hunter wasnt wrong..
---
Why is PVP hit cap 3% then, when that post states 96% hit chance?
---
Idk man seems like a lot of undeserved anti reservation sentiment here.
---
It was my understanding that dodges, parries, etc also help to push crushing blows off the table?
---
26 and 11 days
---
I really wish there was a name reclamation at some point. Say, characters that haven't logged on within 3 months get their name stripped and a forced name change if they ever do log on again.
---
Even if I do, the tanks never use it.
---
No, nobody has said this during classic. Seriously, tanking is mentally tiring because if you do a bad job it's really obvious, everyone gets frustrated etc. It's even worse if you aren't 100% familiar with an instance and its pulls, people will get impatient and frustrated (sometimes even if you pull 1 pack you didn't "have to"). I'm a DPS warrior and I can tank any of these instances and I know them all like the back of my hand, the difference between tanking and DPS is seriously day and night in terms of investment.
---
Nah...it's a time trial, dude. You're supposed to go fast. If you don't wanna learn the strats and go fast and push timers...don't do time trial mode.
---
That's like joining a pick up basketball game and getting mad when the other players call you out for not dribbling.

There are more people butthurt about reserve runs than there are people reserving gear.
---
Perfect explanation!
---
*look at this stupid ninja, trying to start a dungeon group. I ain’t falling for that shit*
---
yes it's fucking boring
---
Still trying to figure out how this is more applicable to Alliance than Horde?
---
I'm a Prot warrior in pretty much pre raid BiS gear. I ran Strar live with some guildies in raid gear, and struggled like never before with threat. I usually average around 100 dps, I think I need to step that up. Any advice on how to improve? I use grenades regularly to try to hold aoe threat, which works for a short amount of time, but then mobs run wild. Single target I feel like I cant keep up and have to taunt regularly.
---
...wat
---
The thing that annoys me is they are asking for help to clear the trash and kill a boss.   If you want reserved loot, run with friends or guildies.  Don't ask for help from randoms if you're going to reserve loot.  Just seems shitty to me.
---
I am never going to participate in a group that reserves things.
---
I’m the MT for my guild and I’m like this at 20%
---
Why wouldn’t you? Execute is great threat and dmg, it’s your best ability
---
Well, where *was* the sheep?
---
This 100%. I don't like the chat spamming shit so a clipboard would be nice, but people need to have the choice who they play with.
---
The morning after chipotle is an absolute shitshow literally
---
But i get their hot sauce slathered all over it
---
Perhaps the beans in the chipotle is the most fibre you get in the American take out diet
---
So few pulls even require a shred of CC you literally wouldn't notice. If you're relying on CC then you have bigger problems.
---
That sounds like a blast... what do you mean?
---
So what gear then? Full shadow weaving? That surely means locks should be doing that too?
---
I used Verigans until I got Bonebiter at around level 38.
---
Its probably more common on the super high pop servers since there are way more potential group members to choose from.
---
Who drinks 15g worth of consumables for geddon or anything in MC for that matter? You can complete it in 4h with just 30 random 60s if the tank has fire resist and the healers mana potions + douses.
---
Haha you got me because mentioned having a basic level of intelligence. You have epicly dismantled my argument. Which pose shall I take while you crosspost this to /r/iamverysmart?
---
For Horde, in Winterspring:
---
Are there any quests around Lake Kel'Theril and Ruins of Kel'Theril? I think I've seen a quest chain around there, but I can't find it.
---
"Have you played classic less now compared to when it came out?"
---
Paladins are superior
---
It is.
---
Layers.  I popped a layer and there he was.
---
Haha look everyone it can't even write basic sentences!
---
I have sold the rod and rings multiple times. Any one can loot the chest even if they were not there for the kill.
---
And in any case the issue is not with looting privileges but rather entering the insance
---
I ran it 51 times before it dropped which is bad but not too crazy. But I would still lose it if some random guy just joined on his first run and won it over me. Hence I reserved it and got it on the first drop which felt great. Helped a lot of healers and casters get their BiS gear in the process so everyone wins.
---
Warriors gear is pretty much pre-raid bis with a few epics from MC. 
---
If you are pulling trash packs at last boss you aren't running inside the cave fast enough. The imps pull the trash, not the boss.
---
Or you could try mining in the open world, since you're a miner, and miners can mine.
---
It pisses me off when people (including myself) are not max level yet and wanting to skip large groups of mobs. I'm in the dungeon for gear yes but also because I'm currently tired of questing and wanting experience from doing dungeons.
---
The "never wait for group in 5 mans" implies he's tanking. As a warrior if I'm going to tank I don't want another warrior dpsing and rolling against me on gear. No interest in tanking a dungeon, which kind of sucks to do, so someone else can get the loot I want by playing the role I'd rather be doing.
---
Big gratz!
---
I did this in Vanilla and had the mount before BC... I know what you have been through.
---
No mount for Horde in Classic? That was a bad idea. They should have patched in the Ungoro Mount.
---
I know "no changes". But this would have been a good idea in my opinion...
---
You just need better gear.
---
What stops you from agreeing on it and then just needing anyways
---
I started counting runs when it was the only reason for me to run brd. I logged off at 59 last night, I have only seen it drop twice and lost both rolls. I'm a rogue so a little over a dozen of those runs are just stealth runs to angerforge, the rest have been pretty much a mix of full runs and anger/arena/golem. It's driving me bonkers...
---
I just rerolled a hunter and want to know if i should go mining/eng for ammo late game or if i should do mining/skinning and just bank/sell all mats until late game then drop skinning and go eng? I like skinning the animals that i kill, after creating a toon that doesnt have skinning, it feels wrong leaving the corspe on the ground and moving on to the next mob.
---
Kirtonos is healthy. More horde than alliance but overall a great community with their own mega discord.
---
I saw two hunters, Andq and Andw, just standing by different yetis in the same area just having the yeti smack their pet while they did nothing. I killed one of them and he just sat there. They were pretty clearly bots.
---
:)
---
I have to grind for firewater anyway so it's not just the rep grind.
---
ty i found it!!
---
it's https://wago.io
---
&gt;  It’s like a chess master going “well you should do this and this, because it’s obvious” to someone who has barely played any matches.
---
Not quite.
---
what the dude is trying to copy is the rapture shield build from WoTLK. He clearly remember spamming shields being good 10 years ago, but he don't know why it was good, or how it worked.... but while he remembers WoTLK meta, he can't be bothered to look up classic meta.
---
he also level'ed to 60 without ever looking at the mana cost / healing (shielding) ratio of his spell.
---
he apparently didn't realize you could grab imp power:shield / reduced cost of instant-cast ( the 2 thing affecting PW:Shield) in your talent tree while also grabbing all the other healing stuff
---
he also never realized instant-cast spells must have some drawback for being instant... wether in term of mana cost, CD or otherwise.
---
he never figured out +healing had a different coefficient on different spells which... while not totally obvious, should be one of the first thing you realize once you start stacking a bit of +healing gear (assuming he had some, and didn't go for pure MP5, which is another flaw in itself). 
---
Keep in mind he have well over a 100 hour /played on his priest to reach that point, and any of the point above should've made him seriously question is current playstyle... nevermind that his first reflex when getting called out in raid was to QQ on reddit as opposed to considering the RL may have had a point...
---
You don't get in his situation with just one or two tiny mistake... you have to combine a dozen major flaws together... and this is why  I'm loosing faith in pug.
---
casual shouldn't equals bad.
---
Oh yeah and compete with every person in the server for rich thorium nodes? Wow that sure solves my problem thanks king
---
...wat... Where I work, there are consequences for saying things I am not allowed to say. Freedom of speech does NOT protect that.
---
people still screaming "nO ChaNGeS" after two months of assholes abusing layering is rich.
---
You’re a lifesaver. 24 charms for like 30 silver on the AH. Thank you lmao.
---
Yeah that feels pretty good. Then I see one solo down 8 elites in Dire Maul and I kinda wish I was a mage.
---
Why not just stick with priest? Sounds perfect for you.
---
Assuming you're spending 100% of your time grinding shit inside the dungeon, yeah sure. The problem is that in practice you'll be at the whim of the LFG channel. Good luck finding an LBRS grinding group early in the morning, for instance.
---
Grinding has no such problem. You can do it by yourself whenever you want, and it's still up there being like 50%-80% as efficient.
---
He can join other groups that don’t do this??!
---
Thanks! Appreciate the advice
---
It doesn’t necessarily have to come after t3.  They still could use a t1.5.
---
There's good reason for that. it's pretty toxic. But if someone is reserving an item I need, i'll just not join that group. no issue
---
But either way, don't take a dumb reddit meme as a personal attack bud. Not worth getting worked up about
---
Well I mean that's why most play mages and relatively few play tanks - not only is your role important and you're shoehorned into being mr. leader in most group content, but you have to push alot more buttons than the rest of us.
---
That’s why I like playing priest I can find a group in 15 seconds too for any dungeon
---
What difference is there? They both are worth sweet sweet gold
---
Nice
---
True. Collectively the playerbase are smarter. There's still ignorance, but advice is standardised and better informed.
---
We also have 15 years of tactics refinement.
---
Why use lot word when few do trick?
---
I used to think that way, but what is more toxic; being upfront about a reserved item, or simply not inviting whole classes because they compete in loot, without even telling them?
---
HoJ is pretty rare, and it sucks to see an item that drops once in 30-50 runs go to someone else who just joined your group.
---
What it seems you fail to understand is that many classes want to do arena-anger-golem, not just HoJ classes.  It is also one of the best way to pad an arena run.  When I was farming my belt, I didn't see it drop until ~30 runs, hell I didn't even start seeing the ogre until 20+.  I have to hit the lockout 12m anyway, so killing anger is just killing time.  On top of that, golem has decent caster boots and a healer trinket.  Healer would join a arena/golem group very fast, and a tank would honestly just make their own res group if they wanted HoJ.
---
So no, it's not "spend all your time getting me my stuff", it's just locking down one item that you maybe spent way too long farming.
---
I don't think there's anything pathetic about not wasting time.  From my experience most reserves come from non hardcore players though, despite your claim.
---
don't think so unfortunately
---
Only fair Benedict has Benediction
---
I suggest skinning until later. You're gonna be able to buy arrows from vendors up to, I'm pretty sure, level 40. The eng ammo really isn't necessary until you start going for progression runs, imo. Skinning will give you very easy gold. I hit 150 skinning before I even left Barrens and had plenty of gold for class and pet skills, as well as wasting gold on unnecessary weapon skills I couldn't help myself on. Heavy leather up is usually worth selling on the AH for even steeper profit. If not paired with Leatherworking, it's just easy money, since you're not using mats to level a second skill. If I haven't been a LW as well, I'd easily have double my current gold.
---
Bring. It. On!
---
Let me know what you think after trying it! :)
---
Priest is what suits you but if u want a all around class, go for a druid, very versatile, can tank, heal, dps, but the last one is a bit shitty
---
Except nobody knows this so people are hesitant to take us
---
You obviously don't play a lock.
---
Drain Life is bae.
---
Herod
---
im at 65 anger kills and no HOJ
---
warrior i run with did the arena 300 times before he got glad chest (which was last night) 
---
we ran for 7 hours straight on saturday without even seeing the glad dude spawn
---
It does, I was suprised at Ghost Wyvern when flying.
---
They have no life. Classic WoW!
---
I did this in og vanilla and I can tell you, you are gonna be doing it for a very long time if you are farming them yourselves. I used my mage to aoe farm the ud fields to get myself a Kodo and it still took forever.. I can guarantee you won't get enough runecloth just leveling, even if you are just farming/grinding.. I did it in chunks between raiding, and it still tool me months to farm it all, but the other stuff I got sold for enough to put a big dent in epic riding though
---
“It’s hard to me to communicate” lol
---
“It’s hard for me to communicate” ftfy.
---
To be fair the original sentence makes sense, it’s just a big tell that they aren’t a native speaker. Had a giggle at that when I if read the post before reading the comments.
---
You spent the entire post talking about how much you've gathered, how you have so much gear and everything. Guess you'll need to spend some gold to do this. 
---
Frankly I think it would be annoying to encounter classes in wPVP and suddenly they can switch to their PvP spec out of the blue.
---
Pretty much what I do as a warrior tank.  I'm not inviting some scrub "dps" warrior that's just going to take my loot.
---
None of those issues that you posed would be very difficult to solve.
---
I don't really think it would be a good idea to do what they suggested but I also don't think would be tough for Blizzard to pull it off.
---
just had a druid roll need on a chance on hit polearm because "he hits when he goes out of form to heal" lmao
---
With diremaul release and the greatest hunter book, you get a +48 ranged ap trinket with 10 fire res
---
And there it is.  Common sense is stated.   People are butthurt because other groups are saying items are reserved.  What does that really do? It discourages people that want those items from messaging that group.  You are all upset, saying 'Well, I won't join that group!!!'   GOOD that is the whole reason they are putting that there. They don't want to respond to every whisper to say 'WEll, do you need this item?' - 'Oh, sorry then, we're full on your class'.   Pull your heads out of your asses and move on.   Also guilds reserving Ony Head, etc for hosting a run is perfectly acceptable, you are way too entitled if you get upset at that.  If you have a guild clearing that content it should bother you literally 0%.  If you pug, you should expect this.
---
I love our server but Stalaag has some balance issues.

My favorite is "LF2M Tank/Healer"...like congrats on finding 3 DPS, but maybe focus on finding one of the two harder roles to fill?
---
He just made it homie
---
The problem is you have to farm it constantly and fill up your bags with the stupid thing for it to be BiS
---
Hunter DPS will become shit in AQ or so, because your best attacks don't scale well. For t1 era, hunter DPS is good.
---
^^^^Please ^^^^help ^^^^me.
---
im fairly certain a feral tank &gt; fury tank in most situations according to about every guide ive read regarding tank specs/options for dungeons and raids.

i wasnt trying to get into an argument about anything.  was just pointing out that if the focus is dps/tps then feral tanks take the prize for tps.

Most reasonable people would agree that the AH price for a BoE does not represent is value to a player capable of using it as an upgrade.
---
"I want to sell this one. If you need it, go buy another one for yourself on the AH" is a dick move.
---
It's arguably bis for lvling in a cleave group since he can just spam wing clip until it procs.  It will deal more damage than explosive + volley for damn sure.
---
3 decently geared rogues can stealth to anger and kill it without a healer. or you bring a druid to stealth in with you and heal

you must be trolling at this point

Fade's a temporary aggro reduction. What is the advantage of hitting it on cooldown, instead of in response to gaining aggro?

For SM, do you find it easier to find a group at the entrance or in Trade - City chat?

FYI I'm on a PvE server so no worries of getting annoyed by other faction.

I think this is known, or at least I have heard of it. People were talking about something priests can do to bug their SP, around DMs launch last week and the ability to stack the tribute buffs. I'll have to see if I can find that thread.
---
when i see a undead start eating a corpse of an ally i always chuckle. I would love to play undead for this reason specifically. i always thought since undead can eat ally, ally should be able to skin tauren, at the minimum.
---
Sorry if this is a dumb q but w Mithril Spurs do you need to have blacksmithing for them to actually work?
---
Carbonite has something that alerts you to surrounding players from your faction and the opposing faction (pals and punks). I don't remember if there is a feature that allows you to get alerted to a certain player though.
---
&gt;I enjoy tanking dungeons, but cannot do so very efficiently without a proper specc
---
Yeah that's about where you lost me bro
---
Its not a fix, since hammer of wrath is tbc and .. you know the rest
---
You can do both actually, get the arcanite reaper AND go engineering.  Arcanite reaper is BoE and you can buy one off AH, or get the mats yourself and have someone combine it for you.  If you did want to craft it yourself, you're going to be looking at buying the plans off AH for probably a couple hundred gold.  Arcanite reaper does not require blacksmithing to equip.
---

He hasn't said that he played WotLK before, so stating that he is trying to mimic this playstyle is pure speculation.

And yes, there are thousands of players out there that do not care about efficiency.

There's a lot of toxic behaviours in the game. At least with this one you can refuse to take part, especially if you play as a desirable class/spec.
---
When in Rome...
---
very wrong,  9% is yellow/using no offhand
---
dual wielding increases white swing miss chance for both hands by 19%, so 27% miss chance on both hands
---
The minmax crowd is truly ruining the classic experience.
---
I'm playing a Night Elf priest, got an item with +16 Intellect, is that better than my current +8 Intellect and +8 Spirit item?
---
I sometimes get 2 resists in just spectator room :(
---
Did you tried LookingForGroup channel?
---
Looking for group channel
---
&gt;When I want to DPS, people laugh.
---
And then you top DPS charts.
---
pickpocketing isnt that good on classic. Brought way more gold on pserver.
---
Excellent, thank you.
---
"WAHH WAHH RESERVES ARE BAD WAHHH"
---
Then make your own group.
---
Yep, there is a reason you see some of the dominant guilds on realms loading up with multiple raid teams.  When Phase 2 launches, there will be a Raid killing the boss, a Raid defending them from PvP and probably another Raid doing half and half.  My guild just has slightly over 40 dedicated raiders, with an handful of other 60's on standby.  We can kill Rag in under 2:30.  We have almost no chance of killing a World boss in phase 2.
---
Gonna give this a go tonight - it looks great. Thanks for the effort :)
---
That's where I'm at with it too, I don't see a reason to change for a marginal possibility of fd working
---
It's insane, alliance and horde, several groups of both, fighting for the tag
---
Since mograine is EU, I would say yes go for it if you're alliance or noggenfogger for horde.
---
The BG update is going to bring a ton of people back.  Not sure how many stay when they realize the massive time sync the ranking system actually was though.
---
I expect the population to double and possibly even triple and then slowly bleed away when new people realize that all the leveling brackets are filled with twink players and that the level 60 BG's are filled with pre-made farm parties just destroying pugs.
---
I dont get the people getting mad at majority hosted guild runs claiming the legendaries/mats/patterns. Just sort of makes sense to me.
---
That's assuming there is a raid, we 15-manned it.
---
well you can imagine from the healer's point of view if the healer is always going oom at end of each pull, there's no leeway to deal with overpulls, and then the healer has to spend the largest amount of time drinking.
---
O ok, hm I guess the mount speed boost just really isn’t that noticeable then. Ty
---
I just want a tank I can pew pew with my heals 😥
---
Lol the other one is from ubrs 2% Chance to crit
---
Leveling with a Druid is great, I suggest going feral that way you get the 30% cat speed bonus at 21 which helps a ton with questing, also if your able to keep a dps/tank/heal gear you’ll be able to jump into most groups as long as your not too under leveled! Good luck my dude!
---
2 guys that will never be forgotten! :P
---
dab
---
just for yellow hits,  white attacks both mh and oh have the +19% miss chance applied
---
They’re getting paid to tank, not carry. Don’t like it? Spend an hour LFG
---
in classic tank is synonymous for warrior.  yes there are other tank classes but more often than not they are talking about warriors.
---
Perfect.
---
Completely unaware of that
---
ah i was trying to say that knowing the routes for M+ is simply part of knowing how to play M+. 
---
I agree people are dicks though
---
&gt; devayne
---
Devayne of minerals Thazz'ril was allegedly trying to find.
---
It's very easy to spawn Jed every time, fyi. Group splits up and makes a /tar jed macro, goes up the ramp and spams it a couple minutes (rogues can target him immediately by stealthing to UBRS door)
---
Spriest? Try living the boomkin life with me
---
I am strongly against the OP's opinion, but this is the irony of it all.  There is SO much money sloshing around that respec for raid night is not a problem.  
---
A guild can even afford to PAY the tanks respec costs once a week with the sale of BOE epics.  Tanks can still farm 30g an hour with ease, tanks can reserve crap from dungeons, tanks can charge to do their class roll.   
---
A tank asking for dual spec is ironic, what he really means is I dont like the cost involved in respec's.  This is about personal greed not about whats good for the game or other players.
---
And that's when the fight started...
---
Hand of justice in BRD? Arena farm?
---
You can tell when retail casuals make memes, because they think fury warriors wear might.
---
You dumb assholes made blizzard delete everything that made tanking worthwhile. No instant queues, no ability to change spec without paying all of my gold, no ability to do non dungeon content in prot spec, it fucking blows. This game sucks and if im going to fuck up my experience by being prot so that I can help you worthless dps then im taking all the gear. Be thankful that you get to roll on things that I dont need anymore
---
Lol at all the people in the thread thinking you can't make a joke with your girlfriend without her wanting to break up with you.
---
you are an idiot then, slice and dice is far better than eviscerate
---
AFAIK you can't use objects when your under an immunity effect.
---
Thanks for all the suggestions!
---
How is that entitled? The person recruiting is making it clear what they're going for and letting others know so they can decide if it aligns with their goals.
---
Picking it up up tomorrow morning after work and sleep. Looks interesting. Does it also read the /join world chat? Most server have one and uses it for LFG
---
im glad i dont care about mounts
---
just hit lvl 56, goddamn BRD is a fucking long thing. spent 3 hours in there a while ago.
---
well... if it's an upgrade for him, it's an upgrade for him...
---
To say they aren’t common is an understatement. If you don’t grab a lvl 9 owl, the next ones are level 48+.
---
Tailoring has Robes of the Void/Truefaith/Archmage for Warlock/Priest/Mage.
---
Blacksmithing has a couple items which are bop as well, but I don't think any of them are overly useful.

Before I posted it here, I deleted SlashFour from my addons folder and downloaded it from the Twitch app and checked that it worked--and it did!

It isn't.

---
I heal everything as shadow at 60. But I've got pretty good heal gear. Only thing that sucks is drinking between pretty much every pull.
---
I have an assumption he attempted to tank naxx wotlk and read about naxx vanilla. I wish he didn't ignore me, I'm curious about that tauren warrior who struggled in ZF from time to time.
---
Probably because the term "extra attack" actually means something specific I.e. the descriptions of windfury, flurry axe, thrashblade, and HoJ all use that term to mean 1 or normal "white" damage attacks
---
Questing SIGNIFICANTLY slows down in the 45-52ish range, especially for classes like warriors and rogues. Keep pushing on, you'll get through it. Throw in zf and st and maybe brd quest runs to break up the monotony.
---
Why? Its funny finishing off a caster character as they boop you on the head with a staff. Plus the mana help ya keep grinding it without a break.
---
My mistake!
---
Ah, that's good stuff.
---
On my server they’ve gone from 35 to 20g in the past week. I’d be a bit more patient.
---
Basically at that level you want Vanqisher's Sword/Sword of Omen
---
Those are really your best options til you can get Thrash Blade.
---
Put some respec on my name
---
I’d love one, thank you!
---
But watching the numbers on your meter, with the agro warnings shit themselves is golden.
---
You could level a mage, it seems aoe farming can be lucrative farming tailoring mats.
---
Good shout. At what lvl can I expect to do those runs ?
---
Just be upfront and say no warriors when you LFG. 
---
You might get some occasional snark but \#dealwithit
---
Yup. Seems like the people complaining about reserves are the real entitled ones.
---
Killing enemy players isnt enough, you want to add skinning them to your fantasy =/
---
Thats not something you should say outloud to people lmao
---
Warrior or druid. Your friend can tank while you heal,  helps you find easy groups for dungeons.
---
Here's to hoping people remember Metroboomin the druid healer
---
I enjoy tanking now, but BC was totally where it was at for bears.
---
Why is full plate bad?
---
After losing on 2 HoJs, I did all 3-man with Tank(me), warlock/mage, healer.  Bribe the healer by promising all all trash greens and unneeded blues.  Now that I have my HoJ it does make it a bit easier/faster, as we can just do arena or we can pick up a rogue for arena/anger.  Either way, I'm making sure when I finally do see the chest, there's 0 chance I'm losing the roll.
---
Getting pretty demoralized, though.  Trying to do at least 5-10 runs a day now... did 20 yesterday.  I haven't even seen the Orc since 3 days ago.
---
Well, for one I never said I didn't want to deal with terrible tanks. Dealing with terrible players (tank, healer, or dps) is part of the game.
---
For two, about half of my WoW playing time has been as a tank. I'm leaving that shite in retail.
---
For three, fuck tanks who just blame everyone else because they don't think they can do any wrong. There's *far* too many of those types.
---
Mix in some dungeons and mob grinds.
---
Never tried it.
---
My friends and I use our Teamspeak when we play together, and we use the guilds Discord for guild stuff.
---
How tf were you able to keep that name fore so long?
---
Wouldn't remember. Sorry :-/
---
Hold off on rolling engineering for a day or two.   Word on the street is that they hotfixed the hunter DM north solo farm to be impossible now (with todays maintenance).  The allegation is that they leashed King Gordok and Cho'whatever in a way that makes it much more difficult/maybe impossible.
---
That's a 50 dkp minus
---
Join the fight club warrior discord
---
Nothing to do with minmaxing finding a group in vanilla as a rogue was equally difficult. Moral of the story is don't roll a melee class that everyone and their mom plays but really doesn't offer anything unique and expect to just be handed groups.
---
I never said it would be dead but I predicted a big dropoff, it was smaller than expected but you can definitely tell pop is changing
---
They track transactions, not gold.
---
More agility generally
---
Swords still do more damage at all stages of the game
---
World bosses apply a debuff when they kill you that prevents you from attempting the kill immediately again. 
---
Sensible servers have guilds that take turns attempting the boss.
---
And also turns out, has a really good dps when powershifting. But people still think druids arent really good at anything.
---
I think across all my toons im probably a couple days over 20.  Took a few days of vacation and frankly i live in northern Wisconsin.  The weather has been shit since the game came out.  When it was warm it was raining constantly (so no fishing for me).  Then it got cold.  Now its cold and raining.
---
I go outside to go to work, the gym, shopping, etc.  Other than that im not doing jack shit outside if i dont have to.
---
Im also fortunate to be able to play a bit here and there while working, so that helps.
---
a moonkin wtf
---
Yeah, you didn't call out dps. You called out hunters/mages. It also doesn't matter *nearly* as much if a dps is bad. They are easily replaced. If your tank is bad then the entire run is ruined either for everyone or by stressing the healer to all get out.
---
I’m not going to run with you if anything is reserved period, outside of it I putg with a guild to do MC and the legendary items are reserved.
---
If I I’m taking my time to help you make a group you wouldn’t have unless I was there I’m rolling on whatever I need if it’s a upgrade. Even if it means I ninja loot it and you get but hurt. This reserve BS wasn’t a thing in Vanilla and shouldn’t be now.
---
Because Plate tends to favor Tanking stats (higher stam, defense etc.) while Leather gear is tailored for attack power/crit.
---
Turns out Rogue gear is BiS for DPS warriors too.
---
no, being greater than 10 wpn skill below the enemy causes the miss chance to be the 9%, getting 305 breaks that and the hit required becomes 6%.  5 wpn skill doesn't give 3% hit, it reduces the required hit needed by 3%.  very different things
---
Lots of leather/mail gear has much better stats. Crit %, hit % etc. Most plate in classic is itemized for tanking not dpsing, especially the set pieces.
---
There’s not a ton of plate gear that is good for fury atm.
---
Next she will summon a couch for you to sleep on.
---
Lol enhancement shammy must have been some mad people in that party
---
That warrior could be exactly like me. I can only raid in my guild as fury since we have multiple "main tanks". In order to get my fury gear (sadly leather most of the times) in a reasonable amount of time I choose to tank these dungeons to get a much quicker group than If I waited around to DPS in a group.
---
I'm sorry that happened to you but that's precisely why I form my own groups. You would have never been invited to mine because while I don't type out mask reserved when I'm looking for others, I will send a nice pm when a rogue asks for an invite stating that I'm after that specific item after 17 runs and I'm not rolling for it if it drops. If he wants to concede or just doesn't need it no worries come on in, but I do make it very clear up front before they even join my party.
---
You forgot to blank the recount names, gayboy
---
If you're Alliance, Bonebiter is a direct upgrade to Whirlwind Axe once you get strong enough to run Cathedral.
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6830/bonebiter](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6830/bonebiter)
---
You can finish a dungeon with 3 shit DPS every time. It will just be slower. You don't go anywhere with a shit healer.
---
I made my main a warrior as usual( like 3 warriors on retail) and he’s almost 48 now but I’m also not rushing or anything so decided to play a orc warlock and am having a blast! I went for more of a fun build with sword being my main hand weapon and once I get the fire stone it will be so amazing!
---
I never said he shouldn't say he was rolling on dps gear, I was just saying only what I did say.
---
Mages can also solo her. Any ranged class can.
---
I think a lot of it comes with the absurd amount of criticism that is directed towards people not going for BiS-items. Honestly either playstyle is fine. Some people want to minmax, some people don't.
---
Because rogue pieces are better for killing that warrior plate pieces. It's not full plate isn't good, it's just that rogue leather is much much better.
---
Its mainly important at the start of the fight when a tank may have low agro on multiple mobs and you are dropping not just dots but also heals, avoiding pulling threat in the first place is the idea.  Heals generate enough threat alone to sometimes pull early in a trash pull, if you have SW:P up on 3 or 4 mobs too you are on 4 threat tables and rising fast.
---
If you look carefully, there's a colon ( : ) after DM.  This is because some people type DM:E, DM:W, DM:N, and DM:T.
---
/u/TSTC is recommending that "DM:" (with the colon) be removed from Deadmines searches.
---
first 6 months you mean
---
Warrior tanks suffer from that too
---
Damn. I have lock alt. Seeing all these smh posts on warlock makes me second guess... lol
---
Good read at work. As a former priest I say that guy sounds like a derp face mcgillicutty, find someone else
---
That's for PvE server. On PvP it's a massive battle.
---
You mean judging SoR on CD?
---
Those % aren't accurate.
---
There is no plate with agility? And agility is good on warriors why?
---
I think that was something added later so might be disabled in Classic. DBM used to be able to set the pull timer as a bar though (like a boss ability)
---
If everyone only wants to do a dungeon if they are guaranteed a piece of loot I can promise you that you won't get very far.
---
I'm not a warrior player so take this with a grain of salt, but it's not that full plate is bad per se. There's just so many pieces that are mail and leather that actually end up providing much better stats than the equivalent plate pieces available. Like leather gloves with hit% are probably better overall than plate gloves with just a little strength, etc.
---
The problem is that it’s gotten to the point where they’re reserving practically everything. Which I agree isn’t a big deal except the channel now goes at Twitch chat speed of the same groups spamming a run that nobody wants to join for 20 minutes. And their posts are a damn paragraph with all the shit they’re reserving.
---
It’s like those pawn shops that re-post their shit on Craigslist every day and tag it with every conceivable word making it really difficult to find what you’re looking for.
---
The available plate generally just has bad stats, like its all str/stam/defense with little hit/agi/crit
---
Pop gnomish invisibility for a threat wipe before going ham
---
Get the white tiger with the green gem.
---
I got the darker grey one with the blue gem but I wish I got the green gem boi :(
---
"shit happens", maybe a couple of noob manoeuvres but thats what this phase is all about.  Finding a guild you are happy with and working on wiping out mistakes before things get too tough.    
---
Its up to you how long you put up with the "mistakes" and if this errors keep happening week in week out with the same players and no action being taken then it may be time to shop around.  
---
Ask questions of your guild, like are there class leaders assisting other players learn and develop.  Ask what systems there are for tracking raid efficiency for all members, do they run raid logs.  
---
I know silly wipes are frustrating, but they also build a sense of personal responsibility and teamwork.    
---
In the average guild most people will not be experts in MC or bosses, give it a few weeks before you rage at people on discord, just some sympathetic words and encouragement can actually boost moral.  You can even pass it off as a joke "nice wipe 10/10, no more need to practice that method"
---
Ill look at it when I get home it was pure installed in my UI
---
Still not as good as Zul'farrak's Mage-only casino
---
Glad we're on the same page :))
---
&gt; Taurens are too fat
---
Good thing I can turn into kitty.
---
You should start your own ZF zombie farm groups, get some fast levels and loot. Run it to 50.
---
Grind some st/Mara til 52 and then you are ready for BRD
---
BRD is really fun, it really got me back in the mix.
---
I’m a 59 human warlock. Love my lock. Wish we had some CC, but it’s cool
---
it's more pvp than pve at first.    the team that tags it is vulnarable to attacks from the other faction for obvious reasons (being in fight with a lvl 63 elite boss monster)  so when the opposition manages to kill the main tank and some key healers, the attempt fails, and the boss gets untagged, until the next guild tries it, this will go on for a few hours until 1 guild (more likely a cartel of cooperating guilds) gets so dominant that they can both kill the boss and protect the raiders
---
No wonder mobs 20 levels below me still resist my spells.
---
Adibags has a search function, or at least I do. Maybe I have bagnon as well, in which case the search bar integrates
---
Plate isn't inherently bad, in fact armor doesn't really matter at all for DPS. It just so happens that most of the best dps stats is found in greater values on leather armor than plate.
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/rare-plate-chest-armor?filter=238;3;1#items:0-2+18](https://classic.wowhead.com/rare-plate-chest-armor?filter=238;3;1#items:0-2+18)
---
That link has a list of all the rare quality breastplates in phase 1. As you can tell, there isn't a single fantastic dps piece in there.
---
It goes like that for a lot of slots. 
---
There's like 5 or 6 good BoP rare quality plate pieces, and they are spread between the Hand, Belt and Bracer slots. Obviously you use devilsaur for Hands, so in reality you'll only wear 2 plate pieces.
---
Don't worry about raids though, there's very little overlap between armor there.
---
Dire Maul is released. There is a better trinket from a quest.  
---
Also, I dont care if HoJ gives you 20 AP, you don't roll on HoJ as a hunter. It IS wrong.
---
Thunderclap basically doubles your defensive stance damage resistance bonus. My role as a tank is damage mitigation. For packs that can be charged it's rage well spent. Threat isn't a problem as long as your DPS isn't unloading on a pack the second you charge in.
---
I prioritized spirit over all during leveling my priest. Spirit tap is great, with single pulls only you have 0 downtime.
---
Thanks!! :D
---
Thanks, I understand what each stat does but been having trouble with priotizing.
---
There is none. Atleast not in classic.
---
Brd is good. It doesnt have actual bis other than hoj and boots, but it has plenty of pieces that are much closer to bis than the random stuff i was wearing; make sure you do the chain that leads to baelgar, its annoying but the shoulders are quite good for a quest reward. Princess runs are also worth doing because they give decent exp in low 50s, and while not bis, the ring off her and boots off croc will help dps. Do the nonelite bits of tirions quest chain too, and make sure you have mc attune done and you should be ok at 60.
---
Oh yeah, well, there were also Rogues and with ‘stuff like that’ I meant to include other possible dps fuck-ups, not specifically call out three classes :)
---
Otherwise, if a bad dps causes repeated wipes due to bad position and ability usage, that’s more annoying than having 4 capable people able to compensate for 1 bad tank, as they are usually more static, which is easier to work around ;) but it’s a matter of which side you look at it from.
---
HOJ and MS crit is even better
---
ive seen this alot in classic, but disc priest think they are damage and just sheild+renew. I dont know where this is comming from if its a retail thing.  
---
You are not alone, meetin priest not healing, i get you use shadowform you do damage, but healing specced doing damage ? why ?
---
Pretty sure it's not a bug. It's just how how worked.
---
Oh, I've got the time to play, I've got all the time in the world outside to enjoy end game outside of my work hours (which is a standard 9-5). So I can raid and such whenever, any schedule would be fine in the evenings/weekends. It's literally just the grind up to 60 that I'm fed up of, the class itself is brilliant and fun to play.
---
I think that’s what they are doing by saying “LF2M Tank/Healer”. They are *literally* focusing on finding the two harder roles to fill
---
Before, you had 0 gold. You farmed all things by yourself wich costs you 0 gold. Then you make the item wich costs you 0 gold. Then you sell it in ah for 200 gold. So  you made 200 gold profit. That's all profit. I don't see why the dude who said that is wrong. That's how math works.
---
As someone who mained Death Knight in MOP/WOD, what's the problem against DKs? It's literally the only reason that I would want WotLK for. Just curious.
---
When will you not be cannon fodder, though? Once honor ranks are in the game, they're not going away. Sure, BGs in p3 and p4 will reduce the number of people in the open world, but the ratios will still be the same (or worse like you suggested). Maybe you didnt bash faerlina, but the majority of this sub certainly did and a lot of them went to Herod, which is terribly imbalanced.
---
it's not pure speculation.
---
the spamming shield spec is a meta that begun in WoTLK due to mana return on shield break ( giving the disc priest nearly infinite mana) + removal of the CD on shield, and brought to the spotlight by instant-AoE mechanic like infest on LK.
---
You don't just randomly play a priest for 100 hour spamming shield as your main source of healing... any normal person attempting this will seriously question his choice somewhere in the middle of wailing cavern when he's out of mana after every single pull  ( + weakened soul... + the warrior tank yelling at him for getting no rage...)
---
&gt;They just play and are, too a different degree, oblivious of it.
---
that's like going on a roadtrip and never caring about gaz... I don't doubt their existence ( OP is proof they exist), I just wonder how the heck did you reach that point without ever wondering why you faceplanted so often in the past.
---
It's part of ElvUI
---
We need proof that a change is wrong if we want to tell blizzard "hey, these numbers / loot tables / animations / etc. are NOT the same as they were back in 2006".
---
If you can show us proof of a change / difference, then blizzard will most likely change it back (for better or for worse).
---
Find that video / forum evidence from 2005-2006 and show us.
---
He was talking about the tryhard race combo for PvP priest, human is it. Shadow priests as a spec already counter melee.
---
Imagine grinding without the good water
---
SWTOR has some really fun aspects to it. I loved it when it came out but the endgame was weak then still and the pvp was meh at best to me, I absolutely loved the lore and leveling process though
---
What are you? 12?  You think I care if my question is normal?  The point of my question to you was to plant the seed of not being a douche bag who rolls need on everything in your mind and every person who reads it.   The people down voting are most likely tools like yourself.
---
Yea I wanted it to be more chill but ended up syncing with the music too much haha  
---
I'll use a better and more calm track for the next one I think  👀
---
It's not about a tank wanting to respec though. It's about a dps wanting to try out tanking without getting broke in the process. I raid twice a week with a couple of days between. If I have to respecc inbetween each raid I would have to farm 200g per week just for respecs.
---
All the same, best of luck to you and thanks for the Aladdin!
---
But why so specific? In English it's like Low, Mid or High population. Otherwise one could have written *With Queues*.
---
Outside of city raids happening, no it wasn't popular.
---
Are you a mad lad and go berserker or safe guy and stick to battle stance?
---
Lol I've been using that rare elite border addon since BC, shits tight
---
I don’t remember Darnassus ever being very popular.
---
A bunch of stuff? I’m specifically asking about gear sets catered towards individual specs. So you’ve stated that you would not like that to be added. Care to elaborate why? I’m legitimately curious about arguments for or against
---
you want the rfd sword mainhand then sword of omen offhand
---
The big brain move is to make the run yourself and only invite who you don't have to roll against.
---
Now you’re onto something!
---
the bar displays with my current version of DBM but I dont have the large numbers like the OP asks about, maybe in the settings somewhere but not played around with it much.
---
do you still have to pay 900g for the mount?
---
Yeah bro and its not a problem for me. Fury and arms are both fine for threat, and while defiance is good, it's not the be-all, end-all of tanking. The other specs make up the threat difference by doing more damage.
---
In addition to boar: it eats everything
---
you roll a tank and never invite rogues to your groups
---
I tamed this bad boi at level 28 and I'll use it to 60 for sure...
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=4512/rotting-agamar
---
I taught him Bite, too... learned it from a Spider in Arathi, for an extra attack.
---
Going from 15% to 17% is not ridiculous.
---
There’s so many things wrong with this but the worst is “no instant queues”
---
Like bro, go into LFG chat and say “tank LFG”. That’s an instant queue for multiple different dungeons, people will whisper you like crazy.
---
You can check the prices and do a spreadsheet (or use TradeSkillMaster) to determine how much margin there is on the market of your server.
---
My server often has people listing mooncloth for 18-20g, runecloth stack for 1g-1g30s, and mooncloth bags go for 23-27g. I can generally get a margin of 1g85s to 2g85s by buying mooncloth off AH and making bags. The risk however is that mooncloth bags aren't selling very well yet, and there are a few people who would undercut your prices like mad, not to mention you have to tie up a significant amount of gold in materials. Make sure to set deposit duration to 8hr instead of 24hr because your margin will be destroyed if your 24hr listing expires.
---
Only good thing Blizzard has done the past few years was burning that crap down
---
also happened to me pls send help k thx bye
---
Did you give up on this?
---
&gt;I don't see why the dude who said that is wrong
---
Like I said, *you do not understand economics*. That's the issue here.

The servants in blasted lands there are 4 different ones any of them work but you want to avoid the ones in the cave because there are several at a time.
---
Freezing band for PvP is a meme. Any class that the proc is good against is already a winning match up for you and 21 frost damage is worthless the majority of the time. Cyclopean + songstone is a better combo.
---
I guess that's why you're sitting here droping this pointless comment. Someone had to do it!
---
That's still a raid. And you're still not supposed to wipe your 20man raid.
---
There has been a massive drop off in players though. This is evident by most servers having no layers anymore and massively populated ones being down to 1-2 layers.
---
So here is the story 
---
Me a paladin tank as retribution spec, an arms warrior and a combat rogue we’re doing a full Mara run we had intentions of just doing all the quests and not coming back
---
We picked up a priest for heals and a hunter for some dps.
---
I warned the others it was a full run to avoid certain issues
---
We got about half way I’d say and noticed the hunter was in melee. We joked about it and the hunter replied that he can “do more dps in melee then ranged”
---
So I checked his gear and sure enough he had a thrash blade equipped and some other green item...
---
We finally get to landslide and the mace drops with a chance on hit for 50 mana sure enough he needs on it.
---
I personally didnt really care but my other buddies were worried he would do this on everything...
---
So we finally get to the princess and our arms warrior asked the hunter to not roll need on it.. if it drops You know the scepter....
---
Now I asked my buddy way before this if I could roll against him on the scepter/Gatorbite axe we agreed.
---
Well the scepter drops, he needs it and my buddy well he pretty much lost it. My buddy ended up getting a higher roll but these two were arguing after that which resulted in the hunter leaving.
---
Sadly the Gatorbite axe did not drop...
---
I ain’t trying to badmouth hunters because I’ve met some really top notch ones but this one dam I’ll never forget this guy.
---
So as long as you do 1 boss for “tribute” there’s a chance for it to drop? That’s awesome for me cause I mainly want it to flex it (lol i actually said that- fuck me, right?) because it looks so badass- but I do think its a slight upgrade over thunderstrike cause of the stats and I’ll gain my axe passive/be able to run less +hit%
---
I'm on kirtonos as well! Horde definitely out number us. It isn't as bad as Skeram, but they out  number us something like 30-35% alliance 70-65% horde.
---
Imo enhancer are even worse because they can't do max dps in most cases due to threat.
---
This is great. Definitely trying it out later. Ogres will die to these beats.
---
Yes, I have so much trouble getting in to any groups as a rogue. I'm in a lackluster guild that is super cliquey so I haven't had much luck there either. Sucks. Thinking about just rolling a tank because then I'm needed and wanted. Don't know what else to do.
---
I love the irony when somebody calls something stupid when they have totally missed what was going on.
---
if you kept an eye on your charges its very clear faster oh will proc more.  with a slow oh i used to barely use half the charges in a 30 minute window, with fast i would sometimes have it use all the charges
---
Really you regret the grey boi? I was leaning towards the grey boi but I’ll reconsider!
---
But but... tourists!
---
FWIW it's probably going to be a pretty fucking long time until all your casters get 1, let alone 2 rings of spellpower.
---
Well you could do the exact same thing so I fail to see how that would be unfair.
---
@steenwitness
---
“As a 60 mage, aoe spec’d” as if this makes your opinion fucking matter hahahahah
---
If all you’re using to aoe is blizz your dps is likely shit. Nova FS CoC AE is super powerful and any good mage will kite and re nova. 
---
Obv blizz is great too, that’s what’s fun...choosing optimal approach to each situation to balance clear speed efficiency (no one dieing and mp)
---
Even Blizzard hates Night Elves!
---
worth pointing out that for Kazzak in particular, if people start to grief eachother... nobody will get anything done.
---
The constitution only applies to the government just fyi.
---
Unfortunately for you a large portion of us do wish to discuss it here.  So tough shit
---
Bro phase 2 isn't even out yet. TBC is years away if it ever happens.
---
Even more than some mail gear for later hunters?
---
Here, I've compiled a handy guide for where to post things:
---
Is it something that wasn't in vanilla with a few exceptions (layering, Battle.net connectivity)? Post about it in r/classicwowplus.
---
Is it something that was in Vanilla that may or may not be in WoW Classic yet? Post about it here.
---
On the subject at hand, *no, we do not want new tier sets that cater toward all specs*. We want WoW as close to how it was in Vanilla as is absolutely possible. If Blizzard decides to go the "Classic Plus" route down the line, we can discuss it then, but before that, any such discussion *does not belong here*.
---
Out of 70ish runs I did I've seen 1 Naglering, 5 HoJ, countless Banthok Sash, 3 healer trinkets and 1Savage Gladiator.
---
Perhaps you're doing it wrong
---
Thrash blade.
---
you can only use 1 heroic strike right when charing, which only boosts your damage for 1 attack
---
Sunder boosts damage for all your attacks, and costs less rage
---
Fucking tough, go and make your own group then.
---
Nobody else that also has limited time to play owes you anything.
---
When sunder armor can reduce armor it is better. But not every mob has armor, so its not always better.
---
it's mostly because sunder armor is an insta-cast spell rather than an attack that replaces an auto-attack.
---
Heroic strike effectively costs the rage cost in addition to any rage you might have potentially generated.
---
Sunder effectively costs much less rage as a result.
---
Ewww :P
---
So the answers you got are a little misleading.  Crit, in general, is higher value than hit because it increases your white damage and yellow damage.  
---
Hit alone only increases your white damage, which is only 50% of your damage.
---
However, there's is a concept of a crit cap, which reduces the value of crit for White hits.  The way White hits roll, you can't crit on glancing blows misses, or dodges (or parries).  So at a certain point all your non-glancing hits are crits and further crit is wasted for White hits.  
---
For this reason, in dungeons crit is usually higher value, but in raids hit will catch up, particularly if you go all out on buffs.  You will get an additional 16-17% crit chance and if you don't have much you run up against the cap very quickly.  That's why it's very important while raiding.
---
Who says sunder armor while lvling? I've only ever heard people refer to it as a tank threat tool.
---
Why play Nelf shadow, though? I mean, you\`ve got starshards, might as well go discipline.
---
Well I guess my best friends out fo the group lol
---
I never said it had no use. See, now that you are getting caught up you are trying to put words in my mouth. Either that or your reading comprehension is lacking. You were the one who was insinuating that if you didn't use a fel puppy that you weren't a pvp'er .... I never said you must admit the succubus is superior either. Another time you put words in my mouth. I said i prefer the succubus. You do realize that it doesn't require your validation for me to prefer something right? If you don't like her or use her - so be it. I could care less. This was to point out a funny moment of realization that i farmed my epic mount before finishing a level 30 quest for a pet.
---
FWIW the proc is much better than frostbite.
---
It's like a freezing trap that doesn't break on damage.
---
"Let's make every priest a Shadow Priest."
---
That's you right now
---
Druid tank strut walk
---
Say that to my face, not over the internet, and see what happens :P
---
In all seriousness, I stated that I didn’t know that sub existed. Now in typical reddit fashion, everyone is just obsessing over the fact about it’s not the right sub. I’m overall done with this post, but you can look back at my other responses. I am legitimately curious about the topic. I’m not asking people to cater to my whims, and I certainly don’t care what you virgins think of me
---
The constant drinking makes me go :(((((((((((((
---
The place where powershifting becomes a problem is specifically on rag. If it's timing lines up your druid can be targeted with the knockback and fuck your whole melee group
---
Some guides give more than one option (wowhead does) and you can also search for items on several databases to see what would be good.
---
The "1 best item" is only true for a small handful of items- usually class specific epic items or rare items that got a &lt;random enchantment&gt; that fits perfectly with a certain class and even then the bis you see is only "best" for raiding in phase 1.
---
Personally, I run a lot of the BiS gear with a few different pieces thst increase my mana regen so I don't have to stop and drink in dungeons but still do good damage.  Don't get caught up thinking only the items from some guide are usable.
---
There isn't a good reason. Ever. 
---
Running with guildies or people you trust is another story.
---
Druid tanks are much better at holding multiple mob aggro as a warrior you gotta work for it. Plus there are a lot of brain dead warriors that only want to dps currently in classic and don’t off tank when things get ugly. When I look for a dungeon group people first ask me “tank or dps?” And I just say either or whatever is needed. Though it is fun dpsing as a warrior in dungeons with all that cleave dmg. Melee cleave groups have been a blast and seem less toxic then the spellcleave meta which I typically stay away from.
---
Putting "free" in quotes was a good move.
---
To add to this - if you bring a druid, they will die. By the time you stealth back to the entrance they'll be about 3/4ths of the way back from the spirit healer.
---
Drain life is literally one of the most important warlock abilities while leveling. There is nothing faster for leveling than a warlock than going affliction and facetanking mobs with drain life.
---
Some of it is very good. Savage gladiator chain is nice, and there's two boots from scholomance with hit on them.
---
There's more drama over leather because there's more classes that can use leather. And no-one is all that upset when a hunter loses loot to a warrior.
---
ElvUI, questie, DBM, Clique is all I use
---
Yes.  Don't let the "I ONLY EXPECT 101% OF YOUR MAX DPS IN MY RAID" people on Reddit scare you away.  I'm currently Ass/Sub (after leveling as Combat Swords) and absolutely love it, although I'll love it even more once Phases 2/3 drop.  Feel free to PM me if you need any advice on it!
---
You have to test it. Jump a split second after the lava tick, and keep jumping as fast as you can and you can find an interval where it doesn't tick at all. I would assume there are global server ticks for lava, and if you can skip it, you don't get damaged
---
That logic just doesn't make sense though. The demand is based on how many of other classes there are and classes aren't distributed equally. DPS represent 8/8 classes, but only 3/5 dungeon spots. Tanks represent 2/8 (or 3/8) classes, but only 1/5 dungeon spots...
---
Low hanging fruit hunter joke

---
I am a rogue, and I have ran UD strat for Baron cape ***42 times***. The cap has dropped 3 times. Two of them were taken by a warrior, and one by a hunter.
---
I don't want to run UD strat anymore. I want to leave it and never come back.
---
Oh wow. I thought it was +7 to ALL axes and swords, not just one-handers. Im so glad you confirmed this, otherwise I would have been regretting the decision to buy them HARD. Theyre not exactly cheap on my server lol. Thank you very much.
---
While this is true, people should probably not take the victimized route and take the pity route. I understand people are a bit more sensitive on mmos and care what others think of them, but if someone is a dick it doesnt mean its justifiable.
---
If they gave it a bit of facelift (just and only facelift visually), then I would expect even heavy population increase.
---
Vanilla was stylish, but also fugly, even when it was made. Classic is improved, but its still decades behind.
---
Thing is, Classic (or Vanilla) and subsequent TBC are in my book about perfect games (ofc not really perfect, just close to it). There would be some things to fix, but no major alternation to gameplay, cause thats good.
---
Looks? Well, they never were good. Thats only thing that would really be beneficial to upgrade.
---
I dont expect look of CG animations from W3 or WoW, but ofc wouldnt mind if it was closer to it. Who would honestly..
---
Dps are a dime in a dozen, find a tank and a heal and they flock to you anyway.
---
Be a decent tank, friendly with the healer and communicative and you'll have a healer on call.
---
/w your healer on call "yo, wanna do x", they go "sure" &amp; you're off to the dungeon in less than 10 minutes.
---
Thanks for comming to my Ted talk
---
Do you know if we can transfer from Everlook to Celebras?
---
We find it funny so it is no problem for us. But we gotta spotlight the people who does it :P
---
You can get all the mitigation and threat talents required for 5 man's with 15/16 points in prot, and all that really does is shore up poor gear. Not going to change dps attitudes.
---
I’m just on a roll today
---
How wpuld the macro be worded
---
In your eyes same goes for recipes? If they equip on the spot who cares don't be greedy.
---
1-30 isn't bad. 33-41 or so suck then you get a mount and that's nice, then it stucks again until like 49 when you can actually start questing.
---
I find it best to just outlevel everywhere I want to quest by two levels, that way you don't have to eat after every single mob
---
Did you read the thread you respond to? First off this subthread is about guilds filling up for Ony, not 40 men random pugs. Secondly Ony doesnt take hours, neither to execute nor prepare and thirdly, again this thread is for guilds filling up, he can see it as raidlead practice for when the guild can actually raid without having randoms.
---
Definitely true, but if everyone was just joining groups asap without being petty about competition, finding runs should still be quicker.
---
Yeah... that's a joke. Just healer humor.
---
Shaman are pretty poor farmers and enhancement is nice while leveling but pretty lackluster at 60.
---
I can relate. Dungeons/combat is pretty boring in vanilla so if you're not getting gear it feels like a waste of time. In later expansions you have a much better toolkit and dungeon design so just playing the game is more engaging
---
Alliance rats attack only when they have number advantage. One on one they r friendly but if they have someone else by there side they r brave lions (rats)
---
Kazzak heals everytime he kills someone, and every time you die within a time limit your respawn time increases
---
Well when you have to spend 45-60 minutes per dungeon run and the item has a 5-10% drop rate. It does end up feeling like a job. And idk about you, but everyone tries to make their job easier if they can
---
Bloodrazor average on the server is 70g+ on AH so I’ll prob just do that but unfortunately Krol Blade goes for like 500-600g no joke..... also while kinda on topic if I had Devilsaur gear already do you priories Enchants for your BiS or save up for Epic mount? :c
---
What's the name of the unit frames you're using here??
---
That's not blackmail, that's someone charging a fee for their time/services. It so happens most of the world revolves around people doing this.
---
r/woosh
---
My bad. ;)
---
Agi = armor and dodge so it is king for Druid tanking
---
This is called gear roulette.  
---
It spices up gameplay as you never know which spec your going to fight in!   Think your going feral, no, fuck no.... resto mother fucker.
---
I see. So the mortal strike and ww is actually better than an extra attack (due to being yellow and thus having better hit chance)
---
I’m guessing you are on arcanite reaper?
---
Amen brother

The grey one is sick too I just like the strong colours of the white / green. It's a lot brighter , both the gem and the cats colour
---
Feel like you're the type of person who lanes changes every 30 seconds in traffic because 'the other lane is moving faster' when in reality if you just stayed put you'd get to where you're going faster. This is the same thing; sometimes the best thing you can do is just grind away in terms of xp/hour. You can get an addon that tracks it; so you know you're doing the most efficient thing for your level.
---
Lol crybaby
---
Most of the time the groups that are reserving all this stuff don't go past Rend, so the drops from Drakk/Beast don't matter.
---
\#Prot Pally
---
Not viable in raids
---
Cast consecrate/holy shield and judge/seal of righteousness, then go afk or space out while the rest of the party gets to actually hit their buttons.
---
Shadow priest will always open with mind blast, and because you have no taunt, they get to be the tank.
---
Is devilsaur preferable to edgemaster's in hand slot for DPS? Confused on when/where those are gonna be better
---
When you clicked that PvP server on character creation, everything is fair game.
---
Why indeed, friend. Why?
---
I see it as inclusive to an extent. Coming from vanilla, if you wanted something specific you just didnt invite certain classes or got guildies to help you.
---
With reserves, i can inv my competition if not competeing for the exact same gear. 
---
Also i might just need the quest done for attunement, but you dont inv me cause of gear competition.
---
Drain life is literally one of the most important warlock abilities while leveling. There is nothing faster for leveling a warlock than facetanking mobs with drain life. With fel concentration preventing spellcasting delays, it pulls the same DPS as casting shadow bolt while taking melee hits *and* gives you life back, which you can tap to mana.
---
How about a mage stealing the Second Wind trinket because you're a healer specced as shadow for levelling and therefore not my current main spec?
---
Where'd you get those numbers from? Sunder doesn't increase your damage that much. Go test it yourself mobs go down quicker with heroic strike vs sunder.
---

---
Planning on making more of these in the next week or so :)
---
I got all my gems on 4 runs :D
---
I can only imagine the RP there....
---
"Hello, I am rogue and I am going on an adventure"
---
"I am a warrior, lets go on an adventure together"  
---
"Oh no, we did not not prepare enough for this adventure and we died"
---
The end.
---
The other consideration is that Bloodthirst scales with AP, whereas Mortal Strike scales with Weapon Damage. I haven't done the maths but I suspect the AP scaling is better.
---
As a shaman, I put on flametongue and go melee the mobs. Doesn't use any mana or interrupt the GCD. With a shield, I'm not too squishy if I get heal aggro. It's not much dps, but at least I'm doing something and windfury and SoE will be right close to melee.
---
Or maybe when you have a job and only 2 hours to play every other day you don't want to risk losing rolls to someone else?
---
The only way anyone could say this is if they're horde.
---
I'd always rather invite a Bear than a Prot Warrior.
---
So str is not important at all? Only agi and stam (and I guess armor)?
---
Thanks man, I appreciate it!
---
hunter tailored gear typically have int and/or spirit to help with their casted shots and what nots.
---
same with shammy gear.
---
only a few pieces are good (savage glad chest say), while the majority of leather agility gear don't have that and is tailored for rogues and kitties
---
Melee weapons are essential for PvP to hunters also Any hunter who uses their melee weapon as a stat stick is a bad hunter.
---
And how many people do you know that are willing to stay in the same group for 3 whole runs of a dungeon you just completed? How willing are **you** to do that?
---
I can't do it. I can't force myself to endlessly grind the same dungeon back to back like that for 3+ hours. It's just too much.
---
I agree with your second paragraph. I was having a great time 30-40 and when I got my mount a short distance into level 40 it only got better.
---
Pre-30 I found that you were much more vulnerable to bad pulls than you were later
---
our guild uses discord to troll and meme those responsible, name and shame :P
---
You should try having a tank with force reactive tank all the adds on the pull, your locks can banish maybe 5 sec in giving the warrior time to get threat, and all your dps shit on garr. Generally goes down in around 60 seconds and you can avoid important buffs getting purged in he same breath making it easier.
---
Oh, I will. As long as I still get XP there, I'm not giving up.
---
People actually have the nerve to bitch about a tank *not* being prot.
---
This is why half my trade chat is LFG.  It’s so sad
---
Yetis in Feralas must not have received that memo I guess
---
“...find a tank and a heal...”
---
“Be a decent tank...”
---
Are you a Tank or a DPS? Which one is it in this Ted talk of yours?
---
Hi, /u/QuickBASIC

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dlkbhb/whats_the_unwritten_rule_for_your_class/). 
---
It sounded like no one needed it in his group and the hunter rolled need on it.  If your argument is, "I could have vendored it for 3g" then big woo, you can vendor all sorts of stuff.  If the hunter is going to actually use it, let him
---
&gt; You cannot mortal strike bosses
---
Unless they heal/regenerate quickly - then MS becomes mandatory.
---
I feel like there's an unwritten rule between those of us who play druids. About 99% of the time if we see another druid out in the world we leave each other to our business and I've had an opposite faction druid jump to my rescue when I overpull almost as many times as I've done the same. I refuse to kill another druid in most cases and seem get the same treatment, even going so far as to have other druids /sorry when their questing buddy decides to try to jump me.
---
I don't think that this is just because druids fighting druids is annoying because of how long lasting a fight can be. I feel like there's a mutual respect for others of the class that transcends our faction.
---
I agree. If I am a warrior but dont need a certain item but still want to join as dps maybe, I have the option v if someone just says no warriors allowed.
---
There’s a level 60 mage on my server named Watersource and he is the most generous mage I’ve ever met when it comes to providing water.
---
&gt;There isnt a better trinket for hunters then the 20AP from HoJ.. Sure its annoying as a melee but the hunter wasnt wrong.. 
---
BiS lists are routinely wrong. There are better options now for hunter trinkets. The more u know!
---
Blizz added an NPC and the "Ravasaur Trainers" in un'goro, but never added the quest in vanilla.  So it was teased, but horde never got an equivalent mount.
---
Asking people to not be petty about loot is the impossible though, will never ever happen
---
Server actually rolls 0 to 99 and adds 1 however there is a fractional part that is not shown. The winner actually had 100.46643. The fractions are newer shown. Higher number wins. 
---
It can happen with any winning roll where several players are shown with the same roll number.
---
&gt; Also this is just a picture of an undead corpse and that's it.
---
You have to read the title.
---
I did have a situation like this, but it was also our second run through, and they didnt get super crazy or upset or anything it was like "hey, we meant to tell you we are reserving the first orb for the tank, thats why they need rolled it before..." There was a language barrier with half the group. 
---
I had ALSO need rolled it cause I had no idea what was going on and thought it was that weird "always need high value items" shit people do. 
---
I happily offered to give my orb cause it was a cool group otherwise, but another dropped later so I just passed it and all was well in that strat run.
---
Weapon skill up to 15 is still pretty good.
---
Iirc that last 2 pts is worth .4% crit, .2% hit, and .2% reduced chance to be dodged.  I think that's higher value than murder or aggression or imp eviscerate.
---
You really should have included mod names.
---
Good idea ^
---
You don’t need any locks as long as your offtank can handle the damage and has the ability to generate enough threat. Force reactive helps immensely
---
This. A guild cant even Ony without randoms helping out? Well, treat them as equals and not your personal minions. Kinda scary how, judging by the comments here, this seems to be an outlandish take.
---
It sorts by instance
---
Isn't that what the other lfg and puggle also do? They filter by requests for instances? I'm just not really seeing how this is "much more productive" I'm just seeing a different UI
---
Gathermate2 addon + swapping when near relevant nodes.
---
Just don't reserve things in 5 man pugs. It's effectively making "queue times" longer when so many of these unreasonable and unjoinable groups exist, and they end up cluttering trade chat because no one wants to join the run.
---
40 man raids sure, I get it, but there is no skill and minimal effort involved being the party leader of a 5 man group and they are on 24 hour resets. Stop being shitty trying to hoard every usable drop.
---
&gt;'WEll, do you need this item?' - 'Oh, sorry then, we're full on your class'
---
When it comes to trinkets, mounts, recipes (basically what you see in the OP) it's not a class issue. Everyone wants them.
---
Default with a little tweaking is my favorite
---
It is soeculation, because we don't know if OP knows that his desired playstyle was viable way later in game.
---
You have to take OPs standpoint, but you mix in your own game knowledge into OPs. That leads nowhere.
---
And comparing the effort put into a game and real life events is just pointless rambling.
---
But by level 65ish you could replace that T3.
---
I’m just here to say that as a fresh 60 mage, the amount of pre-raid BiS and straight BiS from bosses in the BRD is driving me crazy. I’ve run it about ten times and still need the boots, shoulders, ring and trinket. I’ve only ever seen the boots drop and lost them to the Druid tank who promptly left. BRD might burn me out before I ever step into a raid.
---
Take a break. The game isn’t as cool as real life.
---
like 20 Angerforge / Arena runs?
---
You gotta pump those numbers up, those are rookie numbers in this racket. 
---
I think it was roughly 65 times before I saw it drop, just to lose to a 54 warrior tank. But at least i got to see it drop, boy that was a rush. It didn't even hurt when i saw i lost the roll. It took at least 20 minutes for the pain to set in.
---
Where are your edits? Fucking dickhead stop talking shit and go do something
---
He didn't. He's bullshitting.
---
Elemental leatherworking has some decent pieces, such as living shoulders for a healing set and elemental resist gear for raids/pvp.
---
At least on my server there are so many people with tribal LW there's little point in doing it yourself
---
Like others say, log out in an inn and take a break. I didn't play for a week and a half, and coming back was super fun. Levelled from 32 - 39 super quickly with my new enthusiasm.
---
Surely I'm not the only one that thinks reserving gear/items is just announcing to being a ninja looter up front.. I mean, is it better or worse to ninja or reserve stuff. This is like the argument of which is worse, someone that's a dick and rude all the time? Or the bitch that smiles and laughs when you're around, but as soon as you walk away talks shit about you.
---
I did this in Vanilla before they changed the rep gains and can confirm, literally the longest grind.  Thankfully it can be done casually.   I can't believe I am going to do it all over again......might as well just hand my wallet to Blizz
---
Unpopular opinion: I have no respect for leather wearing warriors. I get it, it’s BiS, but please look at yourself. Shame on you. Plus it’s shitty for PvP, so Thrall would be pissed if he saw you.  
---
Feel the same about Shamans/Paladins/Druids in dresses and other cloth... c’mon. Very wack. You look like shit too!
---
Hunter here. This guy gives us a bad name. Only reason why I would need roll on a melee weapon would be for added stats... chance on hit for a melee weapon does nothing.
---
"No on likes it." Uhhh, I'm sure a majority like it, it's the vocal minority that I've only seen on Reddit that don't like it. If enough people didn't like it like you're claiming, there would be plenty of other groups that have the same mindset that they could group with. Next time I pose the question in a group, I'll add in "how many of you actually agree to this rule, and how many are only doing so to not be removed" and I'll get back with the consensus.
---
I won the roll on the cape and had a full inventory and didnt notice :(
---
You also get less damage per minute. Which means fights last longer. While leveling you don't have any instant attack boosting moves. Thats the whole point. More damage quicker fights.
---
Damn it you're correct. Though I wasn't being pedantic. Just inquisitive!
---
Yup, Tank should get the first generic good BoE equivalent drop (orb, first non-needed boss drop, etc.) and other than that everything should be free roll.
---
That's okay... warriors don't stack Int =)
---
You could never have 100% spell hit in Vanilla.  99% is the best you could do.  It was changed in TBC or WotLK, I believe.
---
We are the best, no exceptions. Know your worth Kings.
---
I mean in 5 man's I run around in full plate because ripping aggro and dying is way more likely. But to max dps you need a lot of leather
---
Priests: You share all your gear with clothies *and* every other healer.
---
Hm. I'll suggest this to my raid leader, thanks!
---
To be fair I’ve had a good share of issues with spriest healers as a tank.
---
The cringiest of content.
---
SL locks are arguably the most difficult PVP class to beat
---
Maybe into Holy but I've seen a lot of Protection Paladins in raid gear and tanking trash. Healing on bosses though.
---
I abide by the unwritten rule if druids as a 60 resto Druid myself. It’s not cause I’m worried about the fight or that I think that the fights too tedious. 
---
We share Moonglade! We’re druids! We love nature! Hey both sides of the coin just trying to save the nature of Azeroth. I salute all druids as fellow nature lovers and move on. Unless of course they’re attacking a friendly horde in which case I have no choice but to /cry as I join the fight against them and heal my fellow faction member.
---
Sunder means less armor and more DPS, but also it allows more chances for a dodge. Which then procs overpower. Overpower is a lot of your dmg early levels.
---
RATTLEGORE STAND UP
---
There’s definitely many harder mounts to get in retail
---
&gt;So, it implies that somebody is more worthy of something than everybody else. 
---
No, it implies that one role is rarer and less enjoyable than others, so you need to incentivize people to tank.
---
NSFW jeeeeeze dat ass is THICC
---
Troll Warriors don't need to eat between fights.
---
You don’t need 8 locks just have the ranged kill the adds that die in 10 seconds. You can put an extra in melee for cleave damage and pull it out but that’s just more work. We haven’t had our melee leave the boss for 3 weeks. Works much better.
---
Basically only vaelstraz you will have a feral beat a fury tank, and thats only if he can properly chain mace use. Feral also more rng and less survivability
---
Yeah, 250 dps and drinking after every pull :)
---
I guess it depends on the context of your comment.  Most tend to base bad players off their emotional present state, or fail to look at the bigger picture. While content does seem moderately easy, carrying someone through it isn't necessarily  bad thing unless you are hardcore progressing. But in a pug you can def expect bad players, but they shouldnt punished because the RL should know what he signed up for.
---
In planning on starting this grind at 58. Did it back in vanilla, but not as mage. How many hours did it take for you?
---
Also grats! By far the best mount in-game, looks so clean without armor. 👍
---
&gt; If they target me it’s ON!
---
Well shit, I'm just targeting them to see if they targeted me.
---
Server beef ? What’d you do lol
---
Hey a fellow Westfall hordie... there are dozens of us!
---
Blizzard hasn't "messed up"
---
They just aren't being honest that they don't have the original Vanilla wow code. They've literally just been lying to us.
---
Do a search online and you can find a post of Blizzard years ago saying vanilla wow servers aren't possible because they lost the original code. Suddenly when they had potential money to make after the nostalrius shutdown they have the code? Come on guys...
---
People have been reporting so many obvious bugs with this game, especially at lvl 60. This is likely the reason Blizzard stopped the beta test at lvl 40. They did not want to encourage a witch hunt for the flaws and inauthenticness of lvl 60 content.
---
People have even reported bugs in that seem consistent with what is seen on private servers. This makes you wonder if it's possible Blizzard used the nostalrius code as a starting point to recreate vanilla.
---
I literally never had this problem, state what type of run you're doing and if someone leaves they're dicks
---
Or I’m just talking about the average players and not myself lol
---
But this idea is equally as narrow minded. It doesn't take too long to go through each dungeon and have played the game. If I wanna go to the next part of the game, raiding MC/Ony, I've gotta get my BiS gear so I actually have a shot at getting into a raid. 
---
With the example of Jed runs specifically, don't get on your high horse because people are looking for specific loot. that's literally the point of the run, if you wanted to "just play the game" you'd be going through a run of lbrs as a group instead of hunting a rare spawn.
---
Yeah. We've been here since launch. As a guild we decided to stay and we laid this reality out to our members. With the die cast, I'm happy that the alliance we do have on server fights tooth and nail.
---
People from across the server will whisper you to go find two other strangers and port them to where you are, typically for a 2 to 5g tip. Its always enjoyable to tell them to fuck off.
---
I didnt know, ty
---
metters\*
---
Three visible might pieces and quel. Not bad.
---
Forget peacemaker! Run DM North/tribute, final boss drops Barbarous blade, which is better.  Also because it's new content, you'll probably have better luck finding a group.
---
Using sunder you get waaaay more chances to use overpower. It has been explained many times and backup up with some solid math that HS is bad and should only be used if you have a full rage bar. 
---
WoW is a game tho and games are supposed to be fun, if you enjoy HS more then you should keep using it.
---
im doing your mum right now, whilst I edit
---
I've never played in a group that wanted everyone to need on a BoE when there was a player that actually needed it. You're just greedy
---
Secret
---
No one talked about fireballs, Onyxia phase 1/3 knock back attack reduces tanks threat by 25%.
---
While it's just a meme post, I would still answer you:
---
You can see the Fury asking if anything reserved. Implying that he accepts the fact that some items can be reserved.
---
But when the group is *"LFM Jed Rend runs, Trinket, Truestriker, MH res"*, then we have a problem.
---
Also the Fury warrior didn't complain, he just left, as you suggested. I don't see why you mad and telling me to shove it up my ass.
---
I do this too as a tank, it's such a bad atmosphere and I don't want to help spread it.  The loot is more important than the people helping them get it in a 15 year old game.  I don't see how they make friends in those groups, or maybe they just don't want any.
---
After a week of arena/anger farms, I passed a HoJ to the fury warrior and another dropped off the next Angerforge anyways.  Since then, we've farmed up all my pre-BiS and Forors, and 99% of his gear including Sav Glad/Lionheart/Dalrends, and none of it required spamming reserved loot in LFG.  It only required being friendly.
---
Google p99 green. New server starting from base game and following the timeline of patches and expansions up to velious
---
Amazing guide, thanks man
---
Gotta kill those younglings.
---
too many quick cuts man made it hard to follow what was going on
---
It's not a bad sword at all
---
People with low end PCs would use Darnassus  to queue for battlegrounds/arenas during TBC, because Ironforge and Stormwind could get pretty crowded during peak hours and take forever to zone back in.
---
But that's about it.
---
I’m right there with you brother, if you can find a fast group, DM:E is quick and you get the guaranteed thorium at the end with the chance of an arcane crystal, not to mention the book chance.
---
Shouldn't be hard to understand that someone else likes something more or less than you.  
---
Say you spent two weeks vacationing on a beach and everyone thinks all is well. Say you spent two weeks vacationing playing a video game and everyone losses their minds. 
---
Sitting on a beach you paid way too much money to arrive at while drinking expensive booze and absorbing that sweet cancer just to turn your skin brown? POPULAR. 
---
Playing video games? WEIRDO. 
---
Sorry. Struck a bit of a nerve. My main hobby is PC gaming. I have a 9-5, I carlorie count and own my own spin bike. I'm an average joe in average shape with an average bank account. I see people like you trying to shit on others parades and I cringe. 
---
Having no life is not a pre requisite to long gaming sessions.

It's 2019. Gaming and esports are multi billion dollar industries. People like it. Get used to it.

You looted the chest, didn't you...

You are unemployed in your name but you call others lazy because of a GAME.

&gt; You have one less bagspace and have to farm SS before raids unless you want angry nerds raging at you in discord.
---
Lack of soulwell was tied for the biggest reason i didnt roll warlock on Classic.  If i had known summon didnt drop a stone at the time it would have been above lack of soulwell.
---
I played in Wrath which had slightly larger bags and soulwell/summoning stone.  It was still annoying at times....Classic sounds kind if miserable.
---
If other high pop servers are anything like mine, AH prices are insanely inflated and keep getting more inflated every week as people keep buying out entire sets of items and relisting them higher.
---
Well be less toxic and you wouldn’t have server beef

Answer the question and I'll tell
---
Yeah a drop that both factions can get. But a reputation mount exclusive to horde wasn't added until wotlk.

---
A quick overview with more info in the article.
---
Edgenasters are trash for humans and orcs. All other races benefit from it. Look up the algorithm for how weapon skill impacts hit chance. 
---
Essentially past 308 weapon skill its diminishing returns.
---
STR is not a bad or useless since it gives melee attack power, but with feral talents you should already have good melee power, and a slight damage increase will probably not give you a significant increase in threat generation.
---
Agi helps with everything you need, though, and you have +20% benefit from stamina also so those are the best stats
---
As a horde player, I’m afraid the only answer is to uninstall.
---
/spit
---
If you are a human, than the devilsaur set is def better as the stats between the two plus the set bonus is way more stat value than edgemasters + another pair of pants. But this is contingent on using swords and maces.  
---
If you are any other warrior I’m not sure, that’s way past my spreadsheet knowledge or abilities.
---
I saw a group looking for 3M Caster DPS ONLY for Angerforge spam. General Angerforge doesn't drop a single caster item. I called this out in LFG and they started including Arena.
---
They can just give you the option to set graphics with newer models, like you have the option for OG graphics right now.
---
Oddly enough, they actually can.
---
Stick with it. Locks will shine in phase 2
---
I tried Zygor in the beginning and it was quite bad. Did they fix it?
---
Found a rogue. You love kicking them in the balls while they try to heal someone, don't you?
---
LFG won't prevent people leaving mid-dungeon run though.
---
Doing X is for Jed/Rend runs, Skipping X is for BRD, other dungeons are fairly straightforward. 
---
Full run for BRD from start to end is extremely unlikely, it's split into 2-3 parts for a certain reason.
---
"I've never experienced this therefore it must not happen"

I'm a rogue and hit 1k on level 52, then i stopped farming gold and went for more exp oriented farm.

The difference:  
---
If DPS correctly aknowledge that threat management is a group job, then the tank only has to fight the mobs.
---
But if DPS play retail-style, then the tank has to fight against group members to try to get the job done - usually with an empty rage bar.
---
Trying to tank for DPS who don't know a thing about threat adds a ton of frustration.
---
Meanwhile my alliance guild is throwing in the towel and rerolling tonight.  Enjoy your alliance free server.

I'd totally be a MT gnome warrior. Because youre playing into stereotypes!!!
---
Oh does execute stack still? Havent played my warrior/wow since the end of legion :(

We used to have a call system like that in the EverQuest guild. My mom had to wake me up at 3am once because "some guy from Sweden was calling for Pyronius".
---
1. Healer role is the only viable role for the certain classes at least for people with minmaxing mindset. There aren't a lot of druids, shamans, paladins and priests in raids who aren't healers. So if you want to play a certain class and actually care about having a place in a group or raid in PVE, then you are likely a healer.
---
2. Healer gameplay is retroactive even more than dps gameplay is. You see a health going down in your raidfraimes, you heal, you see a debuff, you remove it. Yes, a good player will utilize their class much more, but still it's way easier and less stressful than to tank the dungeon (as long as your tank is an okay one).
---
I played a bit on Mangler. I felt like the expansion release rate was too fast and the no-lifers keep things camped 24-7. Talking folks sleeping at a camp with their bot army up and a log parser to wake them up when the mob spawns.  
---
Made it impossible to get your loot organically and fucked the server economy.  
---
I really enjoyed duo play with a friend of mine, but I had hoped that the server community would be more...positive compared to p99 and it was just exactly the same.
---
Server transfers are currently only available from certain high-pop realms to certain low-pop realms. If you aren't one of those high-pop realms, you're out of luck.
---
More rage = more damage, when you get over 70 rage then yeah by all means, use a HS. Using sunder is faster. The evidence and legwork has been done FOR YOU.

---
nah dude locks are so fucking fun. i wouldnt trade my lock for any other
---
Yeah am sure thats the reason why you're 60.
---
Our guild usually stocks up raid materials and allows raiders to purchase mats directly from the Gbank for 50% of the cost of buying it on the Auction House.
---
Generally the stocking process happens until AQ40 arrives, and then the Gbank starts offloading mats back to raiders. It's akin to a tax that pays for a sort of Social Security / Pension fund for the guild.
---
If someone is that bad, 4-manning the run is usually easier and quicker than carrying them.
---
Thank god this game is old and wont be changing thru the cry babies like it did the first time.
---
That's exactly what you do. Just tank adds and burn boss. Kill them after he's dead.
---
No reason to extend the fight and increase your chances of losing world buffs.
---
You lose the buff if you take it off
---
Only for regular wow, no trial for classic. It's a fun choice and since it is still close to release, there are still a lot of people leveling and starting out fresh compared to other mmos. You just have to pick the right server.
---
I shouldn't say as it isn't widely known within the guild yet, there's going to be drama.  We've been here from the start and were also just the first to finish mc and ony.
---
This is actually pretty bad math on multiple levels.
---
Rethink this because I don't want to write a bulleted list.
---
What!!  No exp loss on death?!?  every class has an item to go to home point?!?  everyone can solo?!?  There is food/water to significantly speed up hp/mana regen?!?  You don't have a 25% chance to lose your items when you attempt a craft?!?  You can see where quests are?!?  Quests give exp?!?  ... I could go on
---
Use raid frames and expect to see about 30% of your screen. The screen clutter gets real when you've got 40 people on your screen. Probably get an add-on.
---
You'll definitely want to look into a click healing add-on for easy group and raid healing so you can just click, ctrl-click, shift-click, etc to use different spells. This is how raid healing was always done.
---
Highly recommend a cast bar add-on as well so you have a big green bar to show when to click the next cast.
---
Tl;dr: Classic healing is a nightmare without add-ons. Download all the add-ons.
---
When the photoshop matters
---
&gt;If I I’m taking my time to help you make a group you wouldn’t have unless I was there 
---
Unless you're a tank or healer your presence in the group is 100% replaceable.
---
&gt;I’m rolling on whatever I need if it’s a upgrade. Even if it means I ninja loot it and you get but hurt. 
---
If an item is on reserve you can bet the group leader will switch to ML on the relevant boss
---
&gt;This reserve BS wasn’t a thing in Vanilla and shouldn’t be now.
---
You're wrong, it was.
---
This is why I love when some noob gets all upset because a warrior rolled on leather gear... YoUr SuPpOseD TO WeAr PlaTe GeAr!!!!!! Pepega.
---
Why is it better? Explain.
---
You can't evade one of the dragons
---
Nah, I see wars and casters only wanting to do Arena. I ask: "Can we do Anger too" and their response is "No, just doing Arena". 
---
This becomes a problem because the only groups doing the Trifecta are ones where the tank is reserving HoJ or just not inviting mdps. Because they're a tank, he gets the healers, because they have healer and tank, the casters join. MDPS isn't getting into those groups. 
---
Once War has HoJ, he only does arena spam. The casters only want Arena. So, you're option is finding a healer that needs the trinket off Golem, and you know damn well their getting theirs way before you get yours.
---
Warriors &gt; everything else. They scale way better and will get a lot better use out of the gear. Honestly, rogues in end game is pretty meh in comparison past bwl.
---
Well we're 60 because we know how to pay efficiently. Sundering on the grind is just one example.
---
That can drop for either faction though. There was allegedly supposed to be an equivalent raptor mount to grind for in Un'Goro, but it wasn't implemented in vanilla.
---
If you could put together a 5 man group every time where everyone has 1 item that’s reserved for them, isn’t that ideal for everyone? It’s all about how long it takes to find a group. Obviously it’s scummy to sit looking for a healer for hours when the only healer item is reserved, but that’s just idiots being stupid. Not a problem with reserving itself. 
---
My favorite group to put together when I was farming savage glad chain was get a rogue for hoj, caster dps for the hit belt and healer for second wind. We’d go 4 man and smash it. Everyone gets the chance at their item every run. I really don’t see how this is toxic behavior or how anyone should have any right to think they should be in that group rolling on loot.
---
Yea I know I could reserve things since I play a tank but I have no issue with rolling against someone. I'm still happy for them if I lose the roll, and it's even sweeter when I win.
---
I don't need to be BiS or min/max everything I just wanna play WoW.
---
That is pvp server. You should reroll to pve, reroll to horde on pvp or try leveling in instance if you don’t want to leave your server.
---
If you can get 4-5 Sunders on a mob then yes, Sunder is better, but if you're using Heroic Strike chances are you're going to kill the mob faster than it would take to use 4-5 Sunders.
---
If you're using Rend while leveling then you're MUCH better off using Sunder instead as Rend just is terrible DMG per rage.
---
That axe is one of the few AoE DPS options a hunter has.  Their other options are Explosive Trap (can't be placed in combat, so they need to feign), Volley (1-minute CD), and then Multi-Shot and Serpent Sting, which are not going to be much on large packs.
---
However, he shouldn't roll need on it over a true melee.
---
&gt; Mages have to decide when to start DPS, who to DPS, be ready to get in range for CC, who to CC and when to avoid aggroing patrols, which spell to use for either high efficiency or high DPS, when to AOE or when to single target, when to start AOE, watch for their CC breaking, watch for important spells to interrupt, interrupt range to pull away from adds, manage threat, decide where to nova to not trap targets near healers, when to use cooldowns so they arent wasted, when to make more water so you can hand it out without wasting time, check to make sure mana gems are stashed, maintain safe range while making sure to not pull adds from behind.
---
None of this matters in any way... "when to use high efficiency or high dps nukes"? Nobody cares and nobody notices. "manage threat"? They don't and it doesn't matter, if they die the tank will get blamed and if they aren't efficient nobody will notice or care. Almost none of that list is important for a successful run. I feel like you've got a point you want to make and you are grasping at straws. "when to make more water so you can hand it out without wasting time"? Give me a break.
---
&gt; It's exactly how you get bad tanks skating by because nobody is willing to blame them for anything when the DPS is always an easy scapegoat.
---
In the group itself the DPS is almost never the scapegoat. People on here bitch about DPS targeting randomly and opening up, which they do. It's more or less ok, we don't wait for 3 sunders anymore, nobody has time for that in a 14 year old game. If there's not a skull on a target the DPS is pretty much just going to tab to whatever they think they should kill first and let loose.
---
I ended up quitting my guild because I as a Hunter lost rolls on Blackcrow to damn near every warrior and rogue in my guild.
---
You didn't, it was a go for as long as you could before you died and the next guy picked it up. It was a matter of stacking everything for dodge and using your abilities then just dying
---
nelves hate corruption, so yeah thats prob why
---
I know what you mean. I play late at night so this further increases the chances of people leaving. I don’t blame them though because I’m sitting there dozing off at times.
---
Sure, if you only do one pull everyt 30 mins (so that warriors can get their Recklessness CD up again).

One of the few sources of AoE damage a hunter can have, outside of their cooldowns.
---
2.5 bars to 60, just feel like grinding it out, any useful/profitable suggestions? Resto druid with 300 skinning fwiw
---
If it's working for you, it's working for you. I'm just saying that the limiting factor in classic is threat generation and not active mitigation, for me my method allows my dps to go ham with in reason, trash is dying fast enough that tclap isn't worth it nor does it double my damage resistance, it's a 10% attack speed slow. On a boss sure  go ahead, there has been years 9f theroycraft about tclap not being worth the rage. Just my two cents, if it works for you it works.
---
Why play DPS when you can grab DPS gear and healing gear with less stress and more groups?
---
It's brilliant.
---
I stand corrected! Didn't realize they haven't always been able to. Editing my last comment to reflect it.
---
I see, so Hazzazz doesn’t run back to his spot when you get too far from his circle path?  I was doing these yesterday and it still worked, but of course today seems to be a silent patch day
---
Right now? Kind of a dick move, especially for melee classes who won't have their weapons equipped.

No, that's the weather forecast saying it will be 25 degrees but it could also be 30 degrees, or it could be 20 or even 15. That's your forecast; we could succeed or fail. That's the literal definition of being defensive.
---
Assumptions are always the best way to post; it lets you start out with immediately showing your intelligence level.
---
In those groups, the tank was always the first death at any time; sometimes the only death.  Most of them can hold agro at a decent level.  Their survivability on the other hand...not so good.
---
Logic won’t work on people like that. Dude must be a fucking straight up moron. People like that expect group-creators to just do all the work. 95 % of this sub probably haven’t given it a try and realized how much cancer you have to put up with and how exhausting even ubrs groups can be to make.

Rogue gear is better for fury than it is for the rogues lmao
---
im very happy with my guild i have to summon maybe people to MC. more when were doing Ony but we have 5 locks
---
Because it not does only cost rage as it makes you to not gain rage on the next auto.
---
When I first started tanking this was something I became painful aware. I started to learn the "problem packs" in each dungeons. The ones that were skip-able, but which the hunter would inevitably pull every time. I would intentionally pull these and of course always get the "You can skip those" "We don't need to kill." Guess what, 9/10 you need to kill or its a wipe or a giant mess of bodies.

Go to the _classic folder inside the World of Warcraft folder, there make a new folder called “Fonts”. Find a font that you like (has to be ttf, I used Myriad Pro Bold), and paste it into this folder four times. Give them these names: ARIALN, FRIZQT__, MORPHEUS, skurri. That should do it.

Having a lvl 40+ paladin or mage would be good, in one scenario the paladin just throws consecration down with blessing of sanctuary and ret aura and everything melts while you heal and kill runners, in the other scenario you tank smalller groups while the mage melts things
---
How do you even get rage for 4 heroic strikes instantly for every fight?
---
Tbh that's kind of standard practice. There is no pre bis cloth gear in strat live, it's all leather, mail, and plate. So it'd naturally be pretty hard to find a healer willing to go along and help others get gear without some compensation. A lot of healers opt to reserve the orbs for the money/mats to use.

That's what I thought.
---
Your anecdote examples doesn't mean shit. what level are you? what weapon are you using? what mobs are you killing?
---
People have theory crafted this shit and there's various points where you sunder until a certain %, then use other abilities etc. for the rest since heroic strike is flat damage and sunder increases for all next attacks.
---
Yeah the consensus best spots seem to be lashers w/ herbalism, or doing mara princess runs (with tinker, can add rotgrip if shadow/geared enough healing spec)
---
To be fair though people in WoW especially have always been selfish with the "got mine fuck you" attitude. Even in vanilla and now in classic. But doing something like a full BRD run is a bit unrealistic without planning beforehand, whether with a guild or advertising it in advance.

MMOs should push social interaction. What you want is in Retail and It sucks there oh their doing a key signs up but never gets an Inv. Or you join one of these groups say 3 things then never play together again. Both imo bad social interactions. However when I spam for group get a whisper from someone I’ve grouped with in the past it’s more impactful. You can ask hey do you need such and such drop and work together to try and not fight over loot.

There's no tank that loses aggro to a healer... right? DPS rip crap off you but unless you are totally ungeared, you will easily out agro heals with next to 0 effort.
---
Sometimes I drain life trash for old times sake
---
Try focusing the boss this week, we found it to be much easier. Once garr goes down(60 sec or so) the add clean up is easy.
---
pay a mage to take you to dancing trolls
---
So I don't do a lot of dungeons/raids....what does it mean to reserve something? Is it like "OK if this blue drops, I automatically get it!"?
---
False. Sunder is unquestionably better than HS while leveling.
---
Heroic does a bit more damage, but uses rage and you don't generate rage for the hit.  You're rage starved while leveling so this is bad...ALSO most of your damage is white damage so sunder armor helps that and doesn't use up your white hit rage generation.
---
If you dont leave a pug in full red gear, you're doing it wrong.
---
As a druid who has two sets of gear to fill wgatever dungeon role is needed...just go for it!
---
For levels, I use the summoning stone levels, literally games reccomended level range. If worried do it 1-2 levels above that min range.
---
For role, just really go for it. Be upfront you havnt ran this dungeon, yet, but you are open to pointers and advice if soneone knows something.
---
The early dungeons are pretty easy, just to let us all learn our roles I feel! Could be hard to start tanking level 50-60 stuff after little or none tanking before.
---
You shouldnt expect a perfect run, and if you say its first time right when invited, no one else should expect that either :)
---
By the looks of a lot of people unaccustomed to world PvP in RPG games, let alone aggressive sinister playstyles (due to retail and most Mmorpgs being super easy and directed now) a lot of people will drop off after phase 2 and gb2 retail. In vanilla I never remember horde refusing to show up when 6 alliance gank you because "you started it man were all trying to quest and your causing in zone problems" or "man world PvP in this game is trash!!". So many bitches from retail lol
---
People are streamlining the game themselves but you get eaten alive for suggesting anything close to a LFG tool or any other QoL improvement really.
---
If does seem like Horde does it more then alliance. At least on the few servers where I’ve seen trade and lfg chat
---
Gnomes must stand behind other players and /dance.
---
Combat/sub is fire as well. I feel its really good for everything.
---
Yeah that looks almost identical to puggle lol. Hm, bulletin board may be a little better though?
---
Who tf would give bindings to a paladin?
---
3pt SnD, 5pt SnD, 5pt evisc. Repeat.
---
But that's for raid bosses that don't die in 20sec.
---
Just hit shop when you log in? It will tell you if you have any available.
---
60 resto Druid here. So you don’t wanna do your dungeons for pre-raid BiS while you level?  Not to worry go to the Eastern Plaguelands and start your In Dreams quest with Tirion Fordring to get your BiS healing ring. You’ll get 3 big kill quests that take a while killing like 100. Don’t forget to pickup the Larval Acids when they drop and sell em on AH or prepare to make your Hide of the Wild!
---
&gt;Shadow priest BiS guides are just plain incorrect
---
Care to share your own? Aren't they all, basically, all about stacking as much shadow power as you can while also keeping that 2% spellhit pieces?
---
As a Gnome mage I have to kill all horde I find because all of them aggressively hunt me down. If I don't strike first I'm usually dead.
---
gnome mages
---
Weak! Thanks for the info, it is by far my favorite tabard
---
I'm a ret paladin. I know. Most of my bis gear is mail or leather. I get so many people saying "don't you need plate" and thinking I'm just a ninja :(
---
Currently on this grind as a holy priest. I've considered respecing just for the mount grind, but I cant afford the weekly respec to do raids.
---
Content must relate to World of Warcraft: Classic
---
Best description of the process.
---
I am 100% against dungeon reserves, but I feel like if a guild is organizing a pug ony/mc run, them reserving things specifically to help the guild progress (The head buff from onyxia and crafting mats for future raids) is pretty normal and acceptable. As long as gear and weapons are free roll, I think that's pretty fair for a half guild half pug raid.
---
Two suggestions:
---
1. It looks like you are only parsing the LFG channel.  Can you add more channels or have the user be able to input more?  (Apologies if it is detailed on Curse.  Can't access at work).  Trade is something uncouth players use and can result in hits you don't see from LFG.  Addtionally, if people are using custom channels or guild chat is blowing up tonight, good groups can be hidden in the weeds.
---
2. If you are considering a level filter, I would recommend it be togglable or to put the level next to the name of the player posting, so the user can decide.  It is not an unusual occurrence for alts to start to look for guild groups or for a guildie or alt to post in trade chat while the leader is somewhere else.  A level 20 looking for a healer for DM could actually mean Dire Maul.  His main or guildie just may not be in a major city.
---
Can't wait to try it out.  I'm noticing the LFG starting to scroll faster than I can read on prime time and as I approach 60, I want to make sure I'm not missing groups I can heal for.
---
In concept it makes a lot of sense. It's less inclusive than just refusing to take certain classes into your group because they might roll on an item. In practice it's becoming far too normalized and abused. There's this attitude now where if people aren't personally guaranteed they'll benefit from this run then they won't bother. 
---
It makes regular groups take longer since so few want to run anything where they have to actually roll against other people. Why should they have to roll when there are so many res runs being spammed in lfg, those people don't have to. And it makes res groups take longer since not many people wanna join something where they're guaranteed not to get anything. 
---
It's just made running dungeons a miserable experience imo. Casual groups are hard to come by now, I've stopped trying to look for/form them. I don't need anything from Strat but I'd run one for a chance at orbs/greens and cloth drops. But I can't find runs where that's an option so fuck it, I guess I won't run that. Wasted a few hours trying to get a tribute run for a shot at my rings. But after constantly being rejected or kicked when I declared I'd be rolling, I just decided to farm up gold and buy it from a hunter run instead, fuck it. I was most excited about 60 dungeons but I'm already over it. 
---
The coolest part of classic wow on nostalrius was how awesome the community was. I don't feel that at all here. I feel like everyone plays this shit as a second job and they're constantly running numbers trying to get ahead of everyone else.
---
I feel you pain buddy it’s a grind but 2 weeks is not that long of a wait just be patient and farm slow I’m sitting at 7 of 17 BiS pre raid you’ll get there no one is rushing you
---
You also play a lot and have stuck to one character. Nothing to do with sunders lol.
---
Idk why youd really need to check gear on dps.  MC is all about execution, not gear.  I've been rolling with  Thrash Blade and zero loot from MC for 3 weeks and am still competitive on dps.
---
experiencing the same thing here. My girlfriend is playing a druid and she was super excited for bear form, but now she has it she prefers pew pewing things, because she doesn't quite understand rage and using it. At first I was trying to help her play efficiently but I think she is having more fun figuring it out on her own. I think she will play kitty full time once she gets that form.
---
98% cases wanding is faster than DL
---
Probably missed something. Aggro leash could have popped and transferred to horde who was dealing damage to target. I know shadowmeld cannot be used in combat.
---
I have zero issues with reserves I am informed of before I get a party invite. 
---
I have zero issues with reserves I am informed of within a few seconds of joining a party. 
---
I have major issues of reserves I am informed of after I start heading towards the dungeon, especially if I just got on a flight path or hearthed. 
---
I don’t run into these issues often as 95% of my dungeon runs at 60 have been in guild. But if someone tells me X is reserved after I start heading to the instance, that person will be on my blacklist.
---
Wait what? You make it sound like there's plenty of MC Spellpower rings going around... gonna be a LONG while before you even replace 1 of the Freezing Band, let alone 2.
---
&gt; lmao what? how did you tank AQ
---
A lot of things go into it but in the end its a truly beautiful thing. The boys over on the [Shaman Tank discord](https://discord.gg/fdsgMvc) constantly talk about raids, strats, etc...
---
I refuse to tank for any group with loot on reserve.
---
We're all participating, we all get the chance for loot.
---
I am asking so I can figure out if I should wait to make a rogue because blood elf racials are OP or if I should make a Undead rogue now.
---
2 of the best combos are... Draeni Shaman and Blood Elf paladin. Lmao I didn't play tbc and idk shit about it, gl though.
---
Just to be clear, are you talking about before level ~20? After that it's clearly best to use early rage to sunder.
---
&gt;Bindings are one of those things that even if you pug a few people, you give to who is going to get the most use out of it, not just straight open rolls. Imagine if a hunter won. This is embarrassing lmao.
---
Their guild looks like a clown show to me.  I could understand open rolling it to rogues/warriors because it wasnt reserved, but to give it to a fucking PALLY (who is at best off tanking) and then telling him he's 9th in line for the 2nd one? Holy hell.
---
Undead rogue here. Horde must kill all gnomes and as a rogue you are obligated to kill every alliance you see, especially in the most annoying way possible.
---
*avoids*
---
Warlock: You have one less bagslot
---
Try having zero instant cast heals.
---
Think that would be perfect, especially for those who like Classic visually as Classic.
---
On which basis is he going to be blacklisted? He isn't your guild slave, you haven't got any "plan" for legendary drops so unless you rolled it, ban for ninja-ing would be issued, especially since you PUGged, you can't change loot rules midway unless all others agree to it.
---
no
---
we used to queue for PVP from darn so people could no spy on us but thats about the only time i was there
---
Hakurai on YouTube has a guide, but I think it’s alliance only. Probably other guides available on YouTube
---
It’s not just reserving. Monmaxing before lvl 60 is a huge problem too. I mentioned this in another thread. I quit my server after around 10-15 lbrs runs both guild and pug. As a hunter I ended up losing every roll on Blackcrow because it was “pre-raid BiS” STATSTICK for warriors and rogues? Pre-raid??? bruh I still have the Mara reward bow at lvl 60? that’s a straight weapon upgrade and you want it for 1% hit only?? Gtfo of here with that pre 60 min max shit. Needless to say I reroofed in an RP server in hopes people are less toxic there in general.
---
The hottest rogue meme is cheap shouting the mob while I’m trying to los it. Then they just stand there soloing the mob instead of bringing it to me. Fun stuff
---
Hey guys they put in a Need/greed mechanism in for a reason
---
The reason people laugh at you is becayse you could duo DM E with just a healer and maje more money if you were good. But since your bad you need a whole group to help you get ore.
---
Spicy comment section and I didn't even have to sort by controversial.

---
r/Badfaketexts
---
Did you buy/use Joanna's updated guide on the website?
---
Personally I've had success with https://classicwow.live/leveling
---
But I use it more as a general guide rather than step by step
---
Yeah I'm planning on pooling gold and engineering materials on my main character in classic to dump them into a blood elf paladin as soon as classic TBC comes out. Honestly only playing classic to get ready for TBC.
---
&gt; On classic?
---
Yes, 3 days ago. Nothing really surprising considering how much has been learned over the past few years.
---
I help out if I am nearby. If someone is calling for help against injustice then, in my opinion for me, why not join in? Its why I rolled on a PVP server. To PVP. Sure we might lose, but its still fun.
---
Oh I got that shield already. I was shocked at how much of an upgrade it was.
---
Not really. Just remember that your stat priority is spell(shadow) damage&gt;spirit&gt;stamina&gt;int.
---
If you have issues with threat outside of getting it back in p3 you should probably replace your tank. I've never lost threat on Ony, regardless of knockbacks.
---
Isn’t the tank usually reserving orbs cause there’s nothing in there for them?
---
The transition is expensive if you buy gear from the AH.  Just don't buy anything and you'll be fine.
---
If you know a blacksmith and are a miner then you could get the materials for either pieces of the heavy or ornate mithril sets.  Not like a set with set bonuses, but they're decent and don't use materials that are especially rare.
---
Whoever is getting hit will get the threat bonus, so if you are tanking you will.
---
If mobs break of and attack a caster though, they will also generate a bit of extra threat.
---
Ret aura is a great tool for a bit of extra threat gen, especially when the tank is having slight issues holding threat or is grabbing multiple mobs at once and needs more aoe threat gen. 
---
If neither of those is the case, it's not especially necessary except to kill things slightly faster.
---
yeah so on fights that last like 12 seconds its best to fish for an overpower proc?
---
And the fire mage that started the ignite chain way out in first
---
Did your meme have a stroke?
---
Could have timed the leash well and got out of combat?
---
&gt; I'm not even sure it is would be faster to get to AQ40 from Darnassus
---
its not
---
I think people were just spoiled by private server loot tables.
---
But DL lets you farm forever without eating/drinking
---
Mages = you take the place as the new huntards
---
Agreed.  He ran the instance and won the roll.  Odd
---
Yes I think they will. Dev's have stated plainly that if enough people in the community want TBC they will release it. I know for a fact that half my guild at least wants TBC badly.
---
Always get a 2nd opinion.  Then a 3rd.  Especially if you're in Barrens chat.
---
Seal of fate is feels pretty good with enough Crit. I just hit 29% raid buffed and I’m able to compete with combat rogues, though getting a bad streak of no backstab crits puts me towards the middle bottom of the charts. 
---
If you’re able to build a 6pc Shadowcraft set it’s pretty good. A guildy rockin that as seal of fate was topping charts in a few fights against tier geared players. He said he got around 2700 energy back in a 3 hour mc run.
---
If this just reorganizes the supreme channel spam into something concise that is actually readable, then despite a few hiccups it's a vast improvement and I look forward to trying it out.
---
officers created loot rules after the fact as the run we did was just a shot in the dark - not full guild attempt. many joined the guild and now we can almost do full 40 w/ guild.

IMO, the same goes in theory for any valuable BoE item of any kind. Because it's tradeable with other players for fair value, everyone gets the same value from the item (either by using it or trading it). Hence, everyone rolls.
---
Unfortunately the truth is often “casual = bad” is a large portion of cases. Many players play to have fun, and never think of the nuances of the game.
---
While I agree you get into his situation from major flaws, they have one common root: ignorance. He just didn’t know, as much of the nuance to Classic isn’t intuitive. It’s not intuitive to think that once you get good healing, you should down rank. Stuff like that.
---
Not everyone scours multiple discords for the correct info, and even then there’s a lot of misinformation going around. For priests, their discord was rampant with terrible information and guides that weren’t good. You even now still get players in there going “hurdy dur, just spam max rank flash heal in MC until bosses are dead. If you run oom before the boss dies, it’s the dps’s fault”.
---
One of the most readily available tools regarding downranking and picking the most mana efficient spells tells you to use the wrong spell ranks. While yes, it’s technically the most mana efficient, the spell ranks it tells you to use are sub-20 spells, so you get your +healing eat to shit. (Just confirmed, for roughly my gearing, it tells me to use rank 1 renew and rank 2 heal as my most efficient versions of those spells).
---
There’s a lot of information to sift through, and many casual players aren’t interested into sitting through hours of video or pages upon pages of information and formulae.
---
100+ hours of /played means nothing since a majority of that is leveling. Even 200 hours means very little, as that still mostly just leveling. While leveling, all of that information means absolutely nothing. You don’t have +healing for scaling to be relevant. You just pick the highest rank of a heal and use it.
---
nice textbook example of a backfire thread 
---
&gt;First "actual run" through MC and bindings dropped. 70% of raid was guild. No particular plan setup for legendary drops, it was rolled on. Pally won. Later he was told any further drops will go to Warrior's as its BIS for tanking. He didn't like that and leaves guild?
---
&gt;Reminder of how different Retail is and why I don't enjoy it. In retail, he could just find another guild, whatever. Doesn't work quite like that in Classic as he will now be black listed. gl finishing your Legendary...
---
Not exactly what I was going for (unless it can hide all the extra tabs) but better than nothing :)
---
There is a toggle to hide party while in Raid I forget which tab it’s under but it’s there
---
&gt; And now, if you aggro one of a group of creatures in any zone, and then you keep occasionally hitting any one of them, the whole group will follow you across the zone.
---
A moment of silence to all leveling Warriors. This is how I leveled mine.
---
When I pull a mob and it pulls 3 others with it, I just keep running and occasionally turn and slap the main mob. Keep doing it until his friends drop aggro and run back, and the main mob stays with me.
---
he was told he would get more pieces after at least main tank completed his
---
To be fair, you can kill even a spriest from full to zero with a complete cd rotation.  Happened to me and I was fully buffed, in shadow form, and with a good amount of pre-bis gear.  He even sapped me and waited until my power word shield ran out (I was expecting him and thought I could survive it).  Couldn't do a single command.
---
tried shooting then running away?
---
Yeah, that sucks. Find a new guild!
---
What does a "*happy warrior noise*" sound like?
---
Just today one of my guildie's picked up the recipe lol. Thanks will head there!
---
It's much better to do it step by step since skipping some of these steps could be crucial later on.
---
This happens nightly on Herod (A)
---
The other day I had to leave a group because the group leader and tank privately discussed that the tank required all sellable loot. Neither of them informed the party until we had already begun.
---
Sad that this is an unpopular opinion. People want to police groups that they aren't even a part of, makes no sense
---
Nah man I don’t agree about the roll like everyone else bullshit because if they are upfront about reserving and you join and then get mad when master loot is turned on at that boss or roll on the item they reserved you’re the asshole, because they said it up front. As for the thorium veins, no he doesn’t need to share if there’s another miner because he has no reason to be there, the thorium is the incentive to get a tank in there.
---
I dont think that's an unpopular opinion.
---
Im mt and ive banned executes on ony for now lmao
---
During the Halloween event I believe a 16 slot bag drops from undead enemies level 50+... 
---
Perhaps you could farm argent dawn rep with the possibility of getting a 16 slot bag in epl!!
---
Forgot to add the long journey getting there; getting ganked, waiting for boat/zep. And then being told about the Reserved items while clearing trash, or worse right before boss and being switched to Master Loot.
---
Druids don’t combat stealth. If someone else is killing same kinds of mobs and you aggro leash towards that person, when it pops the aggro will all go to the person you aggroed towards if they’re still in area.
---
&gt;I don't think that this is just because druids fighting druids is annoying because of how long lasting a fight can be.
---
I think it starts with Moonglade, at level 10 we get used to being around each other and not attacking.
---
Then out in open world, its pointless to attack each other, we can just kite each other until one of us has a hearth timer up. So there is no incentive.
---
Yea on my rogue it would auto update when I learned I higher rank. I made a warlock and I had to adjust to having all ranks of abilities available and making sure I was using the highest one.
---
Most of the time I see that the tanks reserve the first orb and then the rest are free rolls
---
r/StopGaming/
---
It opens by default to the addons tab when you press 'O' so can easily ignore the additional tabs
---
Don't worry so much about fighting for aggro on every single mob. As a dps warrior, off-tanking one mob can actually be beneficial, if its not killing you outright, as the damage you will be taking increases your rage generation and as a result also increases your damage output. You have plenty of damage mitigation even as a dps warrior, due to being able to wear the highest armor class in the game. As long as your healer is not struggling to keep both you and the tank up, you're fine. 
---
While in dungeons there will also likely be frequent instances where you struggle to generate threat on every mob. Having a second warrior can be helpful to pick up stray mobs off of a caster/healer. 
---
People get too caught up thinking that, since they're the tank, they need to be maintaining threat on every single mob 100% of the time. This simply is not the case in classic.
---
I believe the blood elf racials also acts as an AOE interrupt and a 2 second silence if I'm remembering correctly. Making them very good paladin AOE tanks.
---
Ah you mean further raids. Well, again, he isn't a guild slave so he is free to leave if he wants to.
---
Look on one mob, HS May be better... but what about the down time? It’s easier to generate more rage if HS’s are not taking the rage  generation away from the attack.
---
I prefer to get a full bar using sunder, and then pepper in HS to dump some rage. If you don’t run out, you can stay up much longer and make shorter work of the mobs overall.
---
TLDR;
---
1 mob- sure, use HS
---
2+ use sunders
---
And a lot of people are going to realize that chain running groups for a specific boss then dropping will come back to bite them.  This isn't retail.  Your pool of players you can run with is much smaller.  Do you honestly think that people dropping after a specific boss aren't being noted?  I'm sure going to be keeping a list and if I see them in groups, I won't hesitate to call them on it.
---
If the group was formed for a goal (Live Strat), people leaving before you start the undead side isn't noteworthy.  You asked for Live, you got a Live group.  I'm not trying to downplay your post but once people start realizing that karma/reputation exists on their server, we'll see a lot more respectful groups.
---
Generally guilds only do this for their first few only attempts.  Generally the main tank and off tank get the ony head first.  But yeah if more than half the raid is a pug, reserving is kinda stupid, but it's their choice to join that raid.
---
That /who change was done directly as a response to the Census+ addon.  The way Census+ gets around it is tie the /who action to mouse clicks, but that only really works when you're dealing with actions that can be queued up and executed over time.  Your addon deals with live data so that unfortunately isn't a good option.
---
While we’re on this topic is there a way to drag all the groups together?
---
45 to 50 was brutal. I feel like at 50 the whole world opens up with quests.
---
Hi all, relatively fresh 60 holy priest here. I'm wondering how I should be prioritizing all of the wonderful BoEs that are available to us, primarily Truefaith Vestments, Hide of the Wild, and the priest DM book. 
---
I have about 450g. On my server, mats for Truefaith are ~300g (minus the 5 or so mooncloth I already have), mats for Hide of the Wild are ~300g, and the priest book is 150g.
---
I'm considering making the trinket my #1 priority, as my trinkets suck. I would rather not buy the book, but farm for it in DM.
---
My current chest piece is Robes of the Exalted from UD Strat, which...don't seem too much worse than Truefaith. I'd gain 6 MP5 and 5 +healing, while losing some intellect and spirit. To me, that means I should prioritize spending money on Hide of the Wild...
---
...and then there's the epic mount. I'm on a PVE server. How important is it to have an epic mount? And enchantments, those take money TOO!
---
Sorry for all the questions, just feel overwhelmed. My professions are tailoring/skinning, both at 300. I'm in a guild that will be clearing MC once we have the rep.
---
I need a few East coast pvp servers that are big population Alliance, I jumped on Stalagg but had trouble finding a group for anything below 30.
---
This is a good point about ranged. It would just be two, so I don't see how rage would be hard to manage. Basically a Warrior soloing with a Shaman healing and buffing.
---
Thank you so much for clarifying! Classic does seem like a ton of fun. So it would only be a subscription cost for classic or is there also a base game cost like the regular version?
---
It’s not so much a tank shortage but people not wanting to tank. Like warriors just wanting to dps and never tank. As a warrior, I’ll tank or dps, whatever the group needs. If anything I feel like there’s a healer shortage, that’s one of the few things for certain dungeons it’s hard to find. Like mara always has a hard time finding a healer.
---
I personally haven't used this but I do get prompts that titan bar isn't going to move something that is in use by another addon so there maybe an option to stop it moving certain UI elements.
---
Personally I use ZPerl unit frames.
---
I used a cached version. Its cool but i always always 1,2 lvl ahead because its design for hunters..
---
Dwarf Hunters are guns only and I don't give a fuck about BiS
---
Yea your guild  doesnt sound like they have the knowledge to distribute loot correctly. Id gquit.
---
Another good one is Anger stealth runs with HoJ on reserve.
---
1 spriest is  pretty much meta if you bring a couple warlocks. And nothing wrong with having 1 feral in melee group (for Leader of the Pack aura). Esp. a bear. Bear is best offtank.
---
This is probably not even close to what you mean but...
---
I low-key love roleplaying, but I play on a PvP sever since my friends aren't about the RP life. When I'm playing my Shaman, I float between vicious slayer of the Alliance and respectful adventurer. Generally, I leave people alone, but on the odd occasion I have bouts of rage where I just want to slay every Alliance that I see. 
---
I always indulge the urge to slay Alliance and simply chock it up as the winds.
---
"Thex, why are you attacking Alliance? We're in the middle of running the dungeon!"
---
"*The winds guide me, brother. I am but a conduit for their wrath*".
---
The line is where you want it to be.  If you don't like the reserve list someone has set out, join a different group or start your own.  Some people don't like any reserve.  Some people just want to get quests done or farm reputation.  A group of raiders trying to get the mount from Strat is going to be quick, painless, and may be able to do multiple runs.  Would I join that group as a healer?  100%.  I don't have loads of time and if the items I want or my goals align, I'll sacrifice the opportunity at the reserve items for a smooth run.
---
It comes down to the social contract with your group.  People who have too much on reserve will not find players.  People who have no reserve list may need to do a dungeon 40+ to win their piece of gear.
---
The bigger issue is that people want to think they are owed something for joining a group.  And that other players should just join to get them their X.  Whether that is with high reserve lists or new 60s demanding a geared MT warrior run them through BRD.
---
It's getting progressively worse in my experience.
---
The past week or so the usual ~ "First orb res" has shifted to "First 2 orbs res" or just "Orbs res" entirely.
---
I hope we never see tbc.
---
It’s a 5 sec stun my dude.  It is really good in PvP.
---
Don't knock mail man, good to work in 3-4 pieces and there's no competition since hunters aren't allowed in dungeon groups
---
What do you need rage for though when grinding without moves like whirlwind and mortal strike? You only really use shouts maybe rend and the rest is extra. So why would that extra go to sunder which adds like negligible damage after 2 or 3 stacks. Warriors are designed to level with mainly auto attacks you don't need full rage pools.
---
Black dragonscale armor for fury warriors is legit and somehow doesn't make it on almost any of these pre raid gear checklists.
---
If you use it with devilsaur, you can get shoulder / chest / boots and eliminate 3 frustrating farms. If you use a different pair of gloves, the optimal setup is shoulder / leggings / boots with savage gladiator chain.
---
You can also say "duck it" to the rend swords and get the bonus that you won't ever have to break it up again when you get a raid weapon. You can use Mirah's Song offhand and either buy Krol's or some other mainhand.
---
I heard that when you do Princess runs you can bring someone and have him stay in the entrance and still roll for the loot, where in the entrance is that?
---
smaller stacks sell better for many things as people do not always need or want 100 of them
---
Got it last night at kill 57. Dropped again 4 runs later for the other rogue I was running with. I swear once you get the price of gear it drops all the time.
---
I'm hoping there was a level of vagueness to how this actually applies. Since they specified Solenar, who summons adds, I'm hoping it's more "these enemies are considered a group" rather than "these enemies were sitting near each other." I'm probably wrong though. That said, fucking nochanges amirite, I can clearly remember leashing shit to make pulls easier in vanilla.
---
If you aren't able to understand EHP this conversation isn't going anywhere.
---
Was this paladin a tank? If so then it is also his bis.
---
It would be neat if the screenshots also included the minimap.
---
There’s no amount of gear in Classic that will make the benefit of these potions negligible. There’s no reason to not use them except for being poor.
---
I'm also a level 59 tank and have had the same experience. Feels good, bro.
---
Guilds seems to be relatively isolated from the community, but my server seems to have this community of players that are either guildless or in small guilds with friends and such. Once I started farming BRD and DM, I started coming across a lot of players that I farmed SM, ZF, and Mara with. The best part is I try to take a leadership role in all my runs and give strict instructions on when I'm pulling, when I want a sheep pull, when I want a hunter to pull etc, and to wait for my 3 sunders before doing full DPS. A lot of these repeat party members are already with the program and it's great.
---
He will find another guild. Ypu should too because giving first binding to a paladin was a massive mistake.
---
Shit had one try to charge me 3 gold for water the other day. 3 gold for spent mana ....ok.
---
Why would he not be prot if he's running only dungeons now?
---
You gotta be one seriously confused pussy ass little bitch to go around in a video game trying to threaten people with a fake list that every single person in game will adhere to
---
At least you're self aware
---
Does it make sense to use a sword main hand and dagger off hand as a rogue?
---
"Play however you want... also fuck anyone that does the things I dont like"
---
- /r/classicwow
---
Did they patch that out?
---
The goal is to try to get 30-50% pre-BiS. Not be 100% BiS. Unless your guild requires you to have a certain quota, I'd prioritize certain pieces of gear. A lot of classes have good BiS guides on WoW Head, with optional pieces. If you can get a few optional pieces and a few pre-BiS you'll be good to go. A lot of the options are better drop rates. The difference between pre-BiS and optional pre-BiS gear is negligible, and keep in mind the goal is to replace all of it with actual BiS gear. 
---
Don't burn yourself out over gear.
---
As a gnome rogue that has matured, I’ve learned to pick and choose my battles more selectively. I used to have a similar mindset to yourself, but now I pretty much only go out of my way to kill undead and orc rogues.
---
Yeah I’m used to asking if I can roll need on greens or BOEs and people just saying need if you need. Still prefer to ask out of courtesy.
---
For people downvoting the guy above presumably because they think he's wrong, I got my mace from the vault. It can drop there *and* at 7 Dwarves.
---
Not it's not. Your numbers are made up. Over at the warlock discord someone someone did that math and drain life is significantly better starting at lvl 30.
---
Do you know if any racials change from classic to TBC? Do humans get the racial that acts like a PVP trinket? And do taurens Stam buff go from HP% to Stam %?
---
Tbf, a warrior can roll on a bow as a stat stick. But chance on hit weapons usually have no stays, so if a hunter rolls on a chance on hit melee, he’s just an ass hole.
---
Haha flipping mats on Benidiction Ally is what some of my friends are doing as well
---
1 to 2 sunders under level 20 adds 1 or 2 damage. 1 heroic strike adds 21 damage.
---
Lady, I only speak two languages: English and BAD English!
---
Deadly boss mods tells you how many times you’ve killed a boss every time you kill it. I’ve had it installed since like week one. So I know exactly how many times I’ve run a dungeon for each piece of gear I don’t have yet. It’s torture.
---
I have a chat parser addon that is able to pull the level data from people who post in /lookingforgroup, so I know it's possible. No idea how it does it, but it posts their level right by their name/message.
---
Yeah that's basically what I'm getting at.  They can form dedicated parties and just grind it out, generally balancing their composition optimally too so everyone gets the best shot at their loot.
---
Wait isn’t general sword main hand?
---
Im Horde in Blaumeux and i can answer your question. Most of the people on our server are higher level now. Leveling my alt and most of the people i see are 40+. SM is poppin at least for horde, then ZF will be the next dungeon that people are doing. All the low dungeons, RFK, RFD, ULDA, and ST have hardly anybody doing them. 
---
ZF at 44 will be then next dungeon you will be able to easily find a group for, then Mara after that.
---
Okay, I'll do that. I'm excited, tyvm for your help :)
---
Just do lbrs/ubrs/scolo/strat/DM for your pre bis and don’t worry about leveling.
---
Reddit say: not orange! Orange man bad
---
I guess I'm still confused how +5 bow = 3% hit.
---
Or are you saying the +5 helps GET to 3%?
---
I leveled my warrior to 60 in 9 days /played. I want the first or fastest on my server by a long shot, but i know how to play the class. If you're tripping ascot what's the correct rotation to be using at level 8, then whatever, yeah i was using hs at that level too. 
---
Once you get more of your toolset available, hs drops off in effectiveness very quickly. Its a rage vacuum, think of it as costing about double what it says on the tooltip. You use it when you're at 50+ rage, at which point the extra damage is worth the dump since you'll have rage available for other things.
---
It's much more effective to spam hamstring and sunder on a mob to fish for overpower procs, which are a free extra attack, and likely crit, if you're arms.
---
The lowish level rotation generally works like this:
---
Charge, bloodrage (if available), battle shout (if needed), rend, spam sunder until the mob is at 50%ish, overpower whenever it's available, build rage for next mob, bandage when combat ends and then charge next mob.
---
Once you get to the mid 30s and learn whirlwind attack:
---
Charge, blood rage (if available), battle shout (if needed), zerk stance, berserker rage, whirlwind (whenever up), sunder (when ww is down), switch to battle stance and overpower whenever mob dodges. Build rage for last few hits, then bandage/charge next mob.
---
You should only need to bandage/eat every 3-4 pulls and have very little down time doing this, especially if you stack spirit gear.
---
My guild used it as a raid staging ground a handful of times because it was always empty. No one to rat us out.
---
It’ll just reverse to one drop of water on a mound of pee and poop. Every Mages ignite goes to one mage-bro
---
Right but if you aren’t grinding your ass off to min/max with BiS leather pieces while fighting 3 other classes for them, are you even trying to play classic warrior?
---
Did why the fuck would he raid with if you explicitly told him he wouldn't be getting any gear?
---
You guys are stupid and I would quit too
---
Master loot
---
You're missing the point, but that might be because I haven't expressed it very well. It's a roleplaying game. That means when I play the game, I'm not me. I don't have a computer, a bank account, a credit card. I'm an orc warrior, a human mage, or whatever. I'm not even an RP gamer. But I at least respect the fact my character has a story and when I play the game, I am immersing myself in the world and 'forgetting' about 'real life'. 
---
So, to then take out my credit card, pay some money and magically something appears in this game world ... it has no explanation from a roleplay point of view. And to me, that makes it completely worthless. If I grind a mount, it has a story. My character has worked to earn the trust of a certain group of people. Or I have killed a boss and successfully captured his mount. That is rewarding to me.
---
Fast offhands are usually the best until 40+ (when you get sword spec).  Higher chance of poison application which is where a large % of your OH damage comes from.
---
There is absolutely an incentive to ending battles quickly, and I think you’re right - not many druids want a 3 minute slug fest where you might be aggroing other mobs or running into other players either.
---
Which two class combination are perfect for duo Dire Maul runs? This would be for gold farming ideally.
---
Yessir, those are the items I am running. But the gloves are the only epic item I have. So it's not like I can just ditch items right now :)
---
But thank you. I will work that into the items I need on. With 310 daggers, what kind of %hit am I looking for?
---
Warriors benefit the most from that leather gear. More than any other class. They should be gettin it before anyone else if anything.
---
That’s what I said
---
You definitely are
---
If the melee don't need it, then the hunter can get it for those times to contribute.
---
Volley and Explosive Shot aren't dependent on melee weapon, anyway.
---
I made half my mount money on GMW's. Everytime I was at the AH I would price check GME's and if they were under 12s/each I would buy and send to my alt.
---
I had to make 300ish of them at 40. But it was easy money
---
That’s horde ya folks
---
Just subscription cost at 15$/ month
---
OP never get married. This will up her resistance to suck. -999 suck.
---
This is why specifically I ask if anyone is new and say it has been a long time for me. It helps to know someone is new and treat them well than to assume they know and wipe because they didn't do something you expected.
---
I highly doubt there going to tbc. But I mean optimism is always nice. The devs have stated the stuff if there but have also stated they don't want to release the same content. We're more than likely going to see a classic +
---
Just to clarify, I took a peak at that BiS list and it should be almost exactly what you want for end game 2h fury (minus the weps ofc).  The set shown there for Orc Warrior, gives 9% hit which is what you should be aiming for.
---
As a rogue, when questing with other rogues - I’m gonna pickpocket every single mob I can get, good luck.
---
A root is often as good as a stun against the classes affected by it, and you're still talking about needing 2 of them for a 2% chance, while sacrificing as much as 300 HP. There will be times it procs and it saves your life, and there will be times it doesn't proc &amp; you die where and extra 300hp would have saved your life. It's a tradeoff that I dont find worth it.
---
Besides, phase 2 is world pvp only, and if you played in Vanilla before BGs released you'll remember hat world pvp was an absolute clusterfuck of DPS from range where you're not taking many melee hits...... and warriors with healbots that do not focus mages.  If the rings are worth using for PvP they're far better for BGs than world PvP.
---
I personally never saw that hat drop.  Armory was annoying so I only did it a few times.  Shoulders dropped every time for me.  But yes, it is a good alternative.
---
If you're a druid you have to either tank or dps.
---
Don't forget we need money for buying food for our pets, so any BoEs are ours as well.
---
how about dps people burn the casters/ranged down first 
---
the amount of times i see whelps being last to die in ubrs is way too damn often 
---
it will make your healers/backline/tank so freaking happy if you get rid of the little shits first every pull  
---
hitting casters also improves your dps on the meters because you will hit them for more for the meter hungry retards out there
---
Luckily they are likely the tank/healer and won't need you.
---
Oof
---
Thank you! I feel like I’ve already made a mistake getting all my abilities. I luckily found a guide for my talents (?) I think that’s what it is.
---
54 for hunters
---
Yes, _sometimes_ used interchangeably with "Deadmines," not with "DM."
---
Unpopular opinion: I prefer people calling out what they reserve in the lfg message. It’s effective communication. You are wasting other people’s time if you decide you aren’t gonna invite a rogue etc. 
---
That said. I understand there are people who post a ridiculous reserve list, just ignore them. I only ever reserve a specific item when it’s the only thing I want from that dungeon. If more than a few bosses drop something I want I don’t mind a small competition(say another caster dps and sometimes the healer) because I know I’m not going to run it just once.
---
In the end, that's worse. There are lots of players that would be excluded by that system that don't even need the reserved item.
---
Saying "LF DPS, casters only" is far more of a dick move.
---
Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
---
More productive from the standard chat. It's just a different addon that has a different feel. Choose whichever you like
---
Wow-head has it as Brigam Girdle and Battleborn arm braces.
---
But a lot of that could depend on what other gear you need to reach the hit cap. If you change one item that can cause a ripple effect where you shift what items do and don't need hit.
---
So I’m a 43 warrior orc and I just bought the Boots of Avoidance for 25g w the idea of reselling for somewhere over 30g but I’ve seen multiple people say the boots are serviceable tanking even @ 60. Is this true? Should I just hold/use?
---
What part of execute do you think "stacks"? it's an instant attack dealing damage.
---
You sound jealous.
---
Wow I've literally been brainstorming the same addon. Beat me to it.
---
its good for some ret builds (Seal of Command). the only way Ret's are actually viable is using tons and tons of spell procs - and procs that proc other procs... Windfurry procs all the time - but it's a pipe dream, because NO GUILD IS DUMB ENOUGH TO NOT HAVE THE LOOT RULES CLEAR ENOUGH WHERE A PALLY CAN GET THE BINDINGS. 
---
if the guild messed up, then they need to own it and see it through. i would maybe say no open rolls moving forward for Other players - but be clear..., but that pally should have a chance to complete what was started.
---
lol so tru ;) she is a super duper sucker! you go gurl!
---
Is that some weird way to insult people?
---
"You have a job! Haha!"
---
Nice...just what I expected from the aforementioned losers.
---
I've played with 220 latency before and it wasnt a big deal. I would imagine as long as your not the tank or healer no one would really notice your latency being higher than theirs.
---
Eh? Unintelligible nonsense. To be expected from horde filth, to be sure. It would be great if you quit before reaching the horde endgame of harassing people 20 levels lower or jumping on your betters while they are fighting other mobs or if you have a numbers advantage. Soft brained cowards and freaks, the lot of you.
---
Said someone who has no idea what it takes to lead a raid / guild I assume.
---
6 points in improved blizzard and permafrost, have cold snap and improved frost nova (9 points total I think) Also pick up ice block, barrier, and the crit and damahe increases. 
---
If you are the guild guy everyone is counting on for winter's chill, you gotta put 5 points into it. if you aren't, you can still pick up clearcasting with those talents and save 5 points from not grabbing winter's chill, which only 1 person in the raid needs.
---
What role do you want to run it as? I ran it as a level 52 DPS last night with no problems, Id say right around there if youre dps.
---
Why quit at 1 alt? Surely you can level every class and then relax :P
---
+30 spell power affects healing too?!
---
Aged Core leather gloves end up being the best for a long time because they are the best item with Dagger skill until the Cthun dagger.  Prior to having ACLG, the mugger's belt or the distracting dagger work as well.
---
The hyper min/max people will say that you can drop a point in weapon expertise, but in reality there is no where else to put that point.  YOu can move on to aggression, but the extremely minor times you SS or Evis don't result in anything but the smallest of dps increases.  In reality it doesn't really matter if you stay at 2/2 weapon expertise.
---
The tolerances on fights, especially the early raid fights, is very low for dps.  BiS lists are cool for setting a guide and working towards something, but trying to create one set that is the de facto best and all work should be towards it is a waste of time.  As the raid tiers move on, the item choices get narrowed and require less thought.
---
In general, Agility/AP are the primary stats you want.  Hit will be on a lot of the items.  As long as you have some hit on the gear you will be fine with the weapon skill, but don't worry if you start to get a lot, it just happens.  In general 1agi is worth about 2ap, it's not exact but as a quick reference.  Try to minimize the amount of worthless stats you have on gear, like spirit.  Crit is actually not overly important.  Don't ignore it or avoid it, but in general most slots have items with better stats than crit.  Also you will be getting a decent amount of crit from agi.
---
One thing to note, most of the purchasable items on BiS list aren't usually worth it.  Devilsaur is really the only thing, but I've seen some lists telling people they HAVE to get a Krol blade or Alcor's sunrazor.  You don't have to go that hard.  MC raiding is not that furious where you have to have all of this shit to be useful.
---
I am completely wrong. I keep looking by all star points. Thank you.
---
Awesomely funny your guild is a bunch of clowns lol
---
Sure, and Rogues have full threat reset. Warriors have highest combination of raw damage and lack of threat reduction abilities.
---
What the fuck is the difference between 15 up front and 2-4 greens and reserving a 25-30g orb? 
---
Alot of tanks have no real farm outside of running dungeons. Seems like a fair trade to me. You get your items and they get some gold.
---
A stupid mistake is putting it lightly. This is egregious. This is like spitting in someone's face and being mad when they didn't thank you for it. OP made a post purely to shittalk the paladin, and I guarantee only didn't mention names because it's not allowed. It's one thing to recognize your mistake, try to rectify it between all parties, and leave sleeping dogs lie, but OP isn't doing that, OP is acting like they did nothing wrong and somehow you'd need legendary item experts to take 5 seconds to google something, and trying to justify blacklisting someone for not wanting to deal with rampant stupidity.
---
Yep, but OP is talking about falling behind. It seems he cares about being current with the top of his server. I think by the time AQ40/Naxx comes out, there will be a very small raiding population left that is actually able to clear. Everyone else will be too casual, or part of a guild that is half-dead. So if he wants to be current by phase 5/6, he needs to commit to a progression guild **now**. Maybe I'm wrong, but I think I'm taking a conservative outlook on the raiding livelihood in Classic by those last few phases.
---
You'll 100% fall behind just doing pug/mc's that either have bs LC's or do free rolls which are RNG.
---
Like having 3-4 pieces raid BIS and rest pre-raid BIS vs someone in 70% bis raid and the other 30% pre-raid bis, is huge differential. Depending on the class it's like a 10-20% dps difference.
---
this is just blatantly incorrect; warriors don't need to prioritize hit as much as you say
---
Do the Onyxia Attunement and farm Prebis ;)
---
The whole reason I stayed a priest main because ONE GUY in a dungeon run back in WoD complimented on my lack of over healing and good use of leap for best positioning and such. That one compliment goes a super long way. Havent stopped healing since
---
Read just now:   
---
Looking for 1 dps and 1 well geared tank and healer for fast live runs orbs are reserved.   
---
Really, you're a mage who doesn't have a group and is just greedy.
---
This is where the fun begins!
---
What is up with you people thinking reserving super low drop rate items is "pathetic and toxic?" You can still get literally any gear that drops that isn't that specific item, so just join if you need anything else from the run. It's not like they're the only ones getting any benefit, they're just running for something specific. If you're not going for the same item, who the fuck cares?
---
Reserving everything? Not okay. Reserving something like HoJ, where you can easily find group members that need other items from the run? 100% fine. Don't like it, don't join. Just don't bitch about things being reserved if you don't even need them.
---
&gt; Also, from my experience feign death can not be resisted at all if you have a big distance between you and the mobs + being behind LoS.
---
I thought this was true until one of my runs today. Had two pillars worth of distance and a pillar between me and King. Now I have no faith in anything. On the bright side, feigning that far away allows you to buy time for the next feign by dropping off the ledge and forcing King to walk back and forth. You may have to Tank Cho Rush a little but he can be wing clipped and stuff so that isn't too rough.
---
How does knowing what is needed cause inflation?
---
No warrior will ever roll against an hunter on Barbarous Blade.
---
Repay the favor and leave Satyr's Bow / Blackcrow to us.
---
So your solution is to just be the person who forms the group and set whatever rules you want? You don't see the obvious issue with that when it comes to applying that concept en masse? 
---
Groups can't function that way, they require some people to not be completely selfish. If everyone did that, the system wouldn't work. And the more people who do it, the slower the system works for everyone else affected. You're that asshole who drives on the shoulder during gridlock and thinks he's clever for doing it. You're not clever, you're just willing to be shittier than other people. Congrats.
---
Shadow Priest confession: the 1st run I join each login is for Mage Water, the gear if I need any is an afterthought.
---
&gt; Disc priests are not viable in classic
---
Well thats just flat wrong, in fact if your raid group is running only deep holy and not a mix of PI/Holy they are leaving a lot of DPS on the table. Disc is absolutely viable in classic and is preferable in many scenarios. It just doesn't play like OP thinks it plays.
---
Do people not fish for Jed?  I can’t imagine just running in and hoping for jed...
---
idiot
---
No problem, have fun
---
52-55
---
Except Arcanite Reaper. :P
---
Plus that's going to cost a lot for the tank to repair
---
this guy gets it
---
Sorry, when I say not worth contesting, I mean it's not worth the effort to successfully tag and down the boss, relative to the loot it drops, multiplied by the # of people in your raid contesting said loot with you.
---
It doesn't matter. Darn exalted grind is like 5% of Wintersaber grind.
---
This explains why I barely got killed by a mage 8 levels under me with 0 resists on any frost spells.
---
And then you take one knockback and threat switches to another fury warrior. Onyxia spins 24/7 and sooner or later she breathes on raid for free wipe.
---
Lfg
---
I like how you got mad that he's had a different experience than you then projected the argument that he thinks it never happens.  Dude even said "if someone leaves they're dicks" and you even put an edit complaining people are replying without reading posts. I love the internet.
---
Whining about whining.
---
That’s the cool aspect of classic.  I actually had a guy come up to me today and say oh shit you’re Hetz from Reddit
---
It is also about their threat generation of which there is no better sword than that.
---
i disagree.
---
jsut because they made a stupid mistake and allowed a paladin to win the first half doens't mean they should make a second stupid mistake and also give him the second half.
---
I'm mostly surprised more people didn't quit when faced with such incompetent leadership...especially the warrior tanks
---
That's fine, do whatever you want with your vacations, and let other people do what they want as long as they aren't harming anyone else
---
why is this concept so hard for people?
---
What sucks is that as a Tauren druid myself, I have had a statistically worse history with Nelf druids than any other class. I have stopped to help and be helped by several alliance characters, but every time I have EVER come across a Nelf druid, they try to kill me.
---
This guy doesn't know shit. Don't listen to him. Benediction is POPPING and the faction ratio is very balanced.
---
Sounds to me like you all were salty he won the drop and made some bull crap rule half way through. 
---
And when he rightfully gets upset and leaves because of your new rule, you try to punish him even more by black listing him for not taking your crap and leaving.
---
Then you post on reddit looking for positive reinforcement to make sure you're in the right. But you're not, you're just a band of people salty over losing a drop, that went all mob mentality on your guild mate.
---
The meme reserve runs taking an hour+ in LFG to fill would beg to differ.
---
What would you consider "literal garbage"?
---
I still don't understand how some people consider spamming a macro in trade chat for 30 mins in IF a healthy player interaction. As a pure DPS class u either have to create party and spam every 30 seconds the same buttons, waiting for that tank to join. That or have to filter manually all those spammy messages in LFG chat for the dungeon u want, only to get denied in the end because some1 from the other DPS that are looking for group managed to get invited, 1 sec earlier. Or spamming every tank if your friends list if they wanna come and tank.
---
No changes, no problem, but don't say thats player interaction.
---
yeah but 2/5 people either dont use it properly or dont understand the concept of Greed
---
Where can you target the boss from? I have heard conflicting reports if you can target him from the entrance portal or if you have to go up to the UBRS door.
---
&gt;not many druids want a 3 minute slug fest
---
Woah woah hold on slow down there speedy, we aren't a middle aged man getting an unexpected afternoon delight from a loving spouse.
---
3 minutes into an open world druid on druid battle, we are still just getting past the Hello, and starting to see if the other one is any good.
---
Your guild's first mistake was giving a fucking binding to a paladin.
---
Your guild's second mistake was to fuck him over out of being able to create the item.
---
You deserved to lose him, and your guild sounds awful.  Reap what you sow.
---
The reserved loot runs cut down on group options that players have in general. You don’t have to care about the efforts of another player trying to gear up, but what you’re doing is essentially gaming the system by circumventing the inherent fairness of a /roll system. 
---
I am of the opinion that reserved loot should happen within guild groups, and PUGs should follow the normal loot rules of Need/Greed. 
---
Yeah, it happens anyway to an extent by controlling who you invite. I get that. All I can say is I don’t play that way, and anyone that comes into a group I make gets to roll for the loot they need, no matter if it competes with me or not. 
---
It’s just different perspectives I guess. But you’re looking at it solely from the perspective of people that “agree” and join you versus the people shut out from that group who have to choose between not joining or not getting a fair /roll on an item they need for their time given. 
---
Just my opinion.
---
How do you go beyond the max level? Is it an item or consumable? Racial?
---
Woooooooosh!
---
I love how you missed the mark so badly.
---
Effectively sunder does less damage then heroic strike. Its trying to factor in the fact that heroic strike doesn't generate rage on the next swing. It doesn't matter. Still does more damage.
---
That means that you have good dps, not that you have good tank.
---
Some of our warriors are fury/prot and are duelwield tanking certain stuff. They put out a ton of threat, hard to match without a pummeler.
---
Example, I don’t recall mars farming as warlock to be as lucrative or popular in vanilla. Etc.
---
Raw gold farms, more players etc.
---
Dual specs wouldn’t hamper the economy much, keep the price at like 1-3k and everything would be fine
---
It wasn't long. Less than 2 months.
---
Depending on server economy it can also be better gold per hour to have someone DE items to sell. Large brilliant shards are about 1g50s on my server which is about 50% more than some of the blues vendor for.
---
It generates rage all the same. DPS is most important.
---
I’ve been dual wielding since level 20. I can’t turn back now!
---
But wouldnt muggers belt along with Devilsaur and 5 set bonus from T1 be better? or am I completely off?:) Thanks a ton for the great reply btw!
---
&gt;My server is pretty dead on Alliance side so it's pretty hard to get a grp for strat to get peacemaker.
---
now you can try and make a group for tribute to get Barbarous which is even better
---
Loose
---
Our server had a rogue trying to setup a ony raid with bloodfang reserve. He spammed half a day.
---
All rolling greed builds trust between the group members - this connection might improve group performance were there to be a pvp skirmish later on.
---
This. Been healing using clique + grid since wotlk and I don’t think I could go back to the old way
---
Why would they die?
---
The hardcore dont reserve because the hardcore are running things with guildies, gearing each other's alts out at this point.
---
What you mean to call them are quasicore scrubs.
---
Oh.. so it is messed after all.  Went to boost my friend in stockades as lvl 48-50( cant remember exactly). I pulled 2 first rooms and got fucked in moments.
---
The fact that you didn't understand their point speaks volumes about you.
---
Completely and utterly wrong. Anyone who's trying to min-max are already done with these dungeons well over a month ago, doing guild runs, and if they're on an alt gearing, they're almost certain to be doing it with other guildies who are on alts too. There's a big difference between min-maxing and being a toxic elitist, and the latter usually isn't that good of a player either. Private servers were nowhere near as toxic as retail classic is. I don't know where this toxicity is comming from, but it's certainly not from min-maxers or the pserver community.
---
Crazy how both of those are solved with......making your own group....
---
Some people are just lazy.
---
I've only gotten ganked while fishing because another angler wanted my pool
---
I can tank/heal.  I'm 51 right now.. so I guess I'll wait until I'm 52.
---
If he just face pulled and then hit cower that might have worked. Wild guess though
---
&gt;It isn't better than Satyr's Bow or Blackcrow.
---
It is. Crit is prioritized higher than hit for both rogues and warriors above the yellow cap. Why would you have warriors prio hit in their ranged when they're *forced* to have hit in other slots that don't have viable +crit alternatives? Strikers mark is just better because it comes with 22 ap instead of 6 stam.
---
You're literally lowering your hunters dps giving them that instead of just having them run strat/lbrs.
---
Popular opinion, people think that theirs matters.
---
I’m happy I was well ahead of the curve, i didn’t have to deal with this as much while gearing up.  I ran into it from time to time but way less groups were doing it
---
Mate, I was playing Alliance when I started. Pipe down and get back in your box.
---
Same people who want your Netflix/hulu/hbogo/spotify login because "You have like 2 extra log-ins to give away bro, don't be greedy."  
---
As you said, they simply don't value the time of other people.
---
When I first played WoW, I wished there was an LFG tool. It’s something many of us wanted in MMOs. But sometimes you have to experience change to realize change is not always a good thing. Some changes are bad. Other changes are good. WoW does not need an LFG tool (I realize you are not claiming it needs one). 
---
LFG tools have their advantages. They are convenient. They make grouping and gathering your group quick. But they get rid of a lot of open world activity. In classic, we have to run to our dungeons. This gives the opportunity for more open world interaction. People are constantly moving around and not just teleporting from cities to dungeons and back. 
---
I am a big fan of open world pvp games. I am not a big fan of instanced content. I can understand the need for instanced dungeons and raids (some games don’t instance content even today) given that WoW Classic is still a theme park MMO in many ways. Instancing makes sense for WoW. But if we combine it with an LFG tool, we will kill a lot of the open world stuff we see today.
---
They can in retail. Not classic.
---
I think there are region tabs at the bottom of the realm selection menu
---
Any thoughts on bears. They’re pretty common yet no one brings them up.
---
From my personal experience, you could spec 0/0/0 and most guilds will be fighting each other to bring you because warlocks are in high demand as opposed to mages which are extremely numerous.
---
It was always DM-Deadmines, DME,DMW,DMN for Diremwal East/West/North.  Least when I played.  But we could argue until we're both blue in the face, no one will win and coming to a consensus here is not going to change everyone in game.
---
Quick question regarding itemization for Elemental Shaman
---
Roughly how much spell power is equivalent towards 1% Crit chance? I'm having a tough time figuring out what gear I should be looking for at 60 weighing these options. 
---
I know that Crit gets better with additional spell power and vice versa, but how do I contrast equipment that has 1% spell crit versus say 20 Spell Power?
---
horde, simple typo i didnt catch. lul
---
So you get to play An amazing solo class and only have 1 other person competing for your mail gear in raids. Sounds awful.
---
Race are ya dude?
---
No, it's supply and demand. Not many tanks, many fury warriors.
---
Depends on the server, Firemaw EU and the rest of the initial servers all host most of the hardcore players. 
---
Meanwhile on Dreadmist EU I rerolled around 30 and am levelling a Druid and a Hunter in parallel (35/36 now), and all the zones are packed. Even with layering.
---
As a shadow priest that loves to heal dungeons, I make sure to show up to the dungeon out of shadow form. I get complements all the time on my healing, but there are still muppets out there who think shadow priest spec can't heal end game dungeons.
---
EDIT - a word
---
Yes there are, there's nothing for tanks tho. Strat live has neck/back/recipe. It's super duper easy to find healers and clothies for Live, tanks however is a different thing.
---
Gnome warlock is best for PvP as well. Gnome warlock is the master race.
---
Don't go enchanting, it's a money sink and works well on bank alts since you can de any level item. I'd go herb &amp; tailoring or herb &amp; alchemy

---
what about troll rogues? do you reserve those bros? :D
---
&gt;Crit is actually not overly important. 
---
I agree with everything else you're saying but crit should be your highest prio once you're yellow hit capped. You'll need about 11 agility per crit for it to outweigh just a +1% crit on an item.
---
&gt; I've seen some lists telling people they HAVE to get a Krol blade or Alcor's sunrazor. 
---
I just recently brought a Krol Blade and take it from me, the difference between it and thrash blade is definitely a big improvement, but I was still clapping asses in MC before it with no issue staying competitive with higher geared people.
---
Yup. I am so very jealous! You see right through me.
---
Or they have limited amount of time to play and want to be efficient with the time they do have.
---
Sit down kid.
---
When I was 12 years old back in vanilla I lvled a warrior to 60. I was totally oblivious that I choose a harder class to level. It was just fun for me. I even barely understood English as well and had to ask my dad for help when someone /w me or if the instructions on thotbott lacked coordinates.
---
So no, I have clearly not only played hunter.
---
Where you even born when they released vanilla?
---
not only do mages 4 man zul farrak for exp, level 60 mages also farm it for 50+ gold/hr
---
Hah, yeah, there was actually a famous hunter in Vanilla who had Vis'kag and Felstriker. Avatar/Serennia, amazing player, huge douche.
---
A: Orb's are worth 25-30 gold on some servers
---
B: Jump runs are not as lucrative as you're making them out to be, it can be argued that running around azshara is better for mining. 
---
C: Not every warrior is a fucking miner
---
D: Maybe hes tired of jump runs. Same shit gets old.
---
Look if you think anecdotal evidence is enough to declare specific percentages of decline in the player base, I highly doubt you're going to let someone on Reddit change your mind.
---
That being said if you're willing to look a bit deeper try and figure out why your /whoing isn't relevant: you're not doing these 'checks' frequently enough to gather a true idea for the baseline, your already miniscule scope is further reduced when you consider your checks are in a single server during a specific time frame.
---
You shouldn't divine numbers from purely anecdotal evidence, and you REALLY shouldn't attempt to make those numbers seem more valid by using them when debating a topic.
---
Fuck phase two .. quit rushing things
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YlsBuBIgvA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YlsBuBIgvA)  Here's a good guide on it. It can take at most 2 minutes for you to target him if he's up as he patrols in his room.
---
&gt; Not sure why we needed another thread on this.
---
We need a psa at the top of the sub or something because by just scanning through the comments of multiple posts on the front page, I've seen numerous posts already crying about reserving loot.
---
Thanks :) so in the end it seems like I actually have to invest into premiere xD
---
You're in the minority
---
Bro some people are messed up. I had a mage in zf group a couple weeks ago spaz out and leave cause the healer wanted some water. The mage gave him a couple at first like 12 or something then when healer asked for more he lost his shit and ported out.
---
No considering, she's my gf
---
Just once? Happened to me three times last night. Won the hat in SM cath and the neck in SM cath. The third time another person rolled and obviously beat my 1
---
I posted a link, this is correct.  The math says this mage who probably doesn't even have a 300 defense skill, getting missed by things 30 levels lower ~12% of the time is normal.
---
Cape and neck in live for casters
---
does it have a minimap icon?
---
I don't remember all the calculations, but it basically goes like this:
---
The biggest problem for melee DPS in hidden damage reduction is glancing hits. These are calculated by a comparison of your weapon skill against the opponent's defense skill. 308 is the amount at which increasing weapon skill no longer has an impact on the likelihood of getting a glancing hit. It still decreases opponent's evades (dodge/parry/miss), and IIRC it slightly increases crit chance, but the priority on going from 308 -&gt; 309 is a lot lower than 307 -&gt; 308, so getting equivalent power gear with other stats will generally be a better upgrade.
---
I heard Blizz broke WRobot couple of years ago. Hope they'll keep working in this direction.
---
What are you hiding?
---
I hate to break it to you, but as a fellow tank; get over yourself.  You're the one being an asshole; you've got your gear score, and your mythic all lined up.  You're just playing classic to get there.
---
&gt;Not everyone scours multiple discords for the correct info,
---
but even if they don't... isn't mana efficiency self-obvious?
---
as a hunter you probably don't care too much about the mana efficiency of mend pet, i'll agree...
---
but as a priest, when a third of your spell book is filled with lesser heal, heal, greater heal and flash heal... who only differ in term of casting speed, heal amount and mana cost...
---
how do you manage to play a healer WITHOUT ever even questionning that?
---
Like, it's not magic the gathering where you get a new card with 'banding, flanking' on it, then go look up the 12-page definition of 'banding' in the official rule book just to think about how this card can combine with 1'000 other card in a 1'000 different deck...
---
This is like buying a car and not knowing wether it's a manual or automatic.
---
Yeah reserving that kind of shit is a very selfish way of playing the game. Just roll on it when it drops, like the game is intended. I’ve seen the Savage Gladiators Chain drop twice and lost the roll twice, same with HoJ. I just move on a run it again hoping for better rolls.
---
Well this question is directly answered by the pre raid bis and bis overall guides. People have done the math and already figured this out.
---
This answer to this question directly correlates with what level you are, what your current crit and attack power you have, what current gear your using, and what weapon type you are using. If you want you can look up damage calculation formulas.
---
If you want to go full powerlevel mode you could try out mage AoE grind.
---
Simply search for those three terms and maybe add "wow classic". Plenty of guides
---
rogue gear is bis for every melee dps class, basically. And hunters.
---
Shit sucks. itemization in classic is whack.
---
I don’t understand that persons rational. Mages are supposed to give water to everyone. It doesn’t cost anything, just some mana. Lol selfish prick
---
I think academic grading is often too harsh on languages. In reality, what matters the most when it comes to languages is: are you communicating effectively? If so, you're fine. You have mistakes in your post, but the formalities of English don't really matter; I still understand the entire thing just fine.
---
Garbage sword that's overpriced. Nobody with any amount of game knowledge would ever drop the ludicrous amount of gold idiots are trying to charge for this. Grats tho. Hope you didn't pay for it.
---
Could also be Gnomish Invisibility Generator.
---
Puggle does this too. Also allows you to edit the dungeons tags so you can see obscure runs for instances under that instance. Like if someone is spamming "lfm save princess run" you can make it show under BRD.
---
Dude. You're the perfect level and the perfect class for the best grind in the game. Go to azshara and go to the blood elf camp with blood elf surveyors in the North Central part of the map.
---
They have like 2k hp and are all spell casters so they have almost no armor and you can take almost no damage if you interrupt their casts. 
---
You can grind them all the way to 60 and itll be pretty efficient and pretty good money. You can also stop by the nearby satyr camp for felcloth drops
---
I guess it depends on your stance on loot. Some people think you should only ever Need roll on your (pre-raid) BiS items. The exception is that if perhaps a drop is an upgrade and NOT needed for anyone else's BiS list, you simply ask in the party chat before rolling. Should someone object, well there's a conversation to be had.
---
If that was the mindset, rogues and warriors should only ever take Satyrs and Blackcrow, unless rule B applied. And visa-versa with Carapace/ABB for hunters. 
---
I sure as hell agree ABB is sexy.
---
If you are on the alliance Allyroute is amazing, follows you step by step l, and isnt overly complex.
---
It depends heavily on weapons. If you have a big, slow 2H like you should while leveling, then you're missing out on a fuckload of rage every time you use HS. You're also missing out on the free instant speed attacks from sunder, which gives you chances at overpower. So it's not just flat damage per attack (which sunder probably comes pretty close to matching HS anyway), but also adding in all the rage lost from not generating on HS hits and fewer overpower chances.
---
No worries, was genuinely curious if it was possible.
---
Didn’t you guys have to scan peoples PCs in order to ban Buddy users? It was so sophisticated by the end of it I don’t imagine a script could catch individuals, only if you notice same people running the routes.
---
Hell the only viable way I saw of tracking down buddy users is to use it yourself and look at the popular routes.
---
Of course before they shutdown everyone began selling private routes to prevent exactly that
---
Any addons for tracking Shadow Trance/Nightfall procs?
---
Happened to me twice last night! Had a third 1 roll but others rolled too
---
Ever tried farming as a tank spec? We farm party members in dungeons instead.
---
Same could be said for arena farm. Healers don't need anything from Arena. Never seen a healer reserve garbage loot for their services.
---
I think for Strat live in particular, reserving an orb is fine. That's 45g on my server. 45g + random loot will probably net you 60g for an hour's work. That's not bad. Reserving everything that no one needs is just greedy and unreasonable imo, but maybe that's just me.
---
Why do you have a point in aggression? 310 weapon skill still has great benefits.
---
Still more threat and ony doesn't hit hard, am deep prot for MC fights where I need to be for my guild at this point with the gear of myself and my healers.
---
Usually end up with 30k threat with shield on ony p1, 50k threat dual wield ony p1 just spamming heroic strike, sunder, and retaliate.
---
if he's a semi-decent raid leader, kicking/replacing bad player like this guy entice the good one in his raid to stick around (atleast, if I was pugging it would).
---
I mean undead rogues are our counterpart. I’m just doing my part in maintaining a harmonious ecosystem by rolling gnome warlock.
---
Do not use that spec btw. The guy is a bit clueless.
---
Diet and exercise, we know you can make it!
---
What is the name of your guild?
---
Because your guild is fucking stupid for even allowing a pally to roll on it. 
---
I would sooner blacklist your guild than blacklist the pally....
---
Preach gaming!
---
For example, a warlock and his pet.  You can't pull the pet from the warlock NPC.
---
Some people just don't care about being resourceful.
---
I convinced my parents to let me play EQ by once explaining that I was actually playing with a dude from Scotland who had to briefly leave to go tend his sheep.
---
About 3 days. I bought 660 stacks of runecloth
---
I've been collecting my spell damage set so I can do big balance damage  when I see multiple groups that just need dps lol.  It's not too bad in dungeons when you just double dot everything and oom yourself every pull
---
Entitled is the word coming to mind
---
You MUST re-level engineering from the start.  You will NOT get any quests from the normal quest givers when it comes time to choose your specialization, at that point you must reed Soothsaying for Dummies to choose your new specialization.  You can do this right now, it's been in the game since launch.
---
This is the dumbest logic, it’s bis because it slightly gives you more ap. When it legit is an amazing item on melee. Gtfoh
---
Retail players riding mounts that they bought with real money are basically riding a beacon that shines "I am an idiot" brighter than a trillion quasars.
---
Who doesn’t cleave on luci
---
It really isnt that bad though. A hunter would get way much use out of it than those 3 gold would ever do for anyone else.
---
Such as?
---
now that DM is out, I don't believe this is true.
---
ACG &gt; T1 gloves, and T1 belt &gt; Mugger's, thus you'd used AGC and T1 belt. Shoulder, chest, wrist, belt, and boots will get you 5pc, you'll aim for t2 pants/helm.
---
Was this on blaumeux? I'm there right now and theres a troll mage behaving exactly like you described
---
&gt; I abide by the druid code, unless it's a group battle in which case cow druids are fair game.
---
Fair enough. Me too.
---
Gorillas don't have thunderclap either. All they have is an aoe ability every minute. It doesn't apply any debuffs.
---
Here's what Owls have that gorillas don't:
---
* Better damage modifier
---
* Better AoE threat
---
* Less damage taken via Screech's AP debuff
---
* Better mobility via Dive
---
* No cooldown on aoe ability
---
I always rolled gnome specifically to put players like you on tilt. I honestly wish my friends had rolled horde for classic, but here I am - once again a gnome.
---
"ST" is confusing the add-on; some people recruiting for raids commonly use "ST" to refer to server time.
---
Because people expect others to do the work for them without a care in the world. It's called narcissism.
---
Lol at not understanding people are all making their own jokes.
---
Sorry bud, you're pretty much just wrong here.  And from reading your other replies it doesn't seem like you want to think critically about this, you just want to "be right" - a dangerous attitude to have.  
---
The opportunity loss from having to spend rage on a hit that would have otherwise generated rage for you is tremendous.  Both because the additional damage is not that much, and also because you are rage starving yourself, making your subsequent pulls start with less rage than you had before.  Don't be fooled by phat yellow numbers.
---
Sunder lets you continue to generate rage, it makes you do more damage, AND it can proc overpower.  It is by far the superior way to level up, which everyone in this thread is telling you, and which you are refusing to hear.
---
Why come here, get a consensus, and then immediately discount the consensus?  Seems pretty dumb.
---
if its a kill quest, why would you not want to group?
---
If you read the tooltip, you'll see that poisons proc on a % chance. 20% of hits for instant, 30% for deadly etc. That is very straight forward and can't be misunderstood or overcomplicated. X hits * 0.20 = number of poison applications. Faster weapon = x increases.
---
Yea ok, you made the argument that any tank not doing perfect optimization for gold per hour is bad at the game. You're completely changing your tune now.
---
The whole "do what keeps you playing the game" mindset has caused me to just give up playing my Rogue.  Twinked the *hell* out of an alt and I'm playing him now.  It's annoying when I cant even get an invite to a group because the Warriors want all the leather drops.
---
Everything about the way druids interact with the world seems unintuitive lol
---
you got it backwards, you want a slow mh and fast off hand for more off hand hits during the slow mh heroic strike swing
---
Edgemaster is always better for gnome/dwarf and the mc crit gloves are bis for human unless your guild lets you go daggers then ancient core leather gloves are bis
---
Either you play a rogue or you are clueless, since you say you're not a rogue we already know which one it is.
---
Are you a gf?
---
Lol bots can see the mobs in an area and target them or avoid them with highly precise movement right outside aggro range
---
Ive found that as long as I dont have to stop to eat, I can grind until my eyes fall out comfortably. Put on some good music, find a good route where you dont have to wait for respawns, and just *go*. 
---
It helps a lot if you've played an actual grindy game before for comparison. Makes grinding whatever in WoW so much easier.
---
He's a human anyways.
---
Hamstring into overpower for vastly more damage?
---
As a hunter I approve this message.  Mages, stack crit and avoid stamina.  You can definitely avoid being hit.
---
Hunters of today, yesterday, and forever:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-3e0EkvIEM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-3e0EkvIEM)
---
It's so pretty...
---
What server are you on?
---
If cloudkeeper are on the bis list its not right
---
Is this sort of thing common? I haven't had a single dungeon group that has failed to finish anything with the exception of one Uldaman run where we couldn't hit the final boss. Is this a server-by-server thing?
---
HOJ? Hand of Justice, the trinket?
---
They are making a joke since you suggested spamming dungeons after OP said they don't have time for dungeons.
---
Probably iphone users happy to have something to use their 900$ camerabrick on besides food and themselves.
---
I’ve always felt like trolls, Tauren, and dwarves are bro’s
---
Can you math out the dodge chance for mobs then and how many hamstrings would it take to get an overpower proc on average? If you can show that fishing for overpower procs via hamstring is better dps then I'll concede my point.
---
But the OP's question is strictly HS vs Sunder, and I have explained and provided the calcs to show when exactly it is better to sunder vs HS on a various sample of mobs; and generally, it is better to HS. Given the data, a good rule of thumb would probably be to sunder once, then HS afterwards if you're fighting any given nonelite mob.
---
Auctionhouse addons play big part in this, people just put things in AH and it automatically undercuts the previous prices and if you dont pay attention this happens.
---
Or the ubrs portal is camped by 15 of the other faction and they can't be arsed to keep corpse running. Still worth it to corpse run imo, as literally every caster and healer is after him. But some people are hella lazy.
---
Healers shouldn't be wasting mana to heal warlocks that spam life tap unless they have an agreement.
---
Nah, it means “looking for help from people without conflicting interests. If you need anything ELSE from this instance, this groups for you”. I don’t see how that is something that pisses people off. It’s an offer or a request, no one is twisting your arm and making you go support them. THAT would be healthcare as a right, or slavery.
---
Gather your friends and simply slay them.
---
Honestly I think the OH speed is unimportant and it should just be the higher DPS weapon
---
As a broke level 57 warrior - what is the best way to farm  Foror's Compendium of Dragon Slaying? Getting QS has been my sole goal of Classic. I was hoping to be a little further along with the BiS grind before DM came out... Is there a fast boss farm route? Do I just bribe my friend to let me use his rogue to stealth farm Dusty Tombs? In vanilla I ran DM-W to no end and never got it. I know it is at the will of RNG, but how do I play the odds? Excited to get this book! Any help/vids/guides to speed up the farm would be helpful!
---
I would assume he's prot...
---
a ret paladin would use a 2 hander.. or a nightfall?
---
Taking an objective perspective:
---
**PROS**
---
- Everyone going in knows beforehand whether they will compete for certain items or not, reducing the runs they need to do.
---
- For reserved items there is no loot drama regarding ninja looting or unspoken priorities
---
- Less competition for shared loot means more loot will be needed, as needs will be better distributed
---
**CONS**
---
- Takes longer to find groups in general, as fewer people join/invited to groups where there may be loot competition
---
- Higher chance of loot being needed in general = higher chance the group dissolves after one run, due to tendency for players to leave after getting what they needed.
---
___
---
To me it looks like the consequence of this trend is clear; less loot is going to waste, but fewer runs are being started and fewer group involving multiple-runs are being done. It's hard to say whether the result is better or worse.
---
Not my experience so far. Turn about is fair play after all. You gotta be willing to return the favor.
---
Yea the dropp chance is like 0 so I was happy to atleast have some chill runs, now I have to tryhard my ass off and most likely die
---
Ah I see, that's a good reason to farm it! I'm trying to find bis lists for later phases and struggling to find that information.
---
You missed the joke
---
prot paladin thrive on spell power.
---
Ecin
---
faerlina when the streamer dick riders aren't on(you know, after high school or middle school gets out) the server is legit dead, no messages for an entire hour on lfg, low level zones completely dead. you are very wrong in assuming the game will have a strong lifespan, the beginning of the culling has already started
---
St’op
---
Given every single person I've seen to state this still takes fuckloads of lava damage they're really just talking out their ass.
---
&gt; I had to point out that this rogue could simply pickpocket BRD at 40g - 60g per hour
---
Is it really that high? That's kind of nuts. Is it just jail circles then reset?
---
This happens to me constantly too. Only on my alts, not on my main. Using SimpleUnitFrames addon. It's very frustrating.
---
I also came to the opinion that most are just farming the meta/popular methods - so there are great quantities of items not everyone needs and all the sellers are competing with no buyers present, this prices plummeting.
---
That was a dumb reply because I just explained it's one button in a previous comment to someone else. There was even an xp leveling glitch in BC that using it. You can keep coming back but I don't give a shit lol. Show me how much you care about this argument and keep commenting back or just shut the fuck up, either way I win you fucking scrub
---
Where is the AH in darn?! Lol
---
*Ex - girlfriend
---
I make reserve groups with a tank buddy in sub 10 mins

How many more gear pieces you gonna misloot in the sake of learning? Do your research ahead of time before you screw over your raid members with your incompetence.  Your guild just lost half a thunderfury because it doesn't have its shit together.
---
If I was the MT, I would run far away.
---
Yeah that’s a good point. I feel like when it’s reactionary though, it’s one word stuff: “adds” “mana/oom” “wait” and that kind of reaction is honed pretty quickly. Anything much longer than that you’ll have the time to find the right words. When I played on Latin realms in retail that was my experience, anyway.
---
Reserving items is the stupidest shit I've ever heard of. "Hey, run this dungeon so only I can get loot". Its all about the tact. "LFM UBRS, PST If you dont need [insert item]" is 1000x more polite than reserving an item. The entitlement in classic this time over is disgusting
---
Don’t respec yet unless you’re prepared to go healing, AoE isn’t going to be any better. I would recommend a combination of questing with grind in ZF and Ulda. It’s not the most fun sometimes but if you spam Ulda to gear up here and there and then spam ZF you will be in a good place. You can try your hand at Mara as well then you should have quests open up in several zones. I’m Ret at lvl52 currently
---
You’re right I haven’t. I don’t need to play a shaman though to tell you with 100% certainty that going Ele from 1-60 is slower. It’s basic logic. If you’re drinking more often than you would have too otherwise to kill mobs it’s slower. If you go enhancement you won’t drink as much and you’ll still kill mobs near the same rate or faster. So yeah enhancement is always faster.
---
I’m not trying to shit on you or anything, but it’s not really a big leap in logic to realize that drinking less would be faster in leveling. People don’t play druids but I don’t ask them if they’ve ever played a Druid when they tell me feral is faster for leveling. It’s fucking obvious.
---
Play the way you want to play. You do you. But enhance is faster faster objectively speaking.
---
Just curious, you don’t think this is outdated after one month?
---
Yup, I've gotten a lot of this, since I'm one of the few tanks and healers at 60 on our server, and I get whispered constantly. Have plenty of people who will instantly invite me to groups, and that's been my primary way of getting into raid teams. The pool of 60s is pretty low, so if you prove yourself to be particularly good once or twice, you'll quickly find yourself in high demand.
---
It makes perfect sense actually. Plate armor would hinder mobility and flexibility, traits a damage dealing barbarian warrior would favor.
---
I don't think a rep was tied to it, though I could be wrong as I can't verify on my character. It was the original version of the current BFA Horde mounts where you did dailies or the 4 battle pets in Legion.
---
whats the problem? i just opened a website to tell me what items to grind for.
---
Priests can solo those but it takes forever. Smite, smite, shackle, smite, smite, shackle, smite, smite, shackle.
---
I used to love warcraft lore (played all the games, read every quest, read the books, etc). Illidan in TBC is when I stopped giving a shit because clearly Blizzard did too.
---
The key is timing your arrow and right before they hit the target.  With some practice, your arrow hits less than theirs so you get tag while they get agro
---
Unlike the time for freedom which is not on Blizzard's clock.
---
&gt;If you're a druid you have to ~~either tank or dps~~ heal
---
I generally don't join parties that advertise with "xy reserved" and with full bis and half the raid gear I don't really care about item drops. I understand that farming a dungeon for 1 item that you have to roll for with half your group sucks but I find the attitude suuuper off putting.
---
I should be happy with that respons? if I ever want to pay anyone to tank for me I will whisper the guy spamming tank service in world chat.   
---
You seem to think that I as a healer have 1000 ways of getting gold but you don't see me expecting payments.
---
If you're in a situation to make use of the proc, then you don't want to move anyway.
---
Yeah I just saw the thrash blade I will for sure pick that up, was wondering can u enchant thrash blade and what would be best for maximizing dps
---
No...it's actually that bad. It gives no stats and you need to be in melee to use it. It has marginal utility that's quickly outscaled when you get a decent ranged wep to fuel your autos/multi.
---
Hi, Super Nintendo Chalmers!
---
You can always pay me the newest version , son.
---
Except if it's reasonable you can, it just ensures every party member is there for a different piece of gear, everyone gets the item they want with no competition and everyone's happy. It's when people reserving stuff get greedy or excessive when problems happen
---
Got mine for 180 off AH. I'm on PvE so I suspect that plays into the cost a bit, but all posts for gloves are between 60-70 and all legs are 120-130.
---
They're not.  An actual 'bot detector' would not talk about their methods, ever.  The amount of false positives these 'anomaly events' would produce is humour-worthy.
---
That being said, the technology we have to produce bots nowadays is far more mind-boggling than the ones described in this thread.  The issue is that there's not enough machine-readable-recordable human data to actually train them, which is why they're not around (or maybe they are, but they're that good no-one can actually tell).
---
Winterspring too. The pristine yeti pelt and the perfect horn or whatever took me like 3 hours of straight grinding them.
---
?
---
early game.
---
If players dont want to join groups that have reserved items, then dont. And if more players stop joining those groups then it becomes harder to put a group together that is reserving an item(s). So we meet an equilibrium of how much time it takes to form a group with reserved items based on how many players are willing to join one. Dont forget that there is a downside to forming a group with items on reserve, it should in theory take you longer to form that group, thats the price you pay.
---
Theres nothing wrong with the looking for group interface in retail.  The main problem people have is with dungeon finder which auto makes the group and teleports you.  The LFG interface was made in BC after addon(s) started providing it in vanilla.
---
&gt; For what a joke?
---
Depends on where he is on his "asshat" quota with her.
---
Didn't know I needed to have a wife + kids + a house to suddenly be qualified for having a life. 
---
I mentioned my situation as an example of being able to mitigate most if not all bad effects of long gaming sessions as well as have a job pay taxes etc...
---
Why do you find someone taking personal time to enjoy their hobby pathetic may I ask?
---
By making friends, networking and finding a tank/healer first.
---
Finding 2 other DPS is easy...who cares that you found 2 DPS?  Find a tank or healer and you've got something to work with.
---
indeed.
---
if anything this speak more about the guild (lack of) leadership. taking the easy route of ''oh well, we'll let everyone /roll on it'' instead of enforcing common sense.
---
Imagine being as insecure as you are, holy fuck. You don't need me to keep coming back to set you straight, your life is already shit out of control as it is. 
---
I'm laughing at you. You're pathetic.
---
Nothing that impacts the actual game. Just a small little tourney.  
---
Also extremely tired of seeing Tips, who is a complete fraud and a horrible human being, getting shares on here.
---
Or you could just have better FR gear.
---
lolwut priest leveling is baby food. if you're speccing anything other than shadow that's on you.
---
That is exactly the problem. You don't even know whether that website is right. You don't know why it chose the gear it did. You just blindly followed it. How will you ever decide what is your best upgrade going forward? Website?
---
They're entitled because they're in demand. That's really all there is to it. If you don't like it, then roll a tank class yourself.
---
You should be fine to just continue doing what you have been doing
---
Na I didn’t learn any of those
---
I think telling someone to "calm down bud" is weird
---
Give us Kael'thas as the leader of the b11 and some nice interactions. I think he was wasted as a raidboss. I thought with his story in wc3 he would be more important
---
My opinion on this is not to slow down your leveling in order to farm for a mount.  Yeah, you may not get your mount until level 44 or 48 or whatever, but you'll have those levels already.
---
Simply because they’ve never needed to concern themselves with mana efficiency for the 150-200 hours of leveling.
---
Even then, it’s not a concern much of the time for dungeons. I’m fully aware of and utilize downranking and know most (I won’t claim all) nuances of priest healing, yet I often forego trying to be properly mana efficient in dungeons. I’ll use max rank greater heal almost entirely. It allows me to tab over and play some Terraria between heals.
---
If I’m able to heal improperly (knowingly) with ease, I’m sure less informed healers that are lacking experience may be doing the same. This can easily lead them to never even consider concerning themselves with proper mana management and spell selection.
---
Remember: what may be blatantly obvious to you (as a presumably experienced player) isn’t so obvious to the average player. The average gamer is actually not very good or knowledgeable.
---
Off hands have nothing to do with heroic strike swing timer. You will get more hits with your offhand while heroic strike is queued if your mainhand is slower than your off-hand.
---
For those unfamiliar with the situation. If your heroic strike is queued your offhand will be granted the same hit chance as a yellow hit instead of it's normal penalty.
---
Totally agree with you.
---
I love how that is the universal explanation. I’ve never heard any other example but “The red car” lol
---
I report people for spamming if they post the same "LFG" line 3-4 times in a row, like with a macro. This has the bonus of temporarily putting them on ignore.
---
I'm not going to sit here and argue about this, but I'll say this. In the text she's clearly speaking about her character in WoW as a warlock, in which she is sucking the life out of things by combining the three spells she listed. I made the joke about how she is doing the same thing in real life. :)
---
Faerlina server first 60s were 5 man dungeon grinding by 4 mages and a priest.
---
Once he got the first binding he should have been top of the list period. However why would you let a paladin roll?
---
I have my left binding on my rogue...hosted a pug said it was open roll before, so rogues/warrs rolled. Now that I have left if someone got the right ahead of me I'd be livid. 
---
If someone has one half they get the other it's just good sense. RIP for letting a pally roll on it though.
---
Have you done Hinterlands, Feralas, AND Tanaris?  Are you caught up in STV?
---
&gt; no pre bis cloth gear in strat live
---
shroud of the nathrezim?
---
Great, now you called me out!  
---
Um...go to the big temple thingie.  Before you get to the top - like as you are going up the ramp - go to the right.  It's, well, there-ish.

As a tank I always feel like I'm carrying dps.
---
Mostly because I don't even have the room to make mistakes because the dps always fuck up first
---
You either res me the orb or I'll find another run in literally 2 minutes.
---
Shpeak*
---
4 4 4 4 4 (re-position my character) 4 4 4
---
Change that to rends eyepatch or white mask and it would be spot on.
---
Imagine saying cut it out. And "thats a dangerous attitude to have". Who are you again?
---
You're fine just play and have fun
---
Not until you tell us what you did you sneaky bastard.
---
I'm so glad people are realizing HotW is the good spec, after most websites didn't even put it up as a talent build to consider.
---
Like, your a human right? You have 5 sword/mace skill, so you only need 6 hit. You should be cutting 3 hit from your gear to do more damage with AP+crit.
---
But you don't know that, so you are literally wasting 3 hit.
---
&gt;  Paladins wear plate,
---
lmao
---
Yeah exactly you get the herbs I’ll get the ores it sounds like a symbiotic relationship to me not like 1 taking advantage of the other.
---
Probably crusader but it's expensive dude
---
There's a few quests in Hinterlands in the lower 40s.
---
Aside from that, good level to run ZF.  Get your carrot on a stick!
---
a roll getting thunderfury sounds legit... MT priority is more common ( because threat cap is a thing) but assuming it's the 2nd set of binding your guild get, I wouldn't be surprised about it ( well,surprised at the RNG gods favoring you).
---
1% chance against a rogue is fairly significant.
---
Yup. I'm a hunter and it was basically the best grind spot in the game for me.
---
Only reason I say rogues are probably better is that they can kick the casters spells so they can take almost no damage where a hunter that isn't high enough level to one shot the mobs will probably need to heal their pet occasionally
---
Oh *I* know that, but these people get all pissy about how it's "better" for DPS so they should get priority if  say that. So I just tell them I'm DPS main spec (which is true).
---
Even if the 55-60 LFG isn't that active.
---
See like 3-5 unique groups/minute (and a lot of these are waiting 20+ minutes to form the group). Which is a huge cry back from when you had nearly 100+ concurrent SM/ZF groups running 3-4 weeks ago.
---
thanks
---
6d 17h lvl 49 Mage
---
This
---
So is retail with the 'story'. Always been that way.
---
Horde starts genocide with no repercussions. Alliance just sit there and do nothing.
---
It's a good way to get your guild to start raiding, when you do not quite have a full roster, and start building a name/reputation for your guild on the server.
---
As a smaller guild, trying to step into raiding, you could say "we have 28 people today, can't do MC until we have exactly 40 ready, everyone just pug it whenever you want" or instead, you could show some initiative and advertise the run as being hosted and led by your guild, fill those last 12 slots and get your guild accustomed to running MC as a group. 
---
If you do not start raiding asap you run the very real risk of have your best members poached by other, more progressed raiding guilds. This can be a vicious, never ending cycle for smaller raiding guilds without strong leadership.
---
It works great as a recruiting tool as well. Essentially a "trial run" for both parties - the guild and the pug raider - to see how good of a fit each is for the other.
---
Crits grant double rage versus non-crits (So a crit for 250 would generate roughly as much rage as a hit for 500)
---
Crits also proc flurry which grants 30% attack speed to your next three attacks.
---
As a result you want 30~35% crit chance to maximize flurry uptime and anything after that is just gravy for your rage generation.
---
Assuming it’s not required than no one in the group needs them. If you can’t clear content without them or if the group wants to go a little faster then it is a little selfish to put yourself above everyone else and say I want to save my 2g, other people can go ahead. But like you said no they are not 100% necessary. There’s even some cheapy ones that do a pretty decent job.
---
Considering that same pull and entire run of that said dungeon is soloable by a warlock I don’t see why you’d wanna be a mage :D
---
And in the time people like you and I have been boycotting pre-orders, they've gotten more desperate by offering more incentives, or stripping out pieces of the game to try and lull you into pre-ordering their garbage.
---
So keep not pre-ordering. They'll continue to get more desperate. It's a marathon, not a 100-meter dash. They ran the marathon to make micro transactions the norm, now we've gotta run the marathon to fight their greedy and destructive practices.
---
You have a way out. Have fun.
---
Likely coming from the more recent-to-wow players (MoP/Legion/BfA) over from retail that watch streamers gear up and min-max and think it's the right or only way to play the game, and try to do it without a guild full of like-minded individuals.
---
&gt; Why do you think some big business buy certain companies that have a resource
---
Wow, you just don't understand the concept of an opportunity cost at all do you?
---
can you link your tanking macros or where you got them? Thank you good sir.
---
It was like that in burning crusade as well and even some of wrath, I went all of BC as enh shaman and at ant given tier it was a surprise to be in more then 5 pieces of mail gear just because leather had way more attack power and crit stats.
---
Str is only half effective for hunters, best would still be agi imo
---
You ignored my argument of whats considered Weird and whats Popular. 
---
I assume its because you understand that I am right and your example was clearly not a good argument. 
---
&gt;Didn't know I needed to have a wife + kids + a house to suddenly be qualified for having a life. 
---
You don't, but do you consider playing video games for 12+ hours makes you qualified for having a "life"?  
---
&gt;I mentioned my situation as an example of being able to mitigate most if not all bad effects of long gaming sessions as well as have a job pay taxes etc...
---
Cool. Doesn't help your argument one bit. We are talking about someone who is not an average joe. He played 20 hrs a day for 2 weeks? And averages 10-13 hours a day. That's not at all average. That's a sickness.
---
&gt;Why do you find someone taking personal time to enjoy their hobby pathetic may I ask?
---
I can't believe I have to argue this. Someone taking time off to enjoy gaming? Sure, that's fine. 2 weeks off? I wish! You played 8 hours a day? Nice!
---
Someone who has 30 days played in a 2 month old game... and has admitted to playing 18-20 hrs a day for 2 weeks... that's abnormal and imo pathetic.
---
Alright man
---
And that's perfectly fine. If you want to waste time twiddling your dick waiting for a tank or do 100 runs for an item because you keep losing rolls to people who can't even equip it and try to find groups competing for loot you need, absolutely no one is stopping you.
---
a meme spec, unviable for raid, and who benefit more from a spellpower sword like mageblade.
---
if you're going to waste it just so someone can trut around with a legendary, might aswell allow everyone to strut around with a legendary.
---
It’s the new meta
---
They can block a mouthy healer if they want. Won't stop others from hearing me, and won't prevent them for begging at my feet later.
---
That is a joke too.
---
That's incorrect sir.
---
What you do is add 15 bucks on a new account
---
Delete your toon make new name on new account. Then restore it on your main account
---
no, your MH should be higher dps lol
---
LF Tank/Healer/Keyholder UBRS Truestrike reservered
---
&gt;when you have a guild of 40+ level 60's that want to help you succeed and will join you for runs
---
I really hope so. I hit 60 somewhat late and no decent guilds have melee spots open. I've been guild hopping a bit and can't seem to find one that can even take down Onyxia. So between shit raids and hours in LFG/group forming, I'm pretty burnt out. 
---
&gt;Not everyone has the time to spend doing casual runs with randos from LFG who all need the same exact item that is going to take 10+ runs on average to even see drop once.
---
Not everyone needs those items either. Pre-Bis is nice to have but it's clearly not mandatory. If people don't have time to play the game then maybe they shouldn't expect as much loot as the people that do imo. That's typically how mmos work. 
---
&gt;If players want more casual runs without reserves they are free to start their own groups 
---
The problem is this mindset of reserving things affects everyone, even if you don't join their groups. The majority of whispers you get forming normal groups are people refusing to join unless you reserve x just for them. You absolutely can get a regular group going but it takes so much longer now as a result of this trend. Somewhere in here said it best, it's fine as an exception but it's quickly become the rule and that's problematic for everyone.
---
Most groups won’t care if you need BoE blue and they give it to you if it’s low value. The wrists probably sell 5g at most on AH if that. Now if Shadowfang drops out of SFK I would need on that no matter the class. Shadowfang worth like 500-1kg depending on server and economy. Best in slot twink item for warriors and rogues.
---
What about fiery or life stealing? Those are considerably cheaper and I’m fine upgrading every 8-10 levels. Thank you for your detailed reply.
---
This is just a brag disguised as a question
---
There is no doubt they are the best. The recent dueling tournament had several rules to nerf warlocks specifically (no use of hearthstones).
---
Opportunity cost is a thing, and you are completely failing to account for it.
---
LF raiding guild for classic classic. I never raided vanilla, but I did through BWL on classic. I also cleared all content in TBC, and up through BT in classic TBC. I skipped Classic WOTLK because I was meh about WOTLK, but I did raid through Icecrown. That's in WOTLK, not classic WOTLK, just want to be clear. I killed Deathwing too, but I don't remember if that was Cata, Cata Classic, or Cata pserver. Oh I also raided all expansions through WOTLK on a pserver before classic. Well one was after Classic TBC when I was jonesing for some classic classic. I'm so glad it's back!
---
Anyway. Hit me up!
---
Popular Opinion: Your "Unpopular Opinion" is almost never an unpopular opinion.
---
Ironforge and Orgrimmar used to have the only AHs outside of neutral AHs.  When they finally added AHs to UC and TB, they were individual AHs, not linked to each other or the Org AH.
---
That's why people hang out in Org and IF : it's a holdover from when that was the only place anyone used the AH.
---
How much on average?
---
Missing 'LF mage DPS' / 'LF holy priest'
---
Feels like Classic has reduced the PvE game to 3 classes, mage/warrior/priest
---
Reminds me of that awkward moment when some types “.gquit” into guild chat.
---
If you are too lacking in logic and reason to ignore all the warning signs then you deserve when happens to you, do you blame the construction company when someone wonders into and active build site with no safety gear on passed all the posted warning about making sure you are properly equipped, don't forget safety goggles, hard hats save heads, or orange reflective vests are always in season here, the person willfully ignores all of that and get injured, is it the fault of the construction company, NO they put themselves at risk and the paid for doing so. On a fundamental level you are responsible for your actions, you can't just blame everyone else.
---
i pick locks
---
They aren't. Dual wielding with the heroic strike method to never miss off hand swings competes with a druid spamming MCP. Our raid tanks don't even have good weps yet. Druid tanks are even less viable in classic than they were in vanilla due to the changes to combat.
---
Ah.  I just tell them I'm the tank so fuck em.
---
Nothing wrong with it but I don't want it in my groups.  It makes it less of a game and more of a loot grind.   Have fun with it, man.
---
Stack strength, agility, crit %, and stamina? Basically gear yourself like a rogue or kitty druid. 
---
I know you said that you understand it sucks, but I feel obligated to mention that this is probably the worst DPS you could possibly imagine in a PvE setting. Like, you'll be jealous of boomkin DPS bad.
---
How did you get that dragon on your character portrait?
---
I love rogues in my groups, but I only tank :P
---
I’d already planned on blocking, trolling abs ruining their run for being such exquisitely greedy pricks anyways. So no loss.
---
At the end of the day some people reserve and some don't but id prefer to not have my time wasted so id rather know before I enter the dungeon rather than what I have had happen where its not until were about to hit a certain boss that its suddenly master loot and ultimately the item drops and they take it before you even had  a chance so you end up wasting your own time.
---
No. your just extremely salty your locked into a garbage 9-5 you hate. so you bash people with free time.
---
I have people whispering me on occasion asking me to tank... And Im fury spec. So yeah, i dont get their comment either.
---
Ah then everything must feel like a eternity now days old fart.
---
If you want the best, it's always crusader. Other than that you can go for flat +DMG or fiery (pretty useless in MC).
---
I don't know about the second one, but is Spy the first one? Or is that only pvp enemy stuff?
---
Nice.  I just got mine for 6g on herod.
---
Dude, I agree with you...I agree that the key ring should already be in the game, I agree that spell batching is dog shit. Breath for a second.
---
That doesn't mean Blizz will change shit just because you're complaining about it on the internet. THAT is why you don't have to "prove common sense" to me. Because I'm not the one who decides what is/isn't in classic WoW. Why would convincing ME of a change also convince BLIZZARD? See where you're wrong here. It's sad that I have to say this stuff bc I agree with your message, but your means-by-which you're going about this is all wrong. Don't complain to me because you're mad at Blizz.
---
Also, you posted your comment twice. One of them was missing half of your paragraph.
---
If you're gunna bitch about people reading your comment, then make the comments consistent.
---
Nope, still agi as agi is 1=2 AP, not just RAP.
---
&gt; but I would pay around 50s
---
Haha, wow you cheapskate
---
There's a reason we have fear ward.
---
I never mess with anyone doing an escort. I might bend that rule if they've earned their way onto my KOS list.
---
It’s quite simple really. You don’t understand supply and demand. If you can’t find a tank that means 
---
1) all the tanks are occupied (running dungeons they need more, preparing for raid, farming arcane crystals)
---
2) the dungeon or wing of a dungeon that you want to run does not have good tank loot
---
They are not bad people for not giving up their valuable in game time to help you for no perceivable benefit. That actually makes you the bad person since you are actively demeaning people and have an inflated sense of importance. I’m starting to understand why you can’t find groups.
---
and a lot of grief, being labeled as a ninja for needing on a caster weapon, or at least, a retard.
---
which would result in you getting promptly removed from the group and quickly replaced since DPS are a dime a dozen
---
Why is this OK? When you can fucking print screen literally from the same fucking computer that you sit on, evidently with an internet connection as well because you play wold of fucking Warcraft? Stop saying OK to garbage like this, it fucking sucks!
---
Not a warlock addon, but Opie can be configured to do that, it creates radial button menus that you keybind to open, so example you could hit alt+p and have your pet selection there.
---
Yep. My goto response whenever people get pissy is:
---
&gt; Ok fine, sit in LFG for another 2 hours. Let me know if you change your mind and if I'm not in another group I'll tank for you.
---
Supply and demand folks. You're free to reserve anything you want. Just understand you're turning people off from joining.
---
I don't play Priest, but I will say the priest DM book will most likely drop in price. People are continuing to run DM, and it's a one-time use item, so the supply will eventually out pace the demand. I sold it for 100g on Sunday, and I expect it to continue going down in the next 2-3 weeks. And obviously as you said, you can always farm the book yourself.
---
I also wouldn't worry about the epic mount. Obviously, some people want it now (and I do too), but I feel like it's one of your last BIG purchases, and after that you just continue to accrue money. I'm looking at my epic mount as the icing on the cake, and focusing on maximizing professions, buying any/all recipes I can use, buying any epics that are multi-phase BiS (paid 225g for Myrmidon's Signet last night, was worth), etc. before finally finishing up with my epic mount. It's not NEEDED for anything, and it's not as large of a boost in speed as your first mount was. 
---
Finally, with regards to enchantments, as a healer I don't think you really need anything. Even as a tank I don't have many enchantments because you'll be replacing gear in the near future and no current content requires it. If you do get enchantments, fire resistance is the best in my opinion.
---
You won't always have a mage or warlock in the group.  You won't always be in a group.  Even if you have a mage and/or warlock, why wouldn't you want to contribute the most that you can in that given situation?
---
Just because you can't top the meter if a mage is in the group is a bad reason to NOT have something.
---
Also, a  lot of classes heal as a means to get loot for other specs, while also running dungeons for healing loot. Any players doing this will have to spend more time in dungeons to gear up than others running dungeons for loot used for a single purpose.
---
You're often marking / scouting the next pull and figuring out kill order etc.
---
You can bind them how you want in key bindings, and if you're wondering about zoom in/out you can bind it to shift + scroll just by pressing shift and scroll up/down in key binding screen.
---
They're an item for a quest in Westfall, so I'd consider it a quest item.
---
Also you missed the point, but ok.
---
So don't play the dungeon 10 times, go do something else
---
Oh god no it was like 90% a pug we only had a couple guildies. The tanks were all from different guilds so I figured open roll made the most sense. In a run with guild tanks that'd go straight to our MT.
---
Exactly why I rolled on a PVE server this time.
---
I played a PVP server in vanilla and would never again.
---
WoW open world PVP is stupid and pointless at best.
---
At worst its just getting ganked by huge groups / outlevelled corpse camping endlessly, morons with nothing better to do.
---
There's not even any risk involved. You don't lose anything except time being ganked. 
---
And there's no reward either since honor gains in open world are miniscule in comparison to organised BGs.
---
And if you are on a server with bad ratios it's just total frustration.
---
That's because there are tons of healers and they have no bargaining power. The amount of people willing to tank is tiny and groups constantly go 10-20 minutes at 4/5 waiting for a tank.
---
&gt; Other healers don't rly roll on priest gear.
---
This has not been my experience at all.
---
Frankly its not always about pre-bis, either.  Youre sharing with everyone while leveling, and while getting rid of your greens at 60 (the pieces that arent bis for anyone, but better than what you have).  It just makes the whole thing take longer.
---
I'm confused by your confusion. I'm agreeing with you and offering a possible explanation.
---
what's wrong with charger on reserve? that shit is so rare that in 99.999% of your runs it's basically nothing on reserve
---
This whole thread is representative of some issues people have with relationships, particularly with women.
---
There's a lot to unpack here. But I vote we throw the whole suitcase away.
---
You could farm the furbolgs in winterspring if you have professions that need it, or farm undead at any of the farms in wpl for Argent dawn rep. You can farm waterlords rep in silithus for if you ever plan on doing MC
---
Ok, then dont. Noone is forcing anyone to do anything
---
I literally had never reserved a single item on any run of my life, until last night.
---
I'm a tank, and trying to finish my UBRS key.  Only needed 2 of the gems.  I find a group that's doing "first 3 boss" spam runs, and figure it'd be a good opportunity to knock it out.  We do 4 runs, and the gem from Omokk drops every single time.  And I lose, every single time (I did manage to get the gem from Voone though).
---
So now I'm just one gem shy.  There is *no* loot for me anymore in LBRS.  Literally no reason for me to go, except that gem.  I see a group growing more and more desperate for a tank in LFG chat, so I figure I'll join them if I can have the gem reserved.  They agree, and of course it didn't drop, but that's beside the point  --  I was kinda doing them a favor by tanking an entire dungeon I had no reason to run, I don't think it was too terribly much to ask to reserve that gem.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dljaw3/slashfour_a_thoughtful_lfg_addon_that_doesnt/
---
&gt; I never mess with anyone doing an escort.
---
Escort quests are brutal... I'm liable to help sometimes too just because I know how much of a pain in the arse they are.
---
Or people with real life obligations :)
---
Wow is literally just a timesink. You can be playing peggle on a flight path or downing rag and it still means fuck all.
---
Wasnt that the case in BGs in Wrath as well?  Or am i thinking RBGs in Cata?
---
Haha yeah thanks
---
I do this but you have to say "I'll come if there's no one else that needs X"
---
If you ask if you can reserve it you sound like an asshole, but if there's no one else in the party that needs it anyway then who gives a shit.
---
On classic game design they never yeah. Everything was announced as we got today day 1
---
Only enemy PvP. It’s got KoS lists but not, afaik, a way to keep notes on your own faction.
---
Thx dude that was it!
---
Hahahahaha Awww I miss having a gf who plays wow 🙁
---
ITT: complaining about people complaining about stuff they don't like.
---
If they come out with TBC they are pretty much announcing that the game will eventually die again.
---
There was a time.  It was in BC or WotLK.
---
It really doesn’t matter. If I waste the time of a few pricks then waste another 20m more of theirs finding and waiting for the other DPS, it’s all worth it.
---
If a warrior shows up to tank wearing leather he should be immediately kicked.
---
&gt;and play for fun
---
I'm just going to throw this out there. I played on an RP server in vanilla, and with RP tends to come a bit more.. creativity with builds. So we had a melee hunter. Now let me tell you, as a healer at the time, I would have preferred to just 4man places instead of take him anywhere. I'd rather have literally any other class/spec, it's just an extra person doing next to nothing who also needs healing. If you want to have fun by all means, but make sure you're minimizing the impact to other peoples' fun because you want to memespec.
---
That is what it was and still is...
---
Grats! Our MT got the compendium from the first boss kill in DM the hour it dropped last week. He had Quel'Serrar that night after our Ony kill, then took it into MC for a full clear to break it in. He was a very happy warrior.
---
Roll hunter, use your pet
---
&gt; ...farmed up all my pre-BiS and Forors...
---
Question from one tank to another  --  how does one farm Foror's?  Is there a best strategy to fish for it, or is it just dumb luck from tons of DM runs, or should I start saving gold to AH one?
---
Wow, an actual dps that thinks they are doing tanks favors for dpsing their run.
---
I don't even really want to tank strat live with ALL orbs res, I'd leave immediately if you started typing out stuff like this.
---
You either be grateful you have a tank now or have fun waiting. I'll probably be halfway through before your group is even formed, if it ever fills 😂
---
Keep questing and focus on leveling. Quest rewards give more and more gold/valuable items as you continue to level and you will afford it no problem by 42-45.
---
Slowing down leveling to farm gold will be slower in the long run to both getting a mount and getting to 60.
---
I don’t disagree with you except that I’m not wrong, a warrior needing and claiming dibs on a piece of leather and refusing rogues because they want that piece is bullshit minmax behavior all because it adds 0.01% to their DPS over the plate equivalent, so in this situation, it is the minmax crowd that is being toxic.
---
Whitemane! Horde side. I’m an orc warrior tank and a mage as well.
---
I'm stood up straight, now go on, crawl back into that box you've escaped out of.
---
Head reserve seems to be mostly guild groups that are filling the remaining spots in my experience. Still plenty of people who want the chance for the T2 helms and amazing weapons.
---
Well, tbc at least. I stopped playing mid tbc but my understanding is that wrath introduced a lot of the features that classic players are trying to get away from.
---
Yes but it only covers a tiny pixel in the button which is difficult to see.  Proper red range in addons covers the whole button which is massively better.
---
What’s weird is that quite a few leather pieces have +str +sta
---
Congrats /clap! What’s that Addon for the quest font + chat font if you don’t mind?
---
40 man raids, 2-3 tanks max, do the math on the odds of a warrior being forced into a dps role.
---
I'm 59, I think I'll be okay in that regard.
---
i did that for a couple strat ud runs because i was almost at revered and didn't need any gear. everyone was fine with it.
---
Tried to hover over the ability to read it...
---
haha thats nuts
---
muh xp/hr
---
I wish. TBC is hands down the best version of WoW to date, maybe tied with wotlk.
---
I always knew Classic was going to get rather stale within a month, and I'm only in it for the friends that are playing. It has very serious gameplay and balance flaws that TBC solves.
---
Depends on the number of enemies.

That's just called ninja looting lol
---
because i think nightelf females look better than the other priests. i dont care about the racials
---
I 100% agree with the OP on this. You're never obligated to join that persons group. And its very simple (if you want to be petty) to literally go into general with "LFM [Same Dungeon as that guy who wants stuff] - Nothing on reserve" You'll probably get a group going in short order just from people thinking they're "Sticking it to" that guy.
---
I'm also waiting for people to realize that the only reason why you see a lot of the "LFM - Blahblahblah on res" groups in public channels is because they take a really long time for them to fill.
---
How the hell did they conclude that Boomerr wasn’t in on this? He fuckin told the guy to shout him out of stealth, that shows clear premeditation and an attempt to maintain appearances.
---
Both players should be permanently banned from CDL. What a joke.
---
As a frost mage you could wear no rings at all and beat a rogue 99 times out of 100.
---
I'm on Venoxis-DE and whenever I try to log in past 8pm, I'm greeted by a ~800 people, 20 minute que. We're still layered, too.
---
Actually, I think it's 1:1 for both Agility and Str. So maybe it doesn't even matter all that much. But you get other stuff with agility too.
---
Longuest grind of your life? Have u tried to lvl a warrior?!
---
That is incredibly false.
---
I'd say go for Agi over all, as a melee hunter, get Nightfall axe. Propose yourself as the dedicated nightfall windclip bot and stack agi for a crit every now and again.
---
Probably the best way you'll get into raiding as a melee hunter.
---
Be warned, wow can burn you out just the same as work did.
---
Actually just saw this in real time today. My boss just got a drone and we went to a nearby park to try it out and he showed us that auto follow feature.
---
Agree to a specific deal in chat and if op didn't follow the other guy files a ticket, gm checks logs, gold returned to other guy and item removed from OP.
---
Yasha?
---
You can't even fizzle a spell cast?? You have a compass and map instead of sense heading skill? No swimming skill?! You don't respawn naked after dieing?!? Casual!
---
Wrath was the most popular version of wow.
---
Same.
---
It’s only on Reddit we are a minority. Most people I interact with in game shares the idea of need before greed. Especially on leveling gear only worth a couple of gold on ah.
---
If you are using an add-on that shifts the UI around, such as Titanpanel, then moving your frames will not save properly. You need to disable that add-on, move your frames, and then re-enable it.
---
Or just make a PUG with the terms laid out before hand? If you don’t like it, don’t join it.
---
Seriously there thread are getting old.
---
I feel like bandages are a thing...
---
There is a special place in Hell for you. Guaranteed you're a Night Elf.
---
I totally disagree that it's selfish to reserve items. It is your choice to join the group or not. It is funny when half of the drops are reserved and they want a tank and healer though. Good luck with that.
---
Crusader is 100str for 15 seconds and is far better than anything else you can get as swords.
---
&gt;I want to enchant it ASAP because it’s best until raids
---
It's not. If you have the gold just laying around go for it, but man that's a lot of gold for something that you're not really at the gear point to worry about minmaxing just yet.
---
Know what, I apologize, I misunderstood your comment. The comments replying to you are the kind of mouthbreathers who always run around saying that everyone has to greed on epic BoEs and pretending that was always how it was, but it looks like you're on the right side of reality.
---
The as you find dps you change it to LFM Tank/Healer... Might as well look for everything at once.
---
Oh nice
---
So I just hit 40s in my Lock and I got Dark Pact.. is it worth it? I find myself smashing the spell 100x just to cast a spell I need. Then I looked up the higher ranks and it caps at 250 mana.. is that even nearly worth it end game? Feels very underwhelming..
---
Verigans until level 34 when you get bonebiter, unless you want to go to get corpsemaker
---
That’s amazing. He’s about to test it out tonight in MC! I’m sure he’s gonna love it as well!
---
40’s has been a slaughter fest for me on my server alliance is KOS in STV  and Hinderlands with large parties of 60 horde griefing which kills a good amount of the fun but I do agree when I’m not running back to my body after being 2 shot the zones are enjoyable
---
Oh, yeah yeah -- we're definitely on the same page there =)
---
To blizz?
---
Get the [Rock Pulverizer](https://classicdb.ch/?item=4983) from the [Murdaloc](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=739) quest in Badlands at lvl 30.  It's a lvl 40 quest, so get a friend to help.
---
It also makes fish bite faster if you are fishing
---
I mean it’s still the atmosphere that “all I care about is stuff for my character” it’s just a mindset I don’t care to group with.
---
It's like people wanting buffs.  Same type of deal.  If you don't want to have to help your group, play a hunter!
---
Ah I heard it was, but yeah I don’t got gold to be enchanting a sword with the best enchant if it’s not BiS til 60 eapecially. I’ll probably go with fiery or lifesteal since I need some sustain
---
Denke die Person meint, dass man keine Questmobs abkriegt. Bin selbst auf Venoxis, Essence of Water farmen ist die Hölle, nach 8 Uhr Abends haben wir eig. auch immer ques. Alles andere als tot.
---
They don't get heals. If they can't bother to make an effort (eat, bandage, etc.), then they can nerf their own DPS by having to drain life for half the next pack.
---
I get irritated on my warlock when I'm bandaging and get a fat heal. I just wasted a bandage, and they wasted their mana!
---
No, you missed the point.
---
A quest item only drops if you have the quest.  A trade material can drop at any time.  You can gather the livers if you don't have the quest.  You can buy the livers on the AH.  There are ways to get the item other than when you have the quest.  You can be 100% done with the quest before you even pick it up.
---
You're comparing two different kinds of items when you compare quest items to trade materials that are used in a quest.  
---
Heck, even comparing two quest items isn't going to be a good comparison.  Compare something like the spider legs you need for the Warrior armor quest (which have about 150% drop rate) or the bug eye quest (even higher), to something like Sida's bag, and it's a huge difference.
---
The livers have always been a low drop rate.  You're comparing apples to oranges here.
---
I had the MT in one of the attempts say "gogo pop cds" we were 1/3 alive and she was at like 15%
---
I kept saying to myself "don't do it, you'll pull aggro"
---
My threat meter is installed, but it doesnt seem to work with how finnicky onyxia is in phase 3.
---
He literally says it 3 times over a minute. The 4th time he says it again and I go fuck it, I pop reckless, and start executing.
---
Even though I had barely auto attacked up till then, I pulled aggro on the 4th and she breathed on the raid.
---
I used to think the same thing but I looked into it and got told.
---
T3 was used in some cases until Black Temple, but it lasted at least until Vashj and Kael.
---
You definitely wouldn't replace Naxx loot before heroic dungeon epics.
---
You should try to join the FBI as a profiler.
---
I mean... you're terrible at it, but your effort is redeemable! I want to try though!
---
Maybe you feel the need to defend OP because you also spend/wish you could dedicate that disgusting amount of time to a video game which is 2 months old. And seeing other people point out how this is clearly not normal threatens your sense normalcy of this sort of behavior? You are most likely over weight, and spending time in WoW helps you escape your mundane day to day because you have no real friends or girlfriend/boyfriend, no real career path, and a family who has given up on telling you to grow up, so they allow you to live at home still, hoping one day you acquire some kind of motivation for life outside of videogames. 
---
Nah... you're just dumb. Lmao.
---
It can be. I  paid a guy 10g to not roll on princess ring. Normally people sell carries for that ring for 30g, so it was a decent savings.
---
It's a good alternative to reserving loot, and usually you pay less.
---
Would it become efficient if you grabbed the Mana Drain talent that deals damage based on amount drained? You know, that talent nobody ever picks.
---
With that being said I remember raiding for months without upgrading thrash blade due to competition for gear. It's not a terrible idea.
---
Hey all  look flat out I'm new to the game. I'm level 19 warrior and it's been fun leveling but questing solo has bren such a god damn chore. 
---
I wanna try and do dungeons but I was mostly a 2 handed dps when I was using a guide. It seems like all the groups I run I to need a tank.
---
I'm not strong at tanking and I'm still somewhat fresh to it. Does anyone mind maybe giving me some advice on what to do? I can handle my own solo but I cant even tell how my dps is.
---
Hmmm you might have a point there.
---
It's mostly running back and forth, so not really worth without already having an epic mount.
---
Withou minmaxing crowd you would have nothing to do in the game. If you don't minmax then why even run dungeons more than once if you can clear MC in anything that is blue quality.
---
&gt;You're not doing me a favor by tanking the run, I'm doing you a favor for coming along to dps, why the fuck should you get special treatment? 
---
Well thats just not true. DPS are instantly replaceable while it can take upwards of 10 min to yourself a willing tank.
---
Chipotle is fantastic. The “shit” I said was meant literally, as the OP said they had their head IN the toilet. Wasn’t insinuating that Chipotle is shit. I’ve actually been super sad for the past year since we moved somewhere that actually doesn’t have it.
---
We're gonna have to wait and see - it's no secret that Classic was insanely popular largely thanks to the state of retail, if retail manages to recover in a good way and we get some exciting news with BlizzCon, who knows.
---
Whitemane, fallen.  I too am in that guild xD.  See you tonight for raid
---
In case it flies over anyone's head, the rings from the tribute chest are NOT unique. You can equip 2 +15-agi and 1% hit rings at once. Even when doing normal tribute runs, we had a warrior leveling from 58 onwards get 2 of the 14str/15stam rings along the way. Not hit rings, but still pretty decent for him.
---
not really no. but it also felt the most atmospheric/RP like, probably just ahead of IF

Classic does t need exposure. So that's not an argument
---
Do you have a good source for stat prios for rogue? It's nice to know that bit about crit over hit after yellow hit cap is reached but I'll admit I don't really know how rogue itemization works. Like obviously agi is better than str but is 1 agi better than 2 str or 3 ap?
---
Calling this streamer drama is like calling cheating in an NFL football game "TV Drama".
---
It says wow classic, not what Skulldaisygimp wants.  Take your bullshit and fuck off.  Anyone can talk about anything related to classic they want.  Get off your high horse dbag
---
I cant wait for warriors to say vael is the only true DPS test to see what class does the most dmg like they did in vanilla.
---
Or you could just say it was sometimes Deadmines = DM and sometimes Deadmines = VC, instead of saying it was ALWAYS one way and the thousands of people who remember otherwise are hallucinating.
---
Pull back a bit for a couple days and it will release it’s deathly clutches.
---
Then start adding gym into your life.
---
You sound like the bitch that we see In the picture.
---
That's not really accurate. Most people wanted classic because they knew, eventually, TBC and Wrath would come. I love Classic but am waiting patiently to roll another BE DK.
---
Funnily enough I killed a Warrior with Blade Flurry last week.
---
Server: Skeram
---
Name: Celloria
---
Just bought a guild charter and I'm gonna start collecting sigs.
---
At level 44 you are fairly low for ZF. Level 45 is what I would typically recommend as the min level for tanking. Whirlwind axe should be okay to tank ZF. Though Ravager or a 2h from Uldaman would probably be better. You will want to keep a 1h+shield with you. Some of the bosses and groups you will be fighting hit pretty hard. At level 48 you will be good to tank Maraudon.
---
No, most likely used an engineering item or potion.
---
What? How is this relevant? It's not a matter of how many people could tank, it's a matter of how many people do so.
---
If you can't afford it dont bother enchanting it tbh. Worry about farming gold and devote your time to farming tbh. If anything get like +3 damage as it's relatively cheap.
---
Why don't they like the Census+ addon? Worried people would make faction imbalances worse if everyone knew some of the servers were already 35/65? I don't get why else they'd do it
---
im a psychologist too as you can see
---
Thrash blade is siiick. A great weapon you'll use for quite awhile. Worth throwing an enchant on. I probably used it until about lvl 53.
---
Yeah i dont know what he is talking about
---
This right here is absolute gold. Well done.
---
This is pasta-worthy.
---
Btw I'm not a warrior, I'm a druid :)
---
I guess I'm still not seeing my mistake.
---
Tauren. I serve the warcheif.  We both still may be druids, but that doesn’t mean I don’t fight for my faction.

---
Just be clear about what's happening up front and its all good.
---
Keyring is coming in the first patch. That's not the same thing as phase 2. Phase 2 can technically arrive with no clientside patch just like Dire Maul did.
---
Naa, BC had waaay more dps plate gear. Hell the sets themselves offered both tanking and dps variants.
---
"Next drop?" How common do you think these things are? I hate to break it to you, but bindings have a **3% drop rate.**
---
You could spend the next year raiding every week and you won't see another one.
---
You're insane.
---
Right I think the thing here for the most part is people making fun of people with unreasonable reservations, not that they think they shouldn't be allowed to do it.
---
What in the world did you do to your raid frames.
---
Not the original op. I create Jed ids whenever I am in the area and have instance cap up. I don’t reserve reed. I fill a group in about 5 min. Lost the roll on reed 13 times now. That’s fine. I play the game because I like playing with people. I have an elaborate ignore list but having done this for a while now people know who I am and I get quick competent people who appricate a no reserve atmosphere. 
---
I have tanked on other characters same thing I don’t reserve loot. Not even orbs. Wow is a multiplier game. Multiplayer means not always having to progress your character at the cost of all else. There is always another run. 
---
Raids is a different story. I would never try and organize that and if you want to reserve there np. Organizing 40 people is insane and I think that qualifies for something in the loot. 
---
But 5 mans/ubrs? I don’t find it hard as either a tank or dps. As long as you are liberal with your blacklist. Most reserve lists I have run with have had worse players, tanks who don’t wait on mana, healers who try to be the most mana efficent as possible and let people die because they are casting a rank 1 spell etc. 
---
But maybe wow has changed and the playerbase with it and I am stuck in the past. Just because you can reserve something and get groups doesn’t mean you should. 
---
I will eventually get my reed without reserving it. I will eventually complete my ubrs key without reserving gems. What’s the rush? We don’t even have a date for phase 2. There is always another dungeon to run.
---
The bonebiter is actually the supreme one in terms of single target damage/questing.

Omg!!!!! The memories!!!!

Good job mate

It does not work exactly like that because you would assume 0% chance to hit with spells when player target is 16 levels higher? But its absolutely possible to land spell on even 30 level higher players (have tested, after lots of tries random spells land, resist is still high).
---
So either there is some cap, like 1% chance to land spell no matter what, or something else going on.
---
I actually said I’m okay with paying them (reading is hard, I know). But allowing them “all orbs and greens/blues” can potentially grant them income that matches or even far exceeds that of any dps.
---
I’m a healer, I’m well aware of a role that is thankless that has the stresses increased by a monkey (which includes the tank). Unfortunately my income avenues cannot reach the potential of a tank charging for services or a dps, without a lot of luck. Lasher farming is inconsistent and barely edges out efficient Mara farming.
---
So, yeah. I’m fine with compensation. But free reign?Nooooope. A tanking is ***that*** hard.
---
That's even worse. That way you are excluding people of your class who want to do the dungeon for quest or something.
---
More than warriors, it’s basically all classes except clothies.
---
Yes, and OP hasn't specified his spec or gear so my point was it's rather brazen to come to a "since your bad" conclusion.
---
its still really helpful if your taunts aren't resisted once you wake up. Eranikus will tear through your squishy players really fast. I would say 51 is fine if you have someone in the group that can slap on a shield and OT
---
Yeah, I spend anywhere from 2-5g per dungeon run on gear repairs, but I'm expected to come run a dungeon that has no purpose for me. 
---
There's a reason I've been leveling an alt and only running Dire Maul / UBRS on my main (the two dungeons I still need anything from). If tanks don't have a reason to tank, then we're just not gonna do it. When I run with my DPS friends, I can literally hear them watching Netflix, Youtube, or a pointless football game (seriously, who even cares about the Giants?). Yet when I'm the one tanking, I have to constantly explain to everyone where to go, watch to make sure they don't pull, mark before every pull, monitor everyone's position, and clean up after their mistakes. All while trying to maintain threat because somehow my DPS have macro'd their opener to start as soon as I Charge in. 
---
I enjoy tanking, don't get me wrong, because it's far more rewarding than playing a brain dead DPS class (which is what I've done in past games), but we definitely have pretty serious downsides for being tanks, and certain people (mages) just don't seem to understand/accept that.
---
You can tank most of ZF 2h and just make a macro to switch to sword and shield for bosses. ZF you can do till about 46-47 and Mara is at 48. I suggest questing a bit of that xp. And i dont think whirlwind is quite good enough, look to invest in a new wep.
---
&gt; Listen here you trash pug. You are garbage. I don't care if you're a tank, you are a shitter pug. You think I owe you something because you rolled a warrior? I'm better then you. My guild is better then you. I'm more skilled then you, my gear is better, I have more experience, my parses are better, my rep as a player is better, and I don't need this instance either. If I come along to dps a dungeon is because I'm bored and I'll take the 20g from vendor drops. You think you're entitled to anything? You utter no name, you have no idea what entitlement even is. If I want to do an instance for an actual reason, I will find skilled people so I don't waste my time. I will only run with you if there are no stakes on the line and I have time to kill. The balls on this trash pile tank thinking that he matters. Lol @ you.
---
&gt; I've always wanted to say that to one of you awful entitled tanks. Normally I just ignore you guys like the human trash you are. You just swirl around in the toilet that is lfg chat with your insignificant reserve runs with other green geared shitters...but today you know what I actually think of you. You are as worthless as the pile of shit I walk by on the sidewalk. That felt really good.
---
Dude.
---
It was just an example.
---
Christ, take a chill pill.
---
That's just Youtube. Theres a reason 90% of the WoW videos are guides or reaction videos. The search algorithm has massively declined in quality over the last year or so in their efforts to censor/promote various forms of content.
---
Last time I played Ally I would go to Darn to make mooncloth, and that’s about it.
---
Did you do the goblin quests for the elementals and random items? There’s a trogg quest as well I remember. There definitely isn’t a ton though. I grinded there a good bit while waiting on elemental spawns or was high or something.
---
Not sure if it’s the same bug I remember from 2005. There were a few flight masters, Southshore for alliance specifically, that if you held down both mouth buttons as you got on it you could control it, for a minute or two then that portion of the server would crash and reset. I’ve tried to do it a couple times now as Horde but no success.
---
Also...video recording a screen.. 😬😬😬
---
I mean it happens. If people give you a hard time, forget them.
---
No kidding.
---
Wont be joining your group 😎
---
I suggest learning to tank. It's probably the most fun role in dungeons. It also allows you to always find groups, determine your group composition, set the pace of the dungeon, etc. Regardless of whether you're arms or fury, you'll be able to tank pretty much all the dungeons up to ST, and the arms spec is pretty great for leveling.
---
Just make sure you're 2 levels more than the minimum level requirement for a dungeon before you go in, and you'll have no problem holding aggro with the standard tank rotation. I won't go into specifics as there are guides written by better players, but I highly recommend learning the basics. It's not tough but it's very rewarding.
---
Its so recognizable and such a good hat that it says a little something about how decent your gear probably is. Its not a T2 helm, but it might ward off someone from ganking you
---
Pretty sure try hard druid flag carriers will rock 2. Of anything 1 and the armour ring but 2 on a carrier is insane.
---
Liking it so far.
---
However it seems to be forcing lfg channel into my general chat window?
---
Not sure if its intentional or what but I have a problem with this as it's extremely distracting.
---
I out DPS Fury Warrs with better gear than me every Raid. Fury Warrs are budget Rogues but take all the gear from Rogues.
---
We are obviously talking about money greens and blues and not every PoS that drops
---
It’s been need for BoEs for as long as I have been playing
---
Why would Boomer tell Tmugsy to shout him out of stealth?
---
You like that? You fucking retard.
---
Why? Because they might not have all the time in the world to play the game? 
---
Tanking a dungeon is vastly more work than DPSing, and forming your own group is vastly more difficult than just joining one that’s forming. 
---
Just because you feel entitled to run with a group doesn’t mean it’s someone else’s responsibility to offer that to you.
---
Oh not talking about tanks, bless you sir!
---
Drinking a lot of booze out of game also has the same effect
---
hmmmmm
---
Are you on Pagle?
---
No because no one said that
---
Looks like its off to ogrimaar to buy skills and maybe a shield and sword.
---
What’s the rush? Sounds like you want to play single player in an mmo
---
Is it possible to masterloot someone items from the DM Tribute chest? ... or does everything have to be looted manually?
---
Oh thought it was 2 day for some reason
---
Please never tank with Ravager. While you're spinning you can't dodge or parry. You take immense amounts of damage.
---
Getting baited into obvious trolling. For sure
---
That's true to an extent, but it's definitely dependent more on the rest of your group than you. ST is the exception where I'd say DPS need to be a higher level. Just as an example, I ran ST at 51 and 52 and had absolutely no problems. Went back at 55 to finish the egg quest, and we literally couldn't beat the boss until replacing one of our DPS. After three wipes we brought in an OT, which made it much easier, but tank levels really don't dictate the final boss in ST at all.
---
I was a prot war back in vanilla so my job was to get as much threat as possible. Now I’m a lock and struggling to adjust. Any tips on how to manage threat and not be that guy?
---
This is why you roll troll shadow priest and just destroy any rogue you come across. You have a ridiculously high chance of either reisting the stun or stunning the rogue during their own opener, both of which nearly guarantee death or at least running away for the rogue.
---
lol troll away.. I never said that I just refuted your claim that only 10% of the initial players still play.
---
It even fucked up your UI o.O
---
Thanks for more info
---
And most of them were inferior to leather offset items and badge gear...
---
I'm a horde priest on Blameaux and I posted about this yesterday. The healer market at least on our server is completely and totally saturated, especially priests. Lots of raid comps are still looking for sham/druid heals.
---
I would assume it's because SPriest is well known to be one of the best PvP specs. So to gear everyone is queueing as heals in preraid dungeons under the assumption that they will get groups faster while they gear for P2/P3.
---
If I was looking to do an instance for a reason, I would run with one of the many skilled and geared tanks from my guild. Even the feral druid alt of one of my guildies would be a better option than some shitter pug tank from world chat. You're not only replaceable, but you don't matter in the slightest to me. You might as well be an NPC. I don't need any of this blue gear, and when I did I ran with my guild. If I'm slumming it in lfg, it's because I'm bored and trying to kill some time for vendor junk so I can make 20g. If I join your run people are overly nice to me because of my guilds reputation and that I'm outperforming all other dps in this pug a mere 2 months after launch. I don't complain if the group is shit because I expected it to be shit, so wiping cause the tank ass pulled 3 packs at once is literally par for the course.
---
You think the entitlement of tanks even begins to compare to the entitlement of top players in top guilds? It doesn't. In game I'm helpful and respectful, but here, today know that I'm better than you in this game in every single way possible. These forums are full of the lowest common denominator, and you guys are shit at this game. If all of the pug tanks disappeared over night I would barely be effected. I don't join reserve runs because the very idea that you would think that anyone deserves anything over me for showing up is offensive. Trash needs to know it's place.
---
Eh I am not sure about this unless the spec in question is some PVP-oriented one. Your example is more suitable for warrior tanking 5 man to gear his dps raid role. I can't imagine resto shammy/druid or holy pal/priest gearing their offspecs since their offspecs are oh so bad in classic, unless, again, PVP.
---
Raids, if a guild is running it, I fully expect BOE's/mats/legendaries are reserved. You're basically filling in and getting anything would be a plus really.
---
If it's pure pug, it's a douchebag move.
---
And dungeons, unless you're hard carrying a single person, don't reserve things, just run with friends who will help you farm it.
---
What is this fascination with boxes? Did you steal a child’s toy after pillaging an innocent farm and just learn about shapes and/or furniture? Pigspawn savages.
---
So many people here have forgotten this mark.  They have dilussions of grandeur about how these things work.
---
On a PvP server n when I tried smashing that button for some decent mana i wasted too much time n died lol
---
Had a bad LBRS group recently (group of 4 in a guild and me as pug dps) - first half the dungeon went incredibly smooth. they were clearly a little drunk but everyone was joking in party chat and having fun. We kill the spider boss but the priest dies  (they accidentally pulled the boss with the first big pack of spiders). Priest runs all the way back as we carefully clear the next 2 packs of spiders and get to the ogres.
---
We bio while waiting for the priest, who ends up pulling one of the side spider groups and dying again before anyone was back to help him. We decide to clear the ogres while waiting cause they want to do the quest for the ogres boss event. Priest finally gets back and they immediately start the ogres event without any plan. Neither the priest nor the warrior tank use fear to cc, and my sheep keeps getting broken by one of the other dps. The priest ooms in 15 seconds, tank dies and the wipe chain starts.
---
I decide I'm not waiting for another 10 minutes (already midnight), slow fall to the bottom floor and hearth tf outta there. One of their dps whisper me saying it was rude to leave like that, and I respond that it was rude to waste other peoples' time like that
---
Gotta pick your battles, friends-
---
What is going to be in Classic +? Completely brand new content?
---
TBC is such a good expansion. Ret paladin stops being a meme, prot paladin becomes the defacto non-raid tank. Feral druids get huge buffs (mangle). Boomkin is playable even if not ideal as their mana issues a heavily but not completely alleviated. Every mage spec is viable at every raid tier (though some are slightly objectively better.) All warlock specs are viable at every raid tier. Shamans and druids aren't forced to be resto (aside from 1 feral druid tank.) Shadowpriests become more than a shadow-weave debuff raid slot, and become integral part of the raid with Vampiric Touch (also fairly competitive dps.) 
---
Gear starts dropping with proper stats itemization for each class. Mana regen is mostly fixed so certain class specs aren't rendered completely unplayable due to low regen. There's way more buffs, trinkets, and procs, so it's actually more skillful to maintain 95% top dps potential for your class.
---
There's so many issues with combat and gameplay in Classic, and TBC fixes so many of those issues.
---
I can't believe people who claim Classic is better unless they absolutely hate the idea of summoning stones actually summoning, the concept of flying mounts, or shattrath having portals to every Azeroth major city.
---
I get that you want your BIS items and whatnot. But I feel like things are getting out of hand with the reserved stuff. I mean it was sometimes around, but i feel like it has been exponentially growing by the day.  
---
The greed is also getting out of hand 'everything not needed is reserved for tank' What am I supposed to even give away my greys and whites?
---
Still no, as the talent only does 30% of mana drain as damage. Using drain life does more much damage and returns all of it as HP, which then can be lifetapped into mana. With the *improved drain life* and *improved life tap* talents, it is a much better source of mana than the drain mana spell.
---
Still beating that dead horse of a soundbyte for karma eh?  Oh well, I guess special needs kids need reddit karma too like the rest of us.  Keep on keeping on there slugger! \*pats your head affectionately\*
---
Flew into TM on accident like a moron instead of clicking UC. There was a 51 rogue and 59 Druid tanking. I spent about an hour killing them, and then any other higher level character trying to kill some low horde.
---
&gt;I'd say things have gotten easier in the last few years since Buddy was killed though. Every modern bot I've seen just isn't even remotely up to snuff compared to how that bot used to function.   
---
Wait what?  What is "buddy"?
---
&gt; I have to say people aren't being very social anyway while they are headed to the dungeon.
---
I respectfully disagree with this. I have at least half a dozen people on my friends list simply because we conversed before the group was fully formed / gathered.
---
Oh noes that’s how I solo’ed the Shadoweaver Head Piece pattern tailoring quest in Searing Gorge as a level 44 Warlock although the group consisted of 48 - 50 mobs. Just kited one of them until the rest of the group left.
---
Hmm interesting I’m really thinking lifesteal or fiery , if they are a lot cheaper then crusader but if still pretty expensive yeah. I’ll save the money and farm up
---
It’s the underlying attitude that it’s ok to reserve gear that’s the problem. You gear above all else, me me me, nothing else matters is a horrible mentality to have in an mmo
---
So each dungeon has a "level range" where it's appropriate to run the dungeon. If you are new to tanking, one thing I would recommend is waiting until your level is on the higher end of that range before doing it. You will have a much easier time overall. https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-dungeons-overview - check here for the appropriate level ranges for the dungeons.
---
Have you looked into getting any addons yet? A really useful one is Threat Plates Classic. It changes the health bar of enemies to a different color based on whether you have threat on them or not.
---
&gt; Zin'rokh, Destroyer of Worlds
---
I haven't checked yet, but if the model isn't flipped back around in classic, I'm going to be very sad. Somewhere along the way, WotlK I think, they flipped it the "correct" way with the pointy edge up [like this](https://images.app.goo.gl/i6SsUCQWojZv3Q6x5), while the OG blade looked [like this](https://images.app.goo.gl/bv3gSQW5WCPuSD3U9) and was clearly the superior way to hold that sword. 
---
Either way, I'm getting another one this time around. Love that thing.
---
How is it horde biased? Alliance are getting all the world firsts for a reason.
---
Where in my post does it seem like I need to take a chill pill?
---
I made a post, which you apparently didn't understand.  So I put more of an explanation so you could understand it.
---
I think hes saying right before the bot starts its rotation, tag the mob with an auto or something small. then it will switch to being your tag but if the mage lands the frostbolt they will take aggro but might be designed not to fight back since it isnt the bots tagged mob. not sure though
---
I didn't know any humans still played Diablo 2, lol
---
Twinks or people like OP who actually want to use it for some reason, I guess.
---
I've seen moonkins out dps rouges, what's your point? You can always find examples of rogues beating warriors. I'm simply saying that if you are in a enviroment where everyone is min maxing, warriors will always beat rogues in / past bwl because they simply get outscaled. As far as MC go, yes, rogues can be competitive.
---
Pretty sure it’s still low enough to make this experienced unbelievably unlikely.
---
Having the choice to join the group or not, doesn't mean the behavior isn't selfish. It's selfish.
---
I think some file is set on read only. Idk which it is, have to check when iam home.
---
God you guys are nuts. You're like the people in OSRS who dont understand that the most efficient grind is usually not the most fun.
---
I know its gonna blow your mind, but sometimes people actually play wow *because they enjoy it* and for no other reason. It doesnt have to feel like a fucking job
---
I've done so many damn tribute runs trying to get Treant's Bane that almost every rogue in my guild has 2 of those rings. Ive got 2, our main tank has 2, ... but where my axe at yo?
---
I tanked ST as 51 prot paladin, full clear. Last boss is always weird because of the sleep/banish and having a dps warrior helped there for off tanking.
---
You're not allowed to say LFG around here.
---
Nice I’ll try it out brother
---
Thats a good one. You can also check out https://legacy-wow.com/blacksmithing-1-300/
---
I used that 1-275 and it seemed great.  275-300 is where it gets really expensive (basically a stack of thorium per level) so unless you're in a massive hurry, I'd try offering my services to make Arcanite Rods.  They will give skills 275-280, which in the end saves you from farming 100 Thorium.  That's the only real addendum I'd have.
---
+1 for leap frog studios music
---
Just keep going.  Farm after you hit 40 if you are still behind as gold increases a lot from regular kills.
---
Will save you a lot of time.
---
😃
---
Bring a paladin to tank suppression room whelps, easy.
---
This is added in TBC. In classic it's 10% for Honoured and above.
---
Only discount in Classic is at honored
---
its a youtuber called "leap frog studios" he does rock/metal covers of songs
---
Why? you cast a spell and only need to endure those &gt;30 secs which you are compensated for.  Or is there something used which costs more, then please tell me.
---
Thank man. You too
---
Eliteplayerframe addon
---
Whatever the gf makes
---
nah, not in vanilla. The other discount is PVP rank 3 (which isn't out until phase 2), but I'm not even sure if that would apply to this vendor in particular.
---
Oh, sorry I misread your comment. I thought you said Firey and flurry axe can't proc. Thanks for clarifying
---
Jeez. What server is this? I play a high pop server but Org is never this packed.
---
Crusader is living lavish fiery is used for leveling
---
Yep!
---
The more complicated the loot system the more it looks like a scam.  Easier to understand the better.  Secondly - druids, shaman, paladins have lower population numbers yet are needed in these raids... especially pug raids and if you restrict loot you may lose interest in needed support classes.
---
Hi, /u/BigOlGulpOWater
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dlmwqd/asmongold_endorses_crossfaction_teaming/). 
---
You're both right, it's fine to do. Blizzard doesn't have enough insight into your operating system to be able to tell you're remoting into your own machine, but they can tell if the machine itself is running on a public-cloud provider's infrastructure. If it helps you feel better about it, I use Moonlight regularly to play WoW on my phone (alts or basic farming etc) and know tons of people that used Chrome Remote Desktop to login before leaving work. I can't find it now, but I'm pretty sure I read a blue post that stated it was specifically for public-cloud based VMs as they wouldn't be able to identify who is logging into that machine to then play wow from your account (since they have no access to the OS of the VM). I imagine this has implications on either identifying account security issues or on identifying exploiters.
---
But either way - even if the blue post is something I'm imagining, I've been playing WoW via moonlight since Classic launched and haven't ran into any issues. On a related note, I would suggest looking into setting up Moonlight if you have an Nvidia GPU on your home machine. It's free (open source) and utilizes Nvidia's Gamestream protocol that they released for public use after abandoning shield. This protocol apparently allows for a much smoother networking experience than SteamLink, particularly when accessing it from a different network entirely.
---
Seriously. More than half of my relationship is playful jabs at each other.
---
Both is fine. But idk why someone would be shitty for not using it unless your gear made it highly necessary.
---
Not an addon, I changed the font manually
---
Thanks brother man dude!
---
The thing is I'm not going around reserving items because I think I'm better then you. I'm just better then you. I don't spam in lfg because the only way I'd go slumming is if there are no stakes and I'm bored. It's like we play 2 different games, and I only lower myself to your level when I have nothing better to do.
---
Only 2/3 the size of ashkandi
---
Too bad it's a 25% BASE stamina buff, instead of TOTAL, like on private servers.
---
Frankly I would avoid spending the money since leveling gear tends to get replaced quickly. I was always a fan of an Iron Counterweight or Fiery (which is procs per minute) for the cost-effectiveness.
---
Technically it's an extra attack , as it's a skill that can be used with an instant cast, but when you say "extra attack" , people will assume auto attack, which isn't the case. So you just kinda worded it in a way that is easily misinterpreted from your original intention
---
How can someone be bad at warlock though? Their normal rotation is literally spamming one button. If they're lucky, they get to apply corruption, other dots are a no-no. And a curse ofc, though sometimes not every warlock is even assigned one.
---
Same with mage, you don't even get those options and spam one button until phase 5.
---
The only (meta) DPS class that takes some thought to play optimally is warrior and maybe hunter.
---
Heroin bad
---
Any fun and lucrative world drops I can farm? I know about crusader enchant. I play mostly solo and are bored to death with BRD pickpocket runs and solo plugger. I'm playing dagger rogue specced in ass/sub.
---
Yep
---
Buzzwords and my muh retail boogeyman. Okay.
---
Go west from the bank. It's on your right in one of the tree houses.
---
Because reserving an item is akin to this line of thinking. 
---
I need loot to make my character better. I need a group to get loot. But I want to play the game as little as possible to get the loot. I don’t want to risk losing an item to another person. So because the only thing that maters is my loot and my progression I’ll make sure that if it drops it’s mine. Never mind that someone else needs it too F them, they can make there own group. And because I am a tank/healer and CAN do it there is nothing wrong with it. 
---
This line of thinking says the only thing that maters is me. The only thing that maters is getting this gear so I never have to run this dungeon again. What’s so wrong about having to win a roll. If you lose oh well I can run it again and again.
---
I'm in the same boat as you. Just hit 60 this morning. 
---
I've farmed essences of waters and have been selling them for a while, but kept 10 for Hide of the Wild. Got lucky with some of the other mats (like the plagueland grubs) while questing, and just spent the extra ~150 to craft and get the remainder of mats. 
---
I think I will pass on Truefaith for now until I have the Mooncloth, see if the price drops a fair bit for the recipe and I get lucky.
---
Trinket I plan on running a few DM runs keeping my fingers crossed and check the price daily on the book. Was at 100 a few days ago and it's down to 70 on my server, so I don't mind waiting a little longer. 
---
So for me: I'm going to be farming for my epic mount over the next few weeks while keeping an eye out on price drops for the trinket. 
---
Take that info how you will :)
---
Good jokes.  Going to end funny or end badly, but if you have that sort of relationship it's hilarious. 
---
I do, but after knowing her for 10 years I can still fuck up a joke and end up in time out.
---
*tips fedora*
---
Okay what i do is after i kill tinker i run to the lower bridge above rotgrip and you can pull rotgrip with a curse of doom and siphon life if you can get it in time, then i run back to the ramp near where tinker is and stand at the top of the ramp and wait for Rotgrip to come usually takes about a minute or 2.. if he pulls with a hydra i will cast curse of doom on rotgrip and a fear on the hydra from the top of the ramp. I will continue running towards princess while doting up rotgrip on the way and can usually kill him without even taking a hit. After i kill rotgrip i loot him then continue to princess, at princess there is a rock you can stand on to evade the hydra and i stand on it until im out of combat so i dont even have to kill the hydra.
---
Even with killing all 3 bosses ive still managed to hit the 5 instances per hour cap lol
---
Hope this helps.
---
I do the same, reveal my holy form, swap gear, then I do the unthinkable and summon Benediction from Anathema while kissing her good bye for 30 minutes. I love the compliments I get, only once had someone get mad, and that was a 59 priest who wanted to dps instead of heal, I patted him on the head and told him to let the big dogs do the dirty work.
---
Seconded.
---
I love it!
---
Experienced this in BRD as a geared 60 tank last night... outside of the attacks I blocked ofc
---
I literally was killed feet from finishing the mechanical chicken escort in feralas the other day. Survived the three mob spawns and some lvl 60 gnome mage killed me so close to the dock. Absolutely infuriating
---
Not an addon, just changed the font
---
Teleport in, walk past the hydras and lizards, turn slightly left at the first giant and follow the rest of the path sticking to the right edge, jump past the waterfall to the left before Princess
---
Fantastic well reasoned argument. A+
---
If you do tell them when they join the group. As in have someone besides the leader spamming that when new people join. It's a pug though, so you might have issues getting people to join.  Normal pug expectations are everyone gets a chance to roll on upgrades.
---
I forgot about that. I totally used darn because of lag.
---
Pug raids are gdkp. No other way to do it
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=213ZPTiFEjU
---
There's this video which shows the run, including the goblin boss.
---
Should be able to see a rough outline.
---
What faction? You cant blizzard aoe farm till 23 and even then requires some decent int gear to get away with it. There are plenty of classic mage aoe grinding videos out there so you're best off just watching one of those and go from there. Any info here people will just be regurgitating.
---
Dunno. Some people are just like that
---
On my server truefaith sells for 30g so farming for it isnt worth it compared to the price.
---
&gt;1. Weird vs popular is a societal expectation/norms argument. My point was it's subjective and you don't need to swim with the tide. 
---
Your point was that somehow spending time in the sun drinking on a beach for 2 weeks is just as normal as spending 20 hrs a day for 2 weeks playing a game.
---
You don't have to swim with the tide, but you should at least get in the water. 
---
We can agree playing video games is totally normal, but playing 20 hrs a day? Come on...
---
It's not subjective at all. I don't know what to tell you.
---
&gt;2. Nice strawman. Long gaming sessions may be vague but it's sure as fuck not a concrete 12+ a day definition.
---
Enlighten me. What is your definition or estimation of a long gaming session? I'll make sure to reconstruct my argument with your defintion in mind.
---
&gt;3. Obviously the dude planned out a 2 week event. It's not like this is a fucking common event. You claiming he isn't an average Joe just because he planned some time off for his hobby is assinine. 
---
Wrong. I never said someone taking 2 weeks off work for a hobby was wrong. In fact I stated the opposite. I wish I could take off 2 weeks to play WoW. I mean... I could, but it wouldn't be to play 20 hrs a day. 
---
&gt;4. Ahh there it is.. finally relative points of view set in. I can see some light in your soul. You managed to say "imo that's pathetic" instead of a blanket statement. 
---
I didn't know it was a requirement to state that the opinion I am sharing with a stranger is indeed, my opinion. My apologies. 
---
&gt;Well... IMO... someone enjoying their favorite hobby as long as they aren't negativity impacting any else is perfectly fine.
---
Would it be perfectly fine if someone was enjoying their hobby of doing heroin all day? Would you be saying "that's perfectly fine, he isn't harming anyone, let him keep getting high"
---
It's an extreme example, but you get my point? Just because they aren't affecting anyone doesn't mean it's not pathetic.
---
Edit: everything above is "imo" by the way. Just in case that needed to be clarified. I don't want any more confusion about who's opinion I'm sharing.
---
You would be amazed about how hard this is to get groups to do. I just find Jef myself if I am in the area and form a group from there.
---
i did herb alc as my first warlock and first character on classic ... had 275 by level 45 ish and didn’t spend too much on it other than here and there
---
Exactly, in my history, relationships where you can playfully throw out jokes to each other are the healthiest relationships, but that doesn't mean we cross the line every now and then!
---
If I was driving king anything when I read that, it would be spit all over my phone. At least someone here got the reference
---
Has to be looted manually unfortunately by the looks of things.
---
You get it in the auction house for around 50g or so.
---
...or from the pyromancers in LBRS (side hallway right before you get to the spider boss)

Here is mine.  I use a mouse with one of those 12 button grids on the side and set up my bars accordingly.  Several different addons but the big ones are Dominos, LunaUnitFrames, and WeakAuras 2
---
It drops in LBRS just before the spider boss
---
That would be an interesting change.
---
Locks get a renew, and depending on the circumstance a flash heal, but thats only if they are low on both health and mana to allow them to tap.
---
Tanking in retail is a joke compared to classic and its still the role with the most responsibility.
---
I tank ony and mc and I still don't want to carry randoms through dungeons for no reward.
---
&gt; However, it looks like the community is a thing in the server, even if there's so much people.
---
The thing I missed most about WoW back in the day. You had your resident trolls and ninja looters, your progression raiding guilds, the insane PvPers. And the there was Moil who had every enchant recipe, and was the go-to guy for anything you needed. Akkurdal the Warlock for stealing the latest PvP specs from. The list goes on, including Alliance I saw in my battlegroup I started to recognize!
---
Back on Shadowsong I rarely had the schedule for raiding, so I pugged a lot. Eventually, I built up enough of a friend list and reputation for doing my job as DPS (and hopefully being entertaining to play with) that I could get regular fill slots and was offered the chance at rolling on some gear. I am hoping with Classic that I get to that point again. I can't say for sure that anyone actually respected or enjoyed playing with me, but it felt like I had earned at least a passable reputation.
---
Opening dungeon/raid-finder to people not on your server really did a number on destroying the social structure that had developed.
---
I didn't say tanks weren't allowed to roll.
---
I don't _like_ it, but I didn't say anything about that. I'm just saying that if given the *choice*, I will reduce the amount of competition as much as humanly possible because it is such a rare drop for a dungeon that takes such a long time.
---
&gt; but the entitled attitude of 99% of the playerbase doesnt wanna make me play at all anymore.
---
And how are you any less entitled than everyone else? You think that because game design has forced your role to be a requirement for the group, you should be allowed to roll on anything you want? That anyone who disagrees with you is a liability and not worth bringing? *Horseshit*.
---
Everybody just wants to get their own loot. Everyone brings what they can to the party, and they do what blizzard *designed* them to do. It's unfortunate that the Vanilla itemization has so many conflicts with so many roles, and it's unfortunate that due to the spec viability and general raid composition, people are forced to farm gear for multiple roles all at the same time.
---
But dude. *You're* entitled. And you know what, ***I'm*** entitled too. **Everyone** is fucking entitled. The community is bent on min-maxing and that has forced people to adamantly pursue their best in-slot items as efficiently and quickly as possible. And yeah, this pressure makes people say and do dumb stuff.
---
**That** is why we are in this situation. *Not* because some people are more "Entitled" than others, but because the *community* has forced them to be this way.
---
Argual Oceanic. Bunch of guilds were colabrating to drop the head so they all got the buff.
---
 [http://www.wowclassicbis.com/](http://www.wowclassicbis.com/)
---
I would recommend a dagger over a sword. Early tanking you want to focus on a one hander that has the highest atk speed, which is typically daggers. This is because a lot of the rage you will be generating will be based on each atk landed, not on how much damage that atk did.
---
lootgoblin behavior is unhealthy. most people can recognize this as weird/anti-social/toxic without knowing why or being able to explain it to aggressive goblins.
---
Go to wowhead classic site and type in whatever you're looking for. But the pattern drops off the caster mobs in lbrs on the lower level once you get into the pit area where all the tents are.
---
boo fucking hoo make your own group crybaby we arent your slaves
---
Yeah and late game 10g is nothing.
---
Yes, dps is high supply with low demand while the inverse is true for tanks. Basic economics
---
Lmao yesterday I was running BRD, some PvP was happening outside the portal so I popped shadowform to get in the fight. Enter dung, first pull tank almost died. I'm sitting there thinking I got interrupted or my macros were failing... I was still in shadowform.. was a good laugh.
---
Thank you for this amazing response! Saving for future reference.
---
[This guide](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/mage-aoe-farming-leveling-classic-wow) on WoWhead is actually really good. I leveled my original mage on retail mostly AOE grinding after playing a rogue and it was a nice change, and usually a lot of fun.
---
Yeah I got one for like 5g on Grobbulus, it lasted me a loooong time
---
Horde sorry for not mentioning that.  
---
So not until I put 3 points into improved blizzard?  
---
I heard it's possible to Aoe grind with Arcane Explosion but I don't know how to go about that.
---
I want to hear from you guys :)  That's why I made this post.
---
Don't enchant at lower levels honestly, save your gold and use it for prebis
---
I’m for TBC :D
---
Exactly.
---
DM = Deadmines, and it's spelled Berenstein Bears.
---
The UI for this looks cool. I will definitely check it out.

Who is healer?
---
Rotten is healer.
---
????
---
Just quit the game and do something else with your time. Why all these threads “how do I force myself to play when I’m not having fun”. Just stop!
---
How about you bubble hearth out of this thread
---
Bears have higher health than a boar, but lower defense than a boar. Ultimately they come out about even in tankiness to the boar, but they don’t have the boar charge which is SUPER amazing
---
First and foremost the damage deals job is not to pull aggro.
---
Just say no
---
Games out for 2 months, grind could not have been THAT long ..
---
Found it easier from the UC (via trade /lfg).. often times I'd run all the way there and find out no one was there.
---
&gt;Don't know if you are playing with a DPS meter, but that sounds like meter mentality.
---
It's a DPS mentality. Playing the role correctly means doing as much damage as you can with out pulling agro. This means deviation from optimized DPS rotations to stay below tank threat when needed. 
---
As for not using dots... that's half my damage potential while I was DS/Ruin, and it's even more than that now that I'm SM/DS. The upside is that my longest running dot(30s) is siphon life... why is this an upside? because I estimate that it pays for it's self in 9 seconds. If the mob lives longer than that, then that one dot has generated mana for me in the form of life taps.
---
As for slowing the group down... I honestly don't have that issue. Most pulls I just need a single renew. Most of the time this will put me at nearly full mana/hp by the end of the fight. If I'm lacking, then I drink as needed.
---
That is fine.  But then there is literally no way I'm ever going to join a full LBRS run ever again, in that case.  I will find a group doing first 3 boss spams, and the pool of tanks willing to do full LBRS can continue to shrink.
---
It's worked fine for me.
---
It still has some syntax for posting groups that I can't quite understand. But for finding SM and BRD groups it seems to work.
---
That’s stupid. People don’t act the same way as a commodity. Been plenty of instances where I’ve been in an all dos group and it’s filled fine. Tanks and healers also don’t want to deal with starting groups and will do other things while looking at lfg/trade keeping an eye out for something.
---
Isn’t bis but it’s ok. Neck on the other hand is bis
---
I was directing this threat with regards to single boss fight tanking where multiple targets aren't a factor.
---
In order to maintain the highest amount of threat on a single target sunders should be applied only when there is nothing else you can do or are waiting on CDs + over 80 rage.
---
I use a mouse over macro and a button on my mouse to do it. Something to the effect of:
---
\#showtooltip
---
/cast [@mouseover] [ ] Pick Pocket
---
*edited for formatting
---
I too do not have that problem. Yet!
---
You can, but a big issue is you cant shadowburn and drain soul the mob at the same time. Shadowburning mobs as they die is a ton of damage, and youre giving that up every time you press drain soul which does basically nothing. Its just very, very tedious drain souling every single mob knowing you could be mashing shadowburn and doing some pretty good damage and having fun \*like literally everybody else in the raid\*, but youre just bogged down by this responsibility to keep gathering shards forever.
---
I got ganked in STV, spent a ton of time finding groups for Scarlet Monastery, and all of my irl friends have stopped playing because they used up their vacation time.
---
But I'm almost level 40 and am gonna get my free mount soon, so that's nice.
---
What would you say is BIS?
---
Badger
---
So efficient = selfish to you? I just can't follow that line of thinking, I don't understand why that's a bad thing at all. Of course you're trying to gear your character in a smaller time frame, why is that bad? 
---
&gt;What’s so wrong about having to win a roll. If you lose oh well I can run it again and again.
---
But why do this if you don't have to? "Oh well I lost HoJ hahaha, let me farm this for 30 more hours to have another chance to lose it! That'll be fun!" 
---
Like, I get it if you're playing casually and don't have anything better to do, but I would think even casual players would get tired of losing gear rolls at some point.
---
&gt;So because the only thing that maters is my loot and my progression I’ll make sure that if it drops it’s mine.
---
I mean.....I'm not playing the game for hundreds of hours for someone else, I'm playing it for me and my progression. So yeah.
---
they are out there
---
A literal "talk to the hand" scenario.
---
&gt;Why are people putting so much stock in these lists? There are absurd prices for greengear of healing, of shadow power, and of frost power.
---
Because in PvE encounters these are considered the 'best' due to the additional damage/healing you gain from them.
---
&gt;People really think that the bottom line is extra damage? 
---
Basically, yeah.
---
More damage = Kill boss faster = less mana needed = faster fights = faster content  
---
&gt;When they run out of mana constantly or die in 2 hits do they wonder why? 
---
Even wearing greens in MC, you won't run out of mana too often on most bosses as long as your guild is decent.
---
And if you are a clothie, you are going to die in 2 hits in MC anyway. 
---
&gt;This seems to be happening with damage dealing warriors to, to an extent. 
---
Yup, because DPS warriors aren't really expected to tank or hold aggro, so pure damage items are beneficial for them.
---
&gt;Quite a few people I've talked to won't even discuss the items and alternatives without getting upset and just pointing me to a bis list.
---
Find less shitty people to talk to.
---
They have.
---
Currently playing a 60 Orc Rogue on Kromcrush, doing some raiding now that I have most of pre raid BiS and some raid BiS. Does anyone have a recommendation for an alt to start leveling that isn’t very similar to rogue? Any thoughts would be helpful in my decision.
---
PS: My professions are 300 skin / 300 tribal LW, and I was considering dropping skinning for engineering once Battlegrounds come out
---
First step is admitting you have a problem. Then on Monday you do a fresh schedule, you work out before you can play 3 days a a week. It will feel good and next week you stick by it. There, fixed.
---
At no point in a duel, let alone tournament, is it considered reasonable to stop mid-match and type that out. No competitor in a fair match would stop to do that. It is wholly evident of his involvement and he should be fully disqualified as well. There are no warriors in this event that need a pointer that you can demo shout a rogue out of stealth. This is barrens-chat level advice for someone competing at the highest level.
---
That's like me telling Usain Bolt to tie his shoes before he runs. There is no valid reason to ever stop and say that, especially mid-match.
---
A new fantastic point of view.
---
those f\*\*king jack-o-lanterns though
---
Both Fiery and Lifestealing has high proc rates, around 6-7 PPM with Fiery having a slightly higher proc rate. Both are very useful during leveling, both in PVE and PVP.
---
Fiery does proc more often and is considerably cheaper than Lifestealing so I'd personally go with that until level 35. If you have spec'd into Retribution you will start getting points into [Vengeance](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20049/vengeance) at 35 and that might change things. Now, I can't remember exactly how Lifestealing used to work and I can't really find any solid info on it, but I believe it could crit. And if that's the case, since Lifestealing has two components that can potentially crit, damage and heal, then you'd probably get better Vengeance uptime with Lifestealing rather than Fiery. You gonna have to somehow confirm that last segment yourself tho because I'm not entirely sure that's how it works in this version of classic.
---
Glad you found a way to enjoy spending time together, I have had similar experience playing alongside my son who is playing for  the first time.  I have my main but we now have a lock hunter duo at 21.
---
A good call, I actually use leatrix as well for their other utility. Solid addon - can recommend
---
So I’m a 57 shaman and the one gripe I have is that I could have rolled literally anything else. Feels bad. 
---
I think I’d be happier as any other class except for a priest and obviously a paladin but I’ve already invested so much time into this character that I can’t reroll yet.
---
As a warlock who leveled tailor enchanting, I urge you not to do that, at least not from the start. Level with money making gathering professions, like skinning and herb/mine (you can only track one thing at a time so don't go herb and mining).
---
Once you're a higher level with some gold farming options, swap out one or both of those professions for tailoring, alchemy, etc
---
I'm currently leveling an alt and doing herb/skinning, selling the leather and banking the herbs for when I swap to alch
---
I do this every time. It's a lockpicking fee.
---
You shouldn't let your minion tank either. Blueberries aren't optimal for any PvE mobs you should ever be fighting. Any other minion does more damage, and you can either fear tank or just drain tank any enemy you come across. Nothing like chain pulling 15 mobs between eats.
---
Tanks in our raids dont even have time to sunder as the threat is pretty low for the cost of a gcd. Our fury warriors do the sundering.
---
At the end of the game consumes/buffs and just raw damage will be your best source of threat. Defense cap and full prot is 2004 mentality.
---
Sorry, you’re right there. Bats and owls are basically even. Birds have lower attack, but higher armor.
---
I love end game, but it certainly isn’t for everyone. It can be an incredible time sink, gathering for food buffs and pots. But that’s the draw of classic.
---
It's just south of the big eastern white-columned war temple place. Warrior's Terrace I think it's called. You can see the bank from it, across the water. I had to spend some time there hanging out with the LW trainer, so I have recently been through your struggle lol
---
Onslaught is from Rag btw. Lionheart is maybe what you were thinking?

QA: Hey Carl, you can't make some trash 40s blue be a bigger model than legendaries!

---
I think most of the population at level 60 is the hardcore crowd, that is more likely to be the type of player to do special runs and/or leave early once it does not benefit them to stay.
---
I would say the majority of the player base is still leveling up. Give it a few more weeks and there should be more players that just want to play the game and won't be as anal about specific runs and only doing specific bosses.
---
Salt shaker is for LW only
---
&gt; Question2: Any tips and tricks on doing DM:E jump runs better? How do you usually split up your loot and proceeds?
---
I usually run with a guild group, or friends. What we do is 1 person collects it all that's not needed. Vendors all the blues (or shard them depending), and splits it up after everyone is done. With books, that class would get their book as their "share" (except the purple book of course that thing is huge money). If things are sharded makes splitting much easier, otherwise just note your starting gold pre-vendoring, and ending gold post-vendoring.
---
Mining nodes as well, split them up as evenly as they can, you can take something specific as your "share" based on average prices on the server.
---
&gt; Question1: Alzzin (last boss of DM east) is purported to have interruptible spells, such as innervate for example.
---
There's nothing really interruptable, as they were on private servers sadly.
---
I feel like you people are implying that if an item is reserved it turns all other items in the instance off. I recently joined a hoj reserved group on my mage, I got my boots and belt and our healer got the golemlord trinket. And guess what, the world keeps on turnin.
---
It's easy to tell your guild to wait for 3/5 sunders and that will generally be a good mark in MC for people to start DPSing.
---
It's much harder when there's no indicator and you just have to wait an arbitrary amount of time or %.
---
Because people didn't have time to teach tanks how to tank. It was easier to tell them to use sunder in a pinch than to explain priority and mechanics.
---
Also, Shield Bash is underrated. It produces more threat per rage than HS or Sunder and only requires 10 rage so if you're rage starved you can often shield bash one guy and sunder sunder or revenge another when you otherwise couldn't use two abilities on two people.
---
I tanked a raid without sunder once to prove a point to a friend. Eskhandar's + HS spam is very potent.
---
Spend a month of your life achieving nothing and then tell me your stance on the matter.
---
Yeah perhaps the same will happen for me in the future.  I have made quite a few friends while running dungeons but in my personal experience we never talk to much beforehand.  
---
Either way I'm not biased on which style of LFG to use as long as the end goal is a enjoyable social experience for me.
---
You can walk past literally everything at 60. Just hug walls, the aggro ranges are pathetically small.
---
You need scepter ofc to start in the middle of the dungeon.
---
So say a rogue is talented into daggers , and has a total of 310 daggers. What would the hit % need to be. A few upgrades I lost about 2% hit from tier items... but I sit around an additional 5% hit now instead of 7%. But 5% with 310 wep skill
---
I would love it if there was something with priests. Like if 2 priests see each other, not in shadowform, there should be respect like, "Yes, we are the Holy ones." Wish I could nod and say "Father." And they could do the same. Would be nice.
---
Edit: Priests of opposing faction, of course.
---
**Why do the BOE items not just bind if someone rolls need?** 
---
Seems like such an obvious solution and I don't see anybody talking about it.
---
It is? How?
---
Personally I just flirt a lot and giggle.
---
I wouldn't reserve items because I think I'm better than someone. Just optimizing the group.
---
If I can get 5 people who all need different things, that's better than a group with 5 people who all need the same thing.
---
And we are fundamentally different. I don't need a guild to carry me and I don't feel the need to accuse strangers I don't know of being less skilled at the game.
---
A quick look at your profile shows that you're only really capable of throwing ad hominem garbage around. 
---
It's funny how all of this self-gloating comes from a ranged dps class, the easiest role to play in a raid situation. But it's all good, you'll grow out of it eventually
---
Yes, there are several. Wrath tends to be more popular with the casual crowd, TBC has a lot more overlap with vanilla players.
---
As long as they are willing to let server communities stay put in their chosen expansion I don't think it's a bad thing to launch new separate options. I doubt Blizzard will be rushing to put them out though.
---
I agree, classic has been a blast and I would be love to play BC if it was rereleased.
---
When I first started playing wow I hit 70 about a week before WotLK released so between being a fresh 70 and still new to the game i got to experience the BC leveling zones, and I got carried through 1 karazhan raid and that's it. But I played the entirety of wrath and while it was a blast, I'm not sure I would want to play it again.
---
Yes :)  
---
Spoiler; It's 25% and not entirely consistent for quests. Also not active in lvl 1-10 zone quests afaik.
---
My ravager runs tend to be faster and more efficient than without. There are definite times where it's useful to run with ravager. I often switch to a different 2h or sword and board depending on mob pulls and how the healers mana had been looking. I respectfully disagree that a warrior should never tank with ravager.
---
PvP deaths don't degrade equipment
---
RemindMe! 2 days
---
If u go west from the bank you leave darnassus
---
...What?
---
Are you contributing dps to speed it up? That's what a good healer would be doing.
---
I believe the one I'm using is Tidy Plates if memory serves. Away from my PC right now but I believe that's it
---
Honestly, I think 95+% of the population feels the same way I do.  Most of these groups sit in LFG for a long ass time because of all the reserves they have and I feel like that's punishment enough.  It's also not even close to a big issue on my server, maybe 1 out of 20 groups has an item reserved.  MAYBE that high.   Calling them out in LFG/Trade chat just makes me look like a flaming jackass.
---
Oh wow.
---
I misread the tooltip then.
---
Cats gain extra AP from agility [40 +(agi x 1)]
---
Bears gain no additional attack power from agi.
---
A caster might be good, something like a mage/warlock to farm things your rogue can't.
---
Alternatively, you can try a healing class such as priest/shaman. (I would say druid but the leveling is very close to rogue)
---
Seems one healer was a bit uncomfortable with you DW so he expended mana unnecessarily as the other had much more to give. That is a lack of healer communication imo.
---
And that’s the problem. MMOs are not single player games. You need a group to progress. Your group helps you. Your group gets equal shots at gear. It’s not just a you and your gear. It’s a server being built up. It’s a community. You get your shot just the same as everyone else. Reserving shit just says I don’t care about the community of the server.
---
Rage generated from white hits or damage taken doesn't generate threat (the damage obviously gives threat).  Things like enrage or a rage potion generate threat.
---
If your to the point of paying guildies off for an itwm. It's time for a new guild
---
Not at all, but that doesn’t mean it’s FREE REAL ESTATE
---
Uldaman?
---
Also early 40s is like the best level range to be at, you have so many zones open for questing, Swamp of Sorrows, Dustwallow March, Badlands, southern STV, Tanaris, Feralas, Alterac/Arathi elite quests... my alt at 45 hasn't even started Feralas or Tanaris and has some DUstwallow quests to do.
---
anyone playing at leisure pace shouldn't struggle whatsoever with having things to do tbh, plenty of rested XP by now, you get like 3 bars a day from inns. 
---
Burnout on the other hand... which is why I wouldn't suggest people to run dungeons over and over tbh, it's not fun for most of us.
---
Huff wrong side =)
---
Shadowfang on my server used to sell for 200g a few weeks ago. Is now at about 30g. I had one drop and I'm wondering if I should hold on to it or sell now?
---
If your tank always makes sunder 3rd hit then no threat issues from DPS, and it gives the DPS a go time, I agree with the OP in his min/max philosophy but your point is very valid.
---
Cool I’ll continue to rub lbrs because it’s fun and continue to make contacts with people who don’t necisarly have to need something to run a dungeon
---
Same as you. I probably helped 8 or 9 people in my guild get the stupid reed before a MH dropped. Was getting annoyed as fewer and fewer were willing to help me. We weren't even Reed farming then, just happened to drop when we were doing a full run for a couple of people to get Onyxia attuned. I had quit counting around 50 runs, was easily in the 70's by then. HoJ was the same deal. Took 50 or 60 runs to get it. Still running arena to get the chest.
---
Well said and this is what I say anytime TBC gets mentioned
---
I'm one of those players and tbh pvp kinda convinces you to level up as fast as possible to get revenge... I just switched side from alliance to horde and I kinda felt... comfortable with the looks of their lands. Maybe I just didn't like the leveling zones of the alliance but now I'm just hanging in some taverns, starting some chats with strangers and feel more welcome in those dark woods and stuff
---
You really think a warlock, one of the top 3 gold farming classes in the game, should stand around and wait for 2 of your friends to come to him, using a soul shard to summon your friend for 50 silver?   
---
Id tell you to go fuck yourself if im being honest.
---
No, no, no. It's more like this.
---
Warlock: Having to explain to every healer you get that healing your taps is faster for everyone, including them.
---
Warlock: *deep sigh as you farm shards for the first half of the instance from doing 10 summons for 4 people, somehow*
---
Warlock: Accepting your death after you triple super crit any given boss, landing you after the tank on DPS because you were dead for 90% of the fight.
---
Warlock: fighting with other warlocks over who is going to put on CoS, CoE, and who gets to be a shit lord with CoA
---
Warlock: silently wondering how anyone else in your group got to 60 as you solo yet another elite you pulled by crushing it for 3500 damage with a shadow bolt
---
Warlock: Screaming as the mob resists, or the spell somehow misses, when casting Shadow burn or Drain Soul
---
Warlock: Sounding like a California police officer when trying to place CoS on any mob in Strath or Scholo.
---
Thanks, I fucking hate it
---
People generally understand to Prioritize in that order, Shield Slam &gt; Revenge &gt; Sunder, and that Revenge is the highest threat per rage you can do.
---
However, Shield Slam and Revenge aren't always up. Generally you can use them on cooldown, every 6 / 5 seconds, but what do you do with your globals in between? That's where Sunders go, if you have the rage, which you usually do against a raid boss.
---
Thing about Heroic Strike is, although it generates a lot of bonus threat, it doesn't take up a global, it just overwrites your auto attack, thereby starving you of any rage you may have otherwise gotten from that auto attack. HS is deceptive, and not that fantastic for threat per rage, since it not only costs 15 rage, but also costs you the rage (which you can later convert into more threat) you would have gained from the auto that it overwrote.
---
That's why people only recommend all out spamming HS as a rage dump, when you're starting to approach the rage cap, or in situations where you've got infinite rage (Vael). The problem with starting to use it early, at 40 or 50 rage, is you may end up accidentally rage starving yourself. Better to start dumping HS at 60+ rage imo. Not sure what the general recommended amount is, but that sounds about right to me. You just really don't to starve yourself so that you end up missing the next Shield Slam. Priority should be to always have 20 rage for SS.
---
Another thing to note is that HS does prevent the glancing blow damage reduction, so that helps. However, it doesn't give you an extra chance to proc WF on Horde. Sunder does I believe. Anyway to sum it up, Sunder is both better threat per second and threat per rage than HS, when factoring in the rage you lose from white attacks.
---
Also I don't think the community disagrees with you about stat priority. Everyone knows that Hit is the priority these days.
---
Rolling against melee on that trinket is like rolling on against them on a melee weapon. I say that as a Hunter, though our class shouldn't matter.
---
Now that DM is out it's a moot point anyway, since we have access to the class trinket.
---
Then when ST class quests come around there's the Devilsaur Eye, which is quite decent combined with Rapid Fire and a IAotH proc. Pew pew.
---
Even without those, a mana regen trinket works in a pinch for Hunters and I'd rather use that than take HoJ from melee.
---
Yeah, but falling a sleep, cuz mind blast and wanding is boring. Love MC though.

Other rogues can chime in with their thoughts might have be easier/better farms for rogues but those two come to mind.

Since this video I've switched back to combat daggers and (though I am basically full pre-bis with some MC) I'm able to burst him down with a few well placed resists. No sap needed but I have had some close calls.

I'd still recommend imp sap as it's the safest way to do it.

It's probably related to this -

I don't understand what this has to do with anything. If you'd tried putting LFG "whatever dungeon" in chat, you'd know that no-one ever get into a group that way, because no-one assumes you're willing to create a group with them if they see you looking for group in chat. 
---
However, if you write LF4M, people are generally willing to talk to you. You specifically might not be, but you probably wouldn't whisper someone going LFG and ask if they wanted to start a group either. So they've lost nothing.
---
This is the daily question megathread for classic.
---
Thats not in retail.  You have no idea what you are talking about.
---
Wrath was a very risky gamble. They gave purples to everyone and added a ton of QoL improvements because we asked so. We thought we wanted it, but they didn't. These changes ended up burning everyone out because nothing felt special anymore. Also, best villain that had been built up for a while.
---
Depends, if they don't have time to drink and are below 50% I'll cast a greater heal which cost me roughly 10% Mana but restores 70% of theirs. But yeah most of the time you just get renew and you stay around 50%.
---
I would do that even without mages (mages make it a bit cheaper, yes, but whatever). Or I use bandages. Sometimes even on other players. If everyone would care about those small things, everything would be better.
---
I'm sure that is your experience because you are a tank. I'm sure the tank that I had last night was silently bitching about me pulling threat despite the fact he was using thunderclap for threat and almost never used sunder armor. I was pulling threat with my first auto-shot after waiting like 5 seconds before starting even. I just resigned myself to the fact he was never going to hold threat. We somehow managed a nearly full clear of BRD though. Even did Jailbreak.
---
I passed every Reed I saw drop to the mage/lock in our group because I knew dm would replace the trinket for me, but they would use theirs for a while longer.
---
They don’t join.  They clown the reserves on Reddit and clowns like the OP retort with “unpopular” read:wrong opinions...
---
Here I am, a prot paladin STILL waiting. I made a tank for this exact reason. So I also made a mage and healer.
---
Waiting for groups is honestly one of the worst things in WoW, I'm literally just wasting my time and subscription time.
---
Puggle is better
---
I didn’t know you could only play WoW if on vacation.
---
Oh he was trying to find it alright
---
I specifically did all the night elf quests I could find, in order to get a headstart. I went to Teldrassil at lvl 5. I think the grind gets you enough runecloth to get the rest of the way, but I also did morrowgrain turn ins at the same time. But I'm done now, and still have around 1k runecloth sitting in the bank.
---
Sorry man, but this is incorrect.
---
&gt; Life-tapping after combat only helps if you have bandages or pots to heal you back up
---
That's what siphon life and drain life are for. You lifetap to get your mana back up, then pull and recover HP on the next mob while you DPS (siphon life and drain life). If you have a good pace, you can keep this up and finish each mob with maybe ~10% less HP than you had to start. Keep grinding this way and you should only need to eat/drink every dozen kills or so, once your HP and MP are almost gone.
---
If you are drinking after each fight on a warlock, you are warlocking very wrong.
---
Right but his point still stands
---
When compared to an additional 25% chance to resist stuns, the stamina buff is nothing.
---
Why do you care what people do when that action doesn't effect anyone else? This is the only question I really care about at this point. 
---
Doesn't seem like you should but clearly you do. I'm not diving into a straw man heroin addict example to try and get insight into that question I just want it answered directly.
---
Oh and I'd personally tack a long gaming as anything 2h+. After exercise + food + commute I've only got about 5 hours left before midnight conservatively speaking. So spending more than half of my free time after work I consider a long session. 
---
A more realistic definition of "no life" is probably more along the lines of "spending all free time on one thing". So it's not even gaming specific.
---
You could be a workaholic with 2 jobs and see nothing but see co-workers all day then pass out after your late night meal that you may or may not have had time to prepare yourself. 
---
So as is with most things "a long sessions" is subjective but it's also not a planned 2 week long event that's been a year+ in the making since it's release date announcement that I'm judging.
---
Edit: midnight.
---
That does raise a good point, it does kinda sucks that BRD can only be run once per server.
---
Polar bear from dun murough ( horde or alliance). Love it for the rp. Also, horde lvl 10 with polar bear pet means you've seen the world :P
---
It's absolutely worthless because it's only for 1handed weapons, which an enhancement shaman in a raid should never be using.
---
"Yeah, but does it do more damage though".

Nah i feel you one of my homies goes off when i mention best in slot.

The thing is a BiS list is an easy and rewarding thing to slowly check off.

It is user creates content that is rewarding, simplistic and easy to follow. You can be a legit ape and still work out with little trouble.

Now for working about whats actually good for you. That takes a little of thought. So it is best to find people that are open to discussing ideas of different things like having enough health etc.

You make enough in vendor drops doing the wintersaber grind to pay for exalted with every alliance faction

I find most reserve groups its the tank reserving stuff and as a caster it doesn't matter to me if random tank/melee dps item is reserved.
---
Why does he need to wait? he can still farm his mobs. I can help killing a few mobs to replenish that soulshard, it's what I mostly do if there are mobs around. Sry but I can't understand why you act so high and mighty 50s is a reasonable price.
---
I wanted it because of that reason. I don't like the armored tigers that much. And this is the only 100% speed unarmored tiger in the game.
---
It’s almost like the war could roll for hoj and if they lose run it again.
---
It's not elitist minmaxing to give a tierset aimed at tanks to tank warriors, instead of DPS fury in your raid. Granted: the optimal way to tank is a dual wield fury build.
---
&gt; I would argue that Revenge is pretty low on the list of things to do 
---
aaaaaaand i'm out. 
---
&gt; srsly guys! don't sunder or revenge! only noobs sunder and revenge!
---
OOOOH my wittle pee pee hwurts
---
That's the price you pay for playing the least demanding role that everyone and their mom wants to play.
---
To the front page!
---
That's a very fair point and I'm glad you enjoy running them. I just can't blame someone for getting demoralized after missing out on an item after dozens of runs.
---
Bear Druid gear?

Post a picture of your character being deleted. Do it.

Necrosis, an addon specifically for warlocks, calls out when you get Shadow Trance with an audio cue.
---
If it's costing you too much time then stop doing it? It's just an item, if you have other things you'd rather do in game or outside then stop hitting your head against the wall?
---
This is exactly it. Greed, entitlement, and selfish. Just play the game and roll for items as god intended.
---
Yeah I wasn’t the op. Also agree that Usualy it’s the tanks reserving orbs
---
That models /dance is actually the most spooky shit I've ever seen from Blizzard.
---
Yea I know. I was being sarcastic... Poorly... You won’t lose your job to a computer just yet.
---
I love when a warlock or a rogue are looking for a tank with key for URBS while reserving things, like, dude, wtf are you even bringing to the party?
---
if you can't make him understand that vanilla had shitty itemization that means "his" armor is BIS for all physical DPS, then yeah I guess so
---
my rogue buddy is a bit glum about it but he doesn't blame the players
---
The best is to save your money for a different weapon. You won't use thrash blade once you get the options from the level 60 dungeons.
---
Very impressive!

I’d wait til 55 unless you want to dungeon grind. Then you can pick up mc and only attunement and start that never ending quest there

Mage here, I love running with other mages.

Lots of AoE, split water-making duties, and split-buffing duties.

As someone who has played priest for over a decade now, I think it's fair to say if you see a shadow priest don't expect a raider ;)

There might not be mob competition, but I’m still averaging 1 arcane crystal per 3 hours of nothing but ore farming. (I’m not a rogue so I can’t do anything cheeky there.)

Is this the WoW version of the Navy seal copypasta?

looks awesome and just cleans up the chat log rather than creating some grouping interface like the old LFG thing did.  Will grab this tonight!

I see.  I noticed my main got lead and I couldn't pass to my alt offline; so I have to wait 5 minutes between runs?
---
Statistically the game is currently correct, it just feels wrong because players hitting NPCs and NPCs hitting players is differently calculated. It doesn't even seem NPCs have glancing blows against players.
---
So you use up a shard per mob? That's something new to me please explain.

There's nothing like someone showing up on your KoS list who was

I mean classic has only been out for 60 days. If people are getting burnt out it’s because they are running too much. It’s not like we get any other gear upgrades for at east 6 months.
---
how does using slice and dice lower your backstab damage...that's just redicilous
---
Why invite only clothies, when there are plenty of people who might still need the dungeon for other items, but no longer need the item you are after? If you simply say, LF1M DPS &lt;item&gt; on reserve, you will literally "recruit players who dont actually require the gear" regardless of their class/spec.
---
I joined a group for some dungeon and on the way we ran by some horde and someone in the party typed in full caps, "DRINK THEIR BLOOD." That type of role play made me crack up.
---
Agreed, both of those scenarios are greedy and should be treated with contempt by all players.
---
Bro we’ve done the math like 3 times on this sub already. Your mana is like 300% efficient when used to heal a lock for their dps. Just throw a damn renew and don’t freak out when they tap to 50%
---
Every war can tank it and ferals/rogues can do stealth runs for HoJ. The only melee dps that don't have an easy out are enhance/ret and they're relatively rare at end game.
---
So the sales value of the item determines how you behave in obtaining it. Do you seriously not see the hypocrisy of that? Would you use the same reasoning if you found someone's wallet?
---
Also, food for thought: those "PoS that drop" would probably net you several times more gold than any single epic before you see one drop, if you collected them all.
---
Also, I started playing the game in 2005 and never saw this mentality all the way up to Wrath. Different morals I guess.
---
I think people are just complaining about reserves getting out of hand. Ridiculous groups are rampant in LFG where everything is on reserve to the point where it's laughable. If you're going to be THAT picky about loot in your group, then you shouldn't be in LFG in the first place.
---
It's almost like you were thrust into an organic transaction between two real people. Did the "socializing with others" book have a chapter on this?
---
Yeah sadly, as you can't manually pass it to an offline member, it switches automatically after 5 minutes!
---
Pretty much swap to your bank alt in between and spend 5 minutes auctioning is what you can do!
---
Looks like a grandmothers gardening hat
---
The reason pug’s have trouble isn’t because of low item drop rates. 
---
Items drop, people need them. They should go to people who are going to use the item.
---
Shadow priest?
---
If you buddy up theres like 5+ quests you can finish outside the maraudon portal. Did them all with my GF easily.
---
And also the quest from Ironforge to infiltrate that dark iron dwarf tower.
---
I like the rake. He is one of the first elite pets you can take at around 12. Attack speed is 1.2 and he looks cool. He lives just north of thunder bluff.
---
Pretty sure OP means continuing to spam Sunder after the 5th stack.
---
Well, either that, or it was just an excuse for their excuses to be in the middle of 3 groups breaking stealth :P
---
One issue is that you are not looking at the attacks in the same manner.  It isn't one sunder vs one heroic strike.  It is a sunder + white hit vs one heroic strike.  Is the threat generated from a sunder and white hit superior than a heroic strike?  If your white hit is 100 threat and your heroic strike adds 50 threat through damage, your values for comparison are (260 + 100) vs (150 + 175)\*.  \[These are only for illustration and not actual numbers.\]  In that scenario, assuming equal rage costs, sunder is superior.  If you are rage starved, it is the superior option as you are generating rage with a sunder while a heroic strike prevents any gain from your damage.  Sunders are a fixed amount of threat that exist in parallel to your white damage.  Heroic strikes replace it.  Thus, you have to consider the entirety of the equation to find what the highest threat gain is.  I don't have a 60 warrior, so I can't say what the damage values are, the threat coefficients, and the break point of sunder vs heroic strike.
---
The second part that allows sunders to generate more threat is that they are desynced from your auto attack.  You can dump rage into sunders faster than you can with a heroic strike.  If you are in a situation where you are capped on rage (unsure if this occurs as a raid tank), then you will be using both.
---
The last part is that your healing corps is much more limiting than the threat generation from your tank.  DPS has threat dumps and can moderate their dps to pace the threat from the tank.  Healing is much more binary.  Either your healers can keep your tank alive and the raid proceeds or the tank dies and you wipe.  Prioritizing mitigation when you are uncertain of the quality of your healers is not the worst decision.  I'd rather have my raid go a little longer due to throttling dps back instead of rolling the dice on my healers ability to keep the raid moving forward.
---
At high gear levels, you will absolutely get more threat from a heroic strike, as it scales through damage.  Sunder is a flat amount and can help undergeared tanks be able to hold threat against some higher tiered dps.  This isn't a cut and dry situation where sunder &gt;&gt; Heroic strike or Heroic strike &gt;&gt; Sunder.  Both have their uses and a good tank should be examining their threat output to determine which ability will maximize their threat for a given scenario.  Am I rage starved or capped?  Is the innate armor of the boss so high/low that my damage changes substantially from what I typically do?  Do I only have a few moments to get as much threat as possible?
---
They do need much less agi for 1% crit though.
---
Rank 6 Revenge costs 5 rage. It causes 355 threat.
---
Let me know when you can find another ability that can compete with this.
---
I think they hotfixed shared threat or something. Shit has been buggy and you will get aggro randomly after a feign. (No drinking / serpent sting or nothin)
---
Yer I do AH them. Medium leather is vendor, anything higher goes for more than double vendor price usually. I’m skinning mobs that drop heavy and thick leather at a minimum now.
---
Haha likely was. I think a lot of retail players assume stealth detection is similar. If you don't have improved stealth it's pretty sketchy.
---
Yeah sunder is the best dump, but with shield block you don't need rng hits to trigger revenge, its great for bosses. That was my main point, doing this u can spam revenge on cd.
---
How did you go from 46 to 51 in a day?
---
It's possible to complete all of BRD at 53 if you're grouped with higher levels, but the Lyceum is rough if you're low-level because you'll probably pull extra. I'd probably go with everything BRD except emp runs, until 56, maybe 55.
---
Yep thats my plan, where else did you find darn quests other than teld, ds and ash?
---
Because it doesnt keep track of threat dumps in phase 2 so everybodies threat is just a mystery.
---
A bit farther up I explained what I was doing. There are a few youtube vids that show this route as well. The route has you kill two bosses as well as pick pocketing. You actually get more gold from the boss vendors then pick pocketing, but the PP is still a decent amount between 2 - 4 gold per run.
---
Without the boss kills, its only around 15 - 20 gold per hour.
---
“But ma parses” cries every tryhard dps in the raid.
---
Not to mention you can just take the boat to auberdine anyway
---
Congratz, that's a full day!
---
Most stuns in dungeons ignore stun resist - the best thing about orcs is the higher axe skill imho
---
You didn’t log out in an inn? Animal!
---
So what kind of optimization are you looking for when reserving the righteous orbs? You used it in your example earlier. You're only optimizing your own entitlement.
---
The mere fact that you think a guild is there to carry someone, rather then a collection of skilled players working towards a shared goal really show your place in the dumpster that is shitter pugs. My parses are competative on a worldwide level. Your name is so insignificant that I haven't even bothered to learn it and I'm talking to you right now.

Inner Mara trash farm is 60-80k per hour depending on level
---
Sunder is great threat and helps dps do more phy dmg. Heroic strike is only good if you have to much rage. Sunder talented is 12 rage which is roughly 1 or 2 auto attacks, combine with revenge you have spent 17 rage to keep threat well. Once that is done you use shield slam which is double the threat of sunder and you have spent 27 rage. Sunder is necessary, heroic strike is not.
---
Iirc there is a boss or mob in ZG that gets you completely smashed. You have to alter your settings so you can see.
---
I 2 box a tank and healer so a healer was never a problem for :p Healers also want the offhand so there's something for them even if you're saving the princess.
---
Tanks don't NEED to run a shit ton of dungeons yet people will always be demanding tanks to do exactly that. It's the same as the Tank reserving one or more Orbs from Strath, except that the Deathcharger is so rare that it'll likely never come into play compared to those 40+g Orbs that show up often enough.
---
Inner mara runs. Aoe down snakes, turtles and one pack (5mobs) of elite slimes. Reset the dungeon with a friend. And go again

How does that fix the issue?

no i was confused too, some hardcore people just did testing in the beta to get the numbers, should be the same for hunter except for glancing blows ofc. https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table#weapon-skill

Oh, well then that would answer Geppa's question I guess. I don't play a rogue so my mistake.

At least benediction will last you for a long time!
---
It isn't any greedier for them to want it than it is for the user. The item is equally valuable no matter who owns it.
---
Edit: Let's put it this way. You and four friends enter a contest for which there are multiple possible prizes. You win a new car! You're the only person in the group with a driver's license. Should you get to keep the car automatically, while your friends get nothing? They helped, shouldn't they get something too? In this situation IRL you might opt for a cash equivalent, if possible, and split the profits, but there is no easy way to do that in WoW. Instead of assigning each player 1/5 the value of the item, we can assign them a 1/5 chance to receive it, which is the same expected value.
---
Ya I've been soloing them no problem. Stick with the Slayers though, avoid the demon dogs and generally the initiates aren't worth the effort either.

So what do you do when the tank in your group says he is going to use it, your entire group says ok, well pass to him, gz!  Go to the AH after and  *voilà* , there it is on the AH for 400g from the tank that said he needed it??
---
There is too much gold to be had on BOE epics to trust someone you just ran an instance with. If you won it and said hey, this tank could use it and Im going to be nice, than thats up to you for what you want to do with it.
---
But this has been a debate forever and there will always be people on both sides. Just make sure the rules are set out in group before ever rolling on a BOE Epic.
---
Do people just do normal fucking runs anymore?
---
Generally (and assuming the target has 5 sunders already) my tanking priority/rotation is:
---
Shield Block &gt; Revenge &gt; Shield Slam &gt; HS
---
Since you are always keeping Shield Block up you should also always have Revenge proc'd so you can use both of these on CD every time. If you have enough rage you Shield Slam, and if you have even more excess rage you queue a HS. Refresh sunder if needed or make sure one of your dps warriors/offtanks are doing it.
---
came here to say this, it's the spider mobs that do it
---
I'm civilized.
---
You'll have no problem finding groups for dungeons of any level for quite a while - people will be leveling alts, slower levelers are still low, etc. If you're NA feel free to join us on Stalagg-US Alliance. We're fairly outnumbered by the horde, fair warning, but a large group of my guild have started alts and you could most definitely feel free to level with us. I could also help from my main.

What's going on hewe then?

I'd love those ELVUI player / target frames if anyone knows what they are.
---
I wish they would release a version of WoW with no ability to Macro and no add-on's.  IMO it takes a lot away from the game when add-ons/macros are essentially playing the game for you.  Unpopular opinion i know, downvote away.
---
Yeah, exactly as I thought. You shit talk a spec you have 0 experience in. GG. Thanks for your worthless opinion.
---
Good call, I confused it with [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18874/high-warlords-war-staff)

True mon, I’ll see what I can afford and actually get the weapon before I make any solid decision

A new alliance member has it on Stalagg, don't know the name though.

Does Onyxia reset today? I'm on Stalaag, although I have no idea if that is relevant

I’m just so far away, almost 48

I've done a couple guild led MC runs and we just don't have the members to fill 40 yet, so we're still pugging at least half and will take basically anyone. I saw a few enhance shamans last time, only issue is that it's MS&gt;OS so you can't roll on tier gear.
---
It's still fun to play with friends. But that's true of any game.
---
Classic, and its inherent combat system, current itemization/item pool, and class balance is just merely atrocious.
---
Almost every class is 1-1-1-1-1, 1-2-1-1-1-2, or 1-2-3,1-2-3,1-2-3. There's no trinkets until end of BWL and AQ40, and even then, there are only 3 activated trinkets, and due to the duration of encounters, they're one time use. Not exactly complex. Only BM hunters are that braindead simple in TBC, and even then, there's a nice 10% dps difference between perfect trinket/proc usage vs mediocre usage.
---
If you cleave on luci adds you have a problem
---
So you become entitled to a piece of gear outside of your intended class gear because you put in a little more “effort”?
---
You ever seen a tank do a dungeon without DPS?
---
It’s the same as DPS doing a dungeon without a tank. 
---
And if everyone was forming parties it would be a game of everyone playing in a one person party because they’re forming their own parties instead of joining existing parties. 
---
It’s a fucking MMO, people make and create parties. It’s intended. Stop making shit up to entitle people.
---
Fixed by who? You've got an addon problem
---
Hunters seem to be the rare class now. I hardly see them in indtances or raids.
---
You should honestly discuss that with the raid leader. His expectations are ridiculous.
---
It's not garbage, it is just more sensitive to poor placement.
---
Given equal gear combat daggers is on par with swords. Equip 6pc Shadowcraft and you'll pull ahead a little with daggers. 
---
I went combat daggers as I was losing my mind with Thrash blade.
---
Daggers is far more fun and spicy as fuck in PvP.
---
Maybe, definitely not reliable, quick or easy enough to be worth it. ZF grind generates more money and most priests get their guildies to farm it with them. only the occasional pug priest really buy those

It's kind of the exact opposite of what you just said. If that Mage had said he was reserving an item, other Mages who already had that item would have been fine to join. If the Mage didn't claim he was reserving the item, the only solution is to ignore other Mages.   
---
Either it's unfair for all of the same class as the Leader, or there's the *potential* for it being unfair for a couple DPS.
---
Really just depends on your server. Likely there’s a lot of tailors so it any not be worth too much. Just look at the cost of the mats on your AH and base the price around that.
---
What (most) people who are asking for classic+ want is exactly what you described minus the flying mounts and leaving the majority of the world behind. Release new zones and sideway raids along with balance changes to do exactly what you described - bring off specs up to par and introduce proper stat itemization.

A lot of realllly bad ally he's going up against in this video. Really bad!!! I always liked LAINTIME The original, Neilyo (although thats mostly if not all from BC but Neilyo 9 is great)

Sap, gouge, blind, stealth, sap, gouge, vanish, sap... Gotta mix it up!

Of course. BoE, just like any other piece of gear follows the usual rules:
---
If it is an upgrade for you, role need. Everyone else roles greed. Ezpz.

&gt;Is this a legit way to make some money or do you think i Will have a hard time finding people to join me? 
---
It's very legit.
---
People look for tanks for Strath Live all the time, there's amazing BiS items for clothies and DPS, but not so much for tanks.
---
It's very common that the first orb is given to the tank, because otherwise there just isn't any reason for them to join.
---
You won't have a hard time finding people to join you, it's quite the opposite actually... You'll probably get PM's from people asking you to tank and offering you the orb.

Verses someone of your same level. The mobs are treating their melee attacks as if they're your same level for armor mitigation purposes.

---
Epic BoEs are the only ones that apply for the 'always need' rule. BoE blues should only be needed by people who will then equip them right there. I always ask first, saying 'hey those are an upgrade, I will equip them right now if I roll need' and they are always okay with it.
---
I see that you're offended. I never claimed that anyone NEEDED a reason, but I will tell you that there have been a lot of times when a comment gets made about a dude playing a female character, and they make outlandish arguments to defend their decision whether someone asks for an explanation or not. I don't care if you play a female character. I was simply commenting on a common argument I've seen used to defend the position.
---
No... not even in Retail does it have a CD.
---
What item did you pick instead of the belt?
---
No one said that.  The only time it comes up is people who have no intent of quitting speculating whether or not others will quit.
---
If your a healer you can full clear that level.

Well next dungeon is ST or BRD? Maybe do a regular run of those and be on the look out for likely solo AoE spots?

This addon is amazing! I wish there was a way to make the messages come in the right order though. It seems a bit random. What I'm trying to say is that the newst msg. isn't always at the top/buttom, but somewhere in the middle. Other than that, YES YES YES!

A lot of sub 60's, and some horrible horrible ally players as well.

What happens if you disable all add-ons

I ask a mage coming across a lonely warrior fighting a mob like to wand him until the mob is going to win the fight just to make sure he takes a durability loss.
---
6 months ago I used two on a private server for world pvp. I thought they were worth it. I didn’t have any mc rings but I had most tier 1 and pre raid bis, a elemental mage staff with the nazz quest trinket. It helps a ton if you get a proc and even better as a frost mage. Most of the time if it procs you won’t get hit again.

Shadowburn is a 15 second cooldown ability that does about the same damage as shadowbolt, but its instant cast. It costs a soul shard, and it puts a debuff on the mob that last 5 seconds. If the mob dies within those 5 seconds, you get your shard back. However, it "shares" the personal debuff slot with drain soul, so you cant shadowburn, get your shard refund, and get your drain soul shard as well.   
---
So basically, if you want to do big damage on a mob, you cant drain soul and get a shard. If you "Just get a shard every trash mob 4Head", youre just not going to do any damage and its lame.
---
In retail there's a "talent" that lets you do it at 30%.

SnD &gt; Evis.

The only reason you see such a high contribution from Evis/Other sources in your logs compared to white auto attacks is because you're not using SnD....

When they're done releasing all classic versions of expansions would they start over with classic classic classic?
---
There's not that much good loot in live strat so most of the people grinding it there for orbs as well.  If you reserve all the orbs good luck finding a group, but it seems that on my server at least tanks reserving the first orb are getting away with it.
---
And considering live strat should take less than an hour getting a pretty much guaranteed orb in less than an hour is a very good return.
---
From my understanding BC added way higher miss/dodge/etc chance but the armor mitigation was there since vanilla. I mean, the tool tip even states it's mitigation against a target of your same level.
---
Onyxia resets every 5 days, so it's 5 days from the last time you killed her. Type /raidinfo to find out the exact time.
---
MC resets today.
---
It sucks. Potion of shadow power went from 10s to 5g each. Its nuts.
---
You can control it easily since the rogue is the source of the cleave
---
Too low level to farm better herbs I'd imagine.
---
I dont own much out of the retail store, but to be blunt...
---
Ive used those couple mounts 1000x as much as some 8 dollar blu-ray i bought and watched a few times as background noise.
---
Hell, i spent more on a steak dinner than 2 mounts would cost.  Was it good food?  Sure, of course it was, but now all i have is a vague memory of it.  I used those mounts for years.
---
Second respec costs 5g though
---
They're negotiating from a position of weakness. To them, they have to come off stronger than they are because they haven't *literally nothing to leverage with*.
---
It seems like you can't deal with MY entitlement. As I said, I will not put up with tanks thinking they are entitled to reserve something because they are a tank when in reality they are trash. You're weak.
---
The soft cap for hit is 6%, so he had to spend an extra item somewhere else to get the last percentages for his dual wielding axes.  
---
If 40% of your attacks are hitting for 11.1% more damage, that means if you have under 24% crit, the percentage gain of 4.4% damage will be achieved by increasing your crit by putting on gloves with that effect (20 agi or 1% crit).  There are many gloves that do this and another option that would have been better here is devilsaur.
---
I always tell the healer that unless a mob is on my face, I will handle it. Being an Undead Alchemist Warlock, I have candy, potions, and cannibalize. Plus first aid. I keep things rolling, usually at 50% HP.
---
Tbh I would just grind out a level doing ZF cleave groups for another level or 2 then just go to BRD and join xp groups there. 4 mages and a priest and rotate ice block pulling.
---
Wdym reset with a friend?

I love that you’re not wrong.

He’ll we just had a huge post advocating for dual spec lol.
---
Want me to rub your feet and call you master too?
---
And as stated thats a HUGE drop off.  Barely a queue at all.  Compared to 10k-18k.
---
Its lower priority based off how much rage you have. You should use it on CD so long as your shield slam isn't up and you don't have over 45 rage.
---
You ideally want to use revenge when you can't shield slam because you're able to heroic strike at the same time.
---
Yeah, contact the creator of the addon that is causing it.
---
is suf capable of working with healcomm?
---
Id say depending on the fight shield blocks priority is always in flux. For a fight like ony her melee hits are almost negatable with a shield.
---
It depends what you're valuing higher at the time, threat or mitigation.
---
https://i.imgur.com/v6YaLwK.jpg
---
Yeah that's something I always refused to believe in but the older I am the more I realize how true it is.
---
Shitty is overstatement it just eases things for the healers and makes the group go faster. It’s a big difference if no one uses one or everyone uses one.
---
I don't think that guide is valid. It shows getting 5 skill levels from performing 2 or 3 crafts. Really, look at how it says to get from skill 151-155. It tells you to make 2 Golden Rods. Yep, two rods = 5 skill ups according to that. Don't count on it.
---
I've used the guide the OP linked, and it's probably the best bet from what I've seen out there.
---
Why would I even bother to grace you with my characters name? You are such garbage that you don't even deserve to know the first letter of it. 
---
And if you wrote your name as every other word in your posts I would not commit it to memory because you matter so little. Do you remember the names of NPC quest givers in lowbies zones? Their names matter more than yours.
---
What happened to playing the game for fun? Why does everything have to have explicit value.
---
Saw this from another post! VERY nice! I wish this was a weekly thread.
---
&gt; Its lower priority
---
&gt; ou should use it on CD
---
exactly, dumbass
---
Threeee of meee!
---
"Many people are saying..." -People who don't actually have sources but are just reaffirming their own opinion
---
Yeah, do NOT do the optimal rotation of your spells and play the game in slow-mo, adding a dot every 5 seconds instead of dumping them on the boss immediately and gaining as much threat as possible
---
I've heard this argument, and I agree that it's dumb. As a male I pick female characters because I generally find them to be more appealing to look at in customization, especially the way many games overdo the masculinity of male characters, and I prefer female voice lines. Something about male characters feels more "generic" too. It's likely become a bit of a habit after some specific instances, but it's also honestly kinda fun to roleplay as something significantly different, why would I just want to be myself?
---
I also enjoy picking the "other" option if it's available, like robot characters in certain games.
---
Do edgemaster's (and other +axes/+swords) weapon skill bonuses apply to two-handers?
---
As a healer, I hate warlocks.  Hellfire and lifetap are the worst.
---
You can farm brd from (I think) 250 up to 300.  You get 3 guaranteed skill ups per run from the doors, plus the lockboxes from pickpocketing.
---
Yea i play on a big server so i guess i could get away with one or two haha maybe not all might be a bad idé
---
And if you do join aoe farms ez
---
Wowhead lists only player given data from the Classic Beta and from the current official Classic Servers.
---
I believe classic.db and others may host private server data, and thus be inaccurate.
---
&gt; Given equal gear combat daggers is on par with swords. Equip 6pc Shadowcraft and you'll pull ahead a little with daggers. 
---
This is just false sorry man.
---
Trash blade mirah is even enough to outdps dagger
---
Its really fucking out of hand. I’m really starting to think fuck doing any dungeons when I reach 60 I won’t stand for this shit.
---
They weren't implemented yet for those skills.
---
As long as people in your group know and agree that all orbs are reserved  before the first pull there is no issue. It’s not a dick move it’s tanking tax. Find a healer that you know well and split orbs with them and just spam Live strat over and over with pug dps.
---
But he had stealth on, so, no one could either find him or help him.......... sorry....
---
SM/Ruin warlock, easily doable but there is only 0.66% chance per run for the shadow damage orb to drop. Shadow priest ought to be able to do it as well.
---
I tried it some more today, and the AI was behaving differently, making the fight much more difficult (generally you want to evade one of the drakes but that wasn't happening), hopefully that was just some anomally and not some stealth fix.
---
[Here's a mage doing it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqXChmWStpc) Though I didn't bother with the complicated jumping and just ran around the platform when fighting the dragons.
---
I don't think there is anything wrong with finding a tank and healer in the LFG chat. You could easily extend that argument and say "make friend, networking, and just get all 5 people from guild/friends list". Sure that's not a bad idea, but sometimes your immediate network of people are not available, it's literally what LFG is for.
---
I like to pull whelps on purpose in the first part of UBRS and Rends room, to spice things up as a healer and for the funnies. If you're not confident in your ability to solo heal UBRS I don't recommend this. Some people laugh, some get salty, but don't let anyone die because you get bored lmao
---
Meanwhile, a glowing red demon's head appears above the rogue...
---
Looks like fuckin dialga
---
Mix it up during leveling. Once you hit end game runs you'll be there for utilities (summons) and you'll be sacrificing for shadow damage and spamming shadow bolt. 
---
I have a warlock during classic as my one and only character. I find you can adjust your play style during leveling dungeons to meet the needs. If you have a decent healer then life tap and hellfire for all the DPS, run with imp for group stamina. If the healers are ropey then just dot and wand and aoe when there are big pulls.
---
It’s because at 60 a warrior had about a 2% chance to kill a mage. He is just getting premature payback
---
Payback for dungeon loot is what I was going for
---
Should be everyone Greed if its just going to be AH'd, but if you actually need it and will use it that should take precedence. People forget dungeons aren't solely to benefit them, but 4 other people as well
---
It's also probably a relatively expensive query so they don't want it getting autospammed
---
I said this the other night, but was kinda wrong at what I said, I was doing MC last night, and I said this is the most fun raiding that I've had since Firelands, I said that firelands was the start of the downfall of PvE and it all went to crap after that, what I meant to say was Firelands  was the last good PvE expansion...imo of course, but classic has such a sense of community, being recognized, and working hard to actually earn your gear with some RnG  involved instead of it being completely rng,  the way it feels on retail, idk how people can go back, classic is such a blast, but maybe that's because I played super late Wotlk  on, and never expansions before that and also ran these raids for transmog gear, but never actually learned and beat the fights, its a blast, just joined a guild, now I can level my alt while I just raid here and there and wpvp  :D
---
will of forsaken is nice get out of mc card :)
---
I saw a (presumably ret) paladin spamming for over an hour last night:  LFM Anger/Arena farm, need heals/tank/dps, HOJ/Savage Gladiator reserved.
---
I have zero problems with reserves.  I think they're actually a good thing because it allows people to self-select into non-loot competition groups.  However, shit like that just cracks me up.
---
I made 15 UBRS groups with no reserves. I barely got anything. It takes a long time to make a group and get all the fuckheads there, if the group maker doesnt get anything extra why bother with all that effort? 
---
As soon as someone gets the gear they need they leave so people always need the same stuff as you. 
---
If there was dungeon finder and it was effortless to get in a group and start clearing then sure no problem I'd do 50 UBRS runs to get my shit but it isn't.
---
I ended up just not resubbing after 1 month because the gameplay sucks the only hard part of WoW classic is herding the mindless cats
---
You can't ask others to fix a problem when that problem is 2 feet in front of your screen...
---
Look at your addons and find the culprit. Stop using it. Problem solved.
---
To find which one is the problem, disable them one at a time, see when the problem stops.
---
Others have suggested Census and Details, so I'd try disabling those first.
---
On the flip side of this, as a tank, I've run all these dungeons so many times that I've seen it all drop a bunch of times and i've passed so that DPS can get it.  
---
Now I want the item, and I'll make a group specifically for that piece and reserve it for myself.  If you want that item, don't join my group.
---
I DO announce before i make the group that it's reserved, i'm not jebaiting anybody here.
---
WW axe can last untill you get the gator axe in mara. being able to tank 2h is more a matter of level then what that 2h weapon is.

Yea thats true im always pulling back and trying to be safe haha

I saw Postal did this, but it doesn't seem to work for classic unless I'm doing something wrong.
---
seems like a worse version of LFG for the sake of "keeping it classic"  
---
why would level 60 want to see msgs about deadmines or bfd lol
---
A DPS upgrade is a DPS upgrade and a warrior is pretty much going to get more dps from any given piece of shared gear than a rogue will.
---
I always took that as more of a joke. It's because as you're running all over Azeroth, it's usually your characters backside that you see. It's the default view. I don't really think most people who pick a female character do so to ogle at a pixelated butt.
---
Undead must always cannibalize the corpse in PVP. I usually avoid PVP but you bet your ass I'm cannablizing the corpse if I kill an ally.
---
I can sell a bag of dog crap to a simpleton for $20. That doesn’t mean actually worth that much.
---
The best PvP vid of that time was Serenity Now wiping out the funeral service. Great stuff
---
I don't know. How can I test this easily?
---
You're doing it wrong
---
im pretty sure as of right now it has
---
It eliminates the "everyone need BOEs to sell them" mentality and  allows people who will actually equip the item to roll need without the rest of the group complaining.
---
To be fair, it probably would function as such.
---
Orc flesh. Tastes like chicken
---
You mean find work at the top of the damage meters?
---
Pretty much, yeah. I'd buy any epics that are BiS for the next 3-4 phases (i.e., I happily spent 225g on Myrmidon's Signet as a tank warrior) and then focus on any professions you have or recipes/formulas you need for raids. I wouldn't (and haven't) spend money on purples that are only BiS for 1-2 phases. Enchants are lowest priority unless you've got BiS gear from raids already. Outside of that, the only enchants I use are either blacksmithing attachments (shield spike, mithril spurs, and steel weapon chain) or fire resistance enchants for MC. 
---
Epic mount is lowest priority in my opinion. If you just continue to play, it will come, and especially with DM releasing, money is becoming steadily easier to make.
---
MOM.

HOT POCKETS.

Do you not understand a simple joke? God damn y'all are hyped over this comment haha
---
my main toon is a female, but I just liked the look of female troll vs male troll. My other character is a male orc.
---
&gt; Fiery does not scale right
---
you're in the 40's. fiery is fine. and you can use fiery, sharpening stones, and gift of arthas pots all together.
---
Yeah I use it myself. Such is great but it still may be the case that people have stacks of 9 or 4 or 5 etc to sift through. Add-on alternatives are good but I occasionally get situations where it takes a while to "load" an auction so in that case if the difference is minor I might end up paying a bit more for a full stack instead of trying to do like the cheapest 4 + 3 + 7, etc.
---
Why are people so judgemental?
---
How go you get the buff? I've tried talking to the guard next to it. Doesn't do anything
---
Lol I'm not offended I don't even have any female characters on classic except my gnome bank alt. I'm just asking a question. I don't understand why people think it's weird to play female characters.
---
This is literally what the ClassicLFG addon does, yet this is met with praise.
---
Well, to be honest, I've seen tanks reserving the first orb, but calling dibs on all of them could turn ugly, fast. I mean, if only 1, 2 or 3 drop, it's all good, to some extent, but I've had runs with 5+ orb drops, that's 100g+ in your pocket, chances are some group members will get jealous at some point...
---
You pull the observer with the king doing solo runs?
---
How about seers village? Still agility monkeys there but people used to just chill in the bank and chat.
---
Or karamja fishing docks. Now just bots xD
---
I understood your point. People took my comment way too sincerely.
---
Today is too stinkin hot outside and I haven't stopped sweating all day and because of that had a messy wipe then had to rewipe a couple hours later
---
I rarely eat while I play, but I drink Chai tea with honey.
---
They have to be in town to get the buff?
---
95% of people playing this game are male...and there is a crazy amount of female characters running around. I just assume everyone is a guy.
---
classicLFG does the same thing.
---
No... they never did.
---
Attack speed doesn't make you hit harder, but a weapon of the same dps that it slower will hit harder because it has higher damage.
---
Thank you that means a lot to me.
---
Add that to the calculation then.  I'm not trying to deliberately ignore any factors here.  The idea that Heroic Strike is better than Sunder whether at 0 or at 5 stacks is not a simple discussion.  You clearly read my post yet you only nitpick that I forgot something.
---
There are so many factors that affect each tank individually that a flat statement without qualifiers is as wrong as the statement it is refuting.  I've not mention racials, world buffs, party composition, latency, macro use, or talents.  These are highly variable and have more of an impact than my simply analysis.  If you want to push the discussion then you should make a spreadsheet that covers all pertinent stats and calculates for each boss in the game which is better.
---
This is a problem that affects more than just threat generation.  Certain abilities and rotations become more viable as they scale better with higher gear.  From what I've seen and read, heroic strike scales better but there is a breakpoint where sunder is better.  I'm not trying to say that sunder is the best.  I'm saying it depends on a whole lot of shit that throwing out guides that are much higher level and not as technical is doing a huge disservice to the community.
---
I don't find it hard absolutely, just relatively hard. I can do live just fine, it's just not fun. Go cry to someone else
---
Boring
---
Four of us started to farm an eye for one of our Priests.  Slowly but surely others from guild came to help.  Eventually we have about 15-20 people and were just rolling over everything in the area.
---
4 and a half hours later.....
---
I was more wondering how rare it is to drop since its a world drop.
---
I typically start with a little prep talk reminding myself that I'm more important than everyone else playing and if they have a problem with that then they're just hater losers who can't handle my xp/hour and need to be added to my ignore list immediately. Then I'll join a dungeon run but leave after the healer drinks a couple times and then I'm typically ready to go. So then I'll just run around and grab every spawn despite the people questing on these mobs, work them into a small pack, frost nova, cone of cold, blink away, and blizzard them down while flexing in a mirror despite being 124 lbs as a 21 year old dude whose currently skipping class at community college. It's not necessary but is helpful when I complain to my guild mates that someone questing is taking a couple of my mobs.
---
I go with Darkshire but I hadn't considered Sentinel Hill. Definitely not Booty Bay especially considering it raises your risk of getting ganked by a lot.
---
So what's the grip with Vrain Cana?
---
Signed an NDA. can’t discuss further
---
Nah, we've had two paladins win OEB and they've consistently been our lowest DPS in MC. I leveled as ret - it's great while leveling. Even in 5 man dungeons AFAIK. But in a raid setting with longer fights, they'll get outclassed unless doing something gimmicky like spell-power ret with MCPs, Shadow Oil, and Righteousness. And even then they're likely to get outclassed.
---
Don't get me wrong, I have no problems bringing ret paladins along. In fact, we had some spellcaster DPS that screamed out "OMG I LOVE WHOEVER JUDGED WISDOM ON THE BOSS" which may not be the greatest use of a debuff slot (I assume? I've always been a healer so idk) but I guarantee that was a ret pally. Ret paladins are great utility, but let's be real in admitting they're not viable contenders on DPS meters the vast majority of end-game fights.
---
Shit, mine slaps me and tells me to do the dishes fucking retard when I call her that.
---
That literally means that the bag of dog crap was $20. Anything ever sold is worth exactly as much as it was most recently sold for.
---
The only way I logout
---
You fail to mention that almost everyone in the group will want the trinket and that most people are too stupid or lazy to fish for Jed. Then the few that arent will fish too many times and get locked out
---
\+1. I agree with the entire roleplaying as yourself.  I used to be big into GTA V RP on FiveM....  I roleplayed as a gay male on there... why would I RP as what I am irl (straight male).. Its more fun if you put on an act and a character... I never got into WoW RP, just bc I dont like text-based RP... It's always interesting to see all these streamers on Twitch who RP as stuff completely different than what they truly are. .. adds way more immersion
---
Interesting, do you know what details is trying to accomplish?
---
I think it’s funny you guys think he actually has a girlfriend!
---
Gotcha. I guessed Phase 4 because Wowhead shows the highest drop rate off those dragons, but I guess it makes sense since they drop all sorts of BoEs
---
What about Iron counterweight? Any good?
---
Something with a D, makes me think Deck but i know its not that. Mesh used to charge 250 a pop to use his crafting fee.
---
Thanks. Are you using down ranking on your flash and holy spells?
---
Watched a 52 DPS Warrior (Horde) spam LFG for about 3 hours last night looking for a tank for arena runs.  Other than the rare Druid tank, who does he think is actually going to come tank arena for him?  Any other Warrior wants the Savage Glad chest just like him, or already has it and therefore has no reason to be spamming arena...smh at these fools.

I once sold a pendulum of doom for 400 euros.

---
YES!!  It's BiS for melee well into P2, it's already replaced for hunters in DM.
---
See the pug I went with for half a year on a pserver were more organized than most raids. They even did BWL pugs without wipes and the content was tuned harder than classic.
---
They had consumable lists with mandatory consumable checks for fire prot pots else you got a loot ban, restoration pots for lucifron and the other cursing snake officer. 
---
Spreadsheets and application forms on the internet.

This kind of dedication and I'm happy to waltz through MC in 1 1/2 to 2 hours hoping to get an item if that means that I will pass on BoEs/recipes/bindings/crafting materials.
---
Of course, of course but this took far less time than grinding to 60. I agree with your statement, but rather I opted to max professions and enjoyed a lot, especially fishing and cooking.
---
You have very strong opinions about these guilds you're not in.
---
Easy block.
---
8-10. I use rest exp when it's available.

Its a tradeoff I woukd have taken as a fresh 60 needing warlords command, though, even if i wouldnt now. Especially with these pieces, its pretty common to build the group to minimize competition. Every time i whisper a pug lfm, Im sure to tell them what I already have, and have often gotten into very melee heavy groups where competition for the two things I do still need nevertheless remains low. Maybe some would object to this, and I agree that it feels less shady, but it amounts to the same thing more or less.
---
New character, farm gold, or just be able to chill a bit and play other games. Up to you.
---
*in the pursuit of an upgrade. That expensive item is an upgrade for every single member of the party. Its just a token that 4/5 member need to go trade in for their upgrade, and the 5th guy has the convenience of equipping immediately.
---
I paid 20g each for my group to pass on that gem.
---
Why can’t you elaborate?
---
Female tauren are excruciatingly rare. But so far, all of the ones I've encountered have been played by women. Like, all 4 of them.
---
Just buy them from hunters who solo tribute runs, you'll save yourself a ton of time/headache
---
Its really not tho
---
who long did it take?
---
And what came after picture three? Did she die?
---
There is...
---
It reduces the incentive to join the group.
---
I mean... if you still manage to run the group more power to you. But I question the motivation of those that do join.
---
I'm wrong about the Phase but it is a World Drop so you can't target anything specific to farm it. Just pick a popular farm spot for something else valuable and hope it drops for you.
---
he doesn't anymore as more people have the recipe
---
Not gonna lie, you had me in the first half.
---
Which quest did you grind
---
the only ones it truly affects is themselves.
---
I'd say if you really want to get it, do whatever you need to to get the most dps. You'll be doing it so many times, you'll want to kill them as quickly as you can. I've seen many warriors and paladins during my grind, usually doing the regular quests... And they have it rough.
---
This is really accurate, and you're right - I've noticed much of the same thing happening on my server as well. It seems like people are just generally being kind to each other and I'm a bit flabbergasted.  I'm really happy with this community so far and I hope it continues to stay the same :)
---
A healer can drink their mana bar almost full twice before I drink mine full once, for starters.
---
Water just buffs your mana regen rate. Warlocks have a talent that *decreases* spirit (in return for a shit load of Stam), which decreases this.
---
It also costs them, get this, 2% mana to Pop me to full with renew while we run between mobs.
---
Also, for a measly 10% they can take me from 1% to 100% on a 3 second cast.
---
Their mana will be back before the pull begins.
---
I can tap to full in 4 GCD, the healer heals me once, and we're off in 1/3 the time it would take otherwise on pulls where the healer needs to drink. And there's an immeasurable time save on pulls where heals doesn't need to drink, because if I drank, it would be 30+ seconds of drinking versus 4 GCDs and a instant to 3 second heal.
---
Thanks!
---
Yeah I just don't see a how a male cow/nightelf/gnome, would be more of an extension of yourself than a female human.
---
I guess you’re right. Idk I’m new to WoW and I found the quest system really un-initiative
---
They originate from pools and floating wreckage only.
---
Seriously if you start getting sick of the game go find a brand new player and do quests together. You'll be right back where you were 10 years ago.
---
How did you get to 300 alch but only 225 herb? Did you just buy the mats or?
---
&gt; Not a lot of what you listed are negatives.
---
If you disagree with OP you must be part of the game destroying community!  Get the pitchforks boys!
---
I do like classic/bc paladin class design.
---
Exactly what I did. I'm decked out with lionheart, cloudkeeper, flameguard and  alot of other goodies. Just SVG is quite elusive. I need any level 55+ healer to come keep me up and I nuke the mobs  with 650DPS.
---
It's an easy 20-30g in 20minutes by going 5 times for a level 55 healer. Nobody complains about 90g/hour when not even 60.
---
Of course, once the IRA is maxed out you should switch to your 401k (if you aren't already doing the same here).
---
I don't think you ever played vanilla wow. Dire Maul was released before the honor system for instance https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patches/1.x
---
What you should have complained about was epic class quests before dire maul or hunter demons respawning in 15 minutes instead of 12 hours.
---
When the hell did "reserving" become a thing?
---
why you stalking me
---
IDK about hunters but warriors get 2 AP per STR
---
You found reading what the questgiver told you unintuitive?
---
Yes!!
---
As a hunter, I co-sign this message.
---
Someone had one up on my server for 950g. Insane.
---
No issues here
---
100% this - I even take it a step further and take shadowform off when invited to a party so no one sees the buff. The reality is that it's a very viable way to heal until end game content and I'd just rather not have to explain that to players who just simply won't get it until they play a spriest healer in dungeon role themselves
---
My reputation on my server is the tank that’s always doing UBRS Jed/Rend runs. I’ve been spamming UBRS (specced as prot) to try to get my main-hand for my fury build. Now everytime I log on people whisper me asking if I’m going to do any runs today. I think I’m at around 40+ runs right now.
---
nah
---
Frostsaber Provisions until Winterfall Intrusion unlocked, then only Winterfall Intrusion from that point. There's another quest that unlocks involving the elite giants in the south, but being a frost mage, it wasn't worth it to me. Especially since I didn't have an epic mount before I got this.
---
BRD is so good for healer gear that I expected to get my healing pre-BiS really quickly, but it's spread out across the dungeon and there's more supply than demand for healers with these kind of runs. It's been a lot harder than I imagined.
---
Sash I have. I'd consider Boreal mantle and the boots the other big ones
---
"Rouge"
---
No, there are certain quests where it doesn’t specify where the person is located. It’ll just say ‘go to East of west fall’ for example and it’s not very specific or even correct in some cases
---
Love it when that happens. Got a pair of Glowing Magical Bracelets for 25s when the buyout price was in the neighborhood of 8g
---
What about whorelocks fear?
---
Stick to the plan
---
yea i do this too. wait til they go back to doing whatever and then just kill. so sad :(
---
I honestly don't want to give away the big money makers because even one or two people competing really drives down the price. But check out Thorium Bars - I buy them for 40-60 silver a piece and sell for 1.75g - 2.5g depending on who else is selling them and they sell fast. Look for quests that require AH items but are far from cities. STV quest requires Bloodstone Ore and Tanaris quest requires 2 Thorium Bars. Helps to have an alt camped by a goblin AH to compare prices quickly.
---
That's in an ideal drop scenario. Edgemasters are good to have even as a human or orc since you might be say lucky with deathbringer instead of viskags or vice versa. 
---
The gloves also open up core hound tooth to be used since that does give a steady rage generation along with crit and attack power to scale with your BT. 
---
Additionally, you're also not fighting with combat sword rogues for gear and your entire raid gears up faster. 
---
I'm sure it'll change with the introduction of strong maces in Lord Kazzak and AQ since I dont know any combat rogues that want maces along with axe off Nef but it's nice to have so that you're not waiting for weeks for that ideal upgrade.
---
mea culpa! I actually don't know him... will check him out the next time I visit OG
---
If you're in a situation to make use of the proc as a hunter, you screwed up a while ago.  Then you actually have to get it to proc.  This whole thing is maddening, That axe is probably worse than wearing no weapons because it encourages hunters to do dumb shit.
---
Only 2 pieces of leather? Those are rookie numbers.
---
Yeah I use rested pretty much all the time, I only play about 15 (maybe 20) hours per week and I have a 37, 27, 25, 23 and a few level 15ish.
---
And did she die?
---
Thats when you run into new thinga and feel good about finding it on your own
---
I interpret it a bit different.  I see reserve groups like this:  Hey I'm going after this specific item so if you want it this probably isn't the group for you, but it you want other items then feel free to join.
---
This is just stupid and I hope no one is following that logic.
---
If you need, roll need. If not, greed.
---
It‘s as simple as that. No matter if BoP or BoE. If it‘s an upgrade, be free to need. If it’s not an upgrade and you can’t/ won’t equip it, go for need.
---
Was like that 15 years ago and won’t change just because summer-plebs think they can change simple logic.
---
Free action potions resist the Mc don't they? I know I saw skarms guild cleave him down and I thought that's what they were doing but ive slept since then so maybe I'm way off and their priests are just God tier dispellers
---
Sounds like overheating? Maybe, are you on a laptop? If so get a cooling pad, to help with air flow. If you aren't check temps of your gpu when running the game and when it starts to stutter.
---
I don't think there's much correlation between having a girlfriend and saying "hehehe".
---
Do you have to run back and turn in every 10 mobs?
---
Just tell him to fuck off, youre doing it the way its supposed to be and hes just salty he didnt get the roll. If he had it his way and everyone rolled greed all the time mages would be getting plate gear and warriors would be getting wands, absolutely stupid.
---
that's literally what i said.
---
It depends entirely on what ability you're using. For the most part, you're right, it mainly affects white damage and you can generally look at AP as a general DPS increase. I know of one exception for a Fury warrior and that being Bloodthirst as it is directly tied to AP. Execute, for example, doesn't factor in AP or weapon damage. Only base damage + rage.
---
I saw an MC pug advertising that BOEs, patterns, mats, tier, and weapons are reserved.
---
... Yeah I understand the game doesn't revolve around lot, but wtf would I gain running with them? The experience? 
---
That's like those stupid customers and graphic designers "you'll get exposure bro".
---
IMO any pvp racial is way way more impactful than any pve racial. Like doing a tiny bit more dps is so irrelevant compared to having a racial that makes you win a fight and avoid a ghost run etc.
---
Maybe we see them so often because they have to advertise so long?
---
I'm sure this is a good option for those who need it. Personally, I only join /World and /LookingForGroup when I'm LFG. 
---
As soon as I find my 5, I /leave both.
---
Nope. In dungeons and raids I just spam max rank Flash. I almost never use Holy Light. It just takes too long to cast and usually another healer tops them off before I can finish and it ends up being all overheal.
---
It just seems like a waste of time to manage spell ranks when I almost never go oom anyway. And I didn't even spec into the 5% spell crit for mana sustain, I just use runes and pots.
---
Undead will be a huge impact in pvp while troll will be minor in both.  I'd go ud
---
U missed your shot lol
---
it undid all his keybinds, tragic
---
Yup... and that makes it a pain not having an epic mount. But my greedy ass didn't wanna drop 900g on a mount twice
---
Lol same,I think he was in IF all night
---
Since the guy in the call asked I've done these as both no trueshot bm/mm/sv hybrid and 0/31/20 and there's no noticable difference besides slightly slower running from path finder.
---
 You don't actually have to bait charges so the bm talents aren't needed if you don't. He won't charge until he's at the first pillar on the ground so you can avoid any charges. I find 0/31/20 easier because i don't have to respec for raid and PvP so the extra minute it takes is made up for in respec costs.
---
 You can also wait a few seconds until you see the guard in bug room to pull (i pull bugs alone) and then fd at the wall and freezing trap scatter the two mobs with a body pull when the boss is at the end of his ramp pat and cheetah by and avoid any damage there.
---
WE WILL NEVER BE SLAVES! To arrogant tanks.
---
Yeah hence used to. He got his first week or second and the other one only popped up like 2 weeks ago.
---
At least they're male, amirite?
---
I do use Titanpanel so this maybe the cause.
---
arms is great for 1-60, sweeping strikes + whirlwind specifically is the biggest powerspike you'll ever get while leveling. the only time fury pulls ahead while leveling, if you're worried strictly about performance, is once you get thrash blade and enchant it (quest reward from the end of maraudon, usually level 48-50), and even then it's arguable until you get some hit gear. either way, every warrior spec/playstyle can level to 60, just play what seems the coolest and you'll be fine, even prot can do it solo
---
What is a LIP?
---
Depends on the group.  If you're in a guild group or a friendly group with people talking and such, it's generally need on boe's that you actually need.  If it's purely a pug then probably fair to need roll all boe's since they're essentially like gold dropping.  
---
Say a 300g boe item drops.  Anyone in the group could sell that item and buy an item they actually need.  
---
The only correct loot system is to establish the loot system before you begin the dungeon.  Say all need on all boe blues/epics before it starts, then this issue wont come up.
---
Undeads are kill on sight. 90% of the undead players are dishonourable garbage.
---
Tanks and healers need to change specs more for raids and tanks have a way higher repair cost for plate. It’s a guild we care about the guild succeeding not that every individual is treated 100% equally and fairly. As long as the boss is dead at the end of the night we are good. If that means spending more resources on tanks and healers that is perfectly fine.
---
really? up to 30% faster cast time seems like an awful lot to me. Thanks for your reply!
---
Stop embarrassing yourself. Better delete your comment before someone screenshots this monstrosity. xD
---
Limited invulnerability potion
---
I understand your clever joke bud
---
&gt; siphon life
---
What if you're below 40? Are you just straight speccing for Siphon? This isn't a reasonable outline for someone who doesn't know what they're doing. Let alone on a PvP server. You let your health drop like that and you're gonna get ganked. 
---
Your method seems good for someone who has the talents and gear already, but not for someone who is pushing 30-35 and having to deal with the Hillsbrad/Alterac melee.
---
You can choose to stop responding.  You can block me.
---
If someone responds to me I am most likely going to respond back.
---
Wow what a shitty sexist joke.
---
i couldnt do it man i played to level 38 then rerolled mage. damage and healing rotation mad boring.
---
Yeah that’s stupidity on behalf of the group. I saw 2 real gems yesterday “LF tank strat live (orbs reserved)” and “LF Healer arena/anger (HoJ/Sash reserved)”. Those are stupid players not a stupid system.
---
I usually heal the locks that tap and just keep my mouth shut. But often time I’m drinking after every 4-5 pulls when this happens. Otherwise I usually never have to drink other than a satefy top up before a boss fight/difficult pull. Sure it’s more dps, but having to stop and wait for healer to drink periodically vs not having to stop tends to be slower. Also drinks not cheap T_T
---
Edit: don’t get me wrong, I think locks shud be tapping, just not tap tap tap to 1% hp every time and expect healer to top up and drink. If u tap responsibly that’s all good
---
Most people know by now.  
---
It was way worse in 2005 though, you used to get shit from people just inspecting you in orgrimmar.
---
Lesser Invis Potion?
---
Yeah I'll even help opposite faction druids if I see them etc. Any other class, you gonna die.
---
No no.
---
All BoE's represent gold/upgrades *for everyone in the party* because they're worth the same amount of gold for every player, and every player can buy/trade for an upgrade of equal value.
---
Blue Plate helm drops?   The rogue can sell that for Blue sword.
---
Epic Leather shoulder drops?   Warrior can sell that for Epic Plate gloves.
---
There are plenty of upgrades available on the AH, so passing an item to one particular player denies everyone else of an upgrade that they would have gotten from that item.
---
Don't be greedy.  The entire party earned that loot, and the entire party can use it equally well, so everybody should be rolling for it.
---
Good, that's exactly what they deserved!
---

---
Abandon all hope, because this change applies to everything. If you aggro a mob and it socials with another on the pull, those two are linked until both die or until both leash.
---
A DPS warrior complaining about a tank is literally the most selfish act possible in the game, and the simple fact that he isn't knowledgeable enough to LoS the pull makes that even more apparent.
---
Thank God you blurred the players names. I was hoping to do an exhaustive search to figure out who your group is and on which server in order to harass their in game characters about being in someone's reddit post on the internet?
---
Woulda been a HIPA violation if you didn't blur
---
I disagree. I only need if I actually need it. Otherwise I just greed (early on i used to pass).
---
If you, a priest roll NEED on some plate armor that is an upgrade for me I would either leave the group or kick you. That is nothing but greed.
---
Ah very cool thank you
---
Still a long way before twinks start happening.  Lots of people are banking twink items until bg's drop because theres no point selling them yet unless you're desperate for gold.
---
The animisoty stems from a combination of:
---
- retail players being insecure supremacists who can't accept that their opinions aren't gospel and that the world doesn't revolve around them and sometimes, *just sometimes* other people genuinely do enjoy different things from them.
---
- classic players resenting the fact that the game they loved  was taken away from them and given to people who hated everything about it and demanded that it be turned into something else entirely.
---
Every time some dumb self-absorbed retail cunt pulled that "Hurr durr rose tinted goggles you'll quit when you get to the barrens and see how long you'll be there" bullshit my blood boiled from the knowledge that someone so stupendously arrogant and moronic is being allowed to steal oxygen from actual people.
---
I'm also hiding them in another tab when not looking for anything, it just facilitates the actual *looking for something* if the channels happen to be over-crowded :)
---
No, this applies to them as well.
---
No it applies to everything.
---
My MT back in the day used to always execute spam himself otherwise I would pull aggro for sure. You can use battle stance and stance dance to defensive as needed for revenges or whatever.
---
This really feels like a self hype post.
---
Dude I bet you're a blast at parties
---
If you are doing strat: live for no compensation that's all fine and dandy, but you're underselling yourself.
---
A mage laughs at you because he can both farm 80g an hour AND get a tank who demands nothing for his services.
---
By god, you leather warriors have NO SHAME!

Leather for the rogues damnit! DAMN ALL YOU WARRIORS
---
The riding all over winterspring is the worst part
---
I think addons are so interesting. Was it worth the time spent?
---
So if the tank pulls an AoE pack, you screwed up?
---
If you're farming low-level dungeons, you screwed up?
---
Give me a break.

Ion Hazzikostas, GM of Elitist Jerks, the offshoot of Goon Squad, the 4chan guild in MMO games.

4chan is in charge of WoW. 4chan ruined WoW, just like everything else.
---
Its almost as if, people don't realize Shamans were supposed to be tanks at the start of vanilla. I mean sure they quickly dumped the idea, but yes, Shamans were supposed to fill the same exact roles as Paladins, which included tanking.
---
The sharpening stone affects attacks by that weapon.  For your OH it only affects OH weapon attacks.

---
&gt; If you need, roll need. If not, greed. It‘s as simple as that. No matter if BoP or BoE. 
---
That's just completely stupid and wrong, on top of being greedy.
---
This isn't a difficult concept. 
---
&gt; Was like that 15 years ago and won’t change just because summer-plebs think they can change simple logic.
---
It absolutely was not.  I played from Day 1, and people figured this shit out pretty quickly -- mostly because people would just ninja the item, claiming they needed it, and then they'd throw it on the AH.
---
This isn't rocket science.  Figure it out.
---
Payback for taking rogue loot? I'm not following 😂
---
I'd wait until at least 56 to do Lyceum and emperor.
---
And this is where I agree with you. But the first guys talking about being selfish. If that tank is tanking, so that you can complete the dungeons you want to complete, that’s selfless in itself. We have all tanked, we all know how boring that hero class is. That being said, I’m just a you scratch my back I’ll scratch yours kind of guy. What’s the gold to me? Nothing, what are the pans to him? An improvement, on both his ranking ability, and his day. If no one can wear them accept one person in your group. And they improve that persons abilities in their role. Then they improve your abilities as a group. This is what mmorpgs once were. But since wow, people have become selfish children.
---
🤯
---
yee
---
How did this Druid change genders from the beginning of the story to the end?
---
Maybe I just enjoy tanking? Maybe I don’t have to maximize every second I play for the most gold/hour. Maybe it’s possible to play the game for fun and not as a job.
---
Boe's are gold,everyone Needs gold.
---
It will get fixed in TBC Kappa
---
It's  The value of a BoE is equal to the market value for everyone, whether or not you can equip it. The value of a BoP is the price you can sell it to the vendor to everyone who cannot equip it, and MUCH higher than that for everyone who can equip it.
---
Thus the default is all need for anything of value that isn't bound if you're afraid of ninjas (otherwise all greed), and need before greed on bind on pickup items. Disenchanting falls under greed unless otherwise agreed upon by the group ahead of time even for BoPs that no one uses.
---
If you want to be a generous person and pass on non-binding items that's entirely up to your personal philosophy, but you shouldn't expect it of others.
---
Yeah druid vs druid isn't even that fun. It's like the first druid who tries to go for the kill loses.
---
It's a short duration and it also costs a global to use the buff
---
My first ever MC raid, I spent something like 50-70g per hour on consumables to make sure it went smooth. We had a lot of under geared people, people not even 60 yet, and keep in mind, I was the main tank. I had on titan flask, was popping stoneshield pots, had 3 different elixirs going, etc. We got through 8/10 with ease though, and I do think those consumables helped, because our healers were... to put it frankly, kind of shit at that point. Untrained, didnt' understand a lot of things about raid healing, etc. 
---
At this point, no one in our guild uses consumables and we do full clear of all content (ony and 10/10 MC) in about 3 hours. That may change when we do splits next week and are doing 20-25 man MC. At that point yes, we will probably be using consumables, but it means more gear for everyone more quickly.
---
Some blues last like 10 levels
---
Haha yes! I am the druid Forti! I can solo all the hordes! They base belong to me! Thank you for posting this, so that my fame can rise! I once solo’d 17 horde in the badlands!
---
Yeah, it feels great!
---
&gt; If you, a priest roll NEED on some plate armor that is an upgrade for me I would either leave the group or kick you. That is nothing but greed.
---
That would be true for BoP's, absolutely.
---
But BoE's represent an upgrade for everybody, and everybody deserves a chance to roll on it, because everybody earned it.
---
Stop being greedy.
---
I'm a dwarf paladin. Life's great, everyone loves us. I throw a blessing on everyone I come across and throw a judgment of light or wisdom on their mobs, depending on class.
---
The chances are astromoical that somebody who reserves charger is a raidgeared tank who will stomp the dungeon for you in 35minutes.
---
I sure as heck will pass on the mount that drops every 5000th kill to get my sweet preRaidBiS in 35min speedruns.
---
Think Thunderfury tank with chromaggus shield and 5/5 TPS gear.
---
The whole point of the dungeons are to get better quality items. If you roll need on some armor you either cannot equip or doesnt benefit your character (outside of gold) when I, a warrior tank, could use there will be some arguments over needing when you actually were greeding.
---
As a guy who was gonna sub over the summer after uni I can now say...y'all can keep all the items. Raid by yourselves. Enjoy a dead game. I learned my lesson with sc2.
---
I mean, I guess. I disagree that people are entitled to gold off of a drop that someone in the party actually wants and needs. I personally would let that person just win the item. It’s cooler to get a drop than it is to go buy shit from the auction house. I guess I see the rationale, but I don’t view it that way.
---
But, more importantly, wouldn’t that mean that everyone should roll need on a BoE, so this Warrior here did nothing wrong? Encouraging everyone to roll greed on all BoEs seems destined to promote ninja looting, no?
---
Go intellect for sure.
---
You can load it up! Just make sure you have money left over for your wow subscription!

I'm stupid? You're stupid!
---
I could never get used to using those 9-12 button pads at the thumb. Curse these fat fingers.
---
Cannibalize works in combat.  Easy way to top the charts for PvE is to simply survive the encounter.  Immunity doesn't solve chip/splash damage.
---
&gt; I've gotta get my BiS gear so I actually have a shot at getting into a raid. 
---
This part is just straight up incorrect.
---
Other than Priests trying to get truefaith pattern, there isn't a whole lot of reason to go Scarlet Strat.  Maybe some melee trying to get the unforgiven hat, but in general I don't recall much reason to go to Scarlet unless you want orbs.  Reserving them is taking away what most people will go there for.
---
Doesn't meant you don't find people, but you are certainly capping the quality of people who would go.
---
 This response is pretty much perfect, especially the class balance. Every class is basically the same on retail if you speak from a technical stand point. Heals, CC, interrupt, etc. When rogues even got a heal, thats when the game was done for.
---
Boosted leveling absolutely contributed to ruining the game. Dailies that force you to log in every day and don't allow you to just grind longer hours on the weekends. Since basically Wrath, the game has seemed like it always requires u to get on and do your laundry list of chores every day, leaving no time to actually enjoy the game. All the other points you made were the cherries on top, but those are my top reasons for the game getting ruined.
---
#2
---
&gt; Nah. If he equips it
---
"Hey guys, I totally need this item"
---
"Thanks!"
---
*Hearths back to town, throws it on the AH for 300g*
---
This isn't rocket science, dude.  There's nothing preventing people from ninjaing items this way.
---
Plus, everybody earned that BoE, and everybody deserves the chance to roll on it, because it's equally valuable to everyone.   Everyone in the party can trade that BoE for an upgrade.
---
This is fucked
---
I was AoE farming some oozes in the Hinterlands when I saw an Undead Mage in the distance doing the mechanical chicken quest. I targeted him while I was in the middle of my pull and apparently that was threatening enough for him to start attacking me. He killed me, but I guess he ran too far from the chicken, because a couple minutes later I found him much closer to the starting point of the escort. Then I killed him twice to get my revenge, while he was doing the escort again.

What a cope
---
What’s the difference?
---
Definitely get the Druid to at least 20, getting cat form is a game changer.  It’s not ranged, of course, but it’s solid leveling/questing dps and you can just switch out &amp; heal - no down time.  Collect an int/spirit set and you can heal dungeons just fine.
---
Uh both are fairly weak compared to rares from dungeons. Id pick option 2 i guess.
---
Let me introduce you to you're wrong and don't know what you're talking about. After level 30 drain life is better than wanding in practically every situation.
---
Sounds like you are both idiots. Him for the shit he is saying and you for joining groups as a dps warrior instead of tank.
---
Lmfao bro, don’t even trip. You know that’s just a really special person. I tank and never mind having a platebro even in 5 mans.
---
My buddy just did this for 5 nights straight farming for his mount and I would jump in to heal when he needed it. He always got groups and just got his mount last night. Completely doable
---
I like this attitude. Every dungeon group I put together gets this macro:
---
1. Slow is smooth, smooth is fast. Nothing slows a dungeon run down more than corpse runs. 
---
2. Everyone rolls need on BOE blues and purples. No loot drama.
---
Are shadow priests really a meme spec? Am I wasting my time leveling as one or should I respec to holy for the heals?
---
You need to clear a path for the new player to get to the chest. The new player needs to be aware of the eye and kill it ASAP. While waiting for the new player, I would have someone keep the loot window up on the chest so it doesn't despawn.
---
It's adequate until 270.  In order to get recipes for the imperial plate you have to give a guy a whole ton of thorium bars. Then the bracers take 20 thorium bars to make anyways. This is a massive waste of time. On the auction house you can find the plans for radiant and thorium armor. You can check on wowhead classic to see which pieces last the longest untill its skill-ups turn green and buy accordingly. A few of the slots like bracers belt and Boots require anywhere from 12 to 14 thorium bars each iirc.  once you're done with Mithril Spurs you're going to want to plan this out carefully as thorium is hard to get and expensive as hell if you don't have mining.  (On most servers it's basically being strip-mined at all times)  if you've gone weaponsmith you also have the option of making the polearm blight for a few extra levels past 270 until it turns green as mithril may be a hell of a lot easier for you to farm depending on your servers thorium market and demand. I was able to get to 275 this way because I had a bunch of true silver in my bank from mining, and the mithril was easy to farm up in a couple hours. the rest of the mats at the time were easy enough to buy off the auction house for cheap. 
---
It should be noted if you are already 60 and done the quests outside of scholomance, if you equip your trinket to talk to ghosts, and go to the blacksmith outside of scholomance you can buy a recipe for a dagger off of him that takes mithril not thorium and lasts past well 270 if I remember correctly before turning green.
---
Yea I know, I’ve seen other people’s post which is why I was afraid to even ask.. but I honestly didn’t do anything.
---
shit, i didn't know this, time to get my 2 ring then lol.
---
He's playing a NE as a rogue, nothing he says can be taken seriously.
---
That was already the case and isnt a problem for soloing.
---
You need to train/capture(?) a pet that has that ability. Then you fight mobs until the new pet uses it and - after a few times (this may take longer for higher ranks) - then you will know the skill. 
---
So, when you start fighting with your 'proper' pet again, it will learn that rank.
---
I don't have a hunter so this is just going by what I've previously read in previous threads.
---
Nothing inherently. If blizz could write a good story we would have gotten it already I think. I don't trust it to be good.
---
Again, I'm not some panda hate boner guy. But you cant tell me they werent running out of ideas... Legion being sooner and the old gods after would have better imo
---
As a priest I just switched both second wind and Bria for the two dm trinkets. Is Bria still bis for other classes?
---
Hmm. I suppose an appeal is your best option. They should be able to see where you got everything easily enough.
---
Im also interested
---
this 99.99999% of the time
---
I saw a run yesterday with runecloth reserved. That was new.
---
I spent 3 days running non-stop to see it drop twice, winning the 2nd time. Honestly just wait till you're 60 than rofltomp your way through Mara.
---
True
---
I didn’t pay for power leaving. I use a vpn at home... could that have flagged something in their end?
---
Haha... yes.... my alt... excellent advice.
---
Your mum's a meme spec.
---
Probably but I didn’t say you were stupid, just the idea of dos only joining groups and never making their own is stupid.
---
Actually ele shaman isnt that bad at the moment, since the raids are so easy its Actually over fast enough so you dont need to downrank spells.
---
Watch defcamp and meldorons latest video on youtube
---
Conversely I’m on Heartseeker every night and you can’t even vendor in Ironforge because it’s so laggy. This was always the case, even in 2005 - servers were constantly dying. The game never did. It’s literally the reason they came up with cross-realm BGs and LFG.
---
Assassins dagger. Blue and could be upgrade. Sells for 300g. Gonna need to sell and buy my blues.
---
That seems completely fair, reminds me of rushing in Diablo II.
---
Well for starters it didnt ask for your name or password or prompt you to log in did it?
---
I would first verify that it is indeed Blizzard contacting you.
---
Second (If it is), wait for one of their support team to contact you. They systems they use now a days are all automated. By requesting an appeal, an actual human going to be reviewing your claim.
---
Besides that, all you can do is wait really.
---
You can go earlier, but most guilds will want 60's.
---
Tons of groups have cleared MC with level 57+ toons.
---
Myriad Pro Bold
---
You can do stealth runs with 3 rogues. Takes about 5 minutes a a pop, instance locked in  30 minutes.
---
I've killed Anger around 100 times now, been lucky in the way that I've seen 4 HoJs but unlucky as I have yet to win one.
---
No way would I do 100 kills of actual runs.
---
I lost my shit. Thanks for making my day lmao
---
Painweaver edges out a second tribute ring if you're hit capped.
---
Exactly. I play girl characters because I love the way they look. Period. I do not play characters as an extension of myself. If I did that, I would play a guy character. But I do not RP, I play my toons as if I was playing as Lara Croft in Tomb Raider. I prefer the female aesthetics and that is that.
---
There are some weird mentalities being spread around the community lately that I never experienced back in Vanilla/BC.  
---
I tanked SM Lib on my latest alt a night ago and the final boss dropped his staff. It was a huge upgrade for our Druid healer but they rolled greed instead of need because they were about half a level short of being able to equip it, even though nobody else in the group could even make use of it. They said they'd been chewed out in the past for rolling need on things so I looked through all of their gear and it was all low level/green stuff.  
---
I ran Library again with them to make sure they got the staff. They're an amazing healer and have quickly become one of my favorite people to dungeon with.
---
That’s kind of rude. I just wanted to make a joke and not steal it from someone else :/
---
Yup, that would also have been a ninja!
---
Okay, let's work an example:
---
Let's say that you can easily buy an Apple for 1 dollar.
---
Now imagine that you could easily buy a piece of Meat for 1 dollar.
---
Great.
---
Now imagine that you (a vegetarian) and your friend (a carnivore) are working together and you both discover an Apple.  Which of you two should get it?
---
If the vegetarian were greedy, he might say "Well I can eat this Apple, so I should have it!"
---
If the vegetarian were honest, however, he would say "Well we both earned this Apple, and it's worth 1 dollar, which you can spend to buy a piece of Meat.  So since we can both use this Apple, we should each have an equal chance to get it, so let's roll for it."
---
And there you have it.
---
That's why it's fair for everybody to roll on BoE items.  They're worth the same to everybody, and everybody earned it, so it's fair for everybody to roll on them.
---
All you can do is appeal. Sometimes bans are withdrawn after a select period of time for whatever reason although it's not guaranteed. There's been some cases where these threads get enough traction to draw attention from mods at Blizz who then overturn the ban but it's rare. Most of the time they end up confirming the initial reason for the ban so these type of threads have lost credibility in the community.
---
He can’t afford it.
---
I believe ypu can pull equips. So just use that as the indicator? I know spy addon uses equips to determine players levels
---
Water breathing potions are definitely in Classic -- I'm using them for my farming.
---
well, yeah abuse can do that but i'm not talking about abuse.  it's more like humorous indifference - like "oh, you're so silly.  just as well i can live without you"
---
craft it and drop it for something else
---
Especially since the druid actually commented and he/she writes just like OP....
---
I guess I’ll just wait to see what the appeal says. I hope it wasn’t cause by me being connected to a vpn
---
Those nails.
---
My cousin does this and I love her for it honestly.
---
That’s a vague statement. So you equip every item you get as a drop? You never sell anything? Yeah I guess the items are meant to be equipped but that doesn’t mean they don’t hold value that can be converted into another item you need more.
---
Technically between today and December 31st, is sometime before the end of the year.
---
Answered.
---
But, additionally, you can go into the raid ID to find out what instances you are saved to and when their timer expires. I think it's...
---
- Click the 'O' button (not zero)
---
- in the new window, click the raid tab on the bottom
---
- Then there is a RaidInfo button at the top of the window and upon clicking that, you then get that info.
---
I'm curious what you're thinking with this statement.
---
I got all 4 items from Herod in 4 consecutive runs. That’s all my luck spent for at least 2 tiers.
---
Who has a problem with rolling need on upgrades? Especially those 3G blues lol
---
As a feral durid who tanked dmN regular run because I never tanked thier before. 
---
Never preforming a regular run again ESPECIALLY with a pug group
---
Gotta remember you're not building any threat in phase 2, so it's still possible for the ranged and healers to overtake you eventually if phase 2 lasts long enough...then ony is going straight for a healer or ranged in phase 3.  
---
According to the comments here though, as long as your main tank never takes a solo fireball, or a secondary fireball from someone else, he should be able to pick up aggro in phase 3 pretty easily.  
---
I'd also like to know if the secondary target of the fireballs takes all of the aggro reduction or of it's split between the 2 though.
---
I guess it would be from now until the end of the year.
---
Oh yeah for sure, but theres also a chance a range dps like a really geared warlock pulls insane threat while shes airborne. You cant really 100% do this fight smooth, theres gonna be bumps, id take the risk of pulling threat in P3 as a warrior and tanking the boss no problem over a clothie doing it.
---
There's now two Warden Staffs on my server, and I believe both can be had for 300g. Which, frankly, is still a lot in the current economy. I expect them to sit there a while, given the DM hammer's competitiveness. They'll probably drop a fair bit.
---
&gt;that is disarm spamming scarlet bastards
---
I use Silent Fang with weapon chain to tank most 5 mens
---
but I agree on the first part. If you factor in you're not farming DM:E during that time I feel like we should charge even more.
---
Found a wnb ape
---
What am I looking at?
---
I only think the boe as gold argument starts to hold weight with extremely valuable boes that are guaranteed to sell for like 100g+.
---
But even then I would open with need if it's something you need and see where it goes. With friends/guildies I'd expect it to go to someone who legit needs it.
---
Jeez, the better question would be "who isn't?"  But only when they're grouped.  Solo, alliance leave me (undead rogue) alone for the most part.  Human rogues MAYYYYBE, because they think they have something to prove but its amazing how many rogues don't know how to play their class.  
---
I played a NE rogue 15 years ago and thought the level mismatch ganking thing was a horde identity crisis.  Turns out, alliance does the same thing.
---
The money's probably better spend on buying bis blues every 10 levels. But if you literally have no issues dumping hundreds of gold on an alt, yeah crusader is the best thing to put on a weap right now, especially at those low levels
---
Lul I'd drop group and/spit if you tried to give me 50s
---
You know, when you said Sulfuras and druid I thought to myself "I wonder if its that druid named Forti I always run past in Feralas on my way to farm DME". And then at the end you confirmed it. 
---
I play alliance thankfully, but that druid is literally ALWAYS killing some poor warrior whenever i go by.
---
I don't remember if it's an Addon (I'm using a few) or, as u/TheSSshadow says, it's just a regular setting.
---
All you can do is appeal really. I'd suggest opening a ticket with a GM and press for answers. Sometimes it takes multiple tickets. There was a guy who posted a week or so ago who got banned for RMT. He was a multiboxer and would trade hundreds of gold between characters; all account and characters being linked to the same bnet account. He had to open 3 or 4 tickets before he pressed to speak with a GM supervisor, finally the supervisor actually looked through the logs and saw he was just trading hold between his accounts linked to same bnet account, but the automated system flagged him for RMT because it doesn't scan for different accounts linked to the same bnet account. He had his ban reversed but took him upwards of 6 or so hours of tickets and chats with GM's. 
---
Anyway, moral of the story time. If you are truly not guilty of RMT, account sharing, whatever; press the GMs even if it takes several tickets and escalating to supervisor level. The system can make mistakes.
---
Rogues also have a passive threat reduction, so they’d have to seriously outdo other classes DPS
---
A VPN shouldn't matter much, they will still have logs for everything you did in-game.
---
Great reply! I have a lv. 14 lock so i'll keep those in mind
---
Feral druid? You sure thats doable?
---
I’ll just wait out the appeal I guess. I’ll definitely update the thread here with a thing I find out. I certainly didn’t pay for gold or any other services.
---
Etiquette is not entirely utilitarian. This sub needs to stop acting like it is and should be.
---
So I totally meant to reply to the guy above you.....
---
Sounds nice and fair on paper but that will drastically reduce the BoE’s on the ah. People will need things that they normally would much prefer the gold over and would normally sell it. 
---
Also these are the types of player friendly QOL changes that ruined wow in the first place, so let’s not go that route please.
---
Ok cool. I guess I’ll have to just wait out the appeal. This sucks
---
Luckyboy I can see both sides of the story and from the outside, it seems your way is the fairest by everyone needing on BOE's that makes sense as everyone earned this gold sorry to the guy who it was a direct upgrade for.  JUST FOR CLARITY :::: I would only use this with random LFG's and make sure everyone is aware of the need/greed process before the instance. Otherwise, I'd do what OP was doing if I'm doing it with my mates or people who I trust.
---
The beer is on the tables
---
It's not the people that spam when their message gets pushed out, it's those that just straight out post their message 3-5 times below each other instantly. Why the channels have no spam protection is beyond me. LFG should have a max of 1 message every 30 seconds.
---
'Ruined' in my eyes.  To most people it's become more accessible and filled with more things to do.
---
I would have preferred to play the '07 version with no GE or trivialized easy mode content.
---
Skilling and maxing has gotten way easier over the years and the vast majority of the content they add is centered around PvE (PvM in RS) which has never been an engaging or fun part of the game for me to begin with.
---
Oh my bad on the assumption then bud. I've been tanking on a troll shaman which is fun, but damage mitigation is trash. so I try to make use of CC, but I always have a hunter or rogue breaking it Everytime.
---
Group with a friend, make them leader. Log out for approx 45sec. Friend resets dungeon when you log out. Log back in and you're back at the beginning with dungeon reset.
---
Yeah, that harpy cave. I can just imagine how that tauren hunter felt before our group showed up. He must have been severely in over his head :-o
---
- warlocks have a self-heal. 
---
- they don't need to be healed
---
- don't heal warlocks
---
Yeah, it's a shitty situation. Hope it all works out for you!
---
Yea I don’t even understand how I would have gotten flagged. I seriously only have like 120 gold and that’s all been made from selling drops on the AH
---
thank god ive been saying it for weeks. mages are everywhere, theyre toxic, they suck, meanwhile every hunter ive played with has been pretty good to excellent at their class.
---
Well yeah but no because then you're pulling aggro because you're dealing damage on top of healing people. Or say it goes fine and you don't pull aggro, great, you gained some time for the group. But now, oh no, you have to sit down and drink because the shitty amount of damage you did took all your mana bar because you're not a dps, you're a healer. You lose as much time as you gained, or more, and you've gotta drink away money if you don't have a mage.
---
So I guess just wand right ? That's the problem you have in the first place. You're just ~~wanking~~ wanding.
---
When you say inner mara, is that purp wing or orange wing?
---
https://youtu.be/6CNN_Cn2L2A 
---
It’s only one kill, but rogues seemed to outperform by a large margin on the world first KT kill. I don’t think it gets anymore endgame than that for warriors to finish “scaling”.
---
not that insane when undeaths are under 1g and waters are over 20g   
---
basically print money with that
---
What about my alt that can use it? I helped earn the item my alt should be able to use it. Who makes the decision I can’t roll need for him?
---
You're right, there wasn't much thought there
---
Totally agree with you. Now that it is the norm it has ruined end game for me and playing on my main is less appealing
---
Probably because it was not very accurate. My server feels very close to 50/50. I think there's a few more horde. But it showed alliance/horde at like 75/25. 
---
There were just not many horde using the add-on.
---
That will definitely be fine.
---
Know what would have been a GREAT LFG addon?
---
Not fucking up the re-release of a fourteen year old game that they already had patchfixes for and could have avoided exploits in with 10 minutes of googling.
---
Not Nice.
---
I never saw this reservation stuff back in vanilla. Retail dun corrupted the past.
---
Was running Scholo. One of those mini bosses before Gandling mind controls. Got our healer and ran him into melee range. What does the mage do? Frost Nova. Cone of Cold.  
---
FUCKING MAGES RRRREEEEEEE
---
It’s just a shame it comes down to RnG haha get some very unhappy people, especially later on 😂
---
If you equip right away by all means I have no issues at all whatsoever... You roll need on that... and congrats!
---
&gt;I'm not passing on a 300g krol blade just because some pug rogue will equip it.
---
Why though? So you can make some gold? For what? If the gold is for gear, then wouldn't it be better for you and everyone else to adopt this system? So you can just roll Need on the things you need, and greed on the things you can't immediately use?
---
There seems to be a thought that "if it's worth something, fuck everyone else"
---
What are the orbs on Stratholme?
---
&gt; A player intending to utilize an item trumps the intent to profit from an item. It's a similar argument to Main Spec &gt; Offspec premise
---
It does not. Maybe in some guild runs but those are not Pug rules.
---
So I guess that's the issue. There's no actual problem being solved here.
---
Again, if your view were correct, and using an item trumps profiting then there would not be any Bind on Equip items. There would be no need. Everything would be BoP and you would profit based on the vendor price.
---
There's no logical argument for 'x' player trumps 'y' player for a BoE item. Everyone has equal share. It's pure greed to think that you deserve an item that can be sold on the AH more than anyone else in the group. If you really needed it you would have bought it on the exchange already. What you really want is everyone to pay for your item.
---
I saw a "LF tank and healer for strat live, orbs and recipes reserved" the other day, i think they were spamming for several hours looking for some fools, dont think they ever found any.
---
As a 60 Mage who aoe farmed from lvl 22 to 60, farm Mara until 53 and then start joining BRD AoE prison runs(4 mage+priest). Nothing comes close.
---
I'm pretty sure tab sunder is recommended for dungeon tanking to get threat on aoe groups. Ive never heard someone tell people to keep spamming sunder after 5 stacks on bosses.
---
If you equip it, that person saves what the value of the item is in gold, from not having to purchase the item, which if they really do need/want it thats what they should do, (if you really need or want an epic boe, i wouldnt hold your breath waiting for it to drop).
---
Therefore it is still worth the gold value, even for the person equiping it.
---
We all understand your point. No one wants to do it that way cause it’s not fun.
---
Gonna be honest, if I had the recipe I would use the money from crafting to buy the recipe and stash it in my bank every time it appeared for sale.
---
If you don't try your hardest to kill teammates who get mind controlled in Strat/Scholo, you aren't playing the game right. I'll even waste a shard on shadowburn to seal the deal.
---
It's the spider trash before the spider boss I think?
---
Yeah he can do something else, like reserve the loot. Then everyone comes out of the dungeon happy.
---
Re-read your “apology” lol. You really do need a therapist if you don’t have one already.
---
I did the same. It'll get replaced with epics eventually
---
That's how guilds and DKP work, yeah.
---
Nobody does DKP for pugs, because the logistics are too hard.  But if the logistics were easy, I'm sure people would love that.   The whole point of DKP is that it helps make sure that people get loot once they've earned it.
---
Lmao you think anyone knew what they were doing 13 years ago? People were clueless as to even just basic dps rotations, which you can clearly see in the video you linked as well so it's irrelevant. The way people play and knowledge about the game have changed A LOT from back in the day. 
---
In addition, did you even watch the video? If you wanted to make a point then maybe you shouldn't pick a video where the warrior isn't even dpsing half the time while the rogues have a lot more uptime, and even then as I said it shows nothing
---
Ditto
---
Right?
---
You make the pho or you mean go out to get it?
---
I found that kid to be super awkward. Like he sounded like a 5 year old. I think it deserves a 3 hour remake
---
Oh god yes. It runs on my surface pro 3 with an i3 and no graphics card. Granted on low settings but perfectly viable for questing and 5 mans.
---
We have one in our raid. While a resto/enhancer could do a similar thing and the final enhance talents arent that valuable for raiddps, it doesn't hinder our progress at all.
---
The dude has pretty good gear and hit several high parses, while twisting like crazy. It's alright, but mathematically you could just bring another full melee dps instead.
---
It won't make or break your raid to bring an enhancer.
---
Why do people care bout mounts this much? Never understood. They All ride the same speed. There is 60 and 100 but ye
---
I'm talking about between pulls
---
Rofl another opinion that's extremely popular and most people in game agree with posed as unpopular. Nah man you are just like everyone else. No one is complaining exceot a small minority. You said it yourself. One guy out of 5 had an issue. Take a step back lol
---
A few toxic people ninjaing this way is not a good reason to throw out the whole need before greed system and not allow people to need upgrades. In my experience they have all equipped the item right away.
---
200g isn’t too crazy for HoJ. A guildie just hit 70 runs and hasn’t gotten his yet.
---
(X) doubt
---
How about a low level dungeon like SFK then where bis twink items can drop?
---
Keep Classic Classic.
---
That would be absolutely fair, and I've had that happen in vanilla way back when.
---
But most guilds don't do that because they have a DKP system.   Also, because they're a guild, they want the item to stay within the guild so that they can progress through later dungeons.
---
Hold on, my character needs to use the restroom before the next pull. Does anyone have an extra [Roll of Enchanted TP]?
---
Ok, see this is a reason!
---
Now you are correct, there's no easy way to tell if the person awarded the item will use it to buy their item. You could of course check up on them and rat them out to the server if they don't, same way we handle ninjas and other undesirables now. It would just take a bit more work.
---
But really we can lump all those people into a category of bad actors. Doesn't matter if their ninjas, people who leave when not given loot or people that wouldn't follow social norms and don't use their non-class BoE to get a class specific BoE.
---
And the thing is, I think my system actually cuts down on rewarding those people compared to yours.
---
If we consider that some people will abuse the system either way, either through trying to ninja loot or sell it for gold instead of other BoE's, we can kind of chart the likelihood of rewarding these "bad actors".
---
I can think of really 2 factors that come into play, resulting in 4 situations. Whether or not the class of the item is in the group, and whether or not there is a bad actor in the group. Ninjas and other bad actors are relatively rare, but for the thought experiment I figured they'd be about 4% of the population.(1 in every 5 groups.) The exact number isn't super important because the comparison between our systems is a ratio, so that number can change and the result wont change. For my thought experiment I **doubled** that number for my side, both to account for bias and because I'll admit that for people that are 300-400 gold away from an epic mount, the desire for that might cause additional bad acting. (the debate as to whether an epic mount is as valuable as a BiS BoE is a separate one that there's no need to get into) As you'll see, even doubling doesn't make much of a difference. (I do think there's other rules that could be correlated onto the system, like not needing if you already have a world Epic and others don't, etc that could cut down on this, but I want this to be substantially higher to illustrate a point)
---
I also figured about half the time the Epic won't match a class in the group. You could persuade me up or down on that, I'm just using it to keep the math simple. This one does change the end result somewhat, but it can never change it enough to flip the final conclusion.
---
[Here's the super awesome chart I made in 10000 hours in paint](https://imgur.com/a/ZfFfo0Z)
---
Items "wasted" simply means they ended up in the hands of bad actors. Either ninjas or people who sell for profit rather than their own items.
---
As you can see, your system, the current system, actually puts more items into the hands of bad actors than mine does. And not by a little bit, by a lot. In fact there need to be 4 times as many people misbehaving in my system to equal the number of illicitly gotten items in yours.
---
Now what mine doesn't do is offer an immediate way of recognizing and punishing those who do transgress, however with server transfers and eventual name changes, yours doesn't offer a lot in those areas either.
---
In the end, if your goal is to keep people from abusing the system, my system actually does a better job of it. (plus we wont have those weekly threads of "so and so ninja'd my pants!" that are so dumb)
---
Thank ya 😄
---
VPN's are disallowed.
---
Rare drops in strat live, used in recipes. They're worth around 25g each on my server
---
I am absolutely not a #nochanges guy
---
What's this passive threat reduction you're referring to?
---
Instant install. Thank you so much for this.
---
How do you not get distracted by the fidgeting avatars?
---
No one to tell us no
---
I figured you sounded too angry for that to be real.
---
I felt similar as a human paladin - especially since I knew my pre-bis included wearing a dress. Human males are way too ripped for that.
---
Also, and this was my primary reason: casting animations. Human females have some of my favorite casting animations; same reason I absolutely couldn't play male NE on my druid back in vanilla/TBC.
---
My mages/locks on the other hand? Gnome male all the way for that downright beautiful /train.
---
If you say so.
---
Troll regeneration!
---
Druids should hot themselves for aggro and heals before pulls, I like to be about half so I can regrowth rejuv, run in at 90% hp and gain free aoe threat while I Los. Hopefully a few spells land on me around the corner and the hots do even more.
---
Warriors, yeah. Ask for food and eat.
---
As for drinking, I'll often pull if the healer is drinking at 70% mana or mages are drinking at any mana. I'll pull the pack, build threat and you guys can finish drinking for 3 to 8 seconds and then blow everything up or start healing. If it's 1 or 2 mobs, I'll probably pull them back while a healer drinks at 20% mana. They'll die before I need a heal, you can finish drinking to full.
---
We were doing golemag with like 7 warriors and every single one forgot to Sunder. Everyone was confused why boss was dying so slowly.
---
&gt;If you 'need' a non-binding item then why didn't you buy it on the auction house before the run? 
---
You're either trolling, or you really don't understand how this game works. 
---
You don't have to buy all the RFK gear before going into RFK... That's ***WHY*** you go to RFK...
---
(and just in case it wasn't clear, this applies to all dungeons, you don't need to buy the gear that you intend to farm.)
---
I have literally never heard of them before this post, and I'm pretty sure I'm in the majority.
---
You're kind of touchy about this too eh? Did one of them turn down your application? lmao
---
My rules are that you just need to equip it before leaving the group. If thats not ok and people are ninjaing gear just to sell, that's not a group I'm trying to be in. Thankfully I get more say in this stuff as a tank.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12811/righteous-orb
---
Righteous orbs, they drop from the Scarlet Crusade mobs in Stratholme. They're used in a few high level enchants (notably the crusader enchant) and a few other recipes (again, notably the Truefaith Vestments).
---
When factoring you only have a 20% chance to get it... many people would choose need in that scenario when normally they’d prefer to sell it for gold. But know they probably won’t get it, so they will take what they can get. Can’t say I’d do it but plenty of people would without a doubt.
---
Well I can't tell you how to enjoy the game... But I disagree with you 100%
---
Honestly with how homogenous everything is, seems like an awesome trait
---
There are, by and large, many occasions in which equipment will drop in which no player needs it as an upgrade.  BoE status is ideal for such situations.
---
The argument is that "If you roll Need, then the item becomes bound to you; If you roll greed, the item remains unbound".  This allows someone who wishes to equip an item to have priority, while still allowing for greed rolls to exist for the purpose of financial gain.
---
It doesn't really solve the issue of MS&gt;OS, but that's another story.
---
I'm banking all my bg pots I make now that I have a mount. Once they go live should be worth a lot more.
---
I have a question about rotations on Hunters.
---
I recently got a weapon that's slower than 3 seconds (3.3s), which is the ideal according to guides, because it allows you to weave Aimed Shots in between auto shots.
---
Using timer addons, though, my aimed shot seems to be taking longer to fire than a single auto shot rotation, so I'm missing an auto shot every time.
---
The actual auto shot is 2.7s plus it seems 0.5s reloading, which pauses due to Aimed Shot being charged still.
---
Am I doing something wrong here?
---
Most players named their characters after characters from books and animes they like. Safe to say no one has an imagination.
---
I disagree, but okay.
---
Because your alt wasn't running the dungeon with the other person that needed the item...
---
Because it's an upgrade while leveling for a few hours. The dozens to hundreds of gold are worth MUCH more than that. You might be able to get your 40 mount with that one item!
---
The reason the price of these items is so high is because they're TWINK weapons, meaning someone is going to make a level 19 character and leave it level 19 FOREVER and give it that weapon.
---
The value of that weapon to the Twink person is astronomically higher than the value of a few levels until you get your next better quest reward.
---
Thanks for that hot take.
---
I’m just joking guys. These are the specs that typically get shit on. DPS warriors are the best, but with a lack of tanks, we really need the Shaman tanks to step up.
---
Totally believe it. I've even seen a few typos in quest and monster text. Missed periods, extra commas, etc. For instance, the rock elementals outside Dalaran in Arathi have a number of emotes that play as their health drops, and none of them have periods at the end.
---
Plenty of people do it my way, because it's fair and not greedy.  There are plenty of other threads where the hive-mind goes the other way.
---
Rich people, boe epics and high tier blues aren't for random people to use while leveling they're for people leveling alts who have money to throw around or twinks, 9 times out of 10 you could sell that epic and buy blues or even greens for a bigger overall stat upgrade than the epic would have given you.
---
It does depend on the value of the item of course, I doubt most people are going to care about a 10g blue you took and equipped, but equipping something like a sfk dagger is idiotic since you would gain far more from being able to have your mount early etc than the marginal stat increase that will be redundant in a few levels.
---
I kind of want to move in to UBRS and grind a Fel Striker with 5 man groups and reserve it if it drops.
---
I have no idea if people would recoil at this or if people would just laugh at me thinking it would ever drop.
---
We had dreamscythe bounce our tank into the hole last night with the flavor text "From way downtown!".
---
Don't dot raid bosses though unless you are specifically told to before the fight begins. Don't take up one of the 16 debuff slots with something that only adds a little damage.
---
All need on BoE epics and blues of any value has worked back in vanilla... and nobody is going to change that. People can’t see how every BoE has a value that can be exchanged for another BoE of value, and they complain and cry when they don’t get it handed to them because it’s “for their class”
---
Because you're bored and want to help some random lowbies? Because you want to farm gold? Because someone in the guild is looking for a group and you're trying to be helpful?
---
I'm sure there are other reasons that a non-selfish non-douchebag could think of. Which is why you didn't come up with any on your own.
---
Change the seduction part to look like this:
---
    [pet:succubus,mod:shift,@mouseover,exists][pet:succubus,mod:shift,harm] Seduction;
---
So the full thing would be:
---
    /Petattack
---
    /cast [pet:imp,mod:shift] Fire Shield; [pet:voidwalker,mod:shift] Sacrifice; [pet:succubus,mod:shift,@mouseover,exists][pet:succubus,mod:shift,harm] Seduction; [pet:felhunter,mod:shift] Spell Lock
---
Nah you can. Don't fall into the Sunken Cost fallacy... also don't become an altaholic! You'd be happier. :)
---
You've already hit past level 35, so you can just make it your Alchemist alt. :D
---
Though what are you not happy about?... Is it the healing and the performance of DPS?
---
&gt; Everyone gets an equal chance at equal value item.
---
Except the value is higher for the person who can actually use the thing.
---
Played another 3 hours or so tonight, still 46. But only a few bars from 47..
---
I've always been doing something, rather than being AFK. So it feels like I should be ahead of the curve, and maybe I am because Reddit probably isn't that representative of the average player. 60 by Christmas feels about right, I didn't expect so many people to rush to 60 I guess.
---
Everyone needs gold \s
---
Bro it's irrelevant, just likely he didn't want to roll against him for loot
---
He can also resolve his issue by not pugging cause fuck pugs.
---
Are you sure the email was from Blizzard?
---
So why are you here?
---
Appeal if you truly did nothing. Sometimes when an account is hacked it will do some nefarious stuff and get auto banned for rmt. Follow these steps: https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/14319
---
I especially recommend paying attention to resetting your e-mail passwords AFTER you have made sure your computer is free from keyloggers.
---
If you weren't compromised then just don't exchange in game goods for real world currency.
---
Sylvanas did us all a service. For the Dark Lady.
---
Added specs to main message now, I can try looking for a previous driver that might help? I don’t remember updating but maybe GeForce experience updated drivers without my knowing. Also no apps are running while WoW is up I only had wow and discord installed on this rig pretty much and now i have deleted discord hoping it would help
---
"because if I dont want to tank I shouldnt have to"  
---
Is my favorite response.
---
Our tank didn't even think about hole positioning during the Dreamscythe fight and got bounced into the hole. Then Dreamscythe taunted with "From way downtown!" in chat right before he splatted at the bottom.
---
Yup. It was. Logged into my battle.net account directly and saw the notification
---
Because if that rogue were to equip it he would be wasting 500g on an item he'll replace in less than 5 levels.
---
Stop buying gold
---
Real email or phishing attempt? Oh that brings back some memories lol
---
Gz
---
Didn’t buy gold but thanks
---
"Vanilla only, forever" is #nochanges lol
---
I wouldn’t, Americans and Frenchies have been dicks to each since other forever now, even longer if you are British.
---
But if you’re German, yeah, maybe then.
---
I knew there was Alliance favoritism among Blizz!
---
Man I’m just joking with this. You play how you want! Playing the “right way” usually is just the easy way, not the “best” way or most fun way.
---
Just bought this computer two months ago so I would hope it’s not having issues with heat. How do I check temps while I am in game? Tbh seems difficult with myself only having one monitor and when it freezes I can’t minimize game
---
As a rogue who tries to be friendly and not be a dick: :(
---
There are dozens of us!
---
If an expensive boe drops, I tell everyone to need it. I've never had issues with loot drama, communication is very effective.
---
That’s not throwing out the need/greed system. The priest needs the 300g EQUALLY as much as the warrior needs edgemasters that will sell for that much. The priest can convert that gold into an item he needs. The end result in the fucking same. They both have a chance at an upgrade. If the warrior loses, he can farm gold and buy the item if he actually needs it that badly. If the priest wins, he now doesn’t have to farm for an equivalent item that he bought using the edgemasters money. You can’t get any more fair that that. The value of loot is not an equal spread. Certain classes have many more valuable BoE’s drop than others. That’s not being very fair. But for wanting to be fair and give everyone a shot at an equal upgrade, people on my side are labeled greedy.
---
"Come around here often?"
---
Yeah it's grey at 300 skill.
---
Yes okay I know what you’re saying. But remember that there are a lot of players (outside of this subreddit) who just want to play the game low key and they don’t deserve to be blamed for making a good interned (although wrong) choice. HOWEVER, if someone is needing an item that a) user can’t wear or b) user already have, then we have an asshole. To me that’s a huge difference although I would be sitting without my bis gear either option.
---
I’ve appealed, from what I can tell the account wasn’t hacked, I have an authenticator set up and didn’t get a notification, I did not buy gold or pay for powerleveling, and no one else uses my account. The only thing I can think at this point is they flagged it since I was using nordvpn.
---
Good warlocks bring 2 stacks of bandages to every run.  Locks that dont selfheal at all are lazy
---
I disagree with fucking people out of the loot they've earned.
---
This is basic fairness 101.
---
We all need money. The item could help boost you or others towards mount money. There are more than enough bracers out there you could use to not have to use these. 
---
Equipping them, *even if you were alone*, was a mistake. Mostly for the reason that you’ll get better very soon. 
---
The only deviance from that is if you’re at or near 60 and those are “pre-raid BiS”. Otherwise, this is short-sighted. Any dungeon would have similar bracers for free.
---
Please tell me this is a simple scrape on the in game chat text that simply searches for keywords. Please tell me this is how you coded it. 
---
I’ve been psyching myself out on building addons because I feel like I don’t have the experience necessary to build something “professional”.
---
Has anyone verified that this is the new behavior?
---
No it’s real. I’ve appealed.
---
Nah fuck that. Ignore this guy.
---
Reserving is fine because it better to avoid those groups. I had someone reserve Baron rivendares mount spamming world chat. They got roasted for it.
---
Thought it was the opposite, where you start buying consumables when you can reliably clear a raid on farm (besides cheap ones/fire resistance)
---
I'll try to remember to post what it is when I get home tonight. But I've got an add-on that shows durations of your own dots on your target. Like the icon has a little circle thing with a number for the duration remaining.
---
Whatever it is it's a pretty standard add-on.
---
I dont tend to stare at them too much
---
And who says you get to make that decision?? I was there running the instance, I helped earn it. I can actually use it. What’s the difference if my alt was there or not? Like give me one actual good reason. So your saying I didn’t contribute to getting that BoE?
---
Here’s the solution. 
---
Shift click their name, and see what level they are. 
---
Problem solved.
---
Lmao I can’t believe this decision. Especially when it’s his second strike. 
---
At least it creates a heel.
---
rep the old blanchy server!!! a TY letter or if possible remember the name and once you are further along some gold. depending on his level maybe he'd like some cloth of some type.
---
When stacking spirit is a viable way of playing a mage!
---
Freezing trap has a diminishing return.
---
good, you failed to read my statement
---
Yeah I read that and just wut faced.
---
If there is 1-2 tanks being provided by the guild then head should go to the tanks.
---
&gt; youre just not going to do any damage and its lame
---
You mean that you aren't going to do an instant shadowbolt in the last 1-5 seconds of killing a mob and, instead, are getting a soul shard.  It really doesn't sound like a big deal to complain over.
---
When I want to lay in bed and play then I run WoW Classic on my 2015 MacBook Pro with an i5 and 8GB RAM just fine at the “Classic” setting.
---
You need to remember this is essentially a game from 2004.
---
If you need a BoE go buy it on the exchange nothing is stopping you. If you don't then you don't really need that item that badly and it's greed for you too.
---
You should treat any BoE drop as though you already have it, because you can if you choose to spend your resources there.
---
To be honest, a warlock should not be tapping more than 2 to 3 times during a reasonable pull. The only time a warlock should be tapping to 1% is after a particularly awful pull where people will be drinking anyway or during setup when they have to cast demon armor, Soul Stone, and hand out Health stones.
---
SoW plz.
---
*laughs in horde*
---
Got my 2nd Tarnished Elven ring last night with a winning roll of 9.  In these streets of Azeroth flexin on bitches!
---
This is not an unpopular opinion :)
---
Advanced graphics settings for dx11? Is that in game for classic wow? 
---
I can try the log change might post a follow up question later pretty sure I know how to get to where you suggested just a little fuzzy on how to turn the log to read only. Would I click the file and change it underneath properties setting?
---
until next century, actually!
---
(Its bis all of vanilla)
---
That's why you tank and reserve items, easy prebissing.
---
Correct. Just because something might look good on paper, doesn't mean it's good for the game forever.
---
&gt; Lfr is one of the stupidest ideas blizzard came up with. Raiding should be a reward for people who put work into the game, not something anybody with 3 hours /played at max can clear by auto attacking the boss while AFK.
---
Exactly. With great effort comes great reward. What is to push people into anything but LFR anymore? NOTHING.
---
Sap and gouge share a DR.
---
No, it’s inner
---
Is that not how people play?
---
How is this bullshit?
---
Saving this for later
---
Falador. There was nothing there, really. I feel it was just used so much for trading because varrock was full and they needed more space.
---
That's not an alliance, trolls are horde.
---
Fuck I’ve been offering 100
---
I get that, but in this case I really did not pay for any outside services or gold. I've filed the appeal and am just waiting to see what they say.
---
The value of the item is greater to the person using it. To a mage the sword represents an amount of gold, to the warrior the sword represent an amount of gold plus utility, effectively doubling its value. 
---
If a warrior has to buy gear, that money is lost for combat effectiveness. If a warrior wins gear, the value of the money is added to the combat effectiveness.
---
On the alliance side you can't turn it in if someone is doing the Onyxia attunement event in SW.
---
True, but they aren't really buying a service, just surrendering small chance to make a bit of gold. 
---
As for the amount of orbs your reserve. It kinda depends on the servers economy. Any pre bis geard warrior can solo SM Cath and make 25-30g an hour. So if the the orbs are only 25g each on the server like mine, if you only get one in a single run, you break even, sometimes you don't get any...it's still a risk.
---
I do this literally every group I form for rend with but I also explain it beforehand at least once. I've done over 70 rend runs for my god damned mainhand and I'll be damned if a rogue on his third run ninjas it from me.
---
My move is I will always ask the group if it's okay if I roll need, and I say I will equip. "Mind if I roll need and equip these? There a nice upgrade"
---
Gives the group the chance to veto you and makes your intentions clear. If you get significant push back and you really want the item you could even offer to pay everyone a few gold for it and roll need. 
---
I did this the other day in a group, 2 people responded "go for it", and one guy gave a slightly snarky "I mean, I guess" which wasn't a no.  So I went for it and all was good. If one guy was slightly miffed that's his problem.
---
/startattack
---
Its defs worth boosting Alchemy ASAP to transmute arcanites for the free 5g a day. 
---
edit: I know its a 48 hour cooldown but I'm averaging 10g profit per bar these past weeks. Minimum 5g maximum 16g.
---
I'm sorry to bother you with an unrelated question but, I'm confused by your comment. I have been leveling a prot Pally and I am now level 40. Everyone I talk to says they would rather not have a Pally tank in a raid but a warrior one (druids are out) because warriors have a taunt. I started leveling a warrior so I can tank endgame, is there a reason people don't want warriors either?
---
Why would you use that over Lionheart?
---
It is. But you never saw me say such thing
---
I stand with the tank when I do this and get an healer to pocket me.
---
I was decked out in bwl gear though.
---

I would respond with the opposite direction: "I'm not the one staring at a male cow's butt all day."
---
I watch a little anime -- just finished Gravity Falls! Which, I'm sure people super into anime would yell "That's not anime!"
---
&gt; Flying mounts for example do add fun
---
Once you get a flying mount you don't engage in the maps. You finish your quest in an area, then mount up and lift straight up, then fly. You avoid any conflicts with the environment. Moreover, you can skip most wpvp as a result.
---
I did this back in the day. Need to do it again.
---
Your guild was in the wrong. You let a non tank roll on the binding and then tell him he has to wait for the rest of it until main tanks get theirs. Any guild who gives a non tank the binding in the first place is a joke. He has a binding, why do you think he’ll have any problem finding another guild lol?...
---
Or you could just use death grips, plate gloves that make you immune to disarm.
---
Feralas as Alliance is pretty underrated. Was always able to get like 42-45 done there. A lot of grind quests which I always liked because it gave a chance at the distress beacon.
---
Maybe it’s because I’m a level 35 scrub who plays on a PvE RP server, but I haven’t seen anybody trying to reserve anything yet.
---
Is your argument actually that OSRS shows us what not to do, or is it "I want TBC, classic+ would get in the way of that"?
---
"You targetting at me bro?

Welcome to yesterday's post.
---
I'm not sure of any addons, but if it helps you can create new chat tabs that have only certain content in them.
---
For example I have three additional tabs:
---
- One for LFG which includes the major group searching channels  
---
- One for pure chat/whispers (e.g. direct contact/PM's)  
---
- One for party/group/raid/guild chat  
---
Just makes it easier to manage the spam and find what you want.
---
If an item is better for you and you cn equip it by all means roll need on it, otherwise some turd is just going to ninja loot it anyways.
---
Druids have a weird obsession with mages in my experience.  They go out of their way to grief em
---
Bingo Bongo.
---
the rogue and druid can just duo it themselves. i don't even know the priest is there because the priest wants to kill kromcrush, not do proper tribute.
---
It is if there are no MCed people in the melee group, killing your raid is not the correct play

+6 str, clear Hunter mail!
---
I lvled "alone" to 60 back in the days, I came back to do it all again now, but with friends this time as i knew it would be a lot more fun. All my friends quit classic early on, or is 60 and in raid gear already, so i didn't know what to do.
---
Luckily my older brother wanted to play aswell, and he is as casual as i am and have never lvled to 60 before, only to 30-40. And all i can say we're having a blast! We're lvling a warrior and shaman :) Too bad he's in the hospital atm so i have to wait for him, but i'm looking forward to continue our questing journey when he comes home!
---
Honestly, with all the hype around 'Twink Items Going Up In Phase 3', it's highly likely that both all the twinks-to-be have bought their items already while they're guarenteed to be cheap, and the extremely large amount of people stockpiling twink items is actually going to _reduce_ the price in P3 or at bare minimum keep it at the current low level.
---
&gt;If it's purely a pug then probably fair to need roll all boe's since they're essentially like gold dropping.  
---
&gt;Say a 300g boe item drops.  Anyone in the group could sell that item and buy an item they actually need.
---
So why doesn't everyone in the group split the cash then? The group already splits all the gold drops, why should this one be different?
---
Wow you seem fun /s
---
Tauren names are more often then not cow puns, and it's considered polite when referring to them in the third person to call them "cow".
---
Sadly, I often get called "Fat cow" for asspulling :/
---
Hunter weapon
---
So people who want the item so they can sell it AREN'T being selfish? If someone only wants gear so they can wear it,  wouldn't everyone who rolls need on any piece be being selfish?
---
I get what you're trying to say,  but it's just thinly veiled justification for being a ninja and denying a teammate an upgrade.
---
Not very great
---
I mean that's what Reddit is. Any big sub will regurgitate the same thing multiple times a month. Hell sometimes the main subs have the same exact thing reposted within 24 hours with comparable amounts of upvotes
---
Mai afterburner should have an overlay while I game to tell you temp
---
You’re wasting time listening to people telling you where to play. Just roll somewhere and stick with it.
---
Discord does cause issues with it's overlay but it's unrelated to you and your issue, obviously since you uninstalled.  
---
Drivers can certainly cause the issue and especially if it's a fresh release of something new. Nvidia def has drivers dating back to multiple older versions so I'd certainly try that cause it's simple enough.   
---
If issues continue I'd look into possible overheating which I saw someone mention.
---
&gt; If you need an item badly then you would have bought it before it dropped.
---
That's why I'm doing the dungeon that drops the gear I need.
---
Second Wind is not pre bis?
---
The only time I ever regret leveling as DW full fury spec is whenever I face a monster that's higher level than me lmao. As long as I keep them at or below my level, I actually don't miss too often. The thing I am jealous the most of of arms though is tactical mastery. Especially now I just hit level 36, so I can't really properly stance dance between berserker stance for whirlwind then maybe back to battle stance for rend/charge.
---
My buddy found [a post from almost a decade ago](https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/726876-Some-things-you-didn-t-know-about-WoW/page63) that details some of the other flavor text from Dreamscythe if you fall into the hole during the fight.
---
Yeah I don't know, I did it with guildies and it was super easy to coordinate.
---
You can just fly off if it is being camped.
---
This is why I always do emotes to the mob I'm killing. I feel like targeting people is like pointing a gun at them and they might get defensive.
---
In dungeons where humanoids flee at low health and pull other mobs use Curse of Recklessness. The more melee in the group the better this is too because it lowers armor of the target. It also increases attack power tho so if it does too much dps use rank 1 so you still get the anti-fleeing affect. 
---
Also you can offer to CC humanoids with seduce on your sucubus but usually that's not needed and sheep or sap are much more reliable CC. 
---
Curse of Agony is basically a waste on 99% of mobs in dungeons because it just takes too long.
---
So you believe that the value of a specific item is such that it is worth more to the people who cannot use it, and you are using that to justify every BoE item as being the same?
---
It's not. If it was they would have bought it on the exchange already. The value of the item is equal to the market value of the item.
---
If you tell me an item is worth 120g to you and I tell you there's one for 100g on the exchange and you don't immediately buy it then the item wasn't worth 120g to you.
---
When you are needing a BoE item that everyone else greeds on you are having your party pay for that item for you.
---
Horde or alliance?  Heartseeker is alliance heavy, but there seems to be a pretty robust horde side also.  I see nearly as many horde in STV as alliance.
---
That's how you think, that's not how everyone thinks, stop assuming everyone agrees with your line of thought.  I dont see how only needing items you can use dosent make sense. Back in the day it was common practice to state loot rules over BoE. You are trying to argue with me over a topic I am neutral on, players should join groups of other players with the same goals, that is all I am advocating for. I'm not trying to push my own loot philosophy on you like you are me.
---
Edit: Here I'll simplify what I am saying so anyone can understand 
---
If you dont agree with the group loot rules find a different group. If you want to avoid the drama of someone getting mad over the loot rules then MAKE SURE EVERYONE IS AWARE OF THE LOOT RULES BEFORE LOOT STARTS TO DROP.

Caps just for the emphisis.
---
Prot warrior here.
---
* Highest repair costs.
---
* Least efficient class/spec at solo farming.
---
* Weak against most classes in 1v1 WPVP.
---
* Highest raid consumable cost over the course of the game.
---
* Has no special gold farm (e.g. hunters soloing Tribute, mages AOE farming instances, etc).
---
TL;DR it has the highest gold upkeep out of any class and is by far the least efficient class at making money solo.
---
The market is gonna be soooo bluuuuuue
---
A lot of people don't see it the same way as you(which is what i totally agree with).
---
People see it more as, "an item has dropped that is worth gold. I have a right to that item so we roll on it"
---
When it should be seen as, "an item dropped that will be an upgrade for this person. he should take it and equip it"
---
BoEs are seen as gold, not an upgrade. In your post it was just a low level boe the yorgen bracers which probably isn't worth that much. But imagine if an item dropped that is worth 100g+, people don't care if it's an armor piece. To them, it's gold
---
Yes common sense limitations should apply on loot. It depends on gear, but a mage really shouldnt need a trinket that only provides mp5 regen.
---
i’ve even seen a lot of fury warriors recently in the 40s. not sure what’s up tbh
---
I was on my warrior running through barrens, a full group of 29/30's suddenly running to RFK come upon me. They immediately are /spamming/ in yell and it's clear they're pretty much yelling 'DRINK THEIR BLOOD, RED IS DEAD RAAAAAH' even fi I can't see what they are saying...
---
I almost didn't have the heart to put on my BRE and WW them. I was so proud of them.
---
Oh yeah for sure. I’m at about 185 on my 37 rogue. I need to get that ASAP
---
this isn't how math works
---
the gold value of the item decreases from AH value to vendor value upon equip, so at no point is the item worth both its combat utility and its AH value combined.
---
Feel like if you're too open you risk pissing off everyone else though right? Wouldn't you have a mutiny amongst your caster DPS if a healer won Ring of Spellpower?
---
Several guilds I Raided through naxx with kept one for lock dmg boost and mana returns for a healer group.
---

---
I too don't understand.
---
Reserving is perfectly fine, as long as it's done right. This is how I go about it:
---
1. Reserve only one item
---
2. Communicate the reservation clearly at all times, especially when advertising the run
---
3. Do a full or substantial run, so that bags of value is extracted from the excursion, regardless of the reservation
---
I make runs like this all the time, and they work great for everyone. Realise that many players looking for a group won't need the item on reserve. Such players have literally nothing to lose and everything to gain by joining, especially with multiple bosses and loot in play.
---
Just for the sake of argument though, let's say a player sees my group listing and needs the item I've reserved, you know what they generally do? They just don't join my group, and opt to join one of the many runs that fit their needs. It's literally that simple. 
---
Again, no one is being forced into or cheated out of anything here. It's a free market. You join the groups that suit your needs, and don't join the groups that don't suit you. If you don't see a group that suits you, then simply make your own and tailor it any way you like.
---
I don't care about your race or gender, I kill randomly. No one is safe.
---
Actually, I try to avoid fights. I'm a priest
---
It prob was from being connected to VPN I’ve seen people get banned for logging in out of county while on vacation or work
---
The point they are making is how during levelling and 60 dungeons you need lots of tanks. 1 in 5 per grp. Tanks are much harder to find than dps. So you get to / are forced to / are begged to tank most of the time. 
---
Where as raidgroups are often built up from tanks. You have maybe 3 core tanks and if you are not part of those then its real hard to find a tankspot in a raid as warrior. Real hard. 
---
But its not that people dont want warrior tanks. People definately prefer warrior tanks. So levelling a warrior, if the aim is to tank endgame, is the safe and wise decision. Gl with the warrior!
---
&gt; forming a group with mutual benefits
---
Kinda hard to do when there is a zero-sum outcome:  Multiple people want the same shiny, but only one can get it.
---
So you think it’s best to spec dps until higher levels then respec to more tank?
---
What I did was disable the Addon, move my unit frames, log out(don’t force close) and re-open up the character with it still disabled. Then go back to character screen and re-enable the Addon. It hasn’t reset for me since
---
Then that is dumb. Even the tool tip in vanilla. [https://i.imgur.com/gWnvZzd.png](https://i.imgur.com/gWnvZzd.png)
---
Your bags are full of shards, and if they're not then you need to go grind some because you don't get to go out into the world and have fun if you don't have shards.
---
You get whispers every day from random strangers, asking you to summon them. Oh and you're tasked with finding two additional random strangers who are willing to help out.
---
If you ever wipe in a dungeon there will usually be a query in party chat asking why there's no soulstone and at least one passive aggressive whisper asking for a soulstone. Guess what there's no soulstone because it's on cooldown, because we wiped earlier when that mage ran around in circles spamming arcane explosion without watching where he was going so... now we're all running back in fuming silence and that's that.
---
Should be, as I believe the resist chance scales off of purely the difference in levels?
---
PvE server but there are at least 3-4 quests that you do in an alliance only zone on an island so hopefully that's peaceful hehe
---
I’m starting to think it’s the vpn too.  But I did use us servers when I connected
---
There's nothing to disagree with. I explained why the system is the way that it is. You aren't going to change human behavior or overturn the principles of economics so you just have to live with it. Or get mad at not understanding it. Either way.
---
3 level 60s already???
---
Just one of those professions that doesn't generally see good profit until you pick up some high end/rare enchants. At least in what I've seen. Not a disadvantage, just wont make money like selling herbs and minerals, or flasks etc.
---
&gt; If it was they would have bought it on the exchange already
---
Why do you think people run dungeons after their quests are done? That's literally the definition of Grinding in this context.
---
This is posted literally every day now :\
---
I just do it because human females look nicer than male humans, idk just like the customizations more
---
Just go Roth 401k, 19k ez
---
Prot warrior with an arms set.. just in case.. one day. I even have BRE &gt;_&lt;
---
Shamans can't use wands.
---
I noticed this hard last night when I was doing the Ras Frostwhisper chain where you have to go to Arathi for a book.
---
Level 36-40 ogres we're hitting my prot war for like 3-500 damage a hit.
---
&gt; If a krol blade can be bought on the AH for 300 gold, the rogue can buy one for himself at any time
---
Unless they don't have that cash and that's why they're grinding that dungeon.
---
It doesn't solve any issues. It just forces a wrong mentality of what the purpose of Greed and Need are, that don't need fixing unless you apply incorrect logic to how they should be used.
---
You just turn 'need' into 'i need this more than you' which isn't actually a thing because the value of a BoE is the same for everyone by it's nature.
---
Also Light of Elune
---
I'm a healer but I've heard from warriors in game that the dps spec offers better threat generation than prot (at least early on). I don't think you'll cripple yourself trying to tank in a dps spec. It's not as big a deal in classic as it is in retail. I main a priest and healed as full shadow spec until lvl 52 when I switched to holy for BRD, and tbh I probably didn't need to be holy for it.
---
Hopefully a proper worry can come and give their insight but yeah, that's all I know! :P
---
What guild is this ? Why would he be blacklisted for leaving after you guys were dumb enough to give him half of a legendary and then tell him, jk bro you wont be able to finish it. Hopefully your guild gets the the other binding to drop and thats it. So you guys know how it feels to have a useless item take up a bag slot if its never finished. You guys should all go buy door knobs and use them as necklaces instead of attaching them to actual doors, pretty much the same thing here. Yea its not really good for a paladin unless he wants to cheese it in pvp. But the fact you let him get half and then say he will be blacklisted after leaving is crazy. Hopefully whoever your raid lead is responds to those fact blizzard whispers and gives up his account info.
---
Hmm yeah idk.  I’ve been reluctant to use my vpn while playing wow just for that reason.
---
But it doesn't have equal value.  It has the absolute value of being an upgrade to the person who can use it,  and a hypothetical value to everyone who wants to sell it for an indeterminate price and turn that gold into a potential upgrade at a later date. 
---
Need&gt;Greed.
---
Please think.
---
Reminds me of "Swan Princess", the animated movie
---
Very nice!
---
That seems... Really high. How much are the reagents?
---
Orc Shaman.
---
I follow the will of the wind. And the winds say drop the fuggin windfury totem. So i drops it. Always. 24/7.
---
Drinking before a pull? Windfury.
---
Mid fight and I feel like it might fade? Windfury.
---
Walking back out of the instance after finishing? Windfury.
---
Back At the inn after hearthing? Windfury.
---
I am a simple Shaman. I have mana? I can drop a Windfury totem.
---
Level as Fury/Arms, and carry a spare set of tanking gear (Maximizing Block, AR, STR/STM and defense), and do your solo leveling in DPS gear.
---
&gt;I don’t want to be a dps tank because people want tanks for Dungeons not dps warriors. 
---
Don't worry about your spec too much, you can even tank Onyxia just fine as Fury (We 23 manned it last week with a Fury MT warrior). 
---
Just make sure you have a good shield, and full plate (mail until 40) that maximizes survivability/threat and you'll be fine.
---
Thanks!!!
---
Is there a reason I can’t find a group for Sunken Temple? I can’t even see anyone LFG for it.
---
If you need you need. Thats how we roll.
---
German RP-PVP please!
---
Hey, at least your class reagent stacks.
---
Ninja logic at its finest lmao.
---
That's normal, it's how it worked even since launch in Vanilla.
---
Now you're taking about BoP gear. People here are discussing BoE (bind on equip). By definition BoE gear can be bought and sold on the auction house thus no need to go to any dungeons to obtain it.
---
Do you know the basics of loot in this game?
---
This is one reason I switched to Rogue, better threat management, I can keep dpsing while the wars have to auto attack or stop altogether. That and I don't like having to rely on others to be good in pvp.
---
Thunderfury warriors eventaulyl take care of that. Sadly :(
---
U can also farm the dogs in DM north
---
Idk why but I feel like that’s even more impressive than when I was playing my warrior in BC and went into MC just to clear it and got both bindings in 1 run.
---
But the way everyone in the thread is talking, it would seem like it would be unfair for all of that gold to go to one person, right? I worked for it too, so if an item worth 300g drops, and we all need it, I should get my 60g cut, right?
---
Otherwise it's exactly the same principle as someone needing it to use right away.
---
mana returns were not a thing until TBC. The shadow damage boost is nice though
---
dr?
---
Well I can tell you this, if I get my account back I will never be using the vpn again
---
Hunters and locks seem to be in short supply on fairbanks
---
tell your girlfriend to look up a good drain tanking guide and stop casting and spending gold to level drain mana.
---
They had faction/realm change during vanilla but not until the VERY end of the game, I imagine once Classic has been out for a few years and we're on the Naxx phase they'll release services, but not any time soon.
---
One question about Pet Training:
---
Does, for example, Greater Stamina 1 stack with Greater Stamina 2 if I skill both? Or should I just skill the highest one I can?
---
&gt; That would be true for BoP's, absolutely. 
---
So BOE's cant be an upgrade? Wut?
---
Orc dps warriors are often huge CHADS in real life
---
you.
---
Maybe he wants the Ogre Magi staff?
---
You pretty much have to be level 60 and you have to be vs'ing a melee class who crits you.
---
Darnassus was aleays... depressing.
---
Sonii offered to duel for the redemption matches. TIPS. PLEASEEEE make this happen!!
---
Well, I'll just move on and block you, obviously you can't actually hold a conversation without being a total prick. It might be splitting hairs to shunt potential ideas for "enhanced" WoW Classic to a separate sub, but it seems to be, again, mostly in-line with the general community preference here on this subreddit. You can talk about it all you like, just be ready to be downvoted for it.
---
Meanwhile, what is *absolutely* in the rules is to be civil and respectful (rule 2). And you're obviously completely incapable of doing that. Thus, I'll just put you on ignore and consequently be able to enjoy the sub without your inept chatter.
---
Boe blue go for it, purp everybody need.  Simple.
---
The end result is still the same, the rogue saves 300 gold that he would have spent in the future. What if all the other members of the group are also poor with less than 300 gold?
---
What do you expect? These people were miserable and lonely in vanilla and now they are 15 years lonelier and saltier.
---
He has a phone in each hand, and the left hand sent this to the right.
---
Can I transfer gold between realms? I got split on two servers with 2 different groups of friends at launch. I leveled my main to 60 on the server where everyone quit unfortunately. Ive got 300g and it would be nice if I could transfer that to the server im going to be playing on now.
---
I feel like playing dress up mentality is the minority by a long shot. And I would wager that in a poll that the majority of players would agree that it is strange for a male to role play as a female character.
---
I do not believe they will, best bet is to just stick it out maybe your friends will come back. Find some people in a guild to play with. You’ll manage. If they were to add faction changes then soon after would he other things like character boosts and name changes.
---
&gt;You're either trolling, or you really don't understand how this game works.  
---
&gt;You don't have to buy all the RFK gear before going into RFK... That's WHY you go to RFK...  
---
&gt;(and just in case it wasn't clear, this applies to all dungeons, you don't need to buy the gear that you intend to farm.)
---
This is what i typed, where does it mention BoP gear?
---
And yet it happens. But you havent answered whether you think it's acceptable or not
---
Because they love dealing with floating points, duh!
---
Well it is a philosophical argument. You and others who have commented on my post have said it is justified whereas I feel it isn't right and needing should only be done if it benefits the character you are playing.
---
We have been going back and forth over this for the past hour or two and nothing productive is coming from this.
---
I like it, but it would be a greater idea if Blizzard introduced their Dungeon Finder, but in this case without teleport to dungeon.
---
Lol,  don't get triggered so easy by someone asking you to see the reality of the situation outside of your greedy viewpoint. 
---
Consider that even the same value of an item isn't absolute.  Certainly there's a good estimate of what items are worth,  but it's not guaranteed.  Also consider that some people are simply better at playing the economy than others - the same item might be sold by each of the 4 party members for different amounts - because the value is hypothetical and fluctuates based on many factors, whereas the value to someone who can use it is much more defined.
---
Please consider the fact that you're not only wrong,  but using flawed logic to attempt to justify your greediness instead of just admitting that need&gt;greed.
---
In Hillisbrad, no less.
---
Nothing is toxic about imposing rules upfront.
---
My enh shammy friend was getting pressured into healing when he didn't want to in a similar way.  I was the tank so we just left and formed our own group.  Sometimes I would say I'm a dps warrior to try and get more cleave for his windfury totem.
---
Everyone needs money. That 150g worth of jordan could be put towards warden staff for someone else.
---
Everyone can use money for roughly the same thing.
---
I am not American don't swear at me like that!
---
Can we just sticky a fucking note to everyone to see when they log into the game.  
---
NEED WHAT YOU NEED. GREED THE REST. 
---
So fucking simple. Someone bitches me out I'll tell em to eat my asshole and ignore em.
---
I don't think you read what I said at all.
---
BoE's are an upgrade for everybody, regardless of the type of BoE that drops.   That's why everyone should roll on them.
---
So it has downvotes because others agree with me because its not an unpopular opinion?
---
And making fun of none specified people is always upvoted because its humor
---
Ask yourself, levelling to 60 take 100hrs of time, if I invested 100 hours into a guild how many people will I find that I like gaming with.  Think a faction change may not solve your issue, maybe I am wrong.
---
Paladins r the worst. Bc they can technically use all gear in the game they think they can roll on anything. I almost lost HoJ to an hpally even when he said he would not roll dps. Never trust h pallies or take screenshots of their intentions so if they ninja you can blast em and get them gkicked.
---
Hunter: Enjoy things now, your pet doesn't scale and it's all downhill from here.
---
Thing is. This wasn’t in a dungeon.
---
Edit: like, just fucking heal me and let me do my work, right?
---
They run dungeons for gear upgrades, "exceedingly rare" or not it's still a gear upgrade. You accuse others of "not understanding the basics" yet you can't even grasp the need/greed system or why the fuck people run dungeons lmao
---
But if they equip it, it becomes soulbound, so they lose the potential 300 gold from selling it, they only save 300 gold from not buying it.
---
It's similar to when mordhau came out. About 3 months without content and everyone loses their minds. I think wsg will come in p2 for the sake of pve servers.
---
More threat generation
---
It's not about dealing or compromising, I just expected more for Blizzard when it comes to game design and "giving me a purpose" in the game. 
---
If you need a mod to actually be able to play a game. Then that would indicate a flaw in the game design in my opinion. I understand exploration, but even that has some limit of what a person is willing to spend it's time on. 
---
And in any case, I would rather see exploration as rewarded with extra quests than a requirement to move forward in the game without the world leading you to it.
---
I get that unfortunately, in my case all I can do is hope they review the logs, all 120 of my gold came quests, kills, and the auction house, and my level 53 priest has been slow leveling, so I’m not sure how they would think i got power leveled. I really don’t understand if. I have nothing to hide and would love the chance to actually talk to a GM to see how this happened and get it cleared up
---
Er, no, we already knew everything about them being PvE and levelling gods, but straight up dishonest is how you said they do AMAZING boss DPS. They do okay boss DPS.
---
This is when being a tank pays off. Someone does that to me. I just walk away. They say sorry or Gg for them.
---
Hopefully phase 2 will be the shortest phase.
---
Been leveling a warrior dual wield so far and it isn't too bad. I'll probably switch over to two hand again when whirlwind axe is available.
---
That being said, when dual wielding as a warrior while leveling, should I use a dagger in my off-hand for higher attack speed to fish for overpower procs? Or should I just use the highest DPS weapon available?
---
All you had to do was pop an invulnerability pot
---
Post your macro so we can see what's wrong. I think what you're trying to accomplish is possible (able to use help mouseover while also targeting enemy)
---
Hey! My boyfriend and I are almost exactly like you guys! I’ve never played an MMORPG or really ANY game on a PC before. My boyfriend and I have known each other since wow was first released and since I didn’t have a PC he played with our other friends and knows the game quite well.  One thing notably different tho, is that when we he helped me get started, we leveled completely separately- he’s a gnome rogue and I’m a night elf Druid. I LOVE to explore and collect treasure, and he wanted to just get to max level ASAP. So now he’s level 60 with a ton of BIS gear and I’m level 36 with lots of gold (from selling too much loot I like to collect) and still have pretty shitty gear lol.  I attempted to stream when I started playing, bc I thought some people like you might enjoy seeing someone first reactions to the game- but I just got my first PC and had too many technical difficulties figuring it out... anyways, just wanted to say that your girlfriend and I are similar in our style of gameplay! And I’m really glad you were able to let go of your gaming ambitions to just enjoy the ride at slower pace! (:
---
if I take a tick i normal wait just 1 second before starting my jump spam again. usually lines up well with the tick timer.
---
Don't keep spamming jump if you've taken a tick, give it a second so you can get into the middle of the timer.
---
If it’s an upgrade then it’s an upgrade. He needs it. The rest of the group is crying over petty silver
---
If you have herbing you should make that in dreamfoil during the grind. It’s such a long grind.
---
I had a couple alts, but I'm 49 and the pace of leveling a Warrior is just mind-numbing. I don't know if I want to go through this again. On the other hand, I could have leveled like 3 mages to 60 in the same time period. On the other hand, once you hit 60 the game slows down a lot, so I might find time for an alt then.
---
I absolutely believe it. I've done the arena somewhere in the ballpark of 30 times (as part of full or partial BRD runs) and have never even seen Gorosh the Dervish spawn.
---
You kidding me!? I'd quit if I had to run a dungeon 90 times in 3 days, no game is worth that to me, plenty of other shit to play.
---
They won't do anything about traditional ninja looting where some needs on something that everyone is expecting greed rolls.  But changing the loot rules mid run can be punished.
---
Okay but I wasn’t commenting on that. I was saying that the explanation made sense.
---
Armoursmithing or Weaponsmithing? What's the concensus?
---
........... wat I'm guessing troll at this point.
---
Edit: nvm I understand just took a minute to figure out what you were talking about. If the lead didnt state the rules it's his fault, I never disagreed with you.
---
No more than you are.
---
Needing something just because you can sell it is greed pure and simple. Greed for gold, need to use.
---
Yeah, it's clearly a bug.
---
BS. Fury warriors suck in MC during phase 1. It's always rogues, hunters and mages in the top of the dps meter.
---
Not to mention, way back then we were all playing at like 800x600 or maybe 1024x768 or whatever. Much different than modern resolutions.
---
The moment someone can post 4 runs in 1 hour instead of 1 run in 12 mins will be the best method to copy. This one took about 3-4 gambles that don't work out usually.
---
Been playing since vanilla. And what "basics" are you talking about? How to ninja loot from someone who can use an item? How to be greedy in a way that is both shitty and sad? How to ruin someone's whole week because they only play a couple hours a day and have been grinding for a month for an item?
---
I hear Faerlina is a good server.
---
147 Angerforge Kills before I saw HoJ drop. I’m almost 220 arena clears without seeing the chest off Gorosh, seen Gorosh only 11 times to date.
---
that sucks, but i've had the opposite experience, my RL friends are slowly subbing now that the game's been out a couple months
---
Right, but it's redundant to have more is all I meant.
---
You mock, but this 2+ year plan could be condensed to 1 year or so, if the money is there.
---
I think it’s the opposite, we’re all stuck with families now, 10/10 would make this joke to my wife, but I can’t get her to play :(
---
Maybe a more apt observation, we haven’t had the experience of having a gf... in many years.
---
I personally won’t mind if BGs come out in phase 2. I am more concerned about slow release of raids than slow release of the honor system. Once the honor system is live, having BGs our is most a huge deal. 
---
With that said, I won’t mind if they release BGs slowly either. Classic WoW is not something I want to rush through. I will play more alts. Experience the game through multiple classes. And enjoy some time away from the game. I don’t need content to keep me playing 5 hours a day 7 days a week. I need enough content to keep me playing 10-20 hours a week. 
---
Yes, hardcore gamers will burn through content in classic. And for them, a faster release may make sense in the short term. But Classic has a limited lifespan. It has 6 phases. Do we really want to rush through those phases? What will we do after? Classic plus? TBC? Quit? I personally want to enjoy these 6 phases and not worry about what comes after for now. So rushing to later phases doesn’t make a lot of sense to me.
---
Imagine caring so much about other people's predictions for a 15 year old video game that you have to pretend they're delusional
---
Original EverQuest.
---
It has become a more active and fluid choice between defense and threat, because we’ve learned that it is possible to produce higher amounts of threat than the old school max mitigation deep prot builds. You swap to sword’n’board when you need mitigation, like after taking a crushing blow or crit (unless you’ve got enough health to survive another crush/crit) and stay in the defense until you’re at full health, then go back on the offense, sacrificing mitigation for more threat
---
in pure theoryland, for PUGs, it would seem to be fairest to allow each item to be auctioned between the group members (highest bid* gets paid from winner and split to other 4)
---
this way each item goes to the player who valuates it highest, and system works consistently for BoEs and BoPs
---
obviously runs into practical problems since some players may not have the liquidity to bid what they value the item at, but was an interesting thought experiment for me
---
*maybe 2nd highest bid is fairest way to do it
---
Imagine playing wow with no friends. Lol
---
Correct, so the value is (Gold saved + Item worth) what about this is not obvious?
---
The greedy viewpoint is one in which you believe you deserve an item of equal value more than the other people who earned it.
---
I'm not triggered but you seem to be. This isn't a battle you can ever win. We're not having a debate because I don't have any problem. I'm trying to help you avoid problems for yourself in the future.
---
Yeah I have made about four times as much money as my warrior pal cause he went alchemy instead of mining or skinning
---
After Classic TBC and Classic WotLK I believe there is a solid chance for Classic+ instead of Classic Cata.
---
:)))
---
Wait who actually disagrees to this. This is consensus
---
Honestly both are quite underwhelming unless you get some really rare recipes, and most of those come from top end instances/raids.
---
If you are in a guild that is raiding or planning to raid, I think it would be best to ask them what the guild needs, otherwise just choose whatever you feel suits you better.
---
That's how it was changed to work in a later patch but not for several years if I recall.
---
I’ll level for you. You’ll be 60 in 3 days.
---
That’s why you don’t immediately roll greed, especially for a BOE epic. Your fault not not partys
---
))))
---
They personally investigate accounts before they ban.
---
Also wasn't someone called out by a GM here for lieing lol
---
You can find which symbols get translated to which on the other faction and just make a sentence that way
---
This is so true. 
---
I'm actually in a somewhat smaller guild that hasn't started guild raids yet due to wanting to give time to most of the "casual" players to level to 60. Guild raids should start in the next couple weeks since most are now there, but we lost a lot of people early on because they rushed to 60 and were like "I need to get into raids NOW! Bye." 
---
I'm sitting over here at 60 since week 2, leveling alts, helping guildies, having fun and knowing we have another 4-5 months before any new raid is out, and even when BWL is out it is still common to clear MC. Lots of people trying to rush this shit and there is really no point to.
---
Shadowfang sells for 200g on my server. Everyone is rolling need on that.
---
I'm still just here wondering what people really expected of classic.
---
I have a 60 on the biggest server and on a smaller one. 
---
No one at all reserves anything on the smaller server, I find myself maining my 60 on the smaller server.
---
Such a better experience over all
---
They do BoEs so that you don't get stuck getting a useless drop off a trash mob and to make it so that people as a whole can gear more easily. Not sure where your asinine leap in logic that it's ONLY for monetary gain comes in lmao
---
I NEED gold, like evryone else. Let me ask you what do you do when an orb drops in strat live?
---
Unpopular opinion: using the phrase unpopular opinion is almost never putting forth an unpopular opinion.
---
I went into that at 54 and even though I told my group it was my first time I felt really bad for making a bunch of mistakes and having them carry me.  If we didn't have a 60 priest and a mage that could Frost Nova everything we would've never made it anywhere.
---
The rain animation is so rubbish. Needs to go
---
You can tank in arms and fury for all the end game dungeons easily
---
Very good stuff. Jotting that down for later
---
Certain sets of letters translate into “understandable language” that players of the other faction can understand.
---
No wonder I saw a group pissed a Spell Power Hunter needed and won it. They were going berserk in LFG about them.
---
Only the highest lvl counts. You can skip levels while training.
---
So the specific context you have in your mind in no way resembles this OP at all.

---
I think it's in their best interest to release at least WSG before BWL goes live.
---
I mean...it's why I posted here. Everyone is saying it doesn't apply to everything whereas I'm questing on my alt and it most certainly does.
---
Thanks for your input. A lot of commentors are saying the same thing you are: dont bother buying gear. Guess I'll just ride with what I got.
---
About to ding 50...hoping to get there mid Nov
---
&gt;Is there a reason I can’t find a group for Sunken Temple?
---
People hate doing Sunken Temple, it's arguably the least desirable instance and finding a group for it is really hard.
---
Most people will go in there once to complete quests or try for an item, and never go back again.
---
Yup there’s a big chance that BGs will come during phase 2. Not right at the start but somewhere in the middle.
---
I have leveled as Arms up to 55, and tanked everything this way. I only used my 2h weapon to tank when i was roughly 5 levels higher than the dungeon (helping friends, or farming SM, etc). Other times I would use sword + shield. I tanked a BRD at 55 the other day with my tanking gear and arms talents. It ain't bad at all and definitely doable.  Just make sure you have the stats from your tanking gear and let your healer know if you are having some anxieties about it until you get your footing.
---
The scenario you're describing is also one of the hypothetical outcomes you realize? Both the one you described and the one I described happen in game, so its completely pointless to make that distinction
---
How do you even define "absolute value" as opposed to "hypothetical value" in this scenario anyway?
---
When you see the leader of the PUG run is saying like "All loot is MS &gt; OS, (insert best DPS weapon here for fury warriors and rogues) on reserve!" Like who wants to join this group when you take the best items and just say I get it no matter what.
---
This has to be against TOS right?
---
How original
---
You're wrong. The value at that point is only [Gold saved] since the item can no longer be sold for [Item worth]
---
Im a full preraid bis fury warr and the solution is just tanking and forming your own groups. Ppl who complain abt it are so annoying lol. Its usually rogues that complain imo bc they offer nothing to the group, no buffs, res, and Ive even seen some refuse to open locked chests and say its my lockpicking my chest lmao
---
I left a guild because of this.
---
Yeah, I'm not struggling, just wanted to speed up my progress through gear if possible, but I guess the consensus is to just go with what I got.
---
most of it has come from just doing things TBH i have not done anything specific. i had ~1520 when i purchased my epic mount, the 250 or so ive made since then has been from farming BRD and not getting HOJ and then crafting things for people (devilsaur/Hide of the Wild) and selling anything i dont need
---
have not gotten a significant BOE/auction item in a while
---
Pickpocket bed runs can be profitable
---
Honestly just watch threat meter. The first 10 seconds chill out a bit especially if you crit. Make sure you're under 60% because a fat crit can rip aggro. DPS super slow on stuff like Baron Geddon where tank isn't on boss 100%.
---
One cool trick you can do to space out your damage and smooth out your health loss for sustain is to start life tapping after every shadowbolt when you are below 50% mana. Bolt tap bolt tap, this will slow down your damage but help your sustain and make you more manageable for healers.
---
Lucky you. On my server tank items have stayed very high priced. Anything BOE that is on the Pre-Raid BiS lists for tanks always sells for a lot.
---
He’s hoping someone else will validate his comment so he can feel like he accomplished something that no one cares about
---
You're vastly overestimating the impact that's going to have.
---
Everyone says to need BOE rares.
---
I will 100% keep this thread updated with any additions information I find. And if a GM wants to contact me or even do a public investigation I welcome it. I would love for the community to see why my account is flagged so they can avoid doing the same or so we can help blizzard  tune their review process.
---
Oh okay seems totally worth it then!
---
An item being reserved will only ever make a group go south if the reservation wasn't clearly communicated while the run was being advertised. If it gets communicated clearly, then it's extremely unlikely to cause drama.
---
In my experience, the vast majority of reserved item groups communicate their intentions just fine, and the runs consequently go fine. Sorry but either you got extremely unlucky with the groups you got, or you rolled on an especially toxic server. Either way, items being reserved isn't the root of the problem.
---
As everyone will say: sweeping strikes and cleave/ww combo. You can tank with 2h till lvl 50 and it's actually really fun to do.
---
I'm a rogue and my friends are a warlock and a warrior. We are all around level 20. The warrior is having a bit of trouble holding aggro. He found that he likes 1h and shield more than a 2h, any recommended talent builds or general tips for him? I heard that going prot wasn't a good idea while leveling.
---
Look at your chat log.
---
To me, gear upgrades &gt; money upgrades. 
---
 Literally the same argument can be said for BOP too.. Everyone can benefit from a BOP because its worth vendor money. YAYY everyone needs. 
---
That's just how i play, a gear upgrade for you is worth more than some gold in the AH. especially in the case of the OP where its literally a set of 5g bracers
---
 I'm wondering about it, which race should be better? I see many that say Gnomes because of the small target and the harmful remove, but i don't really like them, can you help me with this?
---
No, what makes you think that?
---
&gt;  I personally like it better without flying, but I can recognize that's a personal opinion and it didn't ruin the game.
---
For me, I just fondly remember some of the floating zones that required it. Was creative and broke up the doldrums at times. But as a mage in classic to be fair I barely traverse any ground so maybe just a preference. Once you reach max level its mostly city/raid hopping haha.
---
Also known as collect on delivery.
---
Totally stuck in my head now and I've got no problem with that....as the Tribe flies high like a dove.
---
I'm not arguing how good MoT is for tanking. I'm in agreement that MoT is the best tanking trinket for a Druid, forever at least for mitigation. But by no means is it a requirement to tank either. 
---
BHB, while not BiS forever on paper, is just about BiS forever to a feral Druid.  Finding a guild where you'll get a Drake Fang Talisman or Naxx Trinkets as a feral DPS are VERY slim and those are what replace BHB.
---
Want to raid tank as Bear? Get MoT.
---
Want to PvP rank grind as feral? Get BHB.
---
Want to raid DPS as feral? Get BHB and you can still bear tank on the side in 5 man dungeons.
---
Never going to go feral or bear and boomkin for life? Get 2% crit trinket.
---
Choices you get to make. Not some guy on the internet telling you what to do.
---
The point is to get geared before bwl is out so you're not still mostly in dungeon blues
---
42 atm, going slow and steady. Learning to appreciate those longer sessions of levelling!
---
Actually, before I did reserve runs my groups ended up being 3 clothes competing for the belt. Now that I reserve, its usually 2 clothies and a hunter, rogue, feral Druid, or maybe war who just wants the chest. Before reserving I wouldn’t of even invited those guys for the risk of competition if I knew the run would go just as smooth otherwise. Trying to be efficient with my time.
---
But you just argued BoEs exist so people don't get screwed from useless drops. Yet they do all the time from BoPs. If this was true why didn't they make ALL items BoE?
---
Because they didn't make BoE items so people won't get screwed on drops. They made BoE items so you can trade them freely for... money.
---
Next time try to have an actual argument instead of getting mad and trying to insult me due to your own ignorance.
---
I was being sarcastic lol
---
who?
---
And your party are a jerk because they actually discussed it instead of insta rolling greed then complaining on reddit?
---
LMFAO!!! I play OSRS and Rust wow what a coincidence!! Except in OSRS when you die, you lose your stuff and hats that. It’s not griefing in the slightest and even then you’re allowed to choose when you’re willing to do 1v1 or not via the multi-combat zones. Wow!!
---
Or rust, where you can pick servers to be trio servers or solo only so that you’re aren’t massively outnumbered any time you go to chop a tree? Wow!!!! Lmfao!!!!
---
You don't have to pretend or imagine. The Classic Beta, which had all content wiped at the end, was popular for months. Most people didn't get access to it either.
---
So yes, unironically claiming that the full release would be dead in a week is delusional. Especially when the average max level time is more than a week.
---
Is this still in violation of the tos? Communicating with enemy faction.
---
Can someone tell me what armor set that is?
---
That's not the point. No one in the party could use wands, but the hunter needed on it because he wanted it for the enchanting materials.
---
There are areas that require over 400 fishing skill in order to successfully catch fish,  including an event in ZG when that releases
---
Your logic is flawed and you’re actually stupid if you equip Staff of Jordan instead of selling it. The 44 staff from ZF is equally good.
---
You can fly to the PvP objectives in Outlands and take them without dismounting. The only way you could be forced into PvP was if a rogue or druid stealthed up and opened on you in order to get you dismounted. Even that didn't work in Terokkar Forest. You could sit on top of those Auchindoun towers safely on your flying mount and no one can sneak up on you. If someone flies up to fight you can always just fly away to find a new tower to cap.
---
Which is exactly what I would do before reserving.
---
Once people start complaining about being camped at flight paths
---
What's the name?
---
&gt; The objective argument is that to some players, an item has a monetary exchange value, to other players, an item has a practical usage value.
---
There's no such thing as this. Objectively.
---
If you aren't willing to pay 100g for the item on the exchange, then it cannot, by definition, have more than 100g 'practical' value to you.
---
Objective means this is a law of reality. Not an opinion but an economic fact.
---
Based on this objective fact you should subjectively choose to not pass BoE items based on the idea that someone needs it more than you. Because they don't. Unless you want to be nice.
---
So if you're determined to work with the made up scenario in your head,  what if h y p o t h e t I c a l l y we both intend to sell the item,  but I use the gold for a BiS items,  and you use it to buy mats instead of taking the time to farm them,  is the value still absolute? 
---
What if, h y p o t h e t I c a l l y, I know if a buyer on the server who is paying above market value for the item,  whereas you sell it on the AH for its average price, so I turn the item into much more gold than you would have,  are those values the same?
---
This is why hypotheticals are reliable arguments. Because you can " BuT wHaT iF..." any argument to death. 
---
Need&gt;greed.
---
Character name checks out.
---
I’m with you man.  Had an epic level 40 dagger drop in ZF the other day, and the group all agreed they must need on it with the rogue, who had fairly shit gear for his level and the shiny was a very clear upgrade. I was pissed, no matter what it was “worth”. I ended up rolling need with them with the intention of giving it to the rogue (to improve his chance of not getting robbed), but luckily he won the roll, and he immediately equipped (he hadn’t said a word to anyone mind you). 
---
You were in the right. It’s only a game, let people get gear if they will use it. There are many ways to get gold, but lucky gear drops are exceedingly rare.
---
Love how you had the orc lock put on a hood, that's some commitment.
---
I would just be looking it up for you and quoting the wiki for a full answer, but yeah you need over 300 to fish certain things.
---
That god damn holy power
---
Apologies for the UI, i do a lot of AH flipping so its a hot mess to look at :\^)
---
Yep and all these "serious" raiding guild who have been clearing MC/Ony every reset are already getting their players to that point. Enjoy the next 4-5 months I guess?
---
Edit: also BWL isn't a huge step up in difficulty from MC and can easily be done in dungeon blues for most players. For a few key roles it is important to have some gear, but in general it's really not hard.
---
Fury warriors carry raids once they start getting bwl/aq40 gear.
---
It is common for vanish to bug out like that (coming from another rogue who is pickpocket farming in BRD). The best odds you have for it to work is to get it off instantly. It seems like once you have 5-6 mobs attacking you the failure rate increases.
---
Huge thanks for the attention to detail on this.  If I see you on Whitemane I'll /salute you instead of cheapshotting you.  :-)
---
\-Snide (Undead)
---
You're thinking of server change. https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Faction_Change_service
---
Need if you need it, I never think twice if I can get an upgrade even if its a boe
---
Hope not.
---
No that's not true - it says groups of creatures that commit to combat as a group. This means even if they're 20 yards apart those two creatures would commit to combat when one is attacked. The bugfix now makes it so that if you continue to attack one BOTH will follow. It's not for random mobs aggroing off each other.
---
But it’s every two days If I’m not mistaken?
---
The attraction to gear is one of the most deplorable things about the game.
---
If they actually saw he rolled greed and decided to all roll need, they are jerks.
---
Loli think the same way but my guild sees it as exclusive which I don’t get. When I was farming for savage glad chain on my warr I questioned our GL and asked him why he thinks its a good idea to bring 3 people who need essentially a 1-2% drop. Make 3 runs and everyone else will get geared quickly
---
Ironic that I feel needing is the greedy option even if I need the item.
---
That’s what I’m getting at. P3 will reduce the dedicated groups purely to farm alliance. It will still exist but BGs will be the way people farm honor, and allows the disadvantaged team an actual shot at honor farm as well as opposed to just being camped while severely outnumbered.
---
That do good damage right now, because the 10% hit from talents really helps. Unfortunately, later on when the other classes get better gear shadow starts falling off.
---
If you aren't 60 by christmas you probably won't ever reach 60.
---
I’m level 45 too :p
---
&gt; And for the umpteenth time, the value is not equal, that's just bad logic and terrible justification.
---
I've already proven multiple times that it is. You keep asserting it's not without any actual argument. I won't continue to waste my time with you. I'm not your teacher.
---
If you have a soulbound edgemaster's, you're wearing them. I'd recognize that before the others dropped.
---
The proc generates a lot of threat though, which is an issue when you start talking about BiS gear.
---
Dumb
---
I might be wrong but I think it generates threat from the damage and the heals. I've noticed pulling agro from the mobs I am not DHing sometimes. Also, have pulled threat from mobs while bandaging myself... That being said. yell at her for using DM
---
If you need it you roll need.  Last night the  Myrmidon's Signet dropped in Stratholme for my five man.  That's a purple BoE world drop.  The three classes who could use it all rolled need, including myself.  A warrior won it and we all Gratz'd him.  If you need a BoE blue or Purple, roll NEED.  Unless there is an agreed upon loot policy at the beginning of the dungeon then it's Need on any item BoE item you can use and is an upgrade.
---
If you thought you leveled slow before you're in for a world of hurt.
---
Must have never player runescape when you were younger. They let that game get so bad that to this day, most of the player base is still a bot..
---
I played private servers and watched mage bots farm levels/mobs in nice routes for days as well. From what I hear it’s almost impossible to detect if scripted right.
---
Greed like everyone else in my group.
---
Like I said bop items can be turned into gold too so should everyone need on everything that drops because we all need gold?
---
As a druid healer, i encourage life tapping because heal over time effects turn overhealing into damage. That and i cant wand to helo with dps...
---

Playing a female character is not roleplaying one.

Unpopular opinion: Putting unpopular opinion in front of a post is a way to state an extremely popular opinion and have tons of people circlejerk with you in a way that gives them the validation that they're fighting for something noble in a contentious environment.  
---
This is not a contentious point. Your opinion isn't unpopular. Prefacing an opinion with saying it's unpopular is the most obnoxious circlejerk tactic on this website
---
I believe the rare catches are just % based locked in. Azshara has some pools that require 400+ to not lose your catch.
---
You are exactly right. If I need every BOP in a dungeon, I can go buy a BOE item from the AH with all the vendor gold. It's fair and just.
---
If it's boe that is in demand and readily available on the market it is not an item. It is gold.
---
Better for what?
---
You go to a dungeon expecting a specific BOP that drops from the bosses. Noone runs a given dungeon with the expectation of a given boe. If you want that boe, go farm gold and buy it.
---
Are you unemployed or student?
---
Okay dude, go aggro a mob next to another mob in the open world and try to peel it. You can't anymore as of this hotfix. I'm not talking about some group of things like the Crimson Courier or whatever, I'm talking about random Murlocs next to other Murlocs...
---
People blame the streamers for Dire Maul releasing early all the time, but I’ve never seen a single clip of any of them complaining, saying they are bored, and that anything should come early.
---
I barely even watch any wow streamers, but the few times I had all they’ve said is how much they have loved classic and how much they have to do.
---
Pretty sure this was just blizzards decision to keep people playing, not a result of anyone complaining.
---
Yes, there are fish that can't be caught unless you have 375 fishing (400 in an event) and the chance certain fish gets away is nonzero all the way to 450 fishing.
---
Just out of curiosity, what's making you not enjoy rogue at 60 and what made you decide to switch to Hunter?
---
Enjoy giving that guy your gold for no raisin
---
Are you more of a jerk if you ninja loot or if you roll need to prevent a ninja loot
---
I'm convinced Blizz themselves make these posts every once and while to scare the majority away from RMT
---
Let's trade some goods. NAFTA 4 lyfe! :P
---
You've proven nothing except your inability to expand your thinking beyond your narrow,  greedy,  viewpoint. 
---
Do you disagree that need&gt;greed?
---
You are doing better than me!
---
They will tell you "We reviewed your case, but we still think you are guilty". You will ask "What did I even do?", to which they always respond "We can't disclose that to you". And that'll be that. Innocent or not, you should get a new account asap.
---
I get this logic for higher level stuff. But this dude was running RFK. Like people are really gonna throw a fit over some level 26 bracers?
---
How geared do you need to be as a hunter to do solo Mara farm runs? I’m levelling a hunter for the enjoyment of it but at max just plan to do dungeons and farm Mara, so no raid gear.
---
Also is a wind serpent best for Mara farm? As on croc and princess your pet can’t melee but a wind serpent could still lb as you kite
---
Why not r3duce risk to raid and move to anothe4 angle that puts you at cleave risk but not the group? (I have never done classic ony)
---
But since a BoE has the same value for all classes, you can either roll greed and hope everyone does the same, or roll need and then tell everyone to do the same to protect the group
---
I’ve been killed by at least a dozen of these people. 
---
All DernyShooty and Yeettus want to do is get to 60 :(.
---
I just can’t stand how bulky armor looks on males.
---
Yup already stopped playing classic cos its been the true vanilla experience of sitting in org for hours on end doing nothing and watching youtube/netflix while semi-afk. Will let sub lapse and renew when pvp comes out then probably let sub lapse again after 1 week of wpvp till BGs come out.
---
This is the reason I never went ironforge back in the day, I always stayed in stormwind. It would take me forever to get past the AH in ironforge because of the lag but stormwind was always fairly quiet, darnassus was just dead though, nobody went there 😂
---
Okay good to know. I have no problem with that pull, the most trouble I have is the pull where slip kik patrols. I’ve been freezing on reaver and the scatter the  other and run halfway up the ramp or a bit less. Usually this works but once in awhile the warlock hits me with a slowing curse as I use my invis (instant cast apparently) and it takes me out of invis and I just die.
---
First of all, don't do 10 man Jed/Rend, you can easily do 7 man and 5 man if the players are good and decently geared.
---
Second, because so many people roll on it, and it has a pretty meh drop rate (about 1 in 4) it can take a ton of tries to get it.
---
Third, even running ubrs at all requires a key, making finding groups a little harder than other dungeons.
---
It isn't the hardest thing to get, some really low drop rate items like Savage gladiator chain are obviously harder to get, but compared to items like senior designer pantaloons, onnicast boots, and kinetic amice, it is not the easiest to farm.
---
Was a therotical question
---
We did over 200 brd runs from when we were 52 to get both our tank and a Rogue HoJ. So yeah needless to say I would never run it for the second HoJ if I wasn’t certain our MT would get it. I don’t think we’re more important than other people I just don’t want to spend 10+ hours of my life running a dungeon to get an item for someone I’ve never met and will likely never run into again. We just 3 manned it eventually but for people who don’t have good gear and guildies I cannot blame them for refusing to open roll for an item you may see 1/100 runs. What would you prefer? They ban other Rogues? This way they at least let others come who need different items but don’t blacklist entire classes.
---
That sounds more like an afk multibox.
---
Pally axe btw
---
I haven't come across a bad mage yet. Every instance I've done since dead mines. I've had at least 1 group per dungeon with a hunter that ends up pulling 4 packs and wiping the group with their stupid pet. Was running Mara the other day and before my charge landed (Tanking) the hunter had thrown out a multishot. Even after asking to slow down for a bit they just herp derp button smash. Huntards are still huntards to me. As for mages, dungeon mages have been very kind and always slow the dps at the start when asked. Mages out in the world, dicks. All of them. Blinking to snipe nodes. Killing "kill quest" mobs and refusing to group. Leaving me after I engage the horde that was killing them. I'm almost to the point where I just say no hunters in my party but I hold onto hope that there are good ones out there but they just avoid me for some reason.
---
The butt thing is just the "shut up and let me play explanation". 
---
Sometimes a character looks cool. Everybody understands that male night elfs are ugly.
---
I wouldnt play a male cloth character cause they usually dont look cool. They always have fucking big ass arms and it just doesnt fit.
---
I loved the way my night elf looked. Especially when I main a dwarf male.
---
Tho sometimes it is not like that. Dwarf priests and paladins in cloth somtimes look dope.
---
damage mitigation from armor scales inversely with levels, you need more armor with every increasing level to reach the same mitigation value as before.
---
Generally your damage mitigation doesn't change much unless you're a 60 tank in the process of gearing. For example, mages will hover around ~15-20% (made up value, forget the actual) mitigation despite their level and gear. Higher ilvl gear does have higher armor but it's gradual increase over several raid tiers.
---
dbm is off a few seconds but as long as they back out before the time ends then wait until the icon for the spell pops onto the screen they should be good
---
Why are you being intentionally dense. No one is advocating anyone do that. In fact every single person who says “all need on boes “ would agree that should never be done. Why do people keep using this slippery slope as a counter argument ?
---
Ask guild for a layer swap. Problem solved
---
Imagine the queues again when BGS are released
---
This! I had run Uldaman 8 times over the weekend. I put together a group, I did not reserve anything but I looked for priest, not pally, healer. I then filled with non-warrior DPS. Stoneslayer dropped and I was very happy. That is about as far as I would go but I don't think I did anything wrong in composing a group to my needs
---
Didn't they nerf mage zf farm just like this? Silently? I heard the zf gy 40g per hour is also nerfed
---
I actually have killed so many people by throwing curse of reckless on mobs they feared
---
A couple years ago it was common sense that classic wasn't going to be a thing but here we are. You really don't know it all man
---
I don’t ever once in my time playing wow remember seeing the definition of need written by the creators of the game. They never specified what your claiming to be true. I do actually need that item, it is the same as any other BoE of ifs value it can be literally traded for something I can use of equal value. That’s not me being greedy, you just can’t see past the first step of “ohhh a shiny item dropped someone who rolled that class must equip it now!”
---
wow really? i didnt know after the first 3 replies that said this exact thing
---
Vanilla didn’t have diminishing returns. The player in question would sap, the duration would show 60 seconds, I would break early, he would vanish, let me walk forward, then sap me and the process would continue over 20 minutes. Nice observation though, you must be incredibly intelligent to call me out on insinuating I was sapped for a duration of 20 minutes though. 
---
/s
---
Think he means it's more realistic since Lionheart is kinda expensive atm
---
I like ST, the main issue is it's a 2+ hour run.
---
So true. It's up there with the whole "Not to be..." thing that even pervades real life society.
---
It sure does.
---
Unless you're on a realm where even devilsaur gloves are 200g, and the pants are 3-400g.
---
And trying to actually get true strike is a nightmare with 60% of the server being wars.
---
Liquid assets benefit everyone the same.
---
The nbg window was literally invented to vendor BoPs. That's it.
---
Everyone should roll need on blue+ BoEs.
---
There are infinitely more references to Northrend than there are references to Outlands....
---
It's not that. The original addon has literally been around since the start of WoW, the devs never took issue with it in over a decade. It's also still functional in the Retail client, they only broke it for Classic.
---
Logically, yes, BoEs are basically just a gold drop. If you equip the BoE you're saving yourself however much it's worth on AH, and if someone else wins the roll they can sell it and buy a BoE they need so it's worth the same for everyone and everyone should roll on it.
---
Horde easy mode.
---
Toughen up buttercup.
---
But it doesn't have the same value for all classes, that's the problem here. For someone who can't use it, it has a greedy gold value. For a class that can use it, it's an upgrade and has real-game application.
---
If a BoE drops that no one can use, go right ahead and all roll need for gold.
---
Classic is my first experience with people "reserving" items in a dungeon when it isn't a full guild run. That's a big nope from me dawg.
---
That’s not true at all. There are so many players that carry other loot they aren’t using in their bags. You don’t only keep the one set of gear that you wear, do you?
---
You’re the one crying because you think I took items I don’t deserve in a game lol.
---
&gt;Gear is hard to come by in classic
---
It is, and it's also not required to progress. People are already doing 15-25 man clears of MC. There was a 10-man Ony kill recently and there has been many 15+ man Ony kills. There really is no requirement for your full raid to be all MC geared, or even for a full raid as you can see. This content isn't hard. So trying to say something like "we need to raid now to get everyone geared to prepare for the next raid" really doesn't work.
---
&gt;and know what you are doing
---
This is gonna be a big issue for a lot of tanking trying this out. They’ll assume they shouldn’t need to toss on a shield if things get sketchy, or assume all bosses can be dual wield tanked.
---
Nope. How would they have dealt with paladins and shaman? Just not allow only them to transfer?
---
Faction change was not added in vanilla.
---
BoE green = greed unless you need
---
   BoE blue = greed if you don't want it at all and it has a low market value, everyone else need
---
   BoE epic = need regardless of all situations.
---
If it went down like 
---
\-player 1 rolls greed
---
\-player 2 rolls need
---
players 3 thru 5: "Uhhh wtf man?? We're supposed to greed those? Now we're gonna need to try to stop you from ninjaing"
---
Then players 3 thru 5 are not jerks, player 2 is the jerk
---
Never underestimate shitty code thrown together to meet a deadline.
---
3 was disappointing.
---
A quick google search has me calling bullshit. Every source I’ve read says a VPN can get you banned, but it’s usually because of a suspicion of account sharing and an appeal fixes it. The vpn isn’t the crime. It’s the appearance of logging in from multiple locations indicative of account sharing that triggers a ban.
---
Ah no man just simplify it. I think the first site I saw outlining that was wowclassicbis.com or something of the sort
---
Lul Iganklowbies from pservers?
---
I would also recommend looking at what you and your warlock friend could do to not steal aggro. Reducing the damage you do is a viable answer to tanking problems. Generally while leveling it's all about efficiency, so it might be worth the rogue taking threat at the end of a fight to split the damage taken to the group evenly. 
---
Generally I would work with the assumption that if you or your warlock friend are taking aggro you need to learn how best to deal with that. For example it might be worth your warlock friend draining life at the end of a fight and tanking mobs. Or you could use your evasion cooldown to tank every 5th pull. 
---
Also, some advice for your tanking friend, I would say that tanking doesn't mean you need to have aggro all of the time from every mob, if they focus most of mobs on them they are doing a good job, if one enemy slips away it might not be worth chasing it, especially if that enemy is less than 20% health.
---
BOEs; where the Greed button is the same as the Pass button. With the Need button being the new Greed button.
---
Shadow Priests are currently the #1 1v1 PvP class in Classic WoW.  They are by no means a meme spec.
---
Don't base your class choice on raiding.  The most fun in the game comes from PvP.  Join a guild and make it clear that you want to be a shadow priest, but are willing to heal if they don't want to take one to raids.  However, when SP gear drops, you want to be able to roll on it.
---
Longest? Seriously? One quest a day.
---
&gt; BoE items are just gold. Everyone in the party earned that gold, and everyone in the party deserves to roll on it.
---
you are a complete and total idiot. dumb commie shit spewing out of your slackjawed mouth
---
I like the way you think.
---
I was questing in Blasted Lands and Bloodrazor dropped from a random mob.  I equiped it.  
---
It was an upgrade for me (lvl 50 Rogue using...I forget at the time in my MH).  I saw it was selling for roughly 125 G in our AH and thought about selling it but hey...I've never had a purple weapon before, I'm not starving for gold, and it looks awesome so sweet...I'll use it.
---
Am I gonna have the gold for my 100% mount when I hit 60?  Nah.  Would AH'ing this have helped?  Sure.  But having it &amp; using it is a ton of fun.  I'm not on a timer here.  Hell, I don't know what BiS even is for me.  I'm just having a good time playing.
---
So if I were in a group and a high end/high AH value BOE drops AND it's not an immediate upgrade for me I'm gonna roll greed.  If it's an immediate upgrade I'm gonna roll need.  And finally, most importantly...I ain't gonna worry about it beyond this post.  It's just RNG to me.
---
Hoj is bis for tanks as well. So why is he less entitled?
---
I've done the arena something like 30 times and have never even seen him spawn. Friend of mine got the chest on his first ever BRD run though, and HoJ on his second.
---
Shut the fuck up
---
Or, y'know more likely. It's a pally just healing the dungeon but collecting offspec gear . .
---
Do we know when the weekly stv fishing event will start?
---
Did you guys have any advanced notice of us coming? You mounted a defense pretty quickly after we rolled through stormwind.
---
Skipping raid? Seems like fake news
---
I thought I was crazy for having 2 already.
---
If you did the quest only once a day, it would take you a little less than 3 years to get it
---
Vanilla.
---
Yes it does, even if it shows that it is for retail it works perfectly for classic too!
---
PvP servers seem like a great idea for people who enjoy PvP in general. Then they start levelling and realize the grave mistake they made. In turn, a monster is created. The cycle continues as they begin to slaughter innocent low level players, just trying to quest.
---
Nothing like a fair fight eh....

What?  Googling gives very poor search results and mostly seems to be sourcing Michael Critons quote.  You've not demonstrated that my two prior stated facts are wrong.  In doing so, you have shown yourself to be firmly in the conspiracy theory camp that takes significant stock in tin foil.
---
I'm a weaponsmith / hammersmith and I think armorsmith would have been better. Maybe the grass is greener? I have access to like 6 different hammers half of those are 2h and the other half 1h, only like 2 of them are useful.
---
This "issue" of tanks reserving stuff is a story as old as vanilla.. there's a low amount of tanks compared to dps and healers. I don't understand why you are arguing it? 3to1 means an unbalance. That's gonna lead to reserving or payment. It's simple supply and demand. You are def an angel on Earth for running dungeons for no reason but to assume everyone else to is naive. It wouldn't be a thing unless people agreed? They agree because they would rather get going than to wait 3 hours for a tank like you to finally come by.
---
Except once again - looking at an items average value isn't the same as it's absolute value - The value of an upgrade to a person is immediate and determined, the potential value of an item on the open market can be assessed to an average - but it is by no means absolute (or objective) - so you should probably stop saying that since it really makes it seem like you don't know what you're talking about.
---
If you're waiting for me to capitulate and tell you that it's OK for you to be a greedy loot ninja, that's not going to happen. Honestly the way this conversation is going I think you care an awful lot about the size of your wallet, and you might be a lot happier on retail where you can get all the gold you want for no effort. If you're interested in being part of an actual community and doing your part to be a healthy member of that community, you're going to have to realize that need&gt;greed, and it has since WoW came out.
---
I'm sorry the world doesn't work the way you want it to. Your life will get much, much easier once you learn to work with that fact, though.
---
3g 50s
---
You can do it naked, it would just take you more time
---
Yeah I guess you might be tanking and have an edgemaster's for dps set and trying to ninja another pair of edgemaster's
---
Questing right now and not having this happen at all. Every other mob leashes and returns besides my target.
---
To play a game in an environment where the idiots/the selfish/the impatient/the socially inept people get weeded out bc no one will tolerate them.
---
FaCtS and LoGiC! I should've guessed you were one of those projectionists ;) 
---
It's selfish because denying someone an upgrade because you care more about the size of your wallet than about being a good teammate is an indefensibly selfish position to take.

Need&gt;Greed, and it always has.

Your friend is living the dream, that is what we all hope and pray for every day and every night, indefinitely forever.

Yeah, the BM hunter kill command "execute" doesn't have the same umpf (in retail).
---
BoE blues being an upgrade for a player shouldn't give them any special claim to them. They have a monetary value and it should be fair game for anyone to roll on. Another player can decide to pass or sell to the player it is an upgrade for at a discount out of courtesy, but it is not to be expected. Any other arrangement should be discussed in advance. I had one run where a player wanted an item that went for 65-75g on the AH and we agreed that if he paid each of the other players 10g we would skip the rolling and everyone was happy.
---
CoW or CoT depend on enemy.
---
When I did the math on my server several weeks ago, it came out to less than 50g to level up alchemy from 0-300 by buying stuff from the AH.  Prices have skyrocketed though and I haven't re-ran the numbers, but I expect it's over 100g by now.
---
the same way paladins did it
---
they take it for as long as possible and swapped out and was done and became a dps (pally heals)
---
it is possible as a strategy but it means all 40 man had to work around it.
---
Dont interrupt the benediction quest for priests. Especially as another priest. Nothing in the world felt worse than going to bed knowing I didnt have benediction that night pafter I was given the eye. (I'm on a PvE server, for anyone who doesnt know, all someone has to do is run through the mobs, say an undead priest if your alliance, and it will be considered "helping" which will trigger "The Cleaner" and you get one shot and the quest give despawns for 2 hours.)
---
Edit:spelling &amp; clarity
---
Recklessness, bloodfury, windfury, and that +5 axe bonus for orc warriors is nightmare fuel for everyone involved. I almost feel guilty dumping all of those at once.
---
Hmm I think what matters to healers is how much damage you take, regardless of health. If a dude has so little health that any of your heals are going to overheal him, but has so much mitigation that every point of health is worth way more, then by all means, please do that. I don't care if a dude has a shitton of health if he still dies in 2 hits, or if he's impossible to keep up.
---
Really, what matters to healers is 2 things :
---
- How fast you die. If you die in 2 hits, and the mob attacks once every 2 seconds, I've literally just got 2 seconds to react to a hit and heal you before you die. Or I have to pre-cast all the time for fear that you'll die and can't focus on anything else. Even if it's just 1 more hit before you die, so 3 total, it's going to have a huge effect. That's just breakpoints, so your ehp/mitigation is not going to be worth much until you hit that breakpoint where you can survive 1 more hit. And it depends on the boss so it's annoying to calculate.
---
- How hard you are to heal : how much mitigation you have. Doesn't matter if you can survive 10 hits if you mitigate so little that I have to constantly heal you just to keep up with the damage. I'd much rather have a tank that dies in 3 hits but mitigates a lot and that I can keep up with small heals, saving my mana and time. The more you mitigate, the more my heals are worth, and the less mana I have to use to keep you up.
---
So no, healers don't only care about health pool. They care equally about mitigation and ehp, you have to balance those out as a tank.
---

Literally this. Holy crap, I remember tryna go in to  SW and regretted it as it took an hour just to get tf out there
---
It's great that you could relive this.  
---
Although I think you mostly enjoyed playing together with your girlfriend, not exploring the world (you already know every corner of).  
---
It'll be back to speed leveling once you're playing on your own again ;-)
---
But that's hypothetical. You're asking someone to not need an upgrade that they actually do need so that you can be greedy in the hopes of turning that item into gold and eventually, hopefully, into an upgrade for yourself.
---
That's why need&gt;greed, because actual value&gt;hypothetical value.
---
I don’t remember ‘reserved’ being a thing in vanilla.
---
I don't know why people like you keep spreading misinformation...
---
1) Go to Wetlands and Rank 1 moonfire/fireblast/whatever a Murloc with the intention of aggroing it plus a friend. If you aggro two murlocs at the same time with 1 spell, congratulations, move on to the next step. (These are Murlocs A and B)
---
2) Now run next to another murloc and aggro it. (This is Murloc C)
---
3) Run in a straight line away from them while striking Murloc A every 6-8s. Don't hit Murloc C, and don't heal either.
---
4) If you've done all of this correctly, Myrloc C will de-aggro while Murlocs A and B won't. 
---
Prior to this hotfix, Murloc B and C would both de-aggro.
---
I mean bwl is harder.  And like the post you replied to says, it’s not a quick process gearing 40+ people out.  So the sooner you the start, the easier bwl will be.  And that will snowball into aq40, etc.  The current content might be trivial but it does get harder and gear makes it easier.  You can’t bring a raid of fresh 60’s into aq40 like you do with Mc.  That’s the point of progressing as a guild.
---
At the end of the day you’re playing the game at your own speed.  There is nothing wrong with that.
---
those kind of names tick me off for some reason

Definitely thought this was going to be a montage of one-tapping people as they make it to land.

I would argue for [Annihilator](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12798/annihilator).

Is it possivoe for the fury war to stand on the opposite side of ony if say the raid is all stacked on the left tail so you can execute and die to your hearts content?
---
Running through the same thing! GF just started WoW Classic with me and its been a blast. Ive played since vanilla and she has never played a MMORPG, but she picked up quick and was way better than I had been when first playing. We have been wanting to play lots more, but unfortunately we have college courses that is taking up all of our time along with work.
---
My friend who got me into the game during bc was so frustrated with me because of this.  She wanted me to raid with her.  I was so clueless that there was no way I was going to be able to raid even if I rushed.  She stopped playing, so I switched to non pvp server so I could pick flowers and made it to level cap half a year later.  :)
---
First...  Are you sure it was legit. Did you click any links in the (possibly phishing) e-mail?
---
Secondly...  If it is legit, there are numerous reasons it could have happened.
---
BEST? Tailoring and Engineering, I think. Tailoring gives you access to some sweet BOP gear, and in later phases, provides that 2% Crit  from that 3 set bonus (Bloodvine I think? Name escapes me now). Engineering is a shoe in though; no matter what class you are, Engineering is always the best profession (kinda annoying tbh). Due to all the stuff it has that requires Engineering in order to use. 
---
I've started to level a Warlock myself, and I'm planning to go Tailoring + Skinning until I hit 60. Then switch out Skinning for Engineering twice (first Gnomish, then Goblin once I got the trinkets, etc). You can of course replace Skinning with a different gathering profession; it's just for gold. I just like Skinning. 
---
But I'm also planning to get my racial mount instead of (or in addition to) my class mount, since for PvP, non-class mount is best (class mounts count as spells; the last thing you want, is to get locked out of Shadow due to a an interrupt).
---
despite the sarcasm I’ve pushed this logic onto people who always need on BoE or just open chests without rolling.
---
We all **Need** gold, so if we Need on BoE for AH gold, why is it any different than rolling **Need** on a 1-5g vendor BoP? 
---
Why is it any different than rolling **Need** on that BoE green that is selling for 6g89s99c on the AH? Yeah it vendors for 20s but I can AH it for almost 7g, and if they really **need** it, they can buy my auction. 
---
Why should I unlock the chest for you? If you **NEEDED** the chest, you should have rolled a Rogue! Guess that means its all mine!!
---
Hell, we should roll on fecking greys and whites too, some of those vendor for over A WHOLE GOLD COIN!
---
Or... maybe we can you know... work like a team while we are IN A TEAM, DOING GROUP CONTENT?
---
Its not greedy to know your worth, if i am your only option and i have no reason to go, making it worth my time is mot greed its self worth
---
Holy zerg Batman

I am quite the heavy addon user but still try to keep everything as minimalistic as possible. Have a few WA things I've done for my own comfort (example: the MH OH under my UnitFrame shakes when no poisons are applied to my weapons, otherwise it's not shown)
---
and if they didn’t have the 300 gold on hand to buy it, and thought, hey, i’d rather try running the dungeon until it drops? how is that not seen as a valid way to obtain the item that they Need over party members whose use for it, literally, is Greed?
---
Could form a group of players willing to farm for each other, then go after pieces at a time. If someone bails early you can blacklist them.
---
Treat it like challenge mode golds. Help others do the shitty ones you've already done so you can get to the good stuff.
---
So what are the other players supposed to do? Roll greed and hope no one ninjas? If someone rolled greed without thinking I would hope the group gave him a roll and traded it over if he won but not all groups will be that nice
---
Well logs says you don't so, guess it's just skill/gear difference.

I mean to be fair if someone is looking for a final party member and asks for a priest it’s pretty safe to say they need a healer.

If you found a $500,000 watch would you wear it casually? You'd be fucking retarded to wear that unless you were already obscenely rich. To 99%+ of the population, that watch provides significantly more value if sold. You don't need a $500k piece of jewelry to tell you the time, and a low level player doesn't need a 500g item to get from level 20 to level 25.

Warlocks don't get great until mid bwl then they are a top dps until end game

It’s actually incredibly fun, I can afford it, time enjoyed is not time wasted.

I actually walked away from the game after this happened to me. Unreal. In the few chances where the game brings out the toxic qualities of someone, it’s full blown toxicity. Sorry, but it’s just a game and I’m not here to deal with people acting so awful on my free ducking time.
---
Honestly, by todays standard even the top guilds were dog shit back then. That doesn't mean they wern't the best at the time, just means that the game has evolved. And yes I am saying they couldn't figure stuff like that out because you can see it in literally every single video from back then.

He doesn't move out because he is threat capped, he moves out incase MC hit the tank and KT starts running rampant around the room. I don't want to be rude but you are clearly not even familiar with the topic you're arguing about.

You can have a look yourself at the rest, there's some fights like [gehennas](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/rankings/1000#boss=665) where rogues perform really well but generally warriors do out perform them and that gap will just get bigger and bigger the deeper into content you get. 
---
Overall warriors outperform rogues, that's just how it is. It's pointless to argue about this, you should if anything become the best rogue there ever was and prove not just me, but the classic community wrong, because obviously from that video, every other rogue who didnt rwck all the warriors must be bad players
---
I don’t have this problem, but whatever helps you sleep at night. Plus, a good tank knows to pull when the healer is at 75% mana. The healer can finish drinking before the first heal is needed. Try finding a better healer/party next time. I’m rooting for you!
---
Yea as a single target dps I think the rogue beasts a spriest but we’re right there if not better then mages.

Heartseeker is really, really Alliance skewed. I didn't transfer from Skeram as a Horde because the ratio on HS was even worse than the H:A on Skeram.

I’m not lying. I’m not saying I got banned for the vpn I was asking if that was a possibility. I’ve filed an appeal with blizzard. I know you have no reason to believe me but I’m telling the truth. I did not buy gold, leveling services or anything like that.

Yeah generally speaking I see the majority of people say that tbc was WoWs best expansion, with wrath being great but also the expansion that started to casualize and ruin WoW.
---
I’ve never heard of tbc not getting enough recognition.

I always advertise MH on reserve and then when the group forms I inform them all I'll be changing to ML on the wave before rend. The reading comprehension of the players in this game is abhorrent.

I think you will hit lvl60 before the end of the year.

I still remember going in to UBRS the first time as a 10 man expecting things to be super rough... cake walk, beyond easy compared to pre patch. When we hit up MC rags died like he was a wet paper towel.

I’m actually fine with it TBH, I think early content including raids should be easy for everyone to be involved in... but all the “haha vanilla was so easy” people are kinda forgetting a few things.

And yeah BWL broke more than a couple guilds back in the day, it’s going to be interesting to see how things go this time around.

Plenty of good axes and troll racial sucks ass for dps. You have to be very hurt for it to work well as it scales with missing health. Making it very hard to use effectively. The orc one however gives full value all the time and just reduces healing on you. 
---
Sword are only super BiS in nax, and the best offhand gives you sword skill. Weapon skill have severe diminishing returns after like +6-7 and the offhand sword in nax is what that's for making the human racial pointless after getting it. So, use the good axes until then, orc master race. Not to mention who doesn't love having 30% stun resist baseline?
---
I wish they’d just put dual specs in already.. I’m set for max DPS to help the raid but I really don’t like my spec.

It's sort of a dick move because anyone could have taken that BoE and converted into gold to buy their own BoE.
---
If you get 60 and Lionheart plans drop in an UBRS and no one on your server has those plans yet, you've struck gold. Are you barred from rolling on them because you're not an armorsmith when you're in a PUG? I'd sure hope not...
---
\+wep damage is best for stoneslayer at your level assuming your MS spec
---
i just pretend to be afk now when people whisper me, at first it was fun but now i cant log in and check the AH without getting 2-3 people spam me for water or portals
---
No it's not, your logic is flawed and stupid. Stop repeating this same dumb shit after people have repeatedly debunked how fucking awful it is at every level.
---
Troll hunters, specifically male, have the highest asshole ratio in my experience. Dunno why. Taurens are nearly always good guys.
---
It only happens if they are scripted to pull together, not just two mobs of the same faction standing close by. Example would be like the dragons in Sunken Temple when you pull the boss are scripted to pull no matter what, but in a Murloc camp, two murlocs next to eachother aren't "scripted" to pull, they are pulled to "assist an ally", and are able to be dropped.
---
That’s not even a remotely unpopular opinion.
---
The robes aren't that rare. Guildies got a few of them farming for other stuff, but I do highly suggest you start farming that as soon as you can 57-58 and dont stop till 60 if you have to.
---
So then prot warriors are best dps in the game because they buff all melee damage via sunder stacks and/or battle shout? Or is it pallies because they buff a whole raid with buffs that increase their damage output?  Or is it healers because them healing people allows the dps to do damage for longer. 
---
Every class outside rogues and warlocks provides a utility to raids that arguably increase everyone’s damage, spriests are no different.
---
You’ve made an enemy for life Noobar!
---
No, you claimed it was “mostly a status symbol”, which is objectively wrong.
---
If you want to say “I just don’t want one as it’s not worth it to me” then that’s cool. Spend your gold however you please. But trying to say they aren’t useful and major timesavers for the vast majority of players is incorrect.
---
Nobody is telling you that you can’t spend your gold however you like, but when you make an assertion about something it certainly is “up for debate”. That said I was simply questioning your logic out of interest, something you really don’t seem happy about.
---
Some people love being the underdog.
---
Makes it that much more satisfying when you do well xD
---
yes.
---
I agree with this.
---
I think dropping Dire Maul was to help the *CASUAL* player progress through MC.
---
The raid mechanics of MC aren't hard, the RAID MECHANICS of vanilla are outright punishing. Trash that respawns quickly, long walks back to your bodies, very easy to wipe on trash if you pull badly, people getting 1-shot out of the blue by trash.
---
Phase 2 isn't going to be the most interesting, but even streamers have all said they are going to be doing the pvp grind hard. And some like swifty said they are going to go hard for a few weeks to get rank 13/14.... its going to take MONTHS of 20+ hour days to get to high ranking, especially without BG's your going to be hunting for fights.
---
there is diminishing return.
---
for fear, and poly, and trap, and stuns, and just about everything else.
---
you are all wrong. bring on the downvotes im right lol
---
&gt; My guild leader is around run 357 for ironfoe and still doesn't have it.
---
This isn't terribly surprising - the droprate of Ironfoe is something like .4%, so the chances of going 357 runs dry is still something in the ballpark of 24%.
---
I'd love to have an Ironfoe - cool item, and certainly a pretty good one at this point... but target farming it is asking for a lot of tedium.
---
You can level all the way to 60 as a fury warrior. Just keep a shield in your bag in case your healer has trouble. You will be able to find groups much quicker as a tank. You don't need to spend a single point in protection until you raid.
---
Druid here. I do the same. I even go as far as /mourn the druid I may have had to kill in a larger pvp fight. Say a little something. I play on an rppvp server so I get really into these rules. Especially in Moonglade. Inversely, when I played a warrior, it was the opposite, you showed a warrior respect by waiting until his mob was dead but always fought them. Always. And when the respawn you bow and ride away.
---
90+ runs in myself at the moment, saw hoj drop once and rolled a 9. Feels real bad, man.
---
Sometimes a boss (or trash) doesn't drop the item you need. You could spend countless hours running the same dungeon over and over, never seeing the drop you need. 5 people put in all the effort to clear a dungeon, maybe looking for one item and never seeing it. This is exactly the same. The BoE drops but someone else needs it, ie. No item dropped for you.
---
Both in Classic and original Vanilla, Warlocks always had the potential to do as much DPS as Mages. But Mages had multiple mechanical advantages over Warlocks that naturally countered all the... well, I'll just say it, frankly bizarre and annoying mechanical problems of Vanilla, so they were far preferred over Warlocks (and there was community perception to contend with, to boot). So Warlocks were generally just relegated to buffing the Mages with Curse of Elements.
---
For me it's the other way around.
---
I am enhancement and constantly fighting the urge to go deep into restoration.
---
last I checked the respec cost is only reduced 5g every month and will never go below 10 gold after you have reached that threshold... also it will not go down at the 5 gold respec cost.
---
I pity alliance mages/locks lmao
---
Nice double-meaning meme.  You don't see these often.
---
I don’t see how shadow priests healing dungeons would affect my sleeping pattern but sure. Maybe you don’t have this problem because you’re super awesome at the game but every shadow priest that I’ve done a dungeon with who said he could heal has gone oom very often and makes the dungeon take much longer than it would if they were healing specced. No one is saying it’s impossible to heal a dungeon as shadow, but it wastes everyone’s time.
---
I play as a Female Nelf Priest and that's because I dramatically prefer their cast animations, they also look graceful instead of goofy like the males. 
---
Add the fact they look significantly better in Priest gear and for me it's a no brainer to pick them. I play both male and female characters. You don't have to be locked to one gender in a video game. It's a video game.
---
Oh boy. 
---
&gt; Honestly, by todays standard even the top guilds were dog shit back then. That doesn't mean they wern't the best at the time, just means that the game has evolved. And yes I am saying they couldn't figure stuff like that out because you can see it in literally every single video from back then.
---
You realize you’re talking about Kungen, a player who is still frontrunning in modern wow to this day. Do you think he just wasn’t minmaxing during Naxxramas and pressuring his fellow raiders to do the same? I’m curious when you think he started trying. Karazhan? Kael’Thas? Brutallus? 
---
&gt; He doesn't move out because he is threat capped, he moves out incase MC hit the tank and KT starts running rampant around the room. I don't want to be rude but you are clearly not even familiar with the topic you're arguing about.
---
KT will never run rampant around the room. If the mc hits the tank(which it does) there is a tank under him which picks up threat. He moves out for the frost blast because melee spots are limited. If it had anything to do with uncontrollable threat, the rogues would be moving out as well. They don’t because their ceiling is higher and they can spend more time on the boss without passing the OT.  The spread is entirely for frost blasts and has nothing to do with the MC. If the warrior’s uptime were more valuable, he’d be sitting on the boss and a rogue would be moving out. This simply isn’t the case. 
---
&gt;WCL links for MC encounters when the entire discussion was about which spec scales better. 
---
Do we really think MC encounters that are lasting under a minute are indicative to how specs perform during prog in naxx as dps specs dramatically outpace tanks in threat generation? Your argument is disingenuous at best.
---
Roleplaying females.... so trans?
---
I usually life tap my mana up and then bandage myself. Most of the time though I get healed as soon as I use the bandage. The good priests toss a renew on me then sit down to drink and leave me to it. If need be I'll drain life during the next fight for a top up.
---
There are a few things I would understand, like shadow silk, abom stitching, etc.   
---
You are to do it the old way.  Don't invite anyone who can use it.
---
you missed the story this dude told  a week or two back he did it to this guy THREE times before they got him om the third and camped him. Straight sociopath.
---
What's so cringe about them ?the only thing I can remember is when one of their guildies ninjad bindings and after the whole trade/world chat called them out their whole guild just wrote "unlucky" besides that I don't really hear anything negative from them
---
Just because the release plan is 2 years doesn't mean you'll retain subscribers for 2 years. If people drop off since it's too long between phases it may be more profitable to speed up releases in order to keep up subscription
---
Sounds like you don't need a group then.  Isn't everything working out for you?
---
It all comes down to location.
---
Darnassus is way out of the way. Even in Kalimdor it's not central in anyway it's the fucking roof of the continent.
---
It shares this problem with the Undercity but even worse because the Undercity is at least a bit closer to some more important areas.
---
Darnassus is basically good for going to Winterspring and that's it.
---
Every other capital city has a lot of decent nearby locations.
---
If the city was located in Ashenvale or Feralas you'd see a ton more people there on a regular basis.
---
You should have asked to roll on it and trusted that if your /roll was higher than the winner's that they would have given it to you since you missed the roll. Most nice people would oblige you because it's only fair.
---
But yeah, let this be a lesson to you- next time a blue or higher BoE drops just type "BoE- all need" and click need.
---
Practice. I have zero mods on classic and only basic rp ones on live.
---
You certainly noticed popularity of SW and IF change over the first month of classic. On my low pop server IF was basically dead for the first 2 - 3 weeks and SW was busy. Now that most regular players (3+ hours p/night) are 50+ IF is constantly busy while SW tends to be quiet.
---
i hate this server
---
I'd switch.  The server has like 2 raiding guilds unless you actually RP.  It's not like wyrmrest/moonguard at all, which were great servers IMO.
---
Druid tanks can hot locks up before pulls for extra aggro too.
---
Blue square hunter freezing trap!
---
I agree, except horde &gt; alliance so... Myth busted. /s
---
More and members are two different words?
---
And arcane spec mag...... ok I couldn’t finish that with a straight face sorry. 🤣
---
Could use the gloves from LBRS instead so you only need 5% hit from other items.
---
It’s French for rogue.
---
You think you can, but you can’t.
---
For raw stats you would replace T3 while leveling around 65-67. Sometimes set bonuses made wearing some of it optimal for much longer, though.
---
Hm ok, I think I’ll switch to Stalaag, a streamer I lie has a guild I think I can join!
---
The problem is holy nova has lackluster damage, and is super mana intensive. So you need someplace with mobs that don't hit very hard, as well have minimal health. That's not very many places unfortunately!
---
Based off private server logs they are worse than mages and warriors from start to finish. And you can't use vanilla data because people played like shit and various patches changed things around.
---
This is so what the internet is for and I love it!
---
Thank ya!
---
this, plus i rp and i find it fun rping female chars so fuck it
---
If the sword is good go for crusader (can cost 60-110g depending on server prices) if it’s meh grab a greater striking for +dmg as it will help you farm and is reasonably cheap. Plus it has a glow!
---
What do noobs and rogues have in common?
---
They both pick locks
---
As a shadow priest myself, this cuts me real deep.
---
As a paladin I aggro all 3 or 4 and just attack one and walk backwards away. Eventually the 2/3 ones that I'm not attacking will run back and I'll be left with one. At this point I heal myself but I know you're a warrior and not able to heal. Might help though?
---
impeccable performance
---
Get Questie and see if the quest is still showing up for you in Tanaris (usually works, there are a few bugs)
---
Lol 36 Warlock I love it. Ppl are nice, and mats are cheap. But if you want the full experience roll on a PvP server.
---
Get axesmith, get the arcanite recipe and you'll have something to sell on the AH for the entirety of classic. Armorsmith is nice because of the lionheart helm but my realm already has a hundred people selling it at any given time, and the recipe is still pretty rare on top of that.
---
This guy is correct.  Diminishing returns pretty generous in classic but they do indeed exist.
---
If they wanna be fed gear they should join a guild with loot council not pug with free rolls
---
Which one of those gives you the info at the top of the screen?
---
And they told us we didn't want this!
---
More time drinking than walking? Did you spec into spirit tap?
---
&gt; If someone else needs it, then you're rolling in greed. Literally the definition of the words.
---
Wrong. The definition of greed is "an intensely selfish want for something." Wanting money in general is not the definition of greed or else everybody with a job could be called greedy. A BoE benefits everybody equally, and thus either everyone is being greedy or nobody is. 
---
On the other side, the benefits of a BoP to someone that can equip it are significantly higher than the few gold you can get by vendoring it, so wanting a BoP you can't use does in fact fit the definition of greed.
---
&gt; Farm BoE epics all you want
---
I don't do this.
---
&gt; once you have someone in the group that needs the item, you've forced them to pay for it
---
If I win the lottery am I also forcing everyone else that bought a ticket to pay for their daily lives? How does that logic even connect in your brain?
---
&gt; you're quite literally being greedy.
---
Again, review the dictionary definition of greed. Greed is not equivalent to "want. "
---
I made a female warlock purely because I prefer tier sets on females rather than males but i am 100% a male character especially for plate wearers cause god damn my man looks sexy af with tier 1 paladin gear.
---
I've been surprised how many people don't tip  when I open their lockboxes, felt like everyone tipped on private servers.
---
Streamer guilds are rough from what Ive head.
---
There was just a post stating the literal opposite of this opinion FWIW.
---
Building is exceeding it's weight restrictions. No more than 10 Kodos or equivalent in any 100 square feet. Gonna have to shut this place down.
---
as a rogue who isnt at stv yet I sadly cannot use that..what i need to do is set mine for auberdine so i have access to both the boat to menethil and all the EK fps as well as all the FPs from kalimdor
---
oh is that what happened? lol its fucking crazy laggy here. ppl loading in as you move around around, everyone stuck in animations

Using ampified curse of weakness + shrinking ray on melee lowbies while they are fighting a mob is amusing.

^ Anakin btw
---
Warlock here. It's completely reasonable for you to tell them to not expect heals if they're going to lifetap down to 10%. A lot of warlocks also play poorly - they apply too many dots and then too many shadow bolts. The key as a warlock is to get a pulse for how fast things will die, and how much mana is really worth spending on any given target. If you cast a DoT you should be sure that you'll get the full duration. Generally if a warlock casts Curse of Agony and Corruption, life taps a few times, and sends a shadow bolt (or two) that's more than enough.
---
Tell the warlocks to manage their own health better. Health is a resource - life taps should be a resource to keep the DPS flowing, not to keep your healer's mana bar empty.
---
Now for the bullets:
---
* Use your healthbar as a mana bar if it makes sense to do so. If the pace of the group allows for more frequent eating, let the healers know that you'll be life tapping and eating food. If you want to life tap a bunch at the end of a pull where everyone's going to sit and eat, that's good. Do not expect heals if you life tap out of combat. Just don't.
---
* It depends on your spec, but let's just assume you'll be affliction based. Cast Agony and Corruption (somtimes only one or the other). If it's a very tanky mob, cast Siphon Life so you can life tap a bit more freely. If it's a very tanky mob (or boss) cast a Curse (not always agony! use your toolbox!), Corruption, Immolate, Siphon Life, and then do whatever else you need to do (shadow bolts, etc).
---
* Generally you will not use Drain Life in dungeons unless you have aggro. Corruption procs Shadow Mastery, which is your real bread and butter. Sometimes that will attract aggro, which then makes it useful to use Drain Life.
---
Oh and for god's sake if your group wants to use Hellfire, communicate about it. If you just Hellfire and make the tank's life hell, and the healer miserable, you'll just die.
---
It was a rethorical question but thanks for the info.
---
How much money do you think they make off people who unsub..? Some people will unsub if the game gets stagnant. Who knows if they'd make more money bringing out content to fewer customers over 2 years or to more customers over 1 year.
---
Level as arms. You can still tank easily. I'll say it again EASILY. I 2h Sword everything on my war from 1-40 and didnt have any issue holding aggro (some exceptions of course, like people focusing an npc I hadn't even had a chance to hit yet). You'll likely regret leveling as prot unless you have a squad you roll with all the time. Even if you have a squad I'd do arms leveling. Sweeping strikes with cleave/WW and a 2h sword was a lot of fun.
---
If people are bitching about you not being prot from 1-50 (I don't go prot till 54 at earliest)...they dumb.
---
No, no it is not. If something is an upgrade then BoE or not you roll on it and use it. You do not “need it just as much” because you can sell the item and buy something you want instead.
---
By that logic I could start rolling need on every single item - weapons especially! 5-7 gold a pop at the vendor? That’ll certainly help my epic mount fund, and a mount is equipment so therefore I need it just as much as you... right?
---
I’ve never had anybody in groups for 15 years not understand this and would simply kick anyone who tried that crap. Hell we had the epic DM book drop first day and guess what? We gave it to the tank, who now has one hell of a bitching sword.
---
respec dude.
---
Tactical mastery is the best talent in the game for a warrior once you get whirwlind.  As soon as you can get tactical mastery + bloodthirst go back to fury.
---
How do you get the costume? Saw a mage cast it on me earlier
---
Mount gold? *Laughs in warlock*
---
lol uuuvan mad, that he can't beat this argument so he deferred to "your flawed and stupid" "it's been debunked" ad homanim. L O FUCKING L
---
I always return buffs, but I'm a warlock so they always get an unending breath or detect invis 😂
---
I main a hunter and I have had so many rogues and warriors try to ninja ranged weapons because the pre-BIS  list told them to.
---
How much fire resist should I have  for raiding as a rogue?
---
My main is 35
---
This is the true answer
---
You actually lick pussy ? Hahahaha groce
---
(I assume he has instant CoA)
---
&gt;it's as legitimate as "hey I think these cloth healing gloves would be a small upgrade for my paladin". 
---
And this is where this type of sentiment falls flat in the classic community. Is it of the same value? Sure, by some subjective system of scales that you've made, while a much larger amount of people have said 'hey, if that's a legit upgrade for him let 'em fucking have it.'
---
Need over Greed, as the developers intended
---
&gt; Mostly due to how set bonuses work. Weapons, rings, necks, and trinkets were easily replaced prior to 65 in most cases.
---
not even this is true. this entire thing has got to be one of the biggest myths in world of warcraft history. in fact, a ton of items from t4 &amp; t5 content had to be buffed and/or reworked after release (some even had to be buffed twice) because they were so weak in comparison to naxx gear, and even after the buffs most items aren't that much better if at all.
---
the average naxx item is much better than the average item from t4 content. obviously there are weapons, that naturally are better just for sheer damage no matter the stats. there are also some select items with insane stat allocation that beats naxx gear, but in general what you say isn't true. almost any random item from naxx would be near if not on top of pre-raid TBC bis lists, and a ton of AQ items are on par as well.

Same with me! Just rerolled to a different server and went alliance for the first time ever. Hopefully I don’t regret it
---
Welcome to socialism.
---
I agree he should have talked over what to do if it dropped, and I get that people are super hesitant to hit greed and open the door for someone else to need on it... but the conversation should have allowed for him to manually roll and hopefully the winner  respects it.
---
Generally when a high value item drops though you absolutely don’t just click. Check with the run before rolling.
---
Lol, some dude in our guild the other day (massive guild) was like "Hey guys, I was enjoying hanging out with some people I met doing dungeons, and everyone in this guild is a lot higher level than me, so I am going to join their guild. Thanks for the fun times!". Everyone was thanking him for saying something and wishing him good luck (massive guild like this its pretty normal to see a few g quits a day where they say nothing). 
---
Few minutes go by, and the same dude goes "uhhhh how do I leave the guild?". 
---
I fucking /gquit myself trying to show him how, and he wasn't even trying to bait people. I had to be reinvited to much laughter.
---
I actually ran into a dirtbag warrior advertising "Jed/Rend runs" who had no intention of fishing for Jed. They were just advertising it as a Jed run because "we'll just run it and if he's up he's up".
---
Ran with them once because Jed was in fact up, then portalled out.
---
 Spy addon is lame for sure.
---
somthing tells me the prize money is going to be shared by people colluding. The fact that the rogue did not get punished is clearly bias
---
That addon is really broken in pvp and i do wish blizzard broke it but the odds are they won't. Because its a gray area slippery slope mambo jambino kinda thing
---
Noticed it works, but you also lose DPS somehow. 
---
I think it's not adding the multi shot and aimed shot damage but still counting as a auto attack cast
---
You also don't see groups waiting an hr in lfg for a healer. Supply and demand.
---
Mental illness, depression, addiction, etc. No matter how OP spins it, there is no good reason to be playing a game for 13 hours a day.
---
I believe a lot of people, especially at low levels, see an item as having more value in terms of gold. Most these items you will replace in less than 10 levels. 
---
For example, if someone took shadowfang and equipped it knowing they are going to out level it in a day or so of game time, a lot of people would be upset due to the gold value. 
---
The rule I’ve seen in every dungeon group so far is need on every blue BoE regardless of who needs it as an upgrade.
---
yea obviously assuming dps is similar, slower oh will be more inconsistent rage generation though
---
TRIES
---
&gt;made up scenario in your head, 
---
Not sure why you keep insisting this doesn't happen in-game. It does. You can pretend all you like, but it won't change reality. Anyway...
---
&gt;what if h y p o t h e t I c a l l y we both intend to sell the item, but I use the gold for a BiS items, and you use it to buy mats instead of taking the time to farm them, is the value still absolute? 
---
The value of BoE's is never truly absolute to begin with, nor is the value of time spent farming.
---
&gt;What if, h y p o t h e t I c a l l y, I know if a buyer on the server who is paying above market value for the item, whereas you sell it on the AH for its average price, so I turn the item into much more gold than you would have, are those values the same?
---
You've just now described *why* the value of BoE's is never absolute. But lets translate this line of thinking back to the original scenario. If a BoE is a bigger upgrade for Player1 than it is for Player2, does that mean Player1 should get the item? Would player 2 be "greedy" because they don't receive as much value from the item as Player1 would have?
---
&gt;Need&gt;greed
---
We've already established that it's not greed in this scenario when the end result for both players winning would be a shiny new piece of gear
---
There's a very good chance they will drop BG's early when people realize how fucking shit world pvp ranking is, once the thrill of "omg haha look at this hillsbrad battle hahaha" wears off and people start complaining about being corpsecamped and cannot move outside of capital cities. They have shown they are not hard set on the phases so that 's why a lot of people think they will release bg's early now.
---
This spec only gives the 15% boost to shadow fire if you sac a imp or succubus and if you sac the pet, you’re losing out of the 5 points you have allocated into the pet talents as well as master summoner. It looks like it’s a lose/lose
---
Edit: just kidding I had to re-read master summoner. This looks kinda cool actually but I would still rather play either with a pet or without one cause wasting all those talents when you sac would just feel mega bad. Also you don’t have access to corruption which just seems wrong
---
42 here as well. Out of game time. Waiting on payday to continue the journey!

As a night elf I often try to help Taurens. Take mob off them, cast a dot on their enemy running next to them etc. I'm way more friendly to Taurens then to gnomes lol

BOE = can sell to players or vendors for gold (or equip, when applicable)

You ran into ass hats here and there but EVERYONE was replaceable and still are. This isn’t retail where you click a button and poof someone magically appears. You can pick and choose more in Classic because you’re localized to one server. You get a rep of wanting to reserve stuff every run then people won’t run with you mainly because there’s always gonna be another Tank/or DPS wanting to go that isn’t gonna pull the BS.
---
Same here. If a person has a problem playing a female character, by extension they should also have a problem playing every race other than humans and dwarves. 
---
Personally, I just don't like how cloth armour looks on males.
---
It's a-ok to be a 15 foot man-cow as long as you don't have breasts, I guess.
---
Deciding between a human warrior and a human rogue. Don't have as much time to play as I used to, but still want to reach 60 and gear up eventually. Which class will be better suited for my situation? Less time to play, will likely have to play solo for a lot of it, etc.
---
Just discuss how people should roll before the dungeon starts, or when it drops
---
My Microsoft surface Pro 4 with the i5 runs it well. It just runs REALLY hot after a few minutes.
---
There are a few toys in retail that can get you drunk so that probably helps too.
---
Glad both the text and image are unique and definitely not things everyone keeps repeating.
---
put them on blast
---
Now compare this with Ironforge lol
---
&gt;They just want it to sell for mount gold.
---
YOU should be selling it for mount gold, too. Everyone should. The only items that matter for low levels are the weapons or wands. Everything else has practically no effect on levelling speed. 0.8 dps, 30 extra health and 0.05 percentage point less physical damage taken is never worth the opportunity cost of not selling the item.
---
Haha YES! I do this too! Polymorph them until they resist it, use a low level Frost Nova so they can't run, then polymorph some more. Since they don't die they can't even resurrect to escape.
---
How about fuck the opinions of the twats on reddit and do whatever you want however you want. That’s the glory of classic

anything goes. AP, crit or hit, high weapon damage.

For 14 AP you get +1 dps on your weapons

This is amazing. It's simply not possible we don't have the computing power to combine every realm. What's the bottleneck in these types of situations? Software? Blizzard's server software?
