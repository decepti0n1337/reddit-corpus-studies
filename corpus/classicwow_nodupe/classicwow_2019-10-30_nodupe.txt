I always wonder what do you get from multiboxing? How is this more fun than playing a a single character? No offense but I never understood the charm of multiboxing.
---
---
---
People are too thicc to detect your sarcasm it seems
---
Yes I can use it. I can trade it for part of an epic mount. Then I can get to instances faster.
---

---
The reason you can put a price on it is because it's tradeable. I'm not going to pretend BoE's aren't fundamentally different from BoPs. I like reality.
---
depends how much you like it, I mained druid most of retail [but havent played retail in a while] and love my classic druid
---
Good luck find or keeping a lock that'll deal with your attitude
---
you're like... really bad
---
I liked dailies when they were first introduced in BC and seemed like another option for ways you could make gold. The fact that felt entirely  optional was very important. 
---
There were no functional items, no gear you wanted to get or abilities you would unlock for your character or anything actually functional. A lot of dailies did give rep, but you could also get that same rep by running dungeons and hence didn't have to do dailies if you didn't want to. Likewise while you got gold from dailies they were definitely not the most efficient way of farming gold. The only items that were actually locked behind dailies were nether drakes and nether rays, neither of which changed your gameplay at all.
---
As soon as dailies stopped feeling optional they stopped being fun. When things like gear and enchants you want or the ability to fly at all start being gated behind dailies you feel obligated to do them and they go from being a cool option to feeling like a chore.
---
2 human rogues. No regrets. I rolled it originally because I play pservers to make sure I wasn't going to waste my time in classic.
---
This! I got married this month too and nothing from my guild cuz uh they‚Äôre basically all gone offline :(
---
So up through 8% hit, every 1% hit increase represents a 1% white damage boost plus a 1% increase in yellow melee damage (so an overall 1% increase in melee DPS). Beyond 8%, it's only giving me a 1% white damage boost (so, assuming white attacks are half my damage, an overall .5% increase in melee DPS).
---
On the other hand:
---
Crits are double damage attacks, so a crit can be thought of as a normal attack + an extra attack. Therefore, every 1% increase in crit can reconceptualized as a 1% increase in the number of normal hits, so an overall 1% increase in melee DPS.
---
Therefore, assuming you are at 8% hit and assuming you're nowhere near being crit capped, every 1% crit represents approx double the overall DPS increase that 1% hit represents. 
---
Does that sound right to you?
---
Thanks again for your thoughtful replies!
---
‚ÄúCasual‚Äù :o I‚Äôm jealous.

Cruel Barb is a myth.
---
best wow memory i have is back in vanilla....guild doing Baron Geddon and everyone put one paladin healer survives and gets real lucky and manages to kill him with a crit kill
---
I would like to know this as well!
---
I wouldn‚Äôt know I would never even bother making a character there, on alliance you have all the worker bees serving their drama queens, on horde you have all the trolling stream snipers looking for 10 seconds of fame. It‚Äôs not even WoW classic at that point.
---
What we do know is a bunch of hobbyists ran better servers from donations than Activision Blizzard.
---
üëè this üëè is üëè why üëè you üëè need üëè all boes üëè
---
Wrong on poison vendors. It uses Fadeleaf which is 100% not sold by any vendor in classic or vanilla.
---
Removing forced content and reitemising the game so it's much more like classic would make me to back
---
To me, the gold value is worth more than even having my bis. Since BoEs are tradeable, they are EXACTLY equal in value to everyone.
---
Pretending they are BoPs doesn't change that fact
---
You're broke mate. Gz though!
---
Theyre not mages, they are frostards. 85% of em are legit retarted.
---
Yeah jesus why is this whole thread so toxic? We have married couples in my guild... Why is that so unheard of? Isn't like 50% of WoW's playerbase female?
---
All of these comments about ‚ÄúWhy go to Herod?‚Äù I‚Äôm just sitting here with glowing hope in my eyes, hope that more make this decision as well. Thank you for coming to Herod Alliance.

Thank you for your time, I hope you enjoy all the adventures to come!
---
So strafe in LoS line and 360 spin jump back to face the mobs ezpz
---
Moshen is that you?
---
I‚Äôm a die-hard Tauren fan. It‚Äôs been that way since 2004 for me.
---
That response leads me to believe that you don't know what hypocritical means, champ.
---
&gt;After complaining to his guildies they basically said deal with it and came up with a bunch of BS to back one of their only 60s in the guild.
---
It's bizarre how many players are happy to defend blatantly shitty behaviour/attitudes. It's as if they get off to be contrarians.
---
In the past people would sell the unused characters
---
I have a mage in my guild who tops every meter in every raid we‚Äôve done. We still have to pug about 10 spots so we do MS&gt;OS rolls. Seven weeks of raids, and he hasn‚Äôt won a single piece of gear. Still tops every meter.
---
Haha feck off buddy :D Had to run to Thorium for FP :(
---
Yikes the horde salt ITT
---
Hear, hear!
---
this is a hilarious comment
---
Either way it needs fixing.  It‚Äôs a joke that private servers were actually superior in performance especially in large scale pvp compared to this ‚Äúblizzard quality‚Äù version.
---
That's good on you, though! You did the right thing. Little bits of selflessness helps the good people stay in the game.
---
I was in the Navy with a Bowman, he was one of the finest human beings I've ever met.
---
Why not? I mean, the T0.5 sets require more effort to acquire than Tier1, why is it wrong for some of the pieces to be better?
---
As long as I end up in Stormwind, idc what it takes..
---
Everything isnt just gold sacks. Anything bop is a magical item in itself. But it's also nice to occasionally win a big expensive piece of treasure  to sell OR use as needed. That's variety.
---
Sick dude BiS through the whole game
---
Laughs in tired meme
---
&gt;IMO there‚Äôs a reason the game drops loot and not just gold stacks...boiling everything down to its gold value takes away from a lot of the fun and immersion of actually playing in the first place.
---
Yeah cause if the game only dropped gold stacks we wouldn't have anything to wear... dumb comment. BoEs are practically gold stacks though, having the exact same value to everyone in the group as opposed to BoPs which are of course much better for the people who can use them.
---
gold is easy to get, mageblade isn't. I wouldn't sell it even for 12k gold
---
When did druid pick up for you and what spec did you go? I‚Äôve got a lock at 20 and druid at like 9 and so far druid has been a slow grind and lock has been a breeze.
---
I did as well! Nostalgia is a powerful force. :)
---
Congrats !!
---
I agree with this - it's the difference in unwritten rules / assumptions that causes problems.  I'd be fine with doing it either way as long as everyone's on the same page.
---
200g ain‚Äôt bad homie. Take it with pride.
---
Wish that was a picture from behind so I could see some blade
---
You‚Äôre missing the joke bro. You‚Äôre making fun of OP because he watches Rick and Morty. I‚Äôm calling your ass a hypocrite because if watching Rick and Morty makes you a child then playing video games makes your a child...which is what a hypocrite is.
---
r/woooosh
---
No - these sets are catchup gear.  What‚Äôs the point of catchup gear this early in the game?
---
As for the pvp objectives - I have no real opinion as most people don‚Äôt give a fuck about these.
---
Go to bed, Gramps, we run this server.
---
Sweet revenge for killing me 14 times when I wanted to do UBRS earlier.
---
but muh classix experince
---
fuck outta here lmao
---
Yea.. You need gold to buy BiS gear. Gold is easy to get, BiS gear ain't.
---
Have the offtank stand infront of you during the whole of p2 and when she lands hit her once and GG you will have aggro
---
is it wrong for a non-raid item to be better than a raid item?
---
Oh I agree, but I already have a mageblade :)
---
This makes sense for avoiding Winterspring, but farming the southern camp of Deadwood Furbolgs over the northern camp blows my mind. The speed at which you kill those in the northern camp should be very close to the speed in the southern camp but it seems there are more spawns in the northern camp and they drop Runecloth rather than Mageweave.
---
Only thing they are, is a douchebag on my ignore list.

my favorite memory was in my first mc raiding build back in 2005. we were terrible, truly, and it was awesome. one particular night we had just wiped on baron geddon fighting him in garr's room, to recover from said defeat one of our pallies had been DI'd. after baron reset, he pops the di and starts ressing folks, he gets 3 people up and all of a sudden, baron comes back into garr's room from no where, literally through the wall, one-shots the pally, and runs right back through the wall and resets again. comms were silent for about 30 seconds or so before all manner of hilarity broke loose. it's just one of those things that you couldn't replicate if you tried...

---
Society draws the line. It's like saying what's wrong with lightly flicking strangers. How about a light tap? A punch? 
---
Same here. Vendoring a piece that is otherwise only attained by randomly dropping from a boss for a couple of gold is shitty behavior. Vendoring a piece that could be traded and bought at anytime for a large sum of gold is far more understandable.
---
And if you make it about strictly rng then take away all loot drops and make it personal loot. Except they did that in retail and it sucked.
---
Maybe that's where I saw the name..
---
I'd let people know your intentions before starting the run, but in general it's accepted most people greed an orb when it drops.
---
Righteous Orbs are a bit special because they're typically the only thing a tank will ever want from Strath Live, it's not uncommon for 1/2 orbs to be 'reserved' for a tank to incentivize them to do the run so it's always worth clarifying first.
---
Some groups will probably be fine with it, some will want to reserve them for the tank, some will likely have multiple people roll need on them. The best thing you can do is let everyone know at the start so that if there are any issues you can leave the group and find another.

ahhh thats good to know thank you
---
I liked them in TBC because they felt optional. There was nothing gated behind them except cosmetic items (mounts) and the rep you got from most them you could get from other sources like dungeons. Because of this, for me, it was fun to occasionally do the bombing run quests or a daily here and there to make some gold. If I didn't do any dailies for 2 weeks though I didn't feel like I missed out on anything at all.
---
As expansions passed though that thought changed. Dailies became the only way to get rep, and that rep had items and enchants you wanted or other mechanics like the ability to fly at all, not to mention other stuff that was needed for your character like artifact power. Once they stopped feeling optional they stopped being fun and started feeling like a chore and now they are something I loathe doing.

Congrats on your marriage and awesome guild, friend. Sorry this thread filled up with sad, lonely boys who don't understand that marriage can be supportive and not destructive. They're just jealous.

Your remark of ‚Äú...because dicks must be sucked to be in the officers good graces...‚Äù and you refusing to contribute anything other than faceroll equivalent button mashing just further solidifies that you have a ‚Äúme me me‚Äù attitude and just want everything handed to you. You didn‚Äôt even help out your fellow Warlock raiders with the summonings, allowing them to use their shards while you hoarded yours when you could have helped them get the raid moving faster.
---
People are always going to want summons. You‚Äôre not benefiting anybody by refusing them, not even yourself.
---
I was in UBRS where this happened multiple times in a row and I thought I was going to cry. The tank died just before the heal went off. No problem, I'll save the OT - nope. Well, at least if I can heal this mage in ti- nope.
---
Druid main for life. Mobility, in demand all the time because of rarity and MoTW, heal/dps/tank. Amazing utility if you‚Äôre great at using it from off tanking to using innervate on someone important to the raid at the time. People don‚Äôt always see how much you do, but it‚Äôs satisfying knowing you were a key part to the success of the raid with some key utility usage.
---
As a healer druid. I will only spend 50g on farming spec then 50g for switching back.
---
Mine is too :)
---
Get adderall and all that boring stuff will seem fun - no joke
---
Sounds like you should stop playing if you dont enjoy it.
---
Because the vendor/disenchant value is a  lot less than the value of equipping it. And because the only way to get BOP gear is to loot it yourself. So the BOP gear is worth a lot more to someone that can use it than it is to someone that can't.
---
The BOE gear has the same value to everyone in the group. If it sells for 100g on the AH, that means the person that can use it saves 100g, and that means everyone else could sell it and use that 100g on their own upgrade.
---
You? Not the one in any of these scenarios.‚Äù‚Äù
---
 No bro, the focus now is on how you lack imagination. Define tech literacy anyway. I bet your bar is lower than mine.
---
You were arguing about what takes more steps. There are plenty of scenarios where even a tech literate person would be caught in a situation where using the camera on their smartphone would make more sense, and take less steps. You forgot what the conversation was already because you are feeble minded.
---
You don't rly make much raw gold. Mining is mandatory, and possibly enchanting for DE, ndepends on server economy heavily. Herbalism is also massive bonus
---
&gt;The problem with this is that it would fundamentally change the way progression in classic felt.
---
True.
---
&gt;They did this already to some degree (a few pieces of gear being available earlier than they actually were implement
---
Untrue. They gear progression has been **completely turned on its head** as a result of the 1.12 itemization. BRD blues being better than your blue dungeon set? Items with spellpower actually being available all over the place?
---
The pre-raid gear progression is already completely unrecognizable compared to vanilla. The gear that players are walking into MC with is 90% different.
---
I‚Äôm just going by your logic there bud
---
your ui though mate
---
usual answer by people with a lvl 10 warrior, a level 11 priest and a level 60 hunter
---
Keep making strawman arguments while you raid is waiting on you to be summoned, bud.
---
It's really quite simple. Show up for raid on time, and no one has to wait.
---
1 day for essence transmutes
---
Zul Farak. Even though I was a Wraith baby, ZF was the first dungeon I ever did before LFD was a thing so finding a group in chat and going there on foot was fun. It was also the first time I tanked content in a group setting thankfully they were patient with me. ZF will always have they special feeling for me.
---
If anyone reading this thread agrees that this situation is a problem, the Blizzard has a solution already in place. Blizzard is encouraging people to transfer to even out the populations.
---
Except you're not because that isn't what a hypocrite is lmao.
---
Feel that rand? Shit breeze
---
What's the rush in getting expansions? If they cater to the hunger of the hardcore crowd, we'll be in BFA in 2 years. Or does anyone think people won't obliterate tbc and woltk raids in a month?
---
Just go make alts and enjoy the game.  Nothing against playing for accolades, but retail is already there with 20 difficulties for each instance and a new grind every couple of months.
---
I, for one, am in no rush. Still a lot to see and do.
---
The first sentence of your response was an example so dumb I assumed you didn't want to actually discuss anything. Let's turn it around: if a Warden Staff drops do you auto pass to druids? If Lionheart Helm pattern drops do you auto pass to blacksmiths? Foror's? Skullflame shield? 
---
If you roll need, and you believe that some drop should be used by someone in the group, open trade and hand it over. Yaaaay you agent of justice, score one for the good guys. If you roll greed and believe someone else rolled need in a matter you personally disagree with, you have no recourse but to whine about how life is unfair.
---
This is a 15 year old argument.
---
Yes because fuck anyone who like PvP AND Raiding.
---
Favorite memory: I don't know so much of playing is now a blur, but my old self is loving reliving the game with a new group of friends.
---
lol, is that bad?  That's just what I randomly had free when I got that skill and I got used to hitting 4 for it.
---
If you're stealthed before aggro range of the combat log, you will go unnoticed.
---
This is cringey
---
I‚Äôm having a blast. My only suggestion is to improve the system of finding a party/raid, because sometimes I waste an hour just trying to find a party to run dungeons
---
It's called PvP. Seems to be really common on PvP servers.
---
I was confused because they made Blinding Powder available for purchase at the poison vendor after they removed it as a reagent just for the nostalgia. Fadeleaf was still farmable from mobs and pickpocketing junkboxes. But moreover, they could have just removed the reagent cost and kept it a poison or kept the reagent cost but made Blinding Powder available from the poison vendor but they didn't. They removed it as a poison because of dwarves. Also speaking to your example, you'll note that they nerfed WotF early on rather than later Fear spells and in Beta player Undead were literally that, undead. So WotF has seen it's fair share of changes.
---
Warlocks gets it almost for free so Gold is not √§n issue for him
---
That guy probably also thinks the girl should fuck him cause he randomly sent over a drink.  
---
You good to go man.
---
Bad troll is easy to spot
---
I jumped around a lot. I‚Äôm 57 and still jumping bc I havent had time to run the instances. Winterspring and Ferelas have been good
---
You certainly were, champ.
---
this is brilliant
---
Druid picks up at 20 when you get cat form, bear can take bits but puts out low dmg so it's just slow until then.

&gt; not needing rare BoE items to prevent being bamboozled by strangers

Nothing wrong with a nice night of fishing *cracks beer* *sip*
---
Again this was one example, if you are an active participant of this sub you are seeing posts about issues with the game every day.
---
I don't get it... SM/Ruin IS the drain tanking spec. Difference is you take ruin instead of dark pact
---
As the main tank I show up to raids with the early birds to get a head start on trash, so you‚Äôre actually the one making a straw man argument, and based on your usage of it, you clearly don‚Äôt know what it means and are just parroting the term in a desperate attempt to promote your own fallacies.
---
I like how you reuse jokes and comment on my comments. Keep on trolling, I‚Äôll take it all...kid*
---
That only works if no one needs that item as an upgrade.
---
This would be 100x better if you went to the AH later and see it posted there under his name and screencap that too, adding it to this.
---
\^ this. Every auto goes on these websites looking for the 'best build for X' and follow it to a T. End result = everyone looks the same, does the same thing, knows EVERYTHING, etc. How boring!
---
I was in a dungeon group last night and they were praising me for being a fire mage because they never see them. It felt damn good.
---
I have also tanked for a long time, I do adjust, I mostly play with PUGs because my rl stops me playing so much and as such I am still leveling up. Obviously you have to try and adjust to the group you find yourself with. I think the ideal solution if that if someone pulls themselves then let them deal with it. But I understand that people have limited time, they want a successful group and if someone is making the group less successful or less fun, well they can take their talents elsewhere. I personally wouldn‚Äôt have just bailed on a group, if it was so bad I would‚Äôve said something. But to say that you don‚Äôt understand why this tank found this frustrating is quite odd to me. It is frustrating

What's wrong with banning people and setting a password on a private channel?

Feelsgood
---
The issue is that there is so much to fix that it is practically an entirely different game. It would be like making Call of Duty play like Counterstrike.
---
It's indeed a feature that was added after vanilla, but it's one of the few changes they made to classic as a compromise, since in classic GMs will never transfer an item from one player to another (whereas in vanilla they would have done that).
---
Yeah you can definitely trade raid loot up to 2 hours.
---
"GoLd iS bIs"
---
Well you wanna stack melees so they share their group wide dmg buffs, so you are left with casters and healers. If you  tell him to mix the healers with casters he would prolly do it. Just something the leader doesn't think about since he is probably a tank warrior.
---
Also MC is so ez it doesn't rly matter.
---
This is exactly why my pw shield button ceases to exist when a warrior is tanking.
---
OP, you're not wrong. That's poor behaviour from an inconsiderate player.
---
Ungoro is amazing for classic/gold/ and skinning if you have it. Felwood is awesome and so is winter spring.  You‚Äôre a hunter you should smoke the levels.  I leveled as a holy priest and I was averaging 5-6 hrs a level from 55 up and I only did dungeons I had quests for
---
&gt;You both ultimately said the same thing.
---
No they didn't. One basically said "I used a level 60-only spec to level with." The other basically said "sm requires 30 points, ruin requires 21 points. That requires level 60. How did you level with a spec that requires level 60?"
---
where is the Screenshot before the run started that the party agreed to loot rules? once again this isnt a ninja lot and it isnt my fault youre to simple to get it.
---
What does being a shaman or hunter have to do with anything? well other than proving you cant think for yourself. which is pretty obvious at this point.
---
This isn't min maxed. This is just thinking you're min maxing for the sake of cleaning up loot. Onslaught is always prior to Fury. If your DPS are pulling threat off of your tanks, you have bigger issues than where the loot is going.
---
If they are decent greens, probably. It isn't all that hard, I specced imp righteous fury which helps although some say it isn't necessary. Your core rotation is usually consecration and seal of wisdom. To pull threat initially or if you are in a jam, you might need to use and judge seal of righteousness sometimes. Holy shield helps with threat and damage mitigation. The trickiest part really is that if your dps opens up before you have time to get threat going, it can be hard to pull it back.
---
Also if your dps pulls like 1 out of 5 mobs from your aoe, don't worry about picking it up too much. If it is a problem for them they can run it back to your aoe or they can just die :)
---
I also have engineering and like using dynamite to pull and do more damage/threat. Very helpful.
---
Probably a wailing caverns run with friends near the end one of my friends got feared off the cliff and instead of falling awkwardly flew and landed on a giant stone pillar instead

Beating a streamer in a 2v2 match. Good times.

Don't argue with him; he's hopeless.

Clever use of game mechanics.

Ooofff, what a twist....

He is talking about junkboxes not lockboxes.
---
I played Blackrock in Classic. Yes it was lol. The server motto was literally "Blackrock is full GTFO" 9k+ Queues and constant crashes if it actually managed to come up.
---
If you are out of quests in this level range you just skipped to many somewhere.  There are more than enough quests to get you to level 60 without grinding.

You are literal scum and people like you should be banned. Bye

Exactly. The game is changed already. People weren't tanking 2H in vanilla. We have 1.12 talents in MC. Item stats on stuff are improved. And layering from the start allowed stockpiling of resources. 
---
We are quite far from #nochanges already
---
Same here
---
A whopping 3g and 7c raised by the hardworking dwarves themselves
---
you lost rallycry? ouch!
---
Patchnotes from the change reads:  
---
  
---
The Burning Crusade Patch 2.3.0 (2007-11-13): Blind is now a physical (no longer a poison) attack. [Reagent] requirement removed. Now shares the same diminish category as  [Cyclone] and is now diminished in PvE as well as PvP.
---
Previously blind was a nature attack like poison.  [Blinding Powder] is now a Grey-quality item ("vendor trash") which can sometimes be found in lockboxes obtained through Pickpocketing. There is a tooltip on the item that explains why Blind no longer needs a Reagent: "Once favored by rogues as a blinding agent, it was abandoned for more readily available resources... like dirt."  
---
It was changed so that it had diminishing returns, which poisons do not. They also made it share DR with Cyclone. Nowhere does it even mention Dwarves. Just like your comment that you deleted, you're wrong man.
---
I'm generally for "all need". There are classes that have many expensive BoEs and classes that barely have any. I main a holy priest and I don't know any BoE or Pattern that's in the game right now that is worth more than a hundred gold. Why should I let a rogue have a 400g Krol Blade when the best thing I could get is an 80g pattern?
---
Other than, everyone rolling greed could result in a group member ninjaing it or in somebody pretending to need the item and then selling it on AH.
---
This is the whiniest community I've ever seen in my goddamn life.
---
Apparently in 2017 it was [35% female](https://www.ibtimes.com/female-wow-players-tell-all-what-world-warcraft-really-them-1999879):
---
&gt;Thirty-five percent of¬†the 7.1 million WoW players¬†are female,¬†according to global market research and predictive analytics firm Newzoo.¬†On average¬†29 percent of women own¬†an¬†MMO game, according to Nielsen.

What about senpaishama ? What happened to him? Is he safe? Is he alright?
---
It‚Äôs 100% possible. I leveled a prot tank from 1-60 from questing and dungeons.
---
You do shit damage but hey you are a good tank! If leveling outside do it with a friend you kill helps show have some Netflix on.

How awesome is this!? Fantastic. That's some brotherhood love right there. Glad you landed yourself in a good guild.

Things can be coded to share DR without changing whether it's Magic, Poison or otherwise. If I'm so wrong, where is your official source stating their reasoning?

LOL you idiots expected Blizztarded developers to do this right.  That was your first mistake.  They will always take the easiest, least costly path.  This isn't Blizzard North.. it is Blizzard Not.
---
I observed this myself as well
---
Yes we can
---
No, it hits the higher threat target(your MT) but your lower threat target takes the threat hit.
---
At the end of phase 2, your MT will have the same threat they had, but the OT will be at 0.
---
Yes, i believe this had to be an intended mechanic for it to work so flawlessly.

Unless they changed DARE to mean "drugs always require education".

Exactly what I was thinking. Azshara fishing. Glass of wine or scotch. Or early morning weekend if I can‚Äôt sleep,  coffee and fish.
---
I absolutely regret rolling mage.  Nearly 17 days played, full pre-BIS, epic mount, archmage robes, maxed out professions, but rolling against 100000x other mages during raids is a major, major downer.  I'm considering giving it all up and rolling something else.  Pure frustration at this point.  Swapping guilds isn't even an option because all guilds that raid during the times I have available are full on mages.  Feels bad.
---
Huge now upgrade for you there normally. Have a look at wowhead and take all the quests.
---
It‚Äôs not that good sadly
---
We do it with a Fury warrior and me as a Ret paladin in healing gear.

As hunter pets only have 300 training points, what should they be spent on? It's not possible to get the highest rank of both great stamina and natural armor, and active abilities cost TP as well. The resistances seem like a trap. And do the skills a pet comes with count towards maximum TP?
---
I loved the facility level!
---
Sgt. Meowanstien, Shitrock, Gary Lazer Eyes, The Purr Monster, Steve French.. Bubbles had such great kitty names

Ahhh, oh goodness, is that how it works? So basically we can have more than 9% hit and be good.

---
in general instance farming just gives way more gold. i think the best way to get gold should be in the world where you have to fight other players. i mean yeah in some small cases if you dominate black lotus spawns and have a crew murding everyone with your mafia that could be good
---
I dont know how it is in your server but in mine there are so few Tanks that most do this shit were they run a dungeon and all non needs are theirs, i've seen a couple who also do that in dungeons where there is an item that they actually need.
---
You can get it from lockboxes no need for an herbalist
---
The secret to leveling fishing is to play alliance and every time you wait for a boat or wait on a boat you fish.  You can get 10 - 20 casts in prior to the boat arriving and you can get about 5 - 8 casts while standing on the boat.
---
Idk, the 0.5 paladin set is like a baby judgement set - it's pretty solid
---
Hey, you forgot the "WTF GUYS I WAS OOM" part if the pull ever goes beyond 30 seconds
---
Yes
---
Just use a manual crowd pummeler for phase 3 and you'll generate threat extremely fast. Did it today in the same gear and had no problems and no wipes.
---
Drain tanking is effectively the same damage output (afaik) while having zero downtime
---
The color changes so fast near sunset and sunrise.
---
Especially when you're essentially putting your own neck on the chopping block if you decide to attempt to heal that DPS and they die anyhow: you're now #1 on the threat list! Congratulations!
---
So accurate. 
---
The problem with mages is that the skill ceiling isn‚Äôt very high. Even a bad player can still do decent damage as a mage. 
---
Lots of them also refuse to drop portals, provide food/water for group members, blame the tank when they nuke the boss and get aggro, then blame the healers when they can‚Äôt keep their squishy asses up.
---
But how much gold was sent?
---
\&gt; Or worse yet, healer burns all his mama  
---
plz healers dont burn all your mamas
---
destroy hearth, go to "character stuck" and use "teleport to nearest graveyard"
---
If you use weakauras and get some of the premade setup from [wag.io](https://wag.io) you can have your hotbars fade as well leaving you with just cooldowns. You can get a few UI mods that will only show health/resource if they are deficient or while in combat so that you can have a clear view when you arent fighting or have debuffs on you.

The leveling grind is real. My main is still only 34. I don't have a ton of time to play but I'm also not in a big rush.
---
Seventy ni....
---
I am one of the people OP described, I don't have time to raid and I find ovo fun but I dont think I have time to commit to a pvp guild or anything. The 0.5 gear is a good side tracking thing to do and would give me a bit of fear I'd otherwise be lacking.
---
The stats on shaman T1 are worse than prebis so no shaman is going to buy a BOE for 500g unless it's the last piece that they're missing. 
---
And if it's the last piece they're missing they're at the point where they could just get it the next MC run anyway
---
Lol ...not sure which is worse:
---
Getting triggered by a joke or worrying about being down voted.
---
I switched about 40. I ended up still using my VW though, succ was quicker killing single target but VW I found was quicker to handle multiple mobs and ended up more efficient for me.

That's the because the animation doesn't always play when using a trap. I can pretty reliably spam them without giving it away lol.

Honestly, we need like a book or something of everyone's stories of their one fun night in Classic. It's things like this that stop me from doing what I was going to go do and then 5 minutes later I'm sitting here catching myself typing up stupid shit on Reddit because I'm in love with the story. 
---
I believe we need some kind of system to store these things because these kind of stories are what make me wanna log on and play.
---

---
Jeez... My favorite memory is probably how silly I was when I was younger. My first character was a small gnome rogue with brilliant combed over hair to hide my slowly fading hairline. I must've been level 22 or so when I first heard the term "twink". Not knowing much about the game I dove right into it, thinking: "yeah, I'm a twink because I'm a rogue". Yeah... No. I got absolutely demolished in all kinds of PVP.
---
  But I was stubborn. I asked other people for tips, I checked plenty of "twink videos", most with the same dumb song "let the bodies hit the floor". Eventually, I did get better in the PVP aspect of the game but I still had no bis-gear for being a "twink" which still meant that I was still getting demolished by, well... Everyone. 
---
I ended up creating a new gnome rogue with a "better" name, thinking this will be my new twink, this gon be the one. Don't even think I passed level 5. Pretty sure I still have them somewhere...
---
Exactly. Thinking you deserve BoE loot more than anyone else in the group is the definition of greed. Very selfish. Everyone should have a fair shot at it since they all put in equal time to earn it. Don't get salty because you had an equal shot at the item and got unlucky.
---
VW tank capability sucks but if you pull two, he can offtank one if you don‚Äôt super DoT it. Drain tank one with an amp curse rolling on VW target then dot and drain tank it when VW loses aggro
---
Just keep him as an emergency offtank &amp; shield fodder if it really hits the fan

Does anyone know if ghetto namechange works? where i delete a character, someone takes my name, and then i restore the character?
---
I'm doing something similar where I have a character of every class, except my approach is different. Leveled my Mage to 60 and had been leveling my other characters only until I used up their rested xp. Now I'm focusing on leveling my Rogue/Warrior/Warlock and only doing rested xp for the others.

Subtlety Rogue more viable in raids.
---
0.5 is overpowered for rogues only.
---
Maybe I'm bugged where I am.  I log out and wake up in the morning and all the Soul Shards I have (NOT stones or conjured items) are GONE.  :(  
---
The ticketing system is busted now, too.... \*\*sigh\*\*
---
&gt;Would you guys recommend I respec now? And focus on getting gear from grinding dungeons.
---
You'll be fine as shadow in all the 5/10 man dungeons. 
---
You will likely need to resepc for MC, most guilds prefer holy/disc at this point.
---
&gt;Or should I keep solo leveling as shadow until 60, before focusing on pre-raid BiS?
---
A combination of both, you can get a fair bit of BiS in BRD and you should have no problems healing there as shadow as long as your tank isn't more than 2-3 levels under the boss.
---
&gt;Also - When I do respec for healing, how would you recommend I distribute my points to be the best possible raid priest?
---
Talk to the priests in your guild, find out what build(s) they have and fill and gaps or go with what they have.
---
Oh okay, so everyone rolled greed on a BoE and he thought "well fuck me they're giving it to me!  How kind!"
---
No.
---
Keep lying to yourself because youre a shit person with a shit sense of morality and a shit set of behavioral patterns.
---
Im sorry that you believe that this shit is acceptable on any level, but it makes me glad that as I saw toxicity in this sub rise, I knew WoW Classic would never have the community it once did.
---
Say your peace, because im not responding to your ignorant bullshit anymore.
---
Yeah I looked up the pre raid bis for hunters. Devilsaur are the best pants even without the bonus. So even though trueaim are way better alone, the free 2% hit with the gauntlets set makes them pretty even.
---
I think that person thinks Drowning Pool/Soil/Disturbed *are* death metal
---
More importantly, wait for the proc to use AR/BF on a st boss fight. Rag is &lt;2 min, so I wait for zeal and 1-2 crusaders to proc then AR/BF. Knowing I'll get the full 15s window of uptime. Preferably after a wrath of rag ofc.

Yea they brag about blizzard success with classic but don't realize the success is because new and old people are subbing again. Which means we need Sherpas. If we meet with toxcity we won't play. I work too damn much to spend time looking for a group to just shit on me. Get enough of that at work.

I got you fam. When the Classic beta rolled out I decided to commit to playing a Warlock, did a bunch of reading on the topic and played around with different builds. I'm playing a Warlock now and its been an absolute blast. Simply put, there are two major approaches to leveling a Warlock: VW tanking and Drain Tanking. We'll cover these in turn, but first let's talk about the basics.
---
**The fundamentals**
---
1. Health matters. The #1 most important thing to remember is that your health and mana are an interchangeable pool of resources. Health = Mana. Mana = Health. If your mana is low, you can refill it using Life Tap (and later Dark Pact) or by not casting/wanding for &gt;5 seconds. If your health is low, you can refill it via Healthstones, Drain Life, bandages, Cannibalize, etc. If both are low, then you can eat and drink at the same time, or just let them regenerate over time as you run to your next objective. Speaking of time...
---
2. Time matters. The #2 most important thing to remember is that time is your only true currency. You can always convert time into health and mana. To illustrate the point, imagine if Shadowbolt, an awfully mana-inefficient spell, cost 5 times as much mana and did 5 times as much damage than it does now. Would you use it? Yes you would, to the exclusion of everything else. Even if you ran yourself bone dry after 3 mobs and had to drink, you would more than make up for that drinking time in faster kill speed. That's how mages work, with their high DPS spells and free water. Speaking of DPS...
---
3. In the end, everything comes down to DPS averaged across the many hours of leveling. Warlocks rely almost entirely on stacking multiple low DPS / high mana efficiency spells and effects, trying to play for time while minimizing resource loss in the process. Everything in your kit and every talent point you spend is dedicated to optimizing those exchange rates. 
---
**Some basic tricks**
---
1. Watch the 5-second rule. Whether you're in combat or not, if you haven't spent mana in the last 5 seconds, you'll start regenerating it at a full rate. Because so much of Warlock damage is front-loaded with quick/instant DoTs, wanding for damage while you wait for them to tick is a big part of your kit. Resist the urge to sneak in a random cast here and there. Spend mana in bursts. 
---
2. Wands are an immensely important source of damage for you until about 40, where Drain Life catches up and overtakes it. 
---
3. Some DoTs take so long to deliver their damage, they might not be worth casting, especially in early levels. Immolate + Corruption + Wand is a very simple rotation that is cheap and probably the highest DPS you can reliably dish out until mid-30's, provided you get [this OP wand ASAP](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7001/gravestone-scepter). 
---
4. Don't worry about keeping yourself topped off. A huge part of WoW leveling is running from spot to spot. Let your natural regen tick while on the move. Stam/sprit gear (of the whale) is your friend until around 40, where +Shadow Damage begins to overtake everything.
---
**Void Walker tanking**
---
So with the above fundamentals in mind, why is it a good idea to have a VW tank for us? What does that give us? Why don't we just open up with an Imp, load the mob up with dots and then facetank it while we wand it to death, like we did before level 10? We're not afraid of dying to a single mob, right? The answer is that facetanking costs health, which is equal to mana, which lowers our damage/mana, which ultimately lowers our DPS. Having the VW taking hits for us opens up another resource, their health and mana, that we can spend instead of our own health and mana to fight. The problem, as you have found out, is that the VW can't hold that threat forever.  So what do we do?
---
We could try to keep our threat below the VW. It generates the certain amount of threat per second, which effectively creates a cap on the amount of DPS we can do. For starters, we can spend talent points on Impr. VW, which buffs their main aggro ability, Torment, by 30% thereby upping our own damage ceiling. We can also open with CoA and Corruption, allowing the VW to build up aggro and only then, after the second Torment, throw in an Immolate and a talented Drain Soul. This will keep aggro on the VW until the mob dies and the Impr. DS proc will nicely top off our mana over the next few seconds. The build for it would look [something like this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IAMZbxhz).
---
Lots of Warlocks do this and it's very easy. The problem is that it's also slow. The VW does very little damage and we end up throttling our own DPS to the point where the above example of just going all out with dots, an Imp/Succubus pet and wanding, then drinking/eating actually ends up being faster in the long term.  
---
So what else? We can do the above, but instead of throttling our DPS we simply accept that the VW will lose aggro at some point. Even if it only holds it for 50% of the mob's health, that's still 50% of the time that mob is not eating our face, costing us health = mana = DPS. In line with our fundamentals, that's a win. Can we be even more efficient? Sure we can:
---
1. Once the VW loses aggro, we don't really need it to keep hitting the same mob in futile attempts to regain aggro with its crap damage. We can actually send it over to the next mob to start building aggro on it, while we finish off this one. Depending on hold long that takes, we can really open up on the second mob, since the VW will have solid aggro by then.
---
2. If mobs have room to run around, we can also fear the first mob, since feared mobs do 0 damage, then stack the second mob with CoA + Corruption while we wait for the first mob to run back to us. This is an efficiency gain, since we're doing more DPS for basically no extra cost to our health. 
---
3. If we're feeling particularly ballsy, we can even load up a third mob with a full set of DoTs, then fear it. This will send the first, almost dead, mob back to us to finish, while we have DoTs ticking on second mob (aggro on VW) and third mob (running around feared). This is the covered VW + Fear juggle and when it works, it's super efficient and you feel like a god. When it fails, you can use the VW's AoE taunt to gather things up, then Sacrifice it for a shield (both buffed by the Impr. VW talent) to clean up the mess. 
---
The problem is that past level 40 or so, the VW begins to struggle with mana issues and threat even with talent investments, while mobs health and damage continues to scale up. This means that mistakes begin to get more costly, while the overall kill speed goes down. Plus, you will always be missing out on potential pet damage, of which VW has none. So what do we do? Well, starting at around lvl 40, we tank stuff ourselves!
---
**Drain tanking**
---
The fundamental approach is to lean into the basic pre-10 rotation I described above. Take a high damage pet, like the Succubus (because the Imp runs out of mana), throw on some DoTs and then blast the mob in the face with either a Wand (early on) or Drain Life (post level 30/38). Your talents (like Fel Concentration) and gear choices (prioritizing Stamina and Shadow Damage above all else) then align with making this exchange more efficient. Early on, you are looking at something like [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IA0bVo), which then transitions into [Dark Pact build](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IA0wVRboVo) and then into whatever else you want from there on your way to 60 (for example [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IA0iVRboVobZxx0t)).
---
The main approach here is to optimize primarily for the single mob rotation. You can still get cheeky with fears or the Succubus tanking a hit here and there, but overall, you just want to load the mob up with dots, Life Tap once, then drain it to death. Bandage up when you get low and just keep on truckin'.

That's not a true statement.. Bagthief makes ridiculous claims, but I have made gold off of summons.. maybe 2-3 times since my characters existence... lol

.... why not spirit res and hearth?
---
Way too much banter in our guild for anything like this, however our GM is honestly one of the finest leaders of people I've ever encountered, i would follow that man to hell
---
For example:  we had an issue while trying to do split ony.  Due to someone already being locked in the raid group, about 10 people were unable to do onyxia as they also got locked to that id.  Just as people were beginning to question what had happened, our GM stepped in and shouldered the blame and said "its our fault for not checking" and he made the decision to run 1 raid and for the others to try and get people for a pug if they could
---
Instead of descending into a witch hunt or some bad feelings, he took responsibility even though it wasn't his fault, and it instantly defused the situation and resolved it with no bad feelings.  People like this are fucking rare
---
geez the guy made an honest mistake. you don't need to write some cringy essay to make yourself feel superior.

But yea the average Paladin is probably doing a 2 or 3 button rotation.
---
Took me ages to figure out I needed a whole new set to do ZF farming lol. That and dancing just out of melee range were the two hardest things about the farm.
---
Would you really say lasher farming is chill? I tried it several times and absolutely hated it lol. The patrols made me feel constantly on edge and any mistake was death with a sad run back to your corspe. Of course, this happens with ZF too but at least there's an easily accessible safe spot you can usually always get to. There isn't one of those for lashers (that I'm aware of).
---
Lasher farming is by far better than ZF farming due to the fact that higher boes can drop. The learning curve for it was far steeper than the ZF one though.
---
I never sold gold but I get it. I'd be too afraid of selling accounts on a server ran by blizzard.

Anybody happen to know?

Might want to mention if you‚Äôre horde or alliance! I play horde on Faeralina and let me know if you have questions!
---
I dont even know what else 0.5 dungeon sets would bring, drop The price of BoE tier 1, bring extra bosses to dungeons with massive Loot, give classes new BiS list and you'd make me get new dueling gear
---
Well either they are valuable and you need to prevent ninjas, or they aren't valuable and OP has really nothing to complain about because well the book is cheap af anyway.
---
Ohhhhhh yeahhhhh lets get a nice enchant on it and make it really look like a Runeblade! I think +9 would look the best and be most in line with Runeblades but to each his own!

I hear you can just get a bunch of people to report your name and you can get it changed pretty quickly. I haven't heard of what you said
---
How do you determine the price for really rare stuff? I recently got a good purple bow that I can't use, but have no idea how to price it. Similarly I got a pattern for greater intelligence on bracers that I might use eventually, but I figure it's better turned into gold and spent on an epic mount.  Tips?
---
Lol how is that weird?
---
Biggest advice I can give is tell the rest of the raid to stand in the tanking position if they get aggro. This way onyxia doesn't spin around and tailswipe/firebreath the whole raid so that once you do finally build enough threat to stabilize you will still have enough of the raid alive to finish her off. Some deaths in the phase 3 transition are almost expected.

The WoW Classic launch was the Dark Souls of MMO launches.

Why not? That's why. Why even comment about it?

for all the arcanite reaper haters: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8KDzuR3txI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8KDzuR3txI)

The trees, the style of fence and yes, the clothes line.
---
Manual crowd pummelers
---
I'm also on arcanite reaper, and though I wouldn't say it's dead by any means, you can definitely feel the low population. It is pretty hard to sell/buy some things on the AH, and the lower-level zones are pretty empty. I saw someone in Barrens chat trying to grouo for WC and there were only 3 people in WC level range in Barrens... I doubt he found a group lol
---
They're all shadowmelded so you can't see them.
---
Getting none stop ganked in stv
---
Never put +dmg on off hand
---
I loved this. Lok‚ÄôTar Ogar!
---
I doubt its that high for classic tho. Probably 90%dudes or higher
---
This is classic
---
They sure did. There should be no batching at all. Just crisp reactions to commands
---
You think you do, but you don't.
---
This cuts deep
---
I dont know why someone would be so stingy about not being able to sell a DM book on the AH.
---
On the other hand, i would probably ask if i could need it to give to my wife. Not just need it without the groups consent.
---
If you YouTube wow memorials there are several created for fans and developers hidden all over. Sad video. RIP
---
That's ducks
---
I see...I mean, I don't...
---
It's worse than anything you can get in molten core.   
---
For an Orc I'd say it's even worse than Arcanite Reaper - a crafted blue.  
---
Fun meme sword, not that good though.
---
i have the large seafourium, have yet to try it. unfortunately it doesnt work on the viewing room door in scholomance, i remember being able to do that for gandling jump runs. but i guess it was changed at some point so this version of classic doesnt have it
---
The respawn time is about 5 mins so it doesnt do any damage sadly
---
Yes you will because clearly your triggered and like the rest of the people on your side you cower when facts slap around your pathetic self imposed rules,the only thing thats toxic is the entitled babies like you demanding others play on your terms and the daily posts crying when the world doesnt bow to you.
---
Yeah I can see people who think this still feels like 2006, if their internet back then was two cans attached with a long string.
---
Spot on:D Nobody here played Undertale?
---
They‚Äôre selling for 70% more on my server.  Farmed 10 and threw me up on AH and not a single one sold :(
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure they added it in BC
---
Yeah. Not amazing items but maybe its not the biggest or wealthiest guild. Its the thought that counts for sure! :)
---
And pallys
---
Bliz got our servers running from 2004 give ‚Äòem a break
---
This is why EVERYONE should roll need.
---
Also me when I jump over the ravine in Wailing Caverns without dismissing the pet.

---
I crafted the death Ray trinket and honestly I'm a bit disappointed. I thought I was going to get 1k plus damage all the times but I mostly hit 700 to 800. I think only once u got close to 2k. Idk some times I feel like it's a waste if a trinket slot
---
Its an on case basis for reporting to gms. I'm not saying 100% he would be punished I'm just saying its what I would do. Its a lame way to play but to each their own.
---
Yet u still bitch about it and here you are still subbing
---
All you need to do is separate the mobs from each other or get one mob to hit him.
---
I mean technically yes, it's "going back" but its not really going back.
---
The game now simply doesn't have the same vibe that kept us in Vanilla. Gamers have changed too.
---
There's no going back to what we remember.
---
The range on track hidden is still super small though... I use it to find stealthed mobs (e.g. kill X of these stealthed mobs) and they're still practically on top of me by the time I see them // by the time the red dot appears on the map.  Does the range get better or worse depending on the level gap between you and the stealthed unit or what?
---
Lmfao IKR. He's targeting clothies in raid gear that are semi afk lol.
---
why wouldnt it? you see those who raid during other things during the week.a lot of raides means a healthy pop during the rest of time pretty much by d√©faut.
---
A lot of hunters level MM
---
It‚Äôs fine if everyone agrees. That‚Äôs why you ask first. I think he meant that most people would just say yeah it‚Äôs fine unless someone really needed it.
---
Stay pissed
---
How do you know what can exist out there if you‚Äôve never seen it first hand. Hopefully my guild will be nice. Had to choose between two buds for servers. Both are pvp but stinks pinking one over the other
---
This is a pointless argument cause we are talking about classic hunter which is really easy compared to playing druid well
---
Yeah pre 40 mail is very str heavy, it‚Äôs made assuming a warrior will wear it. Mail after 40 becomes a lot more diverse since the assumption is that warriors will move on to plate.
---
The longest fight in mc should be around 2 min 30 seconds. An extra 400 ish mana doesn't mean nearly as much as like 80 plus healing.
---
and you also lose having 56 int, 37 stam, 27 spirit, and 3mana/5.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
but sure, gain 30sp. you do 0 zero dps when dead and too many people blindly read this stuff and do it and then wonder why they die so often with 2k life at 60. 
---
raids are not dps checks (at least not during p1). min/maxing is a an issue for people who blindly read these lists and it makes it a problem for everyone.
---
It's so strange, on my server all the other caster books and epic robe patterns are pretty cheap. I've seen the books go for &lt;10g and the patterns are generally 30g.
---
Priest shit, book is 200g and epic robe pattern is 500g.
---
Definitely a low pop server!
---
I tried that with a friend the other day but it said his name was taken when I tried to create a char with his name. How long did it take for the name to open up?
---
Or weed.
---
It depends on when you're on. In the middle of the night there is usually just you there or maybe one more but yea mid day is not worth it
---
Un-canon fanfiction.
---
Well you can use the strength juju
---
It was a great farm until ~3 weeks ago some asshole made a video about it on youtube, ppl on this sub keep talking about it and all the idiots started to farm there. It's at least 5 times the amount of people farming those now at any given time. It only took me 2 minutes to see that it's completely worthless now. Farming Qia with 3 people standing there is more g/h now.
---
If someone is needing stuff for money that other group members want as an upgrade I'd tell them to fuck off and solo it if they want to act like that. He wants to act like the big dog because he's 10 levels higher than the rest of the group, but the reality is he isnt capable of soling it efficiently yet, he's just using you to help him farm
---
It doesn‚Äôt happen much but it‚Äôs the few times it does happen it REALLY sticks with ya. I‚Äôm only level 40 but it‚Äôs happened probably 5 times to me. And I can recall every single time it‚Äôs happened perfectly. It‚Äôs that engraved into my mind.
---
My guild blows kisses.
---
I‚Äôm actually nice guy. An Optometrist by nature.
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs crazy to think he‚Äôs at the age to have a wife or not, it‚Äôs whether he actually has a wife that also plays the game and is already max level and also cares about pre bis for raiding
---
Which of the smileys I used made you think I was upset, the :D or the :3? ^^
---
That‚Äôs true... I didn‚Äôt think of that, during the times I‚Äôm able to play its pretty busy. But that‚Äôs okay, I‚Äôll save my mage for later.
---
We talking pve or PvP when phase 3 hits
---
weightstones work?
---
Yeah, generally I haven't done that or felt the need to. But I never know when I'm going to pug with some trigger happy dps.
---
I always politely explain why I don't want cheap shot on pull or aoe before I've had some swipes.. stuff like that
---
Getting to the point where people are familiar with 60 dungeons and there's less babysitting to do
---
That was a good video, short and sweet, i didnt know distract could counter like that!
---
That‚Äôs ok, because everyone hates mages.
---
Does pickpocketing trigger the global CD? If not then yeah a macro to pickpocket before a backstab or garrote would be dope.
---
Probably the first time going to RFC. 
---
I was a child at the time, and the idea of going to a dungeon was so scary and exciting at the time.
---
What fishing add on is that?
---
Must not being doing it right, made myself more than 100g in 3 days.
---
Forget farming, I can‚Äôt even quest properly now. Seriously i had to wait until off peak hours to do some quests in STV/Feralas. I even had to get a group going for the bloody zanil quests in STV. Yes, a full group to kill some normal mobs just so we had a better chance of tagging them before other players do.
---
Yeah I love mages that pull like 5 mobs when the healer is half mana and i am tank and just arrrrrrgg
---
You should have seen it before, but it's still a work in progress :D
---
Nah man, it‚Äôs not the ‚Äúlol go faster‚Äù it‚Äôs the blatant disrespect. Catering to the dickheads only tells them they can get away with it. Sure the rest of the group suffered but you can‚Äôt insult people like that man. DPS, healer, tank, we‚Äôre all trying to have fun. You are, I am, OP is.
---
/moo
---
Another annoying theme on this subreddit is the ‚ÄúI just let them die‚Äù healer...this person doesn‚Äôt exist in game. 
---
Not to mention, carrying your group with clutch heals is praised. 
---
Groups rarely are made up of all the same skill levels. It‚Äôs on the people who are better at the game to carry the others, whether this is to a small or large extent varies. 
---
If you only want to play with people at your level, whatever that is, you need a tight knit group of friends or a guild...few guilds will strive for mediocrity though.
---
No, prison runs. Like 80k+ xp/hr at lvl 54 no competition
---
I sold a decent chunk of thorium right after the DM announcement, and I actually lost out on some money compared to selling it now. And my server is still layered
---
I‚Äôm confused. Couldn‚Äôt you just take the zep to UC from STV as a ghost?
---
I‚Äôm bias to hunters, as I‚Äôm mainly a solo player so the extra help from a pet helps. Also I‚Äôve read that it‚Äôs the easiest to level quickly (idk I‚Äôve only been a hunter and rogue but the rogue is just a bank alt). Though it‚Äôs really easy to be bad at being a hunter, it‚Äôs also really easy to be a good hunter. All-in-all, for dps, Hunter is fun lol.
---
Dang all my guild has done was label me a ‚Äúneedy bitch‚Äù after asking for help with the warrior quest.
---
Little bit of both, I want to try and do raids but also try and do a small bit of pvp here and there
---
I grabbed Philcollins
---
Is there a way to get threat plates to stack? I use the option in interface, but it only stacks normal name plates not ones in threat mode.
---
No one is saying classic is dead. 
---
No one cares.
---
This is written like someone who‚Äôs only ever read about tanking
---
This just isn't logical, and hear me out. If you are a good person, you should need on all BoE's 100% of the time. If you are greeding you are saying that you don't need the BoE and that someone else in your group likely needs it more, and you want them to have it. So your options are greeding it and leaving it up to chance that the other members will do the right thing, or you can need it and if you win you can trade it to the person who actually needs the item. You are giving them a higher chance of getting the item and ninja looters a lower chance of getting the item.
---
Walking from Ironforge to Shadow fang keep at level 20 something with 4 other people who hadn't done it in forever, and  running like crazy to sneak around horde players xD
---
What the hell? If your hitting 40 in 1 day 18 hours please take a screenshot that‚Äôs amazingly fast
---
How is it pointless when you brought up that Wotlk Hunter is easy. So your whole comment is pretty much pointless.
---
I can't wait until I'm high enough level to tame Brokentooth and name him SteveFrench
---
My friend asked nicely to our guild leader if there would be another raid group at any point. What he got as a response is a paragraph of him basically saying no, I don‚Äôt care about people that haven‚Äôt already gotten to 60 and aren‚Äôt min maxing/playing non-casually. Said there‚Äôs no time for that drama and said he doesn‚Äôt care how we spend our $16/month but basically either find a different guild or get fucked. 
---
Also had another friend ask for an invite when our guild was merging with theirs, they were getting ready to raid and instead of just adding him he sent two messages saying now is not the time and to not bother him. 
---
The dude sucks. As a first time wow player it feels pretty bad knowing that my guild is only concerned with players good enough for them. I‚Äôm a pretty casual player so hopefully I can find a welcoming guild once I hit 60. For now I‚Äôm not super concerned with it though.
---
Ya you sure seem like a real fucking gem
---
Only because you mentioned playing one
---
i know many who didnt raid but wanted to at least see the raids for themselves without having to watch videos of others. LFR was perfect for them. they may not have wanted to raid every week, but they wanted to at least see the new raids.
---
I would give the same advices, but wouldn't recommend prot impale build at all.
---
The bonus threat from bleed and impale are almost non existent and it cost a lot of talent point .
---
(People from the fight club discord took a look at the number and with a generous amount of criticism chance around 40%, extra treat from this build compared to deep prot was less than 2%. Tried it myself, not impressed at all)
---
Hard to say but good private servers had thousands online at one moment. And literally hundreds at one place. Still worked..
---
I don‚Äôt ever even want burning crusade.
---
Lightning shield, flame shock, searing totem. Those are the only 3 spells you should regularly use on enhance. One lesser heal after the fight and keep going. Slow and steady.
---
Laughs in nature's swiftness
---
rofl, nice walk back. pathetic.
---
Getting Rank 13 in vanilla.
---
I‚Äôve tried like 3 hunters and it doesn‚Äôt seem like the class for me, I‚Äôm kind of a lazy player lol
---
But there is literally zero downside to doing what they suggested. The only people you are hurting by needing a BoE and trading it to the person who actually needs it are people who are trying to ninja it. And despite what you've seen, it happens enough that doing everything to prevent it is only logical.
---
Totally up to you and what you are planning on doing.  I stayed shadow until 58, but if I were to do it again, I'd just level shadow to 60.
---
One of easiest ways to level is to join BRD Arena/anger/golem runs (make sure those fuckers do golem for trinket).  You can farm a couple of nice drops and it's really easy to do as shadow from 54+ (maybe even earlier if you got a decent tank).  On my server, these runs are going all the time for the HOJ/Cloth belt farmers.
---
Also, this depends on server, but we had some many healers LFG that it was really tough to find dungeon groups pre-60.  If you have a healer-stared server, I'd respec at 56 and just run dungeons for gear.
---
Pretty sure lasher farm is only better than ZF if you're killing satyrs as well.
---
I‚Äôve gotten full aoe groups while levelling (paladin warlock mage me(hunter)) and also full gogogo groups (Druid warrior rogue me(hunter)) and I have to say... 1 is not clearly faster than the other lol.
---
Cause the pulls are small and the single target is good the healer hardly dips low mana. Heck the one drinking the most is me lol.
---
There's a classic plus sub for alternate releases.
---
I'm hoping they do classic plus personally, small updates that fill in zones they had originally planned to do but never finished.
---
I would be lucky to see a quarter of that many horde on my server in orgrimmar.
---
I ate seven solo fireballs last onyxia attempt, tank ate none.
---
Man wow what a let down of a spell :/
---
&gt;is it wrong for a non-raid item to be better than a raid item?
---
&gt;
---
&gt;The t0.5 sets take more effort to acquire than T1. Why is it not ok for some pieces to be better than t1?
---
I have no opinion either way. All I know is I will be rocking 4 piece 0.5t all the way through naxx like I did in the past.
---
Shaman isn't terrible in raids. Like ele isn't the BEST but it isn't terrible. 
---
In pvp, however, both ele and enhance are fun as fuck
---
Mages are the new huntards.
---
Why is it dumb? I need money. Again, where do you draw the line? 20g? 50g? Tell me.
---
I roll greed on stuff I don't need. That's the entire point. But hey, sure, I'm 15 and I'm mad. You're a champ at arguing.
---
If you don't have epic mount money, sell.
---
But what if the 500 gold from a freezing band buys a world drop boe bis for a different person who rolls it? I say that as a frost mage. If something that expensive drops, need it. It's disingenuous to say you don't need 500 gold.
---
Int, spirit and mp5 only matter if you're going oom. And even in full dps gear you're still sitting at 3k hp buffed. That should be enough to take a hit in MC and live, provided you and the healers are paying attention. But yeah, it's a minor optimization that's not necessarily required.
---
As a healer i almost never need to drink between pulls if no one is getting hit except the tank. It‚Äôs really only when you need to heal everyone that the mana gets low.
---
I got sooo lucky with mine. First ever arena run. Second time ever even seeing Gorosh. All my luck since has been trash.
---
WARLOCK
---
Check "abap from faerlina" On YouTube h√© made √† short vid√©o on gold you can expect from solo jump run and there's even math in it
---
Most != all.
---
I just feel like that stat upgrade would be such a waste to sell, am I wrong?
---
I respecd at 54. About 4/5ths of xp to 60 was dungeons, fairly quickly too (around 5 to 6 hours per level). 
---
I hit 60 on Sunday and I'm already in 2/3rds BiS or near BiS. MC and Ony attuned. 
---
Priests are fine a dozen. Seriously, way more played now than vanilla. The way to get ahead imo is spec holy and get well geared.
---
Btw...holy nova is some fuxking fun.
---
30/0/21 is best shaman spec imo. I switched to it at 40.
---
By the time I hit 52 I started running dungeons for nothing but gear and hit 60 without any issues.
---
I wouldnt Respec until you're ready to raid so you don't have to limit yourself to dungeon grinding. Not that it is impossible to do things in a healing spec, but it is funner in my opinion to play shadow as much as possible.
---
Imagine being so toxically obtuse you feel entitled to something you cant equip.
---
Neckbeards gonna neckbeard.
---
Weapon is a stat stick for hunters, this weapon provides no stats. A green lvl 10 of the monkey would probably be better on average
---
Honestly I wear my healing gear with spellpower pieces swapped in.  if you do the rock strafing technique properly she won't ever hit you with boulder because you can LOS it on the small rock.  If you're tauren watch out for your hitbox radius though.
---
POCKET SAND! Sha Sha SHAWW
---
Everyone has the same use for it. It is worth x amount of gold. That x gold can be x item. A freezing band dropping is the exact same thing as edgemasters dropping.
---
In that scenario I would suck up to the tank for him to not leave and kick the mage instead.
---
Why clear the whole courtyard though?
---
FFS we get it... jeeze. Games not dead... shit. We all know that already.
---
Come back in 6 months, maybe then it will be an accomplishment if these numbers hold.
---
That said, people who betted on one month... lowballing it pretty hard...
---
My absolute lowest, unfair estimate for how long things last would be 4-5 months. Realistically I will say give it a year. This depends what blizzard plans for post Nax level content though. Releasing BC Classic might reinvigorate the player base like Classic did. Releasing shelved raids.
---
That said im told that Private servers still have their patrons and have economies that are solid enough for gold farmers to operate on. So I don't know, Classic might never die completely. I do see it making a decline once the content has been tapped out.
---
No i dont think i will
---
Every loot council ive seen funnels gear to officers.
---
Depends if they only log on for raids.
---
get mad warrior
---
 Honestly the reason they do it is probably because a large number of dwarves don‚Äôt know stoneform works versus blind.
---
Tyyyrt
---
I enjoyed the month I had it almost to myself. Now I'm lucky to get a pool. Oh well!
---
That isn't the point. The point is what the default behavior is, and if you do your "need on all BoE epics" thing without informing people that you are doing that ahead of time, you are going to be seen as a Ninja looter. Just type the one sentence in chat and be clear.
---
Is the Recipe for Enchant Shield - Lesser Block still rare?
---
No
---
Got my nemisis this week after 10 more runs lmao
---
In this stage of clsssic there is almost nothing to do exept farming so gold is not very important if you are a good player, we get tons of gold from all the shit we do anyway. If you need anything, farm it. And wait for raid once a week
---
If there's one thing I learned, it's that MC is so mindlessly easy, you just stack +healing gear, downrank Flash Heal, and pad your meters.
---
Things will get a bit harder in BWL and onward though, but it wasn't really that hard.  People these days will crush the content.
---
Didnt know either! Did Onyxia yesterday and got asked to DE an warlock t2 helm. Got 2 Large brilliant shards from it. Having de'd a lot of items in vanilla i knew it almost certainly would have given Nexus so i felt like a really bad disenchanter, afraid someone would accuse me of having disenchanted a blue from my inventory.
---
Literally impossible to please. So In a way I'm sure it's nice for Blizz, not much reason to beupset in their shoes if you know you can't make them happy. Imagine the shitshow if Blizz listened to tons of people and didn't use sharding, game would have literally been impossible to play. Only short term solution would have been to make tons more servers only for them all to die off like twice as fast as the regular ones.
---
thanks man! &lt;3 first nice comment on reddit haha
---
If you have to resort to abusing drugs to enjoy a GAME, maybe it's time to stop playing...
---
Luckily OP is a warrior... üòú
---
Lol
---
If orc yes
---
What I'd recommend is to get a friend and two-man things.
---
Practice marking targets, pulling via Moonfire, simply charging and trying to LOS pull a caster behind something.
---
Once you're comfy with that, put together a Stamina set (for Bear tanks, +hit &gt; Sta &gt; Agi &gt; Str, and I assume you've got a bunch of Agility cat stuff) and run something easy like Uldaman. Tell the DPS you're a new tank :)
---
This is the correct way to do things.
---
It‚Äôs the opposite! You have so much power as a tank that you can randomly leave and get another group instantly.
---
my gf doesnt really care what we do. I understand that I'm biased horde, but I understand that both sides have bad people. In my experience, though, I've met so many more bad people. I've met shit people on horde too, just not nearly as often.
---
I wanna play the other faction but again I feel so invested into my own character.
---
I loved everything about goldeneye. I‚Äôm 31 and those were my golden days of gaming. Don‚Äôt get me started with the multiplayer.

---
There's no real right answer, Robes of Insight are a pretty good item for level 42, but at 60 there are many more options that are much better for you so you will likely replace them if you choose to equip it.
---
You can put it on the AH and get like 50-100g (That's what it goes for on my server) to help with your epic mount, alternatively you can equip it and use it which will help you in a lot of encounters.
---
Personally I'd equip em, as a warlock your mount is much cheaper (Especially if you use another warlock's reagents) and 50-100g isn't too much at level 60 (It's still a fair bit). Having a cool, rare robe that you found is a satisfying feeling especially when you hang onto it for a while.
---
I use a pickpocket/garrote macro and it works great. Sometimes you don't get the loot before your next move triggers but you just have to loot the corpse twice after you kill it.
---
You‚Äôre oblivious if you don‚Äôt know the difference between 100+ gold boe‚Äôs and bop items.
---
This is my first time playing wow, I made a tank, and then made a mage. 
---
I‚Äôve now seen both sides of these situations. 
---
Nothing pissed me off more, than when a dps did this while I tanked. Tanking requires so much more energy and straining, compared to the other 2 roles by a mile. My tank was a prot warrior, with all the talents that helped build more threat. Still was quite a lot of clicking to hold threat. 
---
Then I made a mage. Knowing how hard it is to tank, I knew exactly what I needed to do to make life easy for my tanks. But then I started matching with 2h warrior tanks. Holy shit, these dudes pull so much aggro and compete with dps on dps meters. The difference in aggro from 2h warriors to prot warriors with sword and shield was night and day. 
---
Every now and then, I get matched with tanks who remind me, of me when I was tanking. Low damage, weak aggro, and then often entitled frustration when criticized. 
---
I can‚Äôt believe I wasted so much time being a shitty tank when 2h dps warriors were clearly superior tanks. 
---
Druid tanks are great too. Just anything but a sword and shield prot tank.
---
I actually think it is sometimes.
---
It's like those eye collection quests, where the person designing the quest remembered That they should always have eyes.
---
Actually wondering if these quests are better or worse that those hooveless zevrah quests. That one in the barrens, 
---
"get me 4 zevrah hooves!"
---
 "Cool, so I just need to kill one!"
---
"LOL you crack me up kid! just kill one he says! Think again sunshine..."
---
I feel your pain here.
---
Opportunity cost
---
I mean of course I've met assholes on horde, they exist everywhere. I just dont remember people being so mean so commonly over there. Maybe it's bias, but I don't think it is because I went into Alliance with an open mind.
---
Ahhhh. 
---
It may help to read 1.12 as Version 1 patch 12 versus version 1 patch 8. Just replace the dot with patch. 
---
Almost all games I know follow that system of updating. 
---
Version upgrades are generally for expansions or game overhaul patches.
---
They can buy it...?
---
You can put boes on the auction house.

My favorite WoW Memory was finally getting my Finkle's Lava Dredger for my shaman almost 15 years ago from Molten Core. I was after it since we first went to MC and it seemed like it took forever, months at least. It was so satisfying to finally get it and walk around with it, definitely one of the coolest looking WoW Classic weapons.
---
At first glace I thought someone organized you all dance lol
---
"wow is at its best when it functions as a friend simulator" as a post genre is more a comment on our sad and lonely society than an endorsement of the game
---
Those groups are the best. Actually let the tank be the one taking damage, keep it to pulls of 3-4. Kill them quickly. Healer never has to drink.
---
After leveling a druid to 32 then switching to a priest and a hunter. I'm really surprised you picked druid haha. I'll agree it's a cool class but leveling with one has been slow. For me anyway.
---
Lol "my casters".
---
just let it sit until they add a tip if they don't ask before trading you, unless they're low level
---
that's interesting, i never knew that!
---
I understand there are good and bad on both, it just feels like I've met so many more assholes on alliance. Maybe it is bias, but I'm not sure. I want to play what I want but I feel so invested into my current character.
---
Everyone's gotta start somewhere. What role are you filling? Tank is the hardest in your state as they are expected to lead, so if you're a Pally/Druid/Warrior you might want to DPS/heal instead. I'm also a tank and actually thought twice recently about switching to DPS instead as I have zero experience in Classic dungeons. However, everyone's gotta start somewhere. And truth be told, so long as you're learning every run and be completely upfront about being new before the dungeon even starts to give your party the chance to bail and that should be totally fine for you as well.
---
I'll agree with this. Favorite is druid for sure. And it's for sure the worst to level for me so far haha.
---
Being on a server that is *slightly* imbalanced might be better for Queue times :)
---
You're a lock, shouldn't be too hard.
---
Let's say raiding with a lvl 60 slavering warg/Deathmaw. Active abilities: Bite 8 (25), Growl (0), Furious Howl 4 (25). Leaves 250 for great stamina, natural armor, and the relevant raid resistance. But how should you divy that up for maximum survivability?
---
Server Queues don't mean anything, they are letting more people in at once now. At least that is what a lot of people are saying.
---
This is true, although I do believe the amount of players allowed on at once is higher now.
---
Downing Yogg for the first time despite our top DPS going mad every single pull, including the kill.
---
Nice, good one dude
---
My first ever heroic raid clear in wotlk is a good memory
---
Raid gear shouldn‚Äôt need to be the best gear. The best gear should be a mix of crafted gear, rare dungeon gear, long epic quest chain rewards and raid gear. Raid sets should have the coolest set effects, but not necessarily the best dps wise.
---
#changemymind
---
Another man person :D
---
This is an underappreciated meme
---
It is true that it is not impressive, but dun need the extra +Def from +armour to survive. So why not.
---
P.s. install a threat meter is a must for tanking raid. Also, I dun know why, stop spamming taunt if another tank is having the aggro on trash as it.
---
Rough. Also, didn't expect the old ass burzum, pleasantly surprised
---
Desperate for views, huh?
---
Is this a serious question?
---
The main thing was I had every profession maxed. I‚Äôd watch the AH for cheap mats the use them to make something. For example: I‚Äôd buy cloth, make some green, then disenchant it.  I think I did the same thing jewel crafting rings and DEing them. I also sold a mechanohog about once every few weeks.
---
The trick is to know that auction house prices fluctuate. Learn the average price for something and buy mats when it‚Äôs cheaper and sell when it‚Äôs higher.
---
Tips is a fraud
---
Multiple layers? Wasn't almost every server down to 1 layer a month ago? All except a few that were 2? Gehennas, Whitemane, Faerlina and maybe a few euro servers that I don't know of?
---
To be honest, those first few days of open beta. It seemed so magical and amazing!!
---
Lmao atleast he tried to be funny about it
---
Grinding rep for Netherwing mount back in WOTLK
---
This is when I don‚Äôt care about your post. Just being honest.
---
Just wanted to say thank you to everyone that responded.  I found a home on the Alliance.  Take care!
---
Can't relate. I've spent the past months being outrolled on all my feral leather by warriors and now that I'm healing raids the sheer number if mages, rogues and warriors in our raid group means that even pieces that are far from optimal will be soaked up as holdover pieces for the actual DPS until they can get their precious BiS items. I probably won't be able to start gethering a decent offspec set before BWL drops.
---
I'm a hunter. I always feel left out when the buffs get passed around, so I just /emote buffs the shit out of everyone!
---
really? my server, Area 52, is pretty empty
---
There was an homage to this in ‚ÄúDude! Where‚Äôs my mount?‚Äù where a rogue swan dives off the dam
---
Actually, probably the first time I saw the priest mindjump spell (can't remember the name). My friend was showing me how he could hop from enemy to enemy, so long as he had vision of them. Blew my mind for some reason
---
I'm aware I need to hold threat for 20 seconds. But I need a few seconds to establish threat in order to do so. If you knew, as you claim, you'd wait a few seconds for the tank to establish threat. More often than not though, you have dps charging in or opening up with a full rotation before I've done anything.
---
works best just to tell th em to fuck off and move on. 
---
"some men you just cant reach"
---
That must make great PvP tho
---
Bro it's an AH item when it drops always ask the party are we needing? Because 98% of the time someone is going to.
---
My favorite WoW memory is when I  discovered Undercity. WoW was my first MMO, and I was not at all familiar with the backstory. Finding a "secret" city below the ruins of Lordaeron was simply magical.
---
the average pop of Nostalrius PvP during peak time was 12000 - 13000, people were complaining all the time that the server had a massive overpopulation problem. i played on Nostalrius' PvE realm back then which instead averaged 3000-4000, hell of a lot more playable for sure.
---
You should be making most moves into macros. It's a 1 to 1 ratio for bar space unless you're making multiple target macros for arenas etc
---
/startattack , /cancelaura, power shifting for extra energy/rage, as /u/Siebolic suggested for heals to break forms are all very handy additions and will take your game play to a higher level.
---
Not only can you possibly reduce buttons on your bars by doing this, you can also reduce the number of key presses you need to achieve certain actions - consider going from form to form, e.g. cat to travel, bear to travel, etc all can be made into the one button.

---
This. I fury tank because it means I can hold aggro and maintain control. I'd much rather play it safe with sword and board but you gotta adapt with the times.
---
This is a good point that I hadn't considered.
---
&gt;weightstones work?
---
They do.
---
Thought locks get their mount via a quest?
---
Another simple concept you don‚Äôt grasp is greed. Needing for gold is greed...
---
Congratulations on getting married, man!
---
That trinket is still fantastic for a pally healer.  Makes your flash of light nearly free and crits will give you some mana.
---
It also depends on your opinion of the warlock mount.  A lot of people just get a regular epic since the lock one is a spell it costs mana and stops your regen which slows down farming.
---
\#showtooltip Garrote
---
/cast Pick Pocket
---
Provided character restoration is working that makes sense.
---
there's definitely a system in place w/ char. restoration that forces you to change your name - iirc. it's been a few years since i came across that.
---
This has been well known since Vanilla with hpals tanking Nef adds. You're all overreacting.
---
Not to mention talking about balance in a 15 year old game that has given us exactly what was promised and what people have been asking for for years. That is what this sub really should be about!!
---
Good luck all!
---
Undead mages are 100% kill on sight because they are almost always cucks
---
"That boy ain't right."
---
You can learn how a class functions without playing it exclusively lol, Source: I know every class inside out.
---
Trinket is as good for mage as it is for you, its on neither of him or yours "bis-list". You did absolutly right to need on it as a healer.
---
I give one warning about stream imitating, then i leave/boot.  Not worth my time/stress to stick around.
---
She didn‚Äôt go boys. Some times she goes. Sometimes she doesnt. That‚Äôs the way she goes.
---
I view them as gritty and fortified, which is cool.
---
Or get a brain and look it up yourself, i dont care if you Believe me or not, this is not politics you slow human being
---
They've never lagged like blizzard servers do in wpvp.
---
"Sir, please get off my farm."
---
Crazy people, for sure. Even the vendors only pay 1.27g~ for it.
---
Aw derp, of course. Make it rain, then!
---
Nah, fuck this guy for not putting that one white bag on the far left.
---
I mean, I was talking to /u/phocasqt because I was replying to him about his friends, but Horde have some of the best landscapes, most interesting races and uniquely designed cities I've ever seen.
---
It‚Äôs a great caster trinket, better for dps but still great for healers. 
---
What you need is [Second Wind](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11819/second-wind)   From the Golem lord in BRD. While Second wind is explicitly + healing power, and Burst of knowledge is + spell power and healing.
---
The secondary effect of reduced spell cost is great for downranking in raids!
---
The trinket does help the mage more than you, but you have every right to roll.
---
I'd almost 100% guarantee they didn't do that so people can't roll for their friends on loot, mages rolling on HOJ for their warrior friend for example
---
To be fair, with 9 tanks you have to come up with some minor distinction to choose the 2 mains.
---
Hmm, TIL. That epic lock mount is the best in the game, though.
---
Regardless, sell it. It won't be used at 60.
---
But it looks so cool
---
Yeah we couldn't have that, but selling raid drops is cool lololol.
---
I‚Äôve been hanging out in Kalimdor doing Tanaris, Azshara and Ungoro and going to Darnassus for city stuff and man sometimes I consider just taking the boat to get back to IF. Place is miserably designed.
---
I need an epic mount, I need some boe blues on AH (or in my locks case stupidly expensive greens), and my guild does need a flask of the titans recipe
---
I don't really see a downside to all needing, I've seen entirely way too many ninjas. I'd love for it not to be that way but shitty people will always exist, especially with the anonymity of being online. And If I win a 50+g item and someone in the group really could use it I just offer to sell it for half price or whatever
---
Or they could pay the party a bit of gold to pass. It can all be worked out ahead of time, as it should
---
I usually assume mages are Meta Slaves, and meta slaves tend to be toxic and elitist
---
Id of rolled need to for my guildie.  If it aint BoP im probably rolling if its worth a decent chunk of gold. We all need gold buddy
---
You're right to have rolled on it. And I really wish people would stop making a big deal out of pre-raid BiS.
---
Hahha yeah it's a mechanic that mobs are queuing up 5 white swings then unloading them all in one GCD when they get to you.  
---
Truly hope you're trolling and not a dullard
---
I would imagine petopia has answers to all of these questions.
---
my hunter is lv. 10 so idk XD
---
And gromsblood. That dropped to a quarter on my server.
---
What‚Äôs the addon that displays the Greater Blessing of Light across the screen?
---
Idk about you guys but my raid has 10 mages. 1 GBoK is basically a taunt lol
---
i know that, but i don't quite understand/know the reasoning behind it.
---
Can you explain/point me to something that does
---
Bigglesworth feels pretty balanced
---
How many level 60s do you have?
---
That's the entire reason to gank in cities lol...
---
I joined late in vanilla and spent most of my time in battle grounds so I wasn't 60 when TBC came out. When I finally got to 70, my best friend and I immediately started arena with our horrible gear ended up at about a 900 rating and had the time of our lives. We would face the worst teams and it was a blast! They either had bad great like us, a really bad team comp or no skill at all but they tried hard and so did we.
---
Ok bye
---
You'll be fine, ideally you want to mix it up a bit since a handful of  endgame quests require you to visit a dungeon anyway.
---
The advantage to staying in dungeons is that you can farm up your BiS gear while gaining levels, it just gets a bit tedious after a while.
---
You miss looting first on garrote needing to loot twice as mentioned but with cheap shot it almost always works. Weird.
---
Plenty of players still leveling.
---
How do you feel if the healer tells you you can probably pull 1-2 more at a time because I‚Äôm barely throwing heals and mostly spend time wanding and waiting. Do you pull more?
---
&gt; EDIT: It works, I just got a namechange!
---
Really? As far as I know, you'd have to wait 30 days after deletion so you can resolve the name conflict with a name change. Otherwise, it'll just say you can't restore it. See [this bluepost:](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/19878357639)
---
&gt; If the character was deleted in the last 30 days, but the name is taken by another character you will not be able to restore that character until the character that now claims the name is deleted, transferred or otherwise frees up the name. The undelete option isn't intended to be able to be used as a name change service so it won't allow for it.
---
I'm just curious if they changed it.
---
Dungeon is way better for leveling u could have started that from level 50 already in BRD, do dungeons and try start getting ur pre raid bis
---
Kromcrush is certainly a good one. It‚Äôs one of the newer realms so I‚Äôm sure it has a friendly community.
---
It's not mage BiS.
---
2x Freezing bands or Briar/Eye of the Beast is.
---
He was spewing shit.
---
Even the name goergegreen was taken on server bigglesworth, at least i got my guild name &lt;sunnyvale crooks&gt;
---
I havnt seen a epic in 1000s of mobs i killed eather, its still a chanse
---
Retailers.
---
Not sure if I‚Äôm right or if it‚Äôs been brought up, but I was in a similar situation and when I tried to xfer my guy from east to west, it said you can‚Äôt move regions. 
---
Anyone else have this issue?
---
I guess you can't pickpocket when you need two hands to hold the garrote ;)
---
You don't go for revenge after getting killed like that?
---
You're not even the one that wanted to play pvp server, your friends are. The person who didn't want to pvp doesn't like pvp. Wow, big surprise.
---
Gnome War, wish I were an Orc but the friends wanted Alliance
---
Wow I'm an idiot lol
---
I'm all for #nochanges, but would support automatically and immediately soulbounding all items that you rolled Need
---
Lol damnit, not sure why i thought he was a hunter
---
2k. U need 6k mana to kill without inner focus.
---
Auctionator if you want a simple but useful AH addon.
---
Undead warriors are pretty needed without fear ward on the horde side tbh. That single fear removal is so nice to have on certain fights and can make or break a fight sometimes.
---
Nah. This is prime example of a retail player not understanding how old threat works. 
---
In retail tanks dont have to put any effort into holding aggro.
---
Looks like frost trap that op laid
---
I only expect you to do it for "free" if you're levelling and opening something lower than 300.
---
Otherwise you're getting a tip, especially if you weren't barking in yell for the service.
---
Doest sell for much. Epic lock mount is still hundreds of gold.
---
i'll trade your anti-fear racial for my +5 intel =\]
---
Or conversely, all the edgelord kids rolling horde because they are so hard and has the perception as the "pvp" faction. This is definitely happening as well. 
---
Many mature players recognized alliance would be the minority faction with more open world pvp to enjoy.
---
Update: Huh thats strange. I decided to close WoW, restart Battle.net, and now loads straight into my character screen........wonder why that happened? Guess issue has been resolved but still kinda curious
---
Dailies stress me out. I don't like feeling pressured to play a game all the time.
---
All too often I get mages tell me "just open trade next time" when I ask nicely for water, I'm so conflicted.
---
This

Spam folder, if empty login to blizzard account settings and see if email has changed
---
Someone tried to log into your account from a different IP (usually). It happened to me back in the day when I played from different locations. Resetting your password usually unlocks it, and is a good idea if someone has access to your account.
---
Check on battle.net to see if your email was changed or anything

What‚Äôs the cage for? o.O
---
\*record scratch\*

\*freeze frame\*

Yup, that's me. You're probably wondering how I ended up in this situation.
---
Coming back for classic feels like a breath of fresh air,  it really still feels as good as it did before but it feels like more of a community now more than ever.
---
TYSM!!
---
I mean it's a couple gold the important thing is people are there bottom line
---
I'll look into this, thanks!
---
18s unless you're somehow still not honoured with any faction.
---
People skipped packs since vanilla....
---
This is why you wait to see what everyone rolled before you do in case there's someone who pulls this.
---
Mind you he rolled a 95.
---
I 'had" 5 when I played vanilla 13 years ago. Do you honestly think mastering a class is like getting a Phd or are you just trolling me?
---
OP‚Äôs topic was talking about leveling experience overall, and dungeons is big part of it. Also Like I said before UC is good capital to set hearth in, when you are in range of upper 50s to 60s, to be running brd over and over and over. If you don‚Äôt like to that‚Äôs on you. 
---
Horde has fp in searing gorge, burning stepps, badlands(which alliance do not). Altho longer flight time from UC than SW or IF, but beats running to zep then to UC fp. 
---
Horde and alliance has fp in EPL. Alliance has 1 in WPL which horde do not but UC is close by.
---
The Armor of the fang at 18 will quickly replaced, so how do you think your argument of extra quest/name mobs that give 10slot bags holds. I mentioned that I got the bags for free because it‚Äôs advantage is so minimal.
---
It's lvl 37, but I think it's either bis 39 twink bow, or close to it. 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=2825/bow-of-searing-arrows
---
I'm a 60 hunter, 300 skin/lw. Really would love jumper cables with feign death, but, can i comfortably drop skinning? Really not sure how important skinning is to LW in classic aside from saving gold. (like especially for boss skins)
---
Thank you.
---
One could argue Acti/Blizz just copied someone else's game too. None of the original designers still work there, several even badmouth the company these days.
---
Hey, I found an answer to the last question somewhere (all abilities count towards max TP), but the other question is one not answered on Petopia. It's also probably a series of questions (i.e. what's best for each use-case) rather than something you can answer generally.
---
I would say you WANT to level via dungeons after 50. You can work on your pre-raid BiS. I feel like you should do better at dungeoning with your spec, you can do decent damage while heal if you are good with using mouseover macros for healing.
---
Vanish with huntersmark OMEGALUL
---
Just ask for gold then, if someone is willing to vendor it for free, power to them.
---
But phase 1 your ass is mine
---
Which would you recommend?
---
Yeah i could have mentioned that. Alliance
---
i mean reality is ill still be here everyday on the game just kinda bored most of the time. maybe by time pvp is out ill also have alannas embrace to go with my headmasters charge.
---
What do I know? All I know is that it does sell for that much.
---
Yeah I did UD warrior because in vanilla I wanted to perverse the same exact thing I was 15 years ago so here I am but dayum those orc racials were make my gear setup's so much easier
---
You lied to the guy in the chair Rick
---
Threat meters get threat based on what is programmed into them. It‚Äôs highly likely that the treat meter creator didn‚Äôt add in gbok
---
Sell, flurry is only good with axe of the deep woods or better. Since you arent min maxing i doubt you want to spend another 300-400g to make flurry good.
---
How did you get 438 SP? As a mage, will all pre-bis and 1 igniting belt, I only manage to get to 309 SP frost.. without flask or any pots

In 2019, where political correctness reigns supreme.... 50% of the dudes played identify as a chick.
---
OmniCC, shows your cooldowns on your spells icons. 
---
RealMobHealth, shows enemies hp in numbers. 
---
EnemyCastBars, shows what your enemy is casting and for how long. Very useful for a rogue as you will have to interrupt spells.
---
Atlasloot, will show you every dungeon/raid/profession item and tells you where you find/how to craft them.
---
&gt; this is not politics
---
WTF does politics have to do with this? You make a claim you need to provide proof. Never seen anyone actually prove you can get anything other than the standard drops from junkboxes. Wowhead and the other databases don't show epics as ever being looted from junkboxes. So yeah you need to provide proof or take you theory elsewhere.
---
squadW

In that case they should have bought it on the Auction House. They clearly felt the upgrade wasnt worth the gold, and by telling everyone else to greed they are just asking for a handout.

No they absolutely weren't Lmao. Alliance was outnumbered on just about every pvp server. And they were CONSIDERABLY outnumbered on  a few

People need to learn about opportunity cost then. The "I farmed it myself, so it's free" mentality is common in MMOs but it's wrong.
---
So the thing with this is you need to be not moving for the macro to work. Pick pocketing won't work if you're moving
---
that lock made me do a spit take.
---
Ah yes because trying to buy items from the winner of a roll never existed before
---
I wish I had a spare 1200g.

Still on my way to affording Hide of the Wild, Truefaith Vestments.
---
There's so many "BIS" items that are stupidly expensive for other classes too.
---
We‚Äôre still layered on incendius.  You‚Äôre seeing half the players in the world.
---
How so? I played a hunter in pvp 13 years ago when this patch dropped and I was pleased with this change. Hunters had an "I win" button against rogues that totally mitigated one of the fundamental abilities of their class. It was not even fair.
---
Definitely, people are taking "BIS" way too seriously, passing on a 1% less effective item so that they can keep trying for the best item they'll never win.
---
I had a priest BOE drop the other day and I thought about rolling on it for my wife but I didnt. Fortunately another warrior needed it in the group....
---
Molson, the first Horde player on this server to attain Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros, [called me](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/do8j8z/its_been_a_dream_for_10_years_what_do_i_do_now/f5lf9fa/) out on /r/classicwow for my "activities" at the Thorium Point fp/graveyard and challenged me to a duel. We fought today at 7PM in the arena and I managed to win three out of three duels. As per his request I am making this thread to let the server know that the duels were honorable ones and that my opponent fulfilled his obligations. Unlike most Horde on this server he was not afraid to fight me alone.
---
I will continue my gorilla activities at Thorium Point until the Horde cease the atrocities they commit on a nightly basis in Blackrock Mountain or until I get bored. I will keep thinning the herd entering the mountain and summarily executing all war criminals as they take rez sickness and spawn at the graveyard. I encourage all interested allied parties to do the same.
---
If anyone else takes issue with my actions feel free to challenge me to a trial by arms and we can settle the matter.

no fire strike to finish mobs, not using ice barrier to prevent pushback when 1 mob resisted nova, using "melee" blizzard
---
lul just respect into frostbite and go questing, aoe farming is not for you
---
Using that you lose out on +53 healing and +10 spirit.  (hammer of grace + thaurissan scepter)
---
But you do gain 20 int + 9 mp5.
---
What item combo can you get +80 healing in weapon?
---
Start your own groups and reserve specific items for yourself. Some people hate reserving but if you‚Äôre the tank, well, they deal with it or don‚Äôt run at all. I don‚Äôt think anyone will be angry if you reserve 1 item a run that‚Äôs not for your tanking spec. At the same time you roll on whatever tanking upgrades
---
I keep seeing bots in this spot and reporting them. Feels good.
---
Yup can confirm have died many times to this bug
---
jesus christ
---
Don't worry, the Ret pally only takes Girdle and TF
---
Unless you're farming devilsaur I get the idea that skinning isn't going to make you much, even at 60.
---
It's not just all RNG though. I don't play a class where my BiS is a BoE. So essentially I have no chance at all to roll need on an expensive BoE and get a free sack of gold handed to me. That's not really fair just because I picked a class that doesn't need expensive BoEs. It's not just "same dif" here.
---
And before "well it's not fair that they have to farm gold for their items," I'd love to be able to just farm for 10 hours and be guaranteed to get my item, instead of where I'm currently at where I farm for 40 hours and still don't have my item.
---
It has to be a copy.  There‚Äôs no other positive way to handle it.
---
Well you can just use master loot for this, has nothing to do with the trade after loot feature.
---
True, not sure why I forgot about that. Whoops.

In a full boosting party (4 lowbies 1 60), the xp/hr is great‚Äîmuch better than solo. This holds true at least through ZF. It‚Äôs also pretty afk depending on the dungeon, since you may clear in less than 12 minutes, creating short breaks for yourself every hour.

That‚Äôs some shady shit.  I have seen the ones where someone doesn‚Äôt have the money to buy something, makes up some story about not being in town, just COD it to me, then it sits in the mailbox for 3 days as a hostage while the player tries to come up with the money.
---
&gt;So why not.
---
Because if mitigation isn't a concern you should be fury tanking.
---
Got it three weeks ago for 120g.  I haven‚Äôt really farmed much since I got it.  Just log in and money.
---
So its about the gold?
---
Can you remind me what the greed icon is, again?
---
You could report him. It would give you your gold back and get him banned. Blizz is pretty good about dealing with scammers if the evidence is there.
---
Same. Also happened a lot with my old isp.
---
My question is why did you trade over mail instead?
---
Thanks for the informal criticism i will take note and evolve my gameplay as an AoE specced mage in the future.
---
Hoping someone figures this out, unfortunately it's a .05% droprate iirc
---
The people who keep posting the same shit, over, and over again.
---
Empty?
---
There were 3 other people in that group so yeah bit of a dick move. Better to kick the Mage and get 1 more dps, or if you arent the leader tell the leader to kick or you will leave. 
---
The Mage was a dick to be sure. But so were you because of your actions.
---
The post is mainly about the minus 50dkp meme, but yeah I am investing on them atm.
---
This. 1000%. The ammount of times in pugs I've told the dps I have a guild full of people who will come in an instant. DPS are replaceable. Very easily too. I threaten them with that then they usually behave. 
---
If they don't and they aren't leader I won't move until they are gone or I am gone. Either way, I won't have any down time. 
---
Man it's satisfying being a tank. Nothing better than letting some shitty dps who can't wait 5 seconds die and laugh at his repair bill.
---
The problem is you have to drink constantly.
---
I found that it is actually faster to just stay in cat even as balance since you never have to stop and drink even if you kill things slower.
---
Lvl 60 and raiding and have been unlucky on a few pre-raid BIS pieces. You‚Äôd better believe I am wearing an AH green in a slot or two as a placeholder while continuing to farm - when the AH piece is a few points better than what I was wearing, I‚Äôm willing to spend a little money to keep up my raiding output. I won‚Äôt wear it forever (hopefully!!) but good to have as a tweener piece in a pinch.
---
Blade flurry only hits targets in the radius of your character, not the target you are attacking. May be your positioning yourself incorrectly
---
Really? I hit level 30 myself yesterday and was getting absolutely hammered in Stranglethorn. Went to Hillsbrad and Arathi to get a couple of levels first lol (playing a gnome mage)
---
As much as that's annoying: at least you'll either get your money or your item back.
---
My favorite memory, was when I got the volcanic stone Drake. That achievement took me a while during Cata AND having a unique mount felt so rewarding!
---
Agreed, it‚Äôs always a Winnipeg when you make some phat gold.
---
So you're a bit of a shithead, huh?
---
This is hard to answer and depends on whom you ask. 
---
Vanilla doesn‚Äôt hold your hand. It can be agonizing sometimes but the rewards you get actually make everything worth it. Drop rates on quests are sometimes just ridiculous. You‚Äôll die if accidentally take on 1 more mob than you meant. 
---
Half of the fun of doing a dungeon is successfully getting a group together. And those dungeon quests that appear at the beginning of a dungeon in Retail? They‚Äôre spread out all over the world and sometimes have chains. For instance, you have to go to TB, UC, AND Org to find the RFC quests. And in dungeons, you can‚Äôt just blast through it. DPS taking aggro can result in whipe or at least their death. Mobs hit harder and die more slowly, in and outside of dungeons. 
---
Leveling is slow. It can take 2x-3x the amount of time to get to 60 as it does to go 1-120. You don‚Äôt get a mount until 40, and it can be hard to save up for. Holy hell though, does it feel good to finally be on a mount. 
---
This game puts WORLD in world of warcraft. There‚Äôs so much and it feels so expansive it‚Äôs just amazing. The people you grouped up with for BFD? You‚Äôll see them again when you go to do BRD. Its worth it to make friends in this game and it makes the community feel a lot better. 
---
Oh and talents? You can‚Äôt just change them around in a city for free. Respeccing is pricey, and you get a point for every level, not a choice between 3 options every 15. You have to actively research what the best leveling spec is depending on if your grinding dungeons, grouping with friends for questing, or going solo. 
---
THIS is the game I fell in love with and it‚Äôs so rewarding, but it‚Äôs not the fast paced/ easy-to-level game that retail is today. Like I said, it can be brutal at times but I hope you enjoy it.
---

Your best bet is thousand needles/hillsbrad+ SMGY/RFK/Gnomer to get to around 33/34 before heading to STV.

Does anyone know which mod it might be?  The major ones i have are:

DBM

I can't seem to find anything in any of the settings and its driving me NUTS, was hoping someone else had the same problem and knew where to find the setting.

My favorite wow memory is the world pvp event one of the guilds on the server put on the kill one of its members in blackrock mountain
---
You needed that item, so you roll need. Not wrong at all.
---
Leave priority looting to organized guild runs.
---
Wayne, how are ya now?
---
Babe, I'll take all the fish scales you got. Everyone in Orgrimmar shall breathe water.
---
Likely to be DBM?
---
It‚Äôs not even Mage BiS lol
---
It‚Äôs Z Perl. Not on WoW atm but from memory, on the options page select the 2nd rightmost tab (or somewhere around there) then deselect aggro warning
---
Dont listen to any of these people saying the weapon is bad. You dont use it for dps. You use it to spam hamstring in raids to buff your OTHER melee. The haste buff and stat buff are amazing if you're willing to sacrifice your own dps to benefit your raid group. Think of it as nightfall for melee.
---
This is not true. Even if he did, he‚Äôd have it equipped over his current offhand.

Currently, the availability of plate gears is not good enough for fury/prot tank to generate more threats than shield slam prot built on single target. Fury/prot depend on crit/flurry proc.
---
I need it if someone is gonna equip it I trade it to them.
---
report them
---
2 months is practically nothing on Blizzard games standard. Even Diablo 3 had players buying an axe for $12k 5 months after that shit game release
---
My tip, none of the advice you get will help.  You've played every class.  Do your own thinking, we can't read your mind or know what you like so our opinions will always be biased to our own preference.
---
There is cheetah form which is just for travel which is 40% speed and cat + dash is the same as 60% mount.
---
Solo tanking UBRS and having a hunter kite took my 50+ runs to get that shield. My first 2 MC runs were done with out it. I got it right before my 3rd MC and Garr dropped his lol. 
---
Truthfully a guild only needs 2 MT the other warriors should be fury who can slap on a shield if needed for a few fights. If you want to tank I‚Äôd start looking for a new guild that is still making their roster.
---
Burst of Knowledge is option 3 for mages and good to have in case Reed farming takes a while
---
Mount speed is double cat form, pretty sure it's 30 percent
---
Why is that? I played a lot of Druid in BC and WOTLK but decided against it for classic release (didn‚Äôt want to play a tauren and I wanted to be horde).
---
Get his character name, server, and faction and order him some in game gold online
---
(Do not do this, lol)
---
Hell no you weren't wrong. You aren't their servant. If he doesn't want to do the dungeon at your pace he can find another tank and take even longer to do his dungeon.
---
That utility is summons and hearthstones. Get used to it.

That is an old school scam. People did that in Diablo 2.

I think i saw you before, are you on faerlina?

Dwarf?  Always.  Other races?  Yes.

Healthstones... hearthstone is what you use to get back to ironforge so you can make it to raid on time, peasant.
---
Yes,  it's always a pain to find healers
---
Well, there isnt a loot priority over epic boe prebis, so why would be one on the books. In the endgame pugs are just shitty. Its weird bc before i reached 60 i was kinda fine with them, but bc people run so much dungeons for their prebis gear they are tired of it, they doesnt pay attention,want to make it faster,frustrated about the whole thing and its just not fun to play with ppl like that,especially when the healer pulls 2 packs and we die.
---
Its not a theory, its just that i know more than you in this topic and you are Mad about it for some wierd reson. Like anyone wants to provide you any proof at all lol. You just luckey to know this is possible now
---
Catrick Swayze is the one I stole.
---
100% accurate
---
Not yet, once pvp gear comes out cheetah forms gets pretty close to normal mount speed.
---
yet the best private server ever made. your ignorance is pretty disgusting!
---
I take it intercept is too risky?
---
Which valuable things are you farming? Or what should I be looking to grind on my way through late 40s and 50s to help save for mount?

I remember 15 years ago watching a warrior PvP video. The warrior in the video didn't have great gear, but I remember watching him charge people and hitting really hard before popping execute. At that moment, my mage was immediately shelved and I rolled a warrior and loved every second of it.

Hey everyone coming back to classic wow and decided i want to heal.. problem is not sure what class i want to go, i plan on going hard for raiding and battlegrounds once their out and would like to hold my own in wpvp.. know it's a lot to ask for a healer but forgot how classic worked. Any suggestions?
---
I'm pretty much in the same boat. I got to 60 (super fun), but now i cbf finding/making groups for my pre-raid bis. I got an alt to 32 but losing motivation because lvling a 2nd time is pretty boring and I know at 60 i probably wouldn't even try and gear it.
---
Hardcore gamers play with their font as Wingdings, you fucking casual
---
inspired by Moon Guard I see
---
Subtract that total from your repair bill for getting the soulstones. You come out negative.
---
Yeah of course not, I let others tank those. 
---
Nobody called it a taunt, they said it effectively acts as one.
---
If its a nuke, on a threat wipe, you can just nuke it back up to top. You sound salty that Paladins are now best tanks all around. AoE and single target.
---
Thats why you cast intimidation and find stealth.
---
This is actually really good
---
Part of it may be hubris. Paladins are told they can't tank all the time, so it's fair that the ones who would challenge that are the ones who push it as far as they can.
---
But paladin tanks are definitely better in dungeons than raids for a few reasons. They do drop off in raids, but I don't think they'd have as many issues as people think.
---
People are basing their info off private servers... Who knows just how much those servers got wrong unless we try things out all over again?
---
Dungeons will always be relevant, maybe not on your main character, but your alts or others. New players will come and not have guilds to give them a free ticket into mc, bwl, or whatever raid.  
---
Your personal mileage may vary.
---
Cant agree more on the cities. To me each Alliance city feels better than any  of the Horde cities.
---
The internet doesn‚Äôt give you carte blanche to be an asshole, if anything it just brings out your true colors you absolute troglodyte.
---
if you are levelling, skin+gathering 
---
at 60, pick up eng (if you want to pvp) and if you like the other prof. keep it for farming. You should probably choose mining if you go this route - it allows you to not rely on the AH and you can profit off of it too.
---
39 (40 rather) is bis, but the hat isn‚Äôt bad.
---
I had a friend that started leveling an alt with enchanting. He tried to use "I'm leveling enchanting" as an excuse to roll on way too much stuff. That got sorted out pretty quickly though.
---
I hope you stop bullshitting you way through life then run scared when called out :)
---
They‚Äôre really not too bad.  BS does help supplement a few things but it‚Äôs not too incredibly necessary. Depending on your server, mining may prove lucrative so you can sell to get money instead of making things for now. 
---
Nothing wrong with making your own stuff though, enjoy it however you go about it.
---
Let me ask you something, and you can answer (honestly) to the best of your ability. When you are in a raid, what classes do you see less of, and which ones do you see more of? When out questing, what classes do you see less of and what classes do you see more of? When diddling at IF bank, what classes do you see more of, and what classes do you see less of? You don't need someone else's data to validate this. The only classes I could see being fewer than warlocks would be druids and hunters, and that wouldn't be by a very large margin if at all. That leaves priests, warriors, mages, and rogues which far exceed warlocks, druids, hunters, shamans and paladins by a significant margin. Log in to any server, go to a city and make your own judgment. I'm not gonna fish for data that you can easily find yourself.
---
Nobody is questing solo as holy priest. Any good Paladin will LoS your mana burn.
---
ST Healing is exactly what makes them better than a raid healer. The raid can heal themselves, they shouldn't be getting damaged enough to die. They can get out and FA, or have a priest aoe heal and go OOM and cry for innervate.
---
I could out heal you easily, by the time you go oom I wont even be at 50% mana
---
I think what you're looking for is a PvE realm
---
So is demanding you get a xxx gold item just because its your class, which all you people on that side simply cant grasp, YOU are the selfish entitled brats, not us.
---
Charge in, hit mob, mob gets tagged by another dude. Wut.
---
Krom is still pretty heavily horde favored but not nearly as bad as some other servera.
---
I've been scammed like this with the Tal'Rasha's chest, that's why i was carefull with this one.
---
You have the best guild, right there. You best treasure them right back.
---
Even if you subscribe to the idea that Need/Greed goes out the window when an item is worth a lot of money, it's still a ninja situation because he waited until everyone else picked Greed, THEN rolled Need and got the item with no contest.  "All Need" is no longer an option when everyone else in the group has already rolled Greed.
---
Same exact thing happened to me on Kromcrush. Undie is a ninja:

Does she know you're into t-girls? Lol
---
I have two, one for each of ya.
---
Realistically?  Absolutely NOTHING.  Retail went to shit years ago and JAB listens to shareholder directives over the voices of the player base.  There is literally less than a 0% chance of players like me going back to retail.
---
Take it further. Don't bring dps only bring healers and tanks. Make the fight last forever and you get more to dispell.
---
I mean, if we are talking through the lifespan of my lock and getting shards since I began this toon, yeah you'd be right then.. I would come out negative by an extremely large amount
---
Why is the game addressing you as Ihr and Eure which is plural? Shouldn't it say "Das k√∂nnen Sie etc.."?
---
Yes but by only a little. The full damage bonus only applies to single target spells like shadow bolt.
---
I never demanded such nor do I.
---
For every month you do not respec theborice is reduce back one increment, usually 5g.
---
How was SM?
---
I only played vanilla, never pservers. From what I remember and have seen so far in classic, this is what I predict:
---
Vael for awhile. Because it requires you to have farmed decent gear.
---
Then Nef, because you need an onyxia scale cloak or you die. I expect that once P2 is near/happens guilds/pugs will do onyxia in as small of groups as possible for maximum onyxia scales.
---
RNGeezus can make Chromaggus a pretty good gear check depending on what elements were rolled that week.
---
Few pugs will kill C'Thun by the time Naxx releases.
---
For Naxx, pugs will certainly kill some bosses. I doubt a pug will clear Naxx in the first few months it is out.
---
Was about to make a reply about how mages aren‚Äôt as bad as huntards, then i watched the video.....
---
As a Horde player on Stalagg, I gotta say, y'all give as good as you get. Tonight the Kargath flightmaster was dead when i got there. When I get to BRD, an Alliance group was camped at the bottom of the chain picking off any Horde trying to get down to the Hall. They got wiped out pretty quick, but it was fun and I grudgingly admire that Stalagg Alliance WTF attitude.
---
Is there a book that drops for the warrior class, if so what's called?
---
Thanks :)  and I‚Äôm level 60 :-)
---
Fucking /r/titlegore, man. AND spam. Lovely combo.
---
It might surprise you but, some people can‚Äôt just ‚Äòfarm it‚Äô  not everyone can sit down and devote 10 hours to wow every night.
---
I actually had this drop in original vanilla as a Ret pally. Lost it to a hunter. I was mad to say the least.
---
Also, chances are if you're going oom, you have a group that is being sloppy with regards to taking damage. Back in the day, we used to cc every pull, and wait for tanks to get aggro, and healers were much happier. Honestly, chances are as a healer, you're already carrying other people's mistakes, and won't really realize it until you think about it.  You good man, just make sure you bring water everywhere lol.
---
Do you know what gold stacks get you?
---
Swords, helms, gear with unique stats and abilities that can help power my or some other character up.
---
No.  Stop.
---
So you agree that everyone in the group should have an equal shot at it then.
---
I might be wrong, but I think there might be an unstuck button in the character management section on the website as well.
---
People are saps.
---
They're going to fix terrible videos with vague titles and annoying laughter? 
---
What's the problem? Too many people? Big PvP battles? Seriously what exactly are you complaining about?
---
Classic wow is really a walled garden for me now, I love the community.
---
Thanks man I need to look into all the gear I can get. Cheers
---
Lol you‚Äôre saying to make a brand new game. That wouldn‚Äôt be WoW. That would be a WoW 2 or something.
---
Or Balance, by hatchet, axe, and saw!
---
Now we're thinking with parses
---
Is it the lag or what that is bothering you?
---
I, too, find it much easier to sleep after justifying any action as 'common sense'.
---
what spec are you running when you farm this?
---
Or change servers.
---
Yea I was just trying to see if there was something more helpful than this video lol. 
---
Obviously characters arent supposed to run in place forever while no effects happen etc.
---
Same on Fairbanks as alliance it's problematic
---
You can read it, you can't see it *fine*.
---
/facepalm...........
---
One month after hitting 60 in vanilla wow, and waiting outside of molten core waiting for a raid spot to hopefully open up. Then after two weeks of waiting I got a spot and raided with them for a year and a half.
---
A time machine.
---
When wow launched with so few servers, it was clear blizzard was not interested in providing an excellent consumer experience. It really does feel like they are obstructing wow classics experience imo. Perhaps sheer incompetence, perhaps it's ignorance, but it sure feels like they don't want it to work.
---
Dont worry man you will be fine
---
You're sad
---
She made a mistake. You can‚Äôt even screen capture
---
Probably because it was a legitimate question that other people wanted to know the answer to as well, so they upvoted it for visibility.
---
Short term gains, for long term pains.
---
Favorite memories as playing as 29 twink rogue and bsing with guildies in WOTLK
---
Human male as a caster class and looking cool don't really go well together.
---
Yeah it has a pretty good pop on the ally side. Horde seems to have the same. My guild raided Tarren Mill last night and it ended up in a 20 ally vs 30 horde world pvp battle so there is definitely still some pvp that goes on if you want to be apart of that
---
It's up to them. I opened boxes while leveling up and it was always waste of time. Every 10 person tipped or maybe not even that. People got 20g worth of items, epics even like Vanguard gloves and some of them didn't even tip one copper. From what I have opened and seen, usually people get avg 3-5 g worth items from 225 lvl lockboxes so demanding 1 g is more than fair. If people do it for free, it's their choice. When it comes to earning money, lockpicking is not profitable even if you do it for 1 g per box. Most I earned was maybe 25-30 g  in hour. I can get 40-60 with 65  g being my highest gold per hour in BRD, pickpocketing and killing some bosses. I made friends along the way while leveling/pugging/PvPing so I don't really need to do charity for that. And for socializing I prefer to talk and RP than being useful lockpicking tool.
---
Thanks.
---
It's never too late.. there is still a long way to go before we run out of content. Play at your own speed and enjoy it, there is no rush to get to 60.. everything will still be there when you make it
---
The only thing I regret is not rolling on a PVE server. I did not realize the small amount of time I would actually have to dedicate to Classic. I‚Äôm a little upset to be so invested in a PVP server where asshat teenagers will yank me when all I want to do I know out a few quests.
---
Omen isn‚Äôt updated/available. Tiny Threat Plugin  that comes default with Details is the only reliable solution I‚Äôve found.
---
I got a 99 parse on Golemagg with it today so I'd say it's at least decent.
---
Why would it be any different then now? People landing from flights are honorless, just like now.
---
I grabbed Randers, Lahey, and Bobandee on my server
---
I've had a couple of those via SMS from Blizzard themselves (proved via password reset codes sent from the same number) but my account had nothing wrong with it, no dodgy activity at all. 
---
I just logged on and continued to play. The 'locked out' bit never actually 'locked me out of anything'. I just assumed a dodgy Blizz automated system made a mistake
---
Fishing was the first skill I got to 300 well before hitting 60.
---
As opposed to **screen**shots of other things?
---
ElvUI and Details consolidates all of these (except for Questie)
---
Eh. Alliance feels ‚Äúclean‚Äù to me and Horde feels ‚Äúdirty‚Äù.  
---
Context: rolled Horde from vanilla through MoP when I quit.
---
When trying to attract viewers to your stream try to include as little information as possible and also make sure to have at least 3 typos and horrific grammar in the title. This will ensure the highest chances of success.
---
Yeah but the item that he was going to buy on AH dropped for him instead.
---
He was lucky enough to have it drop, he should get it.  The others weren't as lucky, life goes on.
---
Anyway i guess we just disagree on that premise.
---
Considering there would only be 1 other Druid max rolling on it, after they get a piece it‚Äôd go to you just from default.
---
Yea, but any solo content will give less rewards than group content.  I've had a great time learning how to solo mara for my Blackstone ring, but if I ran strath or ubrs in the same amount of time I woul probably be in a better spot overall.
---
Not that there isnt fun solo content to do, but it's nearly as useful since you dont need any xp, and the other rewards from solo content usually arnet that great
---
As your healer, if i cant bitch about lifetap then you cant bitch about summons. "Do your job"
---
All of the Classic Atlas plug-ins are super high value: maps, dungeon entrances, vendors, etc
---
Blizzard has billions of dollars lol. The fact we are comparing them to private servers speaks volumes. Blizzard isn't commiting the proper resources to a game proven to operate well with no money. BILLIONS! Lol
---
My server doesn‚Äôt have anywhere this amount of people that I have seen. Kinda sad.
---
I mean if MMOs were made for only Week 1 players they wouldn't have much of a lifespan. While youll be "behind" youll eventually catch up regardless because we wont be getting New content faster then you can level and gear a few characters
---
Well, imagine for a progression raid, everyone had double the health/ mana they likely do with current raid gear, but in return they have less dps.   
---
What you‚Äôd likely find is that it takes fewer attempts to kill the boss, since it‚Äôs harder to kill everyone. (Dps meters would suck, but raid members would stay alive)  
---
Pvp is somewhat like a progression raid in that a lot of ppl will be taking damage. But the team with better health/ mana will usually beat the other one.
---
I run paladin tank, 3 mages, and a resto druid. Just started about a week ago, and just hit 50 today. Consecrate / arcane explosion is totally busted. As Alliance struggled up to about level 14 doing what I could for deadmines prequests, then I just lives in dungeons. Deadmines -&gt; Stockades / SFK -&gt; RFK -&gt; SM / RFD (RFD right path is insane) -&gt; ZF. 
---
Plan on running paladin and druid w hybrid specs so they can both tank / heal. There are some places where taunt for aggro drops is clutch, and Stratholme with a paladin tank is a gdamn joke for AoE threat. Mages are specced for imp arcane explosion / shatter Cone of Cold.
---
Yes.
---
It is BIS. Only better options are Briarwood and Eye of the Beast.
---
Bro, I'm level 38 on my main so I don't think you're getting left behind at all. I'm a parent with a full-time job and get in 2-3 hours play 2 or 3 times a week during the evenings with maybe a longer play session over the weekend. Plenty of other people in my guild in the same situation. 
---
Admittedly I started a week or two street Classic launched rather than on Day 1, but still would not be level 45 even if I had started on Day 1. Enjoy the ride,  there will still be plenty of people just getting to endgame when you are
---
God damn this made me hard giggle
---
Sounds like more targets to a rogue.... ;)
---
Vault runs/ coffee runs sometimes come up. Nowhere near as popular as emp runs or arena runs.
---
No life.
---
It has to be a bug. When fiery weapon crits, it most definitely procs vengeance.
---
Yeah im sure you're a paragon of technical literacy.
---
One possible explanation is the game tries to prevent you from dying in one spot and then ghost running to another and spirit ressing there.

&gt; Regardless of what you, or others, want to believe hit is an absolutely under rated stat for warlocks, and it's still rated pretty high. Yes gearing for more crit gives you the potential to do more damage, without a doubt, but the static/average damage from hit in my experience far outweighs the high roll potential.
---
The problem is that there's all of two pieces of warlock hit gear in P1. When you need 15% hit, who cares about the 2% you can get with current gear? And the DPS doesn't matter anyway because MC is trivial. Bosses die in a minute.
---
Cast regrowth and rejuv on yourself before pulling a pack, the healing threat you gain from it is AMAZING.
---
Why, though? It's a BoE, which means it's equal to gold, which means we all need it.
---
Just go buy it off the AH if you need it so badly.
---
Nah that‚Äôs a pre raid bis trinket for holy pally. If your ret then you ninjad it though
---
Because Druid HoT‚Äôs don‚Äôt stack so having more than 1 resto Druid is ineffective and most druids won‚Äôt be taken as Boomkin/Feral cat
---
2 elitist 4 me
---
people are buying them, but when i put them on AH it was the last thing i did before i logged off so they likely just got buried by other posters.
---
Oh I always mention the tip, but how much they get is based on how much water and food they trade me, up to 1g for 6 stacks.
---
u only really got msgd for water like that if your outside certain dungeons or 60 (once your 60, its basically anywhere and everywhere because they know you can create any tier of water).
---
i get ppl of all levels msging me for water, food and portals.
---
Is there an add on that shows what guild they‚Äôre in if I hover over their body but not click them?
---
Im inclined to believe they dont have an actual 1.12 reference client alot of things that worked in 1.12 dont in classic like discombobulator ray.
---
Also https://wow.gamepedia.com/Thrash_(proc) doesnt say anything about mobs but does mention bosses.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=3391/thrash
---
Where as this mentions mobs. But most arent even high level and only has 2 bosses out of the 40 mobs that can use it.
---
So im betting it is actually a bug.
---
Two Hunter kite two elite as far as they can through the instance to buy time for the raid to down some adds and free up tanks and healers
---
You rolled priest and you picked dwarf. You're gucci.
---
I agree 100%. This is a fine example of one of the OBVIOUS changes that needed to be made to classic.
---
The people who expect to have exclusive rights on expensive random BoE drops are the ones with the "me me me" attitude.
---
It probably increases the damage my warrior does by 20-30% with a 2 hander it is not over rated.
---

---
Tbh, a good idea is to just make a lvl 1 alt, run it to the main city and sell things from there. No one expects a discount on items from a lvl 1 alt because you have no guild and your name is different from your main.  
---
Giving a discount to guildies is weird, we all need gold.
---
Getting my warlock epic mount at lv. 70 in BC. 
---
I hit lv. 60 a month shy of BC's release so it was not possible to do it in time (as i was very much a wow noob).
---
It looks awesome!
---
I 2m with a warrior and me on a resto druid. It can feel rough at times but we generally can do it without deaths.
---
remind me 365 days
---
I‚Äôm holy. I tried ret but I could never get into groups and it got boring. I wish Ret was more fun
---
Even then, only tanks really need to worry about fire resist gear.
---
imagine parsing in classic
---
I actually really enjoy ZF when I manage to get a group. But I'm thinking I am too low for mara?
---
You forgot the ! 
---
Just funny how people said it will die in a month. Then it became ‚Äúfew months,‚Äù and now we got an entire year!
---
Yes, I just helped two hunters with it last night. You can even reapply it during the fight
---
That shit is getting old real fast
---
Blame all the people that took some population addon as gospel and transferred to a dead server and blame blizzard for letting it happen. You guys consistently take over kargath and BRD and if those cowards didn‚Äôt leave the server would be far more even.
---
It's nice you not on an actual dead server tho.
---
glad you're enjoying it, but I got bored and quit already.
---
It‚Äôs hard to say, when you mention pvp. But in dungeons, mana generally shouldn‚Äôt be an issue if the tank + healer are doing an adequate job. (Assuming you life tap every now and again)
---
As a warlock, I am usually running around grabbing world buffs in the last hour or thirty minutes before a raid starts. I try to arrive to the instance 5 - 10 minutes before we start and I am more than happy to summon any stragglers, especially people who want to preserve their world buffs. But my guild doesn't take my summons for granted and most people try to show up on time. Otherwise, I am camping out at the instance to preserve my buff durations. I am on a PvP server so I understand requesting a summon to avoid an untimely gank and losing your world buffs. Unfortunately as a warlock this means that I always have to risk my world buffs on my way to the raid in preparation to summon. It is really appreciated when I have bodyguard escorts!
---
Probably was posted in global chat that he was selling and one of them could be farming on a different continent.
---
It‚Äôs not for everybody and that‚Äôs a good thing.
---
Yea, mine's dead too.
---
horde on faerlina! highly recommend if you intend to play for a long time
---
Lost T2 priest helm from ony to fresh 60s twice...
---
ok
---
you think you want to see this but you don't. this is likely a high or full pop server and they have their own set of insane problems. Medium pops are where its at tbh.
---
Ho lee shit
---
I still see layering going on for [US West,](https://i.imgur.com/ecIix2R.png) [US East](https://i.imgur.com/MCnXbFO.png) and [Oceanic realms](https://i.imgur.com/OSTBC2R.png) at the time of this post.
---
I‚Äôm not horde. What happened here?
---
This post serves no purpose then. My retail server is banging, but my Classic server (Anathema) is dead as hell.
---
I don‚Äôt know what everyone is talking about lol how do they not see the issue
---
so not even pre-raid bis technically?
---
that was before the layers got removed bud.
---
I did the same! Got a priest to 41 and got my mount...never even used the mount before rerolling a warrior, which is now 42 with a mount!
---
I had some time off work and just returned today actually after hitting 42 on my warrior, and to be honest, this is more exciting for me than the level 60 I could have now. 
---
The Classic playerbase is older, which I feel Blizzard is aware of, and releasing the Phases accordingly. 
---
As my play time has been cut down, I'm excited to have 2 characters, Priest and Warrior, to bounce between as I do get bored after 4 days played on a single too.  Oh and never having to walk around Azeroth after my 8 hour shift is pretty neat.
---
Also I enjoy being self-sufficient when I can so have a couple toons is nice for crafting/gathering.
---
Low medium or high doesn't matter. Still no god damn tanks to run anything with
---
The progression needed is just so odd: I'm level 14 and need tin, bit most of it is in level 20ish zones...
---
Got a Mooncloth Bag recipe yesterday, first time ever seeing a recipe from a junkbox.
---
This makes no sense.

Isnt that just hardcore guilds?

Why not senpaladin ;(
---
As a rogue with enough CC to keep a Japanese bullet train on the opposite hemisphere, I keep keep them targeted only to know when I need to know fear.
---
you have an awesome eye for lighting dude, keep it up.
---
Which server you on? Would love to see a short clip because area 52 is dead. 
---
The purpose of this post is to show that the game is still alive despite what people claimed. And there‚Äôs going to be another influx of players Coke phase 2 in a few weeks.
---
No way..you can see debuffs not buffs. You need detect magic to see buffs.
---
Lay off the meth

Once as lvl 39 gnome mage I was ganked by some horde players in STV, I grouped up with random players to avenge, and we killed them. They called more buddies and killed us again, then we called ours... expectedly people start to log in with their mains, and half an hour later STV was filled with 70lvls. It was my first character so I teleported away to stormwind. This war lasted about 3 hours, I don't know who won, but I know who started it.
---
I'll just link what I said the last time this was brought up:

Rank 1 Earth Shock is pocket sand too with the spell interrupt
---
If i only ever read about tanking i'd only be using best in slot and no alternatives because this is the non-plus-ultra set and nothing else works without using my brain to mix and match or switch out gear depending on bosses.. Or everyone needs to let me pull aggro over 20 seconds by applying sunder to every mob.. fuck that... tanking is a joke and always has been, its the easiest job in the entire game after dps. heal&gt;dps&gt;tank... we literally only need to take aggro once on bosses and spam our abilities.. i only use shield block on Ragnaros by now, or well.. a shield in general.
---
So what exactly is written there that sounds like i have no clue?
---
I said mages have target-uncapped aoe.. They do.  
---
I said its overall more mana efficient to pull more... It is.  
---
The tank doesn't have to lead the group.. is true aswell since the healer can easily just pull more mobs into the fight with wands if he so decides that we can go faster.  
---
Whats so hard for you to understand that you can improve yourself by just going along with it? If they want you to go faster and pull more you learn over time how to control the chaos you are talking about. Its no big deal really.
---
Optometrist Prime ?
---
When I first started, a gnome rogue gifted me a sick ass blue staff for my priest. Ended up being a friendshio that lasted for years.
---
Warr dps is sick tho, it's highly valued, and plus having backup tanks is never really a bad thing imo
---
As a night elf hunter, I always go to dun morogh to tame a snow leopard, lol.
---
this is hilarious. He acts like its a career, its kind of sad. FUCKING WEEKEND WARRIORS
---
You don't need a shield anyway once you're getting a couple of t1 items plus t2 helmet. You're better off somewhere else.
---
I know the hashtag nochanges crew hates this shit, but I'd love some QoL changes to come in. Barbershop, instant mail between toons, guild banks, etc.
---
what i would do is to ask the group leader to kick him - after warning him/her
---
it's easy to replace a dps and if you have already downed a boss, it's more difficult to replace a tank.
---
that said, if you felt like going back to the group would be detrimental to your mood. you're fine. but try to explain why.
---
&gt; Retail wow servers are pretty well full, what so different?
---
That‚Äôs your initial comment talking about retail servers when this post has nothing to do with retail servers. But MY ‚Äúanecdotal evidence‚Äù lol üòÇ
---
Is Vender Price worth getting on top of an auction mod which basically also shows the vendor price?
---
got to 60 and then realized there is no pvp yet. done for now.
---
I see bubbles reference, I upvote.
---
We have 2 Hunters pull 2 Melee. We kill 1 Melee while the casters are all sheeped and the other melee is on an off tank, and main tank is tanking on the far side of the pit with a dedicated healer. then kill 4 casters. Once that is done the hunters either died, fucked up aggro, or feigned death. kill each melee and done.... easy fight.
---
Ok then instead of being cryptic please explain to me in your vast wisdom why people transferred from Stallag since you think it didn‚Äôt have to do with the population addon or blizzard (lol) even though that is exactly what happened.
---
I think something is off with those bags. Bunch of strat/ scholo runs and I haven‚Äôt seen any. But I was killing the elites outside the dire maul instances (not undead or demon) and got 2 within 10 minutes.
---
You forgot option 3: A reasonable, sober, intelligent person couldn‚Äôt understand what the shitpost is about.
---
Been using sprint for a long time and never seen this, perhaps your graphical settings have something to do with it, or just the area of map and the ground isn't textured properly so the skill overlaps it when the ground is supposed to hide it? Idk
---
There are 4 things to skin at 60 that matter right now: Devilsaur Leather, Pristine Hide of the Beast, Core Hound Leather, Onyxia Scales.  If you aren't your raid/guild designated skinner for Core Hounds and Onyxia then you don't really need it other than for saving money.
---
It's not a mistake. When you put an item in the letter it changes the letter's subject to the item's name. If he did it by mistake the subject would've been "Small Lustrous Pearl (4)" not "Righteous Orb (4)".
---
Just asked him.  Said all his guildies chipped in
---
Is this a troll post?
---
This is exactly the post is in controversial
---
&gt;I think the ideal solution if that if someone pulls themselves then let them deal with it.
---
Then you are not doing our job we are asked to do.
---
&gt; But to say that you don‚Äôt understand why this tank found this frustrating is quite odd to me. It is frustrating
---
How is it frustrating that other people let us know that its ok for them that we can go faster? Just do it then.
---
Yea we have maybe 2 girls I'm our 150 person guild.
---
I actually just tuned into the stream.... Yeah I get it now
---
thats only like 300 people. tops. gaem is fukkin ded m8.

"it is bis except for the actual bis" what dude
---
I rolled a mage, hit 40, rerolled to a druid, hit 41 then rerolled to a warlock and now 50.. same boat.. wasnt having as much fun as I wanted. Even though I had a Druid 60 back then, my main 60 was warlock. + they are currently busted for pvp and always strong for solo pve
---
Fury/Prot tanks only use a shield in a few fights and when something goes wrong. Like pulling an extra add packs you put on a shield and aoe taunt etc. As an offtank I almost never use a shield in MC
---
I really hope Blizzard merges some of the newer servers.
---
This is the kinda shit i buy and stick on a bank alt. "Ill always have gold"

Using force reactive disk to melt rogues in pvp

Shhhh giving away the class secrets!

See that's a very informative side of it, I wasn't truly aware of self promotion and how it is viewed in the reddit community, I'll make Sure to note this and use a more favored way, thank you

Let warrior tank P1 and stay at around 6 in the threat. You'll have her aggro the moment she's back on the ground. Or vice versa.

Not even your class quest?

Walks like a duck, talks like a duck, it‚Äôs a tweaker.

Theres people in this thread saying you cant even find a healer if it isnt prime time. I mean, i'm glad you enjoy it, I hope you still enjoy it in 2 more months when it takes you 3 days to successfully put together a BRD pug. I dont have time for that. I dont want to work all day, log into the game and then fail for 3 hours to find a group to run a dungeon, or never get into a raid because I'm not in the raid group of one of the handful of guilds actually doing the content. 
---
I'm glad it FEELS good to you. Sincerely. But even looking forward like another 2 or 3 months, a server thats "medium" population today is going to be absolutely deserted. Its only been two months, and already servers that were 24/7 queues, or 24/7 "full" are down to medium/low population over the course of the day. 
---
Realistically, if youre coming from a realm with transfers available, a "medium" server is not going to feel good, unless your reason for wanting to transfer is that theres just too many people. Just create a character on any server still listed as layered and run to a capital city. You will be absolutely shocked at how active they are. Scan the auction house while youre there (it doesnt take an hour, it takes 15 seconds) and tell me how great your economy is doing.
---
Ashenvale for ghost saber!
---
Why would I bother having a conversation with someone projecting their anger about something unrelated to me, at me?
---
Have a good night! üòÇ
---
Honestly, I feel like depending on how much you enjoy min-maxing, two sets is generous. So many resistance sets, for both dps and tank, etc. I'm pretty stingy with my respeccs, how much does it hurt? Also I think the price goes down a set ever month or so right?
---
If you plan on doing content as it releases sure you are behind, but that isn't a big deal. People will still be running everything when you reach 60 and in original vanilla people still started playing way later than you will be catch up and managed to work their way up. You'll get loot easier while guilds farm MC/Ony and already have most of the pieces.
---
Undead.
---
Warlock. Edges ahead of mages (imo) if you go both mining and herb because you can solo dm:e jump runs. (There‚Äôs a youtube of this)
---
I'm 55 right now, and I can say without hesitation I would be 58-60 by now if I wasn't constantly being ganked by whored. It has been about an 80/20 split. 80% negative 20% positive experience with world pvp. Definitely have had some good times, but being stomped by skulls or superior numbers for no better reason than fuck you, every day? 
---
I'd either have to shift my mindset to KOS everything, which has repercussions as the whored start pouring out of the woodwork like a clown car. Or only playing when my friends are on for protection. Neither option works for me. So, back to PvE for me.
---
I mean, at level 10 as the first pet.
---
there is plety of content drought to make sure you will get plenty of raids in before BWL
---
You've been taught well young one.

And yes I accidentally left that shit on lmao

Very nice

My irl cats name is Shitty Bill
---
horde has 2 or 3 atm
---
Nearly all classes have this at times I wouldn't worry.
---
No quests will disqualify druid, warrior, shaman, hunter, and possibly paladin, priest, and warlock solely because you can't get all your abilities without quests
---
Provide proof or give it up dude. There is a 0% chance you can find proof as proof does not exist.
---
Because this is stupid. Rolling need in something you personally can‚Äôt/ won‚Äôt use is not okay.
---
Ty for clarifying wasnt sure.
---
GBoK on one class at least twice and you‚Äôll generate like 2k threat....
---
Get edgies. You cannot badrace with 300 skill
---
oh very good argument. I'm not even angry its just hilarious to me that someone could possibly try to refute what I said here. Obviously people spamming trade about how they need to all transfer and citing a faulty statistic (imo) as reasoning made people transfer. I have an alliance toon that sits in trade chat all day and I saw it. 
---
Then the other point is that blizzard obviously enabled it by allowing transfers. I really would love to see how you think what I said here isn't true. 
---
But I guess since you want to be a child about it, disagree, then walk off and not explain why then go right ahead kid.
---
I‚Äôd like to add a further questions for any number crunchers/theory crafters. 
---
1. How does Quel‚ÄôSerrar compare to claw?
---
2. If an Orc maintank has QS or Paw, is Deathbringer an upgrade?
---
How exactly do you use Weapon Swing Timer?
---
so when the bar resets / hits 0 , u press Sinister Strike?
---
source? sounds awesome to read about
---
We got spinal tap and onslaught tonight!
---
I remember an entire raid of people making a "pilgrimage" here during the Blizzcon demo
---
Mage, there are whole guides about mages leveling without quests or instances. Just aoe farm mobs. Ez
---
just because it doesn't hit for as much as you think doesn't make it useless. there are some applications for it you're just thinking narrowly.
---
DPS only gets HoTs they dont deserve any of the good stuff.
---
Yeah I agree with you
---
Youll notice an insanely high increase to all pvp. Everything will become more scarce and prices will climb. Id strongly suggest holding onto all of whatever youre gathering now until adlfter its removed, even cheap stuff like heart of fire or whatever is now several gold compared to 40s
---
They came out in chunks throughout the patches.
---
The shaman trinket before the shaman "revamp" was insane. It benefits from all talents related to mana spring so back when you had evertide(think it was called) that increased the duration of mana spring by 10 sec it also worked on the trinket.
---
Trinket was the equivalent of the mp5 trinket off Only for the entire party.
---
The mage one give mp5 lol.
---
Yes and it's stupid, why they actually patched the game to be worse to appease morons that actually think buggy gameplay, and that's what it is, is better I'll never understand.  Why not mandate everyone play on 15 inch CRT monitors and 56k dial up too, it's equally as stupid.
---
Confirmed. Video posted in this thread
---
Because you could for example make the flag in WSG (a battleground that is a capture the flag mode) huge so you could spot it from everywhere.
---
This mentality seems to be quite prevalent in classic - " am worried I'm getting left behind". That's what ruined the later expansions imo. Everyone felt they NEEDED to log in every day just to keep up. Heaven forbid you play the game to have fun. How dare you! lol
---
I honestly wouldn't worry about this stuff. Some people rush, some people don't. In the end, there will be plenty of time to do whatever. There will always be guilds and people doing end game stuff imo.

Scrizyjumjum salutes you sir.

I don‚Äôt use any guides or add ons. Occasionally I look up a quest on wowhead if I get lost. I always manage to level faster than most people I know. I work a lot so I‚Äôm not in the first wave of no-lifers but I‚Äôm sure as shit in the second.
---
There‚Äôs no magic pill for questing. You might shave off a bit here and there by combining them in exactly the right way, but that doesn‚Äôt take into account when you might your dungeon group or go on some advice mission to STV for a war, or level your prof based on gold income etc.
---
Think for yourself.
---
Life‚Äôs for living, not following some manual.
---
it fucks with the game files which are blizzard's property. i don't really have a more nuanced answer than that but you don't need one since anything beyond that devolves into ethical bickering which is fine but the policy is the policy, period.
---
What is enchanting and disenchanting in wow, wat can I do with those in a layman's terms as I'm not a native English speaker.
---
I hadn't played this xpac. So I don't know if it's here,  but class immersion, and unbalanced pvp with pvp gear tiers and rewards again.  I like being able to feel stronger when I grind pvp to get gear.
---
I'll respond to whomever I please even if they are some whinny child who won't even present their argument.
---
Sure, but up to 30 days later with no idea what that item is worth before then. It might go up, but a lot of things like the DM books and such will almost certainly be a lot cheaper in a months time as everyone has them and the demand dries up.
---
&gt;You also run into a lot of priests who have no idea what Fade is (reduces threat by a lot)
---
And many that know of its existence don't understand how it works since tooltip can be unclear if you don't know how threat works.
---
When cast, fade drops the threat you have by a fixed amount and you get the threat back once buff ends. During this time you generate threat as normal so shadow priests need to stop dps and let the tank build aggro.
---
I'd rather you garrote than stun. Warriors need to get hit to build rage, and proc revenge.
---
Friends and guildies, man.
---
And again, every DPS priest and mage is also competition.
---
Lol right
---
the fuck
---
I think Blizzard classified that as gambling at some point though.
---
Sheep healers tank adds pop sheeps one by one with a rotating tank. Smooth, easy, idiot proof unless hunters multishot.

My guild disbanding because we couldn‚Äôt defeat cthulu haha
---
As a Druid I have no idea. Mash your keyboard. Watch the dueling tournaments in YouTube maybe
---
What class do ya Play
---
The issue I see is because blizz isn't putting anything in the pot, even the guaranteed prize isn't funded from blizz. They should have kept the guaranteed pool and added more from the sales. Yes the pool is a large pool but the interest in the tourney is huge. To me it feels like they are putting it on the back burner, matches played behind the scenes, and not putting in x amount for prizes kinda sucks.
---
Rogue is a very effective grinding class. You won‚Äôt be able to get some of the best swords but it is still solid. Go UD for extra up time with cannibalism.
---
Well you see the problem is healing is currently trivially easy. So healers trying to not fall asleep want to be top of heal meters and fast heals are best for that.
---
The only time you cast the slower more efficent heals is near the end of a fight when everyone is starting to be low mana and you decide its maybe time to play seriously. Or you just chug a mana potion and keep Flash Healing.
---
We had a resto shaman take it, and I, as another reesto shaman, was wondering wtf he was doing.  Shortly after he changed up to becoming a totem twister.  I just kind of prefer either going full resto, or ele/resto hybrid.  But I guess that's kind of a testament to this post.
---
The community didn't ask for batching, everyone hated it and wanted Blizzard to remove it. I don't know what kind of out-of-touch Facebook groups you hang out in, but the pserver community, the reddit community and the streamer community (aside from bald, and his entire chat was pretty much against him) all agreed that spellbatching was garbage and has no place in WoW in 2019.
---
Ahh true.
---
Thanks
---
"Logs don't mean a fucking thing so long as the boss dies, stop trying to win the little box on the side of your screen at all costs." - Change *my* mind.
---
Like.. who cares? Seriously. I like it when I do well on the metres and I often come first. But sometimes I don't... and that's OK as well. Last week on rags our tanks all got punted due to a positioning error and I got aggro. Evasion didn't cut it, I got turned in to paste, ended up like 26th on damage. But guess what? It gave the tanks time to recover, get back in position, and the boss died. Wanna guess how many fucks I give about a low score on the little box? Zero. 
---
Logs/metres are good for identifying problems and areas of improvement in groups/raids. Great tool, but they aren't the point of the game.

&gt;On a caster centric group you'll have the casters drink anyways so there won't be a diffrence in downtime if the healer is using mana to dps.
---
Laughs in warlock.
---
In my opinion healers should avoid dpsing and keep my third resource bar as full as possible.
---
Cause I know what mobs drop quest items and which ones don't.
---
In most dungeons I don't even bother to loot.
---
Yeah in dungeons you need to slightly care about what you are doing. In raids you dont so you just spam Flash Heal to top the healing meters.
---
"Then why isn't she healing this run?" quits the party.

"Layering is ruining the game and needs to be stopped immediately!"

you weren't expecting to get married?
---
Shaman here. I'll take whatever random spell caster, melee dps, and tank gear I can get my hands on. 
---
Enhance is currently my main spec but I do have a dream of going ele so I've been stocking up on SP items. Enhance has just been easier to gear since I often have fewer people to roll against and more of the BiS, or close enough, gear was from quests or crafting.
---
Tank gear, mostly weapon and shield, for when I pull agro from a WF crit to help my odds of surviving. Though sometimes I do tank things like mara for friends. Also plan on trying out a build around argent defender shield with thorium spikes for mass pulls in low level dungeons. Not sure how well it will work but I want to give it a go. 
---
Resto gear I don't try much for. Mainly just if I win off a greed roll. I did resto in BC and WotLK and hated it. (Was just to help out my guilds.) Its play style just didn't suit me.
---
Wait you died to a lowbie FERAL druid?  Just keep slowing /rooting every time they shift and they'll eventually go oom.  Use r1 frostbolt.
---
Against a good caster druid who max ranges you and never let's you get more than a fireblast off you should never win.
---
Can I ask what server you play on? I'm alliance on skeram and even I don't think it's that bad, although I do agree that it often feels like a futile battle and the majority of my deaths have been from the horde realizing I'm the only alliance member in sight and dogpiling me.
---
It's the sub. Never see guildies or randoms whining the way I do here.
---
It's also worth noting that in that case you should probably just let the people that already bought it roll if you're using dkp.  Or roll again if not.  Nobody ever thinks about this, but some people like to pve enchant 1 and pvp enchant the other.  Instead everyone just automatically chalks it up to being a loss, which is a bit unfortunate.  Don't get me wrong, it should absolutely go to someone who doesn't have first.  But until nexus crystals, this will at least provide some value.
---
Also ai would just say that the wowhead BiS guides are often wrong and I would doublecheck every item slot manually.
---
Bears kind of have a U curve.  They start strong.  They're not so good in the middle.  Then towards the end they start becoming really strong again.  It's honestly kind of a good idea to let the bear tank rag/ony if you have one available.
---
This will be one of your hardest match ups. So you have engineer? You have to utilize it. Next, you need to use frostbolt rank 1 to make him oom. Nova as well. Utilize your instant casts to damage him and then block dots, bleeds, etc.
---
Getting my epic flying mount in TBC after farming gold for months
---
Lol working on another now- I don‚Äôt think as good but we will see.
---
I use a shield when my threat it good enough to not be passed =D
---
Check out your server's subreddit and discord channel to see if there are any guild recruitment posts.
---
They spawn in the same few locations in a zone, once every hour or so, in like 4 zones total. Which is insanity when you think about it... that's 4 of them per hour per server *if* they're picked the second they spawn. 
---
That means you only get a *maximum* of ~170 Black Lotus' per server per week. And anybody who wants to use a flask needs one? Like.. that's insane. No wonder almost nobody used them in vanilla.
---
We don't have any orc warriors they're all trolls and taurens no joke lol
---
How effective is it vs voone's / might gloves? Huge? I do have a shit load of money so I can buy both flurry and edge.
---
okay thats just raids..
---
There's a lot of problems using it as a shaman.  As already mentioned, mp/5 isn't really very good until fights are longer.  Additionally, most resto shamans will not even be specced to be able to use 2 handed maces or axes, so they will need to alter there spec in order to even use the weapon. I'm not as knowledgeable for druid though.
---
batching &lt;3
---
No, on retail I would take action quickly because of the lack of travel times. In classic I'll be more lenient because it's more effort to find a new group. 
---
I am always the party leader and if someone purposely acts like a shit more than once I remove them and ask them in /s if they are ready to behave. Only happened once and they got a reinvite. No problems after that
---
That‚Äôs not how BGs work.  Horde will have queues and Allianxe will get instant BGs every minute of every peak hour.
---
I use IceHUD if you like that style.
---
While Nost lagged at 32K, it was perfectly stable at ~15K when compared to classic, which is more than most realms have on classic today. If Blizzard doesn't fix it after the first fights over worldbosses in a month or two, they probably won't do it at all. People have asked for a solution on retail since they fucked it up in WoD and they still haven't talked about "fixing" anything. Hey, at least Classic will be and excellent template for the next big private server.
---
Not gonna happen.  The best Blizz could come up with was pushing DM up.  They don't fucking care.
---
I'm really worried about picking up my blue sapphires now for lionheart. Gonna farm up and try to buy what i need this weekend.
---
well Devilsaur prices haven't gone up in Blaumeux so nah, things are okay
---
I guess videogames really do make people dumber hug
---
Golden Pearls were selling for 30-40g in vanilla on my server, so it's not too out of whack.
---
I should have stuck to my original instincts to roll Paladin. Was randomly inspired to play Horde Priest healer after watching Hydramist, and kinda regretting it now.
---
Whelp
---
Yeah, people tend to see mark as hostility. It is a prep to you initiating an attack. It also lasts a really long time making the mark just that much more annoying to the person receiving it.
---
Sure, you can do MC in full greens.  The point is that +heal is far more advantageous in this tier than other stats.  But just by the nature of being in those guilds, you'll be acquiring the optimal gear anyway.  My shaman already has about half the best +heal gear already for this tier.  
---
After that, it'll be fun trying to get some of the meme gear to play with other specs.  For example, I took a week or so where I played with a real tanky build, which was a lot of fun.  And it'd be a lot more fun if I started building a real gear set to do it.  Which coincidentally will also have a lot of carry over as a pvp set.
---
Except that camp is massively farmed by a shitload of people all the time on my server, so it really doesn't matter where you go.
---
NA had a lot more tourists. Both NA and EU has about 40 realms and about half of the EU realms are still layered.
---
Didnt know cloud servers runs without hardware!
---
True on the 5 rule. Wonder why the leveling  guide I was following recommended it. I'll have to double check that. I did notice a big improvement switching to whale suffix gear, but maybe mostly just the stam boost that helped.
---
It‚Äôs 3 days bro. Not 30.
---
I remember that quest, I had to leave and came back early morning one day to get it. Was still people there just not as many.
---
I've been doing some dungeons and PUG raids with bears. They were strong in Strat, UBRS, Onyxia and MC. Donutwine and Lunessa from Zandalari Tribe, my favorite bears. Cheers if you read this :D
---
\- Lio
---
wtf
---
Lol there's NO way 35% are female, buddy.
---
plus no poison or lock picking
---
He can be done in one pull after Incendius so any run that kills him can often be talked into killing him like a Lava for example.
---
Thanks for reply. Havent tried your macro as i found this addon Errorfilter that does what i needed.
---
YOU DIDNT HAVE EPIC PVP BATTLES IS THIS EVEN CLASSIC!!!?!??!????!??!??!?!?!??!??!?!!!?!?!
---
The important thing to remember is that some fights really are pure fire damage.  Or at least close enough that the primary concern is boosting your FR and not the normal tanking stats.  So as others have mentioned, at least for your fr tank set, those are good.
---
u dont need to flask for MC / Ony LUL
---
As a hunter how often should I be switching pets?
---
Yeah fuck that noise, my mindset same as yours. Need BoEs is the way to go.
---
It might not seem like it but majority of people still haven't hit 60 yet.
---
one of the big reasons i cancelled my wow classic subscription and sent all my gold to a friend, why bother waiting for phase 2? we're getting scammed here by a bunch of money grabbing fucks (blizzard).
---
some random russian guy hosting out of his garage is doing a better job on optimizing a server for mass pvp then multi billion dollar company is doing... this has been going on since beta and still not fixed... i don't believe they care enough to fix it until phase 2.

world pvp in Tauren mill, simply the most fun I've ever had in a game.
---
Lvl 45 with more than enough for my epic mount twice over and i dont even consider that insane
---
Oh COD is only 3 days? I haven't left one that long, thought it was the same as regular mail.
---
Still, prices can change in even a few days. I sold an alch recipe the other day for 100g, it's now selling for 25g. That's one hell of a drop in a short amount of time.
---
&gt; By giving a BOE to someone, you are effectively giving them gold
---
Eh, defending against ninjas is one thing, (which might make this necessary). But I think the economic argument might not hold water- look at it from this perspective: 
---
Supposing we're only talking about random BOE drops, (from going through dungeons or world quests), you're not giving the recipient gold. In one transaction it might appear that way, but statistically I think it evens out:
---
The drops are already randomized in the software, so as time goes by, everyone has more or less the same odds of seeing a drop for their class. So, over days and weeks of playtime the loot should spread out roughly evenly if everyone only needs on things they actually need. 
---
So everyone needing on everything has no economic benefit to anyone, because the drop type was already randomized.  Applying another random roll to decide yet again who gets something, might change the recipient on this round, but it isn't  productive because it doesn't increase your overall odds for loot long term. 
---
Suppose you're a warrior and everyone is needing on all BOEs - just because you now have a 1/5 chance of winning say, the dropped Priest's Cloak of Awesomeness, the next time an upgrade for you gets randomly dropped, your odds of looting it remain 1/5. 
---
OTOH if you say it goes to the appropriate classes if they need, and there's five of you, if the priest gear drops, and he needs it, he gets it. Taking into account only needing on drops for the classes in the group, that means his chances of having it drop and getting it were still 1/5, and the warrior's similarly remains 1/5.
---
So while I think 'need'ing is a valid strategy to prevent ninja looting, I think worrying about who's giving gold or taking gold when you're already on the receiving end of a random process is probably not worth your time.
---
All this changes of course if we're talking about running say, only one dungeon over and over that has a lopsided Loot distribution that favors one class.
---
So long as it doesn't drown out all the "OMG HE NINJAD MY PRE BIS!" Posts, those are really really valuable posts that this sub NEEDS! /facetious.
---
Btw a full BRD takes about two hours without wipes for a group of non 60s.
---
My favorite memory was finding my first BoE rare on a turtle in shimmering flats. I was so excited to wear my tigerstrike mantle, and then I found out it's worth a lotttt of gold for twinking. Oops!
---
This LITERALLY happened to me today on my lvl 47 rogue and he was lvl 48. Uncanny. I popped him btw
---
CAT DURID IS 4 FITE
---
sheep 4 healers
---
kill 1 melee
---
then kill the 4 healers 1 by 1
---
then kill the last 3 melee 1 by 1
---
but to be fair, our guild seems to have a disproportionately large number of tanks.
---
there's contention about this. pservers included BoE epics in junkboxes but in classic people think this isn't necessarily the case.
---
Of course it's druid. You look like the person who wants to play everything at once, what other class could it be! :D
---
Which was a limitation dictated by technology back in the day.
---
This is 2019.
---
Let's also artificially cap FPS at 30 and make running thru IF and Org take 10 years while your computer takes 10 seconds to load the next frame cause everyone was playing on toasters back then.
---
Oh that sounds dumb but batching doesn't? Unbelievable.
---
I'm a mage btw. Have dual shaped maybe 3 times since launch. Totally worth it for completely screwing over every facet of combat thousands of times a day /s.
---
Well I'll try that next time. I don't think getting killed by a lvl 53 is something I can live down
---
That's a kick.
---
Really depends on the group. I raid with a full guild so loot rules are specified. If you‚Äôre going to do a pug raid it‚Äôs best to ask about loot rules and have the raid leader specify because if they set rules and break them Blizzard will take action against them.
---
The phantom blade. For me, one of the best looking sword you can have while leveling
---
Usually you use some variation of DKP or similar systems. You earn currency by showing up to raids and then spend it in various vays for items. Usually there is some moderation to prevent stupid things like people spending dkp on items that only look cool for them, but are actually good for others.
---
Righteous Orbs are usually all greed. They are cheap enough so people dont ninja them. Also sometimes they are reserve.
---
Tier 0.5 for rogues (4-set) can substitute half your gear in Naxx and you will almost do the same DPS. Right now people are using shadowcraft 6-set and it's almost equal to being fully decked out in raid epics. Tier 0.5 would completely break rogues and ensure that they're way stronger than they should be until phase 5, as only 5/5 T2.5 or Naxx geared is comparable to the T0.5 set for rogues.
---
To be fair this was not in the open world, but rather party or raid setting.
---
Naked female nelf, check. Furies, check. Table dancing, check. It's Goldshire I know!
---
Or Raptor / tiger when ZG is released!
---
For pvp mounts, I remember at the time of BC pre patch I could ride a war raptor but not sure if it was an addition of the prepatch of if it was possible before
---
what up earthfury
---
changing stance has a seperate cooldown from the gcd, it's one press and instant if you macro it. The real reason why it's clumsy is because fury tanks don't have tactical mastery so they drop their rage if they're caught in the wrong stance and can't intercept if they're knocked while in defensive stance
---
Resto Shaman, priest, or paladin
---
It's true to an extent. People know that there's a limited amount of players and they will only run certain dungeons so much before not setting foot in ever again.
---
It happened way back in 2006 and will happen again.
---
I'll vanish it instead filthy pleb
---
... wyvern sting was on the same diminishing returns as sap and poly and it's a poison. They didn't change it to a physical so that it couldnt get abolished off by a druid in arena.
---
Hm alright so it's literally unreplacable until what naxx?
---
&gt;News flash DPS: It takes me 3 melee swings at 1.6 speed so 4.8 seconds for one single sunder.
---
This is why I continually adjust gear to not have too much mitigation so I can get enough rage from taking damage. I also generally open with dual wielding (would go 2h if I had one) for even more initial threat and switch to shield as soon as I feel I have the nessesary threat.
---
What's this then, eh?
---
My favorite memory was waking up to a Challenger title in Wotlk. I was 14 during the time and keyboard turning while having my skills binded to the numberpad. Highest I reached during that season was 1700 so I wouldn't have imagined to get the title. Oh did I rock it with pride.
---
There is no "going back" since I've never played retail.
---
Do you play enhancement shaman? I hope you do lol
---
Hide yo kids, hide yo wife and hide yo husband coz they screenshottin erbody out here.
---
Your comment isn't disagreeing with his. You didn't GIVE AWAY the axe. He won the roll.
---
GIVING AWAY for free an expensive BoE when everyone worked for it? Entitled kids.
---
For me I think it'd be getting the hang of kiting for the first time and taking down Ursius in Winterspring, just me and my pet and layers upon layers of snow. I felt like I was experiencing what it meant to be a hunter for the first time.
---
thats not bis for mage so he can suck it .. gratz on it. bis for mage is briarwood reed + eye of the beast
---
Hahahaha fucking gold
---
You're an idiot because they left wyvern sting as a poison and gave it diminishing returns. So get your facts straight.
---
You dont.
---
Paladin weapon.
---
Is there a good interface or addon to show me who my target is targeting?
---
I grinded dungeons from lvl20 not gona lie it was a rough time but like others have said I set daily goals for myself, I felt that helped alot because at some times it felt like a chore to do but with my goal in mind I feel as if it motivated me do grind threw them boring parts and now being lvl60 100g off my epic mount got a few nice epics its safe to say Im glad I stuck to it because its well worth all the blood sweat and tears.  Dont give up yet you are so close .
---
If you‚Äôre in your pre raid bis your hp and mana will be low, best off getting necropile set and some other more pvp suited items and use them when in the world. Swap to your pve stuff in an instance or raid. 
---
Not gonna lie it‚Äôs a very hard match up, you run them out of mana once and they can innervate and you have to do it over again. A larger health and mana pool will help you a lot, don‚Äôt panic about the spell damage too much, more often then not it‚Äôs an outlast battle more so then a 1 shot battle.
---
50 cent army must be working for Blizzard.
---
Pretty much, there are some items later that offer weapon skills, but not to the same extent offering 3 different kind of weapons. And I made a small mistake in my previous comment. that is going from 300-305 weaponskill but you're going from 300-307 so the increase in glancing blow damage is actually 28% so even better!
---
Take green/blue/purple items, and destroy them to make crafting materials. Use those materials do put enchants on gear.
---
Don‚Äôt really see how it‚Äôs a retail mentality. Everyone loves to have fun getting go ham and get their numbers, regardless of retail or classic. But you can always cycle who gets the parse on these fights, while the others handle mechanics, to keep people having fun.
---
I mean slow tanks are the most annoying thing ever. If the pulls are just 1-2 mobs, any dps class can cc/kite and tank it themselves. You would think tanks would want to go fast to get the shit done n over with.
---
What the others have said is good advice. Having got both a mage and a druid toon, I can confirm that making them oom would probs be the best strategy. Shapeshifting costs an absurd amount of mana and when they start running low they will inevitably start spamming moonfire with whatever they have left. From there, you should be able to keep distance and burn them down into the ground.
---
But also easier said than done. If they get the drop on you and apply all their rips etc before you even know what's happening, could be difficult. Just try and get as much distance as possible lol
---
Not even a "retail mentality". It's usually just players that are little bit above average and gets cocky because of it. Same shit occurs in all games.
---
I'm in a very good guild and we clear MC in under 2 hours. Everything is FFA (only guild member raid) but mage equip doesn' drop tht much for us. I have cleared MC now 5 times without getting any item. I farmed every BiS and have around 340 spellpower. I'm starting to get really frustrated and don't know what to do. I see people that raid in PUGs and now have better gear than me...
---
Plus early start at farming bantok sash
---
I tank all the time on my warrior. It‚Äôs really not as hard as reddit makes it out to be imo. In my experience the shitty DPS reddit talks about are the outliers. I‚Äôve only had 2 DPS that made me tell them to chill out. 1 chilled out the other ended up leaving. Most dps are fine to go my pace and their mistakes are easily corrected.
---
Sounds like a perfect place for sleeper cells from the  Burning Legion to hide out üëÄ
---
Both are only from the Enchanting profession.  Disenchanting (DE) is taking a magical item and breaking it down in enchanting resources (dust, orbs, shards). Enchanting is taking those resources and imbuing an item with a permanent buff, like +5 Spirit on your bracers or something.
---
Deep resto blows for anything other than healing.
---
We had prot tanks not fury tanks. Maybe I just need to help them setup a macro. Thanks for the info that should help our next rag clear.
---
There are a lot of good memories throughout the game, but my favorite probably being when I first joined a raiding guild.  Joined in TBC, playing as a mage, and the first fight I got to do was Mage tanking Gruul :).   Fight was incredible, and I was permanently hooked.
---
&gt;Transmut recipe are around 80 gold and any essence doesn't sell higher than 15 on mine
---
That would mean that you could make 13-14g of profit each day, would take less than a week for you to be in the green. I would buy as many as i could and start leveling alts to 35.
---
Those flasks will be the best gifts u could get
---
Nice interface... you don't even know how much people of your raid are still alive.
---
Different strokes for different folks. Some people only care for a boss to die, others like to perform as well as they can (and see how they compare to others) while killing the boss. Much of classic raid is and will be dreadfully boring, you have to do something to spice it up and keep interested. Pushing parses for many is an easy avenue to keeping interested during these snoozefests.
---
Edgemasters is your BiS until end of AQ
---
Enchanters can add additional stats to weapons and some armor pieces. Green items and higher can be disenchanted into enchanting mats.
---
With world buffs, consumables and buffs from party members, critical strike luck and gear difference it's hard to compare unless you are stacked. I would bother if there would be something like even field but there is none. Dedicating time to farm all available consumables which could boost my DPS and scheduling Onyxia buff would take much more time than it's worth for toping logs. My opinion though, do what is fun for you. I like comparing myself to people with same class in raid. For example I learned how much better is sharpening stone over poison in Molten Core, at least on some bosses and trash packs. Now, not sure but min/maxing would be to apply poison before every vulnerable boss fight in downtime while I just use sharpening stones (not even elemental ones, we don't have plans for these yet and price on AH is too big compared to mats) for entire MC and poisons for Onyxia for example.
---
I always assumed it was more like metsubushi, which would make more sense as it doesn't take 10 seconds to get dirt/sand out of your eyes.
---
I was a level 39 shaman in the Thousand Needles, running into Feralas to see what that green zone was all about.
---
A ?? level Paladin with Res Sickness pops up at the graveyard.
---
We fight for 10 minutes, damaging, healing, back and forth and forth and back, and we are both OOM and Low on HP when his Res Sickness wears off.
---
And then, outta nowhere, some dildo of a Night Elf hits me with an Aimed Shot and steals the kill.
---
I play the game because I enjoy PvP and for PvE I love seeing the progress my character makes. Seeing your logs get higher every time you get a new piece of loot is proof that your character is progressing and getting stronger.
---
Joanas guide is shit anyway if you are not a hunter.
---
You don't need an add-on. It's in the interface options
---
The odds for that are around 0.7% if the drop rate from WoWHead is accurate.
---
More like &lt;Morons of Warcraft&gt;
---
They go for 20g on my server now.
---
Yeah now u can goto the retirement home where u belong
---
Just recently, I won Eye of Divinity and just received Benediction.
---
Haha, sounds fun :D
---
That is some next level struggle xD lol
---
Then make this exact video when it's actualy medium not full during peak time.
---
&gt;Be a fucking decent human being.
---
Yes, be a decent human being and give everyone an equal shot at an item that is equally valuable for everyone in the group instead of grasping at whatever bullshit rational you can find to justify you being gifted a sack of gold.
---
Its because priest trinket is pre-bis and most other class trinkets suck.
---
I try to do both, look cool and be strong. It is possible with Rogue tier sets fortunately :D
---
Not ultra rare but elemental fire currently sells for 4.6g.
---
Wake up, dude. Classic plus is never happening.
---
Might sound lame to most people but my most memorable moment in my WoW history was back in WotLK when I started. The first time I entered raid; ICC. Never seen so many people working together to kill a boss. It truelly was the moment for me when I fell in love deeply.
---
Even if it won‚Äôt hold agro with a full set of dots you can still offload a lot of damage onto the void and get that CoA into its final ticks which is where you definitely get the most mana efficiency.
---
my alt is a resto shammy and I love it, good heals and plenty beefy enough!
---
Yeah fire elementals are an exception, I always loot those.
---
I mean if he's in your face with the level difference you should shit on him.  He can't have more than a few shifts  before he's oom at that level.  They have no interrupt except feral charge so you should always be able to get r1 frostbolt off very easily.
---
Yea true, should have made that more clear that some dungeons are for the really high levels mb
---
It's the most consistent
---
DM could net you more than ZF but you can also have several shit runs
---
can someone else weigh in on this? lol
---
Yes please. Literally over half my guild has not logged in the last 3+ weeks, and I'll likely be quitting soon as well unless I can transfer to another server where some of my other friends are still playing.
---
So much wrong
---
Well at least you dont have queue times during peak hours (although it's a lot better now).
---
Its the best 2h ingame, until naxx you wont need any weapon for pve.
---
TY for the response :) 
---
Hmmm. I can't find anything on that - unless you mean :  [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/dejaclassicstats](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/dejaclassicstats)  . I have that one, and is a good add on. But I'm looking for something that when I compare a piece of gear to what I'm wearing .. it shows the +/- stats to what the gear would give me if I swapped it.
---
Holy paladin: fast and short heals, buffs, auras, and can wear whatever. Can be kited in pvp but have good livability and versatility.
---
Holy/Discipline priest: Heal all day. Lifesaving. Plenty of cool tricks and spells. Squishy though. And much more useful in a group than solo.
---
Healdruids: best healing over time abilities, has the ability to rez a teammate mid-fight and give mana to others. Versatile in pvp, but unlike a paladin can only do one thing at a time (tank, dps, or heal)
---
Resto shaman: good healers I guess, less experience with them since when vanilla wow was live I played alliance.
---
If your guild uses DKP make the summons cost a,small portion of DKP.
---
Here is the reply on my ticket http://imgur.com/a/BhjHpI3
---
Look up your pre raid best in slot gear to get ready for the raids.
---
It's not in WoW, but in EVE Online my corporation through a "Stag" party, where we went out and fought people for like 3 hours for no reason. It was awesome. That was the last time I flew with most of those people.
---
It's experiences like these that make the game worth it.
---
After reading the comments, this is actually a commen thing. Dying in a place where the game ¬´cant find the spirit healer¬ª you‚Äôre ending up in either westfall or the barrens, faction dependent.
---
Nost had over 12-13k online on a single realm.. so no, not even remotely close to 90% of the server population was in one place. 
---
It looks like the entire population was in 1 place, because it looks like so many people. But the truth is that Nost just had a fuck ton of people..
---
And it worked just fine.
---
Once you get a bit higher you can start doing brd and eventually lbrs and all the max dungeons.   It's good to start before 60 because you're gonna run them at 60 foe prebis anyway so you're just double dipping and getting exp too.
---
I would like to say no, but it seems not viable since almost every class needs them.
---
Ofc in DM it is better, i said in raids the bosses have almost 0 armor with sunder, faerie, cor, annihilator.
---
Yes, when the main hand bar resets, use sinister strike or eviscerate.
---
Whats wrong with his name?

Your boss here (Dack). Nice karmafest, Bowman, I'm impressed. And again, congrats mate.
---
For those asking: We are a guild on Gandling - Horde, named Tarren Mill Trading Co. If you'd like to join us, give us a whisper. The requirements are non existent, just don't be Mr. og Mrs. Assydouche.
---
Cool
---
You're not in RUIN are you?
---
So what if class quests are an exception? Just to make all classes kinda equal.
---
This is important to point out because you typically aren‚Äôt fighting orange mobs when leveling due to a host of other reasons. It does save you a boatload if money at 60 though because you aren‚Äôt forced to buy and wear edgemaster‚Äôs handguards
---
You get more exp from party bonus - requires full party of 5 to get bonus.
---
But I make it work, [right](https://media.giphy.com/media/bEVKYB487Lqxy/giphy.gif)?

Are you being feared? If youre feared, you wont hold aggro until you drop fear. On top of that, people who arent feared get aggro priority over you. If you are being feared, as a bear, youre kind of limited based on your factions options--fearward on ally and tremor for horde.
---
The people who stayed on realms with huge queues to get have no right to complain about this...you had plenty of opportunities to switch servers.
---
Also layered
---
I've got a re-spec into talents question, [the top is my current talents](https://imgur.com/a/eRsSosE) and the bottom is what I want to switch to, since I'm going double swords route. Would this switch be worth the 5g?
---
I got this feeling a week ago. Girlfriend went out of town for the weekend and I had the place to myself. Was looking forward to getting on and playing all weekend but when I did I just roamed around and didn't really do anything.
---
Just set a goal for yourself. Getting to level X, start questing in a new zone or finally finish those quests in a certain zone you haven't done yet, do a dungeon you haven't done yet or you've been meaning to do, get some new gear, get a profession up to a certain level, just go fishing.
---
Eventually you'll hit a point where you will have some other goal in reach and you'll look to hit that. It helps get that drive and determination going, which is what makes the game fun. You just have to get over that hump of nothingness or boringness that's holding you back and find something to look forward to.
---
If that doesn't work then maybe a break will do you good. Step away for a few days and play something else or focus on another hobby. Eventually that desire to play will come back and you'll have that drive again.

Tell the mage to suck a dick because it's not his BiS, he has better trinkets

Source: I am a mage
---
I'm on a nvme SSD and I had 10 second long load times. Deleted the cache and was down to 2 seconds. It's not a hardware issue
---
Phantom Blade. You can make it as a blacksmith. It's solid for pvp and cosmetically it's one of the few swords that holster on your character's back.
---
&gt; So I've leveled my Shaman I started with at launch from 0-52, and I've really enjoyed the leveling for the most part. The only time I began to dislike it was when I specced elemental at 40 and my playstyle completely changed.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; In both pvp and pve playing an Enhancement Shaman was very fun, and it was always a challenge using the right totems in a fight and winning against pretty much everybody if you used your kit right. As an elemental, however, you could be easily interrupted with spells and time to outplay your opponent with totems since you die so fast. Don't get me wrong, I completely understand why people like playing elemental shamans, but I just don't think that playstyle is for me, and sadly from what I've heard, Enhancement Shaman's aren't very viable late game.
---
&gt; Is there any other class that feels like an Enhancement Shaman? I know you won't get the awesome windfury crits with another class, but I love the playstyle of weaving spells into my melee hits and using totems to outplay my opponents.
---
&gt; TLDR: I don't like the playstyle of elemental and want to be able to play something that feels like an Enhancement Shaman while being viable late game
---
Shamans are viable late game, you've fallen into someone's misconstrued perception of the game's difficulty.
---
Gator bite does more damage than whirlwind - it‚Äôs better. Though it‚Äôs basically the first non boe epic axe that you can use that‚Äôs better than whirlwhind
---
you can turn on a setting so that interface clicks will do a /who scan. My scans usually take a few hours to complete.
---
Okay, but that still doesn't mean they changed it because of dwarf stoneform. That's just fucking stupid to even claim.
---
I'd like to possibly join you guys. Who do I whisper?
---
What does parse mean
---
Leatrix Plus has an option for this.
---
It aint rocket appliances.
---
Okay so it has Diminishing Returns in PvP. But that doesn't mean jack shit for stoneform, and they didn't change it due to players complaining about racials.
---
I said this in the context of a DPS who kept pulling trash despite being told not to do so.
---
That was the whole point of layering in the first place.
---
Restopot on everyone and u need just a few dispels;)
---
I‚Äôm surprised that name is allowed. It‚Äôs Swedish for ‚ÄúThe homosexual bank‚Äù or rather ‚Äúgay bank‚Äù
---
Pretty funny though.
---
Bis is v different for dps vs tank. Choose one or both?
---
If ur upfront and call out what your after u can potentially tank and roll on both dps gear or tank :)
---
If you can get a hold of some other people you semi trust, even if not, Strat live Righteous Orb farming is OK. Can do round robin runs so everyone gets a few orbs, it's OK money, a run takes like 40-60 min depending on gear, usually 2-3 orbs drop.
---
DM East jump runs as others have described.
---
Might be able to do giants farming in southern winterspring, don't know how good the money is though.
---
Tyr's Hand is an option too, again, I know it's a farm spot, but I haven't farmed there myself so I can't say how good the money is exactly.
---
I hopped on a bird out of Org enroute to Tanaris. A long journey to be sure but as my bird was leaving the city, I saw someone post in trade chat that he was selling an Arcane Crystal for 40g, which was 5g cheaper than anything on the market at the time, I whispered the guy and asked if he would COD it to me, but he didn‚Äôt even entertain the idea. But like... dude... I‚Äôll buy it from you, I want my arcanite bar transmute cooling down as much as you want 40 gold. It‚Äôs a commodity. It isn‚Äôt a unique item where undercutting will cost you 100‚Äôs of gold and removing 1 seller from the market will drastically increase your chances of selling. I swear, the people who do this COD scam shit ruin that feature for the rest of us. No one trusts it anymore.
---
In what world does this prove anything? Are you retarded?
---
I agree, I am a mage and generally enjoy making water. Makes me feel like I'm contributing to the group. 
---
Farming shards on the other hand is the reason I didn't roll warlock. No one should feel bad for mages lol.
---
Coz they're farming it in a dungeon?
---
"Rip, you dont like playing on high pop servers?"
---
^Half the guild i quit to transfer to arcanite reaper.
---
Some people just like big numbers to measure their dicks with.
---
I look at my own numbers and compare to the other rogues. I want to see if I'm doing alright - and which rogue to ask for advice on how to do better. I always look through our logs after a raid night to ensure that I'm pulling my own weight.
---
I can't, there's barely any gear in MC that's actually good for us. The things that are, are heavily contested by mages and warlocks.
---
Not sure what the hate with Westfall is, it's an awesome zone. Much more lushful and tolerable than the barrens I leveled in this time around. Also Deadmines, which is one of my favorite early game dungeons.
---
The defias lore is actually really interesting, they basically agreed to help rebuild Stormwind but on the condition that they'd be rewarded once the city became prosperable again. Years had gone by Stormwind was rebuilt by them but they never received any sort of compensation for all the time and labor.. They basically became rebels. There's a bunch of quests chains that explain it pretty well. The leader,  Edwin VanCleef is the final boss of Deadmines.
---
It might  be absurd for you, but consider people wanting to play multiple classes, that have time restrictions (work, family, school,...). So by multiboxing you essentially level multiple characters at once, with slightly lowered speed.
---
Depending on how many  alts you multibox it pays off in the end. At least that's the reason i multibox and for me extra couple of 13 eur a month for that is not that much.
---
Not everyone is young with all the time in the world like they did in WoW vanilla :D
---
For raids if a boss has already been killed, zoning in will lock you.
---
Sucks, but always confirm where raid is at before you zone in.
---
Im thinking of going both herbalism and mining.  Whats the best method to track ? Any addon making it easier ? (using gather2mate for herbs now) Macro to switch tracking active ? Or bind a button to each track and spam them back and forth ?
---
Hey what would a levelling build for tanking all dungeons as ret look like? I'm new to wow and paladin and just got mine to lvl 10 tonight after hitting 60 on my main. So I'm thinking about making this pally my next character. I wanted to either heal or tank dungeons for faster groups and I was really looking to spam dungeons for most lvling instead of questing. Would it be smarter to go holy with some ret to heal or go ret some prot to tank?
---
really hard to tell just from player experience I guess because I think most women  don't make it known that they are female  and no wonder with all the horny and toxic dudes in gaming. 
---
I always find it really funny that most gamers would want a girl that plays games but then the Community in general is just shit towards girls.
---
I dont understand all of your repleys... You guys know WoW is like crack right? This guys is like: I can do it anymore, all that crack, its killing me... but I cant stop taking it... Yeah but if you just take it with little bits at a time, and take your crack like so... you can keep going man.. hang in there.. you know whats at the end of this road of crack right? A whole MOUNTAIN of crack dude! Becouse you know what? When you ding 60 you realise that gind was the fun part, now your going to run an instance 50 times to get 1 piece of gear! (I think its fun though, dont get me wrong:p). Mate, just take the break please...
---
It is acceptable if all parties agree to it. I have done this before as a tank. I'm full pre raid BiS. I know all dungeons and all pulls, and I provide a smooth and quick and safe dungeon experience. Most people are fine on ceding the potential gold from trash BoP nobody needs to try and get their gear. The item value of pre raid BiS gear could easily be anywhere from 50 to 200 gold in provided dmg/utility. Some gear might be worn for quite a while, and they might be slow to get upgrades. It is not unpopular nor selfish to ask for this as a tank
---
Honestly? Just remove shit like artifact systems, and kill titanforging/warforging and keep it gone.
---
And delay flying longer.
---
Just that, those 2 things would bring me back to retail 100%
---
Yep, if you try gouging a sapped mob, it will get a free swing on you.  It's really stupid and it's not how vanilla was....not sure why so many people are in denial and say that it's how it was in vanilla...they either didnt play a rogue in vanilla, have a terrible memory, or dont play a rogue in classic.
---
Sheep 2 healers and kill 2 elites, after that we pop the sheep‚Äôs and group up everything for cleave/aoe.
---
Healers does aoe shadow damage tho so it‚Äôs important to pre-pot greater shadow protection potion before the right and have another one ready if needed during the fight
---
I just did it today as main tank and got living bombed twice - RNG is a fickle monster
---
The first time I played wow, my friend was doing arathi basin on his undead rogue and let me try it out.. It was awesome!
---
Sheep healers aoe elites then kill healers
---
Is 25 a lot? I did over 50 runs and never got TS.
---
Level 58 rogue threatening to black list me, a fully pre raid BiS tank with some T1 gear, in Strat Live the other night because I didnt want to clear to Unforgiven because the group was doing poor dps and we wiped on trash pulls before any boss. Yep. Throw on that blacklist buddy, Im ruined.
---
&gt; If I'm not mistaken threat meters watch the combat log an add up threat based on presumed values.
---
Yes, its based on combat log data. But i think its currently just taking all of the player data and adding the values together. 
---
But i dont think its taking into account if players have things like talents that reduce aggro (maybe it can check this, not sure ?) or if boss uses a skill that reduces the targets aggro. Not a dps, so dont really have time to closely look at the threat meter, does the tank threat suddenly drop or not.
---
It's a slur for homosexual men.
---
39 warrior here. In 3 runs SM:armory I got the shoulders, Ravager and helmet from Herod. Should I quit running the instance now, all my other gear besides the weapons is in the 20s. 
---
Also, should I be ashamed with so much luck? Druid friend (heal/dps) ran with me and got nothing.
---
That's not what is happening here.  Yes we are aware that always was a thing in vanilla.  This is not that.
---
Maybe it's 25% more damage if a boss falls in 25 seconds. 
---
If your fight is more reasonable and takes a couple minutes you're probably looking at 10 to 15% more damage maximum. 
---
Popping a flask of supreme power would get you more damage, but cheaper than spending 50 gold twice - once to spec to arcane frost, once to spec to a build useful for other purposes, such as PVP, farming or otherwise. Switching talents just for the raid is a pretty hardcore thing to do, and a stupid one if you're switching talants, but not bringing in the flask.
---
Problem with roots is it's a 1.5s cast, which against a rogue might as well be an eternity.
---
Fix the fucking servers you fucking shit company, omggggg.................
---
I'll probably get flak for this.
---
But hunter is probably the hardest non-meme dps (sorry cat druids) in classic. Hunters actually have to use a tiny bit of their drain and not smash Frostbolt / Shadowbolt / Bloodthirst for 2 hours for raid
---
Those classes have abilities gated by quests
---
That's not what's happening here.  Theres a combat vanish bug in classic.
---
Getting oneshot by my friend who was 5 levels lower than me in the early levels levels after joking that paladins were "trust fund babies" (a running joke from our DnD campaign)
---
just press Need for Acuria my friend
---
low effort report this
---
That's not the same thing.
---
mods??????
---
I'd do it. More parry and Riposte followed by BF next level - all great for leveling.
---
casual talk
---
mods????
---
Are you level 20, because I doubt you are doing late game dungeon pugs if you truly think that
---
I think you gave him a good deal! I also got this the other day and was pretty happy at the time, but now the prices have plummeted and it sells for 1,5g :s
---
I'm pretty sure even trash in mc has about 4400 armor. So even with sunder ff and cor there is still some to be mitigated
---
Tank Domo, sheep all casters, kill 1 non caster, then all the casters one at a time.  Once all casters are dead and only 3 mobs left, we kill them 1 at a time then kill domo.
---
More than anything, paladins struggle in raids because they go OoM too fast. However, the Greater Blessing of Kings trick could certainly be used on certain bosses, and could potentially be the optimal way to tank a few bosses, but I don‚Äôt know for sure and I‚Äôm not a theorycrafter.
---
Oooooffff
---
Horde should be the bigger arm
---
LMAO she was salty he chose play WoW over go to dinner on HIS OWN birthday. Fuck him for wanting to do what he wants on his birthday right?
---
Mana economics 101. Losing a damage dealer makes fights longer. Longer fights = more mana spent on healing. But if that additional mana + cost of resurrection is lower than the cost of keeping damage dealer alive you should let them die. Nothing personal, just mana business.
---
I honestly hope everytime to be on tank duty when facing domo. 
---
It's breath of fresh air from the pewpew DPS.
---
This isnt the same thing that happened in vanilla. In vanilla your vanish would fail if a mob was already mid-swing as you vanished.  This is not breaking combat even if you're very far away with nothing attacking you.
---
GEHENNAS IS STILL LAYERED, BTW.
---
Bloodfang EU is very balanced
---
Why exactly are you here commenting 10 days later?
---
Nope. That doesnt work a lot of the time.
---
Wut ? Its additional content for people (that dont raid) in phases 5/6 that get barely anything new to do when the new raids are added. THOSE items arent for everyone, just like raiding NAXX isnt for everyone.
---
I just dont see why they delayed the KEY RING.
---
It has no change over the game. Just because something was released late, doesnt mean it should not have been in the game day 1
---
1 push macros are incredibly important for being a really good and effective tank
---
It still doesnt work all the time even if you're very far away.
---
Weird, I'm always alone on my way to King Gordok, there's lots of ogres but no players.
---
You're not really supposed to in, like vs shadowpriests. The way you do win is by forcing them to oom by shifting. If they know what they are doing it's pretty impossible without stun grenades.
---
Whisper me (Dack) when I'm online later today!
---
Hopefully it comes out soon though.
---
I also choose this guy's wife
---
Yeah because the priest book costs pennies. Not a couple hundred G.
---
I'm guessing they are the newest servers to be released? Kirtonos was Med on release but it's still poppin'.
---
Well you must not play a rogue now, or else youd know that batching has royally fucked up many of our abilities.
---
Looks tribal, yet futuristic.
---
That makes perfect sense, thank you!
---
Are they even different?
---
Actually if they change loot rules mid-raid but before an engagement, it's fair game in Blizzard's eyes. But at that point people might just leave (as is their right).
---
The Rake
---
Because I made a bank with that farm and now every casual is out there taking my pools and I need to vent my frustration bro
---
Yup followed suit with it, so far so good. I was figuring each talent reset would be 1G,2G,3G, etc not 1,5 immediately lmao. Next is 10G I assume?
---
sure me too. but no transmog.. and i looks like a midle age gay trap in a red hat and  alanna's embrace. even with a guild tabard i have a pink skirt.
---
Why do only the warrior have engineering in this scenario?
---
If both classes have engi a competent hunter will win 10/10 times. Warriors have less tools to close distance then hunters have to gain. 
---
In classic some classes is just a free kill, with the exception of warrior. They have no free kills. On their own it‚Äôs the worst class for pvp.
---
Think it was wrath when they gave you a 1 minute warning to gtfo or get locked.
---
Lol these are classic
---
&gt;APES and friends dominate horde at every turn
---
They don't, though.
---
if you intend using double swords then I would prolly skip endurance
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/-3200550100050150211
---
ginn-su sword looks way better.
---
I guess he‚Äôs implying slow totem... but if you have enough hunters for kitting, you don‚Äôt have an issue
---
Yes you do!
---
We gave an eye to a player who quit the game not even 2 weeks later...
---
In my guild, you would never have taken the Mageblade with that kind of gear slacking
---
Interesting. Or you could just nuke her so much as shes about to fly off that the tank isnt top threat anymore. 
---
But based on that, if you have 2 tanks (or warrs doing threat), the optimal way to do it would be stack the tank + low threat healer together doing whelps on both sides and dps can just spread out and get their threat reseted. That way both warrs are full rage, cannot get their threat reseted (as the healer is below them always).
---
Moonfire moonfire repeat
---
And worse, every time you play the game, you're just doing exactly the same thing you were doing the day before. So not only does it force you to play it relentlessly, it limits what you're doing each time you play it, particularly if you don't have a few hours to dedicate to the game each day.
---
Unless you can provide a source on statistics and give numbers and not only what people say, it is literally anecdotal.
---
There are so many things which can help you in PvP. An easy way to find great pieces would be to sift by item level on classic wowhead, and try to get the highest level pieces that seem useful for PvP.
---
Other than that, consumables, engineering, Glimmering Mithril Insignia(Blacksmithing), 100 HP arcanums, reputation rewards(timbermaw hold/argent dawn), plethora of trinkets to swap around... the list goes on and on.
---
Hopefully they ditch the dailies
---
&gt; Bosses in MC got like 3-4K armor each. BWL not sure. It applies -2k armor, so basically they will have near 0-1k.
---
Regular class debuffs give -3,395 armor reduction, so a lot of bosses have about 300 armour before BRE, and good guilds will have someone using Annihilator, so pretty much all bosses have 0 armour. Making BRE's armour debuff pretty much useless.
---
No in high / full pop servers this is layered still and you don't see as many people.
---
I came back to this after scrolling down and seeing three more exactly like this. Wtf.
---
Just use Restorative Potions! No one needs to dispel or decurse when everyone just uses that consumable =)
---
I believe that's actually a portable baby prison.
---
Adding to deathcoil is drain tanking is becoming more popular so:
---
A succ will always be out. Nice surprise when she's invisible into seduce and fear.
---
Also Female orc is BiS horde side because of 5%+25% stun res and +5% pet damage. Female because of smaller frame and best dance.
---
Mmh I never 5men dungeons with my character but there are some guides on wow head which give you a prot/heal build. Questing will be bad then though
---
fuckkkk
---
Mind Control Cap is completely different in effect than the priest's Mind Control, though. You can still buy the cap from a Gnomish engineer, though.
---
Yes, 5 g increments capping out at 50. Diminishes by 5 g per month of not respeccing, down to a minimum cap of 5 or 10 (conflicting info on this).
---
Do not do unnecessary respecs, at least not early on. Next one should (at the earliest) be after getting mount.
---
Doesn't count, as it is not exclusively craftable by gnomish engineers. A goblin engineering can craft a gnomish cloaking device :)
---
Look at all these empty souls..
---
I don't get your text in this context. Did you answer the wrong message? When I talked about righteous fury I meant improved
---
Yea sure and if u put even more dd gear on u will Generate even more.... such bs! If u wanna go for more threat u give the tank 5 more sec and not roll on dd bis gear... at some point the theorycrafting gets out of hand
---
[Voy point of view](https://imgur.com/a/AMsGaUT)
---
Look up what the pre Raid BIS gear is for both tanking and DPS as you will probably need tank gear to tank 5 man instances and DPS gear for raiding.  As a lot of people have said farming BRD is a good start because Hand of Justice as well as Savage Gladiator Chain are two of the best items for both tanking and DPSing as a warrior.
---
All I saw, when the free server migrations opened up, was people warning everyone not to jump, how stupid that would be. It's your own fault for not listening.
---
I did it at level 50.... But really just Rush it... The dungeons without it was a PITA
---
This is like going to a teams subreddit and rooting for their rival team.
---
Onyxia all resist armor ring drops. I am OT Druid and also enchanter of the guild. 
---
‚ÄúTake ring and DE later‚Äù ummm yeah gonna use that my dude but I might DE later
---
No one of the buffs you get is like a blood lust so with the right setup its really really good
---
Well it works without it if you mark targets but yeah... Rushing it is best
---
its a feature of spell batching
---
&gt; Feature
---
Need is a big term. There is really good alternatives that take 5 runs max and are only marginally worse. HoJ farming takes commitment that rivals a full time job
---
Merchant Perk. 'wink'
---
Might be a surprise to some, but many (if not most) rogues actually use the stealth advantage to avoid the fights altogether. The class is challenging and fun enough without ganking, really.
---
Here‚Äôs hoping I can win something.
---
You're an optimist!
---
World bosses are going to be shit shows. It'll probably just straight up crash most of the servers.

This us why rollong for loot is ass. DKP or Loot Council or fuck that shit.
---
No it doesnt encourage  world activities, but the opposites. Since it's impossible to farm stuff the normal way people spam and abuse dungeons
---
That's not what I'm discussing but good for you
---
Pala spams one spell and has almost infinite mana. A lot of buffs for your group.
---
Priest can do pretty much everything. 
---
Shamy has the only smart heal in the game. Also means you mostly spam chain heal. Totems offer a lot of group support.
---
Druid most efficient single target spell in the game. Druids strength is that you can do a lot of stuff with druid (tanking with the same spec for example). As a pure healer probably the weakest healer. Battle rez and innervate can save a raid from wipe.
---
Ok,
---
Been seeing tons of Molten Core posts and the drops people are getting, is that place on farm already? Is Classic Molten Core easier than the retail one?
---
&gt;It‚Äôs a straught up laggy gold dump (sappers, fire prot pots etc) and APES and friends dominate horde at every turn.
---
If you had been where that recording is from, you would know they got their asses raped, just like saladbakers did in BRM. Apes+SB did fine, until horde guilds started working together too.
---
Honestly I really like these posts and they're making me want to watch TPB again
---
Its not even bis, and its just as good for pallies
---
I started as horde to play with a friend but went to alliance as soon as i realized that friend wasnt gonna log on more than once
---
never played retail but I guess make the game fun again and not a generic "login to grind some dailies/reputaion/whatever" with clear distinction between classes and more social interaction. What I heard what people like about retail is that raids are challenging, so built on that
---
For gaining ogrimmar reputation, I naively thought that even doing starter quests in valley of trials would give me a lot of rep... but each quest gives like 10. hell the shredder paper quest in ashenvale gave 10 rep as well...

---
I‚Äôm aware, just pointing out the error in half of your comment :)
---
Just to elaborate on the fireballs.  If you have someone stack on your MT and eat the fireballs with your MT (we use our OT in RF gear.) threat only resets for the lower threat target.
---
North from grizzly explains it here, but basically burn p1/p2 with as much dps as possible.  Stack one person lower on threat than mt for p2 (ot or healer).  If you are dps/heals on p2 make sure you spread out, as you climb the threat chart you will get fireballed.  You want to eat it alone so your threat gets reset.
---
Assuming you stacked property your tank should be damn near the top, if not #1 on the threat.  We've done it this way the last two weeks. Literally took us a bit over 3 minutes to kill and lost 0 people.

It‚Äôs ok but I hate the fact you can roll on two pieces a reset... esp as a priest seeing how there are always several in any raid.  I used to come to raid with 20 but mana pots and multiple smaller ones and atleast 20 farmed demonic runes/buff food/flasks and 80 candles ... I‚Äôm done putting that kind of gold/effort into raids where I receive nothing.
---
I'm glad I'm a tank and not a poor dps stuck in suck a tank's group. That sounds like a massive waste of time and total overkill for something as simple as a dungeon.
---
Doesnt make any difference. Its about the population in that one area. If you have 200 vs 200 raid on a 400 population server, it will STILL crap out.
---
Why would you do something like that?
---
if class quests are ok, definetly warlock
---
I leveled without quests and was much faster than all my friends and as an undead I had basically no downtime since I can just lifetap and cannibalize the humanoids I grind and make bandages from their cloth
---
they did WHAT? I mean I liked stuff like "Totemic Recall" and that "Relocate Totems Spell" they added later as a QoL change, but removing them alltogether sounds like a really bad idea...
---
This is a great topic of conversation, please discuss this with me, everyone. Population has definitely gone down (I.e. way less queue times). But do you think that could be due to the fact that some people have completed MC and Onyxia multiple times and are just waiting for the next phases? 
---
It's like any game I guess; game launches, people complete current content (okay they probably don't have ALL gear, but bear with me), people leave temporarily to play other games (Modern Warfare for e.g.) game then releases a new patch (phase), those people then come back to complete this new batch of content. 
---
There are definitely some people that have quit the game for good, but those are the people that wouldn't have played WoW vanilla anyway as it's just not their kind of game (Don't like MMOs or don't like more grindy MMOs and prefer more casual MMOs I.e. retail). 
---
What do you think?
---
Ez that's how.
---
Flash bombs, 10 seconds of instant cast ground targeted aoe unbreakable\* fear, if you can't cream them in that window, then I don't know what to tell you.  
---
Feral is literally free kills to anyone with a flash bomb, and they are dirt cheap to make and brainlessly easy to farm mats for.  
---
\*may not be unbreakable, but I've never seen it break on damage.

If you want to grind mobs, then I'd say go with mage. Even if you can't start the AoE farm until 24 or 30 (I say 24 cause someone else mentioned level 24), at least you CAN AoE farm with them well. You'll hit that level range anyway, and if you do as rogue, you're not AoEing very good (they get like ONE ability that lets them hit just ONE extra mob, and it has a 2 minute cooldown). Warriors can only AoE up to 4 enemies with whirlwind if I recall correctly, and whirlwind probably has a cooldown. I can't speak much for other classes, but mages really are the best AoE class, ESPECIALLY for grinding.
---
You WILL hit 24 or 30 at some point with any class you take, so better take the one that CAN be great at farming.
---
Also with their ability to make portals to any capital city, it'll make it easier for traveling around the map.
---
How do you find your class discord? I have a discord, and so many questions on how to play my paladin
---
Counterattack &amp; Rune of the Guard captain are significantly worse than HoJ. It procs off all hits, including abilities, for auto attack damage, it‚Äôs around a 1-1.5% overall damage increase completely passive. 
---
~2% drop rate, farmed 5x per hour, you‚Äôre only spending 10h (on average) to get it, that‚Äôs not that long considering it‚Äôs BiS until AQ40
---
Ask questions. If you are new they aren't likely to give equal access to best gear. If you aren't new, raided couple of times etc then you should have equal access. Also if you have specific gear in mind ask what's the plan for it and if you are on the list of interested people. If their actions and responses aren't satisfactory - leave the guild or demand changes :)
---
He is wrong. This piece is still great both on warriors and hunters
---
If anything valuable drops I always default to waiting to see what others do before I hit need or greed
---
We pay monthly subscriptions for this?
---
Once you know all the ressource spots with gathermate in an area you can just approach them and use the right tracker to quickly determine if there is indeed a plant/vein. Afaik there‚Äòs no way to have both active at the same time.
---
Ofc, it's Arnold! :-D

I always had similar worries. I really powered trough and was amongst the earlier lvl 60ies on my server (not like week one early, but still). Now that more and more 60ies come in, I start to realize that I wouldn't have missed much besides something like 3 raid IDs. If you're not banking a million arcane crystals or black lotuses a few weeks really don't matter much.
---
Probably a melee party, but considering the most used ability of the spirit is flamestrike, which most MC mobs are immune to... yeah not great. Maybe dungeons if you are melee heavy
---
How can you say "significantly worse" and "1.5% damage increase" without feeling silly? The highest our fury can currently put out is 350 DPS. Plus/Minus. So that would be an increase of about 4DPS.
---
Genuinely interested; why 2 60s of the same class? Did you level all others to 60 and started on your second lap, or what? :)
---
still top2 pve race for rogues
---
1.5% overall for doing absolutely nothing is significant. Considering your other option is Counterattack Lodestone for +2 AP, which will maybe give you 500 damage over the course of an entire raid?
---
‚ÄúMy bags are full‚Äù

Meanwhile skinners have the same bags and multiple stacks of leather in it

Well this brings back memories.
---
Thank god i have a phome to do that
---
Go alch at 60
---
Get paid? From whom? RNG god and random epics? Mages do get a gold for a couple of stacks. That fast I cant make money farming shards. After farming shards heading back without any backspace for loot. For repairing your armor, otherwise you will be told you have to repair before the raid.
---
THAT GNOME IS GONNA FUCK A CAT
---
Question, in these situations why do people always block out the name of the person? Wouldn't it benefit everyone to see who the ninja is?
---
you clearly dont play tank
---
Retail becomes classic.
---
Rppvp servers community is just superior compared to pvp servers atleast that was my experience after a few pvp server rerolls.
---
I think they should do regular ladder / realm resets like they do with Diablo
---
I love chugging a health pot only to lose the pot, die, and incur the 60 second CD.
---
Did it while leveling; alongside with first aid and cooking.
---
Wasn't so bad. When I was bored I fished and watched a movie. Got 300 \~Level 40.
---
my shaman is a space goat, I played a mage in vanilla, so thats what im doing on classic.
---
Thats the issue however, hunters are surprisingly rare. We had to recruit a few to fill our rosters. If you want free gear roll hunter and druid.
---
[Good for you](https://imgur.com/9Pxfngh)
---
Since we are doing anecdotal experiences in this thread, game is obviously dead as you can see.
---
I'm always wowed by the amount of people who "123 summon" for Onyxia while slacking in Breckenwall Village (in Dustwallow March). I would whip their lazy asses.
---
prebis gear is 100% shit for pvp, get the necropile set and a couple of magister items
---
Elvui had an illegal license for their healcomm(not their fault from what i understand) so maybe grid had the same one as elvui and removed it for copyright reasons
---
Its always mages that throw a hissyfit, when a healer rolls on +damage item thats BIS for the healer too. Got the same comments in my levelup / pre-bis gathering. Just ignore them.
---
[Dead game indeed](https://imgur.com/9Pxfngh)
---
Hey look, I can also post anecdotal screenshots. Gj op
---
Such an obvious attempt at balance would on the other thand not be very "Classic-WoW-feel" either. If that's what we're out to achieve, we may as well overhaul the classes.
---
My friend and I where leveling alliance rogues on our alternative accounts. Swormwind and IF are a fucking mess to navigate.
---
The problem is that faction balance is really bad in most of the PVP servers, which makes the experience for the minority faction worse. The problem only gets worse with time, as the dominant faction will continue to exercice that majority, which also reflects PVE (materials become more expensive, fewer people available for recruiting, etc.). Blizzard let this happen in retail and didn't take any steps in Classic avoid it (they could have used queues and transfers as a tool to try to encourage more people into rolling Alliance).
---
Alliance outnumbered Horde in vanilla, it all changed with the inclusion of Blood Elves and now, back in "vanilla", the famous The Ratio is the other way around.
---
As what I can see you Main a rogue. I guess also you already asked brd pocket runs are one way or you can farm ores in Silithus
---
I loot the fucking corpses, sit down and drink - let them die, i dont care
---
It happens to me as well, seems like it's a problem with the game
---
Execute is like 40% of the wars dammage when done right.
---
the reason +5 is better is it increases your top end dmg of backstab/ambush , thus crits are going to be all the more deadly.
---
You had a guy from the opposite faction help you on a quest?Yesterday I had a 60 mage corpse camp me because I killed elementals for a quest..
---
I'm on gandling horde, I'd like to join up I'll msg you when I'm online, probably tomorrow
---
I was thinking, what if Apes one day come out with a announcement that they moving back to private servers, because they are more functional for world pvp, which they focus at. And they chain biggest guilds to follow after themselves. The damage that would possibly cause to activision, holy crap.
---
just use restorative potion and kill in sub 40 sec
---
The first event (a roll between 1-100) doesn‚Äôt actually impact the probability! The second event is always 1/100 to be identical to the first one! So the probability is 1% for two rolls to be the same!

I was leveling in tanaris having a grand old time ignoring people asking for tanks in /1, get a DM from one of them asking to if I can tank ZF for him, I say nah im kinda chilling rn.
---
15 minutes later, I'm done with tanaris quests for now, get another message from him asking to tank for 3 gold, pretty good for a 48 who still hasnt done any ZF quests himself, I say nah im hungry, I drive to get food, eat it, come back relog and he's still looking for one. He ups his payment and then I join.
---
My priest never got this level of desperation on any dungeon lmao

prob. dead AF if they offer free migrations to it

I could do without that to be honest

Never, I repeat, never use fabric conditioner on your keyboards. Ruins the stiffness of the keys.

Most level headed take I have seen in this sub in like whole past year.

Well as Warrior with a druid friend it's easy to get people for a group who don't compete with your loot.

I've seen Ebn (famous druid pvper) use it a lot in pvp as well.

Looks sick with the moving cogs, can't wait to get my own.

I remembered wrong, it was 448 SP, not 438. Here is my gear: [https://classic.wowhead.com/gear-planner/mage/undead/AjwAQSgKB7kCL0cDLgYFN0gGLY4HM3JIJ5kHs0kt9getCjPFCwOuDAOuDTKCDjaQTyeaB60QQs9RKiwHrRI2cg](https://classic.wowhead.com/gear-planner/mage/undead/AjwAQSgKB7kCL0cDLgYFN0gGLY4HM3JIJ5kHs0kt9getCjPFCwOuDAOuDTKCDjaQTyeaB60QQs9RKiwHrRI2cg)

In that planner it doesn't show wpn enchant +30 SP and 2 x 8 SP head &amp; leg enchants, that add together 46 SP.

Those "AH prices" are 25g at EU-Venoxis. You can earn 25g within an hour if you really go for it....

One more moron to join the others on the igno-list.
---
Warriors can immune / break the grenade sap, fyi - and reflectors don't do anything to warriors.
---
As far as I'm aware warriors are also the only class that turns pets into a liability because of the quirky way intimidating shout works, on top of taunt.
---
And I mean you can presume warriors are the worst class for solo PvP if you want to, but I have years of experience in vanilla primarily world PvPing and dueling which says they're quite capable. Stances and rarely used abilities in PvP (like the aforementioned pet taunt) give warriors an enormously high skill ceiling which IMO is only rivaled by rogues.
---
Does anyone know if it‚Äôs faster to level an alt on a seperate account using my 60 fury warrior to run it through dungeons than it would be to just solo level it? I would fill the extra spaces up when I could for the extra XP.
---
Judging from experience with an alt it is still very different. On my main most people often wouldn't start a fight unless there was actually something to fight for. Typically stuff got sorted out by itself. There are 2 people from the opposing faction farming stuff? Better don't contest their spawn or you get killed. But if you didn't bother them, they wouldn't bother you. Of course you'd still get attacked sometimes, but you didn't expect it by default.
---
Right now people are leveling their alts and care way less about reaching max level and are much more likely to attack someone. Also consider that you could easily still be leveling when phase 2 hits and there is actually an incentive to gank people. I'd assume leveling a toon above lvl 50 on a pvp server will be a rather unpleasent experience between phase 2 and 3.
---
bought my book for 5 gold on the ah.....
---
What mechanics?
---
Restorative potions are over a gold on most servers and will rise in price. Imagine being forced to spend gold just to have a chance of surviving dots.
---
Submerge for sure. Inconsistent philosophy about whether or not we're using banish and trying to go single target or trying to use aoe is a very common thing and you can waste 4 pulls trying to decide which way your group wants to go. Ranged dps not using the whole circle well enough and then knocking two or three others when they get fireballed. Melee dps not understanding the threat and positioning and in/out mechanic (to be fair I don't understand this either, but it isn't my job so cba to understand it).
---
A lot of pugs try to roll with 35 or so and that works for everything up to rag, but is often excruciatingly slow (and pugs in general just lack urgency the whole way through the dungeon). So then they call a second Domo/Rag night just to finish the ID. But this is suicide for a pug that only has 35 people right now, because you're guaranteed to be down a minimum of say 5 the next night. So now your down ten. And it is very hard even on a high population server to convince 10 people to use their ID that week on a 2-boss pug and what is essentially a progression night on Rag.
---
On top of all that, pugs just straight-up lack determination. They'll do 5 wipes into rag and then they'll start losing people because they'll think they're not capable of killing it.
---
I'm api illiterate. :(
---
The question is if you have edgemasters. If so, the sword, if not the hand.
---
more than what other classes get for one simple mouse click, I'd consider that decent
---
and bash
---
Yes, but then you are casting all the time and in longer fights, you might run out of mana because of it.
---
Seems a lot like retail. Sit at the major city and do nothing xD
---
Blizzard please fix this before P2. Mass world pvp is one of the big draws of classic
---
Sounds like bullshit.
---
Pattern is 50g on mine
---
Wait are you saying you tank as a rogue? How does that work?
---
It's pretty much just rune cloth farming. Expensive, but after 600g-700g roughly you get there
---
Is there an addon or something that tells you whose loot it is?  I thought this was a thing....
---
Dillidan, you son of a bitch!
---
&gt;It sucks wasting your time when you don‚Äôt have much.
---
You guys are a paladin and a warrior. This is the best possible grind you can do, if you have herb+mining and possibly a lowlevel enchanting alt on a second account. Nobody here can give you exact numbers, but it sure as fuck is worth it.
---
No you were not. It's as good for healers as it is for dps and as a pally, it's even better because you can also use it for tanking if you ever have to.
---
Yeah I saw about 5 of these on new when I made the comment.
---
Some DM gear is BiS until AQ. They'll be relevant for a long time.
---
I got The Rake from Mulgore and named him Mimi, because it is an awesome masculine name.
---
About 5 minutes earlier I had tamed Mazzranache (aka Pink Flamingo) and was trying to work up some training points and boom, The Rake is there. A choice was made.
---
Grove Ilya is the most balanced Pvp server in the game. Literally 50/50
---
I was also tremendously disappointed with the writing and stories of Diablo 3 and that came out 7 years ago. I feel the quality of their devs has been on the decline for a lot longer than this community acknowledges.
---
Starting in teldrassil. The sound track gives me chills
---
Yeah, all 3 if either of those two have 2 accounts. Just bring a L5 alt to the instance for disenchants.
---
I've had something similar. I can quite easily kill the elites demon warriors in the south of Winterspring on my druid using roots. However just yesterday I had the same one resist roots multiple times so I was left helpless. Weird.
---
Can you imagine how many people will be coming in with AQ? 
---
That war effort is going to get completed in no time.
---
Idd, if i'm able to play @like 7pm ST it's busy as hell, groups form in minutes, etc but my schedule means i wind up on like 3am ST most of the time and at that point you wind up stood in IF with the 10 other people who are LFG trying to form a group for an hour before you just log an alt.
---
Couldn't even imagine what it's like playing a server that's medium at peak times.
---
Weird.. there was usually a code of honour in my experience, live and let live.
---
And then sometimes.. you have to fight.
---
yes classic features the nerfed versions of dungeons and raids with the good loot tables.
---
Grid2 worked fine on sunday raid for me. Check if you didnt mess up the settinngs, grid is pretty tricky.
---
Also I noticed incoming heals stops working like once mid raid every other week, but a /reload fixes it.
---
Keep em
---
First of all I never said I expected him to teach me anything about the game. I realize that I‚Äôm a long way off from being ready to raid. The reason im saying he‚Äôs an asshole is because of they way he responded to a simple question. He acted as though we demanded that he make a second raid group or that we bitched about not being able to raid. We simply asked if there were plans to make another one and he went off on this tirade about how he has no times to deal with another raid group and saying that we basically fuck off. The things he said were very condescending considering we were just curious if they would. I have a screen shot I could share but I‚Äôm not trying to publicly call this guy out in case he might remember the conversation. He could have just said they probably won‚Äôt do another one since he doesn‚Äôt have the time commitment to organize it.
---
You can ‚Äúguess‚Äù the spec regarding the dots he puts on you mainly, the mana bar and if he‚Äôs often in cat form or not.
---
If you have insect swarm debuff, he is ever resto or feral resto. In that case it‚Äôs almost impossible for you to win. He will have plenty of mana, instant heal + effective hots. So apprit if you‚Äôre lucky with a counterspell on nature (wrath or heals) and burn him down in less than 10 seconds, or try to dry him out of mana... but very difficult with innervate...
---
If he‚Äôs deep feral it‚Äôs a bit different. He will try to fight you in close combat but will hit harder. However, it can be difficult to land a heal for him as hots are not efficient and he doesn‚Äôt have any instant heal. Therefore, try to snare him and damage him to put him around 30%. If possible keep your IB or your blink because he will, at one point try to bash you or move away to heal. When this happens, either reach to CS or IB to CS him and then burst him down.
---
Very difficult fight however, especially for frost mages, as druids are almost never snared.
---
I thought he was talking about his lava dredger collection with weird phrasing lol
---
For PVP? Grenades, rocket helmet, net projector, reflector trinkets, etc etc. It's an absolute must for anyone remotely serious about pvp.
---
For PVE, explosives are still useful. You have no AOE abilities so throwing a dynamite on aoe pack is more damage than sinister strike. Sapper charges are even better. There are even some single target situations when throwing explosives on cooldown is worthwhile, but that's very class dependent.
---
On top of that, you can use gnomish chicken thing that gives a bit of attack speed to party members (at the cost of a trinket slot), and dragonling trinket uses flame buffet that increases fire damage taken by the target, pretty handy in later phases when fire mages become a thing. Though both of these are situational and you don't need it on all raid members.
---
I don't, and haven't really needed it (although that may change come phase 2). My default demon is the felhunter so I can normally notice them pretty well. If a rouge still tries to gank me I'll happily bring out the succ then corpse camp them to oblivion. The only way a rouge can actually win in a fight with me is if they get the jump on me with a demon besides the succ. That said I don't really get jumped by rouges all that often, it's usually only locks and priests that like to start shit
---
So, you managed to kill him :)?
---
Solo means alone, singular!
---
I just wrote a comment higher up regarding Diablo. I agree it would be great to see a WoDiablo game but with the quality of writing of the D2, Vanilla WoW and WC3 games.
---
And sadly I am convinced they don't have this available any more these days. D3 was just plain bad and illogical writing for me, one retcon after another. I was very disappointed.
---
It doesn‚Äôt take mana unless you finish the cast, so if you keep cancelling at like 2.3 seconds of the channel then your spirit regen can continue until you finish your next cast. If no mana is spent after five seconds regen starts up
---
Some items are very profitable to DE. There's an addon that shows the average DE gain.
---
Thanks that‚Äôs a good idea. I‚Äôll have to take a look!
---
on our highpop server both layers look like this
---
People are just sheep honestly, I've easily tanked so many dungeons as a ret, the funny thing is I'm ret too. I don't understand why they underestimate us so much. 
---
Been doing this from stocks all the way up to Ulda successfully and don't plan on stopping.
---
Not only is it really easy to keep aggro (consecration + ret aura with righteous fury does a LOT of damage and generates plenty of threat) I also end up topping the damage meters due to my crazy AoE output combined with seal of command. I don't lose aggro on boss fights at all. 
---
 Judgement is the closest thing I have to a taunt, and usually a quick target switch, auto attack and judge is enough to get aggro back if I'm grouped with one of those people who love to attack the mobs I'm not attacking, it's good enough. 
---
The only real downside is that I have mana instead of an unlimited resource, but with the utility I bring, I think most people don't care. Lay on Hands, Bubble, and being able to dispel/heal myself or others if needed is very very useful.
---
Solo means strictly not full party lol. Found the pedant
---
Hilarious..?
---
Even the default ui shows Inc heals.
---
This! Let every one install DBM and mages stop casting at 3.5 before shield. Warlocks can cast but let them have 2 open eyes if they have to get themselves shadow protection.
---
You should go to zones that have mithril/truesilver and get your levels off of those veins.
---
All hail Lootcifer!
---
Classic is the cheapest way for Blizzard to capitalize on interest in their old game. So for the future expect more of the same. Classic TBC #nochanges!!!
---
I post at r/ClassicWowPlus with the thinking there will be a chance for improvements after they recreate Burning Crusade and do Classi WotLK. Then I think there is a possibility the company will look for something more than a ripoff. Maybe some of the bugs will be out of the system by then and the game will actually be able to handle world pvp.

On my realm, there aren't enough locks, you want at least 4 for MC. I don't know a single reason why you shouldn't take 1 or 2 more. Their dps is okay and gets very good with a shadow and nightfall in the raid
---
I'm not saying you are 15, I'm saying this debate has been going on for 15 years.
---
If it lead by a guild and slots filled with randoms then it goes to the Guild hosting the raid. On Onyxia it is common not to loot everything - leave the trash loot in, remove randoms then loot and skin it.

What is the best auction house addon between auctioneer and auctionator (or another one)?
---
I've been using auctioneer for a while now and am not totally satisfied with it. For some one like me it is really bloated with features I don't need. I do at least two scans per day and still I feel the prices it shows me are not accurate.
---
Locks do struggle compared to mages early on without a way to increase their hit%. But they aren't meme level dps and their utility is required. Once bloodvine is out they have fantastic dps capability.
---
I just waited like 4-5 days for a low pop realm

now that low/med realm looks pretty good
---
10-20g? Hell no I remember in vanilla they were 60-100g because the gold sellers had all the spawns on lock. Almost impossible to afford them unless u no life farmed in a hardcore guild.

auctionnator is really a must if all you do stay simple in the AH. Clearer UI, really fast scanning and just 2 additional tab (sell and buy). You put the item you want to sell in the selling tab and adjust the price as you see your competitor price. If you want to buy, just go to the buy tab, recherche your item and it list it by decreasing buyout price instead of auction price
---
Do you think they'd force a rename on a normal looking name that just happened to be offensive in some language? Talking in general, not about this case in particular.

Unless youre super lucky or on a dead server dont expect to tame him until youve been lvl 60 for a while :P

Bind ‚Äú/tm 8‚Äù to your mouse wheel, start off by telling your DPS to always focus skull, and then lay down the law with Consecration and Retribution Aura.

It‚Äôs really that simple.
---
I bet most guilds do and would. If any of the priests (or even palas) in my guild suggested that I think it would be allowed no problem. 
---
But at least in my guild people (including me) dont want to. Respecing costs money and healing is my preferred role. And then again there is the problem that content is so easy that it doesnt really matter if we go with 10 healers on Ragnaros and just spam some Flash Heals until we win.

when you equip any weapon slot (weapon or shield, both hand) a GCD occurs. The duration of a gcd is 1.5scd and you can do nothing about it, this is how the game works
---
cod is fine
---
unless its for something very valuable
---
Drop your anni behind the bar.
---
Lol. It's called duo not solo. Smh. Played mmo for 17 years and never heard anyone call a duo a solo because it's not a full party
---
It was Enigma for me :( the old "hang on bags are full" scam.
---
You want a picture of SW on my server right now? There's me and a bankalt.
---
Thats it
---
While I agree with what's been said here, you should know (I mean, at least that's the most probable option) this is gonna stay vanilla *forever.* So there is no 'late' here.
---
The chat gave me cancer.
---
So? Even if it was 300 runs you should still be doing it, it‚Äôs BiS until AQ40
---
Well I‚Äôm under the understanding that when you download Gathermate Data which is a separate addon it‚Äôs a database that has all locations pre loaded? But I‚Äôm getting literally nothing.
---
I'm not quite sure about this one but I think there is a option to hide far away player in cities like you only want the game to show you player at less than x yards from you. If this exist it may help you. Not really sure tho and can't verify, i'm at work
---
I use TSM, and it's been pretty good so far.
---
"solo
---
/Ààs…ô äl…ô ä/
---
adjective ¬∑ adverb
---
for or done by one person alone; unaccompanied"
---
The word you're looking for is Duo.
---
Then put in a tip first. I have never been tipped after opening a box.
---
Did you find that once you installed it and opened your map nodes were displayed across the zone? No additional addon or setup?
---
yeah the visual difference between a high pop and medium pop is not there really.
---
A medium pop has one layer full, a high pop has multiple layers full.
---
It's the low pop where the visual difference is.
---
Sweet :)
---
what if im a herb/skin
---
Bringing the Tier 0.5 sets in early already breaks form the no changes ideal in favor of a more polished up version. Bosses with no drops at all at that level don't feel very vanilla either so in the case they were to be brought out early I think the suggestion would minimize the deviation. No new items to mess with the overall loot pools, especially if the individual borrowed pools goes away once the real drops get re-introduced.
---
They‚Äôre actually not tails......
---
Being 5 minutes late to MC is a pretty big deal.
---
Sick PvP weapon, a meh PvE raid weapon if you are using the correct armor debuffs
---
Obsidian Edged Blade actually beats it out in raids if you don't play a human warrior
---
thats really handy, thank you  
---
I always just hit 5 for pickpocket, then 1 for ambush, but that gives me 1 less button pressed per mob
---
\*Looks at raid trinket drop tables.\*
---
Nah, dem is raid gear.
---
No, if you only care about DPS you wouldn't invite Warlocks or Mages at all. BEfore ZG Casters can't really compete with Melee. MElees have so much better Consumables. Mongoose, 2% Crit Sharpeningstones, Firewater and even the Ony-Buff is way better for Melees.
---
Lets see if the BGs will actually run without lag considering the servers are currently pooping themselves when you organize your own 40v40s
---
Basically nothing because this slow pace of releasing things is already starting to bore me to death. I only log on classic to get my Raid IDs done and then logg off.
---
This is why I use innervate when fighting mages haha
---
then hes a muppet. the profit that can be made from crafting that shit atm is stupid. way more then a 350g ninja
---
as a healer, it can be quite horrible trying to heal a dps tank, sure u can do it but u gotta precast heals, and u will probably have to drink alot more, with a prot tank u can just chill which is nice.
---
For healing it doesn't matter.
---
For reference: I started ZF at 38 as holy priest and it was easy, just make sure to stay back and don't aggro mobs.
---
Actually I just remembered I did too! It was 7 years ago and I was fairly active in the guild. Got married and went on honeymoon and didn‚Äôt log in for about 3 weeks and when I came back I‚Äôd been g kicked. It was weird
---
You deserve my upvote for this brilliant piece of writing.
---
PvP premades are not really a thing in P2. Some people will form small skirmish groups, but you don't really need specific class comps for that.
---
Farming kobolds AV gy...I couldn't join fight cause I was on 56k modem at that time so I was in that mine farming gold and runecloth for AV epic wolf mount...I spent hours there. Only times I left mine was if few allies came to our base so I chased them away. So I farmed and monitored BG.  
---
Sounds stupid but it was fun and relaxing for me. Once I got to exalted had enough money for wolf and 2h mace. Was quite happy since that was my 1 epic mount.
---
The fact that you didn't jump down with agro makes up for the mistake
---
They really aren't.
---
Ok might of had rested XP as well. Guess it‚Äôs not worth it then and to just level normally.
---
Is that normal for "good" guilds? I played EVE for a long time, and interviews were real. Both as a conversation between the recruiter and the potential member, and public recruitment forums with questions about experience, characters, participation etc... And vouching people in could have consequences if they fucked up.
---
In Classic I got into my guilds based on knowing guy that vouched me.
---
If it was a feature, could it be made into an addon?
---
Drop them for herbalism and mining. There's your gold.
---
Mongoose in classic ?? /doubt. Maybe you meant Crusader.
---
Liquor Snurf?
---
Yes, that's a good point as well.
---
Normal runs should be way better, at least with a normal or good group.
---
I really wish he did more videos showing his real life.. Fuck I miss Mr. Dunsworth.  Had the chance to meet him once and I blew it.  Damn it.
---
if you are talking about lashers, they can be found in DM
---
Already raid logging.
---
Ah, the very same nice groups that screams of ninjas when someone isn't willing to give up their share of 80 gold(400 gold/5) to a random pug!
---
I've heard stealth tribute runs in DM north are a thing, but don't know any details tho.
---
Big Dirty
---
You just go into the affliction tree as much as you can with only a detour to improved imp if you use it. Also vw tanks suck ass, use either imp or succ.
---
BiS means best in slot.  As in this is the best available item for a particular gear slot.
---
We've just devolved into using it as a term to justify grown adults throwing tantrums on the internet after being forced to share with one another.
---
Skinning is pretty awful at 60. You'll need engineering for blaster charges for solo DM too. What you'll have in addition to engineering is a harder question though. I'd say mining, herbalism, enchanting or alchemy. Probably enchanting.
---
Some dude on my server has the name B√•tarohoror...
---
I don't think rogue have melee cleave spell so I guess no
---
Wonder how many other hunters out there still play with their very first tamed pet because its such a fkng pain in the ass to lvl up a new low lvl one...
---
I decided to grab myself a wolf for raiding, and I even have Deathmaw now but I dont wanna use him because I highly prefer the regular wolf models over the worgs. So I looked for wolves with a decent attack speed of atleast 1.3 and only found exactly 2 I liked in the ashenvales. 
---
Now my raiding pet is lvl 22 and I just say fk that! Cat it is...
---
You just need to have it on your bar to notice it
---
Recently reached level 60 on my priest, I'll share my experience waiting 60 to respec from shadow to holy.
---
- At 50 I was a bit ahead in terms of level (2-3 levels higher than most of my quests). I completed them all from 50 to 60, staying ahead (I was using Questie to make sure I did not miss an easy quest). Being shadow and overlevel means I could complete them fairly quickly : almost no downtime between mobs, I can take 3 mobs easily... I think I took 3-4h each level from Un'Goro to Plaguelands. I could also do the farming quests of Tirion solo quickly, which is pretty nice.
---
- I did ST at 54 to complete quests and get loot. As shadow, it was not easy, I had to drink a lot but using mind blast I triggered spirit tap when I could. Still a smooth run if the group knows to focus on skull and CC other mobs. I did some arena / general runs at 58 as shadow and the general was pretty hard. Good thing I took alchemy and had mana pots to finish the fight without deaths when adds arrive at the end.
---
As a result, I had close to zero BiS at 60, but I rushed the last 10 levels solo questing and could then group more easily to run dungeons (and holy 60 makes it a breeze compared to shadow).
---
I would probably do it again since my server is not in lack of healers so you have competition to find a spot in dungeon groups. I did not have a fixed group of friends or guildies to help either so I would have spent a lot of time looking for groups, and that would have pissed me off.
---
It's up to you to see if it's easy for you to find groups or if you have the motivation to create them. If your goal is to reach 60 as soon as possible, just stay shadow. If you are willing to spend some time looking for dungeons, are not in a rush and want to get some BiS, maybe respec is worth it but not before completing major farming quests (Un'Goro or Tirion for instance), it's really easy xp.
---
Hope it helps.
---
I bet Gehennas
---
no wonder u poor
---
Lol, only if you bad. It's easy as hell to get away from almost any class in any situation and just reset the fight.
---
I like that there's times when nones playing. Makes it easier to do a late-night farm as a student on a weekday!
---
Valuable lesson: Never pass the lead to some random in pug.
---
We can all agree that good players ignore innocent fishermen. Garbage knows no faction.
---
alch can be worth keeping long term
---
at least for the transmute cooldowns
---
You have just created few hundred new scammers xD
---
Best wow is duo wow*
---
This doesnt smell right.
---
Lame af. Wheres the fun in that
---
Does your testing account for Improved Shadowbolt uptime for the rest of the raid though? It's not just increasing your damage after all, but every other Warlock and Shadow Priest. In my raid for example we have 4 locks and a SP, every SB crit only gives me one Imp SB boost to my own SB casts and one Corruption tick worth of damage which isn't much, but it also does the same thing for all the other three locks and all the SPriest's damage for ~3 seconds.
---
It is that simple, playing should be an enjoyable activity.
---
If the group pace isn't fun for you you should look for another group with a faster tank.
---
As someone who is levelling an alt and already plans another... uumm yeah, about that.
---
It's pretty normal for chase items like mageblade to be prioritized to old and trusted members in an established guild. Just as in DKP system you can't expect to win anything on your first run, loot council works similarly.
---
Only super tryhards use Flasks in MC.
---
Using these cross faction communication macros can net you a warning and ultimately a ban though
---
Elixir of the mongoose. 2% crit 25agi

When i first stealthed near the beginning, that was vanish yeah. Later on, it was just regular stealth. You can't stealth when you're in combat, but as a rogue you should know that if you aren't attacked (and don't take any action against an enemy player) for 5.5 seconds, you will leave combat (unless there is a NPC mob on you or something). That gives you an opportunity to stealth again (assuming its not on cooldown).  Conveniently, improved gouge is 5.5 seconds - so you can play around with that and look for opportunities to restealth using it.
---
Flash bomb is created by engineering yup, it works on any beast (not on players, but it will work on hunter pets). There are however engineering grenades which can incapicitate a player. I'm not an engineer though, that flash bomb was just a reward from a quest i had done a bit before the video took place haha. I kind of regret not being an engineer, because it gives you so many cool options like that.
---
My most memorable moment back in the days were the release of the emerald dragons. Specifically my guild going for Taerar, and the PvP surrounding the rest of them.
---
&gt; If he needs it he can buy it on AH. Everyone in the group contributed, everyone deserves a fair chance at it. It's useful to everyone, not just the priest, whether to be used for an alt, given to a friend, or sold on AH.
---
What a fucking cancer mindset.
---
Using your logic, I'll come to your raid and just /roll on every piece of gear you need so I can vendor it because I need the money.
---
It has never worked like that.
---
https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/warlock-dps-pve-spec-builds-talents
---
I thought you could turn in all of them? How did people farm shen'dralar exalted back then unless by turning in thousands of those books?
---
Well, not quite. A drain tank forgoes ruin, and instead will get like the talents that improve drain life's damage, and the spell knockback resist. Drain tank is really just the deep affliction build while sm/ruin is an affliction/destro build.
---
It will spoil!
---
I wouldn‚Äôt recommend constantly casting unless your mana is high, but when the boss enrages or is about to cast a tank buster, that‚Äôs when you want to get the headstart on the cast so it lands just as they take a big spike of damage.
---
It also depends on how well geared/levelled your tank is. If they aren‚Äôt then it‚Äôs a good idea to start your cast when they‚Äôre at about 60-70% health, any lower than 50% is risky and can lead to the situation parodied with the OP.
---
Mc is much easier when you stack warriors and mages because ur killtimes drop significantly. You can straight up ignore mechanics with consumables aswell.
---
Hanging out in the dwarven district with my guildies in Cata. We had so much fun in raids and so much fun just talking &lt;3
---
650 isn't really that much tbh
---
No, there's no way for an addon to know that.
---
Shit this is helpful!
---
hey bro, could you give me a full list of pre-pvp bis gear for a holy paladin if you have the time and are willing. I'm asking for a friend, hes my pockethealer for BG's in the future but he is rather clueless on which items will be good for PvP. My friend and i would be very very grateful, cheers
---
I've got up to just over 200sp on ele with 4.6k mana. Only thing I'll say is int is really important with shaman mana issues and the short fights
---
If we are to be super pedantic, Fadeleaf _is_ sold by some herbalism supplies vendors, bit always in limited quantities. The only reliable source of it is either gathering it yourself with Herbalism or buying from other players.
---
I have added rm -rf / to my Cron. Don't know why my system does not boot up anymore.
---
If nobody is able to skin it from their Guild then it's their problem and I wouldn't give them the scale.
---
what book are you guys talking about? I‚Äôm leveling a paladin right now
---
[Shabby Knot] OwO
---
Alpha build 0.561.412
---
Yeah the only settling I did is disable profession I don't have.
---
I think if you have edgies, you probably want a wep that isn't flurry axe. The strength of flurry axe is mostly as an OH, because its on hit effect causes extra MH hits. Flurry axe is probably ok, but there are better options, including Mirah's Song, Annihilator, Bone Slicing Hatchet, Quel'serrar , or distracting dagger ( which would allow you to not use egemasters)
---
he's going for shadow wrath which is 3% chance on the drakestone drop
---
I think it's better to accept your mistake than trying to blaming someone for pointing it out. I mean, solo is just solo. No other options.
---
Seems that the penalty isn't as high in dungeons. In cases where the 60 can literally pull the entire dungeon, it's better XP than doing the dungeon with equal level players.
---
you are not familiar with timings yet you wanna comment about it? lol
---
Reminds me of EVE online praised "solo" kills, meaning usually multibox with 2-3 alts. Lol
---
I hit 44 before having the 90 required for my mount (warrior, and levelled quite a bit in dungeons, which have a lower gold income). The best farming spot at 40 are the earth elementals in the badlands, but they're heavily camped on my server. Basilisks in desolace give a decent GPH as well, AFAIK. But the best option is just to continue questing. I basically did STV from 40-44 (with a couple of cathedral runs in between) and that got me there.
---
u fkn asshole check ur mail  
---
lmao
---
&gt; I can see that you're not interested in a reasonable discussion,
---
I am.. I am just using your logic in regards to looting so maybe you can see how dumb it is.
---
Couple goals right here!
---
Awesome!!
---
introduce tinker that has the ability to be played completely with turrets
---
I love that class, I played heimerdinger on LoL as a main for years.
---
Turret Defense is one of my fav genre for in between
---
I just love turrets
---
Turrets all the way
---
f\*ck trebuchets or Catapults, its turrets!
---
All warriors pop a greater stoneshield potion. The fury offtanks who tank the "melees" use 1hander and shield while the furys who tank the "casters" dual wield.Use one rogue on each caster for kicks.. We have the whole raid pop a greater shadow prot and fire. Stack them all up and aoe them down.
---
Sure. If everybody is happy the way it is, then everybody wins ;D
---
GL on the loothunt!
---
I am not absolutely sure. It would be a bitch to test right. 
---
But this is how I "know". Before my first raid I just asked a few people what addons for healing they use and some told me no special raid frames, no healcomm and that they see inc heals.
---
Then to test it I turned off grid once mid raid and I did a couple of bosses and I could see incoming heals on the blizz ui (however I could not see my heals which was a bit of a mindfuck).
---
I cannot really confirm that for example I just see other heals from only people who use addons and I miss others. But I know I at least see some (it seems to me most or all?).
---
No armor for raiding. Max fire &amp; shadow resistance for early raids. Some put the last points in stamina while some put them into arcane, mostly for Shazzrah.
---
For AQ you'll want nature and frost for Naxx.
---
Oh interesting can we see the math?
---
Joking of course because I doubt you have it. Just because something buffs people does not mean it's automatically good.
---
Until you provide some convincing math to back it up I'm going to trust my gut and say a 1/6 proc, the other 5 being nearly useless, is not worth the immense dps loss.
---
omfg
---
I did ele from 54-59. Gearing was a little annoying because strict clothies would get pretty pissy when I needed on cloth. Then DM came out and east being 70% immune to me pissed me off enough to go back to enhance. But at that point I did have green dragon mail armor that let me have 15% mana recovery to continue during casting. It helped a little but had no SP on it, or int IIRC, and forced me to use a higher rank spell mostly negating its effect. (Also lack of the good water at the time sucked.)
---
I haven't added up how much SP my set in the bank has but fairly certain it is now enough to down rank more to help the mana issues some. Though I know I'll still have them. Might give it another go shortly once I get rid of the last couple junky items I have for it.
---
Haven't seen one in a week or so actually, and I'm on a server that's still layered
---
I think what would make sense, was if the races only required Revered with their respective faction, and Exalted would be for their racial mount.
---
Zul'Gurub is also Phase 4 not Phase 2.
---
yeah I know what you mean. I had a list of quests still to do in my log when I hit 60 on my main. The battle of darrowshire and the crimson courier were some. I'd still like to complete them at some point.  
---
Got my alt to level 30 already, so aim to spend more time questing and less time rushing it this time.
---
oh the people on firemaw are fucked up as well. i assure you even if that guy did that 10 times, (almost) nobody on firemaw would care.
---
That's rough man.
---
Race doesn‚Äôt matter much. A good priest is a good priest.
---
At the rate and speed that people are killing bosses I don‚Äôt even see a need for specific race priests. People who say you must be a specific race are trying way too hard.
---
Play whatever race you like for whatever reason. I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs how gear sets look on them, or maybe casting/attacking animation or WHATEVER. Just have fun.
---
Orgrimmar was the same =)
---
Will do when I get home

The most common leveling build is drain tank. Google it and a couple guides should pop up. It will give you the sustain and damage to farm forever
---
Spell Batching is a huge deal, so I don't get why you'd bring it up here.
---
You make fun of him, but here you are, taking photos of a computerscreen, when your keyboard has an actual "Print screen" button.
---
I usually don't talk about her, because she's the one tanking for the sorry ass dps, and I'm the one healing my girlfriend.
---
Seriously, with all the stupid DPS players that are too common, dungeon runs feel like a daycare. It actually made us talk about whether we really want multiple children. Or just one, or none...
---
u dont
---
Hopefully you learned not to overplay your position now. Once you pass lead to a randy prepare for chaos
---
Broken Tooth cant hold agro for shit.  I got him, and now have to level him to 40 to get bite so maybe he can hold aggro.  The wolf I got in Feralas is just...better.  (side note, my broken tooth is named Mollymauk, and my wolf is Caduceus.   My first cat is Vexahlia.  Sense a trend?)
---
Its like night and day those 2 experiences haha
---
I mean the grind rep is just doing World Quests, which is something you are supposed to do every day anyway. So it's not so much of a grind as simply timegating.
---
&gt;and you could do them at 42.
---
Unless you're a tank, in which case 44 is the minimum IMHO, due to the later packs where you get wiped if they resist a single taunt.
---
Because they hoard top end daggers for PVP later on. They play combat sword for PVE now.
---
Clearing ur disinformation
---
Meanwhile my guild is kicking people who aren't logging purple numbers because they want to clear mc faster than an hour.
---
Yeah I started ZF at 40 but felt like I was a burden because I would body aggro mobs from a stupid distance. Felt bad, but I guess that comes with slightly under leveled instance running.
---
So if a freezing band drops you should pass and let the mage take it because it's an upgrade for them? That's a lot of gold bro, boes should always be free rolls.
---
Blizzards crappy servers can't handle massive pvp
---
A lot of people are making excuses for blizzard on this and saying it's only the max populated servers. Good luck in phase 2 when you want to kill world bosses. Even the lower populated server will have at least 2-3 guild that want to kill them, which currently the servers can not handle.
---
Just level your mage to 29-30 by questing it should take around 1d playtime. Then just do spellcleaving in SM gy, library, armory, cath until 43. Then you switch to ZF to around 51-52 and then you do BRD to 59 and lastly just do LBRS, Scholo, strat to 60. That should take around 6-7d game played.
---
I won‚Äôt get one for a couple days then in the span of a few hours I‚Äôll get a few of them.
---
There are people who need and people who are naive. 
---
Using the greed/need system like it was meant to is a nice idea, but in reality it does not work with randoms.
---
So basically he makes you to look behind all the time :)
---
It's 90g for mount and 10g for training ... without discount.  
---
If you are Honored with your faction (and you should be around level 40) it become: 81g for mount and 9g for training.
---
"Classic wouldn't be popular, we don't need good servers"
---
This is the thought process that leads to this.
---
&gt;...so what else is there for me to do at the moment? 
---
There is SO much to do!  
---
So yeah, since this is Classic outside of the end-game raid(s) you wont have other forms of time-sinks like Pet Battles, Garrison Upkeep, Daily Quest grinds, and in-game event quests for just about every holiday you can think of... but that's okay!   
---
You can still coordinate mass lv 1 pink haired gnome (or naked tauren) raids to run across Azeroth--or maybe faction raids against opposing faction cities. You can coordinate PVP tournaments (which included both factions) at the arena in STV or smaller fight-club style mixed-faction dueling near Menathil Harbor. Heck, there was even a time in vanilla when some players ran a casino in Ironforge. If you're more of a solo player, you could even explore with wall jumping (since wall walking was fixed and is not in classic :(  ) and check out places like Hyjal, the Troll village, or Caverns of Time.  
---
If you feel like you need to be always productive and these other activities don't offer that, you could always start grinding out the materials you will need for the scepter in opening the gates for AQ (so you can get that sweet black quiraji battle-tank mount!).
---
Getting my Dreadsteed mount on my Undead Warlock back in Vanilla! The sheer amount of work involved; having to collect all the materials, doing the long quest chain and then finally summoning the beast in Dire Maul.
---
To add to what everyone else is saying, we're one of the few classes that can get away with using 1 spec for PVP, PVE &amp; farming, and the spec is good at all 3 (though not the best, naturally).
---
I'm talking of course about [SM/Ruin](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/3500200512201135--50500051220001). You can switch some points around in Affliction according to your preference.
---
With 16 debuff slots, you're often allowed to use Corruption, which means the DPS difference with DS/Ruin is very small and, after all is said and done, in MC &amp; BWL the top dps warlock won't come down to spec, but to luck, since we have low to non-existent hit.
---
The point is he needed for "someone else". That "someone else" being his "supposed" wife.
---
I get maybe one a day.
---
I guess it depends on how they collect names. How many chat channels you are part of, if you are in a guild, if your name appears early in alphabetical lists, etc. You can extract the names of everyone who is part of /world chat or /general etc, and then use those names to invite you to spam channels.
---
Neither did it really agree on much anything. You'll end up alienating one crowd or another. Not much to discuss if you make the decision based on numbers alone.
---
Holy fuck this shit made me laugh so hard.
---
Thank you. It's getting very annoying
---
ICC 2.0 please
---
An extra DPS makes the fight faster. Especially if you're horde, where you get a shaman that's decent as DPS as well (and can heal in a pinch) it would make sense to take another enh. shaman over another healer if the healers have too much of an easy time.
---
Well, i havent seen any rogues anywhere who are no lifing it hard enough to already have a Perdition‚Äôs Blade in the bank while farming epic swords in the meanwhilr. 
---
Also what kind of fucked up guild would allow a rogue to roll on both this early on in the game while basically all melees are fighting over these weapons. 
---
Lol. Your comment is really tilting me.
---
Because majority of encounters lasts less than a one minute.  
---
Even Ragnaros fight take minute and the half.  
---
They simply don't need more DPS :) And healers can't go OOM during this time, this is why they could spam anything they want.
---
Interesting perspective and I sort of agree with you but this is more of a secret trade offer because most people are going to use the loot it's just that one guy likely intended to buy loot off whoever wins it. If this was an advertised GDKP run or something similar I think I'd be fully on board with what you say but I'm guessing this raids primary purpose was for people to use any items they win so making every item a Free roll for money would sort of screw over 90% of the raiders in there who probably neither intended to buy nor sell the loot.
---
Yeah. I didn't like it so much yesterday when "oom" the palret won the need roll on [brigam girdle](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13142/brigam-girdle)
---
in our guild run to UBRS, as a war tank myself who was also asked not to tank in favor of 2 druids, despite me being the only war in the guild, AND wanting to tank really bad
---
&gt; Seriously. Say warden staff sells for 500g. It drops and the druid wants it. You say he should have it by default if he needs it. But of he needs it why hasn't he bought it yet? Cause he doesnt have the gold? So really he needs the gold. Not the piece.
---
No, he needs the gold to buy the piece, hence, he literally needs the piece. How you can even think of arguing that the person doesn't need the piece is beyond me. Why would he need the gold if he doesn't need the piece? The logic doesn't hold up, sorry. 
---
&gt; Well everyone need gold. Maybe the rogue needs the gold for his edgemasters. Does the druid get to take that amount of gold from everyone just because hes a druid?
---
If the druid would be alright with passing the Edgemasters, then yes. Personally I wouldn't mind passing on a BoE if I had some way of guaranteeing the person would actually use it, and not just sell it off for profit. In **that** case they needed gold, not the piece, one might say. 
---
&gt; Because if he needs it that badly, he should have bought it
---
Tell that to the healing-specced players that farm gold much, much slower than other classes. I'm sure you would be very popular amongst every healer out there :)
---
Food buffs though!
---
Pretty high demand for summons/banishes and debuffs/buffs.
---
That time I won BlizzCon tickets on reddit truly stands out as once in a lifetime moment. I was ecstatic and excited to see and hear of the future of classic.
---
Im 50/50 about transmog. On one hand It's cool to be able to see people in their actual gear, but then when every lvl 40+ is running in the same SM gear, and after a while every lvl 60 wears the same BiS gear (where literally no piece matches eachother aesthetically) yeah i'm not so sure anymore.
---
I think the solution would be to have an option to display cosmetic gear or not.
---
What about his trash
---
Wat? Restorative pots and also should only need 1 or 2 dispels per mage
---
My MH is a Deathbringer I was thinking flurry axe would be an excellent as an OH.
---
Good devils advocate. The op could be telling a lie. But as a MT of a top 30 guild, I was in the decisions to take what tank to what raid. I‚Äôm assuming this guild is only doing one 40 man team. Having 9 tanks is GREAT. Only a couple of them spec tank and rest dps. Have those other 9 guys to tank trash and rotate it around is a good way to train tanks for naxx ( 4hm)  and etc. this lets your guild be flexiable with raid times. But if this guild can‚Äôt support more than 1 raiding team, using ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt have draconian deflector so therefore you can‚Äôt tank for us.‚Äù Doesn‚Äôt make any sense if they were in a guild that considered this. I‚Äôd simply find another guild that wants a dps war that wants to eventually tank.
---
It honestly sounds like this guild is making up some dumb excuse because their leadership cant come to a decision based if the player follows under this type of thing.
---
Fucking hell, if you had like 5 people you could do mc pugs with a different team I lnorder to let your tanks get experience and get gear at the same time.
---
if you do lvl eng, do it the right way, get 300 on gnomish and get all trinkets and teleporter, then do it all over again for goblin. too expensive? get mining and dont waster gold, waste time. Thats what I did, don't think about it and just do it, by the time you have everything an eng can have, you will feel good with yourself.
---
Which vendors? Honestly asking, because I have never seen it and Wowhead provides no results of it being sold by anyone.
---
8 mcs and oyr guild has had a total of 2 weapons drop, 1brut and 1 mageblade.
---
Affliction (sm/ruin) - Very Good Balanced grinding, pvp, lvling and pve spec
---
Affliction (sm/ds) - Very strong grinding, pvp  spec
---
Demonology (master demon/ruin) - Mediocre grinding, pvp and pve spec
---
Demonology (soul link/nightfall) - The Best grinding, lvling and pvp spec
---
Destruction (conflagrate/nightfall) - A glass-cannon non-raid pvp spec.
---
Use a hunter to pull so you don't accidentally lose a tank on the pull.  The hardest part of Domo is having all the adds properly picked up at the beginning, once everyone is in place it's very easy to kill the adds one by one.
---
The talk about warrior leveling difficulty are grossly exaggerated here.
---
I am lvl47 warrior and leveling wasnt difficult at all, and Im relatively new to wow (started in MoP). Altough ive had my friends help me with elites etc.
---
Sure its a bit more challenging but if you keep your first aid and food up to date youre not gonna have trouble.
---
If they had nobody available to skin Ony or the corehounds in MC, then they shouldnt be asking you to hand over the leather  /scales.  Had you not been on the raid, nothing would have been skinned. 
---
What you could do, is split the leather / scales, so they get some and so do you. Then you'll be invited back if they pug again. However its purely down to your generosity.
---
True. There are still a fair amount of Alliance even though the server is almost 70/30 split last time I checked. Just tonight I had two separate raids of Alliance zone into MC and wipe me and my guys that were summoning. They still have a presence.
---
Thank you so much!
---
What, doesn't the priest book literally costs several hundred gold on some servers? At least that's what people have been stating on here as of late.
---
Ahh just noticed your flair lol.
---
I was thinking of trying it, but at level 6 my DPS from casting was so awful that I'm considering leveling to 12 or so and then just staying in dungeons all the time and level as resto.
---
Once you learn how to write queries, there is nothing more powerful than aux IMHO.

---
We'll be kicking this dead horse until they give us what we really want, not what we think we do!!!
---
&gt; You should at least have it to get rid of those annoying diseases you get from random mobs
---
Absolutely. When I quested in EPL i pretty much used it the very moment its CD ended
---
Yes yes you're such a hero.
---
My fondest memory of this game, was probably the day I got Spinal Reaper from Ragnaros.
---
Id been watching pvp videos religiously, and this guy called Grievous had this compilation of him oneshotting people with Spinal Reaper(and reck bombs, probably more the reck bombs)... and i decided that I wanted that axe no matter what!
---
I specifically remember dreaming of getting it, thinking about nothing else, and then that faithful night happened..
---
We down Ragnaros, and the ML links the loot and talks about it on voice coms.. he links some items and the axe is not there.. bummer, maybe next time!
---
He deals out the loot, and people start hearthstoning out. I'm about to use mine when I realize the whole officer team is still standing around the body, as half the raid leaves, the ML announces that there are a couple of more items to be bid on.
---
Bonereavers Edge.. and Spinal Reaper!
---
BRE is ofc every melee's wet dream.. but my  eyes was glued to that axe!
---
BRE gets dealt with first, and ends up going to the MT with his almost endless dkp pool. 
---
They then move on to the axe.. the second the bids start I smack down all my dkp.. I actually remember how much! 240dkp!
---
The longest minute of my life follows.. and suddenly, it's in my bags.
---
I didn't become a pvp god because of it, but I believe that I was! Probably the single greatest moment vanilla, and gaming in general!
---
Not entirely true when fights are so short, that only works when fights are like a static 3 minutes. You can't get spell hit cap until zg so if you go for pure hit over crit you will do less damage than a mage who prioritized properly vs both hit and crit.
---
What's the matter?!
---
Except when it doesn't. Try blacklisting any tank these days, you will get laughed at and rightfully so, nobody cares about blacklists, it's just some revenge fantasy people here like to pretend exists.
---
Keybind your spells!
---
You need to import the downloaded data.
---
I'm soloing jump runs on my warlock with mining. Gold is minimum 60g/h but almost always higher, depends on the mats that drop.
---
thats hella deep brah
---
What would you go? Thanks for the insight by the way!
---
I don't even know if Stallone ever had arms that big
---
You mean f**, as in annoying harley riders?
---
Pets are very valued in our raid team, their selfless sacrifices at the Garr and Domo pull shall never be forgotten.
---
Honestly the best bet is know what kind of stat weight you want and make your own list. For locks you basically take pve stat weight and swap spell hit for stamina, I assume it's something similar for other classes.
---
As the prime skinner for my guild Core Hound leather I would say is to who ever of the pugs gets them first unless the host guild asks for them or some of them if you got to them first.
---
Now your ony situation is a bit different. If the host guild did not bring one or come to you asking for you to skin her then that is on them. Its their fault for not being prepared for her. And getting that dang dagger is not easy. Took me so many runs of UBRS to get it. Think that guild should have given you a scale at least for doing that for them. Its the least they COULD do or flat out pay you for doing so. If not she would have just rot there.
---
Well yeah most people are working or at school haha
---
the thing is, your an enchanter, so run ZF, and DE the loot. You can easily clear ZF or SM easily and quickly. Have clear bags, and vendor the trash, and sell the cloth and DE all other loot. 
---
The other option, is to farm for twink items. Run SFK several times. You can prob clear it in 15-20 mins, so can easily run it 3-4 times in an hour.  If you get a few of the BOE twink items, then they sell for lots of gold.
---
All of that is true, but honestly it just doesnt matter. I am to be frank in something I would consider a pretty bad guild despite all the people being very nice. There are a lot of people who just do dungeons, have no idea what they need or what they bis are, raid leaders need to tell them what to roll on and what is good on, like a decent chunk of the guild cant speak english, they use zero addons except dbm and so on. I honestly am slacking too. I didnt enchant any of my gear yet and its all preraid bis or better that I will use for some time.
---
And yet it took us 1h45min from Lucifron start to Rag death. It is so easy there is no reason to bother.
---
This is funny. I just shove my lockbox into rogues inventory until one of them opens it. I never tip because there's hundreds of rogues everyday just sitting in IF doing nothing.
---
In my opinion that's taking it way too far. I too would be pissed if people needed on an profession pattern that I needed, *for their alt*. Of course they have the right to roll, just like I have the right to think they are an arsehole for doing so.
---
Call me out of line, but this shit looks crazy bootleg for some reason
---
Also you're orc so axes gives you a big advantage
---
As I understand it, we have better threat gen tools, but warriors have an easier time with mitigation, and with the gear progression warriors will be better in the middle phases, but we'll catch up in the late phases again.
---
go away. Offering nothing to the discussion, making fake claims with no back up, etc etc
---
That's kinda the point, each class has their own quirks that add to the feel that it's an rpg. Hunter and lock have no bag space, and have to deal with bullshit pet management. Shaman have to actually collect the totems before they can use them. Mages have to deal with being the group's vending machine. Warriors have to die if they pull 2 mobs. It all adds flavor having to deal with the bs.
---
I‚Äôve done that, in game settings opening up Gathermate. 
---
Going to the import tab and selecting import pressing the button and boom still nothing on my maps :(
---
Blizztard: What do you mean? fix what?
---
My bank contains soulbound stuff, and 1-2 raid's worth of consumables.  Everything non-soulbound sits on a bank alt.  I have 7 bank alts.
---
Ok.
---
Thank you for this. I am leveling in affliction at the moment, and will go to get improved voidwalker, then switch back to affliction. I have heard good things about drain tanking at 42+ ..
---
I did not idk on my server all got perds already its like 20% droprate, just go get it
---
To be honest sounds like a fake story. Also who doesn't know what BIS means, this really makes me think you're faking it. Also why would you post this to reddit? At best I imagine you ask your guild.
---
True xD
---
&gt; you ruin your reputation
---
After this run is over, nobody except op will care. You can spam trade a bit, but it will be drowned out and forgotten in few minutes. Reputation ruined lol. As if.
---
Marking them on your minimap (the ones within your detection range) is not the only thing it does, it also raises your detection level by about 30 points. Basically you detect lvl 60 rogues as if they were 54, which is pretty huge.
---
It's the equivalent of a rogue sapping you repeatedly. What are you gonna do? Just take it like a pussy?
---
Carry some invisibility potions to prevent camping :)
---
Plenty of pissed off hordes(mainly the ones who I've killed beforehand) tried to camp my corpse to no avail, since I could always escape with the help of the invisiblity potions, then kick their ass once i'm fully buffed/healed.
---
Best advice would be to get into a guild. Loads are recruiting and then get a majority guild run. Less drama and lots of people willing to help.
---
You are mostly correct but green quests starts giving reduced exp when you are 6 levels above the quest!
---
Yo don't spoil my afk youtube MC strats pretty please!
---
Dal‚ÄôRend set &gt; Perdition + Core Hound Thooth dps-wise. I‚Äôve watched many streamers get dagger loot and noone rolls initially for them. Also there are guilds with 6-7-8 Rag kills already. Also try hard warriors aim for axes. If you have like 3 rogues in the raid they could be pretty lucky as I was.
---
Pretty sure that Aimed Shot wouldn't have worked anyway, you were in his deadzone.
---
This sub is pure comedy
---
Yeah you‚Äôre making a really good point!
---
Congratulations, that‚Äôs not the case here, haven‚Äôt seen in once on my server on anyon. Just go get it? Well I will have to wait for next weeks MC and hope that the 4 other dagger rogues don‚Äôt take it.

While we're at it let's make dog damage not count towards parses on golemagg. Tired of getting yelled at because I'm full dotting the dogs trying to get those golds lul.
---
Dude seriously? Single vanish a d u aren't hunter but a prey.
---
Warlocks want the same.
---
I always just downvote these posts no matter what. I simply can't get over using a phone to take a picture of a monitor, when there's built in picture-taking buttons AND the snipping tool. Baffling.
---
That's a first
---
What's that purple forcefield kind of thing in the background ?
---
You must not be american I guess, pointing guns at each other is their way of feeling safe and protected.
---
Locks can safelly pass on it too. It's a nice but short-lived upgrade. As a lock you want the eye of the beast - which is a quest reward, and a reed which can be substituted by DM trinket
---
The hilarious thing about dk tanking being viable in all specs was that it was only due to how extremely overpowered they were for 5 mans and solo.
---
Urgh, this min/max bs. For me daggers are much more fun, and I‚Äôm using Barmans shanker and none of the dal rend rogues with crusader does higher dmg than me.
---
Private servers were way better at this jfc...
---
Either way it's pathethic on the part of blizzard to fail to deliver playable large scale pvp when hobbyists can do it. Doesn't really matter if it's because they're using the wrong kind of infrastructure or because they optimized their client badly for the purpose.
---
Yeah, and the other day there was apparently a big ol' WPvP skirmish over in Southshore and then a bit later over at the Garrison (near WPL, I think?). Like, I've definitely seen worse times in the life of the game on some realms, but I feel like the next few months are going to really suck (back-to-back holidays so people going home to spend time with family instead of logging).
---
Ok thanks for the correction: then you have enough time to rest in between the runs, 5 runs per hour is more efficient than open world anyway.
---
Wait what, they are sold by the engi vendor in og
---
loooooooove it man, love it
---
Why would they want to fight it if people pay them anyway?
---
Ive seen multiple post about people hitting insane gold/hr in DM cus living essence is 4-5g and Ghost mushroom is about 2. On Firemaw neither is over 80 silver.
---
When dailies became obligatory they just felt like lazy quest design.
---
It is 10g on Mograine eu pvp alliance atm.
---
Its not crazy rare but its crazy valuable
---
One place that is overlooked for farming is Andorhal. The mobs are high enough level to drop end game loot and there are an abundance of mobs to farm, so you never really have any down time. Your main gold comes from greens, greys runecloth and the silver they drop. But your earning potential is really only limited by the speed in which you can kill the mobs due to the density. Your never going to earn megabucks in this location, but it can be lucrative with some luck.
---
its always amazing how tanks have the most inflated and fragile ego at the same time....
---
The poor sods who decided to use the free transfer and are on actual dead realms.
---
Leave your guild now and find a more active guild. Get to 60 50-60 is the longest part so you have plenty of time to make more friends! :)
---
You will get it dont worry, if you only got 4 rogues in your raid, your chances is massive to get it, 100% just keep going
---
Bud it's 3am. No one is on at that time
---
I don't think they can really get me back without alienating the current fanbase.
---
They'd have to remove all the blatant immersion-shattering stuff; phasing, world quests, "currencies" (e.g. artifact power), big mounts, transmogs, flying...
---
He literally listed everything that each build is good at, and you mf is still too lazy to pick your own goddamn build! PICK the build thats good at what you want to do! Its not that hard! 
---
Seriously guys like you make my blood boil.
---
Yeah, just without the edgy enlightened centrism of South Park, and instead with all the bigotry and hatred that keeps popping up at all corners of the internet the last few years. Also with three extra letters. Not just F\*\*.
---
Once I hit 60, provided I have enough time/resources, I'm determined to attempt a Melee Warlock build/gear-set. I figure I can use swords/daggers, I have an ability that buffs my melee attacks with said weapons (firestone), and I even have a talent that buffs that ability (imp firestone). So OF COURSE I've got to play around with that, right?
---
Question about weapon skill. So, if you have a racial that gives you more. Axe +5 for instance. And as I understand weapon skill increases hit and crit chance. But does this also apply when hitting higher levelled mobs. So if I‚Äôm 20 warrior with +5 axe. Can I hit a 21 levelled mob equally well as a level 21 warrior who does not have the +5 axe racial? So we actually have the same axe skill level even though I‚Äôm 20 and he is 21.
---
you kinda dont have a choice. It's either ice block or arcane power. Take 5/5 chill or don't take at all either
---
fire can be okay for dungeon running, but you will come across a fair share of fire immune and fire resistant encounters past level 52, I don't recommend it.
---
Gear and talents are massively buffed. Thats why MC is basically a cakewalk now.
---
Loot foreskins
---
Wtf! How could a Swedish person do this.. The guy who tried to scam,if you translate his name from Swedish to English, you get "gay bank"
---
I haven't played a high level druid in years, but I thought this wasn't true. Warriors get sunder armor, defensive stance (which increases threat gen), revenge, whirlwind (not strictly great threat generation necessarily, but deals AoE damage like a bear's swipe), cleave and heroic strike (for when you've got tons of rage. It deals a high amount of threat). Protection warriors also get shield slam (which deals a high amount of threat and only has a 6 second cooldown).
---
I thought bears had a smaller toolkit?
---
Again though, I haven't played a high level druid in years, and even when I did, I wasn't raiding, so my knowledge is definitely lacking.
---
I like how you instantly casted slowfall without panicking. (:
---
Can someone explain why?
---
I''d go there in a heartbeat if you could transfer there from Lucifron.
---
How do I undelete my character in classic lol?
---
Hey guys, 
---
My main is set, I have a lv60 gnome warlock that I love to play in PvE. I have a great guild and raid every week. For some reason, I'm not a big fan of it in PvP. I'm not the best PvP player and I feel like I'm constantly eating everything in the face. 
---
With an eye on world PvP and BGs, I am on the fence between 2 classes: paladin and hunter. Goal is to get to 60 before phase 3 (AV). A couple of questions:
---
1) I'm looking for a class that has those 'ah nice' moments. Big crits that settle a fight without needing too much skill. Sounds silly, but I feel like not getting those every so often would put me off playing the class this is eg why I scrapped druids from the list. 
---
Which class would have more of those (are retri "one/few shots" without reckoning rare?)
---
2) I'm looking for something that doesn't require a lot of gear to get the 'ah nice' moments described above. I'd play the paladin as retri but could tank/heal to get *some* gear at least. Hunter has peak performance in T1/T2 and rok'dhelar which I presume will be pretty easy to pick up in pug MC/Ony runs by p3.
---
However, how do both fare in a mix of quest items and preraid blues?
---
Alternatively, how do both fare when the hunter has Rhok and a mix of blues/T1 and the paladin has The Unstoppable Force and a mix of Lightforge/Valor with some less contested MC epics and perhaps a piece or 2 of T2? 
---
3) I still get nightmares from UD rogues jumping on my little gnome warlock with their WoTF so I definitely want to be able to defeat rogues with more ease. I think both of these classes have it easier against rogues at least but paladin probably trumps hunter here, or am I wrong?
---
4) which of the 2 could be a bigger asset in grouped pvp?
---
My hunter is currently 25 and my paladin 16 but I rrally have no idea atm :(
---
Any input would be appreciated!
---
Not even remotely equivalant. A hunters Mark doesn't stop you from playing or moving. A sap does.
---
And luckily he's horde so he will proc windfury totem and at least have some dps
---
Source?
---
How is regeneration for aoe farming. Less downtime?
---
Cool! I love the developer/designer interviews that you do Josh! Keep it up!
---
Is it wrong to be gay?
---
If he had the name "Straightbank", would that be more okay?
---
The past tense for Yeet is Yote.
---
That's the case for most classes against most classes though. If you get the chance to initiate at your own pace you'll *generally* win. 
---
Obviously not the case with some class matchups but I'd say in the majority of cases if you're getting the drop on someone you've got a major advantage from the start.
---
yes
---
Bruh I love your videos, would watch these till the end of classic :P
---
What do I do at lvl 34 in alliance? I've done a few quests in STV but I am too low level to really complete the next quests and I cannot get anyone to run gnomer.
---
&gt; ~~Maybe~~ they just need to get 5/5 tactical mastery.
---
as a lvl 50, I'd start tanking. Get Mara runs going. Then when u get to level 52-53, get runs into BRD, do it over and over and you'll get some good gear if you have lucky drops. Then on to LBRS and the Ony attunement quests. 
---
As a tank you'll find groups easily so can get to 60 doing instances for loot, if you have the time. 
---
There are some great quest rewards too, so have a look at what you need to upgrade and make a list.
---
Could be a handgun, but I'm laughing imagining pickpocketing a long rifle or something
---
Haha, good luck with that! XD
---
Doesn't Warlock have some instant cast spells? Guess you can weave them in between your autoattacks!
---
Rogue BiS list - [https://shadowpanther.net](https://shadowpanther.net)
---
Alternatively, use [https://sixtyupgrades.com](https://sixtyupgrades.com) and create custom EP presets based around the key attributes you want (ie spriest = stam &gt; shadowdmg &gt; healing &gt; everything else).
---
You wait! If they release tbc that innervate is mine!
---
Our Server is overfarmed since they reduced it to 2 Layers. I really have no idea how they can ever go down to a single Layer on most big Servers. That will just not work! On our Server we have like 30 Guilds who clear MC, back in Vanilla we maybe had 10 at best on our Server.
---
1. Action Bars. I'm an old man so I use Bartender
---
2. Unit Frames. I love the look of Luna but Xpearl is one I'm familiar with and easier to Download 
---
3. Threat meter. I reccomend Recount with the Tiny threat addon for a Dps/threat meter in 1 nice looking package
---
4. Leatrix+ combines a bunch of features. Class name color, auto dismount, and like 15 others
---
5. Item Rack. More important for hybrids and tanks. If rogues dont switch gear a ton a simple trinket menu will suffice
---
6. Atlas: dungeon maps, quest and loot tracker, may also be my world map add on but I cant recall
---
7. Aux and TSM. I dont use the tsm client. Its complicated and I dont feel like it. That said the AH scanner to get market prices is nice. Aux is the most user friendly auction addon 
---
8. WIM. Let's you keep your whispers in IM style windows
---
9. Threat plate.  Nice visual change that also helps you keep track of threat more intuitively 
---
10. Blue Shaman. Shamans arent pink
---
11. Bag addon. Combines your bags if you want, gives a sort and search function
---
imp. voidwolker won't help you much. I guess you'll find out when voidwalker can't hold aggro. You're on the right track with drain tanking where you play with a succ.
---
Your lighting is amazing, this deserves much more recognition!
---
Thank you man, got a new video out today on my youtube :) YouTube.com/snackybox
---
maybe remove your arm out of your ass. You might be faster.
---
It took me about 10 seconds to realize you guys weren't having a giant dance party.
---
There should be an option in the Target settings of Quartz in the Interface options. Same as for every other option.
---
But why wouldn't you use this one over ClassicCastBars? As far as I know, ClassicCastBars doesn't show you when an enemy cast is NOT interruptable. Quartz does indeed tell you with the shield around the castbar spell icon. I have been waiting for Quartz to support enemy castbars since the start of Classic and removed by ClassicCastBars addon immediately.
---
Shamans &gt; Druids &gt;= Warlocks in that order
---
What races/gender and professions did you pick for each ?
---
nah, we just ignore each other.
---
Agreed. As a lock, I won a roll for Star of Mystaria, and the mage was upset because on wowhead it is listed as "best" for mages, while on the lock guide it is listed as "spell hit option". Some people take these guides too literally and stop thinking for themselves.
---
Something about going straight glass cannon is appealing lmao
---
Yeah thanks for your opinion. Just got in WoW. So I‚Äôm just curious on what everyone thinks on this and what is the meta etc.
---
fully agree on this.
---
7th run to ubrs. Haven't seen that shield dropped
---
Thanks for the effort, I appreciate it. The problem is I have already done most of those things and it really isn‚Äôt as fun the second time around. Getting to old IF is cool and all the first time but what‚Äôs there to take you back? 
---
People aren‚Äôt bothered with pvp at the moment as there‚Äôs no reward. I raided the zeppelins with a group of 40 people on the weekend and it died down in an hour because people just didn‚Äôt seem to really care.
---
I‚Äôve probably put more time into the game than 95% of people but I‚Äôm not alone in starting to just log on for raids.
---
Just a visual bug, it doesn't actually increase wand damage.
---
Just like most of the classes in PvE tbh.
---
Well, thing about how it was since the announcement :
---
1.Classic will fail (repeated every day, from Nov. 2017 until couple months before release)
---
2.Classic will fail at launch / will die in a week (mainly between character name reservation - launch)
---
3.Classic launch will be ok, but the game will die in 2 weeks (after Blizzard added more realms)
---
4.Classic launch will probably be big, but the game will die in 2 weeks (2 days before release, after Blizzard added even more servers)
---
5.Sure, Classic launch was massive, but nostalgia will wear off in a month, and the game will die (after launch)
---
6. In 2 months, Classic will lose a massive number of players (every single day since launch)
---
And here we are today, with sad retail drones (still not understanding WHY Classic is dwarfing Retail, both in player numbers and player activity, months later after release), pushing their "Classic is dead" deadline to 3 months.
---
Soon they will push it to 6 months, and when it will obviously NOT happen, they will say go to 1 year...and so on until Naxx.
---
Basically, you and people like you, are salty because what you believed to happen (Classic dead at launch, Classic will be a niche, Classic will die in 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, etc. etc.) it didn't happened at all.
---
Instead of realizing and accepting that Classic is like 3-4 times more popular than Retail, today (it was like 6 times bigger at launch) and it is over, we won the propaganda war, you people are still in denying phase.
---
But, at least, there aren't many of you left. Just some, here and there. Most already accepted the truth.
---
E sold? Keel heem
---
Also isn't it based on healing amount even if it was not overheal?
---
 Rank 1 healing for 200 or whatever wouldn't do much for threat vs pretty much any other ability. Sounds good but it's not worth it at all.
---
Probably took soooo much longer from all those misses.
---
Lol I sold the Hunter book for 800g on day three
---
it really does get a bit tedious from 50-60 as you "think" you're nearly there, but XP wise its still miles away. The half way point XP wise in leveling, is like level 46-47 (i think). So still a lot to do. 
---
At level 51, have you done the Hinterlands quests yet? There are a lot of quests there and lots of groups doing the elite quests too, which give great xp. 
---
Also, at level 51, you can start searing Gorge, un'Goro, which all have loads of quests too.  
---
Also, start looking at your BiS requirements and where to get it. You'll soon be level 52/53 and should be starting in BRD then, may even have to run it a lot. You can get like 8-10 quests for it, which really helps and gives great XP.
---
Yes same, I've been thinking about migrating (we can do it for free from our server). Everything has been a nightmare so far. My worst time was in Ferales near the Grimtotems. Everywhere I looked there were 5-10 horde players running around. Took like 2 hours to kill a few mobs and an insane respawn timer.   
---
Same in Winterspring last week. Logged in, got killed inside the inn. Respawned. Got killed again. It took me 10 minutes to just get out of Everlook and 8 deaths only to be greeted  at the Ice Thistle caves by even more hordes. It's been a constant struggle. Even entering dungeons takes about 2-3 corpse runs. But when the Alliance do dominate something it feels incredibly well.
---

---
that‚Äôs why you tank him between the stairs, tank against one wall, casters and healers against the other :D but hey, there‚Äôs a first for everything
---
Well yeah that was the point of layering. The population that remains is still healthy, though.
---
First off you should use Axe of deep woods over flurry axe, and second no quel'serrar is not worth getting even if you get edgemasters.
---
Retail is a dumpster fire and akin to a fucking mobile ~~game~~ service

Frostbolt

Funny is, it doesnt work against grenades. I rolled orc for this reason and now im stuck with it at lvl 60 and prebis.
---
Or don't dispel and let the healers get a great parse.

If someone is asking something that he could google it in first place, that means he want to see the opinion of reddit community without following blindly a guide.

Considering travelling in a city and asking the locals for the best pub and someone replies to you "[www.tripadvisor.com](https://www.tripadvisor.com)". If you believe that could be a normal answer, then we have different education level.

As an Alliance warlock, what's the best way to bait out and play around Will of the Forsaken?
---
I made a test last night. I will check again. I had 6 shards when I logged out last night. I haven‚Äôt been back in at all today. Fingers crossed.

If you want try the questie addon. It shows you all available quests all over the world so you can pick where you want to go.
---
Its really good to pop in a raid to do doom roulette for who gets to keep their world buffs and who gets sacrificed.
---
Burning Blade was a EU realm right ? can it be that this rolling need on BoE is an US thing ?
---
Insane too because the prices are outrages. I checked earlier in the week and for 1,000 gold they had it listed at $430 USD. I took this as a good thing because they dont have any gold to sell at this point.
---
Enjoy your time at the better side, good sir :P :D
---
Dude you can't just type it out like that...
---
Bis FAP
---
Sure.
---
Point is, you make that by mindlessly mouse clicking/pressing a keybind a few times while standing around. I think any amount of pay one gets for work like that is decent, as hardly any other class has a comparable option for income, except if people charge money for buffs.
---
Honestly, based on what you have said Hunter probably wouldn't be best for you. In PVP they can be quite intensive due to having to use so many different utility abilities. Their skill cap against decent enemies is high due to the deadzone and having to make use of said utility. It's also worth noting that the pet doesn't benefit from gear (at all) so in later phases the pet's damage falls off in comparison to early phases.
---
By contrast Paladin is a much safer bet considering your requirements. Their play style is more suited to your needs and they have good synergy will with other classes, which seems to be something you are after. They are also not going to instantly die by the likes of rogues. Something you have pointed out as a requirement.
---
Doubt it. There's no reason for people to run zones if they have already gotten their items from it. Pretty soon it'll take hours to put a group together and hoping for that one drop. Itll burn people out quick.
---
They drop BiS pieces, people WILL do them lag or not.
---
Danke brudi :P
---
Pets get crazy XP from dungeons if you're willing to stow it away in a corner away in a corner so it won't aggro the whole dungeon.
---
Usually I'll just do a /who 30-36 to see what people around my range are doing.  
---
 Arathi Highlands, Descolace and Dustwallow I think are around that level.

You mean phone pictures.

crazy
---
also crazy how many streamer guilds already have 1-2
---
meanwhile my guild has killed him 6 times and no weapons. Mostly junk. Did get 1 eye of rag which was sweet but otherwise junk. Most bosses have had horrible loot. 
---
Even had a sulfuron kill w/ 0 shoulder items and a vendorstrike
---
RNG is just nuts. Some guilds can clear like a boss every week for months and get jack shit while others struggle through one clear and get all the good stuff
---
in the cities you dont know if the dude that is decked spent months or a single week getting his loot
---
I definitely did step two I.e checking what I want to see (only mining nodes) 
---
I don‚Äôt recall actually enabling Mining itself as a profession.... will check later. 
---
Thankyou for your response though. 
---
Should I be expecting to see all the recorded nodes other people have collected straight away if the addon was working as intended?
---
Classic mechanics are big and clunky, but when they're failed, the fight goes tits up. We don't have 3 minute cool downs to roll over people's fuck ups like in retail.
---
but that has nothing to do with your guild and rather the person who sent it, it could have been any game
---
Naw super last priority on those haha.

Got it from a friend

1. Windows Key + Shift + S

2. Drag over the area you want to capture

3. Open imgur.com and hit CTRL + V

I've helped alliance do several quests when I can, and had help too.  I helped a shadow priest do Cuergo's gold, and he was pretty thankful. Also, had an alliance bear tank help us kill  Araj the Summoner in WPL. 
---
I've also helped alliance do escort quests if they have 3-4 mobs spawn to fight.  Its good to help if you can :D
---
\&gt;where you get your own fiber connection and your own server
---
How is it even "cloud" any longer then?
---
Run SM Armory and Cath over and over again for both levels.  Keep empty bags and vendor the trash.
---
Pawn is available, but does not have any stat weights. You would have to plug in your own (eg for a rogue, use the AEP weights from Shadowpanther).
---
Most are 
---
Wish there was a 3 strikes rule or sth.
---
This is true, but it feels like people very quickly lose perspective and start doing goofy things. I wish more of an emphasis was put on preventing deaths and overall speed, rather than just parses. 
---
Someone else in this thread hit the nail on the head: don‚Äôt dispel and let the healers parse higher. That shit doesn‚Äôt make sense.
---
Every rogue I ever interacted with says swords are better at least right now. Our only dagger rogue in the guild is daggers just so loot isnt completely wasted.
---
If you claim the sky isnt blue you are the one who needs to show proof.
---
You shouldn't be if you're MT, talk to your guild about it. If you do more threat, the entire guild can do more damage, while a rogue will only ever improve his own dps with those.
---
Sorry for your situation. Greed and need works very well where I play.
---
Being petty about 14g ...to a friend no less.
---
My favorite wow memory is.. well. Don't have any because I just started playing month ago. But if we consider it a memory then it is getting Kodo on my Tauren shaman.
---
The game only really starts at 60 regarding group content. You will do every dungeon up to 60 once or twice if you dont spellcleave, group up once in a while for elite quests, but that's about it.
---
In my 200 hours to level 60 I maybe spent 25 in groups.
---
Just level to 60 and find a guild and get raid ready.
---
Fair. I haven't actually played a high level warrior since wrath, so I'm definitely not an expert :D
---
I‚Äôve been tanking this whole play through
---
I would just keep on keepin on. Youll get the gold eventually. If you dead set on grinding some gold, the whelplings in swamp of sorrows or turtles in tanaris are good.
---
I bounced between for a while but now I think I'll stick with classic. I was just trying to get a character leveled and ended up with analysis paralysis about which class to get to max. Turns out all the classes are basically the same so it never even mattered. In classic I have a strong class identity with Warlock, and that's what matters to me the most.
---
Probably used AWS for infrastructure not directly related to the game, like websites, download servers, login servers, chat servers, etc.
---
Hunters Kite the non- casters, and mages sheep the casters. Burn down 1 at a time.
---
I mean, second winds effect is still useable for mages. I'd love to have one on my lock
---
&gt; mana doesn't regenerate while channeling
---
Doesn't it ? I thought the 5 second window started at the beginning of Mind Flay and not at the end.
---
Good catch! I was so busy fighting, that I just kind of "felt" for the custom macro button for combined Berserking and Arcane Power. Issue is, they were right beside one another and both had similar color schemes, so fumbling for them with my peripheral vision meant a mis-click on Slow Fall at first. I'd forgotten that this happened by the time I was booted off of the balcony, and when I reflexively went to do Slow Fall out in the world, it was redundant.
---
Sheep casters tank domp at chest spawn single target elites and aoe down casters sometimes aoe down elites aswell
---
If you want to rank up in phase 2 it would be a pain for sure if you're not a part of a big guild. Getting r10 in battlegrounds isn't too bad, and r12 is possible given enough time. Past that is where the real grind is.
---
you could also use weights of sixtyupgrades
---
Imagine ruining someone's day and PUG loot experience for chance to get some numbers that represent some non-existing virtual money
---
Mostly herbs. Most notably 17 black lotus
---
Back in the days I would think of 300g as a fortune, but now it's clear it's hardly that much at all. Devilsaur set alone costs almost that much, a single Epic BoE costs that much, not to mention enchants which can cost a hundred gold a pop.
---
Sheep the 4 healers, tank the 4 melee to start.
---
We then kill 2 melee first - to reduce incoming damage, then kill 2 healers while the other 2 are sheeped. When those 2 are dead we kill the other 2 healers who are now immune to sheep and finally onto the last 2 melee. 
---
I've a quick fight and this tactic 1 shotted him on our first attempt :)
---
What TPB is?
---
It starts at the beginning, but on top of that there's a rule where you can't regen during channels. With starshards for instance (6s channel) you will start regenerating the moment it ends because last time you spent mana was 6 seconds ago.
---
Keep leveling and grouping for stuff if you find people you like and they‚Äôre preparing to rsidbssk if can join their guild
---
He's not wrong. A few of my friends and I were naysayers, or at least didn't think we ourselves would be interested. Now we're hopping on and trying to get up to 60.
---
 That weapon is for shamans/paladins tho?
---
The Mage is a idiot. Its not BiS, I would have Needed it too with my Pally early on.
---
Lol the game is "out" for 2 months, a lot of people didn't even reach 60 yet. The dropout is pretty big already seeing as they where able to remove layering. Glad you enjoy it but this really isn't such a great achievement.
---
Yes usually with Gathermate Data you will Import the Data and have all the nodes displayed upon activating them.
---
Odd that it doesn't do it for you. I'm sure you have skimmed through most Options already... Maybe the Data File is corrupted or something :3
---
There's also the Timbermaw 1k healing offhand, and the 400-1200 mana one from a mage quest.
---
I will be raiding MC / Onyxia tonight! I'll update you later tonight!
---
This is Big Brain Time

Force it with fear, then coil right after and re-fear once it's over.
---
He stole from all of them because he took away their option to roll for the gold value.  He didn't need it any more than they did.
---
So I guess you live in a country that people don't ride a car/motorcycle to visit cities around but they only book flight tickets? And usually when you planning holidays you never go a little bit farther and never say "hey lets go there for a change". - Ok glad to know.

But  we are social beings and we need to listen and interact with others. That is why OP formed his question.

And that is called education my friend :)
---
Is it actually that purple there? Where is it, are you sure it's safe to go outside there?
---
Sweet! this was exactly what i was looking for, something to farm, instead of waiting for respawns. its actual gameplay, while making gold and the potential to hit the jackpot! thank you good sir
---
It breaks on damage but cant be resisted. It¬¥s just weird
---
That would be why you merge with a better one.
---
I liked this in past WoW. you could fall out from Ramparts in Tbc and land in peninsula without dying
---
Oh I missed the part where I said I was about to factually proof something. This is an opinionated and subjective angle. 
---
I already said I agreed that swords seems to be the by the numbers highest damage spec.
---
So the swedish word for bassoon?
---
Ohhh got it. Never realised since Mind Flay is only 3s but that makes sense.
---
It's not a matter of cloud vs physical, they can actually be the same thing if you choose to pay for dedicated nodes. It's a matter of resource allocation to those servers.
---
Does it actually refund the mana cost of the Flash of Light, or just the reduced amount?
---
but not the displayed effect
---
Behind what or who? Behind the fanatical 24/7 players? 99,99% of the players are there.

Lol I sold the Hunter book for 5g on day 3200
---
Can we all move to "All Roll Need on BOEs" as a new PUG rule?
---
Yeah, multiple nights for me for that one back in the day.
---
You don‚Äôt need the flight master to be alive if your flying from undercity to thorium point.
---
So he should sell the weapon to afford the enchant? What?
---
You know what? I won't - only because I have the knowledge to understand, that when people finding hard time to counter an argument they will fall for grammar or spelling mistakes.
---
Have a good day sir :\*
---
sure thing :)
---
The PirateBay
---
Sold to a guild member for 215g. Could have sold for about 250ish on ah. Fairbanks server
---
Well, I mean if it breaks on damage it's an incapacitate, and not being resisted by the orc racial is it still functioning as an incapacitate. It's not weird at all.
---
sooooo whats the big deal
---
Good.
---
Using Evasion and Sprint at the same time is the Rogue equivalent of Squirrel Tactic. 
---
Using Blade Fury, Slice and Dice and Adrenaline Rush is Monkey Style.
---
I can see you wearing your fedora in this pic.
---
I dropped skinning/tailoring for herb/alch and suddenly 16 slotters aren't cutting it anymore.
---
Quasi-rare pet dropped, literally right after I was talking to my buddy about how long it took me back in the day.  More the timing of it than anything, lol.
---
So he should sell one bis to get other bis? That seems silly.
---
Blizz allows gambling as long as you don't advertise though, right?
---
Info on how long this uses to 60?
---
I rather not migrate but have Blizzard think of a solution. If the overall number of horde and alliance across all servers are even, it shouldn‚Äôt be a problem to balance things out a bit more.
---
If you get in a fresh 0 boss down raid, you can clear trash and not get locked. If you enter an already raid that has downed bosses, you can get a lockout. If someone kills 1 trash, you'll %100 get locked to that number.
---
You are now hosed for the rest of Classic as well, lol.
---
Yes players wanted this and Blizzard announced they would remove them after a time. Blizzard could only do it after a significant portion of the players dropped of or the queues would be massive even with the larger server populations, that's why it took this long to remove them.
---
lol, im with you. if his name was like "SpermReceptacle" or something itd be different but gaybank is.. whatever.
---
what? Its like 5g on mine just like Robe of the Void, and Robe of the Archmage.
---
If u have your pet on deffensive it does that, on passive it dont.
---
Ahoy pirate!
---
Same here!
---
Nice, that was funny
---
I bet the people complaining are the same ones who always say #nochanges
---
Gehennas also has a queue starting at 3 pm every day and ramping up to several hours of waiting by 6 pm. On weekends the queue starts at noon and a week or so ago rrsulted in 8k queue on sunday evening.
---
It's just the biggest server there is.
---
Ok that second vanish just doesn't make sense.
---
I can kind of understand the vanish whilst being hit potentially causing issue, but what was that...?
---
I am experiencing this with my hunter as well. 
---
I do use two macros, but seriously doubt they are causing this effect. 
---
Petattack + defensive
---
Petfollow + passive 
---
They are a bit more involved than just that, but again, I doubt it‚Äôs a macro issue. 
---
The pet I‚Äôm using is a cat, The Rake. Wonder if pet matters.
---
My best memory was... Uhh. When I got my first binding, I guess. Never seen second one tho .\_.
---
Well, first of all it's better to hate binds on all the usefull things, like CDs (sprint, evasion, blade furry, UD racial, vanish), all consumables (I doubt '7' to '=' is practical during a fight) and maybe mount/dismount for life quality improvement.
---
I personnaly put the quick reaction spells on mouse buttons or 'R', 'F' or whatever unused key close to wasd (kicks, vanish, stuns, mostly for PvP) and all the rest on '1' to '6' with 'ctrl + x' and 'shift + x' combinations.
---
If you do not plan on hardcore raiding or PvPing, then you can ofc stay with your current setup, I just find it way unoptimized, but if it's your way of playing then fine mate :)
---
I mean you'll always get more gold. It gets easier to get every day. 
---
Why would someone who sells a bis weapon care about affording raid consumables?
---
Its Pve...... :/
---
As a hunter, how do I auto shoot when right clicking a target?  Right now right clicking tries to auto melee.  I am having to press the spell ‚ÄúAuto shoot‚Äù every time.

Join channel and post the tiananmen pasta, watch them leave in horror.

I don't think what you're describing turns into "hyuck my wife never wants to 'do the deed' hyuck." What you're describing is a more introspective and mature mentality that tends to lead to both partners changing their perspectives and goals for their relationship. What the other person was joking about was one person changing goals and perspectives while the other bemoans the lack of sex. You're describing real life. The other person was describing childish entitlement that is somehow funny to boomers and I don't get it.

---
itll be a dead game once the pvp patch hits. People rage about being ganked enough as it is, the amount of camping that will follow phase 2 will literally kill the game. No new players are going to play on a pvp server, and if they do theyll get to level 20ish and probably quit. On Herod theres already people running ganking on tweeked alts trying their hardest to get a kill. Best ones are the hunters that do that jump turn every auto attack, like holy fuck dude you're going to give yourself carpal tunnel trying that hard

The raid should stop moving and just sit next to the hounds until someone finally clicks them.

Jfc march of the inane assholes. Yes literally solo didnt happen in this one instance. I was simply trying to talk about more intimate and less structured gameplay.

Warlocks are better for PvP, but warriors are much more in demand for PvE groups, at least on my server.

You can macro auto shot into all your ranged abilities. Something like

    /cast !Auto Shot
---
    /cast Multi Shot

The dagger rogue in my raid group is typically at the bottom of us 4 rogues on the meters. I think he's using Gutgore/Distracting while the myself and the top rogue have Dal'Rends.
---
It's fine for low level greens, everything worth more than 10g is crappy.
---
thank you ill try it
---
Dropping windfury a good few seconds into the fight is actually a legit strategy to prevent ovet zealous rogues and warriors ripping aggro from the tank!

Wasn't my group, I was only in it just to get the Hydro kill for my lvl 55 water quest.

 [Trailer Park Boys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_Park_Boys)

in an average raid people can't afford to do that.

Kind of disappointing but not surprising I suppose.
---
I am a warrior. I normally hold threat pretty well when I pull groups. But this guy was pulling and then ice blocking. No charge, not a bit of dmg taken or givin to get rage.

Yes. Spec gnomish. Make all the special gnomish gizmos. Resepc goblin. Bingo bango bongo.
---
Druids are amazing levelers though! What level is your druid?
---
by the time you farm 12000 gold classic tbc will be out and you can go get an upgrade in outland
---
15 hours? Took me like 6 at most :0
---
Armor sets. Holy, prot, pvp.
---
*cries in paladin*
---
Yes, with primal fury and agi, so you crit more often.
---
For now, pre-hot yourself before a pull and tell you group to give you a few seconds to get enough aggro, at this stage you need to get hit to be able to do anything.
---
In /roll guilds it takes more than 2 hours since the entire raid is collectively half-assing it. There's no reward for putting effort in.
---
Well, it's Activision Blizzard now, so Lootboxes are encouraged.
---
This is Australia, so no, it is not safe at all to go outside. You'll be killed instantly by druid of the fang or druid of the drop claw
---
i made top 1k rogues world in m+ without a single titanforged item in bfa season 1. thats such a stupid excuse. items don't matter in order to have fun. yet i enjoy the jelly rogues who come close to inspect me &lt;3
---
Is the gold to pay for the divorce lawyers?
---
Back in vanilla I had a mod that blocked both channel invites and whispers from scammers. And then sent reports to blizz automatically.
---
As a warrior main, tanking is not too hard to learn. Try to do some instances as you level, let people know you're learning, and it wont be too hard to grow into tanking. I think overpopulation of a class will depend on your server.
---
Warriors are a low floor, high ceiling class. With the right gear, in the hands of a skilled player, and some group support, a warrior can dominate. But, a few wrong choices,  not having gear on-par with your enemy, can get you dunked on pretty quick.
---
Warlocks aren't as dependent on support. Fear will always be your best PvP spell, and it doesn't depend on gear. You shouldn't have too much trouble as a warlock getting geared. You're competing for a sizable portion of your gear with mages and priests, which are usually popular, but groups like having a warlock for utility.
---
hmm, t05 sets are pretty powerful tbh. itd make the t1 set in mc pretty irrelevant for most classes tbh.
---
Regarding the Winter's Chill talent, which provides up to 10% crit to frost spells, via debuff. I know only one mage in the party needs to have the talent for it to benefit all the mages. My question is, does this only work for the 5 man party? Or will it work for all mages in the raid group regardless of their party assignment.
---
&gt;Was I wrong?
---
Most likely yes, if the dps have time to pull b4 you do, then you are probably slow and should learn to speed up.
---
vanilla worked better than this and anyone who played back then knows it (at least handling large amount of players on screen), it's not just "rose tinted glasses"
---
This sub is such a circlejerk lol, downvoted for pointing out that if you play at the times i play high-pop are your only options, regardless of any downsides like the guy i replied to implied.
---
It's not a complaint, i literally expected it hence rolling high pop. I'm just pointing it out, your entire reply is filled with such childishness because i dared say anything negative about the game, what the hell?
---
I use the fastloot addon + autoloot and virtually never have to loot twice.
---
Unfortunately blizzard is blizzard and instead blocking it all the way, it posts a message to your chat about the chat channel invite being blocked.
---
Good thing i dont have 100g
---
&gt; Personally I want the expansions to go through in order but add scrapped content and more content where there is lacking (mainly WoD). 
---
I would want them to start with scrapped Vanilla content.
---
Eranikus quest from the trinket
---
Missing Diplomat (Add some proper end game content with Alcaz island. Add Lo'Gosh as a gladiator you can meet in Dire Maul)
---
Shady Rest Inn (This was originally added in 2.3.0)
---
The encrypted Argus Wake note from Alterac
---
And probably some more quest lines that were just left hanging.
---
It's no excuse? People are different. Getting no loot frustrates me - you only say this because you are half epic :-D If you would run every week without getting any upgrade, I think you would feel the same.
---
Ask your raidleader, or healer-group leader what assignment you should fulfill.
---
Most importantly: Be aware of where you stand and where you should be.
---
Healing wise: Hots are almost useless, as they will just be overhealing. Usually healers will be assigned to certain targets, so focus on those. Make use of the 5-second-rule, so try to bunch your heals up, so can regen a while.
---
Depending on your raid, it might not matter all that much, since you might have more than enough healers anyway, so you can focus on learning the fight mechanics.
---
HOW HARD CAN IT BE BLIZZARD! FFS
---
It refunds the full amount.
---
pretty sure, i tested it with more then 20 nades. The resists come from resisting the damage (fire resi) and the stun with it.
---
Ah that brings back some memories lol.
---
no, its worse.
---
16 spell damage &gt; 1% hit
---
Bud. Im European. It was 9:30am when I posted ^^
---
Pop MCP on bosses and your dps can pop off pretty instantly. Combo it with the talent that gives rage on yellow crit and you can outdps with maul spam.
---
I was lucky when doing that. Only one person camping, and from my faction, so I teamed up with them and got the kills I needed, while agreeing to let them have essences if they dropped.
---
But how have you been so bad at saving until now? I never grinded for gold and i bought mount with gold to spare right as i dinged. Shaman.
---
My blind macro says "Carebearz throws pocket samd SH SH SHA!" 
---
I really wish horde could see it
---
Hmm interesting, didn‚Äôt think of that
---
Debuffs on target are raid wide.
---
Its a debuff on target so its raid wide i asume
---
The more knowledge spreads, the happier I am to be tauren. Hamstringing mages out of frost nova range is marvelous - and pretty broken.
---
Vanilla didnt have phases.
---
btw. we're playing 1.12.... lmao
---
https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1109391-raid-id-multi-generation/
---
That is so frustrating to read this comments... Here i am fury with 8 MC clear IDs and the only fury item dropped in ALL IDs together is one time the hands and i didn't even got it... RNG is a bitch
---
Renew on tanks is very good though.
---
Did you do a decent sample size? You have a 5% stun resist chance by default, so maybe it was just luck.
---
This also not the first documented.
---
I doubt that Blizzard did add Swedish words to their name blacklist.
---
A report on the other hand might or might no result in a forced name change.
---
Thats why I only sell expensive items to 60s or at least in person via /trade. I got quite a lot of COD offers for my freezing band from lvl 1 banksters.
---
how about you go to classic.warcraftlogs.com and check parses from top guilds?
---
Or the demand is high?
---
I vaguely remember this sort of thing happening in vanilla wow. When trying to run out of caves etc then boom one shot when the mobs catch you
---
Honestly, while mine isnt dead at all, getting quest help for elites is a struggle on mine in certain zones  
---
Its sad :(
---
HERE, A WHEPLING - NOW HANDLE IT!
---
Long as it‚Äôs them doing it you mean
---
This has been mentioned in most similar threads, too, but doesn't ring true: it's about as influental as DM gear is in a post-1.10 itemized world - it makes the pre-raid gear pool a bit better, but is far from game breaking.
---
(Not to mention that in many ways the game is already broken, just look at the current raid parses - with that kind of DPS, it's safe to say that all of classic's PvE content will be on farm mode the day it's released.)
---
I am going to be brutally honest with you.
---
&gt; Ive always been a good healer but in classic..man im really bad at it lol
---
I don't think so you were a good healer. Because...
---
&gt; I dont think full resto is that better to get me more healing.
---
You are literally missing 10% healing from the healing tree alone.
---
Also you have to know your limits on mana. If you are out of the fight with 70% mana then you could have ignored the 5 second rule more often or used higher ranks for chain heal.
---
Rest is the same as in retail or other expansions, you gotta heal before your other healers are healing.
---
Check if your other healers are padding their logs, our healers are usually not doing much so they heal the pets for the logs.
---
If there's not much to heal for you, you can also do totem twisting to give your melees extra crit &amp; AP (not warriors).
---
Rank 1 isn't all that great. Use the lowest rank that still has the full cast time, as it has the full healing power scaling
---
At least you can see those pesky rogues and also you got BiS weapon skill for your sick healing to slap people in pvp with haha
---
Why moon when you can use Faerie Fire?
---
Renju too. Problem is, you can only have one of them on a tank at a time. The highest geared healers will do that. If its his first raid, it wont be him.
---
What you don't understand is that the fast times are what inflate the dps. In my 2 minute kill, my rogue did 450 dps. I was the 4th highest dps. Many of our players were below 250 dps. If everyone was doing damage at the rate I was, we'd have killed the boss much faster and every person would have had significantly higher dps due to our cooldown burst windows being a larger portion of the overall kill time. That may not necessarily apply to warlocks without toep, but as a combat rogue, my dps is very dependent on the burst of AR/BF. The higher the percentage of fight I have cooldowns up (shorter fight time due to other dps being on par) it would inflate my dps numbers. The only reason you're seeing warriors and rogues hitting 1000 dps is because the fight ended very quickly (55s iirc). Of course they could not possibly sustain that for another 55s. So, by having every dps member doing very high damage, it makes the fight end sooner, which makes everyone's dps much higher than if they had to go another minute.
---
Level to 57, respec to prot, live in  dungeons for a week or two, emerge in full fury gear and start your endgame in raids.
---
No reason really to stay fury or arms as there is nothing worth more than just spamming dungeons the whole time until you are raid ready. Farming dungeons also covers your gold needs as you get a fair coin by just doing dungeon quests at level 60 that yield 4-6g each.
---
Play what you want man. Arms is arguably better before 60 but it depends on your playstyle and team setup. Either spec work just fine tho so don't worry about swapping whenever.
---
It's an add-on called something like server friends only.
---
They won't turn to Alterac Swiss overnight you know?
---
I went full in by rolling wrong race, class, faction and server.
---
I rerolled to a different server on another faction and I'm enjoying the game much more than my first character.
---
There are good tutorials out there. "aura indicator" is the keyword to look for.
---
Nope it's a stun
---
My main is a warrior. Arms at the moment but probably speccing prot soonish.
---
I have a mage and a hunter at about level 30 but I don't know which to progress with.  
---
It's going to be my soloing and farming char (and world PvP I guess) since prot warriors aren't the best at efficiently farming gold. 
---
So can't decide which will be best later on. Hunters are great for killing elites, tribute runs, kiting bosses etc.
---
Mages are I guess good for AoE farming and such.
---
Any thoughts?
---
Can you read his post? Nowhere does he suggest killing the pet, he suggest waiting out the duration to CC the pet and blast the hunter
---
Then dont install it
---
Pretty sure you're wrong.   It's a stun and if orc resist isn't working on it that's a bug.
---
still exciting to get a purple though isn't it, ya buzzkill
---
This is so helpful but I'm gonna leave it off so I can report every seller I possibly can...
---
Its not your business how others play their game, if you want to put yourself in a disadvantage because you cant learn simple addons its not others fault.
---
Holy Paladin!!! That‚Äôs about 12 hours a day, every day since launch in August. That‚Äôs astounding.
---
Doubt
---
&gt;Mich w√ºrde mal interessieren, seid ihr immer IC oder nur wenn ihr euch z.B. mit euren Gildies trifft?
---
Ich habe auch nie RP gemacht, aber meine Gildies scheinen nur zu Events IC zu spielen. 
---
Manchmal wird man von zuf√§lligen Charakteren "angespielt", aber das fand ich bisher immer zu weird um mich drauf einzulassen.
---
Gotta love when the most worthless epic drops.
---
Why would you want to enforce your own rules if the party wants to go faster? Except for mana breaks for the healer you can always pull the next pack.
---
I'm not a naysayer but I think in phase 2 there will be a significant population drop. World bosses and world pvp is simply not enough to keep people engaged for long. But in phase 3 people will flock back so fast that we will have huge queues again
---
Whyd you move your name but not your targets...
---
Why is this a YouTube video
---
Im on mirage eu I get one every couple of days
---
Cloud infrastructure means nothing, servers are servers.
---
What?
---
You are complaining about 13 year old ad ons ruining - 14 year old game. It‚Äôs been played like this on private servers before you thought about playing classic
---
Bring mana potions, even small ones (700-900) help out quite a bit and are very cheap.
---
You should also mention your class as the suggestions would be very different.
---
My point still stands. Ignore me talking to you, this was meant in general.
---
you think 500 water does take up alot of bag space? you think i wouldn't rather spend those 20 mins killing mobs for money/loot and shards ? it isn't our responsibility to provide you with water you could just buy yourself.
---
My wife and I always joked that if we'd ever buy a dog we'd name him Loot.

Loot, the dog.

Inverse the order of your macro
---
It‚Äôd be so funny if they just gave you a crap ton of alcohol...
---
Might be 10 for this one havent checked a few days but it worth nothing basically
---
Yup! Depending on the speed of the weapon I use and the proc rate, I imagine it will start out as dotting like normal...but then after a few good stabs my weapon will proc, my firestone will proc, my fiery enchant will proc, and who knows maybe even a trinket will proc and it will basically be like an incredibly ‚Äúghetto‚Äù version of windfury... ü§£
---
Don‚Äôt listen to these people , I‚Äôm 2 hand fury alliance and I‚Äôm the top DPS in my raid group, I beat out every other duel wield warrior on every boss fight. They all have HOJ and SGC , I do not. 2 of them have Lionheart helm, I do not. And 1 of them has Brutality blade
---
Ding 60, regret your class choice and start over. Takes 6 days played for me for 60.
---
I relate hard to this :(
---
Try leveling a warrior with only fisting. :D
---
Yeah, I actually want this little second or 2 pause. Because then I won't lose a second or 2 of pet dps here and there when I'm not fast enough to switch my pets target
---
2019 and we still can't find the god damn print screen button.
---
Damn, I need part 2 of that. At least my other half understand it's not just a game and there are actually humans relying on me when I say I'll be 5mins (Though totally been in the situations of 'ill be 5' but actually an hour)
---
Or just printscreen since you're probably in fullscreen anyway. As a bonus it is saved to wow screenshots folder.
---
yes of course, I wasn't saying it wasn't, I just thought it was funny that 2 people actually rolled need on it. This sub is sensitive as hell though lmao
---
Same mate, I won't block the channel invites. I'll report every single one of those accounts.
---
Honestly, i feel sorry for you. A subreddit about a game we all ostensibly love and this is you‚Äôre contributions. Flinging turds at someone just trying ti celebrate a cool moment. Goos for you ‚Äúbro‚Äù
---
This is what I do.  You can‚Äôt right click the name in the invite, but if you join, and find the channel owner, you can report them, and then leave the channel.
---
Those number can't be right...
---
Thanks guys
---
It was one of the first differences I noticed when playing classic, I'm pretty sure pets used to immediately return to us upon mob death.
---
There was a popup that said do you want to enter the instance, you will get locked to a ID when it wasnt fresh in some point, i think.
---
If you are a paladin or shaman you are more likely to stack mp5 than spirit, so 5-sec-rule won't be as big a benefit to you as to priest or druid. That said, during periods of low damage, you should still try to utilize it. Bring way more mana potions than you think you will need, and all Dark Runes/Demonic Runes (or whatever those sacrifice life-gain mana ones are called, I forget). 
---
Remain aware of your surroundings and any relevant raid mechanics at all times rather than tunnel visioning your target or the raid frames. Whenever you are casting, you get 1.5-3 sec to evaluate the situation and change your order of action as appropriate.
---
Fittkittlaren got away with some reports apparently so I guess it's not that sensitive anymore.
---
A Golden Eye remake would be amazing. Don't change anything except the graphics. It'd be great.
---
Something keeps triggering my pocket rocket...

Damn it. I was really looking forward to that.

I suppose it's better to know now though than be disappointed finding this out later.

how to know you lost an argument, you go after their spelling instead of the content of what they said. Good job.
---
So i am not allowed to advertise gambeling for gold in og?
---
Collect blue pearls off the coast of STV (By grom gol). They sell for 20-40s each depending on your server and you can collect 10 in 20-30 minutes.
---
Me too:
---
* Release Karazhan (rebalanced for lvl 60?)
---
* Create/finish Uldum
---
* Expand into empty area of the existing map

/sign to Xhukari‚Äôs bullets as wel
---
Pretty much. I'm logging in once a week right now to clear MC+ony with my guild while waiting for pvp, can't come soon enough.
---
I take it you got Mining? Well you're a Mage, they're great at making money. So I'd argue a different route; skip Tailoring for now. Relearn Engineering for the Goblin goodness. When done,  drop Mining for Tailoring. 
---
Tailoring has uses later, too. Iirc, the set bonus of Bloodvine (2% Crit) is Tailor 300 only... Something to consider. :)
---
Thank you.  
---
Right now I have a macro that sends my pet in and starts auto shoot.  I have just been wondering if I was missing something.  
---
I played back in the days, a few months before TBC came out so I could not recall wether or not I had the same issue then.  It just gets old having to press something to auto shoot versus simply right clicking.
---
Why did I have to scroll a lot to finally found the right answer? You have to communicate properly. Don't just get pissed off and leave, then try to rationalize your actions. The healer seems like a nice person, and you screwed him over in the process.
---
Based on years in private servers, guilds will go through shamans like crazy. You will NEVER have enough of em. Aka, you are going to be fine.
---
listings for 25g expire on my server (westfall horde). No idea if it'll go up, but I held onto the one I got just in case.
---
Axe of deep woods still better for the racial hit %. Be happy you'll save tons of gold buying it instead of forors. I'm using aodw and flurry and have fury tanked a bit. Went fine
---
My Fellow nogger!  
---
Are you horde or alliance?  
---
We are a lot of nice people on this server, that would be sad to loose a nice player! i myself is in a very casual guild :D
---
I avoid mages like the plague. All of the negative interactions I've had with other Horde because of toxicity were exclusively mages.
---
I've had mages refuse to group while they were AoE grinding mobs I needed for quests, mages that refuse to help kill elites, and mages just being general "lol git gud noob im busy" assholes when I ask for help.
---
Warriors conversely have been the nicest. Many of them have charged in to save me from bad situations without being asked at all.
---
The mage meta just attracts a lot of dickheads, and that's coming from an UD Rogue.
---
At least, I'm a dickhead to THE OTHER SIDE while still remaining helpful to Horde players.
---
Yeah, it wouldn't really be fair to priests otherwise as MC is like their signature spell.
---
We stopped sheeping and simply pull all adds to one spot, killing them all there with aoe.
---
mmmmm wotlk Disc Priest, now those were the days.
---
Addons are not that big of a deal, youll perform slightly better in some situations, nothing special.
---
Stop playing on US realms. I've seen nothing but generosity and kindness on EU realms. It's something about the language barrier that stops people from being too confident and thus dicks.

You know I actually was interested in watching the crafting of this weapon. But I opened the video and there's asmong talking with a bunch of text and a tiny thumbnail of what's actually happening and closed it.
---
no, just the damage.
---
I left Wow and went to play Eve online around 2008 after TBC was done. 11 years later I left Eve for classic. I wouldn't be going back to retail if I left classic, It'd be some other game.
---
I‚Äôve actually been able to right click the name lately on the invite 
---
I feel like I could not do that a few weeks ago but I can now
---
I'm talking about cc that prevents normal casting..  not roots yes blink removes roots too good job.
---
Anyway the grenades a stun and I'm fairly sure your testing is dogshit because I doubt it's bugged.
---
Oh god, thanks
---
Ugh, that looks terrible
---
Counter is actually warriors though, rogue vs rogue is a wash
---
Are arcanite Crystal's always going to be worth what they are now?
---
What UI are you using?
---
Fury warrior is the best DPS in the game though so while a guild may only have a few tank spots they‚Äôll have a number of dps warriors as well. Warriors and mages are the two most common classes and usually the two most represented in a raid as well.
---
He responds in the comments when asked about what addons he uses. 
---
omnicc/ClassicAuraDurations for timers, Weakauras for the debuffs over their head
---
&gt;new
---
Yeah. Most people also think grenades will break on damage.
---
All grenades apply 2 stacks of incapacitate. Meaning, 1st hit against the target will not remove the effect. 2nd hit will, though.
---
While the tooltip says that the target is stunned, it also says that it breaks on damage - which is the definition of how an incapacitate effect, Gouge for instance, works. I believe this was reworded later on, like in a later expansion? Anyhow, I believe the Orc resist thing is a pserver anomaly.
---
Here's the [definition of incapacitate](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Incapacitate). 
---
Also, I don't believe Mages should be able to blink this, have no memory of ever seeing it. The article linked above also clearly states that while Blink can be used to break out of stuns, it can't break incapacitate effects. u/Domillomew are you absolute sure that mages can blink it? I don't buy it.
---
Yep, I've been got by the small lustrious pearls. It's worth making a ticket. The GM won't give your money back, but they will warn the person, and possibly ban them if it's not their first time.
---
I think there are 2 different values here. He thinks DBM and threat meters discourage and reduce communication (but this kind of communication just becomes repetative over time) and addons don't grant the same feeling of learning through mistakes as much. You value success, speed, effiency or whatever else.
---
Which is the best healer alliance-side for pvp later stages (rolling an alt).
---
My choices are:
---
Priest - the most fun looking one.
---
Paladin - supposedely it gets better late stages for pvp heal
---
Druid - way easier to get gear but is it viable for pvp healing at all?
---
IIRC, you could only do that after the first christmas event, no?
---
I do
---
The Lasitors send their regards
---
true. no reason to spec fury untill ur raidleader says so. arms/prot is optimal spec for you
---
if you don't like my post just downvote it, no need to try to "correct" my posting style. what a dork 
---
Here, just in cast the couple downvotes here didn't give you enough feeling of authority, here's a page full of my comments for you to browse.

Takes some time to customize, but it's pretty cool.
---
I'm on arcanite reaper. The population is extremely low, and my normal times to play are outside of Primetime. While I may be more in demand, even dps can be hard to replace.
---
I found hunter pretty good 1-10 as long as you know how to properly kite and hit in between weapon swings.
---
If you use a mail add on that opens all mail will that automatically take and pay for these or is there a confirmation?
---
Is there some kind of cross faction communication directory? Would be interesting to see
---
I use NeatBars. :)
---
I thought it was fun
---
that's a good idea
---
I mean, yeah. I'm sad that this community treats women like shit sometimes.
---
25 gold doesn't seem like a lot for 1300 expected kills for an 80% dropchance. 
---
Thats 1.9 silver per welpling.
---
Jokes on them! I only have a few gold to my name!
---
That's a lot of death!
---
Same here, √† little older but 4 of us buddies would skip class for whole afternoons to splitscreen the shit out of this game
---
you can still use it between friends and guildies. 
---
being friends doesn't mean you have to give eachother all stuff for free, it's perfectly normal to buy and sell stuff among each other. I often use COD in guild.
---
Can Mages blink out of grenades? I always thought grenades incapacitate you, not stun. And Blink is for breaking stun, not sure what to think here.
---

Our Master Looter and the guy who holds the BOEs are both warlocks.
---
Rip bag space.
---
A hunter with Skinning and maybe Herbalism could make decent money as well as being able to farm easily. I recommend leveling the hunter. They also end up having good ranged damage end game and a wolf with furious howl can be a good buff for melee DPS.
---
Genius!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Only tryhards wouldn't invite warlocks and mages at all, and use those consumables you've listed.
---
What testing are you talking about? Lol. You're getting riled up and having a conversation that no one else is having.
---
Where are you getting this from?
---
It's actually 3rd/4th pre raid rings for locks. Pretty close in power to underworld band. Worse than maidens/eye of org, but better than unicorn
---
It's 100% a stun and mages can blink it off.
---
When I applied for it, do you get back to me via Email or does it just magically appear in my shared tab on my drive?
---
just out of curiosity :)
---
This is not original vanilla! Everything is nerfed. 1.12 is a later patch with a bunch of balancing changes, its a later vanilla patch.
---
&gt; I'm looking for a class that has those 'ah nice' moments. Big crits that  settle a fight without needing too much skill. Sounds silly, but I feel  like not getting those every so often would put me off playing the  class this is eg why I scrapped druids from the list. 
---
Warlock has this though, as SM/ruin or a more memey seduction -&gt; soulfire build your crits are insane. I can crit for 2.5k on my lock and it nearly one shots players.
---
Priest for healing PvP id say. Paladin is really good 2 and druid is more of a flag carry/base guard character
---
No, you don‚Äôt.
---
They shouldn't be.
---
Sorry thought you were op who made this thread after testing 20 grenades.
---
Once you hit Scholo/UBRS/Strat/DM you will want to use the prot talents or have a super geared healer. 
---
Some of that trash hits super hard and tanking 3-4 mobs just over comes your HP or the healers mana pool. 
---
I did this with my warrior until 1 bar from 60 and had issues when people would open up with AoE. 
---
Working on my prot pali now as my dungeon farmer.  Palis are super broken if you know how to exploit the class.
---
Yes, they can
---
Totally agree and it‚Äôs funny how the majority think it‚Äôs a good argument depending on the topic. 
---
If you‚Äôre debating add on then it‚Äôs not your business what people do?
---
If you‚Äôre debating an optional lfg tool: it will kill the game!

sounds like you should level a warlock. Smooth leveling because of pet and dot centric gameplay, nice for raiding and farming, great utility with summon, curses, health/soul stone. Maybe give it a try if you like casters.
---
Hunter is even faster to level, and an awesome farm class. Also offers solid DPS in MC/BWL, so don't worry about people telling you their damage falls of in AQ/Naxx. Cant go wrong with it, if you like the game play mechanics.
---
Druid is smooth to level as well (after you get cat at 20) but at 60 you are mainly stuck at healing.
---
sm/ruin is typically a hybid build for a reason - you'd have one for both. if you are respecing anyway, respec to ds/ruin for raids and e.g. nf/conflag for pvp.
---
But if you do want seperate versions of it - the biggest difference is that in pvp you can spend the points from Supression elsewhere (wherever you chose.)
---
Not really. This is a very different perspective from the other commenters bemoaning the lack of sex in their marriage and whining about their wives "laying down the law of less gaming".
---
Okay....lol.
---
Usable underwater \^\^
---
Can't understand why you'd go through the trouble of  removing such an idiots name
---
BRD aoe runs
---
Your guild is awesome. That game is not
---
Just spam chain heal lol
---
They were pretty sneaky using 2 or 3 to bait you into the open with 10-12 more waiting to swoop in from either side
---
From playing the damn game and countless used iron and thorium grenades, as well as a handful of big ones?
---
This is my recollection and interpretation as well, but seeing some oddly mixed opinions voiced [in here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dp4o36/orcs_cant_resist_engineering_grenades_in_wow/).
---
Yeah, and its not even cheap &gt;.&gt;
---
I dont think you can rezz the opposing faction.
---
Paladin is the best, but groups will still want some priests for dispels (and fear wards).
---
Shhhhhhhh.
---
I‚Äôm throwing up legendary parses and topping my server because I‚Äôm tanking both dogs. Don‚Äôt ruin this for me.
---
both are super fast to level (if you aoe as a mage) and super to farm with. You can't go wrong with either, so it is more a matter of playstyle (caster vs physcal ranged dps). From a QoL standpoint mage shines a bit more because of food/water and portals though
---
I like that so i can report them.
---
Nice tank loot!
---
Enjoy doing 0 dps in pve with that spec.
---
And if you‚Äôre a PvP player... enjoy no bgs or honor
---
I'm on that server as well. I second the advice to just go out into the world, do your quests and don't be shy to communicate to other people that you meet while questing or traveling around. You'd be surprised how many friendships I have made by just saying "Hi, are you doing quest X? Do you want to group up?" and then just getting into a conversation from there.
---
Some are friends for a day, others have become friends for over 10 years.
---
But don't just wait for people to talk to you.
---
I personally don't like to join big guilds that spam invites instead of talking to you, but guilds might be a good way to meet new people too.
---
Confirmed all but Demonfork and Flamewrath so far, spell ratio is 1:1
---
I see that, what server?
---
Sorry I am not sure. The thing is the more spelldmg you have the better hit/crit will be as well.
---
Warlocks have no hit talents so they can only get like 4-5% in P1 IIRC.
---
I would guess 1% of hit would be around 15 spelldmg as well but can't say for sure. It will be worth more in later phases though.
---
Well is it worth 1500g thats the question you should be asking yourself
---
I normally like to switch it up myself, but i thought this time ill try and just stay in silverpine. I did one run of RFC and WC which gave me around 2 levels with the few quests i had. If i didn't go do the instances i would of needed to grind them 2 levels out,as silverpine seems to be lacking in quests.
---
I've just started in tarren mill at level 20. Again, normally i wouldn't do this but looking to mix things up!
---
Me and everyone on the server discord. Obviously subjective since no data exists.
---
They really do. Horde dodge like little bitches. Were were Horde yesterday? Allies literally stomped the shit out of Kargath and Horde guilds kept trying to sneak into BRM through the southern entrance. When did APES lose in a large engagement?
---
get real
---
EZ.
---
why does that matter?
---
A lot of people can‚Äôt even deviate 2 hours a day
---
And ?
---
Yeah, I had a talk with our dps warriors, and explained my stance on it. Some of them actually tried to encourage me to roll on the gear, but as you said, threat is not a concern at this time, so better that they get geared up so we kill bosses faster, and I can worry more about threat gear as phase 3 approaches.
---
Seems to be one person going against everyone. I could test this later today but I'm pretty sure mages shouldn't be able to blink out.
---
Arugal
---
I know what drain tanking is.
---
What is yeet?
---
I usually play on PVP servers but went PVE this time around and it's still pretty weird walking through here and not seeing bones everywhere because I always remember it just being a complete massacre every time I walked in. Not usually this bad though haha
---
Have not leveled Engineering this time around, but can't recall this being a thing in Vanilla. 
---
I have however noticed that when people are insecure in their answers, they tend to write in an offensive manner.
---
It's for higher levels though.
---
&gt;Doesn't it 
---
Mana ticks start 5 seconds after the last time you cast a spell period
---
Switch at 60 when you have some + hit gear. The reason people level with a 2H is dual wielding increases your chance to miss and there isn‚Äôt a lot of hit gear before 60.
---
What zone is this in?
---
That was a girl, not a guy.
---
I ended up doing the "normal" method using shadow protection potion and wingclip, got it in first try using that method :p
---
Yes :)
---
I would defenitely leave the guild. Fck those dudes if they don't want you because of a stupid shield.
---
Be quick and you might fidn a new one for this ID before they start MC. GL HF
---
WotF is short enough for DC to neutralize it. Melee get the amplified CoEx treatment
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iciVTrVeYis
---
no pvp, lagged to shit (everyone is running in place)
---
Oof.  We brought a level 55 warrior through there last night. We had to pull a grand total of one extra pack.  58 is more than fine for ubrs.
---
You'll have to be more specific. Which second spell cast bar do you mean? The one for your own spells? If so, I don't know if you can deactivate it and still keep the weapon swing timer, just try it?
---
If you only want the weapon swing timer, why don't use the addon Weapon Swing Timer? You can even make that one to look simple by removing the borders, colors, text and length/height of the bar.
---
Just have to look in the options.
---
Thanks fam ‚ô•
---
Well, you could also check one of the hundreds PvP videos with nades used on youtube. Like this one.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L0FPmRc6W0
---
Warlock: really stong in PvP, but needs some gear to be dencent, otherwise rogues/hunters/warriors will just kill you with 2 crits. Leveling is really smooth, farming as well.
---
Warrior: Slow to level, needs very good gear to be at least a bit of a threat in PvP, really shines when coupled with a healer buddy. For PvP you at least want some 2Hd weapon from MC (or AV Exalted once it is available). Gearing for DPS gear can be a bit tricky since it is the most populated class. During leveling you can tank any dungeon if you just have mail/plate gear and a shield, so you get fast invites ("fast" in comparison to the slow paced gameplay of classic).
---
For both classes I strongly recommend going Orc (if Horde), the 15% stun resistance is too valuable to miss.
---
I think Silverpine is more enjoyable placed to quest as the Barrens has orc/trolls and tauren all converging there. At busy times, quests mobs are well farmed. Takes longer to do quests. 
---
I'm with you...I'm doing things a little different this time on my 2nd Char.  I didnt quest at all in Desolace on my main, so definitely going there from about level 35.
---
Totally agree, look at the spy add on lol, literally a wall hack type of thing. Feel bad for the rogues who can‚Äôt be that stealthy
---
Not true, knowledgeable players know that bis lists get shit wrong.
---
LOL Boralus would have like 1/20th the people seen in that video. #RetailIsDead
---
Like a reverse yoink
---
Stop stabbing them in the dew glands then!
---
Yup only reason
---
you have a *shadow priest* in your group who's using MC proactively in sm cath (as opposed to a healer who would have to stop healing) and you decided to get mad at him because you were putting skull on scarlet wizards and he was MCing them
---
you're the dumb one bub, scarlet wizards have thorns and no-cooldown arcane explosion, if you mind control one you can do a bazillion dps with it, draw agro, and watch it die
---
MCing scarlet wizards in cath is legitimately better dps than an aoe spec mage
---
and you probably ignored his explanation because "i'm the tank, i don't need to listen to the words you're saying because i wear the pants"
---
I mean it makes sense.  Why else would this site exist lol https://nostalri.us/eu I just don‚Äôt want to mess up my guild schedule.  I missed Ony on vacation and wanna squeeze a pug in before the guild run.
---
I feel like this situation would have been fixed if he asked the group if he could roll need for this reason, especially if no one else needed. I would have been fine giving it to him for this. 
---
Clicking need then apologizing retroactively is not favorable.
---
Criiiiiiiiiiinge
---
That's hardly a scam though.
---
Yeah it can be pretty brutal some nights. A bit of context, this was my 4th corpse run trying to get past Alliance haha
---
I dunno who they you're talking about, but our dagger rogue pumps insane dps. I think ghennas he was at almost 800 dps?
---
It‚Äôs possible, but would need heavy upfront investment.
---
But my crit chance increases as my weapon skill improves?
---
Well they cant as more than the bare minimum like dbm, details etc which is a must have to be able to raid or else you will just run around do random dps or random heal someone? Honestly if someone dont want to integrate in a big community thats not the communitys problem. Make a guild where you dont have to use addons and see how succesful will it be.
---
clicker!!! omg!!!
---
What u said is correct. U can kill her twice in 2 days
---
That‚Äôs true. Didn‚Äôt think about that.
---
It‚Äôs the first Epic I‚Äôve seen dropped in Classic so I got pretty excited. In retrospect this item is pretty worthless, I just checked the AH lol. I‚Äôve gotten greens from the Barrens worth more.
---
I totally want a barbershop and guild bank too.  
---
    
---
Starting in classic wotlk and classic tbc respectively.
---
I don't think it's incompetence, it's a return on investment calculation, they don't think it will matter for 99% of the players, and they think it would cost far more money than investing in the hardware and the software time to make it work.
---
If you kill her, the reset timer doesn‚Äôt start there at 5 days. It was already counting down. Is that what you‚Äôre asking?
---
I thought you could only use pummeler 3 times ever?
---
You are doing god‚Äôs work
---
No, thank you. Have a nice day lmao.
---
This totally would have worked on me
---
Thank you.  I just wanted some clarification. I did not want to lock myself out of guild run doing a pug.
---
well they did die yday and they have died many times at the STV arena 80 vs 80, they also died last week going to MC with full world buffs inside BRM but that was a huge lagfest
---
Mists of Pandaria, while one of the best expansions when it came to class/spec design, was the one that made dailies mandatory. So much of your preraid bis came from reputation, and rep only came from dailies. They also uncapped the number of dailies you could do in a day. It wasn't uncommon for me to doing 40-50 dailies a day. Every single day.
---
But I liked tbc/wotlk dailies. They didn't feel mandatory, provided a small amount of gold for doing them, and reputation vendors had some gear you could use to supplement bad rng in raids.
---
Ya that‚Äôs exactly what happened, I asked in chat if ‚Äúboth need?‚Äù and he agreed since I‚Äôve seen a lot of ninja posts.
---
dude wtf?
---
/cast Conjure Money
---
Priest if you want to press more than one button and be objectively the best healer. 
---
Paladin if you are ok with button mashing one heal spell, and prefer the satisfaction of knowing you bring indispensable support through buffs. 
---
Druid if you are ok with having the lowest healing output but want to be full to the brim of tricks, and utility; also the best choice if you want to gear up quickly and don't have time to commit to raiding often.
---
Well 1 and 2 aboslutely yell "Rogue", a rogues worst nightmare is a warrior, the best class for group pvp is any healer (it is not uncommon e.g. in WSG to have one team with just dps and one with one healer, guess who will win 90% of the time).
---
Does not sound like you want to play hunter. 
---
But speaking as a warlock myself: PvP is a blast with it, although I do not have the problem of fighting against Undeads though. But Rogues are one of the two counters to warlock (the other is a geared warrior and if you don't have gear, hunters are really bad as well), so you are probably dead if one gets to you anyways. So my honest recommendation would be getting some PvP gear (T1 set is really good because of lots of stamina) plus engineering for those grenades and I promis you that you will have a blast with it
---
It seems like there are way too many tanks for raids everywhere. We also have a ton of warriors who want to tank. We keep them as offtanks, but still ... it isn't ideal. Others guilds have the same "problem" and we get loads of warriors asking to join us because they cannot tank raids in their guilds. But we don't need them either.
---
Yes basically. Trying to confirm that she resets for everyone on 10/31 @ 3:00.  (US)(EST)
---
I strongly considered it if I wouldn‚Äôt of been relatively close to having my mount money at 40
---
Yea silverpine is great in that regards, i think i seen one cow in 10 levels and like you said, less competition for quests mobs is good but also less people for group quests is bad. Also silverpine is more compact so less running when compared to the barrens.
---
i like to head desolace when the first wave of quests become green. i got 2 levels in a short period of time doing easy quests. Best thing about desolace is there is hardly anyone ever there and lots of grinding quests.
---
Make a hunter alt and use it.
---
I had a twink hunter with equipped nightblade for laughs, people got so triggered over it.
---
It‚Äôs a set reset time, every 5 days. You could kill her on day 1 or day 4 and it‚Äôll still reset on day 5. Does not matter when you kill her.
---
It's more like a slur...
---
prob not much. might be worth a g or 2 if you can find a buyer
---
Try this tactic with hunters. If they are max range, do your best to get in range to load up all of your instant dots. amplify CoA. Then just start running away. They will use cheetah to chase you down. This is where you put your pet on them to daze them. When your dots have ran out he will have lost most of his HP and you switch oles, he has become the hunted. Use DC or CoEx to catch and finish them.
---
If you are too squishy and they can nuke you down before you know what's going on it'll be tough though. Try to get more stam gear for open world play and always keep SS up.
---
When i'll choose an Engineering Specialization? At 300 skill or 225?
---
And can you please give me some noticable items between Goblin and Gnome Engineering?
---
Generic tips and tricks
---
* Don't buy every skill at the trainer - As a rogue using swords for example, Backstab and Ambush are two skills you're never going to use and as such there's not really any point in learning higher ranks. Ask yourself what skills do you use often, and keep those upto date.
---
* Pickpocket everything, within reason - Pickpocket may seem like a novelty at first but you can make some extra silver on the side but it all adds up in the end.
---
* Junk and you - Bag space not being an issue, you should grab junk mobs drop to sell to a vendor at your earliest convenience. I'd recommend the "Vendor Prices" addon that actually tells you how much things sell for to a vendor when you mouse over them. At higher levels you could feasibly be making 1-2g just from junk items each time you return to town. Much like pickpocketing it all adds up.
---
You should try to start with setting basic key binds like strafe left and right ,  bind them to A and D for instance.
---
The reason to use strafe rather than the default key binds is that you can move and cast spells/abilities while moving more easy (i.e. using 1 key to move instead of using 2).
---
For the rest it's just personal preference, play around with keybinds until you find what suits your playstyle best.
---
If you want to learn more tips and tricks specifically for rogues you should try and watch famous rogue streamers, learn from their positioning, cooldown usage etc. etc.
---
You still get a notification in chat that you can right click and report. All this does is block the pop up window.
---
Do you use joanas? I‚Äôm planning on leveling an alt and not sure if I want to grind, dungeon, or use a guide to get there the fastest. I had about 11 days played on my hunter to 60 which obviously wasn‚Äôt trying to be efficient. Now it‚Äôs Druid time and dungeons may be an easy option?
---
Have you perhaps resolved the problem?  
---
I've looked into my resource monitor and seems my harddisk was the problem got the game on an HDD perhaps i'll try and put it on the SSD. Both are pretty full tho meeeh.
---
I guess i could be wrong, but I've never heard of that before.
---
Thanks! Appreciate your reply :)  I think the other thing I struggle with is when I am in a party what do I even say? Like how best to strike up conversation with others besides just talking about the quest we are doing?
---
Pick Gnome!
---
Ah, perhaps. Cooldowns are sub-300 so I figured they meant 300 skill in various professions for top end patterns and stuff.
---
any tank (warrior or feral), Shaman/Priest healer (both because of heals, Shaman also because of WF Totem, we have an abundance of fury warriors and rogues that will love you for it). Druid healers are usually not very desirable, but you want at least one in a raid and often will end up being the only one, so it is the fastest class to gear up in pugs
---
yea thats what i figured (youd be running sub), since you started this at 57. im full combat now so ill probably wait until 60 to start running this since i wont respec to sub until phase 2ish
---
*ha ha *
---
If those numbers are 10 yo, they are not right today. They have definitely upgraded most servers by now.
---
These days its not hard to have a server blacklist.
---
Something like [Grobbulus](https://www.reddit.com/r/Grobbulus/comments/da1eol/bad_interactions_reporting_eg_ninjalooting/)
---
225, gnomish is mostly trinkets and fun stuff. Goblins is mostly bombs and stuff that goes "boom".
---
What a tool.
---
Worst thing right now is just how many people know exactly where to go and exactly what to do. Demand is much higher than it ever could have been but I don't think the supply is that much worse.
---
Glad to see the horde scum be purged.
---
its very minor, since you have to drink after every pull anyways.
---
some jank where equipping a weapon will equip it in the offhand and then equip the shield. better to just use equipslot
---
With accounts getting banned who is buying this stuff.
---
Found the key on wowhead but am not sure which door this would open or how this would benefit me. Could you please elaborate?
---
they return non obtainable quest items if you pester.
---
gz on the vendor trash
---
I wasn't able to couple of days ago.
---
This justbsint true. Your transmute is worth 5-10 gold max on a two day cd. That's like 10 silver an hour. Just grinding random moves is worth way more than the time it would take to find someone in a city run to them and transmute. Your transmute should be used for the guild
---
Or you could've waited for your T2 belt which is the exact same except for stats and left MIC to mages...
---
lol at thinking youre gonna get a staff of shadowflame
---
The default UI is shit. Still the low-res 2006 (that's when I first started; didn't know addons existed...it was a dark time) elements.
---
..ffs, you **STILL** can't move the elements around natively; need an addon to do that.
---
BTW: Retail has OmniCC and Threat Meter built in, because Blizzard realized how fucking stupid it is to have a swish for 'cool down period'; it's half way...is that 6 seconds left? 12? 30? *let me mouse over to see the cd time, instead of just looking at the fucking icon with a number overlay counting down*. Threat...because *WHY THE FUCK DID ONY JUST TURN TOWARDS ME?! TANK HAS 2 SUNDERS ON HER! ((nevermind that I just landed two criticals on her))*
---
You can yeet yourself off any of the ramparts, or over the front gate. Regardless of where you jump it will drop you in the moat, so you can't aim for the bridge.

I hope someone brings this up at Blizzcon
---
I can't confirm if this is the case for all lower grenades. I've almost exclusively used Iron(~5-6 silver per grenade with excellent effect), Thorium(big brother of an iron grenade), and The Big Ones(expensive, but a 5 second stun in a huge area). I can confirm that all of them apply 2 incapacitate stacks.
---
IMO, there are still too many people, at least on my server. Having too many is great for many reason but it still sucks for resources and all of the competition for them. Arcane Crystals and Black Lotus are heavily contested all over with crazy high prices on the AH.
---
7-8 months for full T1 what are you on about? It's way less time, like less than half, unless you have some really unlucky drops. Like my wrath belt in vanilla that took 15 clears to actually see it drop.
---
I‚Äôve been maining a rogue since WotLK. Always loved the class and when making alts during new expansions, I ended up playing my rogue again at the end of the day. 
---
Hoever, I always had a weak spot for Druid, but it never truly clicked and didn‚Äôt get it max level. I wanted to change this in classic and immediately made a tauren Druid and got him to 40. In my lvl 30s I quickly made an orc warlock alt but left him at lvl 16 and continued on my druid. 
---
At 40, my will finally broke and I made my troll rogue (never played that race as a rogue and don‚Äôt care about minmaxing) and I‚Äôm loving the absence of mana, constant switching of forms to heal and the lack of 20+ essential macros. My rogue is level 25 atm.
---
However, I feel that I‚Äôm missing out on a lot by going for a pure dps class. I liked tanking dungeons on my druid for example, and I loved to have the ability to help and support my group, or strangers. 
---
I‚Äôm an extreme casual player, leveling slowly and enjoying the game. Because of this limited time I have I would prefer to focus on one character. I like (w)pvp and 5mans a lot, but more so, I like helping people, and love exploring and ‚Äòfucking around.‚Äô Going fishing in Dun Morogh as a hordie for example. I understand that while the Druid is the support class, it‚Äôs not that rogue ‚Äòcan‚Äôt help‚Äô people.
---
Maybe this is just a case of FOMO, and I‚Äôm just looking for advice on what to main looking at my interests, and for someone to shine some light on being max level on these characters! 
---
if you wanna make gold from skinning but dont wanna kill devilsaurs then kill some high lvl beasts which drop rugged leathers and just farm those. They will sell on AH but not overly well.
---
Saying that, as more and more people hit 60 and drop skinning leathers are becoming more valuable.
---
Noob queation: Will the auction house take the highest bid when I log off or just cancel itself and return to my mailbox?

If you don't want gnomish death ray or battle chicken, you can go straight for goblin and buy the other gnomish items on the AH.
---
Darf ich fragen, warum du auf diesem Server dann spielst, wenn RP nicht dein Ding ist?
---
Und wieso fandest du es zu weird dich darauf einzulassen? Geht es nicht darum auf einem RP-Server? 
---
Genau das war n√§mlich auch mein Eindruck gestern. Dass dort nicht jeder unbedingt Lust auf RP hat.
---
Ich schaue mir das heute nochmal an und bin gespannt wie meine RP-Abenteuer sich entwickeln :D
---
&gt;Are you one of the people who complains that you never get to play WoW anymore because of the old "ball and chain"? If not, my post doesn't apply to you. 
---
I am not. Although my wife does not enjoy video games she lets me do what I enjoy. It's real life responsibilities that often get in the way for me more often than not. 
---
&gt;It's the dumb boomer humor that's polluting this thread that I find sad. The whole "haha he got married so we'll never see him again boys" mentality. So many of these commenters have this idea that marriage is a burden that will change you for the worst and that's an ugly thing to comment on this person's post about their new marriage and their supportive guild.
---
I think you're over analyzing harmless jokes and taking them out of context. That's on you, not "dumb boomers". Btw I doubt almost anybody on this forum is a Boomer which begins at 55+.
---
Well, on these levels this extra leather shouldn't matter actually.

Icemail Jerkin goes for 15g on my server, don't feel too bad
---
They either don't care, or they literally don't understand some of the simplest mechanics of this game, such as aggro ranges, threat, teamwork and listening to instructions.
---
&gt;it would buff your OH white damage overall by 19%
---
Just from a straight math perspective without factoring in any other stats that's wrong. Going from 81 to 100 is almost a 24% increase
---
Nice story. People like that are worth holding on to! Sometimes it seems they are few and far between, but seems quite a few have made it back in time for Classic!
---
Congrats!
---
We've had some horde post screenshots like this from Mograine too.
---
wowheas guides lmao
---
being able to switch between characters means lots of rested exp, though - you could probably only level with rested exp after level 10.
---
Logging out has no effect on your auctions, they will last until the duration runs out.
---
you can blink while gouged too which is an incapacitate
---
Certain grenades say stun on the tooltip, even though they break from damage, not sure if they are considered a stun or incap.
---
I sold two assassins blades for 80g each and two night reavers for 25g each. I expect them to go up in prize, but so will crafting materials the close certain content patches come. 
---
Buying 80g worth of elemental earth now which will in turn increase in value 10-15x is worth more than assassins blade going from 80g to 160g later as probably like 30g will get sucked up by inflation anyways.
---
That's a great attitude imo. Using it to improve yourself, not just for trying to stay on top at the risk of a kill.
---
I get multiple in nearly every zone I enter.
---
&gt; The mistake and confidence i understand, the group leave right before the final boss? Wtf?
---
Retail player.
---
You can and should farm multiples of it for each raid for that reason. #1 reason why I'd love to be a bear tank but have already resigned myself to only tanking dungeons and healing raids come 60. Granted, you apparently only need 1 MCP charge per boss, but at 5 gnomeregan clears/hr with not even a 100% droprate on MCP, fuck that noise.
---
You seem to forget that people are mining iron like crazy for iron grenades in p2.
---
&gt;Thing is WoW takes a LOT of time. Like, I have maybe 2-3 hours of free time every day and I can't imagine having to choose between spending that time with my wife and spending that time on my hobbies. I have guildmates who play even more than me with spouses who don't play and I just don't understand it. Seeing your spouse once a week is batshit insane to me-- in theory this person is your favorite person on the planet.
---
Ok some nights you chill with your SO, some you play WOW. Life's all about balance, especially when you're an adult with limited free time and juggling work/school/kids/personal relationships/chores all while trying to fit in hobbies. Priorities are key.
---
Why do you wanna see this? It's a 20-40 second fight, everyone should use a restorative potion and Mages should do dmg. If they dispel instead of doing dmg, the fight lasts longer and that's bad for everyone :/
---
Zandalar tribe is great! Nice communities and a good mix of guilds too!
---
Mug 'o hurt. I'm a priest but one day I'm gonna duel my bro and when hes low health I'm gonna equip that mug and bonk him to death while "DOES IT HURT?"
---
The trick is to form a coalition with other guilds and pop heads exactly 6 hours before raid times.
---
these are a great money maker, I buy them from people for 5-8g and DE for 3-4 radiant shards that sell for 3g. Easy gold.
---
Pug mages have made me hate tanking, which is a shame, because I absolutely love my warrior. My original goal was to level up through dungeons via tanking - I bailed on that idea at 30.
---
Didn't the GM ninja the loot after he discovered the entire Officer community was corrupt and had formulated a plan to funnel gear to themselves and their friends?
---
Depends time of day for me. Around 4pm server time they get very frequent, especially if I chat in general
---
Alternatively, send a /tell to the spammer when you receive the invite.  Then right click their name from your message to them, and report.  Fuck em, they can spend another $15 and burn that account.
---
None of your concern how people play a videogame
---
Not sure where I said that. Are you assuming that because one knits and another games that they never spend any time together? Why is your view on these things that they are black and white and you either spend all of your time together or none of it? Just curious.
---
SPY just reads the combat log. There is absolutely nothing stopping you having a window outputting only enemy player action log lines to get the same effect. If a rogue is close enough for SPY to pick them up entering stealth you could have heard the stealth noise anyway. In fact people used to do things like changing the stealth noise to be louder.
---
I use spam because it's spam. But then I wonder if it should be cheating. So yah there should be a specific one
---
make robe of void and drop tailoring, go with herb+mining and enjoy Mara or even better DME
---
Tysm!

&gt;Everyone's gear is getting replaced in MC/Ony.
---
Crys in warlock shitty itemization.
---
As a happy amateur, doing my farming and using ah a lot, how does this work?
---
I've heard you can sell a level 60 for a few hundred.  Meh.
---
If there was a server that didn't allow addons, I would absolutely be playing on there.
---
Don't go there.  
---
Darkshore is the best 10-20 leveling zone for the Alliance.
---
No changes?
---
Well we need a new one!
---
I don't, we had 2 crafted tonight on our server telling everyone to have a party at IF forge. I kept on grinding my golds.
---
you'll run out of energy after three seconds.
---
A lot of players, it's one of the few still labaled as Layered because the peak is great. Pretty close A/H ratio, I think 54~% alliance and 46% horde. Seems like both sides have great RP community.
---
Hit me up @ Askyl (or TordFish or Nisroc if I'm on an alt) if you go Alliance =)
---
I'm sure they ban the accounts but you have to report them
---
Huh, that's interesting - completely slipped my mind. Perhaps I should get Engineering when I level up my alt, seems I need a refresher course on the subject. Cheers for your insights.
---
What about mages blinking to break out of grenade, as someone in the thread claims? That's something I don't recall happening either (as it should be an incapacitate effect), but as clearly evidenced, my memory is by no means flawless.
---
In the first video you linked I noticed the other mage blinking to avoid getting hit by a grenade in the first place - which is an evasive maneuver, very different from using Blink to break the CC.
---
ELI5 the first point please. If I miss 19% less with my offhand isn't that straight correlation to white damage whatever my stats aside from crit. IIRC crit is too annoying to calculate in such simplification but yeah it could be even mentioned. How does speed, damage or other stats affect the % increase of white damage?
---
On Whitemane and get maybe 1 a month lol.  Seems to be more when I'm in lowbie areas.  On my alt I get a few a week, but on my main...just two total from 1-60.
---
This is why I don't allow my wife to read.
---
I can see it being 10g or so, not sure how it measures up to other belts at its level.
---
Another highly upvoted thread of a tank complaining about dps. 
---
I have a different story. I‚Äôve stopped doing dungeons unless I have a tank from the guild with me because 9/10 tanks I‚Äôm grouped with can‚Äôt fucking pull without bribing more than one pack.
---
Hey, thanks for the reply. Does shatter proc on blizzard itself or am I proccing it with CoC after freezing? And I figured flamestrike + PoM instant flamestrike would be pretty decent for aoe if going for the arcane power build. 
---
I feel like you have a really good point regarding survivability, aggro resets and overall utility, thanks!
---
It really depends how you classify ‚Äòfree time.‚Äô For some people it would require shirking other responsibilities, friendships or hobbies.
---
/fart
---
Yes - can we have stream info here please. Rather tune into what sounds like a decent and honest stream than some of the mainstream streamers out there :)
---
??? they are the easiest cities to navigate
---
I've leveled up blacksmithing to 225, but I kind of regret it. I'd have preferred to have engineering instead. Would it be dumb or too much of a waste to change to engineering? I'm level 60.
---
I'm in the same boat, plus horde flight poins are just in better places and their fction cities are better.
---
I have been seeing this stacking meta more and more. Did we not know about this before? It seems like a great way to help the transition from phase 2
---
Because all it does is read the combat log that blizzard purposely added to the game. If Blizzard didn't want people to have that info, they wouldn't include it in the combat log that's turned on with every new character.
---
Not entirely true. The SPY addon allows you to auto detect enemy players. That gives the player using the addon a gigantic advantage over someone that doesn't use it.
---
I m not complaining I express my feelings about it. I used to play back in the day as MT.
---
I used some of them toi but now with more reflexion it feels like cheating for me and get the game easier that it was.
---
Fight as Vael where tanks were litteraly always looking on threat metter and not on the boss was a bit Sad.
---
That just my opinion. I just hope this kind of Addon starts to be mandatory to raid...
---
originally bwl came 2 weeks after honour patch, so i dont think there will be a long stretch of time between phase 2 and 3
---
It was especially bad last night.
---
*someone
---
Why is it not on master loot in the first place? Have one person in charge of that.
---
That helps, thanks man.  It was getting crazy.
---
Go ahead, blacksmithing is useless if you don't have super rare plans.
---
No it didn't it crashed all the time with big groups.
---
Honestly as long as people are camping their bots on qia's recipes, i will continue to greif them in any way possible.
---
You dont send your herbs to an alt? I do my routes and usually end up with 1 full bag of herbs then I just mail it to my herbing alt
---
I choose spam and then put the website they are spamming for in the comments box.
---
&gt;\~170 Black Lotus'
---
I think you've done your numbers wrong, I think you've calculated lotuses per zone per week?  I count 672 lotuses if one is picked every hour in the 4 zones for a week.
---
I don't join and report every one.
---
Is there anybody that's *not* farming gold and mats for consumables in end game?
---
Maybe he already had it.
---
Nope that's how you get ninja'd. Always NEED on good items and tell the group to NEED on it as well. St0rmD is right here.
---
If you hate the content, think its unoriginal ad unbearable, that's your right. Not going to argue with it.
---
All I ask is that you read the post, and then tell me how much it sucked. Then I can take your criticism seriously. Until then, your post has no meaning.
---
banken means bank ?   
---
then bog means gay ?  
---
bog is god in russian... so ....
---
You can just send them a whisper, then right click and report off of that. I like to whisper them to free Hong Kong then report them ;)
---
&gt; People who are selling gold are the same people who are pulling the strings in AH.
---
I highly doubt that. Look at the top earners on /r/woweconomy, most of them still don't make nearly gold an hour to even cover a single token on retail, i assume this pattern is the same in Classic.
---
&gt;Once they give away enough gold they will increase AH prices, making the 1,000 worth less and less.
---
I think the value of gold to USD will be pretty steady from here on out, only depending on demand and not supply. All the top gold MAKING strategies of the game are there now, and it is probably capped at around 50-70g/h.
---
No, blizzard can't crit and therefore can't proc shatter.
---
It's not the best idea, because flamestrike costs 990 mana, or 1287 with arcane power.. That's almost 2600 mana for 2 flamestrikes... And those 2 flamestrikes won't even deal that much damage, because they will not crit as you don't have any shatter points.
---
The best way to shatter a frost nova vs a bunch of mobs is Flamestrike+Cone of Cold, followed by arcane explosion spam. This is for max damage output in a group. Sometimes, I skip the flamestrike and just do Cone of Cold into Arcane Explosion spam. If you have salvation, it's possible to do double the damage of everyone else without even taking the aggro. (40% threat reduction from arcane subtlety + 30% threat reduction from salvation, which I believe equals to 58% threat reduction: 0.7*0.6 = 0.42)
---
[For low levels, no. For higher levels... maybe.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aPRHdLWkURv6EZ9yjHUApY9hDw4IJbJ6/view)
---
Personally I don't think Imp DS is ever worth the hassle that Drain Soul (the actual spell) causes. It lowers your dps (causing you to take more damage and get less kills/min), is hard to interrupt wanding for, and resets your five second rule. 
---
Regeneration through drain life, dark pact, and life tap combined with liberal  bandaging is much more fluid and efficient. This is particularly true because warlocks scale the most weakly with spirit, but spell power increases our efficiency in every way possible.
---
Why isn't your raid just entirely warriors and rogues?
---
pretty sure something similar happened to me too, only really remembered it once I read this haha
---
First time wow player. Got my human rogue to 60 and started raiding 3 weeks ago. Dont like raiding as rogue because I dont feel like I contribute anything and there are 10 other rogues in raid that look the exact same as me. I also have tried some pvp and I just feel like rogues abilities do not feel smooth, kinda clunky. 
---
So I want to make a new character really bad. Ideally I would want to play something that has some uniqueness in pve/raiding while being able to do damage in pvp without having to respec constantly. Anything like this exist? 
---
I have been looking at shadow priest and paladin. Shadow priest is unique and caster dps which is different that rogue and I can res people among other helpful things while being a badass in pvp. But with pally I really like the way the raid armor sets look, I can be really useful and from what I have seen so far pretty unique in raids, but I'm not sure if I would like pvp healing would rather be able to do a lot of damage in pvp. Any opinions, or is there something better I should look at?
---
Well go ahead you've built it up. What's your server and ally or horde?
---
Boots, shoulders, and effectively back and bracers all green. Best back is a of shadow wrath dungeon drop blue with mp5 but next best option is a green of shadow wrath that just lacks the mp5. Same thing with bracers, except fire resistance instead of mp5. Oh and excluding t2 helm a green of shadow wrath is the next best option for our head
---
12 years is a long time to spend in the tutorials, welcome to the game, now the real fun begins!
---
Mostly the other replier is correct, but you can still take totemic mastery as ele and enh, and it‚Äôs usually the best talent choice. Only thing is now the totems don‚Äôt effect the whole party anymore, just the sham. It is stupid and watered down as hell though.
---
Yes that was the official story he gave and also made sure all counter evidence were conveniently deleted (nuked the discord). Turns out, it all happened in his head and the stuff he showed were crafted from A to Z
---
So you don't actually *need* the gold? You're just greedy when it comes to high amounts of gold. Got it.
---
The biggest issue is that you have to treat the regen like a recovery period and avoid casting while it is active.  Lifetapping and drain life will serve you better than relying on spirit.
---
They would just deny the claims and request proof. If proof isn't shown then it would be likely just as damaging to the other person.
---
The Barrens will know!
---
rolling a warrior was a mistake.  why didnt I roll the money printe--I mean Mage class.
---
If you can do that it's bugged and not working as intended, I recall mages blinking my CS or KS but not Gouge (although it's been 14-15 years, mind you). Also supported by this quote below, from [here](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Incapacitate): 
---
"Incapacitate effects are also often harder to break free from; a [mage](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Mage) can for example break a stun by using [Blink](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Blink), but **will be unable to do so if incapacitated**. "
---
There is a limit to how many debuffs can be on a target at once, if you add a new debuff and go over the limit, a debuff gets removed from the target, which could well be someones high damage dot
---
He's describing a larger economic process of inflation in WoW where increase in money supply (gold) leads to decrease in value of said money (1 gold is worth less), so to buy the same product on the AH after inflation then the 'same price' will be more gold than before due to this inflation
---
How does honourless work? Can I not slow/stun you for 17 seconds with my gank squad?
---
&gt;Gold sellers typically only use hacked accounts. There's just no money in farming gold en-masse, despite the name
---
Are you sure about that? I can't remember the last time i've heard of someone being hacked in WoW. I think most gold come from bots now or actual gold they buy and resell. At least, i've seen a few websites where they buy gold with the purpose of selling it at a higher price.
---
Bugged how? I did it with 10 people and everything worked fine. The one I can't seem to do after 4 attempts is that damn In Dreams quest
---
Was herbalist/alch. Dropped herbalism yesterday, made bis chest in one day, now deciding should I go back to herb to farm dm or something else
---
same!
---
Lasher farm and satyrs is not even better than ZF. Zf you get to 50g/hr, neither dm east nor brd can compete. I tried everything (and am herb)

What is the minimum level to zone into RFC?
---
He's just a terribad rogue mad that the player at 50% health fighting two mobs got notified he entered stealth to try and backstab them.
---
That's weird. We had a raid on gurubashi with about 60 Horde and a bunch of Alliance. No lag at all.
---
Your right that Blizzard are currently facilitating such addons, but again, that doesn't mean unintended uses aren't bad for the game.
---
From a casual point I would think that Druid is excellent because you can do so much on your own. You can tank/dps/heal and are able to solo situations that others couldn't. You can stealth like a Rogue and play with the same resource, Energy, like a Rogue. And on top of that you can just heal yourself up easily afterwards and continue withouth much (any) downtime.   
---
You can help very well since you are able to fill every roll, in dungeons and while questing. (W)PvP is probably the only thing where it is different, because here it takes a lot to master a Druid since your toolkit is so huge and using it efficiently takes practice. I've watched some Druid PvP videos from private servers and it is insane to see how a real good player makes use of the Druids various forms and abilities. 
---
Maxlevel PvE will see you mainly as a healer, especially if you plan to raid. If you are mostly doing 5 mans you can be healer or tank, just feral DPS is rarely seen.   
---
I am currently leveling an alt Shaman and have to say, that it is a lot of tun. Your tookit is ranged DPS and melee DPS, you are quite agile, you buff with totems, heal yourself and others and Ghost Wolf at level 20 is such a sweet way of increasing leveling speed. Yes it uses mana, yes you need to regen that once in a while, but all in all it is a very unique class with a lot of playstyles and possibilities. At 60 you are a healer in 99% of the cases.
---
if it can fly, it can glide down the ledge, trust me,

Rename your pet Leroy Jenkins :p

Just wait till phase two. People are going to have nothing else to do than harass the other faction.
---
Anyone know how to get enemy cast under their icon up in the left corner like in this video at 7:10? https://youtu.be/c48edx8yUIM 
---
(Sorry for not linking timestamp I‚Äôm on mobile and don‚Äôt know how)
---
But Darkshore is 20 - 30 lvl zone
---
Especially the first time around, 40-50 had some real shit zones leveling wise. Badlands really sticks out in my brain being over crowded and relatively sparse on quests. (Alliance) there were a couple zones like that, but they might be better now that the game has settled down.
---
Dude thank you
---
Do you have 6 pieces of shadowcraft?
---
I plan on picking up Engineering after I get my epic mount.
---
Thank you, it was getting annoying on the Spanish server, 2-3 invites per day.
---
It incapacitates instead you instead of stunning. The tooltip is misleading but orc racials don‚Äôt help here
---
The simple answer is no.
---
I play troll indeed
---
Yikes.
---
No you can't.
---
Ran into a warlock that need rolled on a leatherworking pattern the other day.  I commented, "Whoa, a leatherworking Warlock, never seen that before."
---
He DC'd out like a few seconds later.  I thought to myself, "Welcome back to Classic." lol
---
Please no one is saying that WoW Classic is dead.  It has a higher population than Retail.  Retail is dead, if anything.
---
Threat meter reading is hard.
---
I -think- he's wrong. I don't remember ever being able to blink out of a grenade. Unfortunately, despite frequent encounters with the hordes, I haven't had many grenades thrown at me yet, so I don't have any 100% proof. I'm playing on a RP-PVP server and there aren't that many engineers around, it would seem(those noobs!).
---
Check your binds for alt v and alt c, for some reason my mouse buttons also bound those keys (only 2 additional buttons on my mouse so maybe it's a different alt+combo).
---
Doing the Lord's work right here.
---
When we arrived, there were elite mobs already spawned. We were killing them and they just kept respawning and nothing else happened. No friendly NPCs spawned.
---
Went on honeymoon and now I have to earn my raidspot. Which means 4 weeks of earning my spot before I'm considered a raider, I accumulate dkp, but Everytime I bid it's considered low priority and a designated raider can spend next to nothing in dkp and just get the piece..... Wouldn't be upset if I literally didn't have an important life event put me like 6 weeks behind 10 other mages....even though prior to leaving I basically was full pre-bis except the damn briar root and necklace that I've spent 20 or so sessions in each dungeon to get.
---
It's quite easy. Once you leave the "castle area" and are on the road going to the tower, just stop assisting him.  
---
Stay about 30y away and let him die. I've done this multiple times, helping him broke the quest so you just gotta watch the show, grab popcorn or soemthing
---
It's really relaxing though. A bit like fishing.
---
And sometimes you even get a little excitement like a polymorph or a decurse.
---
the Streisand effect
---
Worked for us last night. Make sure whoever lays the bundle stays near the Town square after fighting corrupted redpath.
---
No its 100% not up for discussion a stun as proven by the games mechanics.   A mage can blink it off.
---
or hunter lol
---
If you just dinged 60 you will want to bring a DPS along.
---
What if you miss Nigerian prince in WoW offer? :(
---
It is wrong.  You should eject HIM not dump the other three people who now regard you as likely to quit.
---
You gotta send them free speech messages back or something that reminds of tian anmen, that will trigger The Great Firewall
---
What does tldr mean
---
You will. But Blizzard does this in ban waves. So you will hear about it in 6 months or so. Pisses me off a lot.
---
 VW cant keep threat very well in classic. On some private servers his damage and threat was overtuned
---
Most people will use succubus
---
I think the talent isnt that usefull. When you get a good drain lvl 34 or 38 you will not wand much and since you cast drain it will stopp regen
---
I would go draintank and get dark pact, then respec at lvl 60
---
Yes that too
---
Directly on the SSD or on the Monitor?
---
You're welcome babe! I enjoy it a lot as well.

We have a buddy that‚Äôs a 60 feral Druid we can bring. I‚Äôll find videos. Thanks all.

&gt; Barely any RP
---
I see RP on a daily basis on ZT. Just because you haven't seen it or aren't involved in it, does not mean that he is lying. I'm not really sure why you took such offence to his statement.
---
My guess would be engineer stuff, like stun nades ann it's mats.
---
Honestly, i feel sorry for you. A language we all ostensibly love and you don't know  the definition of solo. Flinging turds at someone just trying to celebrate your missed vocabulary moment. Good for you "bro"

warcraftlogs
---
Seems wayyy to complicated of a trick. Much more likely of an horde ganking those who are pvp enabled. Rez, buff and healing does that.
---
Free VD for every patron.
---
I'd actually be interested in a breakdown of your raid carry items.  How much is gear, pots, food/buff items.  Can't help but feel you cld get by with less rn xD
---
That's not really an issue in dungeons. I'm raids, sure, but not from WC to BRD.
---
Take a screenshot, you fucking caveperson

Anyone having trouble logging in?

warris are not that much of a problem right now.

Still waiting for faps to reach 12-15g a stack still only 5-6g on my server, i have like 400x atm but dont want to stock to much
---
The gap between Phase 2 and Phase 3 is going to be hell. The most efficient way to gain honor will be camping people who afk on flight paths.  For me, that's going to get really boring, for those of you who rolled PvP Servers because your friends made you, I feel the worst for.
---
One of the best servers I have played on. The community is great. There is frequent RP and RP events if you know where to luck. There is always some form of PVP going on. Overall, it's proven to be a great server so far.
---
Just drain tank once you hit 35- 40
---
Look up a guide on YouTube. I did the switch after running affliction for leveling and drain tanking is way better and more fun. My survivability is much better now
---
They were all in the same guild.  They were not going to kick their own.
---
super odd design choice to actively step away from such features
---
Nothing to see here, just a Wednesday.
---
I think it will go up even more in p3 when ppl start premading
---
2 mageblades , 1 perdition, 1 brutality , 1 bre , 1 spinal so far here
---
ok a lot of people have told me this, and it's great that it worked for them but
---
1) My first time the disguise ran out mid-quest because I had to wait for him to respawn, so now I log out in the room and check back to try to catch him as he respawns
---
2) Second and third time I followed this advice and both times some random pack of mobs walked by the tower and killed him before he was supposed to die. The second time I tried helping when he was about to die, but before the scripted event (so my 3rd attempt with the quest), and he still died and quest failed. 
---
3) My 4th and final attempt was a party of 5. The 4 other people in the group passed and mine failed for no fucking reason
---
I'm not trying that shit again it's just too frustrating
---
Thank youuuuuuuuu
---
I get being burnt out, however at 47 you're only a few levels away from being able to start doing end game dungeons to start gathering prebis gear and thats when the game got really fun for me as my warrior. 
---
Druid is always a solid choice since you can realistically do all 3 rolls as HOTW/Resto build. while still being good at pvp as well, there's just always options to keep yourself busy. plus they get extra movement speed early so it makes leveling that much faster post 20/30.
---
I'm really enjoying leveling a warlock right now as well. I just hit 20 but I don't see myself slowing down anytime soon. There's a ton of different leveling specs you can go utilizing all of your different pets and the utility is really high with summons and soul stones/health stones. The ability to solo pretty much every quest in the game is useful as well.
---
Most of us are Orcs with a few taurens and a troll. No Deathbringer drops in 7 weeks either. And its not just for PvE, we have some 2h Fury warriors with us too, since 1h are going to be highly fought over.
---
Gold sellers aren't welcomed here.
---
Engineering will always benefit you more now than alc, alch will get nicer as the game progresses though.
---
Sadly, that would deduct \~0.5% of the total profit, so can't have that!
---
...gotta make *all* of the money!
---
An upgrade is an upgrade, and if it's not "reserved" beforehand you can roll. Now it'd be different if you were rolling for "off spec" gear. It would be mighty tempting as a Paladin to roll on HOJ if you were healing. But rules are rules. If you're there to  heal, you roll on healing gear. Those items will still be there for people to grind out.
---
There's an addon that does this plus block the person and auto reports them it's called Gold Seller blocker on curse.it even sends then a message in case you want to talk shit!
---
yat?
---
Oh damn it, I thought it was an actual ring... &gt;&lt;
---
Hmm, that seems really high, I just checked my server out of interest and 1000g is ¬£130 ($167).
---
Typical gold farming rates for a 60 who knows what they are doing is around 50g per hour, so 1000g is 20 hours of work. 20 hours of work for $167 is $8.35 per hour, which is barely over minimum wage. I doubt the sites actually pay the farmers anywhere close to that, but that's another matter...
---
Alrighty, this was my go-to memory as well, from those ancient days of yore. 
---
Granted I only did BGs for fun back then and never tried to push for any high PvP ranks, there seems to be a LOT more Engineers about today than back then - but on the other hand, with bustling forums, streams and other sources being much more alive and prevalent today, it might just be that I never saw much mention of them then. Started browsing through Engi recipes for fun after you linked the Goblin mortar, and it does look like a lot of fun - I just might pick it up and try to confirm these things myself as well :)
---
How does the tribute chest in DM N work? 
---
Do certain ogres need to be alive for certain loot to appear or does the ogre count matter for quality/quantity of items?
---
that's gotta feel good!
---
I only saw both drop once, and one person in the run was there for the mainhand and one was there for the offhand. Nobody else rolled so those 2 got exactly what they came for!
---
me too. I think it would be a complete different experience in PVE as in PVP.
---
Gz my dude that is really lucky! I got both in like 3h and still felt super lucky.
---
Very true, I also like grouping exclusively with casters to yoink the warrior gear anyways so we do tend to drink in unison a lot.
---
Gray items aren't master loot.
---
I had the same reason for leaving it open as the poster above. Now that I know this, I‚Äôll gladly block all incoming invites. I‚Äôve been reporting them under ‚Äúspamming.‚Äù
---
Must be Moonguard's Goldshire. ;P
---
Eh its helpful for guilds go find players that are slacking. Will be more helpful when raids get harder.
---
You can buy wrapping paper from pretty much any general goods vendor.
---
Yeah well the thing is, the account doing the advertising that you are reporting will never have anything on it. So all they lose by that is the one month sub. Now if you went ahead to the website, ordered gold and then reported ingame the player who would be giving it to you, now that could do something :D
---
So it's a stun effect for the purposes of resistances and abilities that can be used, but otherwise acts like an incapacitate effect as far as breaking on damage?

"Hey, you! You're finally awake!"
---
Ah! An absolutely lovely comment with zero knowledge, sourcing or proof.
---
Would you please go and find a video on youtube proving you wrong from classic duels? 
---
Such as a grenade applying 2 stacks of an incapacitation effect instead of a stun, being breakable by damage(requires 2 damage hits)(not a stun), and not being blinkable(again, not a stun)
---
We did purge them indeed... and on both layer at that!
---
You mean, in case we don't want to actually buy any gold?
---
You can also do this to save on repair costs if you‚Äôre about to die anyways!
---
Well yes and no lol.
---
As a Warrior I very rarely get "revenge" or anything.  I've been camped relentlessly from situations just like this (peace pact made with 1-2 ally, then a third shows up and all of them murder me relentlessly).  A stealth using class can more easily snipe off some revenge shots, but not every class can tango.  Most times world pvp has been aggravating lol.
---
I think it‚Äôs both, they use hacked accounts to bot, I remember once landing in a phase of like 30 trial character balance druids farming the same strip of mobs in pandaria endlessly. It was surreal
---
They actually added this in one of the first updates because this gold selling method became common.
---
I passed the only set of true strikes I‚Äôve seen to our rogue.  I‚Äôm now 35 runs in afterwards.  Why did I have to be a nice guy lol.

Ever notice how everyone on WoW is suspiciously married or refers to their SO as ‚Äúthe wife‚Äù?
---
You surely mean *your* default behavior. This one is very different among demographics and player types.
---
The right answer is to be mindful of what others choose and to go with the flow.
---
Thank you for this

I agree here, it is vastly more convenient for many people to just use their phone, but, with that said, the least you can do is line it up so the picture isnt angled and *looks* like a clip of a screenshot.
---
Do you wait for everybody to be 100% mana before you pull? I don‚Äôt and I‚Äôve never had that issue. You can pull when they are like 50% and still drinking, they will join in when they can and if you are geared and specced properly you should survive long enough for them to come heal you.

Master looter is only concerned with green items and up. Until the random person whose turn it is to loot the core hound looks at the garbage it dropped, or at its empty loot table, there's nothing anyone else can do.

I don‚Äòt. I get the notification in chat, but can‚Äôt click on it. I guess pray blocks that.

I think you can actually turn those off as well in the filter settings in the chat log.  There‚Äôs a tab for the main channels but also an ‚Äúother‚Äù tab that has a filter for channel. I thought it might just filter out all channels but general chat still worked with it unchecked so maybe that will filter just those invite channels.
---
berechtigte Frage haha. Bins wohl gewohnt hier in Englisch zu schreiben.
---
Mind = blown. In every guild I've been in on both retail and classic, Warlocks were always the ones to show up late the most.
---
I'll pour a glass of scotch if I'm solo'ing or in a non-tank position for a dungeon/raid.  Never when I tank though, as I want to be sharp.

Though it might not be much consolation, PUG raids (often filled from multiple guilds) seem to be semi-common on my server, both on raid day and a couple of days after including weekends.
---
No one asked for this lmo
---
&gt;As far as pvp goes, I have a /wave macro.  That accounts for 95% of world pvp that I've encountered so far.  The other 5% being ganking.
---
Exactly what I expected from someone to made such comment. 
---
Why even bother playing a PvP server?

I'd rather get WeakAuras and use a template from wago.io for an energy timer.

There is another shrine to a fallen dev just south of the dwarven area in Hillsbrad, right on the cliff edge.  They definitely honor their own.

\- Find two professions that you think you will enjoy and benefit the most from. And lvl them up while you are lvling, sometimes its just a nice break from questing, also you will benefit from it in the long run and in the endgame.   
---
\- Get some decent bags as fast as you can. You will acquire alot of junk from mobs and also quest items, little bag space will not only lose you money in the long run, but will also become annoying as you have to throw out items you would have sold. (Vendorprice is a good addon to see the value of your items)  
---
\- Find a guild that suits you and become friends with your guildmates. Ive learned that the most important thing in WOW is having a good guild, no matter what you do, if its PVE, PVP, RP, Lvling.  
---
\- V/Q/E/F/G are good replacements for the 6/7/8/9/0 keybinds. Using only numbered keybinds feels abit clunky and when u get better at using some of the lettered keybinds you will feel "better" in the sense of having more control of how you play and give you more of a flow.  
---
\- Questing and lvling. If you want it Questie is a nice addon to show you where you can quest, where to do those quests and where to turn in those quests. But you have to find out if you want that or to just explore and know nothing about the world. And if you ever feel stuck, Wowhead will always help you. Comment sections on specific quests have helped me out alot.   
---
\- Addons, get the Twitch app for you computer. Easy to find addons if you want them and easy to update them.   
---
\- Be social

&gt;threat only resets for whoever has the lowest threat while eating a fireball
---
I'm not sure that's exactly how it works. When my group did it, we had two tanks stack (1st and 2nd on threat table), they got all the fireballs, and it was the 2nd place tank who had aggro after she landed. I'm trying to think of one mechanic that reconciles all these strats working but I'm coming up blank.
---
Well done. Waiting anxiously for the screenshot with all 60s.
---
It matters because it's gold for the guild. P3/4/5/6 are expensive and we are buying stuff for further phases already.
---
and the note of "gold selling"
---
I don't think that's true. I mean I'm sure that does happen, but as soon as the person whose account was hacked reports it to Blizzard they would just trace the gold and remove it from the person who bought it, possibly even ban them. If this happens enough then people would just stop using that particular gold buying service. 
---
There IS money for them to make on farmed gold, but these sites don't farm it themselves, they likely just buy it from people with too much time on their hands and no platform to sell it themselves. I imagine this is way more common in Asia. Typical gold farming rates for a 60 who knows what they are doing is around 50g per hour, so 1000g is 20 hours of work. 20 hours of work at $167 is $8.35 per hour, so as long as the sites are buying it from the farmers for less than that then they're making a profit on the sale.
---
What's your offhand in that screenie?
---
Good video.

GL finding a raid guild. Being prepared for the encounter and knowing where you stand threat wise are integral parts of successfully raiding. Probably not the usual case but DBM is required by my guild if you want to raid. Wouldn‚Äôt want to wipe and waste 39 other players time because your opposed to gathering necessary info. UI is just choice and aesthetics but DMB is amazing and you can customize it so it‚Äôs less intrusive
---
Right. This was staged for karma.
---
nah I still see the spammers message
---
Ok, thanks for the feedback. I was just curious if I may have been missing anything in how the commands work in order to achieve a sign-up and poll. I'll be able to manage around it.
---
Again thanks for getting this Bot built. I've been doing some searching and this definitely looks like one of the better ones I've seen.
---
You say that but Spy is arguably game-breaking to some degree and even though I use it I'd support them breaking it. 
---
I don't know how they would though because all it does it read things like the combat log and give alerts based on that. It doesn't access any information not already freely available, it just vastly streamlines it.
---
\&gt;unpopular opinion
---
\&gt;90% agree
---
The real MVP
---
Since smithing is essentially useless and engineering is by far the best for both pve an pvp, sure go for it
---
You can perform a blink gouge while you get gouged after the blink.
---
you can't remove a gouge with a blink.
---
This fixed the problem in my own case of OP's issue. Started a warrior, then a rogue, then a mage and I fell into this slump between lv20-30, then rolled druid. hoping the endgame doesnt set off that feeling again.
---
Odds are that kid doesn‚Äôt either.
---
My OCD wants the red shirt to be horde and the white one to be alliance...
---
I cannot imagine only using 1-9 for spells, I have at least triple that bind to all the surrounding buttons plus shift modifiers and I still run out of keys.
---
I always rationalized these kind of things as they want pristine body parts, and we are just clumsily hacking away or having trouble finding parts that arent already damaged. Items like the one in OP's post seem to back up that possibility.
---
Understanding of hour to make money from vendoring has inflated the market so much more than in Vanilla.
---
i know what this is about, we can go get the key later
---
At this point it's a fact and nothing close to 'Reee!'
---
Is buying gold against TOS? Or just selling? Because if the former, this is bad advice.
---
Non orc/non human you want at least 9% hit so that your yellow attacks can‚Äôt miss
---
That‚Äôs exactly what I do too. I report like two to three a day. They just keep popping up!
---
Logging out doesn‚Äôt matter
---
For me when things get more difficult things have to me more difficult. It is like in every kind of game. You just adapt or get better getting the information that you can get and react faster to the raid interractions. 
---
Again that prove my point if you have to use add on to keep rainding. That's against the game. 
---
I hope we will not have to.
---
What you are seeing is the fact nades‚Äô only stun for a short duration, and when spamming blink it looks like they get out of it early
---
I had this issue on a nvme SSD lol
---
Lol, in the end it ended up costing you money.
---
I've just been throwing all blues/purples on my bank alt to sell at some future time when people are actually buying that stuff for alts.
---
Not gonna lie, I think most of that post consists of valid but disagreeable points, even with this in mind. You would have to believe that increasing the number of servers would have somehow avoided the concept of Nost-like ‚Äúmega hubs‚Äù like Gehennas.
---
&gt; I wouldn't be surprised if they bump that timeline like they did Dire Maul.
---
Difference is that DM was out on launch in Europe. It wasn't necessarily intended to be a "later phase" thing
---
if he agrees. pm me his twitch. id like to support him too.
---
They're talking about reddit gold, not WoW gold. 
---
You missed the joke
---
I was level 42, we had 7 guildies' alts in tow and I *still* managed to wipe us two and a half times.

The bitching about it on Reddit is the 'Reee!' especially when you're subscribed.

Dude I started late.

A couple weeks ago my friends and I formed a group with two randos to do RFC. It was a tank and a hunter. The tank was using a shitty staff and the hunter didn't have a pet. We promptly abandoned group after wiping and re-rolled in a different server LOL
---
how... How do you even know that? Im tired of people repeating weird information. How do you know what blizard did or didnt do with the loot tables?
---
Greedy people will never understand.

I mean if they are taking agro but also melting stuff then I've no issue keeping them up if I can.

No one ASKED for op's post either, why does it matter. Hes leveling characters on a pvp server that has no reward system for pvp yet. 90%of all interactions xfaction are /nod or wave
---
Gz, yesterday I did it 1st time, lost the roll on Drakkisath belt to another warr but I won Doomsaw with a greed roll. Guess I can go roleplay Leroy next time
---
It doesn't matter if a random person in the group can use it. Being able to use it doesn't mean that a person actually WILL use it... Everyone needing is the only fair way if you are playing with strangers.
---
no one even knew batching existed before blizzard introduced it. please source this claim that the community requested it
---
I will say that people were very glad to see it initially, but they also didn't play on it yet.
---
Also this is irrelevant to the server churn that occurs during large scale pvp where you are not operating on .4s batches but 8-12 second batching periods
---
Did you keep a spreadsheet to keep track of the prices?
---
It annoys me way more than it should that it still shows me the notification. I've never in my life cared about a chat channel that I was invited to. Any chat channel that I've ever joined has been by typing /join.

Go deep resto, like get imp ghost wolf then full resto. Chug greater mana pots, they are cheap and if you use em on CD you'll be drinking far less and able to keep the raid moving while others drink. Dont be afraid to use LHW it's a mana waste but most bosses dont require 100% of your mana. Use max rank when able, you skipped the mana tide totem but are sacrificing raw healing power to conserve mana? Use the highest rank you think isnt going to overheal and learn what fights you need mana tide/ mana pots to sustain,  r1 chain healing should be just to top the raid off when no one needs immediate attention.
---
I don't need proof I don't care if you think a mage can't blink it you can easily find a mage and test it and see I'm right.  I'm at work Im not lookin through videos of classic duels to find a mage blinking a grenade LOL.  Walk into durotar and find a mage
---
It depends on a lot of factors, so it's hard to give you firm time estimates. Is your group all 60? How competent are you? A competent tank and healer can speed a group up, but only if the dps are competent enough to take advantage of it. What classes do you have? Dps warriors and rogues can burn down bosses really fast, while mages and warlocks can speed up trash considerably.
---
I've had a full clear of BRD take over 5 hours. I've also had it take less than 2 hours. I've had UBRS take over 2 hours, I've had it take 45 min. 
---
So unfortunately, there is no clear answer for your question. If I were you, I'd budget at least 2, if not 3 hours for a dungeon, and be pleasantly surprised if it takes less time.
---
thank you sooo much for this. Can't wait to get home and tickt that box. Fuckin gold sellers...

Mages can NOT blink out of grenade stun.

Perhaps this might be the anecdotal experience the guy reported, but it still sounds weird. 
---
Short? Some last for 3 seconds, no? That doesn't feel short at all, and anyone PvPing should be able to tell whether they were able to Blink out of it after .5-1 sec or after 2.8 sec.
---
Once a week somehow this checkbox umchecks itself on my client. Not sure if its from an addon or my config folder being janky. I notice it right away when a spammer hits me with some bullshit

They‚Äôre actually much easier to navigate than UC and Org if you spend a little time there. I understand where you‚Äôre coming from as a newly rolled Alliance player, but I got the hang of both cities after a week or so of playing.  Orgrimmar has annoying levels and UC is just annoying af with the bands, bridges, and levels
---
It is though, in the "a little too real for me" category.
---
Ah I just noticed I forgot to colour in his ... face dot ... things.
---
Serves me right for trying to race out a meme after 3 dungeon runs on a school night.
---
I actually want that, because I use a macro on my mouse wheel scroll up to pet attack and scroll down for pet return. When my pet kills someone he instantly is running back to me (often with dash still active).
---
So even if I'm pretty quick changing to the next target I often loose a few seconds of pet dps that I wouldn't if my pet was on defensive. If you switch your pet to passive and just manually give him each attack, my understanding is he'll stop doing the wait around thing
---
They are bots, thats why lol
---
Orly? Only retail mentality huh.
---
And what's that you were saying about people being oversensitive again?
---
it is i believe. trick is that you would not accept the gold, just report the player :D

It's impossible to have a counter-argument since you started talking about stuff that wasn't discussed. Why would I counter argue something that's true?
---
You insult your self in your mind, nothing I said was an insult.
---
Ur a warrior? He's a holy priest. As a resto druid leveling 85% of my time has been in groups. 
---
My advice: Make friends along the way, after a good run, add your party as friends on character friends list, let them know you did and more often then not, you'll see them again, especially if they need a good healer. By the time you hit 60 you have all of these great people on ur friends list, probably some all in the same guild, ask 1 of them if you can join the guild, gear BiS with all your new friends and guildies, find a raid spot, kill rag
---
I'm sure they do too, because that's another game license and subscriptoin fee they get when the gold sellers set up new accounts (or the original owners of the hacked accounts do, however they do it).
---
I went back to see how retail compares today in a dungeon... well we wiped as the healer was healing themselves and not anyone else.
---
You can't.

I do as well. I suppose I'll go as far as I can without it. I won't hold my raid group back, but if I can raid without it, I'd prefer to.
---
From the affliction tree the only talents that actually help your raid effectiveness is life tap and shadow mastery, the other 23 points are essentially filler that you can place how you want.  There are some that are useful in dungeons, and some that are more useful for solo pve/pvp.  
---
So personally I would suggest you go ‚Äúfull pvp‚Äù because your raiding ability will be uneffected and 5man content is too easy to matter
---

---
I'm just trying to get my main to 60 before this happens but I'm such a slow leveler
---
Had to download Opie and necrosis because 36 hot keys just didn't cut it for warlock.
---
The amount of pop-up windows people click "OK" on without even reading is astounding. Not even in game, but in computer use altogether.
---
Bouncing between classes and it‚Äôs driving me nuts. I want to raid and pvp at 60, but I‚Äôm basically leveling up three characters at the same time since I can‚Äôt make up my mind.
---
Level 41 - undead mage
---
Level 53 - undead rogue
---
Level 16 - undead warlock
---
Solo pvp is important for me and all three of these classes have great potential for that.
---
I think the cool down reliance of the rogue is a bit of a turn off for me. For the mage, I love the class (main in vanilla) but I straight up can‚Äôt make up my mind on if I want to go pure single target frost or an aoe build. 
---
For the lock, Im stuck for the dumbest reason. I enjoy having the pet options and different ways to dps, but as a Horde player, I‚Äôm so torn between rolling UD or Orc. The stun resist racial is so strong, especially for locks I believe, but I‚Äôve always been a Undead race dude. But just knowing the option is there for Lock, and it‚Äôs a very strong one, bothers me while I‚Äôm leveling up my Undead lock.
---
Long ass post, thanks for reading.
---
3 seconds is still only 2 globals. 
---
I have seen some mages pull some BS before but fact of matter is blink should not break a nade stun
---
Wait so you can go into a dungeon with a 10 man raid?
---
Took up engineering early and realized it wasnt as gold lucrative as I hoped, then switched to skinning
---
I think you missed the joke of the missed joke
---
I am leveling slowly. Have a level 50 priest now. I think he might ding 60 in a month or two. 
---
Will people still run the entry dungeons such as BRD in 3, 6 or 12 months? I fear missing out on certain content, but really don't have time to speed up the process :-). I don't mind missing certain raids honestly, mostly focusing on dungeons for now.
---
Also, when I finally have my pre-raid BIS-gear (maybe in 6 months?); will it not be obselete with new phases and content? Or does pre-raid BIS-gear not really change that much?
---
Yes yes yes
---
Shaman leveling be like:
---
I am a healer... or am I a tank? Perhaps a melee DPS? Caster DPS?
---
Playing Shaman and managing gear in bank-loot-vendor-AH is like being schizophrenic, and never knowing what you want to sell and what you want to keep.
---
30/0/21 resto shaman. Amazing burst for pvp and great raid healing with t2.
---
But as more gold gets injected into the economy it has to cause inflation. Not to mention the demand is high right now because people still need their epic mounts and many craftables are still BiS.
---
I'm going to go on the assumption then that what is most likely happening here is it in fact a "stun" mechanic that acts like a incapacitate. However. What appears to be happening is that orcs can potentially resist 1 of the two stacks of incapacitate effect from grenandes. So if an orc only resists 1 stack, they still get incapacitated by the grenade but will break on just a single hit unlike other races that need to get hit twice to break out.
---
Top tier
---
The problem is that you'd have to have gold farmers accumulating gold efficiently in large amounts. That means they'd have to grind to 60 most likely 
---
Not only that, but they'd have to have 60's on ***every server*** they could. That's a challenge in its own right 
---
Aside from that, each time a "farmer" is banned, that's a significant financial loss for the gold farming site, especially in time spent
---
It does, if you can do it relatively safely. It keeps healers engaged, which gets harder and harder as you kill things faster and more efficiently. This is especially so  if you are keeping the same number of healers, and aren‚Äôt dropping any (many guilds don‚Äôt due to safety concerns, not wanting players to spend a lot of gold respecing, or wanting to ensure they get playtime to retain them as a member).
---
Also, speed often = parse. The only fight that you‚Äôll really get deaths while trying to parse is melee on Shaz. The rest is absolutely done faster by dpsing better, which leads to a decent parse.
---
Frost for leveling and fire at 60 ide say. They are especially useful in vanilla for sure. I'm making a druid atm but thinking mage for my next one :)
---
You're right on that one. You CAN blink a grenade which incapacitates you. I know it because i've tested it with a guildie.
---
But, it is not a stun. Everything i've said applies.
---
When you say use it, do you mean to equip it or to sell it?
---
As the other poster said, base hit cap is 9% against mobs that are 3 levels higher than you, i.e. raid bosses. The +wep skill racials from humans with swords/maces or orcs with axes reduce the cap to 6%. If you are neither human or orc, you will need to get the edgemaster's handguards gloves to reduce the hit cap to 6%.
---
     
---
You will need to get the %hit from gear. There are a lot of options for %hit gear, but some of the strongest options are the Lionheart Helm 2%, Truestrike Shoulders 2%, and the Devilsaur gloves/legs 2% set bonus.
---
I am horde my friend
---
You can‚Äôt reserve the scales if you dont bring a guildie equipped room collect them.
---
If you go to your social tab&gt;raid &gt;raid info, right after you killed onyxia, you will almost never see the lockout as full 5 day.
---
This is also where you see if you still locked
---
They get paid for it too!  When's the last time anyone tipped a Warlock?  
---
I know people are going to reply saying, "all the time!" but I've never seen it, nor seen it discussed.
---
Don't afk or think too much, always be working the xp bar up even if it means grinding mobs in a place for 2 lvls.
---
&gt;I'm sure they're smart enough to have another middle man or ten to help launder the gold.
---
Probably, but as long as the char is holding some gold it can be traced. On the other hand the advertising accounts are throwaways which at the point where you report them already served their purpose.
---
Crazy how someone can be commenting on the community as a whole/the popular and commonly expressed opinions and still understand that individuals still have different opinions within that community.
---
How's that big brain going?
---
It's still not a stun. Stuns can not be broken on damage. No single stun in the game. The "stun" (incapacitation) from grenades can be broken by damage. Do you see the difference?
---
Maybe mages being able to blink out of it is a bug.
---
Hunter&gt; rogues face the facts.
---
This is what we did only thing is domo kept sending me to the fire and running into the healers and dps. What can I do to prevent this or should an OT be on domo to taunt if I get teled.
---
Would you mind copy/pasting the full macro? I'd like to steal some elements from this but I'm unfamiliar with using macros to change UI elements.
---
Does anyone know if it's possible to use a macro to quickly switch profiles in bartender or dominos?
---
I have a character on Area 52 Horde, too. And yeah, that server is pretty much dead on horde side. Alliance is a little better, because it's pretty unbalanced (66% alliance on 120).
---
Try logging on to Blackmoore Horde and Orgrimmar will be full with people. Just create a test character and use your hearthstone to get directly to OG.
---
This isn't a great idea...  
---
Aside from the points already made about class specific quests like pets for hunter/warlock and totems for shaman, you're also going to screw yourself out of reputation discounts. Specifically for your mounts, but there may be other things that require some faction rep with the major factions.
---
I went to grind UC rep on my hunter only to remember that quests which are grey to you only grant about 10% of the reputation gain as they woudl when they are level appropriate. So when you get to 60 and have 0 rep with your home factions you're going to have to do a really really slow grind, either by doing all those quests you skipped or by buying/farming runecloth. From what I understand it takes 9000+ runecloth to grind to exalted.
---
This is interesting, unfortunately as a gnome player I haven't had willing orcs to help me test it out. Sounds like a job for horde side.
---
you called someone out who didn‚Äôt miss the joke, he made a joke that you missed. Smh
---
Sounds like it might just be my pride and ego getting in the way. 
---
Thanks for a detailed response. I've been debating picking up DBM for a while. How does it compare to BigWigs? If I'm going to use something, I'd prefer to be able to make it as unobtrusive as I can.
---
They just want to squeeze every second out of the day by continuing their grinds.  Problem is, that is inconsiderate to the Warlock(s) who would also like to do this but are actually dropping what they are doing to show up on time.
---
Ours is a cycle of hatred.
---
yeet yote yoten?
---
Thats not how the game is played.

I've tested it with a guildie, and you can blink out of a grenade. So it's some kind of amalgamation effect, because you can't blink out of an incapacitate effect normally, such as gouge or sap.
---
Agreed! The community, both here and on my server, has been better than I've experienced in years.
---
Thanks!
---
Ooo I wonder - I have two mice I use, depending where my laptop is. They're both Logitech but use different software. I'll make sure there's not something silly going on there where they have multiple bindings.
---
As a ally on herod i wouldnt change it for the world im a pretty geared shadow priest and i roll around with a rogue and its endless ganks. Horde are EVERYWHERE and i love it. We pile up 7 bodies or so they all try and take their bodies and chase us down the road it‚Äôs hilarious rinse and repeat
---
Wondering how I, as a warrior, am gonna make money once I hit 60.
---
I use questie addon. And I try to hit zones 3-4 lvls after quests are avalaible. If theres no good zones I just grind mobs or try to do dungeons. Dungeons are hard to do now cause not so many ppl lvling so try to snipe a quest run to every close dungeon. My horde warr I grinded dungeons 90%. Horde rogue 90% quests, alliance druid 90% quests. 52+ I do tirion quest line, ony attunement and pure dungeon farm for gear.
---
to be short and concise imo rogue is a more fun class in pvp and pve as a damage dealer but it struggles to find groups... there were days where I would spend 6 hours looking for a tank to stratholme or scholo only to give up... if you want to run ubrs you have to make ur own group as well...  
---
as a druid you should get ready to either tank or heal... as a tank gearing up should be a breeze, idk about finding an established guild that needs one though... so most druids end up as healers...
---
I don't get why this would need a reddit post
---
To avoid this usually in groups I‚Äôm in everyone will need. Just because usually everyone wants them regardless.
---
Wow im also on Westfall and I get only like one a day
---
How did your main rank deal with being teleported?
---
I'm sure people will be leveling alts and whatnot later on, and everyone isn't 60 yet either. I would not sweat it!
---
As far as pre-raid BiS gear goes; the lists existing now should stay pretty accurate, but if new raids are released those will obviously put more demand on your gear so you are more or less required to have geared up in the previous raid tiers. Pre-raid BiS applies to gear before you start doing the first raid tiers, it doesn't as much apply to higher raid tiers since those will be more difficult. Perhaps you manage to join a guild that's already done that, then you might be able to either join some MC/Ony runs to level up or perhaps pop into BWL if you're more or less full pre-raid BiS. Would put my money on the former, though - you'll probably want some raid gear.
---
Nope.
---
You stay inside of the SFK instance when you hop out of dungeon bounds.
---
OP is talking about hopping out of bounds and being transported out of the instance.

Yes, keep going. Keep spamming your opinion, without any evidence to back it up. Great way of discussing something.
---
If you don't want to discuss, why the fuck are you here? You said you're at work. Fucking work then instead of adding nothing at all to this discussion. I hope your boss notices you wasting his time.
---
Wow you must be richer than I am. I've only gotten 2 on Westfall (US). ‚òπÔ∏è
---
In reality myself and the guild's other 40+ warrior rode our mounts there, the warlock braved many ganks to get there on foot and then we just sat behind a hill and summoned in guildies until we ran out of alts to invite.
---
I have to give props to the level 19 human rogue that despite multiple fears, /NOs and watching 2/3 of his HP disappear in a single warning shot, STILL decided to keep trying his luck against our group of ?? horde as we were waiting to summon at the entrance to the building.
---
This is a good idea.
---
1) it encourages people to show up on time, or face a gold fee.
---
2) it rewards Warlocks for being on time+for the time/effort of the soulstone
---
3) it adds to the guild bank regardless so its a win for everyone, even those that are late.
---
Actually you are the sad part here in most posts.
---
And it is not a grammatical error, you just used a wrong word completely.
---
Nice story though.
---
I unfortunately are can only rp the warrior way...get heal and dps to get shit done. :)
---
So basically I was right and you were wrong.   I'm glad you got there.  
---
If you want to test if grenades are affected by orc racial go for it.
---
I believe it's 130% for people outside melee range to pull the mob. Otherwise, this is the exact explanation I logged in to provide.
---
There's a shrike to a dead player on the eastern tip of Hillsbrad's coast that I had never seen before until I farmed fishing last week.
---
Thanks!

To add to this, you can talk to any guard regardless of you killed another one
---
My friend told me about this last night. My mind was blown and my life has been changed forever.
---
There have been days where I wont get any but there are also days where I could get these back to back all day long. It seems to vary. I'm on Bigglesworth-Horde.
---
This is exactly the reason why I am waiting a few weeks before starting raiding. I'm already behind on gearing compared to the die hards of my guild. I dinged 60 one week ago but I don't have time to run dungeons atm. I'm not going to let others pressure me in keeping up with the gear when I can just wait and get gear the others already have. The last will be the first.
---
manson my man, why does anything require a reddit post? i'm just documenting my progress through wow classic, having some fun along the way.
---
So you can't initiate combat for 17 seconds, I get ya :)
---
What a normie comment. I just use arcane power and an elixir. And no it is way more than a 10-15% increase. Read the talents.
---
Oh this is sad, how will you camp lowbie questing areas without your vanish? I think they should break your blind and sap abilities too, stoopid rogues.
---
Sounds very wonky, cheers for testing. This has to be some form of bug, it sounds like a hybrid of stun and incapacitate just as you say. Weird stuff.
---
yeah.. I still have [this shit](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17007/stonerender-gauntlets) collecting dust in bank ever since I was levelling in Un'goro
---
Equip it
---
I play on Faerlina and that‚Äôs about how it is for me. Maybe once an hour or something like that. I still have block channel invites enabled
---
They're all getting closed due to rule 7 :(
---
One tank can take all the adds, you kill garr first then aoe down the adds.
---
Only on PvP servers
---
play the game how you like it, and i do it as well ok ?  
---
You have in no way any hard time from somebody else his add ons
---
Oh I know. I‚Äôm just saying there‚Äôs so many new bot accounts being made. You‚Äôd think there‚Äôs a script blizz could run that automatically reviews chat invite spamming people containing WWW and GOOD.
---
Thats a good idea. I was thinking rogue purely for the gathering and pickpocketing when I want to be pacifist for a night so druid might be a good idea
---
Very helpful, now I know exactly what it means...
---
Aww I'm sure he'll cry over 20s worth of pearls for 2 more days
---
I re-rolled on this server awhile back, it's a very chill server with friendly people, and the server feels very casual. Big difference from Zandalar tribe where I started out.
---
Haven't bothered with guilds yet, but just grouping up with people has been fine so far. Haven't come across any drama at all.
---
Also it's an RP server, so feel free to start an RP conversation with other players. If they don't join in, that's ok, but you never know what it leads to.
---
Have fun, I'm jealous of first time wow players. It was such an amazing experience the first time, running though the vast wow world a decade ago.
---
a shame.
---
Yeah but same goes basically everything. When challenging thing is new it really is challenging. But when knowledge starts to pile up we find new and more efficient ways to solve problems. It is not just WoW raids but everything in life.
---
Good read, and sounds exactly like what happened with me more than once on razorgore recently with the cowardly guys who are happy to exist next to you until they've got an advantage. 
---
I dare say i often play with a few beers or a vodka n coke, alcohol certainly helps make pvp deaths more personal and all grinds are out of the window when that happens.
---
We ended up in all out war outside blackrock mountain the other night v loads of alliance all because one of our guys got killed, so we killed two, they killed three, we killed four, they killed five and so on, god i love it, and as you say, this would never be a think in retail.
---
No, stick with the axes. You're in a good spot, just focus on achieving 6% hit in full plate or plate and mail, keep a decent shield for harder hitting stuff, and farm Onyxia. Deathbringer is likely your only weapon upgrade at this point.
---
For real. They should auto ban people who send out chat invites more than a couple times a minute that have WWW and GOLD in the chat title.
---
Had you have just said ‚Äúmy bad guys i messed up‚Äù instead of attacking the first person asking if the missed a reference....no one would have given a shit. Its the ignorance that you **feel** like you can change the meaning of what a word means because your experience warrants the new meaning. 
---
Its actually insane.
---
It's not an opinion it's a verifiable fact that mages can blink grenade stun off.  Just because you arent aware of this fact doesn't change the reality of it.  The last guy arguing with me tested it and accepted I'm right.  This isn't some complicated thing that's difficult to test you can either take my word for it or perform the simple test and know for certain that what I say is true.
---
Raiding is a team game, if your fun comes at the cost of other people having less fun, then your fun is not more important than their fun. One of the advantages of being the raid leader this early in the game is that I get to judge people's attitudes in a setting where a single person with a bad attitude won't make the raid implode and then fix the issue before it halts progression in BWL/AQ. If a mage believes that he is too good to decurse in MC, then I get the pleasure of asking the recruiters to find me a new mage.

No, that is Faerlina. I can't tell what has to be going on in someone's head that they willingly roll on a server where 5% of the server's pop is constantly following around one dude on a PVP server.

Ah okay. We just had a stealth run where the rogue got feared into the captain, so we had to kill him. That didn't allow us to pick up buffs.

---
When they changed the server code back in either WOD or Legion, this is when it started happening and Classic uses a version of that, thus it gets the same problem. Always thought it was just related to sharding on retail but it's clearly more than that, I wish they could revert some of the code changes they made.
---
I think it‚Äôs just your compass
---
My worst problem are quest items that do not automatically destroy after finishing the quest. I can not destroy them. I just cant. I have many...
---
The text from the invite still shows up in chat and I've had people repeatedly inviting me until I blocked them. It's still way better than dealing with the pop up though.
---
Players got more money because OTHER PLAYERS spent money. If that's the case it would've been better if the people who bought toys just gave 100% of that money directly to the prize pool.
---
The demand for it will keep dropping as better loot becomes available.
---
Profanity filter?

With your prebis and the magister pieces you have you should be super fine for ZF. Gem+robe+small mana pots are well enough imo even at fresh 60.

Adding to his advice, if you do bind strafe to A and D, you can use Q and E as binds for your abilities instead. Personally I have my most used abilities on Q and E, since they're the easiest buttons to reach

the SetView parts: I placed my camera at a position I was happy with with ActionCam enabled and then typed /run SaveView(2) to override the default View2 with mine so I could recall than position within the macro. SetView(3) is to place the camera in the default View(3) after closing

You can cast all spells in it

Is this for all lower level dungeons or just dm? We have a 6th and it would be really awesome to not have this issue for dungeons

---
Mage here. Was using nifty stopwatch and camping BRM for Jed spawns for 9 days. Saw 4 people get their trinkets from my instance IDs. But no complaints, that's the game. Man up and farm your real BIS trinket.
---
That GM's response is in direct contradiction with the announcement that this was a big not 2 days ago.... It's shameful how bad the customer service is now.
---
Were the /roll casinos from vanilla banned?
---
I never see them anymore.
---
Some of us has 2 monitors and use that fancy borderless window option. I know i do.
---
Maybe YOU need to read the talents? You get 3% more damage and 3% more crit = roughly 6% more damage at all times.
---
I've already explained why Arcane Power and Presence of Mind are questionable DPS increases. Why yes. When you pop Arcane Power, you'll get +37.8% damage... for 15 seconds out of a fight. Overall, it averages to around 10-15%
---
Again, assuming you're decently geared, your frostbolt will deal ~800 damage in a raid(non-crit). 150 spellpower will improve it by 129.426 damage(non-crit) on average. Which is... more than 15%.
---
I was wondering because people keep doubting me so I timed it. Yesterday after work I farmed lashers for exactly 4 hours. I got 225g. No satyrs. Believe me if you want. Not sure if maybe dreamfoil are going for a lot on my server (65 silver each) or something.
---
Totally. I was excited to do them to get some kind of gear while farming pre bis. Well too late now. There is no real reason to do those quests anymore for me except gold.
---
at what level would say u could solo Stockades?
---
The ENABLE FISHING MODE  is two parts as reloading the UI would reload the UI elements hidden by the second part
---
I can see nothing wrong with that text.
---
Un'Goro *is* to the west of Tanaris, and Rabine Saturna *is* in Nighthaven, as the text suggests.
---
Well...It's not 100 potions. :)
---
This has also been a thing for 15 years, getting kicked off sends you out of the zone. It always has.
---
I'm on a medium server and see 2-3 an hour easy, when in a city its worse.
---
I dont get any channel invites :(
---
(Ghennas eu)
---
It was always be that way since most people are lazy. For current raid such as MC rag, 90% of melee dps doesn't even check if rag is about to cast his spell knock away the main tank. This supposed to vital ability to be observed by melee DPS because they need to move out so they dun get one shot. 
---
Without add-on, raid leader or someone would be need afk using a time watch to call it out.
---
Even with DBM, you have a lot of dps that doesn't listen to call.
---
aye!!! I think I even put it up 3 times dropping the price each time. Its murder! I was initially so excited to get a purple, but its rotten :D
---
As a shadow priest I find it hard to even motivate me to go to mc or ony. Id go through 2 raids just to roll on an accessory that 20 others are. We have what 4 bis items in raids.
---
Did you also have to make 2 threads about this because they both dropped at the same time?
---
J/K GZ on the swords.
---
I use 2 sets, one for raids, focusing on sp, and other for farming and PVP since both of these focuses on stam/int.
---
 Did you also have to make 2 threads about this because they both dropped at the same time?
---
All dungeons in 1.12 as far as I'm aware. 
---
You take a massive exp drop and apparently quest kills don't count and probably a bunch of other things so it's really only worth it for gear and shenanigans.
---
Wrong, at current gear levels 2h fury is a very viable path to take if you are orc.
---
It also speeds up the gearing if not all fury warriors as waiting for 2x1h.
---
haha good idea. Though, I might got for a warrior tank and use it as my tanking weapon.
---
How do you know if you‚Äôre hit capped or defense capped? Is there a way to actually see this in game? Or are you just adding up totals from gear?
---
lmao, read it and maybe you will understand? if not, go back to school.
---
Lock here... I'm loving it don't get me wrong, but 100% wish I had gone mage at this point.  Don't have enough playtime to level it now though when competing with other classes for an alt.  Having to resummon pet and remake healthstones on top of rebuffing is pretty mana intensive  and makes getting back to the fight a slog, and that's assuming you didn't forgot to make a pile of gems before logging out the day before.  It's no big deal in PVE because you don't use them up that often but when you get around to PVPing and people starting killing your pet and you start popping your green candies it's going to make for a bunch of long resets.  I think having those portals, teleports, food/water, blink, sheep, and best dps invite rate would be better at this point, lol.  Warlock has been a blast though!  I went the orc route but honestly don't think the stun resist is worthwhile over enjoying the aesthetic of what you're playing so if you go lock, stick with your undead.  You'll stare at your character 100% of the time in pve and in pvp but will barely ever need the stun resist comparatively.
---
You're a saint!
---
yought
---
This is unfortunately the best way to learn that you can gear an alt relatively cheap
---
You know a spell can also miss in a short fight, right?
---
If you have 0 hit you will miss 11% of all casts (6% from talents). Lets assume you have 20% crit already with winter's chill and a normal hit does 1000 dmg.   
---
Your average cast now does 1000\*1.2\*0.89 = 1068 damage.  
---
1% additional crit changes that to 1000\*1.21\*0.89 = 1076.9 damage.  
---
1% additional hit changes it to 1000\*1.2\*0.9 = 1080 damage.
---
It doesn't matter how long the fight is, on average over all fights hit is better, because hit also increases your effective crit rate.
---
Expand?
---
If you want to corner a market, choose a commodity that people definitely need and isn't going out of use. Then choose your price that you're going to try to sell at. Buy everything below that price and I mean *everything* and then make list all of your mats/items at your sell price and continue to just buy out everything below it.
---
could you link the full gear list of what you are wearing?
---
Won't that also add dishonorable kills?  90% of the time I'm ganked it's by somebody 10+ levels above me. 
---
From what I remember back in vanilla, when BG started,  world PVP pretty much completely died.
---
Don‚Äôt worry about being ‚Äúleft behind‚Äù. This game will be around for a long time and there is plenty of time to play as you want to. You could re-roll in a year and probably still have plenty of time to gear up to progress Naxx by the time phase 6 comes out. There is no hurry. Enjoy the journey.
---
Will you briefly walk me through that?  I never encountered it in diablo 2.
---
Well I guess as just a follow up are there any dungeons quite as long as BRD? Or is that just an anomaly (I've heard ST is long too but I haven't run it)? Should either Strat or Scholo ever take more than 3 hours?
---
Oh. Aww... You think the one extra person will dump down the exp drastically, or is it just the change from 5-man to raid that triggers the drop?
---
Oh man I didn't even think of that. Awesome!
---
This used to be the case for me but now I can click on the name and report for some reason.
---
I'm still 40.. I guess I'll raid with the alts of current 60 player :D
---
Also on Westfall and I get several a night for thr few hours I'm on.

DAE DEAD GAME?  NOT THIS GUY!!

-waits for karma-
---
I couldn‚Äôt agree more. Faerlina is an awful server for new players. I got roped into playing there because all my friends chose that server. I don‚Äôt play too much due to work and obligations, but queue times are still awful. Sometimes I want to just hop on for an hour and play, but you have to design your schedule around non-peak hours or login remotely. If I was a new player, the queues alone would persuade me to not play the game at all.
---
"Guys, I can't seem to drink after buffing int..."

Im Swedish and you are a very wierd guy in every level. Why would i be English ? Or American? You make no sence bud, you told me how bad i was in your langues and now im not somehow. But thanks i struggle with this langues as a youth, im happy its much better now and got it confiremd
---
&gt; it's hellish to do anything as alliance and horde literally plays on a PvE server *while calling you a carebear if you complain*.
---
Noticed this on my server, where I'm horde. I can do *whatever I want* basically unmolested because there's always groups of horde in raids roaming round every popular area killing any alliance they see. Getting ganked is super rare and all the instance entrances are held by horde 99% of the time. Sure sometimes alliance group up and kill people.. for a few minutes until three times as many horde arrive to camp them.
---
It makes me wonder how many of these "LOL PVP SERVER HAHAHAHAHA" people have ever actually experienced the other side, and if they have had it be a consistent thing every time they log on.
---
The tier sets have no spell power so they‚Äôre not very good for doing damage in raids. Great for PvP though, as they have tons of Stamina and Intellect
---
I will say there's a big difference between players standing there and everyone using spells. An exponential difference actually.
---
This is awesome.
---
Yes. Also there are blue tier sets; Dungeon Tier 1, Dungeon Tier 2, Pre MC Tier 0.5 etc...
---

Dude, whatever. Hope one day someone takes your BoE from you. That's just not what I would do to someone. Good luck!

Why are people upset about this? Imagine it this way. I'm a business owner. Let's say I run a bakery. I'm having an event and I state that I'd like to donate  100$ to charity through the sale of my bread. For every $1 spent on my bread I'll give .25 cents up to the $100 to a charity. I'm guaranteeing that 100$ to the charity whether or not I sell enough bread to cover the cost not. 
---
How is that the same thing blizzard is doing? What are u guys upset about? That they aren't dontanting more money? For real? Theyre already donating the whole prize.

You can get an add-on like Charactera Stats Classic to display that info
---
whats a fap?
---
Ah what we do is have him tanked the opposite side of the pit to the healers, so when the tank gets ported dormo has a bit to run and goes over the top of him giving the tank a chance to pick him up again.
---
I‚Äôm going to say a holy/prot paladin. The issues healers have in general for group PvP/BGs is they‚Äôre often the prime target for the opposing faction. As a holy/prot pally you‚Äôre a nightmare to kill and can happily tank thirsty enemies that make it a priority to bring you down.
---
I play priest personally and I have fun with it but a real killer for me is how mana expensive the main stam buff is. You pretty much go OOM after buffing a handful of people.
---
Def sell now
---
I found the transmute recipe for UD to Water. Ud are like a couple gold and water literally 20-25g. Been making a lot of $ with it.
---
I saw a warrior with perd and core hound... have yet to see a single rogue with both
---
If you replace "the vast wastelands far to the west of Tanaris and Un'Goro" with "Silithus" (which is what it's talking about) it all makes sense.
---
Personally I'd rather see it like this then have to zoom in to a chat on a full print screen,  this is simple
---
I've experienced this. I'm enjoying playing on my RP-PvP server and I rolled Horde because a bunch of irl friends were rolling Horde. I got to lvl 43 on my Orc Rogue and sorta felt I was missing out, so I rolled a Dwarf Rogue on another account so I could stay on the same server. I ended up moving back to my Orc once I got my Dwarf to lvl 43 also. So now I have a 60 Orc and I'm currently lvling my Dwarf who is lvl 48 atm. I think I'll stick to Alliance since that's where the dwarves are at.
---
Cool story, i mean really cool and ended up well.
---
Now, stay a while and listen to mine... We have not enough 60ties at guild so we run at like 30-32 ppl from guild rest pug. Normaly i mean even in random pugs leader beign selfish reserving Bindings and BoE's. But my leaders not, only recipes and cores, dunno why its only MS&gt;OS rest roll even boes.
---
Anyway we running like this 2 weeks and like the rules are, they are very positive for pug ppl. Ended up like that i im halfway to revered without single item, lvl 59 ppl from pugs get 1-2 items, last time one 59 pug get 4 items (no its no druid). Even tho we discussed it via Gchat that RL should told him not to roll after second item he doesnt give a f. He said in beggining the rules and thats set.
---
As the raid continues we got 2 tanks from guild and 1 pug OT (he was just fury wearing shield, with dps items and had bloodthirst), and yes as u can imagine, bindings dropped and he wins it - got em. Even RL told him he could raid with us to get the second one :D
---
Our tanks were fine with it not a single word, said they will take em when we go full g run.
---
 I read somewhere on this reddit, yes its nice ppl get loot sooner or later and not u shouldnt bitching about it, but as u put your effort and time into game as another person (doest count out of raid) you should be rewarded equal, or fair. But some ppl dont give a fk.
---
I'm alliance
---
Another guy did some testing, and it appears it can be blinked for some reason - but since it's breaking on damage, it is also acting as an incapacitate somehow combined with a stun. See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dp4o36/orcs_cant_resist_engineering_grenades_in_wow/f5somq9/) for the comment. Granted there's no video of it happening, but having debated a bit with the poster before he seems a lot more credible and doesn't just keep repeating his claim like a broken record.
---
I think for the same reason stop playing retail at the end of each patch cycle. A raid has been out for a while, you've either got it on farm or hit a difficulty wall. Interest in your guild wanes and you can't fill a raid group anymore.
---
You can't raid the same raids indefinitely whether it's Molten Core, or Ice Crown Citadel or Azshara's Eternal Palace.
---
I'm not trying to be negative - just a little concerned. It's all still ahead of me in classic (i'm lvl 47) and i"m loving it.
---
I‚Äôm on a heavily populated server as well. Some days I get only 1 or two, other days I‚Äôll enter an area and get one every 15 minutes or so.
---
Also I believe certain items (like the staff) will only drop if you do a perfect run (not kill any bosses).
---
That'll do mage.  That'll do.
---
There is tier 0, the dungeon set. For mages, this is the Magisters set. Parts drop in scholo, Strath, LBRS, UBRS. Its good set but there are many other BiS items you can get too. 
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/tier-0-dungeon-set-1-overview-classic-wow](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/tier-0-dungeon-set-1-overview-classic-wow) 
---
Tier 1 is the next raid set, which drops in Molten Core. Rags drops leggings from Tier 2, and Ony drops the head from Tier 2. All other bosses in MC drop Tier 1 gear. 
---
Blackwing Lair when its released, drops the rest of Tier 2 set. 
---
AQ40 - drops Tier 2.5 set
---
Naxx - drops Tier 3 set.
---
The sets make up 8 pieces of armor, which give additional stats based on how many pieces you have of said set.
---
Found myself a pair of Thorbia's Gauntlets, which are considered to be the only good gloves for level 19 twinks.
---
Currently on my server they only for for about 7 gold. Obviously this SHOULD go up once PVP becomes a thing. That being said, is it worth listing them in P2, or would you guys wait until battlegrounds are released?
---

When everyone knows what they are doing and the group consists of all 60s, I've finished Strat UD, live, Scholo under an hour. Strat live is slightly longer. DM North Tribute can be done around 20-40 min, especially if the party has a rogue and brought the frozen trap and ogre suit. 
---
Arena run is very short. If you just keep doing arena runs, you can get instance locked pretty quickly. People usually throw in General Angerforge or General Angerforge and Golemlord in the run.
---
Lava run is pretty much the other name for princess/emp run. Having a rogue and a mage in the group will make things go a lot faster. Killing princess also makes it faster and easier. It can be done under an hour. 
---
Didn't run DM E, DM W, UBRS and LBRS too much, but I remember them being under 2 hours for sure with a decent group.
---
Only Rag and Geddon needs Fire Resist.
---
These 10 RF won't change shit. You can get them elsewhere. Yes OP should change guild. He did the pre bis farm work and isn't getting rewarded for it when people will raid and get stuffed pretty fast since 2 or 3 people max will really need Tank gear therefore getting him really behind now.
---
Change as there's still people starting. MT's are vanilla guilds cornerstones and well established ones will be unmovable soon, if a guild stuffs MT's they will do it hard and trust them. Player leaving is the only reason to change a geared tank since gameplay should be used to choose them at first.
---
MT'ing also requires communication, and this skill requires integration in the guild and confidence. Get a trusted and nice group of people while you still can.
---
Whats there to know? You just sell shit?
---
Good level for searing gorge and blasted lands
---
Need over Greed unless you are a mouth breather.
---
Easier than a Paladin
---
I think this addon is bugged.  The other day I was swapping gear back and forth and watched my stats stay the same.
---
There's only 1 bis item tho.
---
Funny enough I chose warlock and am enjoying DoTing everything to death
---
Furbolg medicine pouch, celestial orb
---
Mage looking for mc guild. Look at my logs here at www.madeupwarcraftlog.com were you can see me top ondecurses and wanding to save mana for more decurse!
---
Dear Lord... have mercy on their souls...
---
You have to include MCP if you're talking bosses. It's a big draw of playing a druid. You dont really need them for OT (Druids excel at this btw) but the bosses you want a druid to tank like Vael you're always using a pummeler
---
Should ideally be need over greed, but always discuss with your group. 
---
If it's a bunch of sketchy or untrustworthy sounding randoms you might be better off calling for a "everybody need" roll, just to make sure no one grabs it for gold. As sad as that may sound.
---
I wish
---
Damnit this reading thing is hard!
---
Engineering is the go to profession for hunters
---
Is there a solid fury warrior theory crafting link or video to help me min max and/or get to grips with all my rotations, potential specs etc
---
Remember to report them, that's the most important thing. Left click on their name -&gt; report
---
Tank logs are also DPS based which is completely logical - not. It promotes padding, staying in Berserker stance during the Execute phase and goin to town with Reck/Deathwish and the like.
---
I have the Ironfoe and don't know which offhand I should use to maximize my dps on raids. I have the Muggers Belt which gives +5 daggers. Is Perditions Blade bis for my offhand? 
---
Also, is Deathbringer + Brutality blade + Edgemasters better than Ironfoe + Perditions Blade + Muggers Belt?
---
I like the fast speed of the latter because it means I gain rage faster but I'm not really sure which combo deals higher dps.
---
Oh really? How so? I've never even bothered to try it, since I mained Priest for the last 15 years, I thought I wasn't missing on anything.
---
With class being so uneven it wouldn't work really and would push more on playing the best class, the best gear with best talent build only.
---
Hell no.
---
Drives me mental that there are one or two guilds on my server who think they're top dog (they're not by a long shot) can just pop ony head without any warning.
---
Whilst the rest of the actual top raiding guilds all communicate with each other on when they will pop the head and who can go next etc.
---
Thanks man. Bummer. But I'll see if we can try it out tonight and find out how good/bad it is.
---
How is it 120 gold, geez... your server is pretty fucked. We have black lotus at 40 and my alt crafts them for 55 gold worth of mats a flask. Double respec is 100 gold by comparison, so that's a big OOF
---
A fail from me sorry
---
We get it. Fuck off already thanks :)
---
I don‚Äôt know time for sure but yes regardless of when anybody kills her everybody‚Äôs reset timer is the same.
---
Nah, withrogue you can actually choose a stealthy vs just go in their face playstyle and what combo moves you like.
---
I heard they just seal of judgement and auto attack?
---
You do realize you're intentionally being a moron by arguing semantics, right?
---
Because this concept is so hard for you to grasp, I'll keep it as elementary as possible and then just MAYBE your tiny mind might be able to understand. Say we all have a 5% chance to have our specific weapon drop but every weapon can be sold to buy the weapon of any class. There are 9 classes, so what was once a 5% chance becomes a 45% chance because no matter what weapon drops, you're guaranteed to get your weapon.
---
Every player can either rely on a 5% chance for their weapon to drop, or a 45% chance. Surely you're not too dense to grasp such a simple concept.
---
No I never liked such mechanics. If you want to make additional harder instances, make harder instances.
---
Awesome
---
I feel like there is 2 procs you‚Äôre fishing for. The Bloodlust and stat buff. The stat buff is +50. That‚Äôs an extra 50 str and agi for 3 other warriors or rogues.  I‚Äôve never dug into theorycrafting much but would the boost to the 3-4 other dps in the group out weigh what you lose by using it? Idk I could be biased and just want this cool sword to be good.
---
It always works, it's just a different mind set. If everyone views BoE as gold, then that means anyone can use gold.
---
No, then people start requiring IO score and shit, get out with that. I'm for classic plus but not mythic+ where its required for free loot, keep that in retail and i actually hope they remove it and just make it challenge mode.
---
Nice man!
---
I did end up rolling lock
---
I‚Äôm just burnt out on leveling. I want to be able to raid with my guild so obviously I want to hit 60. I love playing my character and I love the abilities but watching the xp bar slowly, slowly drag along to the next level is getting to me
---
What the fuck does that have to do with speed? Who cares if they can't stand it. It would still be faster to use the computer. You really are stupid.
---
And when you start doing BRDs, make sure you keep the Onyxia and MC attunement quests in mind. Don't wait until level 60 to get attuned if you would like some T1 or T2 gear. The Onyxia attunement quests is particularly long and requires you to return to BRD several times.
---
Anything that helps world pvp, consumables, mats that are required to level engineering, health/mana pots +faps etc etc. the phase only really brings pvp, so just think what people need for the pvp
---
Got 3 today :p
---
i am glad in my server we don't act like you said... Here we click "need"  when we intend to use the items and "greed" elsewise.
---
I am a warrior, a few days ago i was doing a dire maul run with four guys I've never played with, and when the QS book dropped they just clicked "greed" , wrote gg and let me need it.
---
Wearing glasses isn't going to magically make illegible text more legible. The font, while thematic, is a legibility nightmare to begin with.

Warrior Discord is named fight club I think.
---
I ran with it for a while as a test, but it wasn't really worth it.
---
You don't want to go Fire until you're raiding AQ and Naxx. A lot of mobs and bosses resist fire in MC and BWL.
---
Carefully he‚Äôs a hero
---
i did the same
---
U need a sertant population to reach r12+ otherwise u get 0 progress with st1.... Glad u understood the formula... Ond those server u can't reach R14
---
Jaden salutes you.
---
Grats, silly luck to get both in one run, and to not have anyone else need - but I guess you had a tailored group to counteract the insanity of rolling vs 5 others. 
---
Is that name derived from the mythic Pickle monster mentioned in a certain cartoon series? If so, better stack up on Leper Gnome masks from the All Hallow's Eve event!
---
It‚Äôs really bad and makes leveling in a raid nearly impossible. I think after the hotfix we were getting 27xp per mob in scarlet monastery
---
Have you tried simulating it? This seems like something you can't answer without trying it first.
---
Which is exactly what he does
---
This is such pseudo-elitist bullshit, seriously. If you get killed 1 vs 3+ all the time that has nothing to do with not wanting PvP, you just can't do anything.
---
I play horde, so I only see all the alliance players getting killed without any chance whatsoever. They get out of BRD and there are 30 hordes already. That's some nice PvP right there!! SO MUCH FUN, RIGHT??
---
If anything will kill this game (on PvP servers) it's faction balance.
---
Yeah its Stalagg (H). The economy overall is actually pretty solid. All mats for enchants and most other stuff is strangely cheaper than what I've seen on other servers, but all the raid consumables are very expensive.
---
If nothing else, it's a fun way to get some gear for your under-levelled alts.
---
Waste of ignore spots honestly.
---
All these are rough estimates of smooth runs without wipes and the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù route. Mobs groups skips stuff like Jandice in School and whelp room boss in UBRS.
---
UBRS: 1h
---
LBRS: 1.5h
---
Strat live: 1h
---
Strat undead: 1h
---
BRD: 3-5h (depends on the lvl of each attendee, if you are ally or horde etc)
---
Scholo: 1-1.5h
---
DM east (full run): 45 mins
---
DM north tribute: 30-45 mins
---
DM west: 1-1.5h
---
I started as mage and got to 34 by AoE grinding... that I got vwet bored of and I got to the level of wpvp on my server and with those talents have 0 real survival chance
---
Thanks man!
---
This is the entirety of my MC raiding discord experience. How the fuck is it that difficult to look the big ass shiny?
---
Oh, I completely agree, I spent a lot of my time on Durotan, between WotLK and MoP and while it wasn't completely dead, it was low pop. and it kinda sucked.
---
That said, ever since Blizzard introduced new servers after realizing how popular Classic proved to be, naysayers have been using the "that server will be dead two months from now" argument to rationalize not moving off an overpopulated server.
---
Two months later, most of the servers (afaik) are still alive and well. ie.: There's a lot of ground to cover between "dead" and "so full you can't farm", but if you listen to some people here and on forums, it's either one or the other...
---
Funny enough I use the FR pieces for some fights, they have a pile of stam so you end up very beefy for soaking damage
---
Not all. You can't 10-man DM: North, for example. Found out the hard way.
---
Shut up already, just play the fucking game and don't bother others with your elitist shit.
---
[f00l.de](https://f00l.de) is the only one i know of.
---
Whats a strong eu pvp server where allies are?
---
This.
---
Whilst I agree that making it freeroll isn't ideal, I don't think trading for money is either.
---
In the same light, BoEs shouldn't be rolled on by only those who can use it, because they may just be sold by those classes.
---
In a guild run you'll spend DKP to buy BoEs, and they expect you to equip it. You win an item with DKP, you use it!
---
If everyone agrees that nobody would actually use it, and would instead sell it, it goes to the guild bank.
---
You're a hero IRL as well!
---
What great parse with double mana costs and -75% healing debuff &gt;.&gt;
---
Represent.
---
I have this issue also with the Extended Character Stats addon. These addons doesn't seem to react well to swapping back and forth. It's best to /reload ui after swapping.
---
Its the sound you make when you throw something. It's in reference to this vine: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Bjy5YQ5xPc
---
This was lvl 25 me with lvl 15 brother about to 2 man rfc as alliance
---
Someone commented that it's WeakAuras, which is an awesome albeit complex addon. If it looks confusing, don't worry, you can download pre-made templates for just about anything at wago.io . 
---
Just browse through and find something you like, it should have a link to copy a string of characters and then use /wa to open weakaura and go to Import and just paste the string of characters and it should import it just like you saw on the site.
---
Of course they will. I've had the Death Ray and Net-o-Matic backfire on me quite a few times.
---
Sekram here. Only got one ever.
---
I've had a few experiences of a seller inviting me 3+ times in 30 seconds spamming the chat because they can just reinvite. Its rare, but still not as bad as the pop up.
---
Ah, ok, classic Classic quest, make me go super far north and then go super far south west...
---
Mate after it evens out it will not have more players than retail lol. It might have more players now but once more casual lvlers reach 60 there won't be many people left.
---
Then I guess with every phase some will come back for a few months but the numbers will be steadily low.
---
Once 8.3 releases you will see a bigger decrease
---
General consensus here seems to be "depends how much it sells for"
---
Yeah but it says b√∂g not bog. Two different letters
---
Idk about paying 1.5 gold for something that is solved with one button.
---
Well. Not counting running around for quests, book, etc I guess.
---
Iirc on most recent lists Wyrmguard Shoulders are the bis for phase 1/2 overall. Domo shoulders are better for pure damage soak fights though
---
Blizzard scales very badly with spell dmg. You might as well switch to gear with more int and gain more damage by being able to cast one extra blizzard.
---
Need over greed unless is particularly valuable.
---
a lvl 35 alt can make all the potions you need, on top of an arcanite cooldown every couple days
---
Yeah that was my point.  This conversation started from somebody regretting not rolling a PVP server because of this story.  my comment was their assumption that PVP servers were nothing but ganking was correct, they really are nothing but ganking.
---
Today I was in Winterspring, and about five bis geared alliance kill the horde flight path and anyone landing.  They did this for a good 30 minutes, until finally enough horde got together and kill them pretty quickly.  Did they stick around for an epic battle?  They call back up in?  Nope they immediately left.  For 30 minutes of ganking, it all came to an end in about 60 seconds. 
---
The only reason why it came to an end because it was Winterspring and there were some relatively high-level 50s.  They pull the same thing in places like Thorium Point, but nobody groups up to fight them there.   But even flight point ganking isn't even close to the most common ganking, the most common PVP encounter is a 60 moving through a zone ganking lowbies.  
---
PVP is why there's pressure in classic wow to level as fast as possible.  Which makes it start feeling like a job.  So anybody who wants to "enjoy the journey" should not be in a PVP server.
---
Or you just suck at explaining. /Gegga_87 made the same point in 2 sentences clearly.
---
The culture of today is clickbait outrage culture. Its toxic, and its tearing society apart.
---
WoW Classic was from a different era, and its refreshing to see that so many people haven't been corrupted by the culture of today.
---
Nobody did.
---
As a tank orc warrior, in a loot council guild, should the epic axe drops go to me because it‚Äôs so much better for my hit or should all other fury warriors be prioritized? Ok it‚Äôs vague, sorry, talking about the only axe
---
Congrats, pickle man.
---
Man, let's hope they curtail their plans around you!
---
They are more valuable in p3 than p2 - but gold is more valuable now than later, too. I'd list them at the end of p2
---
Yeah, no one ever told me that I'd be trading money for any and all passion from my life lmao. Would've been nice to know that the only choice wasn't to follow the money first and foremost.
---
Fucking snitch.
---
a tank druid has to carry a bunch of MCPs for maximum performance. Those are all non-stacking 'consumables'.
---
Meh, some people take this game way too seriously and seem to have anger management issues...
---
A few weeks back, someone threw a tantrum at me for leaving his Nathos Blightcaller (or whatever his name is) raid group.
---
I even asked him if it was ok for me to drop group so I could complete a quest while he was still filling it up and he said it was fine, so I did.
---
Less than 5 minutes later, he started crying and blaming me because the group apparently fell apart after I left it, saying it was *my* fault. I tried to reason with him, but there was no reasoning him.
---
People like that scare me, to be honest. I can't imagine how they'd react to actual upsetting RL situations.
---
I tried to talk guildies into a Stockades run after the first time through Deadmines but I'd already earned most of them 3 ghost runs by then so motivation to ghost run all the way through Stormwind was limited.
---
I gave up and just shouted loudly through the mic, worked for about 4 dogs then i gave up and dropped skinning all together and went herb the next day.
---
Also, as an undead lvl 47 combat sword rogue I just got the thrash blade in my main hand, should I use vanquishers sword or sword of omen in my offhand?
---
So you pay real world money to gold sellers, do not accept the gold, all to report the player with a smile on your face?
---
I work too hard for my money to give it away like that.
---
Yes. Yes there is a DR sir on cc and stuns.
---
We got another 6 months at least before we see bwl so you got a lot more MC to go
---
&gt; Is Perditions Blade bis for my offhand? 
---
If you take Perdition's Blade for  your offhand I think I'd cry.
---
Cute,  warriors believe they'll win v hunter especially when engaged upon
---
I'm very indecisive. I want to start an alt as my hunter is nearing the level cap. I wanted to start it at 50 but now I'm 59 and still can't decide.
---
I'm playing Horde and I was thinking of going either warlock or mage. I used to play lock and hunter in vanilla as well and I generally learned to like the lock and played it into TBC and got to love it. But I feel like there's less maintenance and gear requirements for mage (no shards, talents with hit) as well as more mobility in general. So is the grass just greener or? From what I can tell (despite being Horde) there are more mages on the server but possibly more demand for them as well.
---
I also thought of going for a hybrid to either tank or heal due to the lack of those - particularly the former but I'm not sure I'd enjoy it as much as going dps caster.
---
So any thoughts?
---
What are the chances that this is related to the Legion build they're using to recreate Classic?
---
First I suspected that maybe the core game has issues with this many players but Nostalrius managed fine with more players. 
---
So what the fuck's wrong? This will be a mess with P2.
---
Warrior isn't a popular class in 19 bracket.
---
Actually forgot that IO was a thing. Ye I hate the idea of IO too :/
---
Wouldn‚Äôt say it was pseudo-elitist
---
It was at least elitist.
---
Yeah, I figured, thanks for the confirmation. The other person must be a troll, or wildly rich enough to not mind paying real world money and risking their accounts just to report gold sellers!
---
I managed to feral charge through the floor in Sunken Temple (dragon level) a couple of days ago.  Wish I'd had slow fall :(
---
I carry it proudly in my bags everywhere I go.
---
Sick, I'm definitely getting one then, thanks!
---
I bought a mouse with 12 keys so I could play shaman
---
40+ gold = need if you're playing with randoms
---
I'll sell it for my mount or buy an upgrade for myself
---
Nobody deserves anything just because they can use it right away.
---
That was the word i was looking for "Toxic" and not just toxic, that be Toxic AF
---
The Spy addon is legit? Or we risk a ban?
---
It's only like 10g? Wtf
---
I‚Äôm on a medium pop and certain pieces I get them one after the other. Zul‚ÄôFarrek being the worst so far. I‚Äôll get five or six on a single half hour ZF run. 
---
*note: even blocked, you still see in the text section.
---
Cold snap ;)
---
Yes, this is true, unless you use your toon for PVP only and not level.  Back in the day, I had a lv 29 Mage only for PVP, so I could be max level for the lv 30-39 PVP.
---
Yeah, it isn't sustainable at all. I only got around to sorting out my gear sets a couple days ago, I haven't had time to get lost in the settings weeds.
---
Even though Zandalar Tribe is still layered I haven't had any queues apart from first launch-week. The population is therefore, in my opinion, very good and stable. Once layering is removed I'm expecting queues at the start but nothing compared to other mega-servers and the queue will eventually go away after a short time.
---
**Speaking for Horde-side:**
---
The server is boiling with energy and friendly people all over the place. I've had surprisingly few bad dungeon runs during my journey to 60 main and a level 38 alt. There are regular PuG-raids being thrown together and I've yet to come in a bad one after a month of PUG-raiding.
---
I got into my guild by stumbling upon a lone mage when I was level 40 doing some quests in STV and thereafter got invited to his small guild and now, 1,5 months later, were PuG-raiding, RP-ing and are just being silly together in our small guild-community. 
---
The faction is somewhat balanced, i'd guess around 55/45 Alliance-favoured. I think most PvP feels respectful and there are no big group of people only there to "sabotage" in, for example, Blackrock Mountain. People are around to help with the few corpse campers that occur. 
---
I hope you'll join us, the server is one of the best I've ever played on (compared to both from 13 years in retail and a few level 20 alts on different servers). Just remember to roll horde so that we can stay as close as 50/50-balance as possible ;)
---
Hit me up @Atha on Horde
---
It's a bit up for debate, currently I use Truestrike for Aggro, Atal'ai for Mitigation and Fireguard for Resist. I have the Wyrmtongue as a hybrid option between Aggro and Mitigation, but I never find myself using them.
---
You can't get banned for using an addon, and it's been around for ages anyway.
---
As a rogue with engi, going for PvP, I just lvled my engi to 205. Is it goblin or gnomish first?

What's the order and what gadgets do I need to make before switching? I googled it but everything gives different answers.. just want a direct answer, like gnomish, make "these gadgets" then switch go goblin and do these!  
---
I'd really love an answer! thanks!
---
i am not saying i am doing that :D i am saying it can be done.
---
BRD is an anomaly for how long it is. Most people only run certain sections, such as Jail Break! run, which clears out both loops in the first area and does the Jail Break! quest event, there's Arena/anger/argal runs, which hit Arena, then Angerforge, and often finishing with Argalmach, because of the high quality gear to be obtained from those places, with low drop rates. Then there are Emperor runs, which can either go the normal route to him, or do a lava run, where you jump down into the lava and skip to the Lyceum.
---
ST is a bit longer than normal, but not as long as BRD. There's a basement in ST that's home to a few quests, but you can skip it and save 45 min.
---
Strat and Scholo should take about an hour, maybe a bit longer (depending on wipes and the other things I mentioned). Strat is really two runs bolted into the same instance: Strat Live (ending with Balnazzar) and Strat Dead (ending with Baron Rivendare). If you do both sides, you might break two hours.
---
LBRS is actually longer than UBRS, often taking an hour and a half to two hours. Each wing of DM can be finished in 45 minutes with a good group, but I'd budget twice that.
---
I have seen multiple blues so I don‚Äôt think this is exactly correct. But each boss you put up improves the loot
---
The First 18-20 lvl are Pain as mage . But as soon you get your 3/3 improved blizzard ,  its a bless. I mean you have to drink After every pull then. But you will Kill 3-10 Mobs in everypull. That means Tones of money greens etc to sell.
---
I had the Gold for the First Mount with 40. And Got my epic Mount 1 day After hitting 60 because of All the Stufe you will get. Found 2 epics du≈ïring lvl process
---
I use 2 pummeler chargers on phase 1 than switch to a new one and use 2 more charges on phase 3 when she lands.
---
r/dankmemes is the shitty version of r/dankmemes, has been for like 3 years now.
---
Where to farm the shit that you want to vendor.
---
I had my eye on druid cause of the wpvp potential, but read that they're not very desired since their heals are really weak compared to others. How true is that?
---
There is DR...
---
Rank 1
---
Everyone is going to tell you frost single target if you‚Äôd going solo. I‚Äôm here to tell you that I‚Äôm going straight fire single target and it‚Äôs making questing go very very fast and smooth and it‚Äôs way more fun than frost. For some reason everyone thinks fire is crap or doesn‚Äôt exists for mages or something, I dunno. But deep fire has worked amazing for me.
---
I knew I shouldn't have clicked on that mail from Frodoscammins
---
I cant speak on daoc, but warhammer online was shit, it would lag out every castle battle.
---
Incendius I get one about every hour
---
You seem to think I was advocating for this set which isn‚Äôt the case. Simply answering his question man.
---
I'm banking on the fact that the number of ticks is still the same in Classic as it is in Retail only they're simulating a lower tick rate for that true authentic experience.
---
Issues arise when a real time lower tick rate is actually required
---
You considered getting banned? Weird.
---
It was being massively exploited and got nerfed within the first week or two.
---
It‚Äôs not difficult work, but it‚Äôs honest!
---
Allright I'm pretty sure your a troll, cause I doubt someone is this dense but sure.
---
- All your 1-5 points have never been said, well not by anyone sensible and for sure not en masse. Everyone knew because of all the hype that the release would be a giant succes.
---
- Yes sir it will fall off, like many say my friendslist went from 30 classic players to +/-5, this is anecdotal but seeing this sub, quite indicative. Expect a drop off till P3 with probably spikes in drop when 8.3 hit. This game simply doesn't have enough content for years off play. This is perfectly fine, but don't lie to yourself.
---
- There are absolutely no numbers available. You're literally just making up statestics. Does classic have more players right now? Probably but there is no way of telling. Many people, like myself, have a sub and play both games. How do you come up that classic has 4* more players? 
---
But I guess I'm in denial?
---
What? You're calling them a stun, when they're clearly not. Are you kidding me? What other stun in game gets removed on damage?
---
Get a long thin piece of paper, stick it to your screen, make sure it covers your xp bar and just enjoy fighting mobs. Make sure they are green, yellow or orange ;)
---
Not a lot of options if you're already set to low. Turn off Vertical Synch and anti-aliasing if you have them on.
---
You can also make the following macro to use whenever you log in
---
    /console ffxspecial 0
---
    /console ffxGlow 0
---
After that I'd suggest fiddling around in your nvidia or radeon settings to adjust things there.
---
Everything that's farmed in the open world because their will be roaming gank squads in every single 48+ zone making it impossible to farm
---
Oh, ok, well yes, it *could* be done, but I don't think anybody *should* or even *would* do it, and to recommend it even as a possilbity seems irresponsible.
---
That's what I'm running into. Very little information out there on *farming* in raid spec. Do you know up mana shield instead? And if so, did you spec into the improved mana shield?
---
I'd probably use Atali if I had the patience to farm out an of the monkey pair, but I dont (and yet am closing in on finishing Breastplaye of Bloodthirst)
---
Also picked up gargoyle slashers and have been using them over Slaghide Whale and Devilsaur for my "standard" until I can get Slaghide Monkey/Bear/Defense
---
Go gnomish then goblin, as the goblin items can break and need to be remade, where as gnomish doesn‚Äôt. As far as what items, you only really need to go up to the death ray (240 maybe?) but could go higher for the gadgetzan teleport
---
Yeah but gold is selling for 430/1kgold. So $43/100g or $21.50/50g 
---
$21/hr is more than enough to make bot/Asian farming worth it.
---
The fact that Blizz won't ban these accounts astounds me. It violates tos and it's annoying as fuck. The same guy on my server sits in Northshire and slightly turns every few seconds to not go afk. Pretty sure it's a bot and I've reported him countless times. Still logs on every day, all day.
---
sorry... what are parses? i'm a mage, i don't get this. pls explain :\\
---
Good communication between you two. Though I am a bit sceptical about the ultimatum you wanted to give him,to join your guild if he wanted to roll on it. Why risk a perfectly functioning raid with a functioning agreement, by forcing him to give up his own guild name etc.? It seems there would be a risk of him getting frustrated and leaving after all.
---
My man!
---
Whats the price for 100g atm? On high pop eu realm
---
Good thing I'm not doing PvP or hardcore raiding and just mob grinding for fun, then. Basilisks are still dropping cold eyes without maximum efficiency, believe it or not.
---
I don't find druids that amazing tbh, compared to my priest I have more down-time and kill things slower. I am not even comparing with AOE levelling mages or locks.
---
get good goy
---
I agree, and I think it's pretty stupid to need/equip a BoE blue for a negligible stat boost then vendor it when you replace it with a green ~2 levels later, personally.
---
Fuck off back to retail
---
If you want death ray or battle chicken, go gnomish first. Everything else is BOE so you can get it from other engineers.
---
You will want to stay goblin eventually to make your own explosives.
---
I doubt they use the same account to sell gold as the account with the level 60 farmer.
---
You can still report them. You'll just get a grey chat message that someone tried to invite you. You can report that.
---
BUT IT DOESNT EFFECTIVELY ACT LIKE A TAUNT. IT JUST DOESNT.
---
EVERY SITUATION WHERE YOU ACTUALLY NEED TO USE TAUNT AS A WARRIOR, THIS WILL NOT WORK. 
---
This just generates alot of threat, its not going to overcome threat wipes, which is the primary use of taunt.
---
We‚Äôll hear this same argument a year from now lmao
---
Even before clashing with the other faction it looked unacceptable with all this glitching. 
---
As soon as the others join it's instantly unplayable.
---
Honestly, this is pathetic.
---
Read above. You misunderstood my meaning
---
Screenshots arent going to make the computer lag. You sound like my wife talking about how desktop icons will make it lag.
---
Shaman's Searing totem "Phatom Shot" bug?
---
I was leveling and the searing totem started shooting something... Something I definitely didn't want to aggro because I was recovering from the brink of death. I see the shot go off, it lands, and nothing happens. No damage, no aggro.
---
Has anyone experienced something similar anywhere?
---
Vanquisher's should be better.
---
I'm starting to think they lost the list of disallowed words and brands from before.  I've seen some crazy names lately..
---
What the fuck are faps
---
I don't think I've ever initiated combat by right clicking... isn't it simpler to tab target and press a key bind? Maybe not come to think of it but most classes will not be opening up with an auto attack.
---
I was just adding to your comment, not negating it.
---
IO is worse than ilvl addon was. I hated when they allows m+ to give loot, it forced you to run them constantly. They are fun and challenging but shouldnt be a requirement.
---
This is true and one of reasons why I rolled alliance this time around.  Orgrimmar isn't a good capital at all, and neither was hordes BFA city which was probably made by the same people.
---
This is why you don't stand there.
---
Song name?
---
Lol we just keep seeing Vendorstrike
---
And even if your bags are full, walk up to the corpse, open the loot window and walk away. That way at least the skinners can pick up the crap themselves, then skin it.
---
It's a stun https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=4068/iron-grenade
---
TBF its what you need to do with botters. LoL bans based on attitude while with botters you just get a new account and a new hack with what needs to be fixed. Banning in waves makes it not really known what needs to be fixed.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=4068/iron-grenade
---
It's a stun that incapacitates https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=4068/iron-grenade
---
i have an alt on one of the post-launch wave 3 realm names. mostly out of curiosity. 
---
its easily busier than anything in retail, even considering retail sharding. at worst, they'll be busier-than-vanilla average realms from back in the day.
---
Oh i see thanks for the info and maybe tone down the attitude a bit. Hugs!
---
Yeah but we haven't been there in like a decade, man. 
---
I need to see if it was really like I remember or if TeenFrodo was just bad at WoW.
---
Would hardly call that a "really nice" drop. If anything, the devs are Jerkin you around
---
I can read, yes. However, see this quote from the link in my previous post:
---
Incapacitate differs from¬†Stun¬†in that¬†Incapacitate¬†effects always break on damage, while Stun effects don't.¬†
---
According to everyone in the barrens alliance is for gay people who enjoy butt studf
---
I'm still trying to level my main at only 43.
---
I'm interested in doing that but don't know how to do it. Care to share any info?
---
Resto, Feral tank, balance (Princess farming), PvP, several trinkets and situational weapons.
---
Actually this is the first time I've seen boomer humor upvoted on Reddit in months. It's more normal to see someone comment "found the boomer" while the "joke" gets downvoted into oblivion. It's disappointing to see that classicwow is so backwards compared to the rest of the site. And that's saying something because Reddit can be a real cesspool sometimes. 
---
I'm also not sure why you think I'm getting worked up. Maybe that makes it easier for you to write off what I'm saying? I'm just pointing out that the jokes are dumb in the hopes that someone will see my comment and say "you know, this is stupid" and do better for themselves. I'm in a perfectly happy marriage; I'm done. I just want others to have what I already found :)
---
Honestly I like the world pvp during leveling, it brings a lot to the game. Being ganked for hours while being outnumbered 1 to 3 all the time is not.
---
Blizzard didn't start designing encounters for boss mods in mind until Wrath. Remember back in the day if you were progression raiding you did it without boss mods and with zero official information about boss abilities.
---
The only time you are really punishing yourself by not using boss mods are DPS checks with serious mechanics. Which don't exist in vanilla.
---
There are a very small number of exceptions -&gt; BRD cannot be done with more than 5, and I think there is another as well.
---
Cool ttyl
---
"Only if you include pummelers" thats like player a warrior without mongoose and rage pots
---
Why would you go to a raid without your consumables? As a feral you should be going to a raid with pummelers.
---
Yes. My +sp set (mostly pre-bis) for dungeons/raids, and my eagle set (int/stam) for farming.
---
***WITNESS ME SENPAI***
---
For Horde, on Alliance they have to go to BRD first
---
Yeah, twinks are a different story but I'd bet most of the BiS twink gear is going to sell for so much that people won't let you have it either way, though.
---
I'd seek some input from someone knowledgeable about fury warriors, too though just in case. This is purely a Rogue perspective.
---
You can also kill for no Honor, let him/her revive and kill again, but this time for Honor!
---
Lesser Magic Wands
---
The ability actuslly gives rage on both yellow and white crits, so its even better with MCP.
---
That's funny.
---
You're right, I can think of several fights that are dps checks, and several fights that are mechanic heavy, but none that are both. Interesting.
---
Lol now we are getting somewhere
---
Thanks for this!
---
You're right I meant that less in a literal sense and more in the there's absolutely no combination of words you can string together that will convince me that what I'm saying isn't a fact.
---
Better than sitting down and drinking for 30 seconds
---
That's when you reply with "Your wife? I think you mean your wife's boyfriend" And then leave the group. Works best if you are heals or a tank.
---
As a Horde player you'd need a full run of LBRS (Omokk, Voone and Wyrmthalak kill + Loot some documents located at either of those 3 bosses or at Urok Doomhowl (where he is summoned)), 2 runs to UBRS (runs to Rend is sufficient), then kill 4 dragons spread around Azeroth (Winterspring, Tanaris, and Swamp of Sorrows, followed by a new quest for a dragon in Wetlands). Lastly you head back to UBRS for a full run.
---
LBRS once, UBRS thrice.
---
70g? 150g? 300g? you mean 4g?
---
Well, I love it how different people quote different prices! servers, haha.
---
Now that said, I don't see a problem with him rolling need. If you roll greed you shouldn't complain about other people needing it. It just meant you didn't want the item that much.
---
Anytime they roll need on a recipe/pattern and don‚Äôt immediately train it
---
Had it happen last night in Scholo on moon cloth bag , quick 80g for the warlock.  didn‚Äôt say anything about it/rationalize, but never trained it either
---
But you can't use the gadget teleport if you then switch to goblin, because the trinket actually requires gnomish to use, no?
---
Tbh  I didn't think your comment was serious.   Sorry
---
They are bots so most likely crawling thru player names. Maybe his is Bob and yours is Rakizhaithnaklpoezzzifran
---
Man those Orc animations, my hats off to you. I never had a female Undead character before so that alone has had me glued to the lock...
---
But I 100% feel you on the lock/mage comparison. I‚Äôm only so many hours into my lock and already the soul shard bit is driving me crazy. Not too different than all the crap I need to carry on my rogue.
---
Mage is so easy in that regard. Apart from runes for teleporting, my bags are so much easier to manage.
---
Did you click the link? It has it's own mechanic. It basically applies a stun that incapacitates.
---
Just make friends with anyone doing the same things as you, or hell even if you like their name let them know! I saw a warrior named "halfdan" on my server, so whispered "Whats up my viking bro?" And he absolutely lost it over the fact I was the first person to even mention that its a real viking name. Now whenever we pass each other in the world we say whats up ask if either needs help with anything and move on! I made another friend just by accidentally paying them to take my cloth rather than COD'ing it to them and Mr niceguy actually sent me my gold back, needless to say thats the homie for sure now. You can make in game friends in many different ways!
---
I see people say it doesn‚Äôt work well in dungeons. If you had a group composition of Paladin Tank, any 3 same DPS and a healer would you generate more threat that traditional Prot rotation?
---
Ah ok, never played alliance
---
are gold sellers still predominantly chinese? and is it just bots or are there actual people in those channels? I can think of a few auto reply macros with news about eg genocide in China, preferably in chinese.
---
It's a pain to have to key in the reason every time. I've just started leaving it blank and hoping they can do the math.
---
With that information, I would say that the grenades are not a stun, but an incapacitate, in the similar manner as the rogue ability, gouge. The only argument Domillimew could have is that the information on wowhead is not accurate. If that is the case, I would ask his source, so that we can confirm it. And personal experience is not a source.
---
yeah, nope.
---
how much does a mage tome cost? 10 silver?
---
The quest reward is so unbelievably sh1t that nobody wants it.
---
If the email you provided is working, and sheets doesnt bug out, then you should get both.  Thats assuming that you got a reply stating that you should get it in a moment, i might also miss stuff as the message flow is quite eh substantial!
---
1) email invite
---
2) it should be available as a shared doc on your drive
---
I don't bother with SPY and I do fine on PVP servers.
---
Also, I'm sure if you mention that youre new and dont know everything about the game you will be taught all sort of stuff by people in your groups!
---
Uh you need to search for classic simulationcraft, there's been a post somewhere about it but I don't remember the details. Don't play DPS so I never bothered to research it, but I heard the interface isn't exactly intuitive (though the normal simcraft wasn't too bad).
---
I clicked it and I neglected to scroll down. Damn, these grenades are a wonky business!
---
Am I just crazy, or was the tooltip (in some later patch or exp) changed to instead say "incapacitated"?
---
Yes. Almost all of them
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Instances_by_level
---
What did I try to explain? Once again l2read
---
&gt;Apply Aura: Stun
---
Value: 2
---
Mechanic: Incapacitated
---
Maybe? Honestly it's both. Somehow.
---
I, for one, welcome our new trailer park meme overlords.
---
Pickpocket is a spell you can use in stealth, it it works you stay in stealth and loot a small amount of money and sometimes items or junkbox that you can eventually unlock with your lockpicking skill.
---
If they resist(meaning the action failed), then you'll be brought out of stealth.
---
It's a stun that applies incapacitate.https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=4068/iron-grenade
---
Yea, that box never seems to have any useful info. I just moved it way to the edge of my ultra wide monitor and forget about it to be honest
---
They seem to be about the same from what I've seen on the login screen, both still hitting full during peak hours. I think ZT is a bit of an odd one out though.
---
definitely gonna do this on my rogue alt
---
Necropile set from Scholo is great for farming.
---
Potions/elixirs and the flowers to make the good ones are one of the few things that keep or go up in value as an expansion goes on past the first raid.
---
Are you talking about solo mage farming?
---
Yeah, it's not for everybody. Most people make the mistake of trying to take out yellow mobs. You really want to farm greens, because a single resist is enough to ruin a good time.
---
Group AoE farming is incredibly easy, however. Cath and ZF runs are a great source of income and XP.
---
Yeh but its classic. For years people successfully played this game on 1-9 and way before mice with a gazillion buttons were released.
---
can't they download more RAM
---
thought this was not an actual bug but was working as intended
---
Not all, but most. Anything up to dm or so.
---
cos its not a stun
---
Prices for Coarse Stone have been crazy on my server, I sold a ton of stacks for 5g each. That's a ridiculously easy way to make money when you're only level 30. You come across plenty of Iron Ore if you're looking for Tin, and the Iron sells pretty well too.
---
I also sold about 50 Deadly Blunderbuss for 1g each.
---
Pally tanking is great for dungeons, and I can't imagine you are planning on main tanking on an alt. You can stick with the spec to heal raids and still off tank some things. You need a lot of niche gear which makes gearing up pretty easy and interesting. You get to be the manly plate wearer paladins were meant to be.
---
Yepp, It cost me very little and it's just because it's a fun thing to do and better than Luffa (we're only lvl 56 atm and she haven't found better trinkets).
---
Like others said, just anything that you're curious about. Maybe you read something in a quest, maybe you found something interesting in a dungeon, maybe you saw a funny YouTube video.
---
You can't strike up conversations with anyone, because not everyone is into that or good at it, but that shouldn't be a reason not to try. üòâ
---
Send me a pm if you want to exchange character info so we can talk ingame.
---
Shift+B is the default bind to open all bags if you don't wanna change binds.
---
The primary reason I would be tempted to keep it in guild, is if they aren't committed enough to the raid to even join guild, then how committed are they to running with us every week?
---
If I only cared about what people did during this one raid, then I would simply pug raids every week. But instead, we run raids as a guild, or in this case an alliance of guilds, to build consistency, reliability, and a network of skilled players.
---
And the point of my story is that I was able to overcome (at least in part) my personal bias against someone unwilling to join my guild, and the result was fantastic.
---
Here‚Äôs the thing though - how is a typical WoW player supposed to know the difference? Anyone new to classic will have zero idea what‚Äôs got a huge AH market and what doesn‚Äôt.
---
That‚Äôs the base way the game was intended to be played...but then after years of playing people got addons for AH gold, figured out exactly what mobs dropped what loot and how much each piece of loot was worth, and it just became a cold calculated numbers game.
---
Rather than running a dungeon and seeing what exciting item drops to buff your character, you‚Äôre grinding a dungeon over and over hoping for the 3.7% drop rate of item X comes from mob Y and let down when it doesn‚Äôt...when cool stuff drops for someone, you don‚Äôt get excited for your character to get great new gear, you just see dollar signs for how much people will pay you for it.
---
It just fees like people have datamined this game to pieces and have lost some of the adventure that made it fun in the first place. That‚Äôs fine and totally makes sense though - many have been playing virtually the same game for 14 years so of course the adventuresome aspects will wear off.
---
Really? i mean that boss was *melting* they dont really need to watch their threat... even if the mage here didn't get punted out and just got mauled the boss would probably have been dead within seconds of the mage..
---
The only Addon I truly wish didn‚Äôt exist is spy
---
Depends on location. Where i live, the sky looks like that every summer evening.
---
Mograine is kind of an unique case of a server from what i seen so far. Its filled with PVE tryhards like gehennas, but not tryhard enough to play 24/7 like gehennas. If you look at classic logs for example there are many guilds and players ranked top 10 globally, but everyone is just raidlogging from major guilds. 
---
Stormwind during wednesday ony buff times have easily more than 500 players in it stacked in one layer, 3 hours later everyone is gone. I think it will be a lot better once honor releases.
---
Inb4 the flood of salt
---
Finding a raiding guild that doesn't care if you use DBM in Classic is easy. Any good raid leader will be calling the few mechanics that matter anyway. Having DBM display warnings doesn't stop DPS getting meter fixated.
---
Was raiding molten core the other daaaaayyyyyyyy
---
It's easier to explain this way :
---
Imagine there are 3 separate stun categories that have DR with themselves, but not with the other categories.
---
One group is controlled stuns, like cheap shot, charge or hammer of justice.
---
The second group is random proc stuns like mace spec. or item procs.
---
The third group is kidney shot all by itself.
---
And yet I still hear about guilds that have wiped on Lucifron lol
---
Yeah you can't, no point going for it.
---
You can definitely be banned for using an add-on that violates ToS.
---
There are addons that perform more than one action with a keypress, or perform automated actions. These are both violations of the ToS and are potentially bannable.
---
I'm a holy priest trying to get into raids to heal. For the raids so far (UBRS and a pug Ony raid), it seems like there's no communication in regards to who the healers should be healing. Also, for my Ony raid, they lumped dps together into 5-man groups and put all the healers together in one/two groups; I feel like this negates Prayer of Healing since it's a party-wide only AOE heal (feel free to correct me if i'm wrong). My questions are: should I just be healing whoever gets low (whether it be MT/OT or DPS) in general? In an organized raid group, is there usually communication on which healer takes care of which people (i.e. one healer takes care of group 1, next one takes care of group 2, etc.)? Thank you in advance.
---
Yeah I would agree with that
---
As if slowfall was required... that drop is easily survivable. Take off your tinfoil hat.
---
I still get the invites in my chat log and they still annoy me :/
---
Username checks out?
---
I honestly can't imagine not binding anything. Though, I'm forced to. My action bars are full  so I have to click some of my potions. Feelsbadman. I am left handed though so clicking things with my right handed mouse feels very unnatural.
---
He, and every other boss in that horrible place, just loves the ‚Äòstun the tank and drop aggro lol‚Äô trick.
---
engineering purely for pvp
---
Eskhandars hand is a purple. 
---
MS is a blue. 
---
Case closed.
---
Someone already has 13k Gold, a Youtuber called Frost...
---
I get thise at least twice a day in Ashbringer-Eu
---
thankfully it is a bannable offense, if multiple people report you for it.
---
The .5 sets were a sort of catch up mechanic when AQ came out. Those world pvp objectives also released with AQ. It‚Äôs staying true to the actual vanilla timeline. Whether that‚Äôs smart or not isn‚Äôt something I can say. I really wish bg‚Äôs would all come out soon.
---
Haha yeah they are!! Not sure on the change... but, if they did it's important to note we are already on 1.12 or w/e
---
Technically the shield off Rag is BIS.
---
The higher level is not that important in classic. Spells etc rarely get resistet. 2 warriors are also easy cake for mage / priest. Also: it‚Äôs not too late to reroll on pve, p2 will be hell for you if you don‚Äôt like pvp
---
Are there different types of Maraudon runs?
---
If you see a group advertising a Princess run, do you need the scepter to join it?
---
If you don‚Äôt have the scepter yet what is the best way to get it? Join a Mara full clear run?
---
When set on defensive?
---
When Blizzard bans an account for gold-selling, I'm pretty sure they can also trace the source of the gold, AKA the level 60 farmer.
---
Username checks out
---
So you‚Äôre saying you‚Äôd genuinely prefer for the game to do away with loot drops and just give out gold stacks to people, then there be shops at the towns you just go buy whatever you need?
---
 Saw someone with over 800 runs. Congrats!
---
Yeah...he was the only one that needed it...did you look at the screenshot?
---
There's a reason I didn't give the ultimatum. I put that in this story merely to try and explain how my brain instantly went to the negative in this scenario. I have experienced my fair share of drama over loot, and I really enjoyed tanking with this guy, and I didn't want to have this conversation. And as I thought about it, naturally I assumed the worst.
---
The important part of the story was that despite my poor assumptions, I went into it diplomatically and with as open a mind as I could, and I was rewarded. I have even more respect for the guy, and he respects me more, and it brought us closer together.
---
Had I led with the ultimatum and just said "this is how its going to be", then I very much doubt the conversation would have ended well. Its why I didn't do it. But did I think about it? Yes. And if anyone in a similar situation says that the thought didn't even cross their mind, then they are lying. There is a very big difference between thinking something, and acting on it.
---
people generally are more willing to spend some time in communicating, which leads to less asshole interactions.
---
You‚Äôre right!
---
Fashionable 24h late. 
---
Sorry, my memory isn't the best.
---
But better late than forever left haunting in google searches.
---
I admit I didn't come up with this myself, but found yet another guide and followed that one:

This results wow being used by 1.5 screens. leaving one half for discord or whatever you want. But it can also easily changed to use 2 full screens.

Sunn - Viewport Art didin't work for me so instead i used addon called CTMod that has same viewport option for making that empty area

Yikes these keybinds
---
Someone just said this to me the other day, but I had just finished buying epic mount and Powerleveling first aid and alchemy which broke the bank!
---
hmmm, I play with 1-5, q, e, r, t, f, g, c, v and then all of those can be with Sift and Ctrl  
---
That's more than enough for any class.
---
I made 1.2k in a week. It took 3 weeks to get a good Pre-Raid BIS set.
---
But if an item has a high chance of dropping, i have to believe its AH value is far lower than an item that has a low chance of dropping, so that balances out.
---
&lt;3
---
Can you name such addons or a case when someone got banned for using one? They've been actively changing their API to prevent such addons from functioning, instead of actioning players that use tools provided for them.
---
Aside from cross faction translation addons, I suppose.
---
Yes, in an organized raid there will typically be 2 healers each assigned to the main tank / off tank, as well as assigned raid healers (usually shamans).  
---
As for the groups, I've generally seen it as a healer with 4 DPS instead of stacking all the healers in one group.  I think this is more of a raid leader preference thing however.
---
Its there. When i start the game and click on "Addons" its there too and checked to load
---
I like how humans look in basically all gear but there's no variety. I'm never gonna want to roll a nelf/gnome/dwarf. I'm also much more used to the horde leveling experience. Cities wise ironforge is definitely one of the best cities in game.
---
I tried solo Incendius farm as mage. Vids don't show all the learning curve but I did it and after I just got other classes to farm together quicker. AoE - sometimes I use it but likely never to explicitly as leveling/farming method. Sometimes I pull a pack or two of satyrs and then AoE them down, more so on elementals in silithus when I was farming missing Hydraxian rep. Due to slow applying at \~second blizzard tick (plus leeway if you aren't careful) it's harder than on pservers. Curious how solo mages will do vs 100 undead mobs when scourge invasions will be up. Statistically 1 mob will resist frost nova ;)
---
This is confusing. Did they ask you if you needed it or if you'd help them?
---
What does lark mean?
---
There is not a single Horde player model I enjoy, bunch of hunched over disgusting mofos. Never been a time (even in retail) where I‚Äôve played a horde character (for the purpose of playing with friends) and been happy with how I look. When I play horde I play Druid.
---
Horde also live in a bunch of low class mud huts while the Alliance gets the glory of IronForge and Stormwind.
---
Paladins!
---
That godforsaken place.  I don‚Äôt even want to go there to complete my quests, yet I do it twice for every toon...
---
Oh now that you mention it, I think that's actually the addon I was referring to. Got them mixed up.
---
I kinda regret making my mage a gnome and my warlock a human.
---
If i had gone the other way around i wouldnt have to deal with an annoying/fugly robo-chicken until i get my rogue up (thats a long time out).
---
Just went to Ashenvale yesterday on it to try to get a *bit* of rep to make the runecloth turn-ins better eventually.  Still not looking forward to dropping ~500g on it, though &gt;.&lt;
---
Which, I‚Äôm pretty sure you shouldn‚Äôt bother aiming for? Go check out skarms videos on YouTube maybe. I think he talks about it some. In vanilla, that was the stat that tanks went for first. 440. But I believe that it‚Äôs no longer the end all be all because you can‚Äôt be crushed with shield block up. So it‚Äôs incredibly unlikely to be crushed more than once consecutively. Take all this with a grain of salt though, because while I am a tank, I‚Äôm not a main tank of a guild clearing MC  on farm yet.
---
Or.. most normal people
---
Game is part of your hobbies, isn't it? You don't do it because you have to, you are not doing it for money, you do it because you like it and it's entertaining. It's your call how you spend free time, don't expect to be better at game or more wealthier if you aren't spending time on it. You can't have everything, deal with it.
---
Atleast 1 an hour on bleameux
---
&gt;Group AoE farming is incredibly easy, however. Cath and ZF runs are a great source of income and XP.
---
try to heal those monkeys and you will change your mind
---
ppl doing "spellcleave farming" often dont know their class well enough and cant solo aoe farm because of that so they group up and the clowfiesta begins
---
joining few such groups made me avoid mages at all cost, ppl should first learn to play, then jump into more advanced stuff
---
The more I read into this the less certain I am on the discussion. The defense cap is 440 for level 60, which is unreachable with current gearing.
---
Truth
---
BRD is a solid 3 hours. Most of the others are around half that depending on your group. I'd give yourself at least an hour and a half per dungeon clear. UNLESS it's just runs of something quick. For example an arena/angerforge/golem run in BRD should only take 10-15 minutes depending on the tank and group. The DM wings tend to be faster, usually 30-45 minutes per depending on what bosses people need, as you can skip a boss or 2 in almost every wing.
---
Scholo depends as well. Most groups skip Jandice and Vectus, however if you're in a group that wants Jandice it can add an extra 15-20 or so minutes on to the run. In my experience Scholo is around  an hour though depending on the group.
---
Strat live I wanna say is around an hour . I personally haven't done UD strat but I believe its slightly faster than live. I might be wrong about that though.
---
You have a keyboard with over 100 keys?
---
Cath runs can give good xp and go fast at the same time?
---
The necropile set from scholo seems pretty decent for this. I was going to get it but then I ended up getting some raid pieces that had a ton of int and Stam on them anyway
---
No matter what, WoW will stay with TCP (even nost had to), which is dumb af from a networking perspective.
---
Anyway of doing money with a Paladin later on? Just rolled one, I don't mind the auto attacks for now
---
And I'm pretty sure there's no way to solo wpvp with them, maybe later on in other phases  with specifics build?
---
+1 for the 'all need if it's a really valuable item, otherwise greed' camp.
---
Yes, basically three runs - Purple/Orange/Princess.  Purple and Orange are basically full clears.
---
You do not need a scepter to do princess runs, only 1 person in the group does.
---
Best way to get it, join a purple/orange run and ask specifically to do the scepter q.
---
Yeah it fucking blows my mind.  
---
I currently have all purple parses in a guild where everybody else green parses for the most part.  And I don't take it to mean anything other than "Wow, I must have crit my Aimed Shots pretty well this week and spent an extra 30g on consumables".  
---
Parses in vanilla are almost a direct correlation to the speed at which you can kill the boss and the  amount of gold / time you're willing to spend getting buffs.  
---
I understand the desire to be competitive and make things interesting.  But it's Classic WoW, go get good at a game that benefits from that mentality.  Playing optimally might even be a timewaste...for example: Farming Dire Maul buffs, random world buffs, and the 20-30g for Elixir of Mongoose, Mana Pots, etc takes about the same time, if not more, than the extra hour or so spent in MC.
---
That is how it works in harder content.
---
However current content is very easy so you just do whatever until Ragnaros pops and gives you epics.
---
Yeah the only time ive done that is when i was bored and ran some lowbies through SFK as a mid 50s warlock (not as much of a faceroll as i expected when low on shards and you dont have a lvl appropriate healer to be your health battery, but still much faster than them doing it themselves).
---
Told them id be need rolling on any boes if they dropped, and they were fine with that. It never came up, but at least i had some reasonable leverage for my request. Though i will say at least the Stockades Lock put his request upfront and let you guys decide if it was a dealbreaker, rather than just rolling on it and telling you after the fact and hoping itd be too much of a pita to replace mid run.
---
Area52 is a Horde server like Illidan. I don‚Äôt understand how you‚Äôre playing Alliance on A52. It‚Äôs like playing Horde on Sargeras.
---
You have to be a real masochist to do this 800 times for a +8 spell damage upgrade.
---
This is a really good point. I think most people who expect prices to go up dramatically are basing that assumption on the fact that's what happened in Vanilla. 
---
**However**, Vanilla steadily saw an **increase** in its player base as the game progressed and grew.  With Classic, it is more likely that the player base will **decrease** as expansions come out/time continues, because most people playing classic were already into it to start. I don't think it's fair to assume it is drawing a larger customer base each month.
---
Oh I didn‚Äôt know that lol. I admittedly (and obviously) suck a PvP and don‚Äôt know much. 
---
But I was mostly just being sarcastic through the video about being on a PvP server. I actually really enjoy it. Definitely gives more immersion.
---
Gear: 15 slots: My Offspec Dps set(Feral cat), 10 slots of Fire Resist gear for ragnaros and Baron Geddon.
---
Consumables: Reagents(2slots, Gift of the Wild &amp; Rebirth), Food buff 2 stacks of 12 Stamina food. 3 stacks of Rumsy Rum(30 in total), 10 slots of Elixirs(Superior Defense, Mongoose, Fortitude, Brute Force, Mighty Troll's Blood) two stacks of each type of elixir, 6 slots Potions(Magic Resistance, GFPP &amp; Greater Stoneshield) also two stacks of each. 2slots Mana Regen items(Major Mana Potion &amp; Demonic/Dark Runes)
---
This is a total of 50 slots. Then after this i have things like Aqual Quintessence, Mount, enchanting rods and a few other random items i cant throw into the bank or send off to an alt. Whatever left i have i fill with Manual Crowd Pummelers. I normally bring 13+ atleast every raid.
---
First of all - don't use PoH. On Onyxia there's a lot of running around, people don't stay together.  
---
Check wowclassic logs - 90% of all Priest healing done with Flash Heal.
---
Second - lump all DPS together is a mistake from Raid Leader. You should be healing your group, and only helping in another group if someone dangerously low.  
---
If your raid doesn't have dedicated MT healer - then it's just badly organized raid.  
---
Usually you are only responsible for your group.
---
oh boy are you in for a surprise
---
BIS is a 1% upgrade from other blues.
---
Onyxia's head is raid gear, not pre-BIS.
---
If you think your BiS is reserved without saying a word, you are the problem and are going to find yourself kicked from groups with that shitty attitude.
---
What‚Äôs a reasonable tip for box unlocks? Never really sure what they are actually expecting.
---
How can you simulate it?
---
I believe only person needs it for Princess run. If you don't have it, or just want to complete all your quests, look for a full (sometimes called quest) run. Reserve 2.5-3 hours for it, doing all the wings can take some time - especially if you wipe a time or two.
---
It'll seriously make zero difference in the effectiveness of nearly every hardcore raiding mage if they click or press the frostbolt key. (or the Flash of Light key for de holy Paladins...)
---
My guild ran ZF with 8 players, apparently it granted great exp/h
---
r/wooooosh
---
Look up simulationcraft, there's a classic version available.
---
I rather spend a Week in ZF, then months trying to get a Mageblade.
---
Yeah that seems right-ish. BRD 3+h though definitely involves wipes. You should be able to clear it entirely in 3h.
---
Tbh I don‚Äôt have much empathy for a random person in game. I know nothing about them. I don‚Äôt go out of my way to be a dick but I also am not here to ‚Äúmake their day‚Äù.
---
Anyways boe in pugs is need. Simple
---
Equip the new peice and sell your old one, get two birds stoned at once
---
Reed is literally one of the easiest farms in the game though. The drop-rate isn't bad at all and the rest of UBRS loot has a lot of pre-bis for melee, meaning that casters are usually the minority in groups.
---
&gt; and are potentially bannable.
---
Addons - yes. People who use it - not.
---
I have done MC 20 times now, i havent gotten a single piece of loot :( at this point im waiting for BWL and PVP gear
---
Mostly just princess runs and full runs. You shouldn‚Äôt need scepter to join a princess run as the leader should have it themselves. only 1 person needs the scepter as anyone in the group can use the portal it opens, just tell them to wait for you so you can use the portal. 
---
If you want scepter yourself you can get it pretty easily by grabbing the quest from the dryad outside orange side. Then clear orange side and loot the water elemental boss, get the group to run over through green section to purple side to kill the satyr boss and loot him. Then clear up to celebras and turn in the quest to him after you kill him, follow the RP and you‚Äôll have the scepter.
---
Hey settle down ok?
---
Oh thats such a good song
---
Ah, and I've never played Horde but it makes perfect sense that you will not be talking to Marshal Windsor at BRD as a horde player for the attunment quest.
---
It was actually a debate they had back in the day. DPS check + mechanic heavy basically required boss mods, which Blizz didn't want to make mandatory. In the end they decided they wanted to design more complex encounters so started designing with boss mods factored in. And these days in retail you have the dungeon guide telling you all about a bosses abilities and people don't have to try and work it out while pushing progression. Meanwhile my guild is still debating how Ony works.
---
The people here are not uptight - the title of the post is just misleading as many people here explained
---
You mean the shield with int and mp5? lol
---
Anyone else make some fun pumpkins?
---
It's 100% better than Draconian, but if you're "min/maxing" and playing deep-prot, the Shield off Rag is technically BiS. It's definitely an upgrade, but will be replaced when the Shield off Chromaggus drops, as that will be BiS until Naxx.
---
Not sure if Ragnaros, or if you are Scooby Doo.
---
People keep saying this and it may be fine  for MC and maybe even BWL but come AQ40 and Naxx a crush can 1 shot a tank and wipe the raid. It's not that hard to get 440 and still have great threat once in mostly epics.
---
Confused you with the op. He was long winded and convoluted.
---
Didn't say it was. Was just adding some trivia.
---
glad I could help. Let me know if you have any issues and I'll try and help you work them out.
---
No, they will fear it.
---
It's a 5 out of 7.
---
standard US keyboard has 101 keys ;)
---
Yeah Westfall here too... got 3 of them while running RFC the other night before my tank showed me how to turn them off
---
I was the druid here. I was a nice 4 xp from 60 so I thought of the idea of discovering the starting area to ding, so I RP walked thru the gate. Turns out the starting areas dont give xp so I just mounted and started going regularly towards the quest to try that out. Was like an hour after I wanted to go to bed but I had to hit 60 so I stayed up, but I just wanted to be done at that point
---
Well, listening to this now.

It is connected (merged in everything but names) to Sen'jin and Un'goro.
---
What is the resolution on this?  I would really like to use it as my PC background (if ya don't mind).
---
Faded photograph and shit I want to auction but cant be bothered
---
Being better than prebis doesn't make something a "good tank weapon" in my eyes. Every 1 hand weapon in raid is a "good tank weapon" by that definition. 
---
Brut Blade isnt going to last you any longer than quel really  and on any other race than human id rather a dagger or a claw out of MC. I see why you're calling it good but I just disagree
---
Ele/Resto 4 lyfe.
---
Honestly I'm really torn on the whole Mp5 debate. I've been going back and forth over it with my ex-shammy healer guildie for a long time. There's so many ifs involved.
---
Pets just take up inventory, and I rarely even notice them being out.
---
This!
---
Picture this we were both buck naked, banging on the bathroom floor
---
Orgrimmar could have been like Stormwind but Thrall actually pays his builders.
---
No damage or aggro sounds like the attack didn't go off. Maybe connectivity issue?
---
What happens if you accept those??
---
I mean, I did no fewer than 20 zombie runs last week as a Paladin, and an eye-bleeding number of Cath runs in my early 40's.
---
Outside of bubbling the occasional player that mistimed a blink, they're pretty foolproof with at least three mages.
---
What I‚Äôm doing is just skipping 3/3 frostbite and going 3/3 improved blizzard instead. Can still take 5/5 ice shards and 5/5 shatter with 3/3 cone of cold and even go 17 Arcane for improved counter spell. All you really miss from the standard PvP Build is frostbite which sucks but with 3/3 permafrost and improved blizzard it allows you to aoe farm. When BGs drop and I‚Äôm done farming my epic mount I may just spec full PvP.
---
I would love a link too, please!
---
When was I complaining? I‚Äôm saying to a casual, farming for 10-20 hours can be very bland and they likely won‚Äôt be making 25/g an hour anyway.
---
this is how I do it and am lvl 52 now ... VW is just really bad in my opinion just has no dmg and no threat ..
---
succ is way better for lvling - if you start with dots the succ will hold aggro just long enough for the immolate cast to go through uninterupted then tank with drain life ... after the kill life tap and darkpact keeps the mana constantly up with nearly 0 downtimes ... if you actually run out of mana life tap more and bandage .. 
---
improved drain soul isnt really worth it in my opinion if the other sustain option is way better - at least for solo non endgame
---
Not trying to defend Blizzard but I've been playing on Deviate Delight with a 9 year old macbook pro and I haven't run into major lag problems. Most of the world pvp engagements have been closer to 30vs30 though, and we aren't dealing with multi-hour queues and layering. 
---
That doesn't take away from the fact that the high pop servers are seeing unplayable amounts of lag for these larger pvp events. If phase 2 is supposed to introduce honor kills with no battlegrounds it is just going to get worse. 
---
It is super frustrating but as long as we're all paying our subscription Blizzard doesn't really care if people are mad on reddit.
---
You really needed to post the actually question. Sounds like one of you misinterpreted something. Like the other person was asking if you'd help do pyron and your response was 'I dont need'. In which case I'd have been annoyed as well. Though I wouldn't go all emo child with my response.
---
you're unable to switch from gnomish to goblin or vice-versa, you'd literally have to unlearn and re-skill it
---
Alliance will be wondering where the rest of the horde is hiding in case they need to gank. Horde never attack alone.
---
Was the guys name Atomized?
---
DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE HELL THAT IS MECHANO-STRIDERS. 
---
I just want to be a gnome on a tiger, is that so hard?
---
Except almost no one uses it with any consistency. I‚Äôve seen it used for throws, pushes, pulls, and drops, with and without any particular level of force or emotion. It‚Äôs a meaningless buzzword coined for no apparent purpose.
---
Especially since the word ‚Äúhurl‚Äù already exists.
---
If I open all, or auto loot mail, will it take CODs too or will it prompt me?
---
The point is preparation is not cheating...your point is it‚Äôs cheating. Gathering readily available data approved by the game developers to benefit the group as a whole is not cheating. Not doing so because you don‚Äôt like it is selfish...especially because you can easily disable it when it‚Äôs not necessary.
---
Had never heard of that - awesome thanks a lot!
---
Here‚Äôs a thought: make a decision. Not to sounds mean but what do you like most??? If it‚Äôs all of the above then cycle through then I guess. Classic WoW is punishing the more alts you have if you want to focus on progression. If not, it doesn‚Äôt matter just have fun. Need groups? Be a tank. ....if you like it and it‚Äôs fun. Nobody can answer this question really but your last sentence is the most telling:  DPS caster. Want me to pick for you? Be a mage. Best class in the game.
---
what are the naxx blues?
---
I heard there are some welfare "blues" (it became epics later on i guess) that is said to be easier to get that we get in P1 despite being suppoed to be added in 1.11.0, but I checked the old patch notes and saw nothing.
---
what were they?
---
It doesn‚Äôt eliminate ninjas it just creates more, and that‚Äôs a greedy excuse to be a ninja. BiS drops and one ninja rolls, the warrior has a 50/50 chance. Now you decide you‚Äôre going to roll need too, the warrior gets a 33% chance to get his BiS.
---
You cut into his chances for an item for money. That‚Äôs greed and you‚Äôre a ninja. Unless you announce at the beginning of the run, you don‚Äôt make the rule up when something valuable you don‚Äôt need drops.
---
Ideally, farming is best done as deep frost with points into Cone of Cold and Improved blizzard.  Raiding Spec is Arcane/Frost.  The gear helps a lot, but the spec is wildly different.  I envy the Winter‚Äôs Chill mage in my guild sometimes.  He doesn‚Äôt top the meters but he does have a really easy time farming by comparison.  There are times I wish I had improved Blizzard.  Depending on the spec you‚Äôre using, which in my opinion, is the biggest factor, if you‚Äôre a deep frost mage, I would recommend a stat set with high int and stam.  As an Arcane/Frost mage, I do not because I simply lack the tools to farm mass mobs solo as well as a deep frost mage.
---
You can. I mostly kept track in my head.
---
I get them every half hour on Faerlina (US), happens mid fight sometimes completely distracting me
---
Depends on what you mean by fast.
---
If you get a group that doesn't care about drops, it's way faster just to skip all the bosses. Much better XP/hour.
---
Is it worth reporting these people or will they just make new accounts?
---
People do a great job answering your question about timing, but neglect to discuss levels.  If you're a healer, you can get by with being about 2 levels lower than these rough guidelines:
---
BRD to bar:  53
---
BRD to emp:  56
---
Scholo/Strat/LBRS:  57ish
---
UBRS:  58
---
DM East:  55
---
DM West:  56
---
DM North:  58
---
That‚Äôs assuming ‚Äúgold sellers‚Äù are one man teams with 0 expenses. The $21 hour is much less after overhead expenses and other people are paid. Just FYI
---
You need 6% with an axe.  Don't worry about getting 9% until you find a new weapon, though it wouldnt be terrible to start collecting a few pieces you might need.
---
In the future use the daily questions thread instead of posting a new thread.
---
I dislike how every horde race except orcs have their armor destroying by body feature, I always play orc when I play horde because of this &lt;.&lt;
---
440 defense pushes crushing blows off the hit table.
---
That is true.  I just like to give my pet a second to grab aggro, especially at the levels right before a new growl rank becomes available like 29, 39.  Growl is not as effective until the new rank is available at 30, 40, etc.
---
I had never played wow before, and I'm now 1 month in (Heal druid 46, Human Rogue 36). I'm really surprised by the lack of mid-range stuff that you can equip. I just want to find items with agility and even on wowhead there's like only 2 or 3 choices, and out of all these it is not rare that none of them is in the broker. My druid still has a lvl 17 piece of stuff because I can't find anything else that gives mp5...
---
It's also sad to see instance ring/armor drops  with only 2nd-tier stat. Like who would drop a 2 handed mace that gives 20 STR with displayed DPS at 38 for a 2 handed mace that has 38 DPS but 16 Spirit and 17 stamina. I mean yeah sure I need those stats, but not if I have to lose 20 of my main stat for it.
---
6% after that pump crit
---
Another thunder strike that nobody will roll on 
---
‚ÄúI am not wasting DKP on that piece of crap‚Äù
---
Stories like these comes from conflict. The conflict here is limited resources. The beauty of Vanilla (and a few expansions, depending on your threshold), is how you have to fight the land, AND the other players. You are not adventuring in your own adventure bubble where nothing can harm you, or annoy you for any lengthy period of time. 
---
It's also why there is a greater sense of accomplishment in vanilla, because everything is more fought after.
---
Let's say I (a scammer) offered to trade my Enigma (6 space item) for your 7 high runes or whatever, I'm not sure, just something that you are offering that would occupy more than 6 inventory slots. I put up the Enigma in the trade window and you put up your offer. We "attempt" to trade, I says it fails and I say 1 sec inventory is full, then cancel the trade. Act like I'm going to my stash and clearing some space. We trade again, you put your offer back in the window, I put in the exact same looking model of armor base hoping you don't check it and accept the trade.
---
Orc craftsmanship is limited to tying things to sticks.
---
Spoiler: Thrall ditches you and leaves the horde with a revolving door of bad guy leaders
---
I know man its horrible üòÇ
---
No, it doesn‚Äôt. Shield block pushes crushing blows off the crit table.
---
I got a Freezing Band off a turtle in the hinterlands the day after whining to a friend because he dropped a Warden Staff. The moral of this story is keep berating your lucky friends, I guess.
---
Sold it for 500g, fair price.
---
It‚Äôs a warlock from APES
---
same here.
---
No you‚Äôll always have ppl who fixate in their numbers but if you‚Äôve ever lead a raid group it does get annoying having to say the same things over and over week after week when dbm covers a lot of it. I think the biggest benefit is threat meter which usually isn‚Äôt something ppl want to clutter coms with.
---
If you think the itemization is bad leveling up, just wait til you get to 60 and see some of the wacky "end game" gear that exists.
---
i'd prefer to see harders and new raid released than starting to have 9878 difficulty levels for the same raids
---
Unless you're taking thousands of screenshots, the storage space used isn't going to slow down even a windows XP computer and if you're really concerned about storage space then you could just delete the screenshot after uploading it somewhere.

Not if they launder it between farmer and seller

Are people actually buying gold from those spammers? Can't you get banned for that?
---
If you are new to Reddit and the sub you search the sub and read wiki/rules. Don‚Äôt excuse yourself.

But you might think that the search engine is an addon and cheating. But don‚Äôt worry it is not it just collects the public info that it is not on display in the interface and it shows it to the user in a more convenient way :)

Have a nice day mate!
---
I agree with you, at this point in gear progression and with all the bosses in MC being tauntable (correct me if I'm wrong), you're right in that it's not necessary to give CHT/Perds/Aged core leather gloves to tanks.
---
But that changes as both your caster and melee dps reach BiS and definitely will change in BWL (you will definitely see this mechanic come up on Vael.) Threat becomes the limiting factor for overall raid DPS in subsequent raids after MC. So while you may be limiting one person's DPS by giving an item such as this to the tank the net gain in raid dps is multiplicative in comparison to what the one person is missing out on by not getting that item. Also the quicker the boss dies, the less strain there is on healers and their mana pools. Once again to reiterate, and as a former rogue player, I agree I don't think Perd's should be prio'd to tanks over rogues at this point or at most maybe only 1 to the MT but OT's don't need it. But, in subsequent phases other classes need to accept the reality that overlapping gear going to a tank over a specific dps has a much greater cumulative effect on raid dps. Fury warriors and warlocks generate a ton of threat and both lack reliable aggro diminishing/resetting abilities, so the greater the room they have to work, the more they can push their dps.

my guild got 2 OEB in one run and one the week before. At this point no one needs them lol
---
Since you've already done it, would you mind telling me all the bop crafted items I need to make before I can swap to goblin? I saw that most of them were boe, and i couldnt find a good source for it.
---
Thank you! I'll need to get after it!
---
My addon warned me I'd been phased last night while I was listing auctions in Thunderbluff. First time it's happened to me.
---
The world is a PvP players Battleground! People like me will group and take away ALL your raids buffs before you step foot in MC or Ony. Enjoy your 0 DPS Shadow Priest
---
&gt; It's best to /reload ui after swapping.
---
Thanks, I was disconnecting and reconnecting when I needed to do that :D
---
I want to buy gold!

I had this happen before but can't reproduce it

Whispers are hella bugged anyway, sometimes it opens two windows for one person or you reply opens a second window instead of appearing in the first and sometimes when i close one whisper window it closes all which is really annoying

I have only ever seen these mobs doing it, so i am led to believe its just a behavior of the mob.
---
Not to be pedantic but in some circumstances smashing the windows on the ‚Äùright people‚Äùs‚Äô houses could indeed stimulate the economy thanks to redistribution of money and ‚Äùmarket efficiency‚Äù. Don‚Äôt know the proper terms in English.
---
&gt;Barely any RPI see RP on a daily basis on ZT. Just because you haven't seen it or aren't involved in it, does no
---
RP naming is in the server rules written by Blizzard. Whether or not people having names such as 'Gankbeast' is a problem to you is irrelevant, it's the rules of the server - the very least you can do is respect them.
---
Not all heros wear capes my friend
---
Parse refers to computer code reading through logs to find specific words or numbers.
---
DPS meters read combat logs, hence they are parsing the logs to determine what everyone is doing and who is top damage.
---
So saying "who gets the parse" means that you are cycling who gets top damage on that parse, or that fight(s).
---
I've got a few BoE blues I'm saving to sell later, my Verigan's Fist as a souvenir, various crafting materials and recipes.

Absolutely fucking dogshit.
---
depends on the time of day and if I have changed zones recently.
---
While I agree with this, for a BRD run (like OP), you aren't killing any elites outside of 1 or 2 bosses, so you just want to use the standard pickpocket ability (or a macro without any attacks).
---
Probably large fangs. Used for rage potions.
---
FAPs and the ingredients to make FAPs.
---
Invuln potions and limited invuln potions.
---
Major Health and Mana potions I can see selling well.
---
Pretty much any consumable that is good for PvP will sell. 
---
Nades will sell well, but those are limited to engineers only. Potions will probably be better, but I don't really know at this point.
---
I have never heard that; what language would the saying originate from?
---
Sorry, not sure if you get alert when I answer to my own post, but i finally remembered to post the information.
---
I'm like you, need an objective, and from what I hear, raids are very time consuming and only for the more dedicated players.  I'll see, for now I'm having fun leveling.
---
Sad thing is you'll actually use it for a long time too since the next upgrade isn't until Chromaggus.
---
Show me that trick you did one more time
---
Clicking abilities, without a back to a wall, and using DPS cooldowns while the tank is struggling to keep threat. Why is this being upvoted
---
Yet BoP items' real value is way above their vendor price. Hence it's not equal value to all party members. How is this such a hard concept to grasp?
---
Thank you for trying to remind me tho :)
---
Unsure... general exposure shows me hunters still suck as well.  No torch pass, maybe carry together?
---
Ah cool good lookin out.
---
Yepp and that shield is BiS until Naxx :)
---
Resorting to ad hominem? Come on, you're better than this.
---
10-4
---
Agreed, but the term "add-on", while being Blizzard's official term for the ability to interface with their API, is fairly ambiguous in nature.
---
I haven't messed with add-ons since retail 10 years ago, but at the time there were certainly programs with texture editors, idle macros, mining bots, etc that were pretty easy to find just by searching "wow mining add-on" in a google browser. Of course for anyone experienced with add-ons you could tell that it wasn't a normal add-on by the way it was installed; but there are new users here on classic that may not pick up on that.
---
we're 42-45 and we died way too much yesterday when we tried ZF.
---
why would you play it even if you did? It's garbage compared to classic.
---
All BoP items are also worth gold.
---
Why not just need on all BoP items as you can sell them for gold if you don't need them, and use them to buy what you actually need? That is the essential logic behind needing on BoEs.
---
&gt;So I don't want to smear anyone 
---
So edit out the names, it's not really appropriate on this sub in my opinion at least. Keep that stuff within your server community. 
---
Ruining their reputation, or at least trying to, is about the only thing available to you if you wish to pursue it. Be aware they can attempt to do the same to you.
---
Sorry that happened to you.
---
It's worse when the arrogant raid leader is simply convinced the hunter did it, refusing to listen nor reason about it and kicks him. While the guilty shaman stays silent.
---
Hunter life.
---
no
---
you don't need anything but a subscription. You don't even have to own the base game.
---
What do? What's fun for you!
---
Nope, any active WoW Sub.
---
Yes I do feel like RP servers can have more fun social interactions, but it depends if you are open to rp moments. Like on any server however some people just want to be left alone and play without interference.
---
The people I grouped up with (and rp'd with) were really nice and I have not had a single bad experience during grouping. But I have not done much rp yet.
---
In certain areas you'll see people rp'ing and sometimes they will include you or you can join in if you respect the rules.
---
Hydraxian waterlords is not a balanced server, it is largely in favor of Alliance.
---
If you want to play on a balanced rp server (in EU) then Zandalar Tribe is the server you are looking for, it's almost 50-50. It's a pvp server though so be mindful of gank squads and griefing, the server also has a bunch of streamers and their guilds ...
---
I started out on ZT, but my friends wanted to start on HW, I rerolled and haven't looked back or missed the ZT server at all. Those same friends have already quit wow, but I'm still having fun on HW, it's a very chill server.
---
Like every 1-2 hours on more active days like the weekend (Dreadmist, EU)
---
Yes, that's what I said.
---
I can't stand gnomes. 
---
Those little ball busters are always up to no good.
---
Do you have fun playing like you do? If yes: You do nothing wrong
---
Maybe he wants to form his own opinion on it?
---
But what if being left behind is anti-fun?
---
Sounds like an awful lot of kiting and a lot riskier.  What if no casters?  What if all melee?  Idk the ‚Äúsleep a DPS‚Äù is a low risk and quick win strat so long as your healer isn‚Äôt a potato.
---
APES are mental
---
That's the beauty of language my guy. It's constantly evolving. We have yeet, hurl, fling, toss, and throw, and none of them mean the exact same thing or have the same exact connotations to the people reading those words. They just 'feel' different. Linguistics is fun for many reasons but the fact that it accounts for new words and phrases *and* individual connotations is probably my favorite. 
---
As to why 'yeet' was coined? It was in a vine and it was funny. Thus, the context of 'yeet' being similar to a non-sports use of the word 'punt' (both used comically almost always) but different because 'to yeet' is supposed to be a throwing motion.
---
You could yourself be the yeeted/yote object, which is the instance in this video. 
---
I will say, however: if it's used as a pull, 'yoink' is a more appropriate word.
---
Grab it and try using it to deflect the tears of all hPals or rShams. And keep potions at hand, those healers "might OOM" more often after that :D
---
Is it that high armor/block on it?
---
That BoP item I have no use for is worth no more than the vendor price to me or anyone else in the game, with the possible exception of a party member.
---
My highest is a 33 Hunter, I have 3 alts in their 20's. I am playing the game to enjoy it, it's not a race for me. This is why my mage doesn't aoe grind.
---
gosh, it is almost like this clip was stagged for karma.  Who would do such a dastardly thing!!!!  I hope not someone in this subreddit, or that could end up in a paddlin'
---
Serve it to me as well, please :)
---
Yeah I got 500g and finished my epic mount in 5 days after dinging 60. My moneymaker was spamming dungeons for prebis lol.
---
If you are going to do a lot of pvp, the two points in Holy to resist spell pushback are highly, highly recommended.
---
Psychic Scream is a great way to respond to someone starting to engage or you can save it to interrupt their own casts.  Just keep in mind that undead can break fear every 2 minutes.
---
Since you will be in STV a while, keep fear ward and shadow protection up at all times on you and your buddies.  It will swing fights in your favor and will act as a buffer for dispel happy priests/shamans.
---
Shadow word pain is great to keep rogues from restealthing.  If you are worried about mana, just use a rank 1 SW:P and it has the same effect and duration.
---
Renew is a good pvp spell, as you dont have to stop moving to cast it.
---
Look into mouseover macros for your utility like power word shield, renew, and even your shadow word pain.
---
&gt; /cast \[@mouseover,help,nodead\]\[nodead\]\[@player\] Heal 
---
That will use the following priority, cast on your mouseover (cursor) first, then your target, then if no target or hostile target, you.  I use that exact macro all the time healing.  Let's me not have to worry about clicking names, I just hover over the portrait or in game and start casting.
---
&gt; /cast \[@mouseover,harm,nodead,mod:alt\]\[nodead,mod:alt\]Shadow Word: Pain(Rank 1);\[@mouseover,harm,nodead\]\[nodead\]Shadow Word: Pain 
---
This will cast SW:P on my mouseover, then my target.  If I use the alt key when I hit the macro, it does the same but with rank 1.
---
Two notes, not putting the rank means the game will use the highest rank spell of that name and the macros listed allow you to heal or damage when you have a friendly or hostile unit targeted.  So I can heal myself if I have Hoa targeted.  Or I can cast SW:P while keeping Hoa targeted.
---
Not really, almost every UBRS run is a Jed/Rend unless its for Onyxia attunement and having 4 casters in a group is extremely rare because of how many melee BiS drop. It probably takes a max of 10 runs even if you're rolling against 2 other people every run, combined with the fact that it only takes 30-45 mins to do, makes it, one of, if not the easiest pre-BiS farm in the game.
---
Witch hunting is against the rules here.  Putting community problem in quotes is a joke.
---
Don't out people you don't trust in charge of your loot.  Solved.
---
&gt;Each point of +Defense skill adds 0.04% to the player's chance to be Missed, to Dodge, and to Parry, before diminishing returns are taken into account, and adds 0.04% to the player's chance to Block with no diminishing returns. This means +25 Defense will grant you an extra 1% Miss, Parry, Dodge, and Block.
---
&gt;Crushing Blows can be made less likely or entirely avoided by increasing avoidance stats such as Dodge or Parry or the player's Block Rating, as well as using certain skills, to the point where the player's combined Miss, Dodge, Parry, and Block chances against that specific attacker exceed 85%. This is due to how the WoW combat roll system works, cf. Attack Table. In this regard, Defense Rating on gear does help against Crushing Blows.
---
Dal'Rend is not even close to higher DPS than Perds and CHT, I don't know what streamer you're parroting that from but it's incredibly wrong
---
Woah woah! Fun...
---
Be careful using that word around here... People like shitting on parades.
---
If there's one thing we know for sure, is that Blizzard doesn't know better than anyone.
---
Thanks for the insight !
---
Blue BoEs everybody should just Need for the sake of simplicity, but discuss with your group first. Takes 5 seconds to just say "everybody need on blue BoEs" at the beginning of a run. 
---
But, if it's something you could really use it doesn't hurt to at least ask if you could get it. If it's gonna sell for a ton on the AH tho you're probably just out of luck.
---
Bingo. :)
---
whatever you want to do
---
It's not "your" BoE, the entire group worked for it so the entire group should have a chance to benefit from it. Giving it to the person who can equip isn't fair to classes  that don't have any expensive BoEs
---
You aren‚Äôt getting left behind lol I know so many people who have hit 60 and only play a couple days a week because there is nothing else to do except raid and gold farm at 60.
---
That's why Forsaken are the nest locks. Just Life Tap and Cannibalize. I don't even keep food or drinks on me anymore unless I want the buffs they provide.
---
And i am herb/alch, never sold any herbs on ah
---
The OH in DM is far better for Pally's. My Healers do just fine. You can give loot to whoever you want to, but the facts are, the shield is BiS for prot warriors and it's not BiS for HPallys. It could be for Shamans, I don't know -- I don't play Horde.
---
I had the same one hit me up at least twice last night and I reported them both times, how did they not stop them after the first one??
---
See above. you cannot reduce the chance of crushing blows. . .but you can push it entirely off the table.
---
That looks pretty cookie cutter standard levelling spec. I'm assuming you'll fill out the Beast Mastery side first.
---
The only change i'd make is to leave Frenzy at 3/5 and put that point into Bestial Swiftness. Frenzy 3/5 still procs pretty often and the pet mobility helps a lot
---
The skin doesn't even sell, have 25 in my bags and stoped putting them up on AH cause I am just wasting gold.
---
lmaod
---
I recently had a guildie actually get her account hacked. She logged in and all her armor was vendored and money sent away.
---
So apparently it still happens
---
I think is a problem, SS has his own smaller reach, like a gnome with a dagger. Should be the same reach as the character using it. 
---
To avoid this i usualy end up using SS + WW combo.
---
Well they're both great offhands for a fury warrior, and if they plan on going fury-prot to tank then dual wielding Perdition's and Core Hound Tooth are going to be pretty great at threat generation. Probably even the best for single targets for a long time. They even get benefit from multiple items that give dagger weapon skill.
---
It wouldnt be as bad if the guild I'm in used dkp then I could have a better chance at loot like that for passing on everything else but it's always main spec /roll.
---
Thanks! I did think the post on the Blizzard page said a free copy of BFA though. Hope they won't revert that to a level boost.
---
Report them, scamming is against blizzards rules.  Unless they said that item was reserved they 100% scammed you.  Blizzard won't give you the item but they may punish the master looter.
---
It‚Äôs not a race. 
---
If it makes you feel any better know that I‚Äôm behind you.
---
Logged into retail for the first time since Cata and my lvl 85 pally had been leveled to 94, has 4k gold and fully leveled mining and herbalism, and a bag full of mats. Fairly certain my account was being used for this until I resubbed  for classic.
---
You actually get a full 5stack from an Uldaman quest. I saved mine till lvl 60 to save a couple of gold. Doesn't last forever though of course.
---
You can use scorpid sting (even rank 1, if you think you can tank the stun lock) to cleanse serpent when they get into blind range. Serpent is great for preventing restealths at range, but won't prevent a vanish-&gt;reopen because any good rogue will wait until he's between SS ticks to vanish/CS.
---
Then not being left behind is what do
---
haha good answer.
---
Tribal LW is for casters ; Dragon LW is if you are going Enhance (or a hunter)
---
If it‚Äôs a BOE then they can BUY IT
---
Bro you‚Äôre totally over sensitive
---
&gt; preferebly more expensive single items than thousands of small stuff which will increase. 
---
Then you would possibly have more luck looking at long term Twink items for Phase 3.
---
Phase 2 will mostly increase demand for useful Word PvP consumables.
---
Does anyone know if there have been any recent population surveys alliance vs horde? I love the server, but it seems pretty horde heavy.
---
Sir, may I interest you in some Gargoyle Slashers?
---
... show me that devilsaur in the back.
---
By what logic do you come to that conclusion.
---
It scales ~4% DPS/SP  
---
Frostbolt scales 32.57% DPS/SP (plus crit scaling)  
---
AE scales 9.5% DPS/SP  
---
CoC scales 9% DPS/SP  
---
Flamestrike scales 10.41% DPS/SP (for first cast only)  
---
By the time Blizzard scales well with SP relative to INT stacking, CoC+AE kite aoe'ing will be far superior to both.
---
For SP to have any real effect, it would have to shave a blizzard cast off in your kill-time. (3 blizz+FS+Coc) So you'd need around 850 spell power which is almost achievable with deep Arcane once every 3 minutes.  Unfortunately that talent also increases mana consumption by 30%, so it's not really going to work out in practice.
---
in TBC, it'll end up working out because while your mana pool only doubles, your +spell damage triples/quadruples.
---
our main tank is druid bro. Ragnaros is 4 deaths down for us too. We have a super geared warr and i trust my druid any day of the week. they are NUTS.
---
No he wasnt?
---
Wanna switch? Killed him equally number of times for healer trinket but no sign of it. But the boots and kilt dropped constantly. Damn RNG gods! üò°
---
You could make a prot/holy pally. tank dungeons, still heal content, maybe off tank some raid stuff if you are lucky. Put points into reckoning and you'll be able to throw on a 2h and blast people occasionally in pvp.
---
I doubt you will be able to kill anyone that is grouped up ready to raid... seeing as there are only a handful of players willing to literally WASTE their time doing PvP for 0 reward
---
why?
---
Have this same experience, only than in horde side.
---
Love some pvp but to just gank way lower players when p2 isn't even out yet... don't see the fun.
---
There is no rush at all.  Dire Maul is already released, so Phase 2 is just the addition of some world Bosses like Azuregos &amp; Kazzak, and the keyring. While Honor ranks are introduced, there is still no BGs in Phase 2. 
---
So you have plenty of time to play your hunter and level it up to surpass your Lock. You'll find levelling a hunter so much easier as there really isnt any down time.  Hunters are great to level solo too, you can do elite quests easily yourself.  
---
Phase 3 will not be out in 2019, so no rush whatsoever! 
---
Take your time and level whatever alts you want. I love healing, so my main is a resto shammy, which I got to 60 early October, and I now only use for raiding.  Between that, I am leveling an alt druid tank. Loving playing that and there really isnt much down time either on a druid.  Just keep playing away and enjoying what you do.
---
It was meant with a glint of humour, but these things can be difficult to get across in short writing. Guilty rShaman here, not familiar with hPal BiS lists but know that they too appreciate some mp5. I'd love that shield - at my current gear level an item would need to provide ~6 +healing per mp5 point to be of equal usefulness. That shield is my wet Mana dream.
---
Windfury, WF for short.
---
thank you!
---
Drop skinning
---
Boes can be bought on the AH, meaning BOEs=gold
---
Of course that dude has a warrior flair...
---
My server has a someone named "Dicegirl" who plays over/under with people in Ogrimar. Dicegirl has epic riding, and 4 BOE epics equipped, so just remember the house always wins.
---
geez, was just happy that i finally got the item I was in 6or7MC raids for and wanted to shar, quality was bc I originally posted it in my WoW whatsapp group with friends and undead ... yeah, said friends made me play horde the first time since the start
---
In the beta there was a loot icon next to each person's name when it was their turn to loot for group loot.  Don't know what happened between August 13th and august 26th, but it was removed to make room for the authentic experience.
---
What does AV Advantage mean?
---
If you roll Need on an item that is an upgrade just so you can sale it then your just a dick
---
Subjective.
---
I find playing as a short, stocky, thick-bearded human who uses alcohol as battle-fuel much more interesting than playing as a hunchback, tusked green human who can't tell the difference between fruit juice and demon blood.
---
None of the races are all that inspired. But they're all cool in some way. They'll seem even less inspired if you only look at their appearance without looking into their lore.
---
Yup. If I could get if for 1g, I would consider it a mediocre addition to the FR set. No idea whether anyone is buying for the 10g that seems to be the AH price.
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt get that either. Tbh it doesn‚Äôt happen much I was just exaggerating. Most high levels are chill. I‚Äôm learning that PvP itself is pretty fun though.
---
Yeah but I've got to take my hand off the mouse to type that ;)
---
Its called world of warcraft not indoor instances of warcraft! The designers have always said the world is the main character, it has many more purposes than just being a vehicle for levelling which is only a fraction of the game.
---
That's one of the main issues with retail, that the world is useless and therefore dead except whilst levelling.
---
Anyway its pointless us arguing there is no solution here, we either complain the world is overpopulated or complain about phasing. Blizzard can't win lol.
---
no, supposedly there are some Naxx catch up blues added to loot tables of the 5 mans we have been doing that is like almost as good as MC loot but was only added in 1.11 for people trying to catch up to Naxx.
---
But the problem is, I see it mentioned, but never saw a list of what those items are...
---
5% is the pvp cap, weapon skill is irrelevant in pvp.
---
Why don‚Äôt they buy the item then? No one EVER answers that
---
Also involves people going out of the instance to hand in parts of quest and going back in.
---
You still get a notification in the chat saying you got invited but it was blocked
---
How to not suck at rogue? Only reason I‚Äôm good at hunter because I have an animal tank.
---
Lol we still have layering on Razorgore xD
---
Dude thanks for this it helps a lot!
---
Hey guys we solo'd Onyxia last night only had 35 people
---
A guy in my guild got married and I sent him a sulfurion ingot that I won in a pug as a wedding gift.... hes been offline for 29 days now.
---
And that happens with 0 + defense because shield block gives you 100% block thus reducing the chance of a crushing blow to 0. So again, your statement that getting to 440 defense cap pushes crushing off the table is inaccurate.
---
Which server are you on now?
---
Or did you delete your ally and stay on bigglesworth?
---
Its easier to mount past most it not all Horde defenses and bases in AV, the forstwolf GY is off to the side in a wide open area making it easier to cap.  The towers can be easily solo capped by rogues as bowmen have no LoS on the flag.  The AV  bridge is a juggernaut of a chokepoint.  The Stormpike relief hut flag is dead center in the Alliance base causing all NPC's to respawn and flood it.
---
Alliance have a lot of small advantages that make it lean in their favor, The bridge is a massive advantage. Most Horde do not know the back door wall jumping trick to circumvent the bridge, which can be shutdown by even 1 or 2 alliance watching it.
---
It seems random.
---
Sometimes when they're chasing the mob down and it dies , they start there.
---
Sometimes I get attacked and the pet responds, and then hangs up the same way until I manually recall it (scroll wheel down to put on passive) or it'll start chasing me again after 2-3 seconds.
---
**A few points:**
---
**1)** I'm not going to tell you to get new buddies, however, it sucks to hear that they don't have the patience to help out a friend who is trying their best at the game. Classic WoW is certainly more enjoyable when you have others to share experiences with. As a fellow rogue player, I understand some of the mechanics can be daunting, so kudos to you for reaching out. I hope you stick with the class as it is one of the most fun/fulfilling roles I've ever played in WoW.
---
**2)** Yes, the general consensus regarding the weapons you mentioned are correct. Since you are Combat Sword Spec'ed, Thrash Blade and Mirah's Song will be your swords of choice until you get them replaced with Dal'Rend's set. Thrash Blade and Mirah's Song are free items obtained through dungeon quests so you'll need to group up with other people if you want these swords. For a rogue, weapons are the most important pieces of equipment to have since it is dictates how much damage you can output. While leveling to 60, I would suggest you get Thrash Blade and Mirah's Song as soon as possible. 
---
Once you get into your late 50's, it might be time to start thinking about getting your pre-raid BiS. As far as weapons are concerned, it completely circumstantial to your situation. Dal'Rend's are the most sought after melee weapons when it comes to pre-raid BiS. You'll have plenty of competition from other rogues and warriors so set expectations if you are shooting for Dal'Rend's. I've ran UBRS about \~35+ times before I got both of the swords and it definitely took a toll on my morale. Otherwise, if you are rolling in gold and don't have the patience to run UBRS, Krol Blade is an exceptional sword for pre-raid. 
---
In my honest opinion though, you can definitely still raid with just Thrash Blade and Mirah's Song. You won't top the damage meters, but it's still fairly comparable so long as you nail the mechanics of the fights. Remember, a low geared rogue still does more damage than a dead rouge.
---
**3)** As a Combat Sword Spec'ed rogue, your general set up should be as follows:   
---
Main-Hand = Higher Weapon Damage (usually the slower weapon)  
---
Off-Hand = Faster (weapon damage is still important though)
---
But why? In Classic WoW, weapon damage (not dps, but the actual damage range on the weapon) sort of correlates with the speed of the weapon. Slower weapons will tend to have much a much higher damage range to compensate for its slow attack speed and vice versa for faster weapons. The reason why it is important for a rogue to have a heavy hitting, slow main-hand is because spells such as Sinister Strike, Back Stab, and Hemorrhage all scale with weapon damage. For the off-hand side, a faster weapon means more chances to proc for your poisons and more importantly, your Sword Specialization talent. 
---
**4)** At 46, you'll be fine running Zul'farrak but I would suggest looking for Maraudon runs for the Thrash Blade and Blackstone Ring (one of the pre-raid BiS). If you don't already know, Maraudon is special because there is a way to skip most of the instance to quickly farm the Princess Theradras boss which drops your BiS Blackstone Ring. Maraudon is huge with three main sections: Shadowshard (purple wing), Ambershard (orange wing), and Earth Song Falls. Princess Runs will let you start at the base of Earth Song Falls, skipping the first two wings.
---
To start Princess Runs, look for an NPC named Cavindra (she's located in the orange area right outside of the dungeon entrance) and pick up the quest, "Legends of Maraudon". This quest requires you to kill Lord Vyletongue (purple wing) and Noxxion (orange wing) for their items inside the dungeon. Afterwards, takes these items to Celebras the Redeemed who is also inside the dungeon and he will help you make The Scepter of Celebras. For future runs, this scepter will create a portal which will teleport you to the end of the dungeon where you can farm Princess Theradras and a few other bosses.
---
**General rogue tips:** I don't know how well you know your class but here are a few things I wish knew when I first started out as a rogue.
---
\- If you are ever partied with a tank, position yourself behind the target to ensure none of your attacks get parried.
---
\- Turn on autoloot and create macros for each of your openers to include pickpocket. This will net you some supplementary income and lockboxes to train your lockpicking.
---
*#showtooltip Sap*  
---
*/cast Pick Pocket*  
---
*/cast Sap*
---
*#showtooltip Garrote*  
---
*/cast Garrote*
---
*#showtooltip Cheap Shot*  
---
*/cast Cheap Shot*
---
\- Train your First Aid skills as you are progressing. Bandages are vital to survivability and to increase leveling speed. The quicker you heal up after each mob, the less downtime you'll have while questing and grinding. Also, I would recommend making macros for Gouge+Bandage and Blind+Bandage since these will ensure you get the most use out of your bandages mid-fight.
---
*#showtooltip Gouge*  
---
*/cast Gouge*  
---
*/stopattack*  
---
*/use \[type in your bandage item here and delete the brackets\]*
---
*#showtooltip Blind*  
---
*/cast Blind*  
---
\- Assuming you spec'ed Riposte, I would make a macro to pair it with Sinister Strike. This way you don't have to watch for Riposte procs while you are spamming Sinister Strike.
---
*#showtooltip Sinister Strike*  
---
*/cast Riposte*  
---
*/cast Sinister Strike*
---
\- If you're on the horde side and get to party with a shaman, NEVER apply poisons on your main-hand. Windfury procs are godly in Classic WoW.
---
\- If you are about to kill a mob and have a few combo points available, consider spending those points on Slice and Dice so you have a buff available for the next mob.
---
\- Train your lockpicking as you level! There's nothing more embarrassing than running a dungeon and you're the only rogue in the party that can't pick a locked chest. Also, having lockpicking means you won't need to carry keys with you for certain dungeons.
---
\- Once you hit 60, start prioritizing the following stats: 9% Hit Rating &gt; Agility &gt; Strength/Attack Power &gt; % Crit Chance  
---
For Hit Rating, you will have 5% from the Precision talent, meaning you just need 4% from your equipment. There's a bunch of math that dictates the importance of 9% Hit Rating but the main reason why it is required is so that you won't miss your main damaging abilities while behind a target.
---
I'm sure there are other nuances about the class you will learn on your own but I hope this much helps.
---
Stayed in bigglesworth, I completely wiped my slate clean
---
thats the thing about old WoW. U cant max dps because the tank system was trash ¬¥. I also had to spec to frost mage and still managed to almost get aggro during illidan !
---
I'd like to see perd compared to dalrends. Any idea how it stands up against say viskgag or brutality blade?
---
Holy nova is really only useful during the Benediction quest imho
---
Yeah man just enjoy technically you are "already behind". Gor example I have been raiding for about a month. But there are plenty of people still hitting 60 each day and MC/Ony will be on farm for probably something like 4-8 months. Probably even easier getting geared in a month or two when more people already have what they need :)
---
Thanks! Will give this a try!
---
Aoe mage noob here. Do I want to use rank 2 frost nova or keep using rank 1?
---
Not in bear form with hots rolling, lol.
---
This is a useful macro indeed but something I wouldn't use for BRD farming. Only NPCs I'm killing are the fire elementals.
---
This macro is more useful in open world grinding/leveling in earlier levels
---
Why buy it when you can get it as a drop?
---
A lot of my mature guild has faded away.
---
Started with 30 and we are down to about 7.
---
Maybe I‚Äôm just particularly unlucky, but I haven‚Äôt gotten it so far rolling against priests, other mages, locks, druids, and shaman.
---
That's kind of what I was wondering. It seems like Blizzard doesn't have the resources to be hands on about loot, though. I did open a ticket, so we'll see if they do anything.
---
For me, it is all about the people I play with.  My wife and other friends are playing alliance - therefore I play alliance. But I like dark antiheroes, so I also enjoy the Horde story.
---
One of the biggest factors that changed hunters for the better midway to late through classic was items that add "attack power" adding ranged attack power too.  If that wasn't in place we'd be forced to use many many really shitty items over some that are drastically superior.  These kinds of arguments don't really hold water for me because if this was the true classic experience stuff like that would also be in place but it isn't.
---
Best way to farm for the pumpkin bags?
---
I mean I think that‚Äôs wrong for exactly the answer I gave. If you evis someone up front and they go to 10% and run, what do you have? You‚Äôre fucked unless until you chase them down. Better hope they don‚Äôt aggro a few more mobs or come into sight of another player. Or - you can rupture then around 30-50%, and when they run they‚Äôll die pretty quickly.  
---
Thanks for mentioning bandages, and they‚Äôre also great against other rogues to keep them out of stealth.
---
It was easier to just uninstall.
---
Edited them out. Thanks for the advice!
---
I'm in this boat lol. Rolled prot warrior myself, but my guild of 100 already has 3 other level 60 warrior tanks with 2 more in the 50s. I might just say, fuck it, and roll fury.
---
no love for C and V ?
---
Just do it
---
Keep using rank 1
---
I roll greed on everything that is:
---
not boe
---
not for my class/spec and not an upgrade
---
not for my profession
---
miscellanous (Righteous, Gems ecc).
---
Laughs in PvP guild. 
---
Heard of Private server guilds? Well we are all here in Classic now. With Sappers and co ordination, a small group can wipe out a whole raid of PvE'ers grouped up like the Sheep they are. I will link you the video of our guilds "Operation no buff" tonight as proof.
---
Phase 2 will be a shock to people like you who underestimate true PvP'ers playing this game.
---
We are having a blast! PvPers will take over Classic WoW. It will be GLORIOUS! üòÑ
---
Plaguebloom 20s ea, groms 60s ea on Smolderweb.
---
No one weapon spec is massively better than the other really. The problem is that there are many good swords and daggers to obtain and not really any good maces,
---
You'll see more mace rogues when naxx opens and the servo arm starts dropping, but until then its very restrictive to be mace spec.
---
I'm on Skeram and get multiple a night... I will definitely be using what OP is suggesting lol
---
Ive been upgrading mine as I go... but I‚Äôm starting to wonder if I shouldn‚Äôt do that. It‚Äôs using more mana and the damage is negligible
---
How is this a scam? That seems like the going price for 4 orbs on my server.
---
Nah man even a filet mignon healer will be pressed for mana keeping a goddamn dps up against that shitbag Eranikus. The fight sucks either way unless you have a druid or warrior off tank. The kiting strategy works realy well tbh but it can still be fucked up. And if all melee then well gg thats a tough instance to run bro
---
The goblin ones will blow up and literally destroy the item, the Gnomish ones will not.
---
Ironically I'm broke because I just bought the spellpower enchant for my mageblade.
---
Sunken temple can be about as long if you do the whole thing, especially if you do it at the expected level.
---
Clever! Thanks
---
This is what I've been doing. Plan on at least getting to 60 without using add-ons. Only 34 now so still have a way to go.
---
LW sucks and chances are you will be replacing the end game gear you make with it shortly after crafting anything.  THat said if you are deadset on going LW dragon scale is probably you best bet with Shaman maybe?
---
Agree so much with this. As an alliance player it's hard choosing a race because it's either boring or the class/race combo doesn't exist. In my opinion
---
Great races:
---
tauren, undead, dwarves
---
Mediocre:
---
humans, orc
---
Sub par:
---
Trolls, night elves
---
Gnomes:
---
Gnomes
---
Thank you for all the awesome input!!  This was what I was figuring.... In my Raid/Dungeon set I can get 5 blizz off, but I cant do much else to manage the adds/resists/whatever.  I can do it, but it doesn't feel right.  For me I had to have 3/3 imp blizz to be able to reliably aoe farm.  This change I think will be similar as I feel like I'm using the "wrong tool for the job".   Like cooking breakfast with a blowtorch.... It works, but not quite as efficient as it could be...
---
This is what I've understood it to be.
---
But where? And I mean the serious ones. Not the obvious memes.
---
there aren't any armor drops in stockade aside from world drops...
---
\&gt;  M+ were formed using the LFG tool from anywhere. 
---
So just like Classic WoW. Or are you really trying to form a group by sitting in Org all day? Are you not using the global channels? Why aren't you out in the world doing stuff while waiting for a group to form? The AH mount costs 5 million gold. Not everyone has abused the WoD garrison and I haven't seen that mount all week btw. True about the professions.
---
 I don't get what you guys are trying to prove here.
---
Depends in which situation you're in. The stam could be a bonus in PVP and the spirit can give you extra healing if you're specced for it. But honestly, don't waste your gold on that shit. Just go run Ony and hope to get a T2 instead.
---
I have never gotten one on Gehennas which is the most populated server on EU, but I get them all the time on my alt on Earthshaker which is a low/med pop server. Maybe it's due to them targeting mid level players who are either about to buy mount or hit 60?
---
That's sick dude, youre a KING. Hope this strokes your ego enough.  Clearly I wasnt getting gold well enough, then I switched something, and it became easier. Idk what to tell you
---
its worth about 2g why does it matter? unless you needed it?
---
neither have I! I even searched the subreddit to see if anyone has reported it, I did not see anything so I'm glad to share!
---
I would not give DB to a tank, I'd at least make sure my top 2-3 fury warriors had it first. 2.90 is not optimal for when you are rage capped. Annihilator is kind of expensive,  but an excellent choice for orc tanks.
---
Ok cool! Thanks, what would be the best place to learn about adding macros?
---
You definitely don't have to aim for that, but still the cap though ;)
---
This is Runescape-tier scamming.
---
What are you talking about? That logic is so broken I don't even know where to begin. You can vendor BoP but that isn't enough gold to be tradeable for another BoE. Say Edgemasters drops. You could give it to the Warrior. That would be okay, there's nothing wrong with that. You could also have everyone roll on it and then the winner could sell it and buy themselves freezing band, or an epic mount, or whatever else they want. Frankly it's more fair because some classes don't have expensive BoE and thus are cut out from essentially playing the lottery like everyone else.
---
Idk warlocks require gear and some skill to play well. Specifically early on they need stamina due to lack of mobility. They really shine later on with some gear. You also need some decent in game knowledge like which pets to use which curses to use when to spam fear etc. mage and rogue are much easier to pick up and feel good with because of access to strong cooldowns. Also both are much less gear dependent than warlocks as they can access hit% via talents.
---
Awww I love it! Please give her cuddles on my behalf XD
---
Oh good point, I forgot about that. I did so many BRD runs for gear I just did it piecemeal.
---
I was a bit reluctant at first with how undead looked, but as time went on I got more used to it. Moreso I just realized I‚Äôd be pissing off alliance players by playing the complete opposite of a human which does look badass when you‚Äôre all about killing.
---
Go tribal for Hide of the Wild. But let it be known to you that you can just buy it on the AH. OR if you want to make resistance gear, which you can also buy, go elemental. May I ask why you want to keep lw as profession even though it‚Äòs clearly a bad profession in classic?
---
What's your point?
---
I think that's the question, how to balance it.
---
Yeah whatever you say mate xD
---
I‚Äôm on low pop server and I get these every 3-5 minutes, not too bad but just enough to be annoying
---
How exactly would you launder the gold? I'm curious.
---
Buying shit on AH then selling that stuff again?
---
It's a pet that doesnt do anything. It's a bit early for people to care about stuff like that
---
I roll greed on everything that:
---
is BoE but its value it's negligible; is BoP but not an upgrade for my Class/Spec; is a recipe not for my profession with negligible sell value.
---
Check out the Fight Club discord. Almost all the info you need is there. Please read all the faqs and pins before asking questions.
---
It's tough to know without specific details.  Is it possible this was the only dagger rogue in the raid?  Does said rogue have Aged Corehound Gloves?
---
Both of those are big factors IMO and while it might seem like a ninja, giving a dagger to a dagger rogue makes sense.  Just because every other rogue "could" spec daggers if they won it, doesnt mean it's fair to give it to them.
---
In return I give you my tip
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
I don't really care, for now at least. There is nothing I "mass produce" and sell, i use mainly to scan for up-to-date tooltip values, and bulk sell everything I don't need. 
---
Note that the selling function doesn't "autoselect" the price (like Auctioneer does where you have you various pricing models e.g. "market value"). Everytime you sell something it's set to you last price, and you can click any existing auction to match/undercut that price. It's a click more, but I got used to it fairly quickly.
---
The upside for me is the powerful query function (not giving away my secrets, but it's possible to make a query that shows everything that is listed below vendor price *winkwink*) and the clean achitecture, i.e. not bringing a metric ton of dependencies (informant? beancounter? enchantrix? ...).
---
On anything but a fight that ends exactly at a multiple of 3 mins the TOEP will come out way ahead of the Reed.  In the long run they average to about the same +damage, but the burst option is generally always better because it allows you to sync with either other temporary buffs or get through burn phases faster (like Onyxia P2.)
---
I have been using rank 1 because it's cheaper with the same root time. I wasn't sure if it hold strength and resist rate depended on rank.
---
Don't use that shit. Keep rank1 handy against rogue players who are trying to sneak up on you.
---
underrated comment
---
It is legit, you will not be banned for using it.
---
Thanks dudes
---
Oh, TIL.
---
Yeah I'm not saying just hit need on every item that drops. Loot rules should certainly be established beforehand. If they haven't been though I dont see an issue with discussing it when the item drops.
---
My opinion is if an upgrade drops and you don't roll need then you're dumb.
---
Bear in mind you don't get Kromcrush's loot in the tribute chest without the ogre suit.
---
Yeah I okay about once every 5 days due to my work, but when I do I can go for about 6-8 hours easy
---
Im interested in this too as a fellow up and coming warr tank. It is my understanding that demo shout should be kept up to mitigate damage but battle shout should be worked into rotation in lieu of demo because it cannot be resisted and gives better threat in 1.12
---
Paladins have never struggled with threat gen in dungeons so idk if it's even worth it. But yes 3 of the same class would generate 114*3 threat immediately.
---
We roll on it to see who gets to sell it.
---
Agreed
---
Insults are a turn on for me owo
---
Nah son, if you need. You need that shit, sounds like someone got upset they lost a roll
---
If you're talking about solo farming at 60, you're right, the margins are thin, But once you get it down its very easy.
---
I know, I know, everyone says that about everything. But in this case, using ZF farm as an example, the difference between heading-bangingly difficult and super easy is seriously just a few small tweaks to how you approach it. Its small things, proper iceblock timing, proper shield usage, ect, that can take it from dieing over and over, to never dieing again.
---
If you have any specific questions hit me up, I know the pain.
---
They're probably just both somewhere inside the building.
---
Spam. It's a step by step progressive macro with every click as I remember.
---
Idk what server he's on but mining on Faerlina is like phase two come early. The amount of killing I need to do in order to get any decent mining done is insane. I have 6 trinkets I rotate on cooldown to anticipate ganks. This morning at 6am I had to kill this guy mining and he pulls a mech dragonling on me. I had to switch from prot to ret just so I could mine lmao.
---
&gt; How do i keep aggro on 4+ mobs at once when the dps are all doing AoE abilities?
---
Your question looks like "4 thugs armed with guns attacking me. How I could win?". Answer is simple - you can't.   
---
Goal is not to get into such situation.  
---
Ask them to stop AoE, give you time to establish aggro.
---
that's a con, not a scam
---
How much hit is needed to be hit capped in dungeons? Lots of info on raid bosses but I can't find anything for dungeons. Dwarf Paladin if it matters.
---
Everyone needs to know this
---
If a tank gets a SS and revenge before dps start hitting there is almost no way to lose threat, as long as they are spamming those abilities with sunder and shield block in between
---
So he got multiple pieces AND was allowed to roll against you on leaf? And you went in, probably spent a bunch of gold on consumes, and got literally nothing out of it (not even the cop out of ‚Äúwell the raid team got gear even if I didn‚Äôt‚Äù since it was a pug)
---
And people still think open rolling is the best method of loot distribution...
---
No that isn't what he is saying at all. You are performing mental gymnastics for no reason. Epics are a 1 in ~10k drop chance there is no immersion breaking by finding a super rare item, bringing it to market, then purchasing your own super rare item.
---
step 1) need on warrior item
---
step 2) complain on tank shortage
---
Guys, whatever. I couldn't care less on what you do in this game. I described my position. That's it. Not going to continue this conversation
---
&gt; I get that argument, and while I don't really buy it (because a rogue is going to switch specs based on the gear they have)
---
Yeah, I disagree here - each raid should have dedicated dagger rogues.  Being able to roll on every sword and dagger with the promise of swapping specs is BS.  Especially because it'll likely be a slow process to get a Corehound tooth, Corehound gloves and Perds. That being said, it doesnt sound like that was the case here so kind of a moot point.
---
Your best bet is to name and shame on the public forums, discord and sub-reddit.  Bring screenshots with you to back it up.
---
I think you mean opposite?
---
Well good luck with your boner then lol
---
Death wish leaves you quite vulnerable when fighting 3 mobs, and for 2 SS is all you need. Additionally, death wish has a 3 minute cd. Better to stay in arms and get mortal strike instead. 
---
Forget about improved cleave, the little bonus damage is quite irrelevant.
---
A warrior ninjaed my leather belt in BRD the other night.  Brutal.  In case there is any confusion warriors, it IS NOT OK to do that.  Scum.
---
Alliance you get to kill undead monstrosities instead of being forced to play with them.
---
How is it greed if it is an upgrade
---
You‚Äôre a hunter and you want to dual wield dal rends?  Pretty sure barbarous blade is you‚Äôre BIS. Ya you messed up, big time.
---
BRD
---
Thanks man, thats helpful
---
It's an upgrade that you won, oh well. If the guild cared enough they would have established the loot rules prior to the run.
---
Technically yes, but you aren't going to hit it.
---
The critcap would be 83+hit(up to 16) so the lowest critcap would be 83% without any hit, and 99% with 16%.
---
You play on a PvE server?   
---
In that case it can be like this:
---
Shaman is flagged for PvE
---
You are flagged for PvP
---
You do not get the buff cause the shaman is not flagged. 
---
Right click on your portrait and change your pvp status to get the same as the aura wielder.
---
Sell it now, gold now is more important than gold later
---
..... re read your original post.
---
I‚Äôm shaking. So scared.
---
What are some horde dungeons worth checking out for a forever ally player? Like in ally we have deadminea and gnomeragan that everyone should experience.
---
Yeah wtf is this about too.  Gouge is a guaranteed hit from mob before it goes off.  WHY?
---
I'm leveling as a ret paladin, level 44 and still not done with my mail to plate transition, but it feels like the raging berserker helmet is just too damn good to replace with most of the crap before level 50. That 1% crit is huge. Am I wrong to value that crit chance ?
---
I usually prioritize of the eagle or of the gorilla when I'm getting greens (not super common, I rarely buy greens and focus on weapon upgrades). But I've got quite a few stats to balance, and feels like the armor increase from plate isn't worth losing out on that crit chance yet - more crit means more vengance uptime. Most of the blues in my level range seems to have a bunch of spirit on them, which isn't the most useful stat in the world for me.
---
Yes, that‚Äôs why I said you could probably do better by using it strategically.
---
Corpse running blows
---
But without winners and losers there is no game 
---
Don't see the point of going to BRM if you aren't terrified of getting waylaid
---
it's not even BIS because agility enchants don't exist yet
---
ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥
---
I've waited years to play classic, I am in zero rush for them to push out patches fast just because some people dont have jobs and raced to do everything.
---
Agreed. Hand of Rag is mostly for the memes.
---
Right server, wrong faction.
---
Gratz! /cheer
---
Hey thanks so much man! :D
---
Ha! That‚Äôs the only language I can use without getting nasty. I was healing as a Druid and our tank bailed so we got a priest and I picked up tanking.
---
Cloak of cosmos drops and he says I have no right to roll as tank. Fuckin brat
---
You don't. Dungeon runs are a team effort, the dps needs to give you time to build aggro before starting aoeing.
---
 There are two ways to deal with this. Either talk to your party, explain thst you need around 10 sec to build aggro if they want to aoe everything. Or just shrug it off and pray your healer can keep them alive as mob aggro is split across the party. Remember that the healer is by and far the most important party member to protect, if you can keep aggro of them your paety should still manage to survive anything that isn't overpulled.
---
Not true but okay
---
I personally just put it under cheating but it probably doesn't matter either way.
---
Hes asking if you are pvp flagged while trying to get the auras.
---
If you are pvp flagged (meaning you physically typed /pvp to turn ON pvp) or if you attacked someone recently, you will be flagged until you are 5 mins out of pvp combat. If you are flagged and some one in your group (shaman/warlock) are not flagged, then you will not receive the advantage to their aura unless you unflag or they flag themselves.
---
Two words:
---
Class identity.
---
Which means class dehomogenyzation (sp)
---
I can stomach having a million things to do. I'll pick out the things I like to do, do them and skip raiding. I don't have time for raids anyway, so lots of small things for me to progress through is ideal anyway.  
---
What I can't stomach is that all classes are, virtually with out exception, playing as follows:
---
Apply dot/damage buff &gt; resource builder &gt; resource spender. 
---
Effectively all classes have become a weird mix of Rogue and Warlock.
---
I love you &lt;3
---
Waiting till everyone else has rolled greed, then rolling need stating you need it for your wife, isn't a logical sane thing most people will do.
---
My server is high pop and it never looks like this due to layering I assume. Nobody said this game was dead just dont fall for the hype that its the "better" version of WoW like I see everyone claim in game then 90% of ppl saying that havent touched retail in years.
---
We got onslaught and sipnal reaper [last night!](https://trafficguild.us/guild-data/raid/91d688ce-3507-471e-8990-1755b8addb3b)
---
Im a level 54 rogue and last night I did my first BRD arena run ever. This is the highest level I‚Äôve ever gotten to in WoW and I messed up the first arena run pretty bad because I didn‚Äôt realize how perfect you have to do the actual run to the arena as not to pull the crowd. I got it very quickly but I felt bad after causing us to wipe. Are there any other runs like this that I should know? And are there any good videos about the black rock dungeons for melee dps that I could watch?
---
Just get barb blade from DM. It was a dick move for sure.
---
How would you feel if you ran LBRS with guild and a rogue took blackcrow from you when they can easily get an equivalent stat stick from DM East that isn‚Äôt needed by hunters due to attack speed?
---
You shouldn't be rolling either way, it's not BiS for you.
---
Imo and I‚Äôm a tank that‚Äôs passed dal rends you were a bit selfish. It‚Äôs only a good sword if you have both of them. There‚Äôs a 2h sword from tribute runs that‚Äôs comparable if not better than the set swords. You took a marginal increase for yourself versus someone that will actually use the weapon to beat monsters silly. Hope you don‚Äôt get salty if your raid weapons are prioritized to physical dps before hunters. Because they more than likely will be given to rogues and fury warriors before you.
---
Because they chose to NOT spend gold to instead try and greedily get it for free (punishing their dungeon mates w longer run times in the process).
---
The exception is only if the item is not for sale on the AH, but that‚Äôs rare.
---
Yeah, multiple items per boss was a policy but not per run. I mean, it was either that or I miss a lockout so I'm in same boat, but yeah it sucked. Lol
---
Lol what. This item seems only uswful to shaman. Iant it like a bunch of spirit?
---
It's gone now
---
Flameguard + cloudkeeper is where its at!
---

There will always be a reason for guilds to run MC, so no need to worry about missing out on that.
---
I took a day or two off at lvl 55 so I'd suggest that.
---
FD is bugged and spell batching is fucked
---
Mix em together and you get the Vanilla FD&gt;Trap experience.
---
Charge/range pull thunderclap/demoshout then whirlwind. You need to tell them to wait like a couple of seconds first.
---
we, &lt;sunk cost&gt; one shot everything in one night last night. 8p-1045.
---
What a mutt
---
It is in favour of the alliance, but not 'largely'. if it was a pvp server it probably would have tilted massively like on others, but due to it being pve, it's mostly fine. We have no up to date census data, but it feels like we're at maybe 55:45 ratio now. Plenty of horde everywhere you go.
---
I'm on krom.
---
It's fine.
---
It's PVP. They leave eventually.
---
You misread my comment. It doesn't sell at the moment due to such little demand. I make 5 mooncloth every 4 days.
---
I think we were all bad in some ways in vanilla
---
This is a life saver
---
2 handed hunter with nightfall though
---
Does it matter how he would feel? Losing a roll always feels bad. That doesn't mean you should roll need on upgrades.
---
If you're new to 60 you're likely not going to be able to do them in 1 big pull, especially without an epic mount.
---
The mobs in classic hit you from 10 yards away so you'll just get 1 shot randomly when it doesn't look like you should, and the run back sucks.
---
Way safer to just do the 3 pulls individually
---
I finally realized this the other day... Huge QoL improvement!
---
Ahh thats good to know thanks a lot.
---
[True warriors are vegan](https://classicdb.ch/?item=13810)
---
our main tank is getting first onslaught girdle. im gona make sure of it. 
---
i already cant fucking dps in raid if i dont have tranq air. god knows i dont need this shit
---
Since when can you only need roll on BiS lol
---
I'm so envious.  I really want a big-mouth clam to drop.
---
hahahahaah
---
Well, props to your guild at least for treating pugs fairly and not giving preferiental treatment to guild members.
---
Stand against the walls, Jesus.
---
Well I'm currently not level 60, so it's more: sell it now or wait until I'm 60 and am able to maybe get closer to an epic mount with higher prices?
---
You have infinite water. If I have to summon half the raid it means I can't give out healthstones.
---
Only because Paladin T2 is the peak of tier set fashion.
---
My warrior is about to hit 60, and I'm looking to level an alt. Mostly intended as a change of pace, but also as a source of gold (eventually).
---
Debating between mage, hunter, and warlock, since they all are ranged, good at solo farming, and good in PvP.
---
Vanishing death coils are the best
---
Nobody said reserved. If you roll on items that aren't optimal for you when they are for others you are a turd, Simple as that.
---
Seeing an upgrade that's better for someone else and needing on it is a shitty attitude, Share gear that are better for others don't be a dipshit by seeing a blue and needing on it. Use the brain cells wisely.
---
Please guys can we please please stop with these posts
---
Int and stamina for farming and pvp (open world). I have something like 3k hp and 6.5k mana, ideally 4k/7+k.
---
My farming routine has been changed. Used to be blizzard 3/3 farm with 2 full blizzard, nova and repeat. Now I do CoC 1rank + AE1rank(fishing for clearcast procs) , running around to form perfect pull, keep nova for any resists. Way more Mana efficient than blizzard.
---
It's a sword with on hit proc. Of course it's useless on a hunter but it's purple and it's funny to see people flip their shit over a hunter wearing one. Totally worth the 20 agi or whatever the alternative was.
---
Better. It was streamed.
---
Five hours a week is tough to level, but with Phases you may be able to hit 60 around one of the phase drops which should make getting gear a little easier.  
---
Also Battlegrounds are vastly different than world PVP,  some are simple like Warsong Gulch or Arathi Basin, others like Alterac Vallery are long and drawn out with multiple objectives, people usually love it or hate, not much in between, I personally love AV and am looking forward to some all day battles.
---
With the stream conveniently ending just prior to the looting of course.
---
Yea im leveling an alt warrior and when it crits, usually its 2 in a row too
---
I've primarily played horde since vanilla. I've been debating rerolling to experience the alliance side for a bit now. I don't regret my main, but experiencing iconic alliance zones does sound fun.
---
I am a warrior, but I definitely used Raging Berserker Helm until I was 60. That helmet has incredible stats for something so low. Don't feel bad about using it!
---
Does anyone know what [UI frames this is?](https://gyazo.com/8eb81a420d3c085da41ba521919e1700) Sorry for the bad picture, I had to grab it from a stream with snipping tool
---
frost played nonstop for like 30 days lmao
---
I haven't noticed it being that bad, on Skeram.
---
Maybe it's just because I avoid farming during primetime.
---
If it's purple or blue and says bind on equip then its probably worth significantly more than the other loot that's dropping. There are few exceptions to this besides the high level dungeons where the dungeon blues are worth about as much as greens. Even a little knowledge about classes should allow you to infer what items are good or not.
---
Plus, if you think you got something unfairly because you followed this guideline and needed and nobody else did then you can be a good guy and have everyone else who didn't roll, roll in chat and give it to them.
---
I would be down for p2 pvp objectives and p4 t0.5.
---
thanks will try, sm/ds is my farm spec anyway
---
Looks like shadow(Ed?) unit frames
---
Moot:  he wasn't the only dagger rogue, and he definitely wasn't the highest rolling dagger rogue. It was a ninja.
---
Glad you are enjoying the game and finding cool stuff like this organically.
---
Just hit lvl60 on my paladin. I retalented full holy at around 55, and have been running dungeons ever since. Yesterday I went out questing and I realized I can do zero things by myself now (besides autoattacking mobs to death 1 minute at a time). I have leftover things to do in the open world, plus I obviously want to be able to defend myself and fight back if need be (I'm on a pvp server), but I also want to keep advancing in pve by more dungeon grind and soon raiding. So my question is: what to do? How do (holy) paladins deal with these issues at 60?
---
Drillborer is better. You shouldn't be aiming for defense cap. There really is no point to get it as a warrior.
---
Just as a base comparison of Draconian vs Drillborer: Drillborer has 2% mitigation(block %), Draconian has \~1.25% mitigation (+8 def = \~1% mitigation). Drillborer also has higher armor and block value.
---
Ohhh!  Those bitches. Pretty clever though. Thanks for the info :)
---
*laughs in warlock*
---
I'm at 56 and I still wear mostly mail, there doesn't seem to be a ton of plate gear with better stats than what I already had. I wouldn't discount spirit though, with blessing of wisdom and a moderate amount of spirit you'll basically never need to drink while questing.
---
15 year old game. Loot Drama still exists. They wonder why Retail went the direction it did with personal loot.
---
But Activision doesn't get a cut here so we can't have that now, can we?
---
I'm on Stalagg and I leveled my engineering to 300 through the AH.  It ran me 170g.  So it'll be less than that since a lot of that cost was thorium and mithril.
---
BoE's are typically needed. It's gonna case by case basis though, typically in groups I've been in people ask of they can need to use it or learn the recipe etc.
---
No true warrior would dare wear anything less than mail. What's the point of stats if you sacrifice your very essence, your very soul?!
---
That's the shield which has a chance to lose durability when it procs yeah?
---
Ret, fury enh etc all use leather and mail alongside plate at 60 for hit and crit. It's true that armor will help leveling, but so will DPS!
---
- PvP/Battlegrounds. BGs aren't in the game yet but at 5hrs/week they may well be by the time you're 60.
---
- 5-man dungeons are still viable.
---
- Level new characters/classes.
---
- Pick professions that you like doing and just log in to do those. Sell potions on the AH, fish for rare or in demand fish, sell cooked +stats food to people, so on.
---
Depending on the guilds on your server see if you're able to join a raiding guild that accepts social/non-raiding members. If you build up a reputation inside the guild providing things like potions, food, helping guild members out with non-raiding stuff, you could always ask further down the line to join raids for an hour or two at a time and maybe get some drops. If you're a known contributor to the guild and the stuff you're asking for isn't in demand by the main raiding team they might let you tag along.
---
It seems to have picked up again in the last week after going silent for a while, did they discover a new way to spam people after Blizzard blocked the old method?
---
Happens at times on all PVP servers.  Last night I had a bunch of turn ins to do at Marshal‚Äôs Refuge in Ungoro and Horde has taken it over and was killing everyone.  
---
I just chilled for 5-10 minutes and they eventually got bored and I got my turn ins done.
---
You need to get your shit sorted out with your guilds, honestly.
---
No melee will want to roll against 16 others, because every melee can roll on every 1hander and 2hander, because they will be able to wear it.
---
This will result in a clusterfuck of discontent, because you have every warrior roll on viskag and brutality because of edgemasters while also rolling on BRE and spinal and eye, because they are good weapons, ALSO rolling on deathbringer, because it's a great wepaon as well. Now you can even make a point to roll on CHT for the warrior OH. Rogues are left out to dry while warriors can bid on every weapon they fancy.
---
People will not be happy.
---
Exactly this
---
As others said, you don't. 
---
What helps is getting some time to build rage and threat before others join in. Additionally, you can make use of your taunt and stun - intentionally losing aggro before taunt or stun.
---
Right, I just want a good resource besides YouTube vids hah
---
Yep
---
I have 3 sets, one for farming, one for pve and one for pvp.
---
i clear strat live in 40 minutes idk what makes it take 1.5 hours for ya
---
Exactly why I like skullflame shield more, at least for aoe farming
---
One level 40 and a normal life or 8 level 40s after 12h of wow per day every day since launch?
---
Ban'thok, the hit is worth a ton for warlocks.
---
Ah, this is the most helpful comment yet. Thank you!
---
I'm not sure if they are targeted, or if it is confirmation bias, but I get them significantly more often while leveling my alt (around level 20) than when I am playing my main at 60. Last night I had at least 5 over a two hour leveling session.
---
Except there is no guild bank...this subreddit is so out of touch
---
I just figured out how to do this last night haha
---
Most people will need on BoE epic.  
---
Gotta tell people beforehand what the run down is.  
---
Or reserve it if you wanna guarantee it (and let people know beforehand).
---
It has been a well known fact for 15 years that kids and pervs play alliance while real men play horde. This was established in barrens chat and on the old official forums and have yet to be disproven.
---
Not sure about the optimal gear progression, but I wore that helmet till 55 when I retalented holy.
---
I died like two-three times as alliance prieston a pvp server in STV where I did all the quests. The only deaths were to 60s camping the hunting camp. Same levels in quest areas never attacked me and often helped.
---
Feral PvP gear. What do ya‚Äôll do? Obviously when P2 drops I‚Äôll farm up some real pvp gear but in the meantime how do you handle it? As is I have a shit mana pool. Do you just toss a couple of high stat caster pieces on there? You pick up stuff like songbird blouse and the all stats shoulders off ras?
---
Right now I‚Äôm in a smattering of cat and bear pieces with T2 helm, T1 chest, and lava dredger to help boost my mana pool and healing ability but it still feels kinda shitty. I could keep swapping in more caster gear but it will just continue to just sacrifice my already marginal damage output.
---
Are ferals just kind of SOL until we can rank and/or T2.5?
---
Can we prevent the game from storing files in this folder to skip the task scheduler?
---
Literally everywhere!  I'd post links but there's just so many!
---
prompt
---
Buddy you don't gotta take offense to this and give an ignorant reply in return. I'm more casual than you? I was 1 of the server first 60s on mine, I was server horde first rogue, got full MC and Ony clear server horde first again. I can go on and list more accomplishments and things, but you'll just get mad and try to insult me again. If you're getting burnt out at 40, find another game. WoW aint for ya. Enjoy the grind, don't come on reddit and cry about it. The people that agree with you are just like you; casuals. Not an insult just a fact. Last reply, lata and GL finding a new game
---
Ret has some good burst without reckoning. If you crit a white hit and command at the same time and judge you can wipe people out.
---
Hunter is probably easier to gear and better with less gear. Ret you really want those mix stat items that show up less in raids. The best stuff is probably the epic dungeon set, the pvp set, and the aq40 set, all of which you won't see for a while.
---
I might even say hunter is better against rogue. Flare, deterrence, Dots, hunters mark. If the rogue isn't propping Sprint and free action potions you can kite them forever.
---
the time limit forces you to rush through as fast as possible for no reason and you need a keystone as high as possible so you try to rush the dungeons even faster and that's as far away from fun as I can imagine
---
this system makes people leave after the first whipe because you won't complete in time anymore and it prevents you from talking while progressing through the dungeon
---
spellcleave groups in classic are a direct result of m+ gameplay
---
Exactly, directly related and has it's own flavor since the value of the item in POE comes from full linking the item. Combining the graphic from qotf body armor, it's very hard to tell its fully linked at a quick glance
---
I think so, but it sounds like you might be severely underestimating how insane the grind is to get r13.
---
YW
---
Same here! If I remember correctly, there is an abandoned house where retail's SW Harbor goes. I'll have to check it out to see if its there.
---
Sadly, you have to repeat this process on every character. Still, very useful!
---
I did the same, 4 alts Alliance side, I love the cities, the quests, the lore, everything, but the community really isn't there ( at least in my experience ).  
---
Things to know for shaman:  
---
Use a staff with rockbiter for leveling until 20, then try to get a 2h axe/mace. If you're struggling with sustainability, try a dagger with flametongue and shield.   
---
You CAN tank dungeons, if you slightly outlevel them. Tanked a RFC at 16 with no issues whatsoever. Earth shock is your taunt, and keep rockbiter on your dagger on at all times. Lightning shield and armor totem for larger packs.  
---
You can also heal dungeons as any spec, just have a few +int/spirit/healing done items in your bags.  
---
Remember your totems.
---
They‚Äôre also 20g-25g on Stalagg. Not sure if Golemagg is high pop, but it seems to be a fair price
---
On a scale of 1 to 10, how much of a boomer are you?
---
When I‚Äôm in Stormwind, I probably get 4 every twenty minutes
---
I hear there is no q&amp;a this year. Probably don't want questions about hong kong
---
It takes it away completely, dispel
---
I have it check on my hunter but not my warrior
---
So, were the warlock / shaman also flagged for PVP?
---
If not then that is your issue just as /u/bchamps93 explained.
---
I agree, it's way to late now. Writing a solid and reliable UDP protocol is hard work and not done in an evening (or a month, even). Only Blizzard knows how they can fix their current issues, maybe better package priority, maybe sending fewer packages. We can only guess.
---
However, you can solve all the issues you've mentioned. There are libraries (e.g [yojimbo](https://github.com/networkprotocol/yojimbo), written by Glenn Fiedler), which are implementing protocols addressing your concerns.
---
 What I can say with certainty, through experience, is that a properly written UDP protocol can and will solve these issues. To me, it look like the demonstrated issue is entirely related to dropped packages.  You'll see the game "replaying" all the missed events later on, once it caught up again.
---
Athough please bear in mind that these numbers are for full runs. A lot of these dungeons offer considerable options to skip trash or even bosses for a faster run if you're at max level. This is most important in DM, where jump runs (DM:E) usually involve skipping pretty much all trash for a much faster run, and tribute runs (DM:N) heavily punish pulling extra stuff or even one of the patrolling guards. You will most likely not get invited to these runs before 60. Some groups will also refuse to take you for Scholo/Strat/LBRS because there again you can skip a lot of trash if everybody is max level.
---
At level 53. I imagine everything I need to know about prepping for raids and endgame dungeons can be found in guides. 
---
 First toon so I am going to do my best to pretend I know what I'm doing untill exposed lol is there anything as a priest coming to end game that you would suggest, for the most part I'll just use the wow head guides for attunement (no idea what this is right now) and what consumables I should be bringing with me. 
---
 My only concern rn is I use heal bot and I am not sure yet if I can see incoming heals from other healers which is something I would think is beneficial in raids. 
---
 Even on-top of that I have to turn off weakauras becuase I have absoly no clue how to use it and when it's on there just two sets of big whole lines on either side of me and my horse symbol covers my entire body lol I don't know wtf I did
---
It's worth 1k gold still on most servers. Don't expect random people you group with to pass on 1k gold so you can have an epic.
---
Think of it this way. If 1k gold dropped in the dungeon off a mob and everyone was rolling on it and you said "Hey guys, can I take the 1k gold so I can go buy my forors?" Would you expect anyone to pass on it for you? 
---
That's essentially what's happening here. It's not like Ironfoe or Felstriker where the only way to get it is to run the dungeon over and over and hope for a small drop chance. It's readily available to you or anyone else at all times for gold. 
---
If you want everyone to pass on it you either need to reserve it, or run with friends/guildies who understand they'll be passing it to you.
---
Westfall-Horde they go for like 200g
---
Why do you consider zandalar dead lol, it's still layered
---
Bless you sir!
---
You might be right, regardless. There are clearly huge differences between hardware based servers like those used in Vanilla, Tbc and wotlk (not entirely sure if wotlk still used inhouse hardware servers) and these new fancy cloud based ones, It's clear that the cloud based option is cheaper and inferior.
---
If you aren‚Äôt flexing on 39 strangers then what‚Äôs the point?
---
In no way is this your BIS. Barbarous is.
---
Ohh thanks for the tip! I will have to start pick-pocketing more
---
Awesome! I was gonna mail the guy some nice stuff it I got a crazy deal!   
---
Just google, YouTube, or search these forums bro. But yea I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll really be able to farm BRD at all. I think I saw something about a mage solo‚Äôing incendius but not mobs
---
That feeling of excitement is what keeps most, if not all of us playing this awesome game. The feeling that comes from things like getting an importany upgrade is addictive. But that feeling, imo, also comes from getting your epic mount, finally being able to purchase the mats for that crafted piece you've been working towards, and so on.
---
I don't think everyone getting a chance to roll on expensive BoEs is "not giving a shit about or taking away someone's excitement". Instead, I think it's excitement for the entire group, because you could all use the gold from that BoE to meaningfully progress your character.
---
Hope you see what I mean :)
---
My EST server's free xfer is for a Latino server /:
---
Obsidian edge blade dropped and I was tied with another warrior in terms of raid points. Well we roll and he wins and consumes points. Later the bonereaver dropped and I was defaulted it. I congratulated the other warrior when he won bit he never congratulated me after I won.
---
If you plan to do any amount of tanking, engineering can provide you with some extra tools for aoe threat (grenades/bombs). They are also helpful if you pull an extra mob when solo. There are also situational perks like the parachute cloak, rocket boots, and goblin jumper cables.
---
Also, potions are awesome but can be purchased on the AH and used with no profession restriction.
---
Ye strat live should be flown thru, esp with how many casters wanna do it
---
Its bis for pve until tbc
---
you didn‚Äôt rob him.  The robes are BoP so you can‚Äôt make them for other people, and you still have to sink a lot of gold into the materials to make it.
---
Dont pump crit recklessly though. If you have an item vastly overshadowing a +crit item with its AP, dont forgo it, just because it has no +crit.
---
Like deathdealer breastplate if you have cadaverous armor. In that case take cad armor for its 76AP and 0,4% crit whereas deathdealer only has 16ap and 2% crit resulting in about 45-55AP when calculated into AP.
---
As someone who has healed, tanked, and dps'ed this dungeon a thousand times, a few hints.
---
The basilisks (crocodiles) are not to be taken lightly. When possible, single them out and kill them away from other mobs. If you happen to pull more than the basilisk, focus it down first. They have a stone ability that will freeze the tank, and drop his aggro, this will cause wipes if you aren't ready for it.
---
The pyramid fight is the hardest fight in the instance (save for the optional boss, Gahz'rilla). Stay at the top of the stairs so that the healer can keep LoS, and only advance down the stairs when the NPC's indicate that they need to move forward. Mana sustain is much more important here than DPS, none of the mobs do a ton of damage, but you'll need that mana for CC purposes.
---
There will be several pauses in the waves of mobs, drink whenever possible.
---
Do NOT talk to the NPC's after the boss trolls are dead until the group is ready, as the NPC's will turn on you as the last phase of the fight. Do NOT attack the goblin, make sure that if you AoE, you do so away from the goblin. He will not attack you, and will in stead go open the path to the final boss before fleeing the instance.
---
Meh. Casual.
---
Heaps of small stuff is always better. Higher volume lower margin, that way you don‚Äôt get stuck with one or two items worth 800 gold that take ages to sell, keeping you from investing on more stuff. 
---
But if you must buy big ticket items, a shadowfang would go alright, but that‚Äôs more of a phase 3 pay off.
---
I feel like this will be the same issue I come across when I respec to disc/holy as a priest. Rn in shadow form with my gear unless a warlock fear traps me or a rogue gets the stun in me it's face melting time
---
I would have rolled on it to sell, too.
---
Oh shit! Maybe I will send him something nice!
---
just keep them sheeped, until they aren't
---
its free to make, any amount is "decent"
---
congrats dwarf brother
---
Mortal men without jobs! :p
---
Meh, demand is ever changing and time is valuable. I would use the time now and start advertising/selling.
---
I will hold your goods hostage in my mailbox for the full 30 days
---
Nope not ninjaing. BoEs are generally all needed by the group. The Rogue can sell that to buy his book or any other World Drop he needs.
---
Thanks, I just went from ‚ú≥ to ‚ùÇ
---
Fury Warrior Question:
---
* Does it matter what kind of weapon type my offhand is -&gt; i am human so is mace/sword in offhand better?
---
* Does it matter how fast my offhand is (slower = better like main hand?)
---
Unfortunately I don't get to take advantage of the five second rule as often as Id like because of how busy the server is, so spirit is less valuable than it should be
---
If you kill someone on the same level, they are able to get revenge on you and often do, no danger when you're lvl 60 :(
---
&gt; All your 1-5 points have never been said, well not by anyone sensible and for sure not en masse.
---
Ah I see you don't browse /r/wow or the retail forums.
---
That's what I make an hour lol.
---
Crazy to think that I'm only worth that much in gold.
---
Usually on the official dumpster fire fourms.
---
Not saying Reddit in particular is any less hyperbolic, but in general any blizzard game forum is a disaster.
---
There are aleways complaint forums about the most ridiculous topics you could imagine.
---
Need - will equip/use on the character in the dungeon/group. If not right then, then the moment you can use/learn. Needing for any other reason than this is a ninja move. 
---
Greed - I want the item but not to use on the character in the group. If you plan to Sell/Trade/Alt/Gift to another player you roll greed. 
---
Pass - I don‚Äôt want the item at all. I‚Äôm looking at you black diamonds...
---
Needing to sell is a selfish bitch move and should be shamed.
---
If you want to make a group that works differently than this then say so when forming the group. That way people can choose to accept that or not.
---
Hi, /u/rocknfreak

The problem with mages is that spell damage is king. You only want 3 pieces of tier 1 (wrist helm boots) tier 2 pants, the rings of spellpower, the trinket, and mageblade. (I grabbed the offhand with my mageblade, even though its technically worse I wanted the int and stam). I am the mage lead and I preordain who loot goes to before it drops (i openly explain why to everyone). The way I do it is the closer you are to preraid bis, the more likely you are to get rare drops. I have mageblade and offhand, so I havent taken a single piece of tier gear yet. It honestly works very well. I couldnt imagine running with a guild who didnt prioritize the people who work harder. I worked my ass off to earn that mageblade before I entered MC.
---
So where is my mistake?  Or did you just read the title?
---
&gt; They play combat sword for PVE now.
---
Not even remotely true. We have several rogues in full pvp specs and they're never more than 10% behind the combat rogues in dps. Molten core isn't nearly difficult enough to actually require dedicated pve specs.
---
&gt; My only concern rn is I use heal bot and I am not sure yet if I can see incoming heals from other healers which is something I would think is beneficial in raids. 
---
You will generally be assigned a group to heal.
---
Sometimes that involves a single healer for the tank, and another healer for the rest of the group; other times that means splitting it 50/50. It all depends on the raid, tank, and healer variety.
---
Doesn't the AQ40 shield overtake the Chromaggus shield?
---
Id say hunter or mage. Both are ridiculously convenient.
---
Thank you for this!
---
Dunno if I should up or downvote you due to my salty ness, either way congratz :D Spent last couple of days on these dragons for this exact roll. About 300kills/150 resets in, got one of fiery and frozen wraths, 3x of healing and a couple of the usual ones. My heart skipped when I finally saw "of Shadow .... Resistance", Resistance which supposedly has even a much lower drop rate. Just so I can easily replace it with Anathema  in a week or two, hell, I just may get the staff earlier than this.
---
Fair enough I suppose, I play oh herod so it's pretty populated there. I usually only use judgement once, sometimes twice if its really gonna take a while to kill the mob, then just auto attack with seal of command the rest of the fight to let mana regen. Also I never really use hammer of wrath, the amount of mana it uses is insane.
---
At 9am during a work day?
---
Yeah, its got strength, stamina, and that 1% crit is basically 20 points of agility. Plus it looks much better than alot of the crap at this range. Thank you for the validation!

I actually went with orc for the looks, not so much the stun resist.  I love the way they look in gear.  Animations are great!  Sadly Orc do look completely terrible on the horse so I might actually skip my epic lock quest and just buy a normal epic mount for now.  Not sure yet as I'm still a few levels off anyways.

My hunter pet has been doing this for a few days now and I do not use any macros yet. I haven't tested the passive/defensive theory but I think its worth putting a ticket in for
---
Nah, they're all horrible mutations and they don't have hooves at all. Or eyes, or livers, or brains.
---
Try googling this incredibly-common question.
---
Fair enough. I mentioned it but no one mentioned back how in line you have to be. I should‚Äôve probably just paid more attention tbh. Thanks.
---
&gt;the default behavior is to need on stuff you need, and greed if you don't need it and want to sell it
---
In my experience, this is true....until something noticeably valuable drops. Then, it's very likely that at least one person in the group is going to need.
---
Shield Spike!
---
I've heard this is done for Rank 14, but i thought maybe getting Rank 13 wouldn't be this bad.
---
That's how Europeans tend to portray themselves, yes.
---
Worst part is the guy upgrades it a week later in Scholo when I could have carried it into MC.  I dont know.  Its soul crushing sometimes.  People can be scum.
---
The biggest thing you can do for yourself is find a way to have rage at the start of the pull. Hitting rats to stay in combat, using bloodrage, etc.
---
That will let you use Sweeping Strikes, both shouts, then whirlwind. This takes a few seconds, but will give you a decent lead for when the aoe starts. Using engineering bombs to pull is also a decent choice.
---
And p1/p2 BiS. You don‚Äôt replace them til Nef, iirc.
---
It'll come with experience. I've been complimentes in my healing all while through levelling up which is a big feelsgoodman as I'm new but this raiding this sounds like a whole new beast to learn.
---
It's pretty much that bad
---
I‚Äôm 20. Hard to find time. If you‚Äôre 50 you‚Äôre fast.
---
Slightly off-topic - I miss playing shaman. Was a draenei shaman in WOLTK. I just remember facerolling in raids by dropping totems, spamming chain heal and pressing heroism when raid leader calls for it. 
---
Back to topic - you should observe what the other shaman is doing in the raid. Test out a few different methods in dungeons and raids to find out what best suit your play style. Downranking may not work for everyone. Being familiar with the boss/mob mechanics will also allow you to predict large incoming damage, and you can begin casting heal just in time for the damage.
---
In terms of mana, Nightfin soup can be a lifesaving food buff. I didn't want to level fishing or farm the fish, so I added a few fishermen in our server to my friend list to ensure I always have reasonably priced soups in inventory for boss encounters in raid. 
---
Mana potions and runes do not share cooldown. Always carry both for emergencies.

This was my original kiddo logic from back in vanilla.

Horde? Cool

I play a holy priest and its not that bad. For reference if alone (so I always have a mob alive close) I can kill about 100 mobs/hour water elemental mobs (54-57 lvl) in EPL while farming the water essences. With new mage water it could be even faster now.
---
Just equip the leftover spell damage gear from greed rolls.
---
Okay, I finally understand. thanks everyone.
---
Gold bids are fun too but gotta be super trusting. Everyone bids in gold then someone holds all the gold from the winners and at the end everyone splits the gold
---
On the other hand, the clock are just a way to make the run challanging. Without the clock everyone can finish the dungeon, because you are not forced to know your route and pull more mobs or chain pull. You also don't need full time to make it for +1 and you can finish in time  even with wipes. It all comes down to knowledge, gear and skill. For sure you dont need to get higher key than +10 for the max gear, which is pretty easy for ppl, that know what are they doing.
---
yes u can i did blud how i got last 300g for epic selling em at 50g per robe
---
I'm currently alliance in classic but I was horde from vanilla-cata before quitting, and honest I think Org is the best city. It has a feel to it that no other city does, I think it's just the open area near the bank that I miss, everyone always in that area and the duels constantly going on outside. Maybe it's just what I'm used to.
---
They're almost exactly identical in terms of mitigation. You're trading a small amount of stam for a small amount of armor. The Shield from Saph and KT are substnatially better than both of those. 
---
I think if i remember correctly, in terms of overall Value, the Chromag shield is valued at 252.2 and the AQ one is 252.8, whereas the KT one is 287+. The difference between Chromag and AQ is very very negligible.
---
The higher the value the item, the more likely someone is to ninja it. I've seen it quite a bit.
---
There is a rare that can spawn and drop a blue dagger. Had it drop in one run (of many across various alts, as I spammed it for levels). It's pretty rare to see anything good in there.
---
That does not work, at least not completely. I get a message saying something like:
---
&gt;Soandso tried to invite you to "somegoldsellingchannel1212asdas12324df".
---
&gt;But you have channel invites disabled.
---
It's like, what's the point? Why disable them if you're just going to show me the spam anyway?
---
You know you don‚Äôt have to leave bear form to skin things right?
---

---
Improved cleave looks good, but it only increases the bonus damage. Like it says hits for weapon +50. The talent only modifies the 50.
---
I have the OH.  Also never seen the MH
---
Not how hit/crit work for casters, only melee.
---
Thank you very much
---
This looks like a blast. Duo pvp, deep in enemy territory, nowhere is safe. It just makes me sad that druids don't get vanish. :(
---
If you haven't already id suggest getting leveling add-on if you want to level faster. Azeroth Autopilot + Classic Codex is a good combo
---
Farming these flasks takes longer than the time saved by using them for the run.
---
pleasure to hear that. thanks alot :) it means to me.
---
Hahah thanks. If u are getting anathema either way eventually as a spriest just dont farm this offhand if u got that luxury. Not worth imo. And ye my heart would also skip a beat seeing ‚Äùshadow resistance‚Äù üòÇ
---
Very cool
---
Remember. Theres always a bigger fish.
---
No, it's just an honorless kill, not a DK.
---
So need over greed unless it‚Äôs worth being a ninja... booooo.
---
Yeah I have my healing set for dungeons and damage set for out in the world.
---
The cap is 100%. Spell crit is a separate roll after the hit/miss roll.
---
&gt;yes u can i did blud how i got last 300g for epic selling em at 50g per robe
---
neat that you found a way to sell BoP robes bro
---
Badly hurt humans, stocky green humans, tall hunchback humans, big fat furry humans

---
Blizzard was pretty confident that 90% of the population would leave within the first few months.
---
Yeah I do know that, still though can't move forward while skinning will correct it in main post, thank you.
---
You can do things like this in BFA as well. I dropped through the Ulduar elevator many times...
---
The current content is very very easy. I was spooked before my first MC raid too (I just did tbc and wotlk as a dps) and honestly is a snooze fest.

got mine for 100g off the AH at the start of the month
---
to think i almost regretted it at the time cause that was all my money and hadnt even started saving for epic mount as 60
---
i knew it would pay itself off in short time, but never dreamed it would print 17g a day
---
Lmao
---
That‚Äôs a big ol no. 2h fury as horde is extremely good not to mention its much better for all your warriors(and rogues) if some warriors go 2h as it opens gear up.

I'm on Zandalar Tribe and I got that twice for the entire time.

You should seek another guild mate there are some that are like that

Your fucking insane the point of it need/greed system was if you need it for an upgrade or greed you want to sale
---
You need to have a chat with your tank apparently, drillborer is easily better than deflector.
---
To be fair it's easy to build a nice city like Stormwind when you don't plan on paying the bill. That's literally what happened in the lore and why Westfall is under attack by the Defias.
---
yeah i was gonna say.... tf?
---
What's giving you trouble?
---
From what I remember of vanilla, it was always possible to jump off the walls and load out of the dungeon. Even jumping on that roof to access courtyard quicker.
---
I dunno, I've seen plenty of videos of guilds/groups doing just that. Maybe it's different on your server though of course, can't speak for that.
---
60 most likely. It's all about level, you can probably get by a 60 rogue at 50-55 with 5/5 master of deception
---
Your a true hero.

Having said that, I hope you'll enjoy your Shaman! It definitely feels good, and a has a good amount of buttons available. Here's some tips:
---
* Level as Enhancement until 40. Then switch to Ele. You can heal dungeons pretty well at end game with the Ele/Resto hybrid build of 30/0/21. This build is also the go-to Ele PvP build, and with Spell Damage you blow people up super well. 
---
* The most viable role for Shaman is Healer, especially for Raids. You'll have an uphill struggle if you don't want to heal in Raids. 
---
Combat Tips:
---
* Always have a separate, Rank 1 Earth Shock keybound. This is your interrupt. 
---
* Frontload all your spells, then just autoattack for the last chunk. Try and use the 5 Second Rule as much as you can. Shamans OOM easily. 
---
* Rockbiter is mathematically the best Weapon Spell. Use it when you solo, do not use it in dungeons or raids. (Though the other Weapon Spells are more fun imo, the damage is close regardless).
---
* Lightning Bolt, and Lightning Shield to a lesser degree, are very mana efficient in terms of damage.
---
* Be careful of patrolling mobs and totems. They will destroy them, then come for you.
---
&gt; It has a feel to it that no other city does
---
Yep, that of a trailer park
---
SFK for sure
---
We‚Äôll also probably never get this sort of thing again unless they do server resets post-naxx. I really hope they take this slow.

That would require you to get some Flameguards to drop! 6 weeks of raids and not a single one yet!
---
Probably due to neither of us getting angry over meaningless stuff. Also photo was taken to send to my wife, so easier to use that.

Expecting them to heat it might be an overestimation.

Hey how's the population like at Pagle, for the Horde?

It‚Äôs not better gear, it‚Äôs gold, if 1=x then what is x?
---
The issue with discussing it when it drops is the guy that actually needs it sees his BiS, gets excited, then has to sit and watch 4 people do mental gymnastics to justify ninjaing the item from him.
---
The idea that you can do it only on items that sell for a lot is really just you putting a price on being a jerk.
---
Yeah the only currently available item I would use in place of it is the Mana Igniting Cord if you're lucky enough to get that. Other than that just stick with Ban'thock all of phase one.
---
Good for you for enjoying the game, I lost all interest after doing MC once on my warrior (and buying epic mount), thought about lvling other alts but realized that it consumes to much time and I can do something more useful instead.
---
The problem could be that they are alliance.. which means you can get straight fucked by undead rogues if they open on you and you don‚Äôt save death coil for when they WOTF. This person should also consider going engineering for extra mobility, stuns, and the engineering net. Helps a lot with survivability
---
I've just been spamming SM with my 2 rl buddies: Warrior (Me), Rogue and a Mage. We're on Cath now. I haven't quested since lvl 30 iirc \[lvl 38 now\] and if I wanted to jump back in I was thinking Duskwood / STV. Or should I just keep spamming Cath?
---
Tanks can't generate much threat while she's in the air, so the DPS ends up higher on the threat meters than the tanks. So the tanks end up having to rebuild nearly all of their threat.
---
I MT everything outside of MC and Onyxia as resto without issue.
---
Yeah, we all know this about rogues already.

Coming from RuneScape you learn the value of Effort VS GPM. ZF is that sweet spot for me. Could make more in DM but that's more effort I'm not willing to exert.

Whoops, meant to say three rollers.
---
Shadow priest sounds right up your ally,  possibly also enh shaman if you're horde,  but they fall off a bit in end game
---
I'm horde on KromCrush and I die everytime I try to enter the spire. I'm sure horde outnumber ally so this isn't a balance thing. This is just our server fighting it out constantly. They do make PVE servers. Maybe go that route?

Your mistake is that 2H fury does less DPS then DW fury as you get more gear. But if you want to stick with 2H then yes it is probably BIS.
---
I mean you can do vendor scans with Auctioneer, and you can turn off plugins if you don't want them. For example, I turned off Auctioneer/TSM but I'm still using Enchantrix.

I like the listing function in aux, especially how I can click an existing listing to undercut it.

I just do lashers because I dont have to respec out of arcane frost. Would it be worth respecing to do zf once I feel comfortable being in deep frost for raids?
---
yup Blizzard clearly doesn't care though. They gave us some dogshit garbage ass servers and called it Classic.
---
Do you know about downranking, 5 second rule for mana regen, what plus healing actually does and how much each spell gets from it?
---
You're saying that regardless of my talents, if I simply put my ret gear back on I'll be able to stand my ground outside dungeons?
---
I'm horde and we get killed consistently too. It's just a warzone.

Damn already going for 250. I'd take it now. I bough one on my server for 25g the other day. Doubt it goes up much past 250.

---
So please looking at some of the best alliance guilds recent raids. Like I said pallies and priests are close. Priests beat them out by a small  margine because ya'll don't have relics yet. My logs don't lie I just proved you with 3 logs. If you'd like a full analysis of each individual fight go ahead and go in depth. As for the responses, I've shown you proof that pallies are not superior to priests in any way shape or form, and equallly skilled players will compete on the charts. 
---
Good talk have a nice day.
---
Similar situation as you. I quit my Druid and started a rogue because the Druid was too self-reliant. I like that rogue needs/benefit from gear, from professions, first aid, cooking, fishing all that stuff. As a Druid, you really don‚Äôt need it. And also melee dps as Druid is boring compared to warrior and rogue. 
---
Helping people as rogue: if you see a pally fighting a mob while running passed him, you just give a 2 second burst speeding up his kill by a minute haha. Much more valuable than a motw buff.
---
\^ the party has to respect this, if there's another skinner, you can take turns, which helps w/ that slow time.
---
You can disable it
---
 No idea what you are trying to say, asking for the bare minimum addons that makes it possible to clear raid is not the same with ninjaing or griefing, and yes it not ops business to tell what other people can use or cant use. If they want to use an lfg addon because its annoying to spam the lfg channel for 1hour for a group then let them use it and if there is more people who use it than those who dont then its a needed addon maybe you are the minority and in democracy the majoritys opinion always win the same in games.
---
Horde rools, Alliance drools
---
Ehhh I'm not a huge fan of that rule for pugs. I find that if that rule is set at the beginning, people will start to drop from the raid after the first wipe if they have already gotten a piece of gear.
---
I believe Dire Maul is not a patch 1.12 dungeon
---
I was denied :(
---
Warcraft logs should be deleted as it is absolutely pointless in classic and promotes a retail-mentality
---
Change my mind
---
it's possible this stuff will go down in price at first as people hoard them before to try and turn profits up right at phase 2 start

This happened yesterday, our guild was talking about The Unicorn Band and then a few minutes later while questing in SG it dropped.
---
Sigh so I'm not crazy? I lay down totems then the tank rushes in out of range and stays there. Ok ill move the totems and use up all the mana I just drank for -_- 
---
I get keeping the instance moving but ffs it's only pulling back 5-10ft
---
Less failed attempts
---
You sound like a ninja.
---
18 per on my server. One day I high rolled 6 of them in 30 minutes
---
No fucking way you've done 900 runs.  If yuo're quick it will take about an hour.  900 hours is 37.5 DAYS of playtime.  Just in strath.  Let's add another 10 for leveling and miscalaenous stuff (other dungeons, downtime, travel), and you would of had to play 48 DAYS of play time in the 64 days classic has been out.  
---
64 days 
---
- 7/hrs per day for doing things other than wow (including sleep /eating / hygiene)  = ~19 days.
---
64 - 19 = 45 days worth of time available for you to play wow if you take out sleep and other things.  
---
You're telling me you've played wow MORE than is possibly avaible, just in strath, to do 900 runs?
---
Because there are other things to spend money on in the game. Take your epic mount, that costs more than any BoE.
---

At least better than questing as holy.

Yep!

---
Maybe the twinking rush is already well underway on my server then? I have seen at least one twink guild advertising for people to be fair.
---
I don‚Äôt see where anyone asked about rank 1, am I blind? Regardless, I‚Äôve answered your question. Whether or not that value constitutes ‚Äúa lot‚Äù is subjective.
---
I was so tempted to roll Pally as my main as it's always been my favourite class in any RPG, but after reading about being shoehorned into wearing a dress and healing as well as the myriad of problems the other 2 specs have I decided on rogue. If they ever do TBC servers I will 100% be re-rolling to belf paladin as I feel it's the most aesthetic class ever.
---
Don't feel bad, I suck at pvp and as a rogue I have dropped mages 6+ levels above me. My main is a mage and I have the easiest time taking down warriors.
---
That doesn't solve the problem of someone "needing" on a purple BoE they're going to use for 2 levels.  Everyone Needing does.
---
Balance on KromCrush is actually good. OP just want's the fighting to stop and that isn't going to happen.
---
A lot of them are considered "boss mobs" with a skull, these count as 63's.
---
WOOOOOOOSH

12+ years playing this game and still doesn't know how to print screen.
---
Lmaoooo
---
Levels?
---
Okay, thanks for the feedback man! I really appreciate it.
---
Within 5 yards I don't think you will sneak past level 60's comfortably without talents or racial, even if you are level 60.
---
Even 10 yards I think would be tough without any talents.
---
In my opinion, you should play what you enjoy.  There are tons of guilds out there, and if your guild is choosing a pug feral druid over you then screw em.
---
&gt; Is it worth it to respec to Prot so I can solo farm lashers in DM? 
---
 Her fireball lowers the person threat and she targets the highest on the threatmeter. A smart tank will have 3-4 whelps hitting him to gain rage so he can spam revenge and sunders on onyxia during p2. This ensures he is high on threat and should only get 0-2 people killed before tank has her again.
---
I haven‚Äôt heard of those addons so I‚Äôll definitely check them out
---
Seconded. SFK has a great story based almost entirely around silverpine forest
---
Not quite all.  You can't 10 man BRD, Dire Maul, Strath or Scholo.
---
Yeah that's not an ideal situation. Surely that is a shitty position to be in all around.
---
Laggy, but not frozen. Lag &gt; frozen.
---
What I don't understand is why there is so much advertisement. Don't they have to pay for each account they set up to advertise on? Banning those should be a significant increase in costs to the gold sellers.
---
that¬¥s super relaxing
---
Gotcha. Well the +5 sword skill better be worth it offering my flips and sneak Nelf racials for it.
---
Big dick dps obviously.
---
It‚Äôs a shame that it still shows that they invited you, and then you blocked it in the chat.  But still better than having it pop up mid screen and having to manually decline.
---
I think you're way overdoing it. You should really only bring enough consumes for the raid and the rest can be left in the bank. Even like an enchanting rod you don't need on you at all times. How often do you really enchant on the go? Really all this comes down to is planning well so you know what you're going to use. Although you could also save yourself a ton of slots by having your non-tank spec be a Resto spec. :P
---
And I don't know what you have in your bank, but if the consumes is anything like your inventory, you need to chill out and plan better. You don't need tons of extra shit unless you're using it right now an some realistically you won't need at all. But if you really want to be ready for everything, just keep stuff on an alt and mail your main when you need it.
---
I got to 50 then i realized i have done it all and there was no surprise for me.   
---
Maybe i'll be back IF arena is released
---
Yeah, stealthed in as a druid, killed one guy in the upper ring, got Atal'ai spaulders of agi/sta (is it "the monkey?").  Basically bis until an MC drop.  Stupid lucky.
---
Been running MC since week 3...not one Brutality Blade/Viskag/Bonereavers/Spinal Reaper/OEB/Onslaught girdle to date...just cleared last night and DE'd about 7 pieces of druid loot and got our 3rd mageblade....CMONNNN
---
I get one a night on a "full" server, but if I get on before work to post to AH or do a quest real fast I will get 2 in 10 minutes. Some sort of addon or automated process to pester online players.
---
Yeah, having a 2 second delay on everything is "zero issues", for sure
---
&gt; I don't like needing leather away from druids + rogues 
---
You're the real MVP
---
So the R13 set has 3% hit - I think the idea is coming up with that remaining 6% from other gear slots could involve sacrificing stats on some pieces to get that hit that you wouldn‚Äôt have to sacrifice if you wear lionheart.
---
For rogues you either want sword or daggers for your specialization. Mace for pvp
---
Thought I saw dagger
---
Maybe, but healing meters also make healers spam flash heal to top the charts when it would be much more mana efficient to use stronger heals
---
It really depends. I'd say it's about 10g per hour for a trio of 3.
---
Mining and herbalism bump it up from there, and Ofc there's always the chance for books and boes
---
Thank you!!
---
I wanna say that this is false information. 
---
I never remembered it being that way in Vanilla, and from my own research this seems like something that happened on private servers which wouldn't surprise me at all.
---
I could be wrong though, but I'm almost positive BoE epics do NOT drop from rogue specific junkboxes. I've gone through thousands, have only ocme across a handful of greens and some recipes

---
Interested to know which guild this was as I'm on Herod Horde as well and want to know who I should be wary of, PM me
---
Honestly I should. I will see what their reaction is I guess, since I'm pretty new to the guild and I think they know the other feral longer than me. I'm okay with being a back up to a guildie but the fact that the other person holding the spot is not in guild is kinda weird to me.
---
I guess I should have added at above level 40:    
---
At levels 40 and above, the quest XP will start to scale down after you are 6 or more levels above the quest level, even while the quest is still green.   
---
You can read about it [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/acqxup/til_that_quests_always_give_the_same_xp_except_if/)

You can't COD wrapped items any longer. I believe that was already changed before TBC launched.

Lionheart is a shitload easier to get than rank 13.

Just fyi.
---
I am a hunter and agree with you. 
---
A mage, even bad, can't fuck up as much as a bad hunter. Heck, I'm the first to say most mages are awful but I still love to have at least one in a party because of their AoE dmg capability.
---
Insane class played by the most inept people. But  still manage to do incredible dps while being undergear and disgusting at game mechanics.
---
Think my next char is going to be a mage. So I can get spitted on whatever character I'm playing heh.
---
&gt; 2h dps is much more viable 
---
Sure, but as time goes you'll become less and less competitive
---
&gt;If you have 9% hit without Lionheart
---
Means you're most likely using sub-par pieces to reach your hit cap, instead of getting a helm that gives you both hit and crit.
---
Getting hit gear means you normally "sacrifice" damage (AP, or STR, or crit, or all three). Lionheart gives you everything you would ever want. And allows you to pick pure damage pieces instead of getting hit (Quickstrike ring over Accuria, for example)
---
You are understanding the mechanics properly, but just not why Lionheart Helm is weighted so heavily in gear lists.
---
This is even easier later when you have eye of hakkar from zg, drake talon pauldrons etc
---
Was healing a 55 warrior in DM west, think he could barely hit things and wasn't keeping aggro well
---
Yeah but who cares atm
---
And then you have situations like mine, where I joined raid teams with another guild on the condition that my guild would get bindings, their guild would get Eye of Sulfuras.
---
When bindings dropped, all of a sudden the situation changed and they started saying how they should get it and whatnot, had to stand my ground and defend my guild and luckily they handed it over, but continued to be hostile to me for the rest of the raid night, also tried to impose that our MT shouldn't be eligible for gear anymore since they already got Bindings.
---
Sadly we did not continue to work with them past that week.
---
Haha while part of that is true, I‚Äôm actually not handicapping the group, as stated before I‚Äôm making the group work efficiently. We don‚Äôt need that dps to dps as hard, my actions aren‚Äôt forcing them to dos faster in anyway whatsoever so that‚Äôs where you are wrong imo. I re-speced holy last night and the game is a joke easy now. Ready for some raiding to be challenged
---
Hi Sir, I'm your healer and if we if we wipe because I've wasted my mana healing your sorry ass and don't have it available when the tank needs it - that's on you.  Or I let you die, and then you "top" no DPS charts at all.
---
And yes, when I see DPS warriors in significantly-leather gear, they immediately go to the ***bottom*** of my healing priority list, like warlocks constantly shitting their hp for mana.
---
Love it
---
True, the fights are easy enough that the healers rarely run out
---
hey you still got an A in arithmetic so thats good
---
The other feral have been raiding with the guild for a while I think, so they are not a pug. But I find it weird he's not in the guild already. I fully intend to tell them no, I just want to avoid all the potential drama haha.
---
can't*
---
I would move that one point in imp arcane shot to either imp concussive or hunters mark. Aimed and Arcane shot share a CD and you will be using aimed on CD for PvE.
---
Interesting.  We've had to go to the MT every time.  Do you guy burn phase 1 really fast or do you take it slow?  If you are going slow, the tank might be taking extra wing buffets that reduce his/her overall threat cap which puts the OT at a higher threat potential?
---
I recommend moonglow resto.
---
Drugs plus Gaming equals Escapism  
---
Very good for grinding on Mmorpgs, not much for your social life.
---
They really are.
---
exactly
---
Yea, I think the OP needs to expand his/her gear choices. You can drop hit elsewhere. As far as stats go, lionheart packs a lot of value into 1 slot. I'd rather drop hit from boots or a ring or shoulders and swap in something with more AP and crit in those slots
---
I can't believe it's just been 2 months.  Feels like it has been out forever.
---
Just selfish AF.  It's the 2019s, 'mere' narcissism is out, solipsism is all the rage.
---
this is one of that me laugh thank you
---
The hitcap is 6% with 305 weapon skill which you should have no matter what. Even for duelwield, if you are abusing the heroic strike "bug" that isn't going to be fixed, the hitcap stays at 6% with any hit above that being veryvery weak. So yeah you can replace lionheart in classic fairly easily in lategame.
---
That‚Äôs not the deathcharger mount by the way it‚Äôs a joke
---
Thats different instance IDs, which has been in the game since the beginning....not phasing.
---
People who play Classic have no want or need to go to WoW even with a new patch of expansion. If anything they could release BWL now though and PVP.
---
Note, you'll still receive a message in your feed about who and what you've been invited to. And that the request has been blocked.
---
Did you just get ganked?
---
We had War DPS, War Tank, Hunter, Demo, Druid Heal
---
And seeing as how there were a fixed number of ranked people per week, and our servers are *far* more populated than they were when the honor and ranking systems were introduced, there will be even more competition for those top spots.
---
Just pointing out its minimum wage where you live. In some country's a days pay in us/canadian dollors will be their monthly income. So it could be very lucrative for people in poorer country's.
---
TY so much.  I have no idea how I didn't find this on my own.
---
I get 3-4 of these an hour some days.
---
Not mine but:
---
Lok'tar Ogar, brother!
---
Let me hype you up about the Horde, right good and proper.
---
You don't want chaos? Great. There is no chaos in the Horde. The Horde is not about chaos. It's about brutal efficiency. Orgrimmar's buildings are as they are because they get the goddamned job done. The Forsaken literally clawed their city out of rock just to fucking survive, man. You know how much pain and anguish exists within a Forsaken's mind, having achieved sentience after enslavement to the Lich King? A whole hell of a lot, I tell you what, but they've got a job to do, and that job is survival (and pure, unbridled vengeance).
---
Survival is the name of the game. The Horde is a band of merry misfits, just trying to survive in a hostile world. The Orcs didn't want to be here. They were literally brainwashed by a bunch of fucking demons that shattered their homeworld and drove them insane, but they broke free of their bonds and, as a reminder of their former enslavement, impaled Mannoroth's big fucking head on a sixty-foot-tall pike. The Darkspear Trolls, maligned and hated by their kin for the grave sin of daring to help non-Trolls, eke out a meager existence on a pile of small islands. The Tauren find peace with nature in a small enclave surrounded on all sides by desert. The Forsaken, cursed with their very existence, struggle just to keep on not-really-living and not-really-dying.
---
They find brotherhood and camaraderie in their shared suffering, and they fight for honor and the hope of a future prosperity.
---
What the fuck does the Alliance have to offer? Ancient, decadent cities of their long-dead ancestors that they claim credit for, when in recent generations their legacy has been little more than xenophobia and racism? When Garithos, made leader of a full regional contingent by sheer chance, utilized his role to damn the High Elves and let the Sunwell fall? Or perhaps when the forces of Stormwind, instead of focusing their hatred against a literal intergalactic army of demons, decided that it was really the Orcs' fault that the First War happened, and proceeded to enslave them and put them in concentration camps? So blind to incompetence and nepotism in their ranks that the highest elite ranks of Stormwind host not only the daughter of Deathwing but the nascent Twilight Father? And the Gnomes and Dwarves tinkering away in a mountain, giving fuck-all attention to anything north of Grim Batol? Or maybe the prissy and ancient Night Elves, screwing about in a magical tree in the north of nowhere, so incompetent in their racial history that they lost both Azshara and Nordrassil? Well of Eternity kaputt and all? And despite having millennia-old expertise with the machinations of the Burning Legion, they still don't prepare properly for Archimonde's assault? Nor does Dalaran, when the Kirin Tor are besieged "without warning", having conveniently not only ignored Medivh's warnings but also ignored the fact that he was possessed by Sargeras in the first place and also they're a bunch of goddamned super wizards? Might as well just put a big ol' bubble around their city and pretend they don't exist so that they don't have to help out any of the besieged citizens of Lordaeron.
---
The Alliance's legacy is inaction, their birthright unearned and their morality tainted by base prejudice. They lay about, and when threats arise, they continue to lay about until it's too late to do anything but damage control, and then they blame their problems on the funny green fellows and throw them in camps. They're corrupted by the malaise of prosperity, and their shining cities belie their slow downfall.
---
Who do you want to be associated with? An army of downtrodden, abused underdogs fighting for the right to live and assembled through fast bonds of wartime brotherhood, or a bloated bureaucracy of racist, snobby malcontents who abandon their allies to the Scourge and pretend themselves wise merely because of the age of the bricks beneath their feet? I prefer the underdogs. For honor! For the Horde!
---
Worth trying, but usually this happens when an officer is a close friend of the non-guild member, and the other player considers himself a member of both guilds. If that's the case, they will get priority.
---
Can you read? I said 10 gold per hour if you do this shit on any off the bigger servers. You wont see a single pool for hours, thanks to all the dipshits making it completely worthless.
---
We did this, we stopped pulling, had everyone jump up and down on the hound til it was looted, and it never got looted. Some people just like to watch the world despawn.
---
Unless you flag yourself for PVP, you can just run right through all those players....   Right? lol
---
During peak times on Sulfuras (US) I see it 1-3 times an hour
---
Those screenshot artsy posts are horrible to be honest.
---
Download atlasloot. Perfect for this.
---
Shield? Dude it's MC. You can DW tank it and just zerg down the bosses.
---
Wow that to first video really puts it in perspective. What‚Äôs blizzards deal here
---
No one wants to admit they ate nine cans of ravioli...
---
Well, yes and no. Mighty rage potions are obviously better, but they are also more expensive. 
---
Gromsblood isn't the easiest herb to come by and it takes 3 of them to make 1 potion. 
---
Whereas a Great Rage Potion only costs 1 Large Fang and 1 Kingsblood. That is super cheap! Sure you lose out on like... 15 rage and bonus str for 20 seconds, but I think the benefits of saving money is better. 
---
That being said, if you can stockpile Gromsblood now you could find a market for it, but I think more people will gravitate to the Great Rage potion simply for the simplicity of the recipe.
---
The longer it takes for them to get to 60 the more time your faction has before they start competing for open world resources relevant for end game, not just nodes but mobs.
---
A BoE drop is worth exactly the same to all. A BoP usually is not. Some classes have more good (really expensive) BoEs. Does this mean they should have loot priority over another class with not as many just because they're broke?
---
Not only would you have to play 12+ Hours every day, vuy you have to be in the top group in the server to be able to get the honor/hour required. Not possible for 99% of us.
---
Druid tank Furor question. Why the hell is furor almost in every build what I see? Sutch useless talent for tanking. I mean I get it you get some rage but I my opinion the MoW is like 1000% beter for tanking. I am wrong?
---
But you only pay if you actually accept it right? Opening it shouldn't be a problem just delete everything that isn't from alts or specifically asked for?
---
Bear would kill for trinket like that.
---
Where can I find the 3700 armor value you‚Äôre referencing? Would be good to have handy.
---
Honestly, I don't remember.  Last time I did Onyxia was like 13-14 years ago.  I don't remember threat being an issue in the p2/p3 transition back then.  Then again, I was 15 and very bad at the game back then.
---
They're buying Oily Blackmouth for 6g? On my server it sells for 40s :(
---
(I love fishing and sell 4-6 stacks daily)
---
Lots of minerals I can't use yet because my mining is a lot higher than my blacksmithing.
---
yeah that's fair! I just assume people going for ranks won't care about cash lol
---
You idiots literally think MC is the only raid.  
---
YOU NEED A TAUNT FOR 3 BOSSES in BWL.   
---
YOU NEED A TAUNT FOR NAXX.  
---
NO, THIS THREAT NUKE DOES NOT REPLACE A TAUNT IN THE FIGHTS YOU ACTUALLY NEED TAUNT.  
---
SO NO, THIS THREAT NUKE IS NOT A TAUNT. ITS NOT LIKE A TAUNT.  PALADINS STILL CANT TANK THESE FIGHTS.
---

You are misguided.

How to make money as a tank be patient. Join looking for group but the tv watch sport or a film. Wait till you see lfm strat live tank. Wait till they have been asking for a while.(shortage of tanks and drops no tank loot) say you will tank for all the orbs. They say yes you go if they say no. Go back to watching tv if they are still asking in 10 minutes ask again. There is money in orbs

Do you mean he actually ninja looted it or he outrolled you?
---
Why cover his name?
---
Really it depends on what you're trying to do with them and figuring out the limitations. Wowhead has a macro's section under each class that's a good start. There's pretty limitless things you can do. One thing I recommend everyone do in classic is to just create a macro for all of your basic skills with /startattack thrown in.
---
\#showtooltip Sinister Strike
---
/Startattack
---
/cast Sinister Strike
---
This does multiple things, First it makes it so if you swap targets, you can hit your sinister strike button to automatically start attacking them, even if you don't have energy. Also it makes it so you're always using the highest ranks of your spells and abilities. This is especially useful while leveling as some skills won't update to the newest rank on your action bar unless you replace them from your spell book. This will automatically cast the highest version available.
---
Another useful one for most classes is to incorporate /dismount into your abilities that you're going to use to start combat or you will want to get off of your mount instantly for. For example a useful one for a rogue would be something like.
---
\#showtooltip Stealth
---
/stopcasting
---
/dismount
---
/Cast !Stealth
---
This will make it so if you're riding along on your mount and see a threat you can spam your stealth button to automatically dismount and stealth at the same time. It will also automatically stop anything you may have casting or any attack that may put you back into combat before you can stealth. 
---
You can also set up multiple keys to do the same thing depending on your current state. So for example you could do 
---
/cast [stealth] Pick Pocket
---
/cast [stealth] Kidney Shot
---
/cast [nostealth] Sinister Strike
---
In this case everything in the bracket is a modifier. So it's going to go are you in stealth? okay we're going to pickpocket and then kidney shot, like in the previous macro. Are you not in stealth? okay we're going to sinister strike. Now you have a one button macro that will be commonly used both in and out of stealth.
---
Sorry if I rambled a bit, I haven't really found any comprehensive website that shows all of the macro possibilities but if you google (class) wow classic macros you'll find some forum posts and various resources people have came up with.
---
I play a lvl 30 warrior and have all greens, I can barely kill a mob my lvl. The only way I get a smile on my face is by punching and killing someone 4 lvls lower. I don‚Äôt have enough money to upgrade my skills, I don‚Äôt have enough money to buy better gear, and I barely have enough to buy food and repair.
---
The factions are at war.  The party that can prevent his enemy from reinforcing and resupplying himself is often the winner of a war.  Killing a low rank player until he gets frustrated and quits/re-rolls on a different server means one less character that makes it 60 to gear up and oppose your faction.
---
You're right but that's a very small percentage of the total player base. I never said EVERYBODY WILL QUIT.
---
I mentioned having atlas loot and thinking that it was off which one are you using? Mine doesn‚Äôt show drop chances but wowhead lists them.
---
This. I'm in literally almost the exact same situation. Would prob be around 38 but decided to reroll from a 33 priest and now sitting at 20 on my druid. What server are you on?
---
Yeah that's a gquit if I ever saw one
---
Consistently pulls aggro in MC != Taunt.  
---
Like how stupid can you be to think that "I pulled aggro with it in MC" means "its like a taunt".  
---
You have clearly never tanked any of the content in this game that actually requires a taunt. Or you wouldn't be arguing. This shit is just dumb players who don't even understand the value of taunt in raids past MC.
---
How do I make money as a paladin then? Dungeons are too slow on my server.
---
I feel WoW really failed the Alliance races. In example, I really dislike Dwarves in WoW because they come across as comedic relief. Their running animation makes me angry. Personality-wise, I really prefer Dark Iron Dwarves. Gnomes are quite polarizing and Night Elves are a case of "murdered by adaptation". In WC3 they were awesome, but in WoW they are a joke. Fierce Dwarves, fierce Night Elves and fierce Gnomes would make the Alliance a lot more interesting overall.
---
I generally only do this after I've been leveling an alt and some jerkoff decided I was a good target. I log over and decimate the area. The horde then start avoiding that area and I can level in peace again.

That was so convincing.

It happens every now and then. Just curious what goes through the heads of these neanderthals.

Do you think your experience in the dominant faction is comparable to playing on the side being dominated?
---
You still get the invites even after blocking channel invites

But we are directly talking about taunting in MC? 
---
LOUD NOISES
---
This is more an infantry/combat arms adage (applied to all services in a combat role) than specifically to spec ops. Even the lowliest 11b in the Army has heard this.  
---
(not trying to say OMG UR RONG just trying to add that it is a traditional saying readily used, as opposed to simply SOC).
---
It is a combo of a meme from letterkenny, a Canadian tv show, and the idea that hunters bring wolves to raid just for furious howl but their wolf (or dog) sits passive for buff while not being able to use them for damage because pets die too easy or aggro extra packs and wipe the raid, so hunter "Hold them" in passive mode
---
Bought a surface pro 3 with an i3 and 4gb ram that runs classic. Not at high resolutions but it runs okay at 30-45 fps. Just 200 bucks and you‚Äôre there.
---
Some people have more than one group of friends.
---
No I gotcha I understand. I have it happen to me too. I hate it. But when I do it I love it. Can't tell ya what goes through my head lol. I'm a victim and a perpetrator I guess.... smh
---
No shipping tool is a separate feature
---
Can‚Äôt believe people didn‚Äôt realize this
---
Typical mage. Just kick him and find a replacement in under a minute. Easy. 
---
No need to leave group as the tank you should be leading the group anyway.
---
Yeah it's kind of wack. If I see Horde doing it, I will usually call them out or tell them to take it easy. Usually they reply "alliance is scum, we have to kill them."
---
I have always played on PvP and I've never mindlessly killed a lowbie. I only start fights with people I think stand a chance of beating me. No mid-mob attacks, no half-life-missing attacks, no low-level attacks. Though, I'm rarely given the same consideration :) I like to enjoy the game and lose fairly. Recently I've been taking my chances at 1v1s as a holy priest in Tanaris and it has been a blast.
---
I like my warlock. Sure you can play warlock fairly easy. But if you want to utilize everything it‚Äôs fun and a lots of buttons.
---
I haven‚Äôt heard a single player say ‚ÄúYeah man once the new expansion comes out I‚Äôm outtie‚Äù. However I do agree we need more content, people are already raid logging.
---
If the guild is prioritising a non guildie over you for a preferred spec then this guy can either join the guild or you can leave.
---
You‚Äôre paying the same fee as everyone else, this is a game not a job so you shouldn‚Äôt feel obliged to play a role you don‚Äôt want to.
---
Gooood gooooood I feel the rage grow within you. Just wait until you're level 60 and let that anger pour out into the innocent lowbies who are just trying to get about their day. Feeding off their hatred as you just know they're cursing your name as they run back to their bodies in spirit form!
---
&gt; Without the clock everyone can finish the dungeon, because you are not  forced to know your route and pull more mobs or chain pull.  
---
yes thats what I want.
---
the challenge should be to kill the mobs and bosses, and to do that you should need to talk to your teammates and plan pulls instead of rushing it as fast as possible
---
yea i use my pvp set for farming, currently just the necrophile set with some other stam items
---
came here for this fuckin comment
---
I'm leveling 5 characters at the same time, and crafting on all of them.  Everybody works at their own pace.
---
People can't actually agree on a norm for this.
---
I also notice this
---
Gotta murder all those gnomes. :)
---
No , you guys are saying this is "basically a taunt", not that its " good enough " in MC. 
---
This conversation was never restricted to MC.
---
This is super dramatic lol but if you're enjoying shaman have at er!
---
-‚ÄúWhat did it take?‚Äù
---
-‚ÄúEeeeeeverything‚Äù
---
Maybe it's just me, but I refuse to target s lower leveled player. If it's no challenge then it's not fun, plus I know that player is just trying to level just like me. Regardless of faction.
---
I might go a week with none, then get 4 an hour for about 8 hours, then nothing again for a week.
---
It‚Äôs sort of the reasoning that bullies at school have. More than likely their father or parental figure was bullied at home or beaten and took out their frustrations on the kids at school, then later in life when they have kids they take it out on them which in turn has their kids bully the kids in school to vent their misery or frustration. In classic wow these players were bullied and ganked while leveling so now that they are adults ‚Äúlevel 60‚Äù the cycle repeats itself and they finally get to take out their revenge on the low level players much like how they were bullied and ganked early on
---
Thank you! Sounds really interesting and will definitely read up some more about Macros ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
It still pops up the message saying that someone tried to invite you to (channel name)
---
Bro why are you posting. I don't like your opinions so clearly you're not a 'legitimate' account
---
Nothing happened wtf.
---
I have enchanting and currently on my server LBS are going for 2.5g and GE ess are 3.5g each.  The boss greens are worth around 6-7g once DE (vs \~1.5 vendor).
---
Nice
---
Buffs lets go!
---
at least 4gb of RAM in 1 azure vm per server with no redundancy and 100mb luns each
---
*create more moonwells*
---
I agree with everything except switch the mediocre races with the sub par races.
---
I think good and trusted friends are more valuable than any individual piece of loot. Social bonds are what power both fun and group content, and hey even if you miss out for now there's always a chance that continuing with the same friends will distribute things down the line.
---
I'm being given ideal circumstances, because I'm that one that's been stalking you, and I'm the one opening you. I know you have fancy skills. So do I. The problem for you is that you've been opened up and you have to use your skills to survive, and I get to use mine to counter them. FD all you want, my vanish is back off cooldown and I'm more than happy to use Ambush instead of Backstab to finish you off.
---
Yeah 40 or maybe even a 80 vs 80. Nothing like this buddy.
---
Ditto, please pass his twitch along as well if he's cool with it
---
Yup, gonna see how we doing this lockout and if nothing change im gonna just gquit, since arguing with leaders just didnt work out...  Im getting tired of it
---
I only do this after I get killed once after a single alliance kills me I spend the next 4-5 hours ganking anyone I see ... it brings me happiness.
---
Loot drama sounds bad, but it really shows you the person behind the computer screen when people do things like this. I personally would rather keep this system over Personal Loot, mostly because it makes me feel good when I'm playing with equally honorable, patient people.
---
Idk about ninja, but I have 0 issues with rolling on leather pieces. There‚Äôs like 2 pieces of plate that have any hit or crit on them. Even worse, there are almost no upgrades in MC for a Fury warrior at all. Until BWL comes out, the majority of my BIS is dungeon leather.
---
Lol what is this video even showing then ? Anyone can hold aggro in ony phase 1.
---
Sometimes - you find reminders that there is good; that it isn't all bad news or sound-bytes replaying the worst. Sometimes you get little beacons that remind you that sharing - however meager or small - is an extension of kindness that breaks up the dark spaces. Even if is only through a video-game interface ;)
---
This should legit just be off bu default
---
Warrior with a shaman for grounding totem to soak up the sacrifice on the satyr boss seems to be the strat for horde
---
Ok, thanks a lot!
---
That's great but oeb is no bre!
---
See this to me makes perfect sense. It's way more fun when both sides are challenged.
---
I keep my 60 parked where my alts are questing. If you kill me i will switch toons and raise hell until I'm bored. Could be 20 minutes could be 2 hours
---
It's true that it's a cost issue. Hosting on-prem servers with your own hardware is a huge time and cost sink. You need your own data center, network, people on standby in case of disk failures, and a plethora of other things.
---
No company in their right mind starts their own server park in 2019. Servers hosted by Google/Amazon are just much, much more robust.
---
The thing is, even Google has not yet 100% achieved vertical scalability. You can easily scale up and down the number of nodes that you run, but you cannot easily scale down the resources of each individual node. This is a problem when each game server is hosted on 1 node: you either always pay for peak capacity, or you pay less and have lag/queues during peak hours.
---
I imagine the problem here is that all people are doing AoE spells. So the number of spell damage calculations increase quadratically with the number of players. If you want to solve by adding server resources, it's actually going to cost real money and not just a little bit. I think it's an engine limitation and it may be solvable with more clever algorithms or optimizations.
---
That's reportable.
---
As a rogue pickpocket is like ideal but boring, you can watch shows and stuff though so that's a bonus.
---
On a private server I would make a route from Western plague lands all the way up to eastern scouting chests, think I was running into about 15 spawn locations on average. Tons of enchanting Mats and potential boe blue.
---
AoE grinding on a mage maybe an alt to consider,   same with some alternate classes for solo dungeon bossing.
---
Nah, it was taken
---
tl;dr
---
Lol I was 12 or 13 and was absolutely terrible but I did help my guild down Rag and Ony every week. I also dont remember threat issues but to be fair I was doing some stupid shit in raid. I have a specific memory of a Rag kill where I used Moonfire on Rag to help with dps while randomly putting rejuvenation on people that got knocked back. In fact I'm sure I put Moonfire on probably every boss fight lmao
---
I went after both, so where exactly are you in this argument?
---
Shield spike, and shield swap once you've established good enough threat.
---
On raid bosses it‚Äôs huge. There‚Äôs like almost no plate with hit or crit on it right now.
---
Couldn't think of anything worse than this. Even playing a rogue. I'll happily take on players my level.
---
Currently level 52 lock, and with the removal of layering on Grobb, I‚Äôve having a hard time leveling efficiently. Everywhere I go there seems to be 60s farming all the mobs. 
---
What are some good less-populated questing/grinding spots to get these last few levels?
---
15 year old game that'll exist in it's current form forever. It's not like vanilla where you only had 2 years to get these items. Sucks waiting but there is plenty of time.
---
Nice attention to detail, but there was one detail you missed: the icon for a snake or a cockroach is a snake or a cockroach, not a cage.
---
Shield spike it is then. Thanks guys, apreciate it :D
---
I use a 12-button MMO Mouse so I just use 1 through =, ALT+1 through = and SHIFT+1 through =. 36 key bindings without having to bind other keys.
---
Classic is definitely not alt-friendly, but it's a great MMORPG. The closest we have to an actual modern MMORPG is FFXIV. What I like about Classic is that I don't have to worry about my Benediction titanforging or doing 4 different difficulties of the same raid. For now, I am logging on to make gold for enchants and for raids so maybe three nights a week. 
---
There was once a time when WoW Devs encouraged players to take a break for other games during content drought. That unfortunately ended after WoTLK.
---
Spinal tap is a great movie! Who directs onslaught? :)
---
Gotta euthanase all those assholes.
---
There is hardware behind everything dude... it's not Goku is flying around on top of all this data.
---
After getting ganked mid mob kill or out numbered and spawn camped for an hour at a time in hillebrand foothills or STV, I dont mind returning the favor at all lol.
---
Once you get to Wetlands, you can swim along the coast behind Dun Morph and there is a spot where you can drown yourself in Dun Morph Zone, then spirit rez  in that zone.  Save you running through wetlands and loch modan.
---
Yea because horde doesn't always control the area. Anytime a side is controlling the area its only around 10 people doing it. The server isn't that unbalanced. Or maybe horde have BRD entrance covered so ally are gathering at MC entrance. You think y'all are going to let me through? Lets say you die going in BRD 9/10 times as ally. I die 7/10. That's comparable. You take notice to you dying because it's you but ignore all the horde dying around you. Your letting your own personal experience cloud your judgment on reality. You should just re-roll on a PVE server where your safe from harms way.
---
Nothing is comparable to BRD. ST is just a dungeon where they fucked up and 
---
didn't realize how long it would take.
---
BRD meanwhile is like they just made a 7th major city and then worked backwards to turn it into a big branching and winding dungeon reminiscent of the world of Dark Souls 1 except instead of turning out like a dungeon it turned into a massive instanced leveling zone.
---
Arms warrior question. I'm an arms warrior and having a hard time finding pre raid BiS sheets and raiding BiS sheets for the Arms warrior class. Anyone have any direction to one?
---
It's fun because we know they get as salty like you do. Crying on Reddit about it. It's even better when they bring their main and I kill and camp that too.
---
I occasionally gank.  I've been ganked.  It's funny to be honest to 1 shot someone. As a druid I can easily see people fighting mobs, wait for them to be done (I'm not satan after all), and once they sit down to eat/drink I get a guaranteed ravage crit.  ez pz.
---
Warriors aren‚Äôt ‚Äútrespassing‚Äù on their items. The fact is there‚Äôs very little good DPS gear out there right now for them. The shoulders in UBRS are stupidly great and there‚Äôs no plate version. It‚Äôs the same for the mail chestpiece. Now any warrior who says that those classes don‚Äôt deserve the gear is just being a greedy bum I will say. 
---
But back in our day we didn‚Äôt realize what gear was great. Warriors may have rocked valor, but locks used Dreadmist. Priests rocked Devout. Times change. The only tier 0 that is good now to my knowledge is Shadowcraft. 6 piece shadowcraft is pretty nuts.
---
Hell yeah. Gnomes are always so rude.
---
from what i can gather, raid and PVP will have different gear even if you are not switching specs. in raids you are most likly wearing cloth to get the best stats. 
---
for PVP staying alive is key so you would want to look into better armor (mail/plate) to help reduce incoming damage (including a shield). sure you can still dish out some damage but your main thing will be healing your teammates and staying alive yourself. 
---
overall the Pally is more about utility then just straight dmg. working with your team is the key and very powerful, but going solo will be lack luster....Eng may also help in some factors as well be even then its just more utility 
---
Shadow Priest can melt faces, but has to spec into it (making you not a good haler for raids), but can still heal if needed in non raids and most (not all) dungeons and PVP. Gear will vary (looking at +dmg vs +heal type gear) but overall should have similar gear needed for both PVE and PVP. down side (for pvp mostly) is cloth armor/being squishy.
---
They both have there pros/cons but judging from your post about being a "badass in pvp" it sounds like priest will be the better bet. Pally can be a very strong pvp healer but if you are looking into Damage itself priest is your best bet
---
I wish when you kill a flight master, all flights (except those already in the air) are grounded. 
---
Makes people plan other routes just like in real life.
---
My tier list:
---
Top: Undead, Troll, Night Elf (female), Tauren, Orc
---
Good: Human, Dwarf
---
Gnome: Gnome, Night Elf (male)
---
Statistically it's one of the easiest farms, you're just getting extremely unlucky. In 30 runs you'd expect to see it drop 10 times and even if you're rolling against 3 or more people you still should have been able to have get it multiple times over.
---
Compare that with HoJ for melees, which drops 5%
---
None of the pre-BiS are really easy farms, but of all them Reed is one of the easiest. Besides arena loot, what other pre-bis items are easier to farm? I can't think of any.
---
As someone with a full time job, other hobbies, and a girlfriend....I will be loot banned in my raiding guild on my main if my alt isn't at least lvl 40 by December 1st. Luckily it's well on its way.
---
Maybe you just don't manage your time well and you shouldn't use being an adult and an excuse.
---
You got to 161 defense?  So lucky!
---
Me neither. No BoE epic drop so far.
---
And I am 7-800 blue dragons in for my sinew , still no BoE epic .. sadface
---
hey is there any place where i can grind some fire elements at around lvl 43
---
I was leveling my fishing the other day outside stromgarde keep i was like level 41 at the time and a 60 undead priest came up and we had a nice fishing session.
---
Forget the name of the items but there was a lvl 55ish warrior tank I played with that had 3 or 4 tank epics for late game. The shield is the only thing I can recall right now. Skullflame shield. Want to say it goes for ~400g+ on my server. There were a couple other items he had that were in the 100-200g range as well. 
---
While it's possible he farmed that out I sort of doubt it. Up side is he was a great tank lol. Took low damage and held agro from lvl 60's just fine.
---
I don't think I have been to any of those zones so I have no idea! I just see contested and I imagine that both places have "equalish" presence there, but I am imagining I am wrong.
---
This is, unfortunately, your daily reminder to just roll need in untrusted groups.  It would be swell if you could trust everyone around you to not grab stuff they don't actually need.  And if you win it and someone else has a legit need for it, obviously you can work that out with them.  
---
One of those instances where I'm glad I run in a guild with a low population, but know nobody's rolling need on anything they aren't using for the weekly dungeons we run.  But as soon as there's a party, I'm rolling need on BOEs/Tradeables, because I'm not willing to exclude myself on a roll I'm entitled to.
---
Yeah, when did an Alliance leader become the central antagonist of an expansion? I guess Arthas is the closest, but hey, I never served under him.
---
I can't wait to see how much whine it will be when p2 hits and world bosses are released.
---
Where do you think Ice Cold Milk comes from?
---
Is Alanna‚Äôs embrace in game. I checked on wowhead and I thought it said patch 1.13. We are on 1.12 right? I was trying to figure it out last night and couldn‚Äôt find any references. The reason I‚Äôm asking is I hav t heard much hype about this item and thought it was rather good when I saw it on atlasloot. Thought it would be pre-raid bis.
---
See, other people have told me this .. but when I added it to my Addons folder and loaded the game, the game immediately gave error messages and auto-disabled it for being the wrong version.
---
Could you provide the link to the download you're using to see if it's different from the one I found, please?
---
You would make a little more on average disenchanting select bop blues than you would vendoring everything, but not so much more that will make enchanting a better money maker than some other profession. At least if you don't have high end or rare enchants. Also as a druid and especially a tank you could form a dme jump group pretty easily, and as long as someone in the group is enchanting you would still get the benefit of farming shards.
---
There's no deep reason. You were there and it required 0 effort on their part.
---
I don't wanna be a hinderance to my guild either! I'll reluctantly take leather gear if I'm gonna be doing terrible dps without it.
---
I said "GOOD DAY"!
---
Man, you must be *really good* at putting your fingers in your ears and shouting "LALALALALALALALALA" in people's faces.
---
They're phasing out snipping tool in favor of Win+Shift+S

Good point, it just sucks because I like a lot of the guildies I play with.

---
This works aswell.
---
One could only argue that night elf female is top tier, if the fact that they can masturbate to their character reduces the time spent tabbing out to watch porn, and therefore increases their playtime with minimal downtime. Otherwise I don't see anything else that makes it top tier other than " my character is hot".
---
Sent, thanks.
---
Yeah but the majority of the playerbase had absolutely no idea what they were doing. Now that we have 15 years of experience built up this stuff comes naturally, but when Vanilla was around most of us were just winging it.
---
If you're on Windows 10, Win+Shift+S will let you select an area for screenshot and automatically send it to your clipboard.
---
I don't engage in world pvp, but if you use provocative emotes on me, I'm adding you to my KoS list and I'll make your time playing a misery when I get the chance.
---
If you really want to 2H Arms in raids you can get the 2H Axe Nightfall. Casters will love you. https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19169/nightfall
---
2H fury is viable but far from optimal.
---
That's a raid spec not a great PvP spec you're missing alot of damage.
---
Oh? Interesting! I had no idea!
---
I still see a blocked message though. I have had this on since launch and in chat I still see the invite was blocked. It gets rid of the annoying popup. I report them every time.
---
What do you like about it them?
---
What‚Äôs the addon that shows who drops it?
---
A lot of the places you mentioned are in Kalimdor. Which is mainly horde controlled and you only went to horde controlled areas in Eastern Kingdoms.
---
Yeah, just learned this today. I figured it was like any other dungeon and BOP loot.
---
No they don't. Might and power do, but firewater doesn't stack with might.
---
So? I'm not going to not respond because you said "Good Day." LOL

Just learned this today. Thanks!

Kungen got banned on twitch for saying the F word. So I think also Blizz takes it seriously, its just as bad as racism.
---
But with no challenge what's the point? I loose interest in a game if it's not challenging.
---
Problem with gehennas is that its a huge majority of horde players on the server, while i dont have a problem in elitist pvpers i do not find it that fun to always by outnumbered 1-3
---
yes, not the case.  
---
Most zones are favoured to one side, at least earlier on.  
---
Once you get into your 50's is when you see more neutral zones, with no much presence from either side. Mostly neutral factions with some exceptions.
---
Ah yes if only there was some special rolling method that you could use when you don't need the item but want it for its monetary worth. That would make it so much easier.
---
Well if you keep getting aggro you might be using the wrong spells. Never shadow bolt, never immolate
---
I played VW until 60 as 30,21,0 and when you ony put your 3 dots up and then Wand you pull threat at 30% HP.

5 minutes before. Not 1 hour. Such bullshit post.

I mean... you're not wrong, but who are you trying to tell? It sounds like you are angry at the Lords of Stormwind for wronging VanCleef... and thats kinda hilarious dude

You should let him know that if you're on Windows 10, Win+Shift+S will let you select an area for screenshot and automatically send it to your clipboard.

It's disturbing that fury warriors are trying to justify ninjaing leather pieces from rogues or hunters.  SERIOUSLY, there is no gray area here.  YOU ARE SCREWING OVER OTHERS, ninja scum.

Skarm is big on the dual wield prot/fury tanking build. He has a video breakdown on YouTube. Puts out massive damage &amp; still effectively tanks, supposedly because the meta has shifted away from deep prot. The only downside is no stance dancing b/c no tactical mastery, but he explains why the rest of the build compensates for that in the vid.
---
Even if he is friends with an officer or GM if he gets gear from raids he should be in the guild. Just saw a situation similar to this go down in my guild so me and my buddys just left. In a much better guild now
---
That's the point that I want to discuss. We are at a point where addons are "must have" to raid. I just try to figure myself what the game and the raid experience would be if there was no addon? 
---
To me, playing without addon could be more interessting cause it forces the players to be more aware. To use the good old macro to alert other player of actions and interractions.
---
But Addon are here, I will not fight players that use them but to me again, addon kills the spirit of raiding. 
---
I would enjoy an hardmode with no helps where you gather alone the informations that provide the game with no other ressources than yourself. 
---
I prefer playing a game than a tutorial. That's my opinion.
---
What about killing greys? Isn‚Äôt that DK?
---
My favorite wow memory was in early TBC, i had just hit 70 on my mage and i saw someone looking for a mage for Karazhan, i didnt really know what karazhan was or what raiding was, i had only seen my friend do a few raids in vanilla, but i asked if i could join and told him i had no experiance, so told me they just needed a mage to make water and buff int, so he invited me and we cleared all of Karazhan that night, it turned out that the group i had joined was a bunch of people from the best guild on the server, so they didnt really need any gear, so i got 3 items that night, and i was so happy, it was very magical, karazhan will always be my favorite instance in the game
---
Doubt Blizzard check every name in native languages. However, if you report them they will have to change names.
---
Shy don‚Äôt you explain it?
---
It entirely depends on when hot is rolled
---
There's hundred on different ways.  
---
Reach level 60, do quests. When you 60, quests give exp*6 coins.  
---
That's easily 200-300 gold from WPL\EPL quests alone.
---
Play on AH - write prices of most popular items, monitor them through the week, buy then they low, sell when it's high.  
---
Tank for money. I was offered 10-20 gold to tank a dungeon :)
---
Or you could tank Stratholm for first Righteous Orb.  
---
Farm skins/herbs/ores. Or you could check price of disenchanting reagents, create level 1 alt with enchanting, farm low level dungeons for greens, DE and sell reagents.
---
You don't have to loot the mob. You only have to check what's inside. After that everyone can loot it, so skinners will loot it and then skin it.
---
We thought we did, and we still do. 
---
I hope all of you are enjoying the classic experience as much as I do, congratz everyone!
---
Even in vanilla everyone would need on high value BoEs. This was common sense.
---
Feel free to apply your logic as you see fit, but be prepared to get screwed over
---
the worst part about reddit  are the mods anyway , dictating what is good and what is not.. there is a upvote / downvote option for that imo 
---
If you want a forum not to post  stuff like "meme" of other stuff and only be about  theory crafting then it should be in the rules.. but this game is 15 years old its not like we get so much new information
---
It's hilarious that people saying that guy is crazy for freaking out are being down voted lol
---
Both sides do it, and it perpetuates an endless cycle of revenge. Got ganked and camped repeatedly in STV by the opposite faction? Guess what faction is about to get stomped on when you‚Äôre 60. There‚Äôs many ways to look at it, mostly negative, but there‚Äôs some positivity too. Some players are new. I remember when I was new in vanilla, getting one-shot by 60s in bad ass looking armor really inspired me to get to 60 myself. I went from taking months to getting to my 30s to weeks getting to 60 after experiencing vanilla STV. I‚Äôll never forget the trains of Horde streaming through STV to ZG and killing everything in their path, me included.
---
I'm on Alliance Atiesh, and I noticed it's significantly more crowded everywhere. I'm level 41 and questing has gotten much more difficult, even late at night off of peak hours.
---
I also tried farming some elemental fires for my mount money at 39 a few days ago, and there were always 3-4 other people camping the site.
---
I enjoy being on a high pop server though, so I can't really complain. I just wish it didn't slow down my leveling so much.
---
Hate to break it to you, but it sounds like you ran out of mana once.
---
I'll check it out thanks for the info :)
---
Wouldnt the pvp version of 0/30/21 spec be without improved hotw and rage/energy-gain on shifting instead, meaning the name is off ^^?
---
Anyway, obviously the t1 set is pretty insane for that mix spec.
---
In theory
---
Makes me thing... What classes would they be? Obviously the two fuckbrains are mages. Can't be any other way. And I'll bet you they haven't buffed themselves with arcane intellect either.
---
Ricky could be warlock - only he doesn't need water then. Life tap suits him though. Julian druid. He (thinks he) can do it all. Bubbles some kind of healer or righteous person, always fixing things (Priest/paladin?)
---
Jim could be warlock too for his drain abilities. Randy paladin tank; sometimes useful, but ultimately just running around screaming and can largely be ignored.
---
You can't compare a rank 13 helm to Lionheart Helm. It's almost impossible to explain the difference in achieving the two items.
---
Yeah, that was my thinking.  I'd have probably been fine-ish with it if he'd asked first.  Not asking and then saying "sorry I'm taking it for my wife" is just pretty lol.

Maybe they're doing herbalism circuits and you're taking their nodes. Maybe they're farming and you're taking their mobs. Maybe their buddy is similar level and you just killed him. Maybe it's just funny to one shot people then see them cry on internet forums about it.
---
Sub rules.
---
MC is so easy that to stand out as a guild you need good parses and clear times. When everyone and their mom can say 10/10 1/1, you need to say "clearing MC in 1hr" to be remotely enticing for decent players to want to join.
---
This is a sound point, but considering our FOMO and Impatient culture we have currently, stuff like this will continue to happen and it's sad to see because Classic should be a fun and friendly experience. But no, people have to be greedy jerks for content and gear when they should relay a positive experience.
---
While it's a nice story, like everyone else I want to know why you thought you deserved to keep it in guild in the first place? Even if it's a pug, every single person in the group is contributing time/effort for the chance to get gear. I just don't understand how a conversation like this would even be needed... you're basically in the same guild but under 2 names.
---
But that's just me. I think loot council/DKP/reserve systems are stupid, and just create arrogance among people who think "they contribute more". 
---
Roll for the gear if you need it.
---
One of the sub's rules is that if you're portraying someone in an unfavorable light you gotta blank their name.
---
Deathcoil is a horrify, so it works against fear immunity.
---
The replies to this thread tell you everything you need to know about the average skill level of tanks. Very low. Many don't even know how to maintain threat.
---
VW really only works early on and when he gets a new rank of torment. Until you get another rank on one of your dots, then it's shit again. And even after a new torment rank it usually loses aggro when mobs reach half hp if not sooner.
---
VW is just a walking shield in classic basically.
---
Somebody said that applied HS makes MH hit. 
---
Depends which one is true. It can be a huge boon and or watering it down.
---
Rank 10 is doable for ‚Äúmortal men‚Äù but the grind greatly increases for rank 11-14. That isn‚Äôt to say getting to rank 10 won‚Äôt require an insane amount of work and effort. I would save yourself the hassle and just get the Lionheart helmet.
---
He's probably the one with the character name
---
Back in the vanilla days it was a common phrase to say that alliance is for women, children, and " gay people who enjoy butt stuff".
---
That guy has no damn clue what hes talking about. 1% hit isn't worth 21 shadow power it's not even close at 13 to 14ish.
---
Would if I could, just sub rules to blank it if it's showing them in a negative light.
---
Inb4 banhammer?
---
I‚Äôve found the opposite. Probably like 80% of the people I know on retail rolled a classic character. About half of them have made it to level 50+, so they are definitely enjoying classic. 
---
There is one guy who had basically quit before classic came out who has officially removed himself from retail. 
---
Everyone else has been playing significantly more retail than classic recently. 
---
I play both, and I‚Äôm probably going to continue to play both. If anything, I hope that retail takes a more classic approach to progression. 
---
But yeah, almost everyone I know who plays classic also plays retail, and a good retail patch/expansion is all it would take for them to drop classic.
---
Lmao, ok. I like how you take this as kind of a dick comparison on who spends more time on a game and neglects their real life responsibilities more. Well good job buddy, thanks for sharing your amazing story. I‚Äôm gonna go get some drinks with friends tonight while you achieve those amazing life goal of yours or being a top notch WoW player
---
Sub rules
---
sure and druids ans rogues don‚Äôt so they actually need the gear more
---
I hate that I am going to quote something that Asmongold said but it‚Äôs actually true. Gankers are fun vampires. When a ganker kills you they gain a little bit of fun and you get angry or frustrated. The ganker also gets enjoyment out of knowing they made you angry.  Either you level high enough to become the vampire or you switch to a pve server. 
---
I have been ganked so many times at horde that Alliance are kos to me. Nothing else matters.  Knuckle draggers started this endless cycle of hate.
---
&gt; **it's only higher level players** or level 60 players that pray on **low/lower level** players

....
---
Are you expecting level 30 players to be trying to ‚Äúgank‚Äù level 60s in plaguelands or something?
---
hahhaa oh yes, the unknown farming zone of Ungoro Crater. Where absolutely no one is farming nodes, herbs and devilsaur atm.
---
lol, sorry to burst your bubble friend, but it does üòÇ 
---
Maybe not as often with that many players though.  
---
It doesn't really matter whether its 80v80 or 120v120, this fight is all the same every time anyway; people lag the fuck out and blow up each other in a matter of seconds. üòõ
---
Sounds like a sterotypical horde player, tbh.
---
I just hit 41 on my Druid and am curious how the leveling versatility compares to the life at 60. After hitting 40 I feel much stronger and able to tank/heal effectively with dire bear, innervate, etc.
---
I attempted Uldaman yesterday, first instance I've tried on my Druid so far. I started by joining a warrior and rogue duo to do the outer instance quests, then we went in for the inner quests and attempted to see how far we could get.
---
It felt pretty awesome being able to heal and power shift between DPSing and healing. 
---
Does this same versatility hold up for end game as a druid? I'm going HotW/NS spec and am hoping to tank 5/10 mans and OT/heal raids eventually. Just wondering if I'll continue to enjoy the end game as a druid if I'm enjoying it now at level 40-41.

It's a bit in between faggot and gay in Swedish. It's not as big a slur as faggot is, but it's definitely not as neutral as gay.

I choose Alliance because I wanted to play a Paladin

There is literally no difference between 13 and 14

get as much ‚Äúof the monkey‚Äù gear as you can. the +stam is obvious in that it just gives straight health but the +agi will help you dodge more

&gt;Dungeons are too slow on my server.

I don't know how you would know this if you aren't even 60 yet. You've played with a handful of people leveling and haven't played with anyone that is already 60.
---
Horrify doesnt count as a fear. Sucks the CD is kinda long but thats your best bet if its up. Curse of exhaustion and kiting is a very good option as well. Engineering trinkets are good if you have them like netomatic or bombs, especially since berserker rage only lasts 6sec.
---
Good points there

I want to fish winter squid. My fishing level is 0. How high of a level do I need before fishing the squid and where are some good spots to do so? I've heard that fishing is seasonal, could someone confirm this? Will winter squid be seasonal?
---
Additionally, I've heard that certain fish are better caught at certain times, is this also true? Is this specific for each location as well? As in winter spring can be caught at night at location A but caught during the day at location B?

That solves most of the problem since chat channel invitations will no longer pop up in the middle of your screen, however these invitations can still be seen in your chat window unless you turn off "system messages" in your chat window options, which is annoying because you need it to be enabled to see some important information like the one shown by the "/who" command.

Ret PVP is probably the most imbalanced 1v1's in the game simply because of the utility the class has and being able to reset fights like rogues, although not as much as rogues. You don't fear mages because they can barely kite you. Warriors are a joke unless they get you with Recklessness and your CDs are off CD. Rogue's can go 50/50 as a super skilled one will use CD's and abilities correctly, but if you're lucky with Procs you can 2-3 shot them.
---
But yes - AOE Grinding with Prot is your best bet.
---
I was asked if I wanted to heal DM north tribute, as it was the last spot they needed. I don‚Äôt like doing runs outside of guild as they can be a pain. Join, see a 57 mage, leave. It‚Äôs not even worth it giving it a try unless everyone is 60
---
Yeah, but on my server alliance just jerk each other off in Ironforge while the horde are camping BRM and all of the decent farming spots.
---
No well I didn't say that and I quit classic, nor did anybody of my friends announce it. Yet 80%have quit ;).
---
Not for retail or anything but still
---
I see what you‚Äòre saying, but in this case he was engaging 1v1 once every 5-10 minutes (it is the rogue way lok)... I think it would have worked in this situation.
---
So many parallels between TPB and classic
---
He has rage quit just because he died once early in a raid. Dude is the definition of a 'gkicked rager'.
---
There's a few spawn locations in 4 different zones, so you can run a circuit
---
It's because it happens after they start making relivent gear for boomkins and ret pallies.  Have to make booms start as ooms.  
---
(many of the .5 dungeon gear is practically best in slot through phase 6 for balance druids)
---
Vanas KOS.
---
Lets you add people to Nice lists, KOS lists, etc. It also notifies you when they group up with you or if they are in your vicinity
---
Leveling solo for a quest... oh hey there's a dwarf. Mob I'm killing drops a freezing band on death when dwarf joins. It was a pretty hectic few seconds lol. Good luck charm grouping.
---
try alt modifiers; with macros you can have at least 2 spells bound per key
---
Let his name and his Realm be known, people like that should not remain anonymous.
---
Yeah I think we get that but that doesn't ansewer the question : why do you feel pleasure when they react like that ?
---
What's the server discord for bloodfang?
---
We got a Deathbringer that went to the warrior GM who the day prior deleted his character, undeleted it, went on a how speel about how he was playing something new because he didn't want to be a fury warrior, was the worst performing fury warrior in our raid, and all around just a jackass. Pretty fun.
---
Is there a guide for Sunken Temple dragon runs? Looking to try my hand at a drakestone but clearing trash for an hour per attempt sounds inefficient
---
I recently discovered the addon VanasKOS in this sub. It has a nice/hatelist as well.
---
You understated just how truly awful this spell is lmao
---
What don't  you get? Some people gank. When I get ganked on my leveling alts I put the person on my kill on sight list. I make a note of their guild. Whenever I see ANY member of that guild, low level or otherwise, I camp them until they quit.
---
Every single guild who has ganked me has regretted it. Some of them in the form of 10+ walks to the BRD entrance, some of them in the form of their alts simply not being allowed to level.
---
Be careful who you gank out there.
---
I've never done it but I know someone who does. If they get killed by a same level they'll login on their level 60 and go on a killing spree. I think it's pathetic.
---
I just used a socketed armor with an amethyst in it üòÇ
---
From what I understand throughout my years of browsing the Reddits, is that most mods seemingly have some sort of weird God complex.
---
Same.  I like pvp, when I want to pvp.  But when I don't,  ain't nobody got time fo dat
---
Back in the days, I could count on Swedes online being friendly nice people. (1995 as such) But that changed once everyone got onto the internet with the beneficial tax deductions on "home computer" with dial up modems. Then everyone turned into the toxic sludge we so often see today.
---
Yeah I tried this but didn't have the gold to back it up yet so it kinda fizzled out after few days then took me 2 weeks to offload the rest I had at a price that would lose me the gold I put into it. Overall made like 100g. But it was slow money and for a week thought I was going to have to bite the bullet and take around a 100g loss. (Prices dropped by more than half and didn't look like it was going to come back. Kinda never did but isn't nearly as low as it was.)
---
If I had the funds to ride out that drawn out and deep under cut all would have been well. Price is still lower than I feel it should be. 
---
My success story of this was hardened addy in burning crusade. Was able to grab that market with 1k gold and hold onto it until I made 15k. (5k for my mount and 5k for a friends mount who loaned me 500g to get it up and running. Then an extra 2.5k for us both.) Really didn't take long at 50g a bar. Lol.
---
It's the jack of all trades basically. With some cool utility and crowd control.
---
Uhh what? No no no. Esfand has taught me that these items are ret prio. Warriors, get in line.
---
You can't just zero out the weight of a given stat on an item because you always have the alternative to change other pieces of gear to make that stat relevant.
---
Enchanting for the tanktrinket heart of the mountain.
---
Lmao you have to be 60 to even get the quest
---
Yeah, I can agree about deep sub, it‚Äôs always combined with other spec
---
alliance &gt; horde
---
This kind of thinking is bullsh#&amp;.  Warriors will upgrade that leather a week later.  Hunters/rogues are taking those pieces into MC, pre raid BiS.  You are screwing over others to benefit yourself.
---
Yeah but how do you get pleasure in this kind of reactions ?
---
Rules of thumb:
---
Either heals or tank is boss, period.....mostly what ive seen is tank
---
No one pulls but Tank unless asked by Tank
---
Dps...wait a couple secs on pull for Tank to build aggro.
---
Tank gets heals first, heals second, and dps third.
---
Dps...watch your dps, dont just cut loose and pull aggro off Tank, this is a team. 
---
Tank...watch mana on heals and dps. If someone needs mana call a halt and drink. If you are heals or dps and need mana speak up, esp Heals. 
---
DONT run off...never outrun heals. Dont split up. If someone dies wait for them. If they have trouble coming back thru go get them...TEAM.
---
Tank....use marking system and mark primary target, secondary etc and let people know the system. Dps...deeps on proper target. Unless needed otherwise of course deeps on Tanks selected target.
---
Crowd Control (CC)...several classes have ways to incapacitate a mob. is easier to kill 1 or 2 at a time and if theres a large group of mobs it may well be the key to life. Dont dps a CC'd mob. CC on cue, Tank calls. 
---
Hunter Pets....unless asked no growl. No itchy trigger finger. 
---
Overall its not about you its about the Team. Its about having fun. IF you have a couple people who want to just try and run through then ask the group. 
---
Manners....be cordial and honorable. If someone is acting out then kick them and replace. Many esp newer people dont want to speak up so if someone doesnt co operate vote on kicking them.
---
Ok, just a few rules that I remember from the first exp when I started.
---
I agree that this would be very helpful. The fact you can only have 25 people on your ignore list at a time is ridiculous.
---
Arathi - https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=2760/burning-exile (Level 38-39)
---
That's likely the closest level to you.  The next closest are in Searing Gorge but the spawns are quite spread out and the mobs are 46-49.  https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=5850/blazing-elemental
---
If you like your current class/spec just find a better guild anyone in your dead guild that gives you shit is not your friend.
---
I am not going to address something so ridicoulous and pedantic, but for just a sentence, I'll further your argument. Warlock/Palidan mounts are awful for PvP and if you're serious you'll get a regular mount.
---
More hit equals more white swings hitting. And thats like 50% of your damage.
---
That much spirit is pretty nice on a leveling item. My rogue would wear it.
---
Also depends on race, if the issue is hitting the boss then humans using swords or maces can do them a level early due to their increased weapon skills
---
YeH if you‚Äôre on a pussy ass PvE server. Lol
---
I think it looks fine and then their formatting is stripped when it's posted. I've noticed lists do that a lot? I don't use Reddit mobile much, though, so maybe it's a mobile thing. On my pc I just use bullet points.
---
You can report this btw - Just make sure that you keep the mail in your mailbox and a GM should be able to handle it.

Yar har fiddle dee dee

Being a pirate is alright to be

Do want you want cuz a pirate is free
---
You are a pirate!
---
I think you're looking at it backwards. Of course rolling need while knowing someone will roll greed is a dick move. No one is defending that. What the people who say you should roll need on BOEs are saying is that everyone SHOULD roll need because it is the only sure fire way to protect against ninjas.  
---
Just think about it. If the culture dictates you roll greed for items, this opens the door for people to act maliciously and roll need and ninja it.
---
If the culture dictates you roll need, then there is no way for someone to act maliciously and ninja it because all rolls are of equal value.
---
In a perfect world, rolling greed would be the best thing to do, but not everyone has the same standards for morality as you do. You only shoot yourself in the foot.
---
I also disagree that he doesn't deserve respect just because you disagree with his point of view, and comparing it to rape is ridiculous. Aggressiveness weakens your argument, it make it seem like you are arguing from emotion and not an actual stance. And as you seem to think  arguments are very important judging from your comments, you should realize this.
---
I would vote hunter or warlock due to the fact that theres 43 million mages running around. My alt is a 45 lock and they're pretty fun and shit stomping everything in pvp while leveling is a pretty fun change of pace
---
Exactly this. I grinded out a Treant's Bane for my 2H fury orc. Don't need to spend large amounts of DKP on a weapon anymore. Can use it for onslaught, ring, bow, gloves, etc...
---
Plus have you looked at treant's bane? its fucking sick nasty mate
---
Are you lost?
---
This sucks, but it's why I didn't roll a druid in Classic.  I mained a feral in Wrath and loved it, but in vanilla druids were always pressured to heal.  It's interesting that healers aren't really in short supply in Classic though, so maybe this will shake out differently than vanilla.
---
I'm not well enough informed on T0.5 to comment on that, but putting in world PvP objectives in Phase two is a BRILLIANT idea that I really hope Blizzard considers. It would make phase 2 absolutely INSANE and I love that idea.
---
Unfortunately Blizzard does have a solution, do nothing. They have made zero effort to do anything about faction balancing even though it's basically required to have some semblance of balance in this iteration of the game.
---
I don't spawn camp lowbies or stay in low level zones, that shit is a waste of time.
---
I will, however, kill anything red that I see while traveling, regardless of level. It's a PvP server. If you don't like it, log off, delete your character, select a PvE server, and start again. No judgement.
---
Looks? If you prefer wearing a turtleneck sweater to a leather jacket maybe, then yeah alliance is for you.
---
Setting yourself to 10 rage at will has ended up being a lot more useful to me than an extra 4 to all stats and ~100 armor would ever be. Even if no one else was bringing Improved MOTW, I wouldn't worry about speccing that way.
---
You can shift out and back in on the same GCD (Powershifting) for fights where you're rage-starved. Very handy for off-tanking or for slow-hitting bosses where you've dumped all your rage.
---
Furor + talented Enrage lets you open with Maul + Demo Roar on the same GCD to open up and let your DPS get going faster.
---
Furor also makes sure that you can turn on Feral Charge for PvP situations where you're healing yourself/rooting/whatever.
---
What about when you need to BRez or Innervate? Innervate mid-fight can save a lot of sketchy pulls in 5-mans, and shifting back to bear with 0 rage can feel pretty bad.
---
When you inevitably need to go DPS for a fight in raid, cats should be maximizing energy gain by Powershifting, for which you'll need Furor and a Wolfshead Helm to do it fully.
---
That‚Äôs what i use
---
Yo he said good day dude lmao
---
Report him
---
So the only dungeon people do between 52 and 55 is BRD?
---
I still get a message from blizzard that my blocked chat invite was successfully blocked... It still displays their full message of where to buy gold (phised). Lol
---
From what I understand throughout my years of browsing the Reddits, is that most mods seemingly have some sort of weird God complex. 
---
I posted this exact comment a few minutes ago and it was deleted. My theory stands true :0
---
I've seen multiple people say something like this, where the OT should stack on top of the MT for the fireball, but haven't had the chance to put it to practice (locked out). I'm gonna try and use this strat next week when our guild has another run at her. Overall, I think something is wrong with her threat distribution, because I've never seen old Ony runs have as much trouble in Vanilla as they are in Classic. 
---
Thanks for the tips &amp; vid though!
---
Purely opinion, based on appearance and animations.
---
Ah, that's cool. I was unaware.
---
I know what all the words in your sentence mean but I cannot connect them meaningfully.
---
Cool story bro, have a good night sleep. 
---
I‚Äôll have fun at the charity event I helped organising. 
---
God how pathetic.
---
If i ever rolled alliance, i would pick dwarf 100%
---
Preparation resets the cooldown, you have to be specced sub to do it
---
They really don't. I use 1 mcp charge on ragnaros and that's only because I'm wearing FR gear so my threat isn't good.
---
I'm almost positive that they don't, because it's applied to weapon speed, and not character attack speed.
---
Warlock with voidwalker. Warriors are not known for survivability during the leveling process, also make sure she is on a PvE server.
---
The binding is a rare item and should be given to someone who is going to stick around long enough to gather the rest of the items, complete the quest for the sword, and then use the sword to aid the guild. If, for instance, I let him roll on it, he gets the second one, and in phase 3 he gets the sword, and right after he gets it, he laughs at us, thanks us for helping him out, and goes on to form his own raiding guild or join another.
---
We would be out all of that effort for a sword that will never benefit us. That kind of demoralizing blow can destroy a guild. Now, does having him in our guild eliminate that potential? Of course not. But his refusal to join did raise some suspicions as to his motives.
---
That's the point of this story. Not that he wasn't deserving of the loot. He contributed just as much as I did. But I was suspicious of his motives. But one short conversation with him, where he demonstrated a level of humility and honor that I honestly don't encounter often these days. Most people are simply out for themselves, and if the world burns as a result, who cares?
---
But in that brief conversation, I found out all I needed about him, and my suspicions evaporated. And then yes, I was perfectly fine with him rolling on it.
---
Amazing!
---
Hunter, as you said,  might be the best chois. It could  get a bit difficult in dungeons. Figuring out the Range in which you need to be, dissmiss the Pet in some parts and so on. Feral druid could also be a good chios but I never played one so I dont know the gameplay
---
I'm on mankrik and i've seen maybe three, the latter 2 in the past couple of days.
---
Thanks Josh, this is awesome
---
Can you explain to me what hamstring does in a damage rotation. Sorry I‚Äôm a noob
---
Found this out the hard way as I was trying to stop someone else safespotting. I thought they had hotfixed it by patching the guard in but then he despawned and I was sad.
---
I am surprised they just don't add guards to these areas. Even though they keep banning people, people keep doing it.
---
Yea you don‚Äôt play retail for sure. Buffs are class specific again. Most classes don‚Äôt have pets. Mobility increases for sure but they are all so different and unique. Self healing was also needed a lot.
---
VMWare doesn't really do a great job of hardware acceleration. I doubt that WoW would be very responsive graphically.
---
Sheep.
---
I‚Äôm just trynna see the comments app
---
Paladin.
---
I'm an alliance player, so I usually don't get feared unless multiple Dwarf Priests are dead, so that isn't an issue.
---
Fight Club, the wow classic warrior discord. The values were determined by extensive testing with various levels of armor reduction until further armor reduction had no effect.
---
Is anyone interested in a daily general thread? I think it would be a nice place to share last night's stories without creating a whole new post for something small.  
---
Example: Last night's Maraudon run dropped 3 back to back blue boe's, spawned the rare spawn, and everyone was getting gear they wanted from the regular bosses. It was the ultimate run. No wipes, no deaths. We started around 9pm and were done by 10:30pm killing all bosses.  
---
Yes... this was also a thinly veiled attempt to share this story. But really, am I the only one that wants a daily / weekly general discussion thread?
---
yes, the tank loosed his aggro upon the boss
---
All your points 1-5 are just you straw maning legitimate things said about classic launch. The fact is the numbers have fallen off massively, this is evidenced by the pretty much non existent queue times on almost every server at this point. And for as much as this post looks cool I'm on a high pop server which never looks like this. Depending on the day there is typically not even half as many people as looks to be in this video.
---
&gt;And here we are today, with sad retail drones (still not understanding WHY Classic is dwarfing Retail, both in player numbers and player activity, months later after release), pushing their "Classic is dead" deadline to 3 months.
---
There's no evidence Classic has more players then retail. The best idea of this we could have is parse numbers on Warcraftlogs and Retail dwarfs the numbers of classic in people raiding but again that doesn't mean there's more people playing retail.
---
&gt;Classic will die in 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, etc. etc.) it didn't happened at all.
---
Classic lost and enormous amount of its players within 1 month of the launch, that's just clear to anyone who has been regularly attempting to login through the initial surge until now.
---
&gt;Basically, you and people like you, are salty
---
You seem to be the saltiest person in this thread. I don't know why Classic having or not having more players then retail is so important to you. I still play both games.
---
&gt;Instead of realizing and accepting that Classic is like 3-4 times more popular than Retail, today (it was like 6 times bigger at launch) 
---
Absolutely pulled that out your ass.
---
Why would you use the greed button if the need button guarantees that you'll get it? Why would he handicap himself?
---
Fuck, do you cry on 4chan how no women can stand you?
---
Ret pala is also very simple. You just auto atk and hope you get some procs
---
I suggest going and watching Skarm's videos. Pretty much has anything you may want to learn about when it comes to tanking/gearing/spec:
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/skarmtank](https://www.youtube.com/skarmtank)
---
Im not upset about the mechanic. 
---
I am frustrated by a bunch of scrubs that don't understand the value of taunt saying "Blessing of kings is basically a taunt now". Then a bunch more noobs on reddit run around saying paladins have a taunt. They don't. 
---
Shamn tanks also call Earthshock "basically a taunt". Its just wrong. 
---
Anyone who has actually tanked the content in this game wouldn't call a threat nuke a taunt. This is a bunch of wannabes pretending they know what they are talking about.
---
I think hunter and warlock has best leveling experience. Warriors have the worst. Paladin could be okey too, their unstoppable combo bubble &amp; hs has no counter in classic. Druid can be very fun, but mostly forced to be heal in endgame. Mage has much utility and can be very useful and fun too, but dies very fast and like 20-30% of leveling you just drinking and drinking again.
---
ooh tough guy, have you tried reading the post?
---
I'm switching to Alliance, so I can be with a good friend from back when I played a proper Blood Knight with a BFS in TBC-MoP.
---
I was originally thinking Hunter, but nope on Dwarf and Nelf waifus just seem off to me. Also, Hunters aren't doing well on logs, indicating a lack of need for many of them in raids, other than Tranq.
---
Mages, OTOH, are the highest ranged class on logs and can farm all day long, all day strong. They also have ports, which is useful since it'll let me port/portal to near the raid entrances and set my hearth near AQ.
---
Warriors have to use their thicc weapons to beat the crowds off of them. Everyone wants a tank. Farming, however, isn't their best thing.
---
Paladin has tempted me, but I know I'll get stuck in a damn sexy dress, doing the one job I hate the most, mindless healing.
---
As a rogue how do you remove poisons after applying? Often times I will have poisons on my weapons only to get gepuoed with a sham and I surely dont want to override Windfury. This is also assuming that if I use a poison, it is overriding Windfury.
---
From an ingame stand point it's fairly even, some zones favour one faction than the other but it's pretty balanced for the most part. All of those places you listed with the exception of TN and STV all have alliance bases, towns and camps that you must of missed.
---
From a lore stand point, the Alliance has/had tons, just after the events of WC3 most of them were either destroyed, taken over by the undead scourge, or recovered by the forsaken.
---
With power shifting you dont drop form. Furor effectively gives you a +10 rage button 2 or 3 times during a fight if necessary.
---
Not really, if you play one character there was always a time for other games, at least in second half of expansion. And how it ended in LK? Cata from the start was like: "oh you did your raids? Go play something else or try new class and updated quests because we don't have anything else to do".
---
I disagree. Using foul language doesn't diminish the validity of an argument. 
---
It's not so much about a point of view as it is about using the games mechanics as they were meant to be used. If there were no people like him, then we could all roll greed. That's my point. Nothing else, nothing more. Just like if there would be no criminals, we wouldn't need jail.
---
On a side note, analogies are perfectly valid and are in no way, shape or form akin to comparisons.
---
I think we can all agree that he is rolling need because he damn well know some people will roll greed. He's maximising his odds to receive something which he doesn't need by being shady. Now, instead of admiting to such a behavior, he decided to take a different route and justify himself in the most absurd and stupid way possible by claiming his actions wouldn't cause any problem if everyone acted like him. In my book, that's a green light to call him a cunt. 
---
As far as morality is concerned, his and mine doesn't differ; he simply has none.
---
The skill requirements, stance dancing,  and overall button mashing for Warrior make it a terrible choice. She'll also get spammed to tank every instance at ever possible second.
---
I think a Beast Master Hunter is probably the best choice. Send pet in to tank. Start auto attacking at range. Use as many/few skills in between auto shots as she wants. Heal pet.
---
Great class for farming materials used for crafting.
---
Well, good luck to ya man. I'd start to put out feelers. Call me a cynic, but if you already spoke with the leaders, and didn't get at least a little reassurance, than I doubt anything will change.
---
Horde side is also pretty solid but I do certainly agree about the farming
---
I use CharacterNotes for that! It is working with the Vanilla client!
---
MassivelyOP has an oddly major hate-on for Classic as well.
---
I think they've had 3 people "review" it but IIRC the first has consistently hated private servers, despised Nostalrius, said openly for MONTHS they thought Blizzard was selling out to whingers when they announced classic, and has openly mocked Classic as a stupid, shortsighted idea bound to fail.  Unsurprisingly, his review was "I like retail better".  /shock
---
Second review (not sure why, maybe the complaints were heavy) was more like "I never really played wow, I didn't like it much, so I'm going to compare the two" and again, unsurprisingly (since he (she?) said he DIDN"T LIKE IT MUCH ORIGINALLY) still didn't like it much, found retail more convenient and easier to learn.  I think played like 10 hours.
---
Third "review" was someone basically writing WoW fanfic from a POV of someone who was a paladin in retail 'cast back in time' to the world of vanilla, talking about how clumsy, slow, and frustrating it was (you're starting as a noob pally in Vanilla /surprise it's dull?) in 3 parts.  By the third part, they'd entirely abandoned the facade of a review, and it was just this long dull internal monologue.  ZZZZZ.  (recommendation, if you want a great wow classic drama read  here in reddit the heartwarming story of Krarg the Barbarian [https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/d1shsr/krarg\_the\_barbarian\_episode\_1\_getting\_his/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/d1shsr/krarg_the_barbarian_episode_1_getting_his/)  3 parts, 1000x better than MassivelyOP's fanfic/whinge/rant).
---
You might guess I got bitched at by mods for complaining about their 'reviews'.
---
I hear paladin is one button every 4-8 seconds, maybe that?
---
He doesn't. They could have needed if they really wanted the item, they chose not to when he did
---
Horrify works through berserker rage. Im pretty sure slows and snares also work through it.
---
I disagree with that. They need him much more than he needs them. He brings 3/4th of the raid team, while the other group brings 1/4th.
---
If he lost their group it would honestly be better long term because when he pugs people for like 1-2  weeks, those pugs would probably just join his guild if he asked them to.
---
Here's the thing.  Most people have specific goals they want to accomplish when they log on.  Maybe it's a quest, maybe they're farming, I dunno.  They also want to screw with the opposing faction.
---
The problem is, getting into a protracted PvP engage will likely distract from those aforementioned goals.  It's hard to farm Mountain Silversage when you're getting corpse camped because of a failed PvP attempt.  So people tend to avoid "fair fights" and instead will gank.  They get to harass the opposing faction without any risk of interference to their larger goals.
---
That's my theory anyway.
---
The other part of it is that people just enjoy screwing with people.  Honestly, people still bitching about this shit 15 years since it started if far more annoying to me than the people that gank.  DON'T ROLL ON A FUCKING PVP SERVER THEN.
---
&gt; Not saying Reddit in particular is any less hyperbolic, but in general any blizzard game forum is a disaster.
---
They really are, and to be honest I've always been somewhat amazed at the amount of stupidity expressed.  The most idiotic, trite, and brain-dead arguments get enthusiastic support while anything that requires even the most rudimentary level of critical thinking gets down-voted into oblivion.
---
And that's not even taking into account the mouth-slavering glee people got whenever they got to post the infamous Wall of No.
---
Yeah bringing 13 MCPs to raid is ridiculously. Especially since he's not dpsing every boss. Even if he was using 3 charges on every boss. 10 would be more than enough.
---
Recommended minimum level for a tank to full clear Uldaman? The level range is insane and I'd like to not have to kill grey mobs at the start.
---
It doesn't get much easier than a Hunter.
---
Sounds like paladin is right up their Alley. Mostly Autoattack and near invulnerability.
---
Aaaaaaand that my friends is why you plant your ass against the wall mid way up the steps.
---
oof
---
I can wait for 30 mins if it means I make a profit. I am better than most people as a tank. I leveled one of the hardest classes, pay the highest repair cost, have to learn the pathing and pulls of the dungeon, learn the mechanics of fights/mobs, keep threat by using all tools I have, and set the tempo for the dungeon and mark.
---
Not really, I've fucked more women than you cuckboy wannabe edgelord will have in your entire virgin life.
---
Stay mad son.
---
Dear god no they don't. There are so many damn priests in classic and having too many in a raid is a huge hindrance. We need more damage and utility, not an 8th priest.
---
Where are all the damn shamans??
---
Weapons will be the best direct upgrade
---
Report him and move on. He‚Äôll be banned.
---
Grinding mobs is faster xp than questing usually if you have a good class/spec for leveling.
---
If you knew how to read you would know that he asked is it viable. Let me define that for you as you seemed to miss the entire point of this thread in the first fucking place lmfao. 
---
https://www.collinsdictionary.com/amp/english/viable
---
There you go pal some learning for you to do today! 
---

Does anyone have a fishing macro where you click to cast your line and then click the same macro to have it loot the fish once you hear the sound go off?
---
Could be using a naga mouse like I do with a full thumb numpad
---
Seems like it would be less lucrative with more competition.
---
Most dungeons have at least one 'trick' or shortcut run to a particular boss, some dungeons like BRD have many. I'm guessing you messed up on the last ramp up to the top of Ring of Law? That's probably the tightest.
---
Just mention to your group that it's your first time, staying in stealth helps you get by a lot of mistakes.
---
I would also be interested in knowing what people think about this.
---
I didnt know you could get more than one shard from a DEd epic. That's sweet!

For zf farming it is nice to have more Mana.  Hp doesnt matter IMO once you get used to it.  Just swap a couple pieces for higher int gear

What‚Äôs this DM stealth runs 70g/h? Asking as a Druid

So vanish is the only way to do it?  Because I can blind sap, or gouge and wait to get out of combat.  Nothing drops combat except vanish correct?
---
How can there be more drama if they take it less seriously?
---
Actually I never really understood the phrase in general. I take WoW pretty seriously. So seriously, in fact, that I would no more lokely steal or be a douchebag in the game than I would in real life.

This guy ganked you and affected your mood and emotions so much that you decided to take to Reddit and create a post whining about it.  He's living in your head rent free now.
---
THAT'S why people do it.  Grats on being a sucker.
---
Exactly! You get it! When the Shoulders of Might dropped, I was up for it, but our 3rd tank had been talking about how much he loved the spikey shoulder look, and hated his valor shoulders. So I passed to him. Later, when the gauntlets dropped, he passed to me. 
---
I'm in the situation now where I am having dps warriors argue with me to roll on dps plate, because they looked up MY BiS lists, and know that some of their gear is BiS for me. Its kinda hilarious in a way, but its because we're all fostering an environment where we take care of each other and care more about others than about ourselves. And consequently, we all benefit.
---
And for the record, I veto'd their efforts. I have plenty of threat right now, dps warriors get the gear right now.
---
There was an event called the "Scourage Invasion" that added extra bosses to old dungeons with better loot.
---
As a mage not yet 60.. how does one make 100g/hr in DM?
---
Admittedly the whole pre-launch, launch, congestion thing was a colossal fuck up on Blizzard.
---
They had overwhelmingly good info (name reservations) how many people were going to play.  While I sympathize that they didn't know how fast the launch bubble would inflate/deflate, considering how little it costs to have extra servers and how easily they can smush them back together (no private housing like AA, for example, and condensing is far better than splitting, in terms of social connections), there's no real excuse for not having a hundred servers at the start.
---
Thats all i heard in comms last night, i don't get why people aren't on that shit like a goddamned coke fiend, its free loot.
---
It seems like that kind of thread would devolve into a series of blogposts where noone bothers to read any.
---
Victimblaming isn't cool, brother.
---
I just did my first MC raid yesterday my guild uses DKP. I'm going to save my DKP for weapons and bid the minimum on armor. For the reasons you explained.
---
Also I'm pretty sure within a few weeks most people will have epic armor and most people will be passing additional armor for cheap to people who don't need it.
---
For a lvl 60 mage with only 5k mana, ZF seems fairly hard as I have to be perfect in every way and then also die due to an add resisting frost nova, what are good alternative spots for me to AoE farm?  I do have skinning.
---
You‚Äôre a buffoon
---
Stv has a flight path for alliance on the road from duskwood I think
---
Yeah, a repeatable BL on your top 3 dps at the expense of one guy sure is shit.
---
It's not a go-to core build, but it's still pretty good
---
XN has run ST more than 1000 times trying to get the BIS offhand and is still doing it

Paladin 
---
Dps is mostly AA based
---
Heals for survival
---
Healing groups is mostly just clicking buffs and 1 heal 
---
Bubble hearth is the games biggest o shit combo
---
Rogues do put out top damage though. I also think you missed my part where I said they need gear -for it-  because without gear no ones doing any damage. 
---
Druids though suck even with gear so eh. 
---
&gt;try hard number nerd
---
so if you care about your performance and don‚Äôt just autoattack you‚Äôre a try hard number nerd? Come on man.
---
Incoming healing from other players might be broken atm since there's some drama going on around the plugin that communicates heals, but it should stabilize in the near future and main addons should all work with each other again.
---
I keep C for character screen and V (shift v, alt v) for pet commands.
---
Now what do you do? Lvl all of them to 60?
---
I don‚Äôt think this is true
---
They are 3-5g on my server. Not worth it.
---
Depends on the degree of tanking you're referring to. 5mans? Raids? Offtanking? Maintanking?
---
Same idea, you want MH to be slower w/ higher top-end damage, OH as fast as possible. Ideally both same weapon type with 5/5 of that weapon spec in combat, but realistically take the best combo you have and choose your spec based on best MH weapon available.
---
I have noticed you're a hate filled shitbag, so maybe you should work on me before you try and worry about my business. How tf you get negative karma. Shits too easy to get.
---
They are basically more durable warriors, that can heal rather than run away, or they can simply stun and run away.
---
They require you to really only hit your seal every 30 seconds, and if you want to get advanced you can seal, judge, re-seal.
---
It is the least mechanically challenging class to play for leveling. If they really need to run away they have a long stun, which is more than enough time for them to run from most mobs. Or bubble, again buys enough time to run from pretty much everything.
---
Realistically they could hit 2 buttons while leveling (activate seal and heal) and have no issues playing the game. It IS very slow paced and that tends to drive people away from it, but it may fit the desire here.
---
Here's a great thread on here about them.
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cl9udb/list\_of\_classic\_rogue\_macros/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cl9udb/list_of_classic_rogue_macros/) 
---
You made the right choice. Rogues can be a blast to play.
---
For leveling, I think Mage would be a good choice for sake of ease. I think that on a PvE server, she could get by just pressing 1 or 2 buttons (frostbolt, nova and maybe wand). Even in groups, it's as easy as frostbolting single target and blizzard to AoE.
---
Hunter seems like another good idea due to their ease in leveling, but when you get into group situations she'll need to understand pet mechanics in order to not piss everyone off.
---
Rogue might work as a meta Combat Swords build, as you really only need to hit one or two buttons (SS and Evis). But the survivability is low if you don't want to use all the other tricks in the book.
---
You cant counter immunity to fear ;)

Awesome, ty:

Damn thanks man! This was really helpful, wish me luck on the sabatons, were running MC today
---
It's always been a "bug" (see: feature) that she CAN use melee attacks during phase 2, but its quite uncommon. I would advise that anybody wearing cloth not stand directly underneath her. Everyone else could likely survive a hit, though there's always a chance at an unlucky crit.
---
Again, its not very common, it occurs when Onyxia is "deciding" what ability to use next, and a normal melee might slip out before she begins her next ability, or moves to another location. Oh, and if you can figure out how Onyxia decides what to do, you will be a hero.
---
Thank you! I will definitely need to sort out my key bindings when I‚Äôm next online!
---
How are you soloing? Can you make more soloing here over Maraudon princess runs? So tired of doing those for gold and I feel like I don't make nearly as much as they advertise!
---
My buddy and I were leveling together but I had to take a few weeks off. He started a priest in my absence and now he is a level 53. 
---
I have a rogue at level 40 and a warrior at level 30.  I‚Äôm pretty neutral on what class to play from a ‚Äúfun‚Äù perspective, but not sure which of the two classes would be best down the line. 
---
During the pre raid 5 man stage it will obviously be easier to tank/heal combo and gear up, but what about with raiding? We will probably find a guild that raids 2x a week or so, on the casual side. I really don‚Äôt want to off tank, kind of my only thing. Main tank I‚Äôd be interested in (and have done before) but wouldn‚Äôt love the extra responsibility. 
---
I might slightly be leaning towards rogue, but 100% priority is maximizing my time. Will my priest friend be enough to get me into 5s &amp; what about raiding? 
---
What do we think?
---
Notepad.
---
Probably the same reason this was being recorded :)
---
So so so many mages. It‚Äôs kind of unreal but I don‚Äôt want to put too much stock on what others are playing for my choice of what I want to main.

The pet thing has been annoying so far on my lock alt.

Paladin fully leather BiS for maxing auto attack dps! Pew pew!

The gold selling website earns $10 from that sale and $3 of it goes to the worker. Want a job?
---
mage or hunter
---
ignore the people saying paladins... theyre simple but they also suck and you will find many encounters you cant do
---
mage and hunter are both VERY strong and have a super easy time doing everything in the game with only a few buttons to press. Theyre very forgiving w/ escape tools too
---
Agreed. You can definitely find a raid spot as a fury warrior, but if you‚Äôre asking ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the biggest need‚Äù Warrior isn‚Äôt the answer. Resto shaman is probably the way to go there. That being said, I wouldn‚Äôt devote 10+ days played to a class you don‚Äôt want to play just because it‚Äôs in demand so it depends on the player.
---
Part of the problem with prunning is also that they added so many new ones. Why not update existing one, replacing it, or just leave it as it is.
---
Not really. There's too many mixed results which are accumulated from various patches phases.
---
This is the best place to ask.
---
Like old people addicted to gambling that sit at a slot machine all day. This is the same thing.
---
I like the traditional fantasy theme of the alliance. Really enjoy the storyline for the low level human zones. But I also like Tauren and undead from a cosmetic point of view. The only race I don‚Äôt like is troll and to a lesser extent orc (orcs don‚Äôt look as cool in WoW as Warcraft 3, they really shouldn‚Äôt have given them pupils).
---
I know I could have probably kept it in the bank and waited for a higher price, but I tend to be impatient
---
There are people in this world who cannot have a good time unless somebody else is having a bad time.
---
pirest paladina nd shaman are all horrible choices outside of maybe shadow priest
---
If you have to wear a shield, prot offers the best threat generation until high levels of crit which you won't get any time soon.

I just feel weird posting anything in this thread that isn't a specific question. Maybe I come across a tip I want to share or post something that is only semi-wow related. I agree, it feels minor overall and maybe not something that is warranted. But it just seems like this sub seems to lack that when other subs have something along those lines.

The lvl 45 pie food on my server has constantly had auctions listed for stupid prices, like 650g for a single pie.

They're absolutely laundering the gold, even if the AH takes a big cut out of it.

Oh my bad! In terms of the look, yea the gear def looks better on Orcs. I guess I just don‚Äôt really vibe with their casting animations (or melee for that matter, since I started an Orc rogue and went right to Undead shortly after lmao)
---
Yeah, we've got general chat in-game, why not here?
---
Arms BIS - Get 6-9% hit chance, then stack Strength and Crit. Strongest 2H you can find with a non crazy (read:0.5% epic) drop chance.
---
there is no way you would be able to do scholo or strath UD with group of level 56s. Maybe you can carry one if you have a couple of geared 60s but a full groupof 56s in a scholo run sounds like a wiping nightmare.
---
Yeh I mean post 11pm servers slow down the later it gets the more dead it gets. Expecting to find a tank that isn‚Äôt busy or wants to put will also grow exponentially harder the later at night it is. Then about 6-10am you‚Äôll see the daytime population begin logging in and they still have less people on them than during peak 5-11 at night.
---
If you think these mediocre, dimwitted assholes are thinking that far ahead you've got another think coming.
---
It's fun
---
There's a big that can occur where they won't aggro.at any range.  Happened on my loc when coming to ratchet from bb.  Was able to dot anyone, anywhere with no aggro penalty.  I chose not to stay camp and moved on to level- after a full sweep of the pier ofc xD
---
What about wasd? If you move with mouse isn't this useful?
---
Yeh I went to netherwind from thalnos it‚Äôs not dead at all it‚Äôs a solid vanilla experience no mega server population.

Or just gdkp

Oh, I misunderstood.  I thought they meant go to ZF and advertise for portals, not go to ZF and AoE farm, oops.
---
Not with that attitude!!! ü§£

lmao, I have 52 key binds on my shammy (and still GASP click some things)... I'm gonna suggest any other class before Shamans.

Skullflame is actually superior for paladins, because the proc scales with spellpower linearly on a 1 to 1 basis (1 spellpower boosts its damage dealt by 1).

The FRD is more of an aid to Warriors who have piss poor aoe threat past 3-4 targets.

It's exactly this reason that I have any amount of faith it's being worked on to be honest. They've seen classic can be a long term, low impact, viable source of income. If they can get it to a base of working "well enough" that people aren't quitting without putting in an insane amount of dev time, you can bet your ass they're going to do it. At the very least, keeping classic players subs going until retail xpack launch is a must to get as many people to say "hrm well fuck it I'm subbed anyway, may as well give the new xpack a shot. Welp I need some gold to start, lemme just buy a token..." etc

Ah ok, glad to hear it was a misconception, I'll certainly try to run some raids when I get to 60.  How long are MC and onyxia usually?

But if I block them I cant report them. The more reports an account gets, the quicker blizzard bans them and the sooner they need to make a new account. Each account is $15. Which cuts into the profit margin. Id rather be annoyed and cost them $15 plus time buying a new account. I am however incredibly spiteful, so that might be part of my decision.
---
Sick, I‚Äôm leveling a warlock and a hunter right now, alternating on rest xp between playing my main, I can tell hunter will be fun 1v1 because it‚Äôll be a lot more than just swing and destroy like my enh shaman.

necrosis hasn't the best rep. 'babys first addon' and blabla.

Tough question since the value of gold won't even remain constant. Of course there's a demand spike since everyone wants their Lionheart, but Titanic Legs will bring demand back up in the future as well as the T3 quests.
---
My advice: use it and get stuff that helps you now or sell. The stuff you want to hold onto is stuff that goes from 0 value up to something crazy due to a new raid tier. Stuff like Greater Shadow/Nature protection mats.

Pretty sure it's server end.

Boe are just gold in item form. In pug groups, all should need. It‚Äôs 100% fair. Everyone earned the gold, so everyone gets an equal shot.
---
Warlocks banish and curse in raid as well, hand out healthstones, apply soulstones.  It's 85% bolts, yeah, but there's a bit more to do there.  Typically raids are minmaxing so classses/specs have fairly dedicated roles and ideal spec and abilities.
---
Maybe they did.
---
I really do wonder what percentage of accounts with characters over level 5 also have a level 60 right now.
---
I know 2 of my BiS are Bloodmail, but other guides say different. I haven‚Äôt looked at the rest
---
Technically isn't it both?
---
Dude if you are farming gold just respec between the two specs. It‚Äôs not rocket appliances.
---
We are talking about BoEs, not BoPs. If I win a warrior BoE, sell it for 400G and use that gold to get a Hide of the Wild, I'll profit just as much as the warrior would have. If you need on a BoP mage blade and vendor it, you won't make nearly as much use of it as a caster would have. 
---
There is good raid loot for every class but there aren't good BoEs for every class, is it that hard to understand?

Death Coil is instant cast, no cast bar to prompt Rogue to Vanish it. He's got to react to it which means he's got to see the projectile and splitsecond think what it is. Sure a Rogue can vanish it if they're predicting it. But I am definitely off GCD as soon as he vanishes. Vanishing also puts my Succubus out of combat so I can invis her and charm. Either way I still Skull of Impending Doom to deal with Blind, Gouge, Sap etc. Switch to Skull as soon as you spot a Mage/Rogue.
---
It's not an easy matchup assuming the rogue is competent, but Warlock has a high enough skill ceiling to outplay a Rogue.

This is my thinking.  Some classes don‚Äôt have a ton to choose from in MC so why not wait for the rare item that makes the biggest impact?

A lot of those guides are out of date or just factually inaccurate.  I don't personally play an enhancement shaman so I can't comment first hand.

Yeah finding a guild is definitely your best option. PuGs mean you have no guarantee of ever getting an item. If you‚Äôre in a guild and someone else gets loot, at least you have 1 less person to compete with next time it drops. Or if your guild uses some sort of DKP then you have some assurance you‚Äôll get items eventually.
---
PuGs work fine in retail, but it‚Äôs a lot tougher to gear up this way in Classic.
---
As a warlock herbalist, I dream of larger bags.
---
Gear is scarce in Vanilla/Classic. If you are planning to only PUG then this is something you will suffer from. You get "geared" one of 2 ways in Classic: 1. Be extremely lucky on rolls 2. Raid with a full regular guild group
---
If you're going to PUG then it's all RNG, if you run with a set raid group eventually everyone will get geared (takes a long time though)
---
And they're also the objective of a neutral quest so they get killed quite a lot.
---
Put them on ignore then make a notepad named people I want to kill with there offenses so if you wonder why they are on ignore you know why and when you did it.
---
Upgrades trump gold. It‚Äôs always been that way. 
---
I need to correct my misunderstanding of how loot rolls have worked in every group I‚Äôve ever been in till BFA?... cool story bro.  You go on being a loot whore bud. Why have 3 roll options then? Why is there not just roll or pass? Oh that‚Äôs right, so you can need items you are going to use and greed items you are going to sell/trade/send to alts. 
---
It‚Äôs fine if you want to play the way you do. You probably make pugs with items on reserve too.  Hope you at least warn people you are needing on BOEs because you think your gold is more important than an item they will use for multiple levels or months or years. 
---
Just admit you only care about yourself and let‚Äôs all move on.
---
I think it's generally understood that fire is best dps but frost offers more versatility and survivability. I might consider it since it would offer a different experience and is probably just as viable but I think frost makes more sense for leveling.

Completely agree with this.

Ok this is awesome. So Should I max out Arms then focus on Fury, or mix then in a particular way while leveling?
---
Absolutely.  You‚Äôre not hurting anyone holding onto your points, buy what you want with them.
---
Yeah I thought so, I don‚Äôt agree with some of that gear on the list. But I‚Äôve been sticking close to it since I haven‚Äôt played shaman before, as I‚Äôm getting into raids and picking up better gear I just compare the main stats, which seems to be crit and att power with agility stam and int
---
You've done good. I'm glad the karma came around for ya, but it's great to see cooperation and reasonableness. Here's hoping the other MT gets his someday soon as well!
---
I‚Äôm horde and i got ganked all the time in stv too. 
---
It‚Äôs just the game. Suck it up.
---
Pro tip: on RP server, don't go to goldshire
---
Well it WAS human...
---
I only know of my one, 1-hour buff that I got recently from ST that codex prayer of fortitude. I have fade readily becuase I levelled up mostly with no point to lessen threat and priest are such threat magnets. 
---
 I have no idea when to use prayer of healing in a raid. But in dungeons I use it when a aoe gets the whole party to 50%    my understanding though is the healers get thrown into a group and prayer of healing only heals those in the same group
---
 This is the first time I ever heard the term chain drinking. Care to elaborate?
---
I am sometimes allowed to apply one curse Clicking curse of elements and then casting shadowbolt isn't very engaging. Some fights I do need to banish but not usually. I was just wondering if other classes had a more engaging raid experience.
---
I made an orc warrior alt but damn do I love the look of undead warriors when they join my groups.  Too late now!
---
So you're saying that I see both buffs in my bar and they don't both have an effect?
---
thanks for all the replys i will probely go try the ones in searing gourge in a lvl or 2
---
Mage is easy mode in groups, can get by just spamming frostbolt and nothing else, occasional sheep if group is under leveled. Single target build would also be pretty easy for solo play, again just frostbolt at Max range and single pulls probably die before they get to you, and if she gets adds a quick frost Nova and run away is an easy escape.
---
Because it's fun and because I can. 
---
I never pass on an opportunity to gank a hordie who's entered combat with a mob, stunning, slowing and weakening them to the point where the mob kills them for durability dmg.
---
It's a fun cat and mouse game where I can't go too hard or they don't get durability dmg, but I can't go too soft or  they'll leash the mob and then I have to kill them myself.
---
Ex: Moon Guard had a functioning city government for Stormwind. A council of nobles, a court system, a well developed church and clergy to run it, and more.

It‚Äôs honestly super interesting to see.

Whoops, good catch.

That's a Shazzrah fight I'd like to watch
---
From my own rather bigoted view:  In the modern era of low tank count and warriors asking to DPS, I‚Äôd judge a non-tanking (dungeon) warrior severely.  I definitely omit warriors in my group due to loot competition and the principle that they should predominantly be tanking their own groups.
---
That being said, I believe Pally healing + leveling as either Ret or Prot could be a huge blast.  I‚Äôve not played alliance since I started in 2007, but outside-looking-in, Paladins are definitely not a turn off.
---
Additionally, Rogue could be a fun counter to the Lock play style.  You do melee, stealth, and burst rather than dots, pets, and ranged casting.  Could be different enough!
---
You could try making the folders Read-Only.
---
This comment is god tier.
---
They implemented a solution, in Vanilka, they‚Äôre called PvE servers.
---
PvP servers are super fun for people like myself who enjoy the immersion and challenge of engaging in Warfare in a World against another faction.
---
They used to be 500g. Honestly though I've only ever seen 1 on the market at any time usually ranging between 420g69s69c I'm assuming for the memes and 750g. I don't actually know if any of them ever sell though.
---
I fully agree
---
Just have patience -- the one who hoards longest wins. Ultimately you'll be able to get the rare item, then circle back and pick up everything you skipped so far for cheap because others already got it.
---
With months until the next content release hoarding is the only way to go in a point-based system.
---
There's actually very little in terms of gear upgrades for Warriors in Ony+MC beyond weapons. Quick Strike, Wristguards, Onslaught Girdle, and Ony neck. Everything else you could pick up would just be if you wanted to offtank. Everything good for warriors is rare except for the Ony neck, which you're guaranteed to get (and most guilds reserve for fury warriors because there's so little loot available for them).
---
&gt; **Pugged**  
---
Yeah, probably right.
---
Unholy Sartharion tanking and blood dps is what i think of when i think DK
---
Is there anything you could suggest to make leveling a mage not mind numbingly boring? I'm currently leveling my warrior and just reached level 51. I have a little side character, a mage at level 18, that I'm leveling when I get a little bored of playing warrior. PvP is one of my biggest focuses and I'd really like to have two completely different characters. Leveling a warrior has been a pain but at least I feel like I got new abilities that get added to the rotation. With mage it's either spam frostbolt or blizzard and it doesn't really seem to ever change from that.
---
I'd just let it sit there for it to timeout. Send me this crap and you'll have to wait the 30 days to get it back.
---
Character Notes is the best. Keeps a log of comments and even shows the note on player character in world and in chat.
---
Necro set is what you want, from schholo.
---
All else is pretty shit
---
The heal rotation is super simple. You literally just use different ranks of flash and holy. 
---
As far as leveling solo yes if you seal twist and min/max you can kill mobs faster but you can kill any non elite with just keeping a seal up and auto attacking.  Doesn‚Äôt get more simple than that.
---
There probably won't be a ton of camping for honor. The diminishing returns on honor for killing the same player are severe. Waiting around for someone to come back from the graveyard would be a waste of time.
---
It's far more likely that people will just form groups of ~5 players and roam around high-level areas looking for kills. And probably some pvp at key areas like dungeon entrances (BRM comes to mind).
---
I doubt they'll be many city raids. The DHK system pretty much prevents anyone from grouping up for city raids because one person in your 40-person raid pulling a civilian now kills everyone's honor instantly. Maybe people will "group up" but not be in groups at all.
---
Use Itemrack add-on to change from heal set to DPS set.
---
Choose the slowest 2H weapon possible with the biggest max damage number.  Don't turn down melee gear if the warrior doesn't want it.
---
Wear some spell damage gear. Make sure you are not passing up spell damage gear if the locks and mages don't need it.
---
Wear some strength plate gear. Don't turn down gear if mainspec greeds. 
---
Keep Seal of righteousness up but judge it every opportunity you can
---
If you have Holy shock, divine favor and Holy Shock to get the crit.
---
Get a mage buddy to make you some water.
---
This is the easiest and fastest solution. Thank you!
---
Holy shit, are you me?

New player here, I know this question is asked a lot, but does anyone know which PvP servers are the least Horde dominated (NA)? I have an alli warrior but want to reroll Horde, just don‚Äôt want to be on a 70%+  horde server where PvP is just group gankbangs. Alliance char is on Rattlegore right now which feels pretty even, maybe 60/40 horde but good enough s
---
Any advice is appreciated!
---
Dude there are SO MANY drops you can get from brd. You can start getting pre raid gear now. Dont worry as much about xp now as killing the right bosses.  Do you understand your itemization and what items you want and why? Do you intend to raid or pvp?
---
This is why I rerolled to a druid
---
You can solo plugger at 54+. He will drop cables, Barmans, and mixologists tunic. In 7 kills I got two cables, two barmans, 1 tunic, and two random greens. YouTube it for the fight info. Takes a couple attempts to get it down. Also download classic cast bar addon to make it real easy. 
---
Angerforge runs to get the HOJ trinket which can be done at low 50s. Issue is finding a group that will take you. Plenty of videos where two rogues solo him. Once again YouTube it.
---
Aside from HOJ you don‚Äôt really NEED anything in BRD. Princess and emp runs for boots and neck are really all else there is.
---
Playing warlock effectively is really nice. It's hard to be a good support class man, it whats make them fun!
---
Your typical lowbie ganker isn't acting out some long term strategic plan, they just do it because it makes them feel powerful.
---
I disagree with this. Running deathfordge retaliator can pull great doe and doesn‚Äôt cost 600g.
---
I don't know every classes rotation, but if you want to press more than 1 button, play a Fury Warrior and carry around a tank set so you can OT. 
---
The DPS rotation isn't super complex but it's definitely more than 1 button (Bloodthirst &gt; WW &gt; Heroic Strike/Cleave/Hamstring). Then, depending on the fight and your guild, you can OT which is an entirely different set of abilities to use, and you can also tank dungeons if you wanted.
---
I think it's a blast! The hardest thing about it is managing your threat on bosses, it's so tempting to see a full rage bar and go ham, but it's probably gonna get you killed, especially on Rag/Ony.
---
What you saw was likely an anomaly. I expect it to go up much higher in phase 2/3, but right now on most servers it‚Äôs going for 15-30g, which is honestly high for lower level twink items at the moment - which is crazy.  
---
Unless you know for sure you can get 250 I would wait until phase 2/3, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing with all my gear. I got my 40 mount and no other but financial urgencies so why not?
---
Best game in the world when a group a players in greens that are not even max level can beat the toughest content?

Nah fuck that. If people gonna act like dicks, leave.

What do you need gold for besides your epic mount?

May as well get to 60, then worry about gold. You're putting the cart before the horse here.

By that logic you should need on everything because you can sell BOPs to a vender.

---
My interpretation of the value of the commentary from most of the popular streamers.
---
Horde is for chill people looking to have fun pal up for dungeons/raids/quests. They pick their characters because they think they look cool or like the fantasy aspects of the game.
---
Alliance are usually West Coasters playing on East Coast servers. Filled with try hards and people that genuinely get enjoyment out of being smug and trying to piss off "mud hut" horde. Either pick their characters as a human because they're boring humans irl, as NE to look as douchy as they are, or gnomes to be annoying (dwarves you alright). Then of course the insane amount of female characters because of either straight gender dysphoria or a weird need to want to fuck their own characters.

We are one shotting every boss in MC and our top DPS is a lock (not me). The damage is cool but I want to be engaged and this isn't doing it for me.

Thank you :) Gotta show that I'm not the terminator haha

I'm on Rattle and it feels somewhat even.

You are a shaman, the second most played class on horde. Everyone saw this coming, and now we are starting to realize how impossible it will be getting spell damage rings and trinkets for the ele off spec every single shaman wants.

Axe of the Deep Woods is 180g on my server. I literally just saw 4 on the AH. Compare this to the fact that I have 51 rend kills and no dal'rends mainhand (it dropped once and a fresh 60 rogue in greens outrolled me during his first UBRS run to do the dragon eyes quest). I'll happily pay 180g to get something as good or better than 2x dal'rends.
---
Benediction seems really good. Last time I checked it was near 50/50
---
PVP is about stacking two stats since Resilliance doesn't exist: Intellect for Mana pool, and Stamina. After that it's mostly trinkets and the biggest weapon you can find + grenades.
---
huh this must be on another layer
---
Why did I already know you were maining a Warrior...
---
You should treat the roll for the key as the roll for the cache. If you win the key, you win everything in the cache.
---
At least you're honest üòá.
---
The buffs can also stack, so windfury stats+haste seems like a few godly seconds. And image the aoe stun on majordomo lol
---
60 mage here I tend to solo most of DM north for gold ;)

I can do east too.

There are a few addons that will let you move or modify all UI elements.

Yup, hamstring spam on horde is another 2h fury build that can work. Alliance only have the 2h slam build
---
You can never, ever get a DK for killing a human player. Ever. It's ONLY for NPCs tagged as "Civilian" (typically low-level quest givers).
---
It's probably warrior in my opinion.  Big damage with a not so cut-and-dry rotation like a mage or a warlock.  Hunter is also fun but just be prepared to be fighting for your raid spot come AQ40.  They are great damage dealers in MC and BWL though. 
---
If you like healing though, that's where it's at.  I do not.  But, healing will never be the same from fight to fight.  You have to stay on your toes and learn to anticipate damage spikes and even though the dps will still get themselves killed. 
---
I enjoy dungeon healing but raid healing is not for me.  I get tired of primarily focusing on the health bars the entire raid.  It's more fun to just spam frostbolt and watch it fly at the dragon.

Viskag/brut or perds/cht are *far far far* bigger upgrades than any piece of t1 or t2 there is. That said, if you're not at the top already on DKP, you're going to be waiting forever for upgrades if you're only trying to get weapons.

They won't enable this for the same reason they won't put guards at neutral city flight points.

If you can figure out how to push AOE grinding, that was an enjoyable aspect to leveling a mage to me. Figuring out how many mobs you can push and how much exp/hr you can get is pretty fun imo.

Are people doing this for real? Once and awhile I put out a fake one for laughs in like Trade or something. Damn I guess all of classic is back lol

Why do you want to raid as Arms?
---
if your dagger combat spec, you should use a dagger since its not that much lower in dps
---
Stay motivated?

Fuck once I hit 50 I was on 24/7

I had sooo much motivation considering now the levels were in the single digits

5 MCs and 4 ONY‚Äôs here all with same guild and only 2 pieces of loot to show for it and that‚Äôs cause nobody wanted them (OEB + might bracers). It do be like that sometimes

My next characters name has to be SweetBrown for sure now
---
Agreed. Warrior (and good feral) tanks are in high demand for dungeoning, but very much not in demand for raiding. 
---
60 warrior tank might be a decent alt to sell dungeon running services, but if you want to raid/main it may be a very bad choice.  You can always respec at 60 to raid as fury, though.

Madseasonshow is like xanax for my soul. He's the best.

I did read them in their entirety. Discretion is the better part of valor.

Depends where I‚Äôm located, but I find I get them several times an hour inside instances. Very annoying

Fury is sustained dps, arms is Rng burst dps, arms is not designed for pve dps.
---
I am leveling a warrior and a druid to try something new. I never played those classes in Vanilla. I am interested in DPS warriors. They tend to top the DPS charts, but I don't know much about them endgame.

Hunter...? Just auto-shot and let the pet do all the work.
---
This probably worked better a few weeks ago right before DM came out but i was making around 40g/hr farming ghost mushrooms in maraudon. super chill and no chance of death if you have a brain

The only wiggle room is toughness vs. Iron Will, Toughness wins out imo.

Because it produces better results

Yes most of the EU eng servers are still layered and have ques because everyone quit. For sure my man. I guess that 4k que on Gehennas last Sunday was full of people waiting to log in for the last time lmao.
---
I was not too impressed by their rShaman guide, I found wowhead or Egregious a better source in my case. I'd check out Skarm tank on YouTube or maybe consult wowhead for a different opinion. Skarm is very informative and good for a YouTube guide, this is coming from a guy who prefers to read all his guides. That said, prot is by far better survivability whereas fury (or fury/prot) offers more threat and more solo capacity, but with less survivability. This is just based on the people I've healed and talked to, though - pinch of salt.
---
I'd like a PM of his twitch as well!
---
Wanting to get better is a "retail-mentality"? Sure, some people are stupid and don't understand the point of logging and just want to dick swing, but it's really good to figure out not only what you're doing wrong as an individual, but where your raid is going wrong and can improve to make things smoother. Don't use the fact that some people are idiots and talked shit to you as a reason for disabling an incredibly useful tool.
---
Because clouds are a bunch of connected servers
---
Fury scales much better. A fury warrior can get the 20% crit damage talent in arms, and beyond that there's not really anything more significant. Death wish and flurry are huge, and your rage generation will be higher, meaning you can keep doing more damage.
---
2 months is nothing... this doesn't prove anything.

If your going tank, u shouldn‚Äôt worry about Dps. The best tank won‚Äôt care about dps. If u wanna be an off-tank then sure you can do your thing but I would prefer a pure tank. Sometimes I have to tank ( I‚Äôm a dps fury war) and when I try tanking I‚Äôm sloppy and can‚Äôt hold aggro as good.

Classic is actually pretty alt friendly. Retail is not.

Results are better regardless of any individual good looking talent
---
Except that you are expected to be able to dispel, heal, CC, and use blessings appropriately. Paladin is easy on paper, but it gets pretty complex as you level. There are a ton of situational abilities. And solo leveling a pally sucks, its much like a warrior in that it struggles to survive against more than one mob.
---
Id use the dagger, assuming you have the 5 crit with daggers talent, because im pretty sure the extra crit offsets the small dps difference, and because theres no way the dagger has worse stats than dalrends oh.
---
Shouldn't have rolled mage
---
I believe both stuns would trigger at the same time, kind of like how you can Sap and Cheapshot at the same time to build combo points.  
---
The mace stun is not supposed to share DR with Cheapshot or Kidney Shot, having both would trigger each DR separately.  
---
This is a spec I'm wanting to play around with when BGs come:

Toughness is better than anticipation? Not doubting, just curious since I don't know the math or reasoning behind these choices.

I was leaning towards 3 points in Iron Will but I'm still undecided. Next level up I have to make that choice.

[Dominos](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/dominos/files/2793922), you can turn off the other features. [XLoot](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/xloot) also lets you move the roll window, but changes the way it looks as well.

Hard to tell, man. Some people just have generous friends. Maybe he took double gathering and has been hustling his ass off while getting loans from his guild? Sometimes guilds just stack on one person like that. My buddy plays warrior and I know the gold struggles but he still finds ways to make money through gathering and playing the AH. I personally funded his epics and he's paid me back in full every single loan - imagine many people doing this.
---
In OP‚Äôs case, no, he‚Äôs not being carried.  There‚Äôs like what, one or two items he might be able to use points on.  It‚Äôs not a life or death situation if he holds off on one piece of gear to chase down another.  And that‚Äôs the point of stockpiling points, so you get the item you want when it drops, that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs worked for 15 years.

It's the PvP player mentality.

Instead of stressing about why you're the MC target, tell your dispellers to stop sucking and dispel it, and that your raid should be CC'ing you, not killing you.

Then you should read some of these comments. I have 2 level 60's now and have spent 99% of the time running dungeons and in my experience THE BEST tanks are the ones who have the highest dps.
---
I was doing a 5 man run, and about half-way through the run, I stated what to roll in case a BOE blue/epic were to drop, and one drops pretty much that same trash pull. Sadly it wasn't very good of a drop.
---
It's amazing how a shaman who is missing 30 healing talents with a 30/0/21 build is struggling to figure out how to heal better.
---
Even with a full resto build they are weak compared to priests, so yes, they really need full resto.
---
You made the mistake of not rolling druid.
---
Ran 2 (not complete runs). Got one piece each run (since only one piece dropped per run).
---
That's fair, I honestly just want to relax and play the game drama-free, just didn't expect something like this to come up so soon.

Stop moving goalposts.

EU-Gehennas is not the only realm in classic wow. It used to be that basically every realm had a much higher queue, plus the realm pop cap was probably higher (they said they were bumping it up specifically because they were adding layers, which are now mostly gone). Now it's not.

I'm just gonna downvote you on the principle that you're using ElvUI but disabled the actionbars back to original. Shame on you.

Eh, good druid is going to melee you in caster until you slow again, then shift and wait for slow. Not power shift to clear one slow.

When do pristine black diamonds increase in value? When does the market fall off for them? On our server they are still going for 15g each

---
Why would you spend any money on consumables? I killed Rag and Ony countless times without using any more consumable than mp5 fish. Then again, I'm a healer, so when I take damage, I can simply heal myself.
---
As others have said, find a decent DKP-based guild, or at the very least, only join "MS&gt;OS +1" raid groups.
---
(ie.: Raids where members are expected to only roll for the spec they're playing at the moment and who limit the number of pieces people can win to 1.)

People act like because apes can do MC in greens that means that the raid is a joke for everybody. It‚Äôs the same idiots who say ‚Äúlol mythic raiding is easily in retail‚Äù because method cleared it in less than a week

1 perd 1 corehound tooth, 4 brut blades, 1 vis'kag, 1 mage blade, 1 trinket. 4 runs
---
Those are only the tanks that are levels above the average of the group
---
The biggest reason is honestly Flurry.  
---
Aside from that there is also unbridled wrath and the HS/Cancel "mechanic."
---
The horde is just better QoL throughout the game. Until end game.
---
More quests, more FP to better locations. Very easy to get around. Even the cities are more straightforward. They're all circles. With stuff in the middle. 
---
Storm wind is a fucking clusterfuck. It's so annoying getting anywhere. And I hate the tram system. Zepplins are so much better.
---
That being said Ironforge is great and so is its location to all end game content. Alliance also have better storytelling in their quests but most of us dont read them anyways.
---
Alliance starting zones all feel more "wow" to me than durotar or silver pine. Though mulgore still has that feeling for me.
---
Idk. I enjoy horde more. Less wondering around at low levels wondering what to do. I enjoy that from time to time, and have an alliance toon. But I always feel weird if I play too long on the alliance.
---
Grouping with gnomes just....feels wrong.
---
Block guild invites too
---
Weapon choice: Get the one you can get weapon skill with
---
Speed: You have to balance the speed. The slower your weapon is, the more value you get from heroic strike, but the slower it is, the less heroic strikes you can spam. The optimal speed is where you can just barely dump your rage with heroic strike. But there's so many other factors like well the DPS that it's not a big deal. Just make sure you have a 2.smth speed weapon for most stuff and a 1.3 dagger for vael.
---
Witches massive y'all!
---
Why did WoW classic spike in people not knowing how to screenshot/screencrop? :S
---
So dead...  
---
Obviously those are all Russian bots.  :)
---
Weird. I Swear 10 man Strat was a thing when I played back in the day.
---
I still have huge queues on my server... 3000 on weekdays and 4-6k on weekends.
---
Should be watching your threat.
---
Yeah you can't complete non raid quests in a raid.
---
I don't really get it. If it's spell batching then the tank should survive since they're essentially receiving the heal at the same time as fatal damage. As long as the heal is for more HP than the damage, the tank shouldn't die.
---
So I don't know why healing feels so laggy but it's really frustrating.
---
Think that depends on the server, no?
---
Just re-rolled on Bigglesworth (Ally) and the first couple of zones I've gone through are still pretty populated. Plenty of competition for spawns, groups for named mobs, etc. 
---
Seems fine to me. Not overcrowded to the point of not being able to progress, but still active enough to find partners when you need/want them.
---
Nah, it‚Äôs them fuckin‚Äô nobles, the stonemasons are the ones that got screwed.
---
So train it. It's like any other skill, the next rank improves it somehow.
---
Lmao not to mention at this stage joining Loot Council guarantees you wont get anything for months
---
Busted.
---
The buffs stack my dude. Its not a meme weap by any means.  
---
Id rather have a 2h warrior swinging this and buffing 3 other people than a BRE or OEB.
---
A normal skeletal warhorse with a dead skeleton that's bugged in the air (from dying after you jump)
---
It is smart thinking...I will gank any hunter trying to tame broken tooth cause I don‚Äôt want to have that stupid cat attacking me late game. See someone farming rep or essence...I‚Äôm going to kill you cause I don‚Äôt want you to have gear that makes you more dangerous. It‚Äôs a competitive game and keeping a competitive edge is vital. I don‚Äôt go around killing ppl 10+ levels under me but most of the other faction is KOS...it‚Äôs why I play PvP. If you don‚Äôt want to WPVP go play on a pve or RP server. Battlegrounds are for equal playing field fights. WPVP is is just murdering the other faction. As mentioned the factions are at war so killing an enemy is what our characters are supposed to do.
---
People will disagree but this is true.
---
Org itself sucks. But the bank and AH area is always PACKED and looks so nice when the server is full.
---
You ALWAYS run past people dueling outside going to/from the zeppelin.
---
The city truly feels alive.
---
Good we don‚Äôt have room for casuals.
---
I have no idea actually because my class has no need for tribute runs. But I heard that from a guildie. Could easily be wrong tbh.
---
Better choice. Less crowded, forsaken rep, but harder quests instead of lengthier running around ones. 
---
10/10 worth it.
---
Yep I'll just dispel nondispellable debuffs in strat
---
I did it at 43-44
---
At this point my guild could do MC naked.
---
The only expected spike in price was with Dire Maul release as it's used for the paladin mount quest.  It should only stay the same or lower in price.
---
And why would the great Mister Lucifron be interested in such peasants opinions?
---
P2 isn't going to fix getting ganked by higher level dudes, they just can't get an honor kill out of you. They might be more inclined to go to higher zones if their intent is to rank up. But if it isn't p2 changes nothing for you.
---
OP MC every week for 3 years /s
---
I do not care about honor or any of that crap.  What I do care about is my future alliance sons being able to exist happily and comfortably in azeroth without interference from subhuman horde filth.
---
I mainly chose Horde for Classic because I played Alliance in vanilla and wanted to see it from the other side.
---
I am enjoying it so far and don't miss alliance one bit.  Although, I do sometimes have to catch myself from saying 'Horde ganing in xxx' to 'Alliance ganing in xxx' but old habits can die hard.
---
Most the times they do it, but sometimes you're insta cleaved.
---
If you are logged in on reddit on the computer it's faster. You can do it in less than 4 seconds. Especially if you're tech literate enough to use a program like sharex. It's really not comparable. All it takes is a couple key strokes.
---
Do BRD until he's 55 or so and then farm pretty much any of the other high level instances. 57+ I like strat runs for quick levels and gear.
---
Hunters are still very very awful at the game. If I see anyone playing a hunter I immediately assume they are brand new to the game and avoid them like the plague. Mages are a new and unique stupidity. There is this whole new group that has emerged after watching JokerD and other streamers farm. They watch youtube and twitch and think they can play just like everyone they've fanboyed over. They cannot, they suck, I find they typically have more knowledge of the game than hunters, but these nuevo-mages are trying to be something they aren't good enough at the game to be. One quick question I've learned can help you determine what kind of mage you have, "So did any of you mages re-reoll to get to 60 faster or have better farming potential?" If they answer "yes" they are these nuevo-mages and most likely will be cancer.
---
Lol, if that's true, I could only wonder how you feel about the current state of emulation and how lackluster Trinitycore is and how nonexistent other cores are.
---
Oh snap, that is a good point. It's too bad there will rarely be a situation where that is useful though.
---
They don‚Äôt give back gold when you post wrong in the ah. If you get scammed via trade/mail like this they do. The other person gets a permaban.
---
Same here. I turned it off because I don't **want** to see a damn notification. Stop telling me they invited me but I blocked it, Blizz. I KNOW I blocked it!
---
With engineering and the correct cooldown rotations, yes you'll kick ass.
---
It needs a bit more gear than other classes before you hit the point you can reliably kill people but honestly, yes it works.
---
Play it, enjoy, and I'll see you on that battlefield.
---
- Caeliah, Razergore EU (Horde)
---
At 44 you should be good to tank. I did at 43 as a warrior with an offspecced healer and we got through.
---
Does anyone know of a better place to read up on theorycrafting etc than icy veins? Something that goes in depth like EJ used to
---
Lol sure is
---
It mostly is.
---
For warriors though some are pretty bad upgrades.
---
It's almost a perfect 50/50 split as far as faction balance. Leveling was great, I've been at 60 for about three weeks now and it seems like the majority of players are in the higher levels. I just rolled an alt and the low level zones see a good amount of player traffic without being too crowded like they were at launch. Population is high and healthy. Last week we got put moved to one layer, so capital cities are very lively. There are almost no queue times (some guildies told me they had 15 minute queues last Friday night after the server got reduced to one layer, but other than that I haven't seen a queue since the 3rd week after launch.) RPing seems to happen mostly within guilds, and overall there seems to be far less of it than you would imagine.
---
You're calling him out for "no evidence" yet you're not supplying evidence of your own to back your statements. You don't know that queue times didn't decrease because of server transfers - which absolutely happened.
---
Where is your empirical analysis? Where are your numbers of retail vs classic? You're biased dude, just admit it. You *want* to see retail numbers look better than classic, and you're using words like "enormous" but what are the numbers?
---
You claim you play both, but you like one more than the other for sure, and that colors your opinions.
---
Yeah doable but it would be awful and very difficult.
---
I only do it to rogues cause f them. Other than that I MC people into situation where you wish I just killed you instead lol.
---
People on here are severely downplaying how much you actively have to play to Reach Rank 11-13.  Imagine it like this.  From 11 to 12 takes 3 weeks of playing approximately 8ish hours per day and no lifing on weekends.  From 12 to 13 Takes approximately 3 to 4 weeks of playing 8 to 10 hours per day, and no lifing on weekends.  Rank 13 to 14 can be done in 4 to 5 weeks and takes no lifing every single day.
---
You're seriously confused if you think I take issue with people needing things they actually need.
---
The OP is talking mainly about Lucifron.
---
Or you know, blizzard can host them on proper machines dedicated specifically for a player load of this magnitude instead of using the same shitty computers that rely on sharding/layering.
---
Cat do scratch. Bear goes roar. Owlbear pew pew. Druid does leaf heals. Smaller cat go zoom. Water bear does a splash.
---
Do you mean for leveling or pvp or group/raid play?
---
Honestly the best thing you can learn for any type of druid is how to use and set up macros
---
Granted, the female orc and troll have perfect posture, its just the stupid hunch they add to every "mean" looking race in the game, including gnolls and the rat miner people.
---
What spec?
---
For levelling or end-game?
---
Tips to play better?
---
Pros and cons of choosing a druid?
---
Help us help you...!
---
Just to make sure I understand you correctly. If I have 100SP, my frostbolts do +32dmg but blizzard only does +4 for the whole spell (all ticks combined, per target)?
---
Name checks out
---
I think you are half right. They do used hacked accounts a lot of the times, however, I think they use those accounts for botting.
---
From what Ive heard, most of the "hacked" accounts are from people that used their website. If they are using their website, they don't any large amount of gold to sell.
---
Class Discords help a lot. Icy Veins is only to get a rough idea.
---
No.  You can't interact with a mouseover macro.  The bobber also doesn't fall in the same space each time.  You need to cast, mouseover the bobber, then right click when it splashes.  There's no other way to automate it.
---
gehennas eu, the biggest server probably.
---
everyone is just lvl 60 lol, there's some ppl still levling (like me)
---
Got it. Thank you! Would you care to share your reasoning behind Toughness vs Iron Will?  
---
To me, toughness seems the better choice for pve while Iron Will would be more useful in pvp. Seems like a toss up and depends a lot on where the player will focus his time.
---
You should be fine with 6%
---
the guy is a rich gm from a big guild
---
Yeah frostbite \*is\* very strong in PvP, however, it completely precludes AoE farming and I think the hybrid where you ditch frostbite for 3/3 improved blizz is a reasonable compromise. You don't win purely because of frostbite but it certainly helps.
---
This is kinda interesting.  If a guard being slightly closer makes this spot vulnerable to guard reaction then it's not a safe spot at all and therefore not a TOS violation.  
---
It's a blind spot in guars patrols/range but these are ok to use.  
---
Not hating here and you've found a v novel and effective solution to the issue, but, it does suggest that this particular spot is guard pathed and therefore ok to gank from.   Least that is how I would interpret this.
---
This sub doesn't use logic
---
That was exactly my point if you bothered reading the whole thread.
---
delusional
---
Should use that guild for his guildies instead of wasting it honestly
---
Some horde spamming "g o T o RE T a IL"
---
31+ prot isn't primarily about mitigation. It's about threat. With low gear you'll want to slap a shield on and get 10% more damage on main hand, 12 rage sunders, and shield slam. You may consider switching it up when you have more crit for flurry uptime and enough armor otherwise not to wear a shield.
---
Have you tried accepting them?? Maybe try just talking to the lonely gold vendors, huh?
---
I‚Äôm 50/0 EpGp  right now, it‚Äôs feels good man.
---
Also on westfall, I get about 2-3 of them per hour so about that rate.
---
Btw when you block them, it still gives you a notification that you were sent a channel invite request.
---
How dare you, Soupa has been an absolute boss. Seriously added to the integrity of the sub.
---
Low effort meme.
---
Here is why it is so good. Optimal druid tanking has you start outside of any form, you do the cast HoT, immediately followed by the instant HoT(I dont know the names of the spells), then bear form, then charge in. You can also then cast the thing that generates rage but lowers your armor (to ensure you're not overhealing yourself). This helps build initial threat on everything, because not only are you generating threat from your tanking rotation, you're also healing yourself, which generates threat on everything(as long as it's not over healing) and the bonus rage generated from that also builds a small amount of threat. Having furor would allow you to use swipe quicker in this situation (because I'm pretty sure you always prioritize maul first. You should also have nagelring and thorns up. If it's a single target pull you can even sneak a moonfire in there. Tanking is all about generating threat as quickly as possible. You always want your threat gen to be "frontloaded". So let's say you have a mage Aoeing doing your pulls this way may delay him pulling aggro of you for like 3 extra seconds. But in those three seconds of the enemies hitting you  you have generated more rage because they are still hitting you, and your thorns and nagelring are also generating more rage because they are still hitting you. You now have rage for a swipe you may not have if they had swapped to attacking the mage. Rage at the beginning of a pull is WAY more valuable. Hope that helps clarify.
---
I know same was enjoying it as well anyone got a youtube link to his channel?
---
Think outside the box and join druid classic discord.
---
Forums hardly exist anymore. Look for a classic warlock discord.
---
Easy fight or should you bring a potion or two?
---
Just dinged 60 on my druid
---
I'm leveling a warrior and always on the lookout for fast weapons like daggers or certain fist weapons, axes, etc. I never see other warriors using them though. They are usually using some slower swords or maces. Faster is better for tanking. 
---
That w/ a shield + a 2H for certain openers. And you should be good go to. Can't comment about endgame.
---
Balance makes the factions great. 
---
If the population gets skewed to either side to much everything falls apart, you don't care about looks, abilities, lore, anything. I hope blizzard has a plan of action for classic
---
Sounds like there was some reason to have utter confidence the TF would remain with the raid team. I don't think that's very common, usually the small guild is liable to break up or be absorbed by a larger guild at any time and poof your raid team lost the TF.
---
why because I can't be convinced through words that something I know to be true because I've literally done it isn't true?
---
pretty sure everyone believes their own experiences over the words of people on the internet thats why I encouraged people to test it.  everyone who did had to come back in shame and lmk I was right
---
Tip 1: learn to google
---
You think we care about posts like this, but we don‚Äôt
---
No, they do ~85 more damage / 2.5 second cast time.
---
&gt;  I envy people that know exactly what they want to play. 
---
I used to be just like you. One day I read about [choise supportive bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice-supportive_bias) and realized that over analyzing choices wasn't going to give me a better experience. 
---
You have obviously researched enough to know what you will like or not like all you need to do now is pull the trigger. Free your self from indecision and your subconscious will reaffirm your choice in the future.  YOU CAN DO IT. Just make sure you don't fall victim of 'grass is greener' syndrome aka becoming and alt-aholic.
---
**Choice-supportive bias**
---
Choice-supportive bias or post-purchase rationalization is the tendency to retroactively ascribe positive attributes to an option one has selected and/or to demote the forgone options. It is part of cognitive science, and is a distinct cognitive bias that occurs once a decision is made. For example, if a person chooses option A instead of option B, they are likely to ignore or downplay the faults of option A while amplifying or subscribing new negative faults to option B. Conversely, they are also likely to notice and amplify the advantages of option A and not notice or de-emphasize those of option B.
---
What is remembered about a decision can be as important as the decision itself, especially in determining how much regret or satisfaction one experiences. Research indicates that the process of making and remembering choices yields memories that tend to be distorted in predictable ways.In cognitive science, one predictable way that memories of choice options are distorted is that positive aspects tend to be remembered as part of the chosen option, whether or not they originally were part of that option, and negative aspects tend to be remembered as part of rejected options.
---
Usually moving to the next trash pull
---
Frost is a very chill play. If you want something more explosive in your life, try leveling as fire.
---
make macros for your abilities so you don't have to cancel form manually. that get's real old real quick.
---
Highest boss is level 47, so you should be at least 44.
---
/r/Bitcoin is leaking :-D
---
I (ally) Was farming runecloth in feralas? Next to another level 60 horde. No problem. Just minding our own business. The horde 1 aggros too many mobs. I run in to help. Peeling off the mob he hasn‚Äôt tagged yet. At first he‚Äôs nervous as to me rushing over but realized I‚Äôm only trying to help so calms down and proceeded to put down the mobs on him. Out of nowhere comes another horde player coming straight at me. Horde 1 ‚Äú/says‚Äù something to the other horde. I imagine something like ‚Äúleave him alone‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù. Horde 2 continues attacking me. I proceed to kill horde 2 (people always forget pallies have 3 lives). Horde 1 continues to farm. 
---
All types of people everywhere.
---
They /roll 40
---
&gt; 5mans, and raids. Offtanking preferably.
---
Try [0/31/20](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/-05050005405010051-5023011053) Fury Prot, that should let you DPS in raids and still offtank as needed. You will be fine in 5-mans. If you want to go a bit more Prot there's [17/3/32](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/30305001302-03-50250112530001051) Impale Prot.
---
But inevitably you come to a still where it's clearly being said "Whoever did not loot the core hound go loot it now." And this is repeated over, and over, and over... yet no one claims the loot lol
---
If you have hots rolling you‚Äôre already dead. You leave bear form for anything at all, you‚Äôre dead. Rogues can easily kill you within their stun window in caster.
---
I like the build! I ended up opting for improved charge, improved overpower, and improved hamstring over the 2h specialization and axe specialization. Only because I didn't really want to specialize in any one weapon type. It's probably not better considering how good the 5% crit for axes is. But I've enjoyed using all the weapon types without worrying that I'm missing out on a talent I picked up. Not sure if I will stick with 31/5/15 at end game or not, but I can always respec into axes/swords/maces specialization depending on the weapons I get.
---
In raids, the single biggest thing is the debuff slot taken up by mortal strike... Typically you want some dot there.
---
In smaller groups, I think gear can keep it very close.. A well geared arms or furry warrior can top dps charts in a group fairly frequently.
---
For what's it worth I played Vanilla as a DPS warrior (switched between arms and furry off and on)
---
I'm 0/30/21 so i'm running around with a potion permanently (NS+HT on myself), if not, bring one with a shift -&gt; drink -&gt; shift macro.  If your gear isn't great, definitely bring one.
---
I bear tank 'em down.  I had pretty decent gear at the time so it wasn't even close.  If your gear isn't great, go for plugger first and trying for a mixologist if possible.  Might be hard, he likes to spam shadow bolts.
---
Mage easily.  1 button rotation, best aoe, food/water, ports, blink/frost armor to escape just about anything, ice block for emergencies.  Very rarely will a group not want a mage.
---
Was lagging out and there wasn't even an ally raid going on.
---
If the server used to have 7-8+ layers and a queue and now has 2 layers and a queue that's quite a massive drop-off of concurrent players. Doesn't mean the game is dead by any means, but it could well mean that a majority of the players who checked it out are no longer playing.
---
Chya. Thunder Bluff is definitely the best of the Horde cities.
---
Why is it not surprising the one that advocates for selfishness also quotes Ben Shapiro.
---
New player here, having trouble getting past level 30. I leveled a warlock to 30, got tired, and rolled a priest because I wanted to get into dungeons faster. When I got to 30, I started getting real fatigued with the alliance leveling experience. Now I've rolled a shaman and I'm worried I'm going to get tired of it too at 30. Any advice? I really want to get to 60 with something. Is there a class I could try or some fun zone I could go to?
---
#1 healer on your server here, this is wrong
---
Does blck the advertisement in chatlog though. Almost as if blizzard was in cahoots with chinese gold farmers...
---
Youre trying to demonstrate that the shield breaks fast, by saying you can't even make it through 1 strat live without it breaking. The example you gave was poor, because it requires improper use of the shield. I can make it through 3 strat lives before it breaks while getting tons of value out of it. That is a more accurate estimate on its usefulness than assuming someone wears it even when tanking a single target mob.
---
 My 70+ year old uncle plays a hunter and loves it.
---
Approximately one every 4-6 hours
---
Pretty sure I‚Äôve read that he already got the drop but it wasn‚Äôt the max roll so is still going.
---
Crafting, selling items and enchants is for making gold so is any kind of farming including AH and gathering. You don't need more than 1.5k gold in classic really, that covers your epic mount and all the consumes you will need. 
---
Dungeons are super easy to be farmed and useless after you have farmed them.
---
Read my prior comment. Reevaluate why all these things make you upset.
---
It's a little bit different.  Although Hunters are mainly ranged, in Classic we also need to be able to melee if we get trapped by an opponent in our dead zone.  It's not something we normally do but Hunters do have melee abilities.  There have been many times in the past when I've Stone Formed and then Wing Clipped an opponent to get back into bow range.  Rogues have shoot and that's it.
---
I just took values from https://sixtyupgrades.com, Frost mage.  
---
&gt;You get 45% spirit regen while casting.  
---
What? In-battle regen is so far in the Arcane tree, that almost nobody take it until 40-50+  
---
When you cast the spell, for 5 seconds you stop getting mana at all. There's no 45% spirit regen.
---
Agree with night elf males. I severely judge people who play night elf males, to the point where I think they must have some kind of mental deficiency.
---
Smolderweb. I start every play session with a live and let live mindset, even helped a troll mage the other day, let him tag U'cha or whatever in Un'goro when I needed him too.
---
But then five whored flood the tunnel and kill me while laughing, spitting and teabagging my corpse. Just imagine variations of that exact encounter and apply them to almost every time I play. I can't defend myself against five. It's just a slaughter.
---
Probably the dagger but you  could farm DM West for the off-hand dagger from the last boss. Easy to do.
---
In the /dkp modes window, you can change "second bidder" to "first bidder" and it will update the cost to the highest bidder rather than the second highest. The "cost" field in the bid window can also be changed at any time.
---
&gt; He's living in your head rent free now. THAT'S why people do it. Grats on being a sucker.
---
But how tf does that translate to enjoyment? Inducing 3/10 frustration in some stranger you'll never meet is interesting enough to spend any amount of time on?
---
Thats why BG's should come out too.
---
But tanks are under enough pressure to keep the pace up without stopping after every pull to skin.
---
I know we could, but it's not as simple as that...
---
You fuckin liar you got busted.
---
Just admit this is a filthy karma whore.
---
The more you deny it the more you seem pathetic
---
Lol that‚Äôs hilarious

[Jame's Alliance Leveling Guide - Chapter I (30-41) [old version]](http://www.wow-pro.com/leveling_guides/jame039s_alliance_leveling_guide_chapter_i_3041_old_version)
---
I think you can start to level arms out with hitting the crit caps.. but furry will always be more consistent.
---
No, Smolderweb, Fairy Tail guild.
---
Just gotta stick with it and find something fun that you like to do. I cannot rerun the same dungeon over and over like some people do. I just do dungeons occasionally for cool loot and quest in the outside world and explore even if its less efficient.
---
THANK YOU
---
Its a small indie company :( what can they do
---
Limited invulnerability potions when you have aggro will make you immune to her physical attacks so she doesnt path to you and she goes to the next person on the threat table. It's worth the cost to have a button you can press to pass her on to the next person on the threat table, lol. Everyone higher than the tank pops it and she goes straight to the tank.
---
Underdogs? Clearly you don't play on a pvp server...
---
Do people not use mouse buttons??
---
My default bar is 1-5 then Mouse4, Mouse5, Mouse3(wheel), mouse wheel up, mouse wheel down
---
The meme
---
Aren't there like 6 or 7 items fury warriors want in MC?  Onslaught, BB, CHT, Striker's, Quick Strike, Accuria?
---
Meh, people with your mentality get passed over for loot and at the end of the day most classes only have 2-3 really good pieces in MC. I would rather give the dedicated players alts the gear then some dude who wants 39 others to carry them to loot.
---
Yeah never cared for raiding in vanilla for that carrot on a stick mechanics and the whole DKP bullshit no thanks not for me.
---
As a casual player, what's my end game life like as a warrior? Say I get to 60 and get BiS as a tank, are raids the only thing after?
---
Wish I went pve, so much wasted time. Someone else said it but pvp servers are more for ganking as there will be world pvp when honor comes out even on pve servers but you don't have to all the time
---
Except when you read top comment and realize it‚Äôs fake and staged for karma
---
You know the original post is just asking a question and doesn't name any people or any instances, so you kinda jumped on the defensive really quick for nothing. That's usually pretty suspect.
---
As for guilds inviting PUG extras to their raids ... if the guild wants to reserve loot, then it's up to said guild to advise everyone BEFORE the raid so that they can make a decision on whether or not they wish to stay. People join raids for the loot. Nobody cares about 'the experience' if said experience is them spending 4 hours for absolutely nothing in return. Now if guild didn't state this condition before the raid started, then people would be justifiably pissed if they are only advised after the first boss is downed. And then don't blame them all if they instantly rage quit from that raid, effectively putting an end to raiding for the week for both the PUGs and host guild.
---
TLDR: Discuss raid loot rules before the raid, not during.
---
As for the OP's question ... he's only looking for a notes addon so they can leave notes about the behaviour of players they encounter and whether or not they wish to play with them in future. This is not strictly for raiding. And it's a highly in demand addon since, let's be honest, there are some real dickhole players out there.
---
That‚Äôs actually really helpful. I think I‚Äôll just pull the trigger on a mage. Who care if they are over populated i just want to turn people into sheeps.
---
Just go straight down towards LOTP and you will be fine. Grindy and shitty levels (quest wise) are coming up, but if you are a fully fletched Feral, you can tank some dungeons and be a very happy panda.
---
Such as?
---
When I hit 30 I started doing a lot of scarlet monastery. It‚Äôs a fun and easy way to level because at 30 -40 one run is between 1/4-1/8 if a level and you bet some great gear. Questing can get boring so I sat go do dungeons.
---
Yea, I Wass shocked with how many elite quests you get in silverpine forest. Had some great moments with randoms completing them though!
---
Slowfall precasted before knockback
---
This karma whore knew exactly what he was doing
---
I like high populations. Sure, I get ganked more often in the higher traffic areas like STV, but I can always go to Desolace or something if I want peace and quiet.
---
With high populations, I get the opportunity to do real
---
world pvp, which, in the 7-8 years that I‚Äôve played WoW, hasn‚Äôt always been the case.
---
If you don‚Äôt like high population servers, could you try switching to a low population server and see if you like it more?
---
Plenty of time for people with jobs too though \^\^ for the past month I havn't been doing much but raid logging and rp events
---
I would punch kids in the face every day if I didn't go to jail for it
---
LOOOOOOOOOOL
---
15% from arcane, 30% from mage armor. Which also provides 15 of each resistance type, so you always keep it up in raid.
---
Try right clicking the buff icon at the top right.  That is how you clear other buffs.
---
In a few weeks there's a decent chance guilds will sell a spot in their raid for that drop specifically.
---
I feel like you guys are missing the point.  OP described this person as an "extremely casual player."  They're unlikely to be in raids, and leveling dungeons aren't that challenging.
---
Paladin is a great recommendation and probably OP's best bet.
---
What's the negative connotation?
---
 You'll want to mix in tier1/tier2 pieces with your strongest feral gear that also provides at least 5% +. Also the pvp set for the 4 piece set bonus. prio stam &gt; int &gt; everything else
---
&gt; Faster is better for tanking.
---
It is really not that simple.  Faster is better if you have infinite rage.  Otherwise it becomes a little more complex.
---
Granted I am talking specifically about endgame so slightly different perspective I guess.
---
Its the little things. Like forcing alliance scum to jump off the boat when it is WAAAAY out there in the water. Things like that.
---
icy veins has a pretty good leveling guide that talk through what would worth paying for an upgrade vs. waiting until later.
---

---
I don't know, this is my first time in what looks like a pretty serious raiding guild. All I know is in a previous raid I already had to step in to tank twice when the other feral died (he was in full cat dps gear). They also made a warrior a guild lead for rogues temporarily because he knows how to play rogues or something.
---
Druid here. Past two weeks of MC and ony I‚Äôve had the blessing of winning rolls and I have 5/8 tier 1 gear with some rings and a tier 2 helm from drops
---
THANK YOU!
---
People complain about horde (specifically undead) but the amount of GNOME rogue/mage/warlocks that gank me while being 6+ levels higher and/or Im fighting mobs is beyond count. Dwarves/human/Night elves are generally chill people that are happy to quest along side me and we dont bother eachother. Gnomes on the other hand seem to have a vendetta, being as annoying as possible and will only fight when they have the upper hand. I've never been in a fair fight once the entire time Ive been playing.
---
My kill on sight list isn't very long, only 6 players and they're all gnomes.
---
Maybe if all the little alliance babies would leave their RP and PvE servers... ;)
---
But it isn't no changes! We have like 15+ changes already and counting. Not to mention that experience will never be the same because we already know the game like an open book. The time we would spent discovering mysterious quests and drops isn't there anymore. Henceforth eveyrthing gets boring fast
---
Yeah that's probably better than the Dal'Rend OH.
---
You would have the time in theory, if your alt is parked outside and no respawn and already in the same group etc.
---
**However**, it won't work since everything apart from The Tribute you can't loot since your alt needs to be present for the kill of said mob/boss in order to be eligible to loot the item.
---
Hmm. Without to much current experience in raiding, so just going off of memory here, it sounds about normal tbh.
---
If "kill stuff, get loot" is your prefered raiding experience then I would be reluctant to advice you to continue with classic raidingüòî
---
I only ever got in to ZG and Ony before TBC launched  and I honestly can not remember ever getting a boss drop at all (maybe 7-9 ZG runs).
---
I know I got some idols and a thrash drops,but competition is fierce in 40mans.
---
I would urge you to be patient tho, it'll be great once your time comesüòä
---
Frostradamus streams on Youtube and Twitch. He focuses primarily on farming. His videos are great for ideas of where/what to farm.
---
He has a farming set .- which includes pieces from the Necropile set.
---
Is this on Herod? I know a dude my that name.
---
Your frostbolt deals an extra 32.57 **DPS** if you have 100 SP.
---
Your blizzard deals an extra 4 **DPS** (4 damage per tick.)
---
I won't say all whored are like this but most just see you and make a beeline for you, while their friends circle around and come at you like a pack of raptors.
---
I start every session with a live and let live attitude but after dying to overwhelming numbers or overwhelming level/gear advantage so many times I just start killing everyone because if you kill them first they can't jump you.
---
Same on mine but on the horde side. Thankfully I'm alliance :3
---
Honestly, you can pick whatever gear you what fitting your playstyle.
---
Alot - or most - druids wear pure Healgear and try to outlast they enemy.
---
For me, personally, I am deep feral right now with Omen of Clarity.
---
I will try HotW/NS as well, but with hybrid gear and more Feral focused.
---
you cant
---
Oh I'm sure the Brutality Blade and Core Hound Tooth will always be given to Fury Warriors and Rogues over Hunters until I'm in a run where they all have them.  I highly doubt that will happen before BWL comes out.  If they decide not to let me roll on the bow/gun or hunter quest item from Major Domo that's another story.
---
Thanks. Ultimately I want to PVP. Was thinking about raiding only as a means to get gear I would use for PVPing. I don‚Äôt understand what items I should be going for yet though.
---
One other reason daggers are a good choice is the availability of weapon skill. If you're not human or orc, you should look for ways to improve your weapon skill to 305.
---
For daggers, you have Mugger's Belt (DM) to get there. Later you can upgrade to Aged Core Leather Gloves (MC).
---
xD
---
So we need BG's
---
Thank you :3
---
Yes it does, pretty easy too see when leveling up Weapon skills from low amounts. Crit chance increases by 0.04% per skill level
---
Only a scam if done on purpose! Im sure that guy just missclicked
---
You think you do but you dont.
---
&gt; mage and hunter are both VERY strong and have a super easy time doing everything in the game with only a few buttons to press. Theyre very forgiving w/ escape tools too
---
This isn't true.  Mages and Hunters require far more micromanaging than for which you're giving them credit.
---
Yeah, "frostbolt lol" meme for Mages, but we all know it's not literally that simple.  If a Mage accidentally pulls more then one mob, it takes a lot of quick reactions to make it out alive.  Ditto a Hunter - plus you've got to manage your pet too.
---
Paladin is the absolute best suggestion.

---
&gt; to your fav game, bud. 
---
Sorry I can't take you serious after that statement anymore. Lmao. 
---
&gt; That doesn't mean the game is bad 
---
Since when does popularity have any correlation with quality? 
---
I am just sick of Blizzards (and their fanboy retail sheeps) story of nobody actually wanting to play vanilla wow.
---
Should have maybe blocked out his name. Boy is on blast now.
---
You are a better friend than me, I specifically try to position groups so people get punted out of the window.
---
The bonus is something like +40% in a group, which is replaced by a -50% penalty if you're in a raid. So the experience given by each mob drops to about a third, and since the experience is still split evenly between all players, you'll get about 1/6 the amount of experience per mob in a 10-man raid as you would in a 5-man group.
---
I doubt they‚Äôll be worth much. The gear they create I believe or boe so people will likely just buy the gear.
---
yummy :P
---
Awesome! Thank you very much!
---
TLDR ‚ÄúPlease tell me how to play a fairly basic game that‚Äôs been out for 15 years‚Äù
---
When you consider the small amount of crit added, shrouded mist is equiv in dps and adds some stamina and resists. So yeah it‚Äôs a slight leg up for hunters 
---
And is there not a diremaul cloak that adds stamina agi and 1% dodge or something? I would think that takes prio
---
You asked for an answer about bullying. He answered you in a roleplaying way and you bully him..
---
Drillborer provides more damage from shield slam, so in a phase where people comfortably tank all of MC as fury prot with less than 340 defense, you will be just fine.
---
hunters were still mana users and their racial was really helpful for a quick mana pot.
---
When you play an Orc warrior, the first quest says that you are "finally of age".
---
While the actual warrior quest that arrives soon after says you are already a veteran, but that you have not fought in a long time and need to retrain.
---
Is it normal to be placed in a melee group as a hunter in raids to give melee my trueshot aura attack power buff? By doing this I miss out on grace of air totem which is 67 agi and is huge for my dps (1.1% crit + 134 attack power). Instead I get windfury which is useless for me.
---
Grats :).  Ill be heading back tonight in search of the Gloves/Shoulders for my warrior.  Got lucky yesterday and in 3 runs I got Ravager, Shield, Head.
---
You have to be there when the boss is tapped to be able to loot it.
---
&gt; right after he gets it, he laughs at us, thanks us for helping him out, and goes on to form his own raiding guild or join another.
---
From an outside perspective, this is no more or less likely than you doing the exact same thing. I's also extremely unlikely in either case. After all, why would anybody want to leave a successful group that has allowed him to get a very prestigious item?
---
You're assuming that being part of the guild ensures loyalty. It doesn't. Instead, you should judge people on their past behavior. And from what you're telling us, the guy seems to have shown exemplary behavior. The fact that he prefers not to join a large guild is understandable. It's noisy, there's drama, people come and go all the time and guild runs end up being semi-pugs anyway since you don't know half the people.
---
From where I stand, it looks to me that you believe you are more entitled to the fruits of a common achievement (by the raid group) than your peer simply based on the fact that you're part of a majority (the larger of the two guilds). 
---
It's just a game, it's just a virtual item, it's not worth fighting over but I believe that, morally, you're in the wrong.
---
INC
---
Nah, flurry is way more powerful than anything in the arms tree.
---
Even 2h slam spec blows arms dps out of the water.
---
I just carve their name into my belly skin
---
Iv only had like 4 or 5 in the last 2 months. Hard to imagine others are getting them constantly.
---
This depends rly.  In a pug fair enough.  But in a guild run where it's a very minor up for you, and a bis for 3+ months on a key guildy then you shld pass imo.
---
See at low levels that was true but mana tap and arcane torrent just scaled so god damn horribly. I think max restore was like 300 mana at level 70 which is a terrible amount.
---
And yet I have two pieces.
---
People roll os and ms. Easy system.
---
Can tribute runs be done as a 10 man raid?
---
The chances that I‚Äôd actually get those items is pretty slim too, seeing as I don‚Äôt really have time to raid. I‚Äôm thinking troll mage would be the best bet. Or undead mage / warlock as I could get a raptor when I‚Äôm exalted with them.
---
&gt;cult in ST, and without strong healers is impossible in BRD. At this point, you'll still charge in with a 2H and sweeping strikes + w
---
If you're level 40, max arms first for mortal strike. Lower than that, a hybrid is fine but plan to respec at 40.
---
Not that I can think of, if you want to combine three spells you'd want a castsequence macro. Try
---
    #showtooltip
---
    /castsequence reset=10 Bear Form, Nature's Grasp, Frenzied Regeneration
---
If you're already in Bear form I suspect that this will either not do anything or swap you back to caster form. Try this slight variation
---
    /castsequence reset=10 !Bear Form, Nature's Grasp, Frenzied Regeneration
---
If I think of a better solution I'll post it.
---
it is coming! in a couple of days. But i won't be posting them here, cuz too much repetition. So be sure to follow me on instagram or twitter @ima_dreamwalker
---
nice
---
I would do what I did when TBC originally released..... roll a BE Paladin. A tank that is amazing at aoe tanking, and that aoe silence. mmmmmm
---
hahahha yeess :P
---
Yup, if you pull parses - he's still doing decent DPS. He won't be top tier, but with WF and the stacking buffs - with your best 3 dps - it absolutely makes perfect sense to push through bosses.
---
Certain situations and bosses for dps dump is absolutely worth it to have this.
---
Not a very helpful response. ONCE you are raid geared and have a slot in a guild that has MC and Onyxia on farm, then sure.  OP's challenge is how (/if) he can get there on 5 hours week.
---
@OP nothing is impossible,  but if you are enjoying the game as it is, I would just carry on doing that!
---
The beauty of Classic (v Retail) is that it is not all about the endgame.  The journey to60 is as important and as fun as what happens when you get to 60.
---
Is it? We‚Äôve been clearing MC for a while now.
---
VD?

Could be an alt for a hardcore player. There was a ton of money making opportunities in the first 3-4 weeks of the game. If you rushed to 60, you could free farm tons of endgame consumables. If you had any private server experience, you'd know what was undervalued. Stuff like gold pearls were anywhere from 5-10g during the leveling phase...they're worth 40-50g on my server now.
---
Am from NZ. The sky does really weird things during sunset/sunrise over here.  Straya is just over the ditch, so can vouch for Southern Hemisphere colour voodoo.
---
same population
---
That's because they are an incapacitate, not a stun, despite what the tooltip says.
---
Nothing wrong with releasing TBC or even Wrath but it would have to be modified versions of the originals to keep the Classic gameplay and not push it toward retail.
---
/wave

Mage best class in classic ;)
---
Will this enable me to constantly have the world map up without blocking my screen?
---
I haven't touched my keyboard for a skill ever, I just click the buttons with my mouse.   
---
It has 12 buttons on the side with everything mapped, shift ctrl and alt do additional action bars.

 I dont just level up any ability as ive seen before on guides. Like theres many talents i dont buy/unlock bc ill never use them and have been told they are useless.

200\~500g on mine.

Blacking jacking vs ardy knight

Lmao ughh Block Value is basically worthless, do you even know how BV works? As i mentioned in a lower comment you can see the calculations of the value. They're negligible and are viewed as 1A and 1B.

thank you :3

I have evidence showing you are wrong and a tool for spreading misinformation. I'm perfectly happy leaving it at that if you are.
---
&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
---
Sent you a PM!
---
Sounds to me you should go paladin. But I mean you can‚Äôt have it all.
---
Every class is complex if you try and dive into the details. But the basic function of a paladin is very simple. There auto attack Andy meme exists for a reason.
---
You will be surprise what you can and can't pickpocket so just try everything.  Yeti and Owlbeast are humanoid but you can't pickpocket; a lot of undead you can.  Oddly you can pickpocket most oozes.  In dungeons I recommend just tab target and spam pickpocket; gives the tank a moment to get agro and you loot!
---
SM armoury and cath and then RFD. And then Mara
---
Cath, rfd than at 44 zf
---
I didnt know mortal strike took up a debuff slot! Thank you!
---
what a compliment! thank you :3
---
...which would disturb human players but for bots it makes absolutely no difference.
---
If you haven't done your warrior quest for the WW axe, do it.
---
I use it like "far out".  
---
Won that roll? say yeet
---
I'm an undead warrior as well for the exact same reasons haha. will of the forsaken is no joke though for warrior pvp
---
You get them more at different levels. You get a ton at 60, 40, and like 10. They go after the people that are looking to spend but may not have.
---
Awesome, thanks a lot for that! :-)
---
&gt;  it takes a lot of quick reactions to make it out alive
---
Frost nova, blink. I roll a mage and it really is quite that simple, you don't have to over-complicate a simple issue. Plus there's sheep, ice block/barrier, frost slows, the QOL of teleporting everywhere and sustaining yourself on food/water. This class pick goes beyond pulling an extra mob, OP wants a very simply character and mage is definitely a top pick.
---
If you all end up making new alts I am in.
---
once every 15 min on Bigglesworth
---
What sort of macros are you talking about? I'm maining a bear tank rn, fwiw
---
Highborne Star
---
Probably "That guy is the opposite faction. He should die" and that's that. You're overthinking this is you're under the impression that people are getting some great satisfaction about it.
---
TF is hunter 1h legendary bis. Fight me.
---
Did that at around 33/34.
---
Dude it's a joke.
---
What's even the point of these? out of curiosity I joined one (I was going to mess with them) but there was NOTHING. I started asking about gold and wondered if they were going to try and sell me something but they were absolutely quiet.
---
If you mean strikers mark then that is BIS for rogues too but rly only as a stat stick.  Happy to roll for it against the raids rogues/warrs ?  Or feel you shld get prio as you will find more use from it?
---
What's the disc
---
Guess I just missed it lol
---
Which is what I said
---
Yes I have about 6 pieces or so I switch out of. My dm n farm set has 3.1k hp and 5.5k mana which is all generic green eagle or int Stam gear from AH. I gave my chest +100 hp Bc it was cheap. I have prebis gear sprinkled in with it and also keep that gear in my bag for the dm n first boss. I never die on dogs but I also don‚Äôt do the ice block method I do r1 blizz the corner and then run aside to frost nova double blizz nova in corner, flamestrike coc arcane explosion gg easy try it.
---
Gnomish BOP items are Gnomish Death Ray and Gnomish Battle Chicken.
---
Death ray is nice for classes that don't have a big burst spell, but ones that do (casters/hunters) are better off casting that instead.
---
Battle chicken is decent as an annoyance in pvp (it has quite a bit of health) and provides melee haste buff which can be useful in raids.
---
Everything else is either irrelevant, requires active gnomish engineering (transporter) or is BOE.
---
You can name transfer between your own accounts but you have a 30 day grace period from when you delete a character and that name becomes available to other players. I assume this is for characters over level 10
---
RFD, get those plate pieces.
---
Definitely join a guild for the reasons already mentioned.
---
In the early stages of raiding, when everyone needs everything, it's going to take a couple months for the more populated classes (warriors, rogues, mages, priests, etc.) to feel like they're making much progress.
---
But after you reach a certain threshold of time, and assuming that your raid team stays relatively consistent, people are going to be more frequently passing on items than bidding / rolling on them. Things will start flowing in more consistently at that point.
---
The goal should be to get the raid on farm with your raid team, and then everyone will start getting geared quickly.
---
Druid is a blast to play
---
What he said. Technically the best path is to grab cruelty first, then move up the armsthree, then respec at 40 to grab Mortal Strike, and then grab cruelty again.
---
But I'm cheap, so I just leveled arms and got cruelty later.
---
Mark targets before pull. 
---
If these people won't behave, make the hunter + dps warrior cooperate and take down the adds first. 
---
When pulling use LOS to get the ranged next to melee so the AOE's hit them all for threat. 
---
I'm guessing demo is a warlock. Use voidwalker to offtank a mob on pulls.
---
Casters + weak guys are priority kills. 
---
Lastly, warrior is overwhelmed so have them triage and get the mobs off the druid. If the DPS won't cooperate tell the druid to stop healing the DPS until they learn the lesson.
---
not if they have to constantly go thru their list
---
Honestly, Alliance appeals to me more than Horde. All my friends were Horde when it got suggested to try so I went with it, but maybe I'll create a side character to feel that side.
---
100% agreed. I started putting every person spamming reserved runs on ignore and my LFG channel is much better.
---
https://discord.gg/jXrAuKQ
---
This sub sure loves the word entitled
---
I was a 12-year-old noob in Vanilla, but now I'm a 26-year-old min maxing no life loser like I always aspired to be!
---
I mean it's as simple as just not joining the groups where the item you want is reserved, is it not? If it's a group looking for a tank but reserving a tank item they'll probably look for hours and then disband before even stepping foot in the dungeon. 
---
But how does that affect you?
---
Why a discord server and not a webpage/wiki?
---
saw esfand accidentally jump over the fence there ha
---
Yeah sorry, give me pure bc on separate servers. Screw bc with vanilla design
---
Yup! Although it's usually not efficient
---
I was a BC baby, I would hop into BC servers in a heartbeat for my own personal redemption for my mistakes back then, vanilla for me has given me taste of redemption for never stance dancing back in the day and tanking strat. I would love to hop back into Kara as a much better tank than I was then, the reason I love tanking is that I always feel like I'm getting better, learning more, become more efficient. Also I miss my belf retranger alt.
---
Don't join the groups then.  If those people can't find groups then situation solves itself.  If people are joining their groups, then enough people don't care about it.
---
I love all the answers. Thanks for asking this. I felt like I was getting my ass beat in ZF trying to farm (fairly fresh 60, still wearing the staff from SM: L), but it seems clear most of my issue is not having enough mana. I tend to run out before the mobs are completely dead, and that's what gets me killed. I mean, when my inability to tell range isn't what's killing me. (I'm a frostfire spec for Shatter+FS+CoC+Explosion and having the exact right distance to hit with Arcane Explosion while not being in leeway is not easy for me.)
---
I also have this issue where some mobs stay nova'd 2 seconds longer than everyone else and my pull gets fucked up, but that might be because I'm not grouping them up tightly enough for the FS+CoC+Exp. to hit them all?
---
Anyway, looks like I'll be hitting up some dungeons for some gear if I can...lol.
---
&gt;Honestly in terms of simplicity I would recommended a ... shaman
---
Are we even playing the same game???
---
I applaud anyone that can sit through 60 levels on a second character. I honestly can‚Äôt.
---
The reason people hate pugging is because people think waiting for around 50% to heal is a good idea. Hey guess what you waited until 50% and then you got HoJ‚Äôd. Tank just died or now you‚Äôre blowing CDs because instead of just casting downranked heals like a normal person you decided to spend half the fight afk.
---
Nice. Resistances are clutch
---
i get the lashers cause i do them nearly every day on my pally now but how to solo the elemental boss?
---
Improved Drain Soul is an absolutely garbage talent. It's like poor man's Spirit Tap ... on a class that never has mana issues in the first place due to Life Tap.
---
Just no.
---
Yeah I'm calling bullshit on his claims... Our top 5 DPS for every fight is our 2 DPS warrs and 3 rogues.  Excluding Baron/Shazz.
---
I havent even seen a hunter top 10, which maybe points more toward our hunters skill but still.
---
Hoarding points only hurts your guild if it causes your guild to DE loot. It's still early enough that OP's guild hasn't wasted any loot yet. By the time they _would_ be wasting loot, that means nobody is bidding, and OP can just bid 1 on everything they need (if they're using DKP). If they're using EPGP, they *might* start hurting the guild since they don't want to waste GP before getting their Mageblade.
---
I wouldn't have thought that they do, either. But they do.
---
Hold right click at all times. Do. Not. Ever. Turn. With. Your. Keyboard.  Always use the mouse for all movements (press both clicks same time) a true pro unbinds s, a and d keys. Night be hard at first but it will make you 100 times better
---
It's a hard knock life as a warrior. There were multiple times I ignored an alliance only to have them open up on me when I turned my back, the odds of you winning a battle against any ranged class without getting the initial charge on them is roughly 0%
---
Some helpful macros for you...
---
Cancel form + cast
---
    /cancelform
---
    /cast &lt;insert spell&gt;
---
Cancel form + cast on mouseover target
---
    /cast [target=mouseover,exists][] &lt;insert spell&gt;
---
Add \`(Rank #)\` to the end of a spell to downrank it
---
xp is split evenly among group members present for the kill
---
in a group of 3-5 players, a "group bonus" is applied to the amount to incentivize group play, particularly in dungeons
---
at 6 players, a "raid penalty" of half of the xp is removed
---
so the end result looks like this
---
kill the mob alone - 100 xp  
---
kill the mob with one other dude - 50 xp  
---
kill the mob with three other dudes - 25 xp + 10 xp group bonus  
---
kill the mob with nine other dudes - 10 xp - 5 xp raid penalty

How is it entitled?
---
You need to find an enhance shammy who's totem twisting ;)
---
Sounds like what they get is salt mined directly from people posting on reddit.
---
about one every 15 minutes on Incendius
---
Haha I had meant the gamer girl water comment, but it is good to have a stcked pet!
---
A general tip to make it all a bit more relaxed: You don't need to do everything right away. :) It is okay to not have a profession and only pick one up later at a much higher level. It is also okay to _not_ build a character around what would be optimal for raids. You can buy yourself the freedom to redistribute your talent points later, should you so desire.
---
What's the most fun: Friendly random encounters with other players! Helping others to kill that elite mob or finish that quest. Forming a group to fight together and enjoy mutual gratefulness. That were to me (I'm a noob) the most fun and nice moments!
---
Money tip: Pick one gathering profession, e.g. mining, skinning, herbalism and sell what you collect for an easy way to make money. The crafting professions can be quite costly and money is something that you just don't have a lot of at first. You can take one of those costly professions later on :)
---
Lastly, some mechanical things that were not clear to me:
---
1. that you only get talent points after level 10 or so. I was wondering about what on earth the guides I read were talking about?!
---
2. you need to buy skills from your class trainer
---
3. you need to pull upgraded skills into your action bar to actually use the upgraded version
---
Minor inconvenience only, but seeing the same LFM message in the channel for an hour straight, adding to the endless hail of messages obfuscating the one you're truly looking for, is annoying
---
That's pretty much how I see it as well, but you'd have to be doing a whole helluva lot of PvP for the 9% to be a significant factor in your fights whereas armor will always be relevant in both PvE and PvP (unless you're against a caster)
---
&gt; debuff slot taken up by mortal strike 
---
Debuff limit is 16 in Classic instead of the 8 in vanilla... so not remotely as much of an issue as it was back then.
---
It‚Äôs not exactly common I‚Äôd say. Especially when you likely have 6 DPS warrs wanting them and maybe even two tanks too.
---
Don‚Äôt heal or tank. Play a hunter or warlock. People saying Paladins are out of their minds tbh.
---
Dont join them or lead your own group.   
---
Some people get sick of running and losing their item over and over again.   Some people have done their dungeon over 50 times and are fed up with it.
---
I‚Äôd play TBC yeah, vanilla is great but tbc was certainly better (in my opinion.) plus as you said Pallys could actually tank and pally is my favorite class and I love tanking.
---
I think I'm wrong about it changing icons and will always gouge first but will use bandage if gouge is on cool down. Only combo I use this for is nature's swiftness + max rank heal and it may not work for gouge and bandage the way I think
---
I want a mix of both tbh. There are some stuff I hate and love in both. But I doubt anyhting will happen as blizzard keeps proving that they are a scummy company. Honestly right now there isn't much to do and you can't unsub before there is because you will miss raidlogs the 1 content that the game is revolved around right now.
---
Only if your definition of kicking ass involves being an unkillable buff machine. The other poster is trying to trick people in to playing Ret because he is Horde and wants the enemy team to be full of the most useless dps spec in the game.
---
BlizzEArd bad!
---
All the hate.... what difference is it if it‚Äôs a hunter or mage or lock or whatever. You had an idiot in your group. Leave/kick , add to ignore, carry on.
---
I play mage, I don‚Äôt pull agro, I give water and food and portals. People are asking me to join their party, not because I do good dmg or I give free regents. It‚Äôs because I am trying to be nice with everyone.
---
Also you will be surprised how often I get wisp for portals..... I am not doing a raid group and opening portals for all 20+ people. It‚Äôs all about community in classic. Build one!
---
Like I said, I love old school ret, but the DPS and tanking (was originally prot) are shit.
---
I burned out at 45, went back to retail after a few months away. Having a blast with it!
---

If the people taking your account were able to do it with the authenticator on your phone, there is a serious security hole in blizzard's software, or your phone is compromised, or one of the network you used was sniffing packets. Thats usually too much effort so it deters people because it isn't worth it.
---
PVE server -------------&gt; that way
---
Yeah sorry, demo is short for d√©moniste in french which translates to warlock. Pb is that in wow mobs have no problem hitting through hills/walls. It makes los pulling a lot harder
---
No, I didn't, and no, they're not.  The reason being that it only effects off-hand damage.
---
How hit scales isn't the way you'd think.  The hit tables are weird. Basically, by stacking +hit, you're not only increasing how often you hit (and therefore the raw number of crits you get), you're actually "shifting" your hits upward on the to-hit table, so stacking more +hit actually increases how often you crit *as a proportion of your swings that hit*.
---
&gt;Org is the best city.
---
That's a weird way to spell Thunder Bluff friend
---
Shadowplay exists.
---
Who tf goes thru all that instead of jumping. They deserve it lol.
---
Though you're thinking rogue is out of the question I thinks it's been really easy to level so far, rotation is basically 2 buttons. Stealth is an insane crutch tool. Saying both of these things has made me think druid
---
I was looking forward to big pvp and phase 2. Then grob went 1 layer and lags out with 200 people in the zone, and I realize the dream is dead.
---
Why not buy T1 and then once that's done, skip a few weeks and PUG MC for an actual chance at the weapons? Double win?
---
Ok so according to the icy veins guide posted in here it has to run full arms until level 60 then respec to fury, so where is all of this i should run arms coming from if this guide is telling me not to until lvl 60?
---
Whitemane
---
Bounces back after 3 days max.
---
Yep, each melee attack can, of which Hamstring is one.
---
rend doesn't build rage--only white damage (and damage taken) builds rage. 
---
rend does build threat over time, but it's a miniscule amount of threat. Rend ticks for soooo little. It's like 20 something dmg a tick. You're auto attacking for 100-200. shield slamming for 300-500 + the passive extra threat on shield slam. Rend's threat is a drop in the bucket and not worth the GCD since you could have just used sunder armor instead and dealt more threat than the entire rend will probably deal. 
---
also rend takes up a debuff slot which in raids would otherwise go to a more damaging warlock dot or something
---
Basic bitches.
---
Want to know why this will literally never change? Why it evolved to be so common? It is effective. Some people take it too far but reserving will literally never go away.
---
There are other factors that contribute to it's difficulty. The fact that UBRS is not a 5 man means there is more competition for rolling. Also the fact that Reed is BiS for so many classes. These factors mean that it is one of the most contested items. There are certainly more difficult BiS items to farm but it is not easy in comparison to the many items with normal drop rates in 5 man dungeons.
---
Nope, it gives AP, doesn't say anything about ranged only.
---
So get a guild group - you don't own the rights to an item that hasn't even dropped.  How infantile.
---
Of course...  And I do take a look eventually.  Just pointing out that sometimes there are other priorities besides clicking on the sparklies.
---
...eventually it gets looted and skinned.  I seem to recall an add-on that would show who specifically has loot on a corpse.  Does such a thing exist, or did they just add that to the tooltips in a later expansion?
---
Thanks for your constructive feedback
---
I tried to go back to retail but I just can't.
---
It's completely asocial, gear feels worthless as you keep getting a new piece constantly and there's no identity to the gear just pick the one with the highest ilvl no matter the bonuses (they are all the same anyhow). Constant checklist of stuff I have to do to keep up for the day, world is completely barren etc.
---
I would pay to switch to alliance
---
Interesting, I hadn't realised there was a conscious effort to shift its meaning. Good for them though, I wish the same happened with other similar words as well
---
Alliance can turtle for literally days
---
Fun fact - Due to their small size gnomes have proportionally bigger assholes than any other race.
---
Man I really don't have time for people like you. Go on the warrior discord and get laughed at for trying to go 11% hit lol.
---
If your offhand cannot miss, and you are heroic striking 50-60% of your autos, then that 1% hit only benefits 50-40% of your MAINhands attacks, enjoy your 0.1% dps increase per hit.
---
2, 8, and 24 hours are the durations in  Classic. 
---
Neutral AH might have 48 hours? Not sure.
---
Demanding others give up their right to roll on an item that hasn't even dropped yet because it "belongs to you" is the definition of entitled.

**[NA][A][PVP][PST] [&lt;Hurricane&gt;](https://puu.sh/E76SK/7d8bdfff72.jpg) Raiding &amp; WPvP, Grobbulus RPPvP, optional RP**
---
___
---
Are you a seasoned player yearning for the old-style world PVP experience, and you want a guild designed around that need? Or are you unfamiliar with Classic, and want a supportive and organized community to provide you with the environment, advice, and the backup you will need to survive on a PVP server?
---
#####What we do:
---
* Weekly city raids. If you‚Äôre unfamiliar with city raids let us know in advance, we can bring newbies up to speed on the do's and don‚Äôts of zerg vs zerg PvP
---
* Support our members and cultivate violence by prioritizing fast response to guildies under attack in the world
---
* PVE to PVP. 3 scheduled raids a week, 2 PvE and 1 City. Days are finalized to be Mondays and Tuesdays, 5-8 PM PST. If you cannot commit to those times, we have a second raid roster on Saturday and Sunday 5-8PM PST. However, for both rosters we have a dedicated wPvP day on Thursday 5-8PM PST. **We will distribute loot with a modified DKP system** with class-specific sanity checks (Sorry Hunters, you can‚Äôt roll on the bindings). In addition to raids, DKP will also be awarded for wPvP attendance and raid roster slots will be open to those that consistently attends them
---
#####Who we are:
---
* Seasoned vanilla players returning from the private server circuit
---
* A friendly tight-knit group who share a common interest in classic and other games
---
* Our culture is strictly old-school - we have loads of fun but won‚Äôt stand for pettiness, harassment, racism, or consistent mindless regurgitation of tired memes
---
#####Who we want:
---
* Guild oriented: helps others get their pre-raid BiS, and reasonably expects the same in return; willing to sacrifice their personal time to help protect members as they level, when it is both necessary and reasonable to do so
---
* Someone who‚Äôs friendly, willing to learn, communicative on Discord, and loves world PvP
---
* Punctual to whatever scheduled events they commit to
---
Regardless of your experience, we can take you in and teach you. If you‚Äôre a grizzled veteran craving that classic feeling that hooked you so many years ago, or If you‚Äôre a curious retailer who is uncertain on how far they intend to go with vanilla ‚Äì you‚Äôre welcome, and you‚Äôre wanted.
---

#RECRUITMENT STATUS: RECRUITING ALL CLASSES LEVELS 25+
---
Most people wanted no changes for vanilla because they like vanilla gameplay. They want changes for TBC/WotLK if they come out because they are not like vanilla gameplay. Most of these people also don't particularly want TBC or higher if it pulls away from vanilla like it did in retail.
---
It's a consistent viewpoint.
---
Would you like me to post a clip when phase 2 launches? What about phase 3 (BGs)?
---
No one wanted an OEB? You alliance?
---
Raided 2 weeks got 2 dagger and the crit gun.
---
You won't get as much xp as in a 5 man group and more importantly you cannot complete quests in a raid group. My guild typically only does 5 mans if we have quests, but if not we all just goof around together in an instance.
---
Yr a joke bud
---
Dagger is too much fun, didn't care for sword spec because it's garbage in pvp. I've had 0 issues in raids or dungeons due to improved sap and the utility sub brings. I also have a few alts I'm working on and finished a 19 pvp twink. Mix it up a bit and stop with the retailesque obsession with min/max
---
This depends, first I am assuming you are behind these people in points and thus know you are not getting the first ones.  If you are "leading' with points, I'd continue to hold out for the weapons since they are much bigger than the Nightslayer/bloodfang dps increases.
---
If you are behind I'd suggst you figure out what you want and what has the least competition.  I am in a guild with like 4 sword rogues as well as fury warrior who all want the swords.  There is one other dagger rogue so I went daggers because I don't care as much.  I'll end up getting the daggers before most of them get their swords barring ridiculously bad luck on my end.
---
Replace all music with Bonetrousle
---
Why would I want shadow wrath over eagle as a warlock?
---
Okay tried it again here, otherwise I can also message you on discord if reddit has hiccups again
---
dru/war vs dru/war dps cross kill
---
I've got a piss bottle and a shitsock kid we're playing til the server goes down
---
It's the consequence of no dishonorable kills in the game yet
---
Looks like someone got friend zoned pretty hard
---
It's not BS. Hunters are actually one of the better dps classes earlier on in classic, but they scale worse than others. Also, our guild doesn't do any of the cleave strategies that would favor warriors.
---
I like to go to Hillsbrad and tell the lowbies to let me know when they're getting ganked. I wont forget what happened there on launch weekend
---
Anyone know what genre this song is part of?
---
You the real MVP.
---
Maybe its because I don't have Combat to compare it to but I've been having a ton of fun leveling my rogue as sub daggers. What exactly is the issue with spell batching you're having? 
---
Maybe you could help the burnout by making an alt that plays completely differently than rogue and letting yourself get a full rest bar.
---
MoveAnything is an addon that lets you move literally any window in the game.
---
Try doing this on full retail relams. At best you see 20-40 people between AH and the bank.
---
I misunderstood the gist of your post then, apologies.
---
As for black and white vs grey, I know that real life is grey but in discussions, we can aim for absolutes. Or maybe we shouldn't, a question for philosophers I guess.
---
I lost on Spinal to loot council bullshit tonight.  BEWARE the woes of loot council.  Friends will always vote for their RL friends no matter the logic.
---
Why would enh shamans want edgemasters?  It doesn't give bonuses to 2H weapon skill.
---
Ah I thought it was players too.  Oh well.
---
I identify with this comment so much hahaha
---
I am so glad that hunters can't use 2H maces.
---
The druid‚Äôs face looks as unamused as my dog‚Äôs face does when we gave him reindeer antlers at Christmas
---
What?  You mean to tell me the party leader didn't "reserve" it?
---
No, you dont kick anything. You just outlast a few other classes
---
I'm like that with my Alt Mage that I made just for farming.  If you're not passionate about your class then you won't play.
---
Others mentioned it, but try rerolling.
---
Yeah I'm not having issues at 40, but maybe what you're saying happens later on. I also try to stick to quests and mobs 2-3 levels below me because it has less downtime. 
---
And pulling extra doesn't seem too bad to me, seeing as Rogue has like a million tools to help.
---
Frankly, what is she interested in?
---
I don't think that age is going to be as much of a factor as interest. The more interested she is in the class, the more she'll get into it, and the more she plays, the better she'll get.
---
FPS drops are client side not server side, the game renders in your pc.
---
I don't remember what all the other hit gear is, but I'm going 6 piece shadowcraft with devilsaur legs and gloves. Not sure if x2 TERs is better until a few pieces of t1 are obtained since Shadowcraft doesn't offer hit.
---
I literally never said that the point of this post was to contact the other player. I posted this to share my experience with other players. Not sure why you have such a hatred for that.
---
And that's not a valid point on a game designed around a war and fantasy roleplaying? A warrior crushing someone 5 levels lower than them might be all the motivation they need to keep leveling and come tank instances for me
---
Also tag on another 30-45 minutes if:
---
a) you're on a PvP server, because one or more of your party is guaranteed to get picked off before getting to the instance, especially in Blackrock Mountain.
---
b) if you're alliance and you go to Dire Maul, because one or more of your party is guaranteed to be in various parts of Azeroth (usually Winterspring or EPL) when you join the group.
---
Maybe he means rogues...
---
Combat is the best pve spec for rogues until maybe ice crown i think.
---
Sub is fun in pvp tho.
---
Ok, here's your Karma OwO
---
Who?
---
Who wouldn't want an OEB &gt;.&gt;
---
Not even an offspec?
---
Remember, you have 16 debuff slots to share the other 39 people.
---
PvE server problems. Resource scarcity means good pvp in the overworld.
---
copypasta.
---
Herb/skinning.
---
But absolutely stomps in PvP, good for farming too. A lock that doesnt PvP is missing out on an insanely powerful class. Also it looks cool as shit.
---
Sorry if you need it spelled out to you 5% chance for an extra attack on your MH that can proc off of all your instant/mh/oh attacks is massively better than a random stun.
---
We were discussing the addon in guild last night. Seems like it exists on retail but not for classic.
---
Haven't seen that one before. Is it some pve pvp hybrid?
---
Can we get updated info about horde/alliance balance per server somewhere?
---
Holy fuck thank you thank you. I opened a pair of tickets for this with no answer.
---
Besides the woosh, is an optimized baron run really an hour? That seems absurdly slow.
---
Because red is dead
---
I kill everything thats red on the way to whereever im headed. I don't corpsecamp though, that shit is boring AF.
---
I too would love for this sub so be yet another low effort meme/art dump
---
Venereal disease. The Lion's Pride has a reputation lol
---
Damage for raiding?
---
That makes you probably the smartest healer on all of reddit.
---
If you are ever in a sticky situation and your stealth is on cooldown, think of shadowmeld as a second stealth but keeps you stationary, then when your stealth does come up off cooldown, you can just stealth out of the shadowmeld.
---
Fury warrior with pre raid bis far surpasses every other class for dps. I have full pre raid bis on my rogue and they still do more dps. Resto Shammy, Hunter, rogue, rogue, warrior is the group comp i see for melee dps a lot. Its very good for fast clears and if your out dpsing rogues and warriors with WF and trueshot you should find a new guild or talk to your guild about it because thats very bad. Not that hunters do low dps, but rogues and warriors just do more.
---
Run DM west or strat UD for distracting dagger or bonescraper. That 5% crit talent is a waste on sword OH
---
If only you could block it from appearing in your chat though.
---
Who the fuck designed the chicken escort quest in Tanaris?
---
For even more fun, the one time where I almost succeeded a lvl 60 warrior decides to kill me
---
Go combat daggers, combat sword is dogshit to anything besides raiding.
---
Make a shortcut to the game executable.
---
Did you not see the post I was responding to? That's the whole fucking point.
---
true, but i kinda want it now, i just ended up joining a guild run who let me buy it for 300g (if it rolls)
---
Eagle = leveling
---
Damage = end game
---
&gt; The fact that UBRS is not a 5 man
---
Sure it is, at least up to Rend.
---
My guild has a dagger rogue that usually outperforms our sword rogues.
---
Not sure but I'm having a blast with it, give it a shot and see how you like it though, go back some people and see how you like the feel of the build. I like it for farming too because the ambush crit will do about 50% of the month health of you can chain the kills together
---
Join a guild be consistent get loot
---
No, it's just Brandolini's principle in action. You're begging a lot of questions, but they're easy to address.
---
Uninstall and try again. Had similar issue.
---
Make sure you delete the saved variable files too
---
I wish the "block chat invites" also had a sub checkmark to "automatically report" too. This channel spam is really obnoxious.
---
Are free accounts able to make and invite people to chat channels?
---
It didn't seem like an FPS drop, the server ping skyrocketed to over 2000MS.
---
You think a few tier pieces will cause OP to fall behind in dps? For mages there is not a single T1 piece better than pre raid BIS. What a ridiculous statement.
---
Mobs having less armor would theoretically make BRE even better, since the more armor you have, the less the % physical damage reduction is.
---
In other words, reducing mob armor from 4k to 2k instead of 10k to 8k thanks to BRE is gonna increase your damage MUCH more in the first case
---
I was referring to the post I replied to about rolling on upgrades not the ops specific example
---
30-50 seems to be 75/25 dungeons/questing. Try moving zones too, get questie, it shows you everywhere you have a quest within a given level from your own.
---
Sweet. Cheers can I search it or need an inv?
---
I leveled as a prot pally.
---
Dark Souls was the strip club that paid you to get lap dances in comparison.
---
Two nights ago a horde seven levels up kept ganking me while I was fishing in Hillsbrad. I stopped fishing and started camping some low level horde in a different part of hillsbrad for a few kills. 
---
What this accomplished: my victims I‚Äôm sure cried on local defense that a high level of unknown level was ganking them. This either scares off the guy that ganked me because he thinks some high level showed up, or he left my fishing spot to come help the horde lowbies. Either way after ganking lower levels for a few minutes my fishing spot was empty and I fished unbothered for the rest of the night. 
---
And it let out frustration. RED IS DEAD! AHAB!
---
Yeah. Youre in a 40 man raid. Those are two very rare drops. To have them both on 1 person likely puts you in a very elite group of players, usually reserved for the extremely lucky or loot council favorites.
---
I just find it hard to believe because it's a single faction class...
---
O thanks 0w0
---
Then get Guild members to help you and don't flood LFG.
---
People wanted the original vanilla experience. Well, guess what ... addons existed in vanilla, and pretty much every non-casual player used them back then. I certainly did.
---
Addons are not cheating because the game was designed by Blizzard to support them. Any addons the company considers to be cheats or otherwise 'undesirable' get shut down pretty quick. For example, the LFG addons in Classic.
---
Oh then thats a server thing for sure.
---
Copypasta.
---
should auto report
---
Apes on suicidewatch
---
Didn't know they increased that - ty for that info. Still, in a 40 man raid that can fill up fast.
---
On the other hand I have a job and family and love logging on knowing there is danger around every corner. And while I'm out leveling I might get into a skirmish with and enemy player. I might win, I might lose. Either way I got to play my character and experience what WoW has to offer.
---
The other day I only had about 40 mins to play so I started questing but ran into a hunter on the same quest with limited mobs. We fought and killed each other 4 times. Then I had to log off and I was totally satisfied with that. 
---
We are at war. This isnt a solo rpg
---
This is my point, well put.  Warriors/Rogues with WF can easily put out 600+ DPS, while Hunters are pretty much capped right around 450-500 DPS.  Hunters still put out respectable DPS but windfury just puts it over the top for melee dps.  
---
If you legitimately are out-dpsing all the melee in your guild, you really should be asking the GM/Officers what the deal is.  It just shouldnt be happening.
---
I lead raids in Vanilla for four different guilds over more than a year.  I only ever got the Eye for my Benediction.
---
Don't go into MC/Ony expecting loot; you probably won't get any.
---
Nope, you are wasting your time and the GM's time that would tell you no
---
Despite the overwhelming favor shown for hunters, as a hunter leveling up I would recommend against it. Because the pet is not a simple task at the end of day, you need to feed it, train it, and tame specific new pets to learn pet skills. Not to mention arrows in a quiver is a thing. 
---
Warlock is a stronger fit because once you get a voidwalker, it's the same void Walker. And you can wand mobs to death which is actually the ideal way of leveling 
---
Mage and perhaps priests are also good options, due to the simple leveling rotations and self sustainability/simple upkeep.
---
So cloth classes are you better bets I would argue!
---
You can also then do tailoring which doesn't require gathering your mats from nodes.
---
I had imp sap in my sub combat leveling spec, it was great for 3 packs. Sap one, flurry the other 2. Get group invites because of imp sap. Get kicked from group because of not being pve/raid spec.
---
Gotta group up with friends that know what they are doing and you can clear everything.
---
Also, there's a split second between regular sap and mob aggro. If you time it right, you won't get hit by anything and the tank will have threat.
---
why tf u need 52 keybinds?
---
Just hit 32 on my warrior. Is my highest xp/hr going to be running SM:GY ad nauseam?
---
I can tank as needed, but not sure if I‚Äôll be able to find a group to chain run. I‚Äôm at like 30k/hr just questing.
---
I'm horde, and I'm not gunna lie - I'm racist against gnome warlocks. If I see one, it must die, no matter how low their level, or how dishonorable the kill. Their dumb little bodies and disgusting craft - it's not ok.
---
Doesn't that only have 3 charges?
---
Yeah, had to do those before DM released. Gl
---
What's wrong with rogues D:
---
A bunch of eastern european cyber gangsters funded by gold sellers
---
Thank you!!!
---
I like the loot council system when they let multiple people roll on an item that they deem it should go to. Not the loot council that picks 1 person out of 40 to get a piece of loot
---
Well.  You cared.  Enough to comment.
---
It's actually possible, but the inactive account has to meet pretty strict criteria before they flag it for a name change
---
The games been out 2 months. How do you figure that?
---
I am having a similar experience but it‚Äôs because I now have most of my BIS gear for this tier and the only thing I need from Molten Core is really the Mageblade.
---
I log in every day to farm a few herbs and buy a few of the items I‚Äôm stocking but once Phase2 starts the honor grind begins and I‚Äôm gonna be back in it deep deep.
---
Also, pretty sure swords in fine for PvP just watched the duel tourney
---
You tell me
---
friend sold that for 950g xD, you make your money back in 2 months with this pattern.
---
Made a Hunter named "Beastiiality." How long till Blizzard forces me to name change?

Yeah, my raid group thought it was about to crash because after the crazy ping spike everyone literally froze for close to 30 seconds as you would when you get dconned.
---
Make an alt, play the other fraction tons of other things that can be done instead of racing for the finish line.
---
Share a link to this knowledge?
---
Yeah, I get all that. The question is : WHY is those specific things fun ?
---
I didn't until playing Classic for three weeks, haha.  "BiS" didn't exist back when I played 15 years ago.  At least not on the servers I was on.
---
Osrs memes &gt; all. still subscribed even though I havent played in a year
---
Stop pugging raids if possible. Find a dedicated raiding guild and it will help you get geared
---
My opinion !  Go disc mainly or whatever buffs your healing / Mana Regen then respec to get shadow form at 40. Rock that until your ready to start end game dungeons. 
---
 I've read alot and will agree as long as you have wand spec and spirit tap it really doesnt matter what you out talent points into from 20-39.
---
Warlock is better for PvP when you have very good lategame items. Mage is better for everything else and has a LOT more quality of life perks
---
Is she the prettiest girl you've ever seen in your life?
---
I think there are a couple categories.
---
1. They want to kill people but no honor system and no bgs makes life boring. These people tend to hang out around BRM. They get to pick and choose pvp, but it still carries risks because it is high traffic. This gets worse as honor is implemented and better after bgs and fewer people are just chilling at the mountain or going there for the 2 dozen quests and 5 instances/raids. If they just chased world pvp you end up calling someone and that is generally less fun. Finally it is often rogues that got bored of pick pocketing and need to blue of steam. Annoying? Sure. Understandable? Sure.
---
2. People who are bored in a location already (outside brd). Waiting for group members or hit an instance cap. Again annoying? Sure understandable? Also sure.
---
3. Just passing through. It is a love tap. Maybe you save them maybe you kill them. Depends on the mood and situation, who doesn't like having power. They remember the help other people have them or the time someone ganked them. It isn't personal it is part of the game in a pvp server. Some people are petty and vindictive. If someone camps a lowbie they put that whole guild on a KOS list. I do it, I know others do it too. It helps target frustration.
---
4. This is my farm back off. Again about when you just want your quests, but they just want the items the mobs drop or those mobs for a quest as well. It is just part of playing on a pvp server.
---
5. Finally the last group. Those that go to contested zones like redridge, ashenvale, hillsbrad, etc. Purely to kill lowbies and camp the whole area. Generally they tend to be below average players. Often not 60, but always in pretty terrible gear regardless of the level. Often using weak specs and spamming poor abilities, while neglecting abilities that provide utility (slows and stuns) in favor of damage. They do the same thing regardless of who they are fighting, what level someone is, what class someone is, etc. The only method of pvp they know only works on lowbies, and even then they can still lose. Get cheap shot by a rogue but just ride away because they don't use crippling. Moonfire spamming druids. Dual wielding warriors. AE spamming mages. You get the point. I mostly just find it pitiful. I understand they are doing it because they literally can't fight people close to their level. The frustration of losing you any of the above mentioned people in their mind is equal to camping lowbies. Regardless of who attacked first (often them) and in what situation. They will happily jump someone killing 2 mobs but cry when the person they jumped returns the favor. Unfortunately in highschool this was most my friends and there is a reason why those individuals ended up in different guilds. They also tended to be those that would be you to do an instance for them or their item and complain about helping you. They felt entitled to gear from raids, but hated doing content after they got their loot and would look to sit as often as possible. The second another boss they need came up they would be to be brought in... Also they need a summon and they don't have consumables for pushing this new boss. If they made groups they would be the last one to arrive. Outside of the game they were generally good people, often helpful. I'm game though they were not fun to play with. And battle grounds were like pulling teeth with them in a pre-made. They couldn't focus objectives, they HAD to be in the group killing people... But they were not good and unwilling to try and improve which meant they lost fights, even if they won no one got the objective. In pugs they saw good groups shove then to the grave yard and thought "I'm there group now their turn to sit in the grave yard" but instead they turned the premade into one that lost quickly to pugs. But it wasn't their fault the other teams healers were better, etc...  In world pvp they will 100% end up getting you dishonorable kills. That is if they ever reach 60. They are also the first to quit. And I get it they need to blow off steam, but good guilds rarely put up with these players crap for long because of everything else, bad guilds perpetuate it. And this is why some guilds had bad reps in vanilla. Every server had the pvp group that was totally going to push to rank 14... But struggled beyond rank 11 and lost to pugs. They would say it was great or time, but really it was just being unwilling to self improve.
---
I absolutely use a farming set. Has dropped my deaths considerably.
---
Looted 3 pieces of the Magisters set in dungeons and bought the belt off the AH, it puts me around 6500 mana and I speccd into an elementalist build to farm ZF GY for my epic mount. Before I had the set I was constantly running out of mana with each pull.  If you do farm ZF GY make sure you pick up the Rune of Dawn to get that +spell power to undead.
---
Well it is called a "Mage"blade, soooooooo...
---
PS: I'm a Mage
---
That would be Opposite Day on my server. Horde are always camping BRM. Allies occasionally clear out the immediate instance entrances but never camp the BRM entrance like that.
---
Bought mine 90g, which I consider a good price. It's pre-raid BiS for healing priest.
---
Everyone says shadow but outside of 5 points into Spirit Tap and Improved Wand for your first 40ish levels you can solo and heal dungeons just fine putting points wherever you want.
---
&gt; Lionheart helm is better than raid gear for warriors.
---
tbf, it's Epic, expensive, and the pattern is rare af.
---
Ha my guild leader tops meters as a dagger rogue. He also brings lots of consumers and knows I‚Äôll hold threat pretty much instantly.
---
I'm thinking of trying the spec frost and some other youtuber have been using that uses 31 frost and master of elements or w.e from the fire tree. Seems very mana efficient and it's basically nova + flamestrike + coc while kiting.
---
All on my server are about 100g. They are listed on many preraid BiS lists.
---
More than that: Barbarous Blade and Peacemaker are totally uncontested drops for Hunters, and Dal'Rends offhand is totally useless on its own for Hunters. I can _almost_ understand a Hunter taking the main hand thinking it's an upgrade, but the offhand alone is an un-disputed downgrade.

---
I think we all know the Mageblade is a hunter weapon. So let's not worry about that.
---
The person or people telling you it's full resto or nothing are terrible.  Nobody is full resto for MC, it's completely unnecessary and wastes tons of gold for respecs.  Find a good guild.
---
Spec into p.o.m.
---
Technically it would be a gang rape because you defiantly couldn‚Äôt do it by yourself.
---
Maybe the premise of "just farming" is what's making it less fun? I'm not telling you what you should think is fun but perhaps if it's feels more like a chore it's harder to motivate? 
---
Maybe perfecting the aoe technique or speed leveling would feel more motivating. Or you just need a break from the game for a bit.
---
Retail is just plain garbage, Its either classic or nothing, if I ever get bored of classic, ill be hopping onto another game, not retail, so annoying that people think classic players will eventually play retail once content dries out, um no, retail is so fucking bad, no way in hell ill ever play that garbage over classic or another completely different game
---
Plus the fact that /r/2007scape is 90% shitposting, and a lot more people love shitposting than screenshots of people getting mounts/hitting 60/finding world epics/etc.
---
At first I was mad about the second mc off of the top chain then I just laughed but still fuck you alliance scum :)
---
TBC, it's not even a thought.
---
Vanilla is straight garbage in comparison.  
---
Worse raid designs.  
---
Worse talent tree designs.  
---
Worse class variety.  
---
Worse pvp (no arenas).  
---
Worse gameplay.  
---
Lower skill cap.  
---
Worse QoL.  
---
Worse class fantasy. (Subjective)
---
What does this comment mean. Paladins are GOAT healers in PvP and druids have the best mobility.
---
As long as you're not using a half dozen green frozen wrath pieces you'll probably be fine
---
Tauren are taller than gnomes! Such humor!
---
New to the game going through the first dungeons. How do I let my party members roll for chest items?
---
It's not done falling
---
The rate of exchange is meaningless unless you also put it in context of buying power.  Let's suppose $8.35 becomes (regardless of the actual rate, this is to demonstrate my point) 835 yuan, but a mcchicken costs 100 yuan (at our pretend rate that's one US dollar) then they're not really better off taking American dollars since it also costs money just to exchange it.
---
You didn't need 2k for shoulders in TBC
---
I'm not sure if im just not seeing it but at 15-18 7. f. you have us grab apothecary zemah but i dont see when  we're turning it in within the 45 minutes? Or am i misunderstanding
---
Mistakes were made but hey, 50g is 50g I guess.
---
Hi. I'm kinda new to classic. And was just looking for a casual class to do PVP with. Something that does not require a lot of gear and is easy to do good with.
---
Finally someone that seems to understand
---
Those of us who canceled our accounts forgot to quit the subreddit.
---
Why not Deviate Delight?  No que, especially when layers drop (idk if they have on Grobb).  Pop. on DD is higher than vanilla servers.  By far a more chill community than Grobb (played both servers).  Guess it doesn't matter much, just food for thought
---
IDK what's sadder. The fact that he wanted the bow or the fact that they gave it to him. He literally replaced carapace spine crossbow with it

No clue about the 60s who sit in low level zones but for me I couldn't care less about how long it takes me to get to 60, itll happen eventually. But BOY if you're alliance and I see you in my zones you're getting camped. I stick to mainly STV and Dustwallow atm so only see people around my level though some could be upwards of 5 below me. We're at war after all. I made life hell for a hunter/lock duo last night in dwm killing them a combined 15 times before I finished my quests and hearthed. Worth every second.
---
Keep trying. I got a Zealot Blade while grinding and tried for 3 days to sell it at the 35g four others were up for with no results. Yesterday morning some guy found time with non on there and put his up for 250g. Took a chance and undercut him by half. Came home to 125g sale after not selling for 35.

Basically Stormwind was burnt down by the Orc's during the first war (when the orc's first came to Azeroth). The Stonemasons guild was hired to rebuild it, and their leader was Edwin Vancleef (the final boss of Deadmines). This meant a bunch of engineers and artisans moved to the area and made a beautiful city. When it was all said and done they never got paid (due to corruption within the Stormwind Nobles and Onyxia's influence).
---
When Vancleef demanded they get paid the nobles striped him of his title, disbanded the masons and pissed off the workers who he represented. This lead to a workers riot and during the course the Queen was accidentally killed by a thrown stone. This pissed off the King (who had refused to pay the workers) and he drove them from the city severely. Those exiled workers became the Defias brotherhood.
---
Yeah I made the mistake of running BRD a couple times before I got the quests and then had to go back when I really didn't need much else. It wasn't nearly as much fun. haha
---
Was thinking about switching to another server, found out a group of friends from the old days are playing...and found out just now it's not possible, any news it might be possible at some point ?
---
Titillating post sorry I‚Äôm not help

---
I really wish I didn't end up on a deadass server. I hope they provide lots of free transfers because this situation really sucks. I assumed it was going to be a big server because it was the one everyone got free xfers to, instead it's garbagio
---
Hunter/mage are both pretty good and level well.
---
Him and I and 75% of the player population.
---
Have you considered the part where Dal'Rends offhand offers literally nothing to a Hunter on its own? It only has value as a completed set, which requires you to have the main hand first.

I was honestly so young that I didn't even buy Wrath right away was just playing my warrior..well spent half of it dying and getting lost. Found out about Wrath through a commercial so i bought the expansions, just never loved outland compared to Northrend, but also because everyone moved on i'm sure I missed plently of the TBC fun and hype. WOW was at its peak number wise so leveling was sooo fun as a noob.
---
Man, one of those heart-pounding, hands-sweaty, heady moments of "OMG OMG OMG SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT WHAAAAT YEEEESSSSSSSSS!!!!!"
---
I'm saying that you're talking about human interaction, not the game. You're going to have to convince players what to do, not the game.
---
&gt;I agree that there are more warriors that want to tank than there are tank spots in a raid
---
Right. It used to be that people were often forced to be tanks in raiding guilds. A lot of Warriors wanted to roll on 2H items. Therefore people who tanked were also allowed to roll on some stuff. But this was when the game was tougher.
---
Now, you don't have that leverage. It's not like you can convince people to let you tank *and* get other stuff. Depends on the guild.
---
Consider a 5-man party. If a 5-man can't find a tank, but you're willing to tank, but you tell them you also want to roll on DPS plate or whatever, then that means they aren't in a position to refuse so easily. If they can easily find another tank, then you won't get invited. Simple as that.
---
Presence of mind will allow you to insta cast flame strike
---
RED MAKES IT GO FASTAH
---
To be fair, most 'average' guilds aren't doing the things described.
---
Ya they're doing weekly MC runs and all, but they were still leveling up, like basically all of us, when APES did their thing.
---
The gear available now, with its adjusted stats and all, is already basically a hyper crutch for T1.  There's no need to keep going, unless you want raids to be essentially pointless due to no one actually wanting to go for item drops.
---
/cast [@cursor] flamestrike
---
Na always innervate the rogues and warriors or other druids just as they pop their one
---
Locks deal with aids shards but have waayy less competition
---
I've been leveling almost exclusively as Prot and I've had no issues with threat. You have plenty of tools at your disposal in order to keep threat as a warrior. As long as you play your class right, you should have no issues holding threat until you're endgame raiding in phase 3.
---
Have everyone type /roll and highest wins everything in the chest
---
But the point still stands, You gear towards 1 role for example healing. Only in guild groups will you be pushing gear if you are pushing mana builds.(Not with randoms as this group was) Otherwise you could literally sherik out mid run you are gonna need on everything for DE. That's not fucking teamplay.
---
Yes if your needing on shit for a PvP patch that isn't out you are a piece of shit. You personally might want to justify but the decent raiders with a brain won't. Seems you just want to take shit for whatever reason you find so i see no real reason in arguing with you.
---
Downfall of DKP right there. You guys DE'ing tier gear?
---
Why is it a tilting post?
---
Is it though? There is a +55 healing green.
---
Kk ty
---
i know but i'm saying even if it's just a pug i think it's still rude to roll on whatever you want just because it's an upgrade if other players can get far more use out of it. like i said if i played hunter i wouldn't take dalrend's over a rogue or warrior even in the phase where they are pre-bis.
---
Id say try dm aswell. ST isnt for the gold. Only for the offhand.
---
Gun for dwarf, bow for troll. Rest don‚Äôt matter.
---
Also your consistent viewpoint is being proven wrong by a majotity if people saying they want bc in this thread.
---
Only two dps warriors...my dream. But yeah, hunters really aren't gonna beat warriors or rogues...ever. However, if the warriors are trying 2h with bad weapons or rogues are not hit capped, maybe he's besting them.
---
The hanter will want to use a slingshot, a hunter will want whichever weapon is the slowest
---
If it worked the way it was intended, sure keep it. It's breaking a ton of shit, though just so that mages can sheep each other.
---
swords can be fantastic in pvp if you use hemo. if you use your pve spec in pvp then yeah, not so much.
---
what makes you think gay people cant be bankers.... bigot.
---
I don't know the stats, I'm only going by the assumption that it was an upgrade as OP said.
---
Speak for yourself.
---
Where in Azshara are people getting Essence of Water?
---
So, because *you* help the opposite faction, you fail to understand why others dont? And kill? This makes no sense.
---
I imagine it'll be pretty far down the road, so I'd get to leveling an alt.
---
You can kill all of the minibosses as a 60 feral druid, they're not hard.
---
MC'ing people off the boat is my favorite. 
---
That and just following low level alliance players around on the boat as they try to stay out of your line of sight.
---
I'm in denial because by that point the trash at the start is grey.
---
In addition to hunter/mage, shadow priest is a decent option as well for what you're looking for.
---
Make a lvl 5 alt, get enchanting. You can DE items of any level as soon as you learn enchanting.
---
Hunters want the leaf. If you aren't allowed to get the leaf, run with another group.
---
Striker's Mark sometimes doesn't go to hunters because it gears the whole raid faster that way (it's bis for non-hunters and not bis for hunters).
---
Ok i think this is what i needed to see written. Id just hate to respec now since im close to getting my mount haha. What lvl is the flurry ability obtained at?
---
Ha, most of the escort quests are aids. If you can get a group great, but they're typically very hard to solo.  As someone else posted, if you want the pet or something they give come back over leveled perhaps.
---
Because you said like the tittle says
---
I'm in my 30s and I play wow as a hobby. 
---
I don't go to parties.

#`[player] HAS BEEN YOTE FROM THE INSTANCE!`
---
It's not true, last week the leaf dropped and all the raid hunters had it, we called in a lvl 57 from IF to get it.
---
No, the point is you are saying release bc but change it so vanilla core kept alive. You can have bc or you can have vanilla core kept alive, but not both. Given the commercial success of bc vs vanila subscriptions and the massive difference of work effort i can tell you that bc with no changes is gonna be released if they release any bc content.
---
6 full MC runs and 0 loot so far.
---
In BFA I saw alliance-balance-druid-bots farming in Zandalar in this pit while I was doing my story quests.
---
My server has a guy named hideandseek that has all types of gambling games. He's legit too.
---
it's not a song
---
But passing on gear!
---
I am, not saying you couldn't hold aggro against the scrubs in greens. Read again. I said you won't hold aggro with arms over geared DPS players.
---
If its only viable for holding aggro over trash DPS, its not viable.
---
The reason for your deaths is irrelevant. The fact that you think that dying countless times in MC is evidence of a spec working well is just ridiculous.
---
Tanks need to do two things. Stay alive and hold aggro. Whether it was the spec or not, you didnt stay alive in MC. So you can't use that as an example of good or viable tanking. You also won't hold aggro over good DPS.
---
Viable : capable of working successfully; feasible.
---
It is not capable of holding aggro over geared players. It is not capable of working successfully. It is not viable.
---
Arms is 100% the worst spec for tanking. You want to go tell people that it is viable fine. But so is tanking without spending talent points then. You really aren't making much of a point here.
---
My experience of playing in game and spending time on these forums is less prone to sampling bias than a single thread that is titled favourably towards TBC being released.
---
Definitely could refer to it as Anecdotal though. Also my original post can also be read "Most people who" which is less unreasonable.
---
[uhhhh](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20742924694)
---
Thank you for your great reply. Makes sense and didn‚Äôt think too much about the gear.
---
Based on some of your other comments, it seems like you're new to WoW. I haven't seen anyone talk about your gear yet, so that's what I'm going to point out. In general, Arms relies heavily on your WEAPON itself, while Fury relies on you ATTACK POWER for damage. These stats come from your gear, specifically.
---
The reason why warriors and rogues have a slower leveling speeds is because your gear will always lag behind your level. The only time you will realistically have level-appropriate gear is at level 60 , and that's only because you literally can't out level your gear anymore. Spell casters rely on base spell damage for most of the time they are leveling, so having out-dated gear isn't as prohibitive for them.
---
Attack power comes from strength and strength will be spread out across all of your gear. You will get incremental upgrades far more often. If you have a poor or outdated weapon, or you have a weapon that is faster (say, sub 3.0 weapon speed, thus a lower damage range), that is going to affect your damage as arms way more than your damage as fury - leveling as 2H fury is just fine!
---
A lot of the arms talents scale very well. +crit DAMAGE (impale / deep wounds) is very stong... assuming you have a lot crit... which you don't, because you are still leveling. +5% weapon damage can be useful... if you have a strong weapon... which you don't, because you are still leveling - even if you find one, you will out level it sooner or later. Mortal strike is very strong... if you have a strong, slow weapon...  you see where I'm going with this.
---
On the other hand, fury talents will help you regardless of weapon. Both battle shout talents are great for leveling. Flurry is nice. Bloodthirst doesn't rely on having a strong, slow weapon. Both bloodthirst and frenzy(blood craze? I don't remember the name - the talent that procs when you get crit, it leads to flurry) have a SELF HEAL, which is constantly undervalued while leveling, imo. If you can fit in 1 extra mob between eating / bandaging, that will compound over time. Also, that new 2.7 speed 2H mace you found? Totally fine with fury, not so much with arms. For this reason, I would say fury is 'smoother' than arms for leveling. 
---
The earliest point I would recommend going arms is 45. That way you can get Mortal strike, deep wounds, impale, 5% crit from axe spec AND 5% crit from fury tree. At that point you need to be concentration on finding the strongest, slowest axe you can find. you will probably be like 15-20% crit at that point.
---
If you want really want to learn, read about HOW rage is generated, why heroic strike isn't very good, what the 'attack table' is, and why +hit is important (and why dual-wielding without +hit gear can feel underwhelming, especially while leveling)
---

Yeah, it's hard to factor in Stamina to "bis" gear, not to mention it's probably smart to give up some of your +healing for spirit.
---
No but her ass is as big as a gnome
---
You can see it in the screenshot...
---
I'm sorry :( I failed

and possibly pvp stun trinket or eng items
---
Once you‚Äôve gotten the best blues your better off spending time in MC for a slim chance of an upgrade versus not raiding imo.

How's faction balance?

Faerlina Horde and I get them once every three or so days. Not sure of a pattern but if they send me an invite I insta ignore so maybe they're running out of accounts to invite me on? Hahah

Ran into a female paladin with the same name as my ex girlfriend the other day
---
Kept running into her for the next two hours while I fished deviates, man that sucked
---
This deserves its own post. Would be well needed for a lot of people to hear.
---
I agree lots of people think of guilds the wrong way. It supposed to be a social community helping eachother and progressing together regardless if you have full tier set or are just a fresh 60. 
---
Everyone is so focused on getting loot they are forgetting the MMO part of the MMORPG.
---
&gt; Is there a reason not to tank with a dagger?
---
Bosses have 14% parry. Whether or not increased potential boss hits (due to parry) in any given window of time matters or not depends on your healers (and it matters a hell of a lot more the less mana they have to spare at the time any parry may occur).
---
If you've ever leveled with a (slow) 2hander weapon and then chain parried a mob (and subsequently seen their health melt) you should be fully aware of the difference it can make (and it is definitely not fun to be on the receiving end).
---
Ha! I'm nearly 43! n00b!1!!1!1
---
Of course I was learning the game and leveling a prot warrior (for 25 of those levels).
---
Both of our druids are like 6/8 T1 as well
---
Well then, lets examine this viewpoint.
---
Lets say Warden Staff drops (bis druid tanking weapon even after clearing Naxx). Would it be ok for a feral druid to need on it eventho it sells for a couple hundred gold on the AH?
---
I would say yes. 
---
Would i be ok with the person needing it even if tanking was an offspec?
---
I would say yes.
---
Would i be ok with him needing it for a friend/spouse?
---
Here it becomes a matter of trust. If this guy seems like the kind of person who cant be trusted or if he has been rolling need on a whole lot of stuff for weird reasons then i would probably say no he cant. But im trying to give people the benefit of the doubt, so if he has been a decent player and i have enjoyed playing with him and he does not seem like a liar - then sure i would let him need on it for his friend/wife.
---
All 3 of these cases the person (or his friend/spouse) would have to buy the item on the AH. In two of the cases its the person in the group who needs it. And i honestly dont think that "but i can make gold by selling it on the AH, why should i let you have it?" is a good argument.
---
I feel like it was too.. it may have been changed with P5/.5 Dungeon set release?
---
Design choices like that exist to enable LFR. If no class brings any special utility beyond their role (healer, dps, tank), LFR can just blindly group those roles in the correct proportions and be successful.
---
Weak compared to priests? Our shamans are always top healers by far with zero competition from priests. And all our priests are full geared Bene priests stop with the nonsense that shamans are weak. ( I‚Äôm a priest )
---
I actually baited him into silencing my fire spells instead of frost by using scorch üòÄ.
---
Did something similar last night, was chatting with our other druid while raiding MC about how much we need cenarion bracers. Lo and behold they dropped a couple bosses in and I won, securing my 5 set bonus :)
---
Dropped in the run. 
---
People in the run that will use it should have prio over people in the run that just want to sell it. It‚Äôs why there is a need/greed/pass system. If they shouldn‚Äôt have prio it would just be Roll/Pass.
---
This is the truth laid bare.
---
Equivalently annoying are the freshers who expect a raid spot. "Heads-up guys, I've arrived! I finally hit 60 and got my attunes! So, which of the people you've been raiding with the last couple of months are you kicking to make a spot for me? Invite. Invite! INVITE!!11!!"
---
Okay, yeah, we were sloppy while leveling and over-recruited. Sorry about that; now please go find a new guild that needs yet another rando mage.
---
Tbh it's better that he stole the offhand, as long as he doesn't roll on the MH it probably doesn't slow down anyone considerably on getting their set. It would be worse to take the MH. At least now he can get educated and farm the right gear.
---
Is the recipe really that valuable i dont understand I see people crafting them for free if you provide the mats
---
So your saying there's a chance....
---
Those kids who don‚Äôt finish their stew better watch tf out
---
That settles it. I'm rolling a druid alt.
---
the worst horde city
---
Right, which is why I don't want BC. Any of it.
---
If doesn't already have a Bizznick's scope on his gun, he should get one of those for Rhok anyways, which would be the 3% hit he needs back.
---
Lol!! You summed up my entire thought process that whole fight.
---
Second this lol
---
It's kind of a hassle for horde to stinkbomb the place. Add a horde you will get attacked several times trying to throw stink bombs.
---
You take a big hit to exp but you'd be shocked how much extra power 1 additional person provides the team. Through some poor planning we ended up 6 manning LBRS (our druid was feral specced, not healing so we invited a guild priest). LBRS was an absolutely faceroll with 6 people. It was non-stop pull, smackdown, repeat.
---
Sure, there's less loot to distribute around, but sometimes it's fun to get with your buddies and just roflstomp a dungeon.
---
I like the ally cities because of how Tolkien-esque they feel; Stormwind being essentially Minas Tirith, IF being somewhat like Moria/Erebor, and even Darnassus having a very Rivendell/Lothlorien feel to it.
---
It comes and goes... I've done 3x MC and 2x Ony and well... I have t2 helm and ony head, and shoulders and cloak from MC -- but my wife has nothing so far in the same raids... it's all down to some luck
---
Rune of the guard captain is not pre-raid best in slot.
---
HoJ + BHB is pre-bis
---
RotGC is an excellent 3rd voice but it's not related to best in slot
---
Same is true here
---
I support this.
---
  - signed, Purple Mage
---
The alliance are imperialist slavers and incredibly racist and I will kill every last one I encounter in honor of my Warchief.
---
Sounds wrong to me.
---
Nope. No remorse. That is the banner I swore to protect.
---
My guild has a dagger rogue with core hound tooth that seems to do negative damage in raids. I cant understand how his dps is regularly half of other rogues with non preraid BIS weapons.
---
Soul shards are bad enough, at least as a warlock I don't have to carry 2 gear sets!
---
 WRONG. I was sorely mistaken....  Instead of having dps / heal / tank gear, I instead have dps / more dps gear lol. Basically a "Stats set" which focuses on stamina for when I'm out in the world, and a shadow dmg set for dungeons / group content.
---
Why not even bid like 1 dkp?
---
I started seeing winter squid fishing at Raventusk, skill was ~140 but you can use bobbles to hit the 205 requirement. 
---
There are fishing guides out there that will answer all your questions, no need to copy paste them here.

Dire maul hallway
---
Be rogue, realize the competition is way too high, cry
---
Hope I can get my rogue 1-60 before P2 but regardless I will be rolling in a five man at all times when on my warrior
---
Probably will make a new post but can you get rank 10 after the first week, buy all the gear and be done with it? Cuz 1st week everyone will be like wtf and if you know what youre doing getting a higher rank will be easier?
---
Is this based on private servers?  In vanilla I got to rank 11 or 12 solo before giving up and I absolutely did not play that much.
---
You really think having 20 or so less points in the Resto tree isn't a big deal??
---
The same logic could be applied to you all joining their guild.
---
Nothing wrong with you getting 2 excellent items
---
Spy only shows what's in the combat log in a more visual way.  Same as weak auras really.  Never get why ppl.hate on it so much
---
In vanilla Hunter was the go to class for everyone who wanted the easiest time possible.
---
As others have said, Paladin is also a very easy class as long as you're not doing dungeon and raid at or close to lvl 60 since you'll be asked to be a healer.
---
No those ONLY come from killing NPC's
---
Yea I think so, I guess barrens got ratchet.
---
since you are a bear, a macro to be able to use health potions seems like a big deal
---
I remember doing Rank 11 solo, just doing AV regularly every day after work when i was younger.
---
For raiding: Maximize spellpower (but prioritize hit) and use mana pots, mana gems etc to offset missing mana.
---
Good idea, but we have Retail for that.
---
Classic+ this has been discussed to death. 
---
A lot of people like the idea. Most people think we will get BC/Wrath Classic because it‚Äôs a layup for Blizzard.
---
I mean, we don't know her side of the story.
---
Nope, did not say that at all.
---
I am not sure about FRD. It may scale with spell power. But I have no data, unfortunately.
---
It didn't even do anything up until an update or two ago.  Definitely a work in progress.
---
Tbh, I just made my buffs show up on the frames for each person, and check who has what that way.
---
I use it with evasion when I pull agg from the tank, it happens are a bit as the ambush crits are 1300+ at times and my crit chance for regular hits is over 25% that puts me at 85 or so dodge chance while both are active
---
You an orc as well?
---
If I tell you that we did eventually complete MC, but could never get past the first boss in black wing lair and that ultimately broke the guild into pieces, you would probably have less doubt:)
---
Curse of exhaustion and kite with siphon life, corruption, and nightfall procs.
---
It's gonna be "interesting" for those new to the game just getting into BRD for the first time in phase 2 lol.
---
Because people like him never outline exactly what they mean.
---
What is TBC with classic gameplay? You can't just say something that vague when everyone that wants TBC can affirmatively spell out exactly what parts of TBC they look forward to.
---
All I heard are ridiculous notions like just keeping everything the same but spending resources to roll out new zones. (Are they that naive to think no gameplay will change if they roll out new zones? Blizzard isn't going to release an EPL 2.0 inside Ghostlands that doesn't change gameplay.)
---
I would do a few runs of scholo and strath ud. They both drop pieces of good stam int gear (make sure to grab blood of the martyr from the strath quest).
---
Biggest true of classic.
---
Well, the only argument I have against that is that we have more people we bring to the raid. But that's not exactly the strongest argument, haha. I'll give you this one :P
---
I only use Ghostly Strike in pve when I'm questing. After I hit 60, probably won't have much of a use for it in raids or pvp
---
No need, seems plenty are already doing it.
---
If you are doing it right you shouldn't have any downtime at all. I literally can kill mobs non stop without having to ever drink.
---
I took a couple week break. It's a game man. If you arent havin fun dont play. It's not goin anywhere.
---
&gt; Horde is for chill people
---
&gt; Proceeds to post cringey response bashing Alliance
---
I looked into it and a few different sources say different things, but the example and blue post [here](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_table) both suggest it's the same for yellow (melee) damage.
---
I see. Thanks for your answer.
---
Imo flying destroy most mmos. Obviously not swtor;) but in swtor one still cannot fly on the planets themselves and I believe that is part of why it‚Äôs not dead yet.
---
Well, at least better a warlock than the healing priest who got it my last run.
---
No problem, it wasn't fully clear. And we'll leave that discussion for another time ;)
---
Thank you! :D
---
Training tanks for a boss that‚Äôs 2 years away on trash that doesn‚Äôt translate in any way. Nice.
---
Staff of dominance
---
Ultimately anyone who sees raiding solely in terms of ‚Äúhow much gear will I get‚Äù is almost guaranteed to get frustrated and burnt out in classic.
---
Having a tight nit, consistent raid group who have been levelling together and who get genuine satisfaction out of gearing up the raid as a whole will have a LOT more fun. RNG is going kick you in the teeth on some items, but someone in the raid will always be getting gear, so if you get enjoyment out of that you will be happier playing overall.
---
DONT KNOW WHATS GOING ON, BUT I ADVIZE SLAP IN FACE WITH BIG METAL
---
The feels when a girl named Cassie also broke my heart when I was younger.
---
I think there is also a level requirement, like they have to be under a certain level and only after x years does level not matter any more
---
How did the wish list affect loot distrabution?
---
well played, pretty sad he couldn't kill you with a mob on you
---
When world bosses are released the outrage will be even greater, increasing the pressure on Blizz.
---
I just made a paladin to play with my gf on alliance. What is the ideal spec to use? And does anyone have a link?
---
I made this video because i wanted to give something back to this amazing community and share some of my experience after maining a hunter since i was 10 years old during Vanilla! I tried to have fun, be a little funny, but also be educational! Thanks for watching:D
---
I was peacefully mining in Thousand Needles the other day. A 5-man of gnomes ran up to me. Spammed me with CC, taking turns to take the Vein, and spamming dance and bowing. Then they bowed together and ran off while spamming /wave.
---
A group of gnomes yoinked a Vein. With so much effort they could've done anything, but they chose this.
---
I wasn't even mad. It was hilarious, so I just waved back, trying to process what the f___ even went down there.
---
Victory in world PvP and battlegrounds could be determined by who has healers. Healers make-or-break teams in battlegrounds. Don't worry about how many kills you can achieve on your own - focus on the bigger picture and support aspect. I'm gonna help win many battlegrounds on my holy priest :)
---
Leave your existing character logged off until raid time.
---
Play what you enjoy.
---
Details and Classic Threat.
---
Looks like a Sontaran from Dr Who.
---
Ive done that with fireball but i probably should use scorch instead
---
Yes, PvP gear has zero use until Phase 2 or 3.  I'm on a PvP server and have zero use for PvP gear.
---
Teamplay is understanding that BiS is not the only thing that matters.  A 54 in quest greens rolling on a 54 item that is BiS for someone else is a huge upgrade while a marginal sidegrade for the 60.  And if the 60 wants the item, they should reserve the item ahead of time.  If you want BiS to be an auto reserve, say it at the beginning or before the run or fuck off.
---
They certainly help, but as a Priest healer, they're the equivalent of a Greater Heal or ~600 mana. I'd rather use Superior Mana Potions, as they're much cheaper.
---
Not a hunter but I do have a point about guns;)
---
As a tank I often pull using a gun. And I believe the sound of a gun would sort of alert my group that I have just pulled. Since gun sounds ain‚Äôt that common from mobs.
---
Defense is an okish stat for mitigation
---
Pressing shield block on cd makes you immune to 99% of all crits. Most bosses also don't hit hard physically rn.
---
Don't ever gear for defense unless you're tanking patchwork or saphiron
---
Our hunters are full t1 with t2 helms. Rogues are about halfway geared in tier gear. Rdruids are geared. Locks are geared in mostly t1 now. I'm a druid tank and I've only got 2 epics, but there's only 6 total and I get my 3rd next week (ony necklace).
---
But isn‚Äôt that just retail?
---
holy shit you hit the nail on the head. This is how I feel in my guild and I'm only a member ( i do not want to be an officer or anything more than just a spriest who plays) There's maybe 10 of us who constantly run things daily, 10 more who join when they are on but not quite as often, then 20 who just show up  and fill bodies. Most of which are dragging along not performing as good as they should. Loot council comes out and they get so mad when they don't get loot. 
---
 I honestly cannot wait for ZG and AQ20 when my 20 man is arguing about whose going to get the loot because noone wants to sound greedy. It's going to be a lot of well I don't think I should get this piece, and we have a lot of roll offs. The core group is so close we want everyone to be evenly geared and have fun.
---
Well Im wondering what class is most competitor on the Need rolls leveling up so it makes sense to run myself through the dungeons versus having to rerun deadmines or whatever 20 times to get something that benefits my class.
---
Defectors cannot be tolerated. Another name to the KOS list.
---
The 40 vs 39 dps is without incouding the increase dmg during AR or how it affects the main hand.
---
Look, you read a guide somewhere that said +5 dmg is the best and you want to defend it.  That's cool and I qualified the hell out of everything I said, but you are the one who doesn't actually know what you are talking about.  Crusader ends up being a higher average dps even when accounting for the chance of procing over itself and also the misses which lower the proc rate.
---
You can accept it or not.  You can sit back and accept that buying the mats for something that is maybe a .5-1dps upgrade isn't worht it, but you have to accept it.  I would gladly love to see your support for why you are right, but you don't have it because your information came from some guide you read which once against didn't support itself either.
---
Don't spread nonsense you can't support at all and call out people who can actually support their case.
---
Yes, zf has some very annoying spots with fake walls.
---
Flying came out in TBC.    
---
LFG in TBC did 2 things: (auto-spammed the same message you would spam manually. Auto-invited people that were of the appropriate level iirc.) It was literally a visual representation of the LFG spam in Vanilla.  
---
LFR came out after TBC.  
---
Dungeon finder came out after TBC.  
---
Cross realms happened in Classic (BGs)  
---
Cross realms happened after TBC (LFR/LFG, because those tools didn't even exist in TBC.)
---
Unless you post a recording of the run we OBVIOUSLY can't say. This reeks of Karma whoring.
---
I simply do not do escort quests.
---
I envy you then. The current guild I‚Äôm in picks 1 person to get the item based off reasonable factors (performance, attendance, previous items, etc..) but many cases have multiple people in the same situation and they just chose 1 person. The others don‚Äôt get a chance.
---
Linear progression raiding instead of nullifying older content (Itemization rework likely required), class reworks that don't move towards samifying everything but try(tm) to keep assymetrical balancing alive, less attempts at smoothing out both gameplay/itemization/socialization that leads down the path of NPC-ifying other players and making the world feel like a perfect artificially manicured garden instead of a forest.
---
I'm not going to argue my positions on each of these things, it's more nuanced than I have time for right now, but there are lots of meaty topics of discussion. Basically the arguments for vanilla existing at all apply, but it gets a lot more complicated since we're talking about something other than "copy what was old".
---
We know the loot tables, and for classic, your bis or pre bis will generally be some specific bows and crossbows. Purely because of DPS, slow weapon speed, and other stats. (Unfortunately also true for dwarf.. obv true for troll.)

---
I agree with your point about flying mounts but disagree with your distaste for the outlands in general.  I loved outlands.
---
you don't see shit, you have no idea what happened other than what the OP claims. hell it could have been set up to troll all you people(which has happened before)
---
And the worst part is after posting this I made it better.  Mods can you swap the new one in for the old one?  I don't want to repost.
---
I don't even play wow currently but I love to brows this sub.
---
Seems unlikely you'd be able to get it that quick without BGs.
---
I mean... not everything needs to be min/max'd to the extreme.  I'll still be doing more dps than the Boomkin in our raid.
---
I  believe the level zones dictate the fishing level required to successfully fish out of pools.  I believe for Winter Squid that requirement is level 35, so fishing level of \~200.   Yes it will be seasonal however.  
---
Yes, some fish are on that rotation - do a quick google search and you'll find the comprehensive list.  Yes, you can still catch Winter Squid all day long, however I believe the certain catch timing is nighttime.  Some fish can ONLY be caught during their correct time.
---
As a 40 something priest, I got one stinkbomb off before being mobbed by guards.  You have to be in the middle of the town and without a raid to support you, you may not be able to get a cast off before guards murder you.  It's just not worth your time at a lower level.
---
That doesnt answer the question of the OP nor does it add anything relevant. My response is to his question of "why and what satisfaction do you get from it?" You clearly seem to have the mentality of someone that I described, which I used to be and had spent countless *days* of playtime doing up until maybe the past 3-5 years of me playing. I also have the foresight to park my main in areas that are highly contested or resorting to logging onto an alt for a few minutes until the griefers move on.
---
 Yes, it's a pvp server and these things happen. I refuse to play on a pve server because j would not want to live in an azeroth where this *cant* happen. But why do people continuously gank people 40 levels below them? They do it because being an asshole is fun for some. And yeah, sometimes it is fun. Most of the time though you have to sit back and realize that it's another person on the other end and maybe they really just want to relax and play and have fun. You can surely find someone your own size to pick on.
---
So again, in response to OP, why gank people 40 levels below you? *because being an asshole can be fun for some.* it's really that simple and nothing to get worked up about.
---
BRM during raid days (bring sapper charges and a few friends), Southshore vs Tarren mill is a classic, LHC in EPL (no guards)
---
Considering you‚Äôre lucky if you get 2-3 to drop in one run, it‚Äôs not that unreasonable to do. They‚Äôre looking for a healer that‚Äôs there for gear, not for orbs for a crusader enchant they don‚Äôt want. 
---
If you don‚Äôt like it, don‚Äôt ever join the groups and move on.
---
My guy
---
Maybe she was a gnome priest who was using mind control.
---
It's not about getting the bags for yourself, it's for people who need to level their tailoring to 300. Bags are really the only feasible way not to have to pour a bunch of gold into the grinder for the last set of tailoring levels. None of the other stuff you can make to gain levels in that range sells at anywhere near the mat price, and there is very little demand for the stuff that does even sell.
---
&gt;To think they would start off at patches 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and go on, would be stupid. Of course they kept it at 1.12. For better or worse.
---
The point I'm making is that this is in fact 2 major changes from "the game as how it was." First - the actual 1.12 stuff which I mentioned is very different from the content it's supposed to represent. Second - having a static state of balance is extremely different from how it was because they were constantly making balance patches. 
---
Thus, in order to get "the game as it was" there should be changes - whether those are changes to try to recreate the balance and challenges of the earlier patch versions, or changes that try to improve the balance in light of the fact that vanilla was a constantly changing product depends on how you interpret "the game as it was." But doing neither is not "the game as it was" at all.
---
We have two druids raiding, me and another guy.  We both have T2 head and Legs.  Think he is 7/8 T1 and I am 5/8, but T1 is kind of trash for healing and we are only wearing the pieces that we don't have the BiS for.  (Wild Growth Shoulder MUCH better than Cenarian)
---
We've also both been lucky on rolls and have some rings and necks over other healers.  Cauterizing Band for both of us!
---
Downside, after the next few pieces of gear, no loot for a long time.
---
Yeah I am hoping  they merge some of the new servers.
---
i was wondering how this was so well co-ordinated but then it turned out to be a livestreamer
---
This is a bullshit opinion. He is completely right, Need means you actually need the item and are going to use it on your character. That is more important than someone else making gold off of it. This is a new mentality and back in the day it was not like this. People rolling to sell shit vs people who actually need it for their character is horse shit. By that argument you should put a monetary value on every item that drops.
---
Oh for sure I just meant to question whether or not it was really worth prioritizing using a gun in a dwarf, for example, rather than a weapon with better stats for a hunter JUST to get the gun skill bonus.
---
That's why as a paladin I just kill the pet. :p
---
&gt; What kind of BRD runs do I want to do to get XL jumper cable runs
---
FYI these plans are BOE and like 10g off the AH
---
I thought it was how you are doing proportionally to other players, I will read how it actually works cus I forgot completely it seems
---
Stop being reasonable, where am I gonna put this pitchfork?
---
Wall jumping in Darkwhisper Gorge to sneak into the empty zone Hyjal back in TBC. Then, using a Noggenfogger Elixir to slow-fall back down all the way to Darkshore.
---
Back in earlier years in TBC that's kind of what started happening: lots of group queues and then that eventually gave way to pre-mades. 
---
Alliance pre-mades were more rare for my group, and for whatever reason, it was a pretty stereotypical "Horde is good PvP, Alliance sucks" experience back then as well lol 
---
There were a lot of epic hours long fights though and that was so good.
---
Indeed. Used those shoulders of the monkey aswell when FCing before rank 10
---
Learning towards mage.
---
1) Multiple sources of CC - priest can fear, mage can use freezing abilities, as well as polymorph, these do not share a DR.
---
2) Magewater, really important for a spriest, they are very mana hungry.
---
3) Portals - get to places faster.
---
It's not a zero sum game. I stated I did not really buy into the argument that you presented, I merely furthered that line of thinking another step to show how silly it is.
---
To clarify I am simply stating that I believe it is fairer for EVERYONE to roll on EVERY high end BoE because gold and items are interchangeable in this game. When I see "Freezing Band" I see 500g and not an item that increases frost effects by 22. It is in the interest of everyone in the group to have that gold/item, not just the individual who can equip that item.
---
Are you saying the alliance and horde shouldnt be at war lol? Go play a different game. You refuse to play pve cause you want Azeroth to not have ganking lmao
---
&gt; You don't fear mages because they can barely kite you
---
LOL wat
---
&gt;For BoEs it has literally never been this way except premade groups.
---
Wrong. For verification, I drove 25 minutes to buy the game at midnight on release night.
---
OP linked a post from about a month ago, when they were all level 30s.  
---
Once I get these all to 30, would you consider that *sufficiently impressive,* random internet person?
---
Because that's easy. All it takes is time.
---
They would have to start working on it now to get it ready in a couple years I want them to have good heads up.
---
also huge arean fan but the one problem i see there...  
---
patches(or lack thereof) and the resulting never changing meta  
---
not sure how they will tackle that
---
I will definitely move to TBC since my goal is to experience endgame raiding at the appropriate level.
---
Just wanna say, I completely fucking agree with you. This new "oh it's worth gold so we need it just as much" is a bull shit opinion.
---
And 3 levels higher. I just got super lucky but sometimes you gotta take luck!
---
‚ÄúImmediate amnesia and forget everything at my disposal‚Äù
---
Help I‚Äôm being personally attacked
---
It is proportional to other players, but many/most/a lot of the 60s know the deal so it isn't like you'd have no competition. But I'd be curious to see how high you could get in a week! Report back with your progress when it happens
---
Definitely doesn‚Äôt count, the whole barrens is Horde territory, that gets you close to level 30 I think by the end
---
There is no heads up. Just because Classic got released doesnt mean *Classic*+ is.
---
Except that killing a faction leader is difficult and requires you to create a raid and you're going to have a hard time killing them more than once before the other side shows up en masse. 
---
Conversely, camping players at Flight Points is easy and spammable.
---
So questing is a nightmare unless you beg for free shit?
---
The two by far the most common specializations to level with is either combat swords or subtlety daggers both have very different play styles from each other. Combat swords are faster, some say by \~10%, and more straight forward. Subtlety daggers are more dynamic and focuses on stealth and is much better at PvP. I find subtlety more fun but you should look into both and decide by yourself. Or just be crazy and go Assassination or mix as you like. :D
---
If you're in a dungeon and are unsure which opener to use from stealth, don't use cheap shot. It's very annoying for tanks if not used correctly.
---
Yes my guild is starting to sell it. We bring them in and master loot it to the person. We have all 3 of our main hunters with it already.
---
You have to be inside the raid when it drops, and they will generally summon you to the fight.
---
A person USING the item is worth MORE than 200 gold. Hence, need is more value than greed. Greed is selling the item. Need is using it. Need is not "i want to make money off of this", that's fucking greed.
---
eh, not really
---
mages get short cd frost nova w/ a 10 min reset, ice block, cone of cold which slows longer than it's CD, etc etc etc... and you can always **just use frost armor and blink away from any extra mobs you pull**. Actually, forget blink. Just WALK away. It's really easy. 
---
as for hunter your pet is pretty beastly and you lvl and kill stuff way easier than any other class
---
so youre just wrong... there isnt much micromanaging at all. There is no stance dancing or resources to really worry about until you are close to 0 mana, which is pretty easy to avoid, especially at higher levels. 
---
Paladins by contrast output far less dmg so healing is generally needed regardless of pulling extra mobs. You dont have a way to slow shit so your BOP and bubble are only gonna get you so far. And end game you heal, which is significantly more important than DPS and a bad healer is extremely harmful to your group. 
---
If I had a person in my life trying to play and looking for the easiest time while still being super powerful, hunter and mage are the top two choices by 1000 miles. Locks are also a really good option for power and easy of use, but theyre a little more intricate than mages. 
---
Rogues are huge for power but require a lot more skill than a mage to be functional. Warriors are basically the worst choice possible, as they are both the hardest to play class and weakest class until late game epics (and they take forever to lvl and easily die to 2 mobs with no way to survive or escape while lvling). 
---
Priest isnt a bad choice, as shadow is pretty easy and suuuuuper strong for how easy it is to play, but you will be expected to heal which again, is a problem for bad players as a bad healer is very harmful to the group. 
---
Druid has a lot of management to play well so prob just a bad choice, although a lot of noobs to manage to successfully play it as it really isnt THAT bad to be competent with, just hard to master. You can heal easily w/ hots and have a simple bear form to resort to. 
---
Mage/Hunter still by far the easiest choices. A ton of up front power, very forgiving, and have a very easy to achieve skill floor. It's true that a mage can potentially reach a high skill ceiling, but it doesnt take much to play the class at 90% of its potential. Same with hunters.
---
Depends. What class is she playing? Where on the scale from "I will clear Naxx" to "I just want to play a Night Elf because they are pretty" does she fall?
---
I'm in this photo and I don't like it.
---
Arms is not a pve tree.
---
I guess I'm just surprised that a game this level graphics makes a pretty decent rig hit 30 FPS.
---
Makes me want to upgrade...not good news for my bank account!
---
You‚Äôre correct. It‚Äôs greedy to take high value boe because you can equip it. You are taking huge amounts of potential needed gold from your team over pure luck. Especially in pug groups. Everyone earned it, they deserve that gold as much as you.
---
&gt;Maybe they did.
---
Yes I love how no one said that.
---
Casual likely won‚Äôt get to tank raids. So you will casually tank dungeons and casually get a dps set to casually pug raids and casually do BGs.
---
Started with 2 IRLs, 1 gone, other 1 lives in another country now and not close...
---
I can only see the end, dead server (judgement EU) too
---
Twinks ? I'm not super familiar with vanilla so I'm not even sure twinks are a thing. But that's the only benefit I see
---
its a pvp item as the spell power is a bit lower than other caster robes. and people dont generally count epic gear with &lt;1% drop rates as pre-raid bis. but yeah generally ppl get confused why i even want those since there are better robes for pve and theyre too dumb to know anything else.
---
Tbf weren't troggs literally failed prototype dwarves?
---
Literally
---
Jack of all trade arms is a dumpster fire build, you don‚Äôt get the good points in fury to be viable in competive pvp, and all of the deep arms skills are trash for tanking. Fury prot only works if you already are geared from raiding as deep prot.
---
I think they mean to go through the mage so the spell gets cancelled by causing a "the target must be in front of you" message. If they can face you before the spell flys, it'll land though.
---
Well not allowing ppl to roll need on high value items could be considered greedy. You are taking huge amounts of potential gold they need because you got lucky. The group earned it the group rolls.
---
Can confirm, Sulfuras is a good all around for either faction.
---
Same tbh
---
True, but you could say that about every question posted here.
---
There is definitely a learning curve and yes, the YT vids of well geared mages effortlessly farming all the zombies in ZF in a single pull is not something one is going to be able to do off the bat.  It's incredibly frustrating until you start getting it down. I agree with the comment that little tweaks here and there can make the difference between getting destroyed or feeling like a god. The margin for error is thin. High risk/high reward. My only advice is to keep at it and start small with a couple/few easy mobs, then work your way up from there.
---
Gnome pride!
---
I honestly don't know, Majordomo's cache seems to act as a chest so I would guess that he probably didn't since he wasn't a part of any of the actual kills.
---
Often times in MC and ony we have one maybe two hunters.  Is the correct play to deny or grant them a hunter's mark debuff slot?  Some of the minor debuffs we have are warlock corruption, arthas' gift, and depending on procs the annihilator armor debuff.
---
You can dungeon from 52, you'll get your XP just farming gear in BRD and LBRS.  It's a bit of a grind, but if you really want to gear out that's sort of the way to do it.  I went from 53 to 58 just in BRD and hit 60 in LBRS.
---
Thus is the literally reason those punk ass bitches reserved like 50 names. So they can sell you them. I seen constant adverts for people srsly expecting someone to pay 50-100$ us for a name.
---
Except the crossbow that comes out with Alterac Valley is pretty much BIS for all PVP and PVE with the exception of raid bosses.
---

Come to sulfuras. Fairly close to 50/50. Allies had searing gorge entrance to Blackrock mountain on lockdown this past Sunday.

Without an influx of newer players, yes. Those looking to play AH meta-games have Retail available to them for that.

No. One of the worst talents in any of our trees.

yes, you can download any addon that allows moving map window in screen and just toss it to the extended screen.
---
I actually never got my whirlwind axe. Though I've been using ravager for quite some time. Hoping for the 2h princess mace over the gatorbite axe.  
---
I've still been doing a lot of 2h tanking as well, usually 2h at the beginning of the fight for extra damage and threat, switching to shield midfight to give the healer a bit of a break. Really depends on my level and how efficient the healer can get though.  
---
I've been really loving the spec, I'll be sad if i need to change later on. It feels like it's a good hybrid for pvp/dps/tank
---
How dare you not invite me to raid and get free gear when I don‚Äôt help the guild, don‚Äôt bring consumes, and refuse to be in discord.
---
I blame the weird wording of vanilla. You'll come across this a couple of times, or even the other way around. I don't think it's a bug, it's just...weird.
---
So sheltered.  So spoiled.
---
"enjoys" my ass
---
More mana regen means more sustained heals during a fight. Healing gear is a mix of +healing, MP5, and spirit is good too
---
No probem :)
---
It's not even going for that much.  It is like 15g on the AH and the quest gives you 4g for completing it.
---
Troll shadow priest or shaman my man.
---
Was heroic too hard?
---
‚ÄúI want to play a Night Elf because they are pretty.‚Äù But she changed to a human mage.
---
Smart man. I started SM runs at 32. I‚Äôm now level 47 and I have not done more than 1-2 quests (if that! Might have worked on a quest while waiting for a dungeon group but never finished it). Soo basically did not quest from 32-47. And I‚Äôm 100% running ZF until 50, then going to do Sunken temple until 52-53ish, then BRD AOE runs until 55. At 55 I‚Äôll swap to full healing spec (I was shadow priest while leveling) and farm my pre BIS before 60. By the time I get what I need, I‚Äôll be 60.
---
Your &gt; and &lt; are backwards in some spots in your post.  I.e. I think you meant to post:
---
Spell Hit &gt; Spellpower(or shadow damage) &gt; crit &gt; int
---
Yea BRM is a regularly visited area by high lvl players.  The problem i see is most of those players are 60, in a group, and typically have better than questing gear on.  Also they can just zone into the instances to get away.  
---
I was thinking maybe Darrowshire, or Lights Hope Chapel in EPL where everyone will mostly be solo, and you can kill them multiple times near a graveyard where they will respawn over and over.
---

I don't even have my character screen bound, back in vanilla C was my PvP trinket bind.  I've used that as my get-out-of-stuff-quick hotkey since on any game I play.

---
Probably gonna want to start tailoring early cause you are most likely going to want to make Robe of the Void. Once you make the robe most people drop the skill. Beside that I would go for straight gathering herb, mining, or skinning if you want gold.
---
Having leveled both, I would say Mages are more straightforward in both their damage output and utility, while Warlocks are just weird and fun.
---
I can hear the mission music just by watching this image...

Level an alt fren. You probably couldn't be that far along on your main, could you?
---
I did this in vanilla or maybe TBC. Worked for a couple of weeks then I got a 72 hour ban. I only did it for 5g but still technically a scam so I understand the ban.
---
I don't play a mage, so I have a question, at :57 the frostbolt crits at 621, but there there is also another 370 hit. What is this? I thought maybe you PoMed something but I dont see the buff prior to it.
---
Oh, I didn;t necessarily mean racial wise, just race wise.
---
IT's definitely a personal thing that I prefer trolls and night elves to humans and orcs.
---
I've done about the same amount with a guild and have nothing to show for it either. I'm a fury warrior and there's only been two or three drops total that I could use, and I compete with 4-5 other people for them. That's just how RNG goes. At least, being in a guild, I will eventually get loot if it ever drops. You should definitely find a guild or you'll never have any such guarantee.
---
I was implying that
---
Right.  It's not as if fury warriors are suddenly  going slow/slow as a result of the heroic strike bug to make sure they're maximizing their offhand damage, because that would severely gimp rage generation.  The bug is cool and is good to know but the itemization and playstyle isn't changing as a result, really.
---
druid is fucking boring from level 1 to 22. then you finally get another skill that is not auto attack and you have cat form with 30% r/w
---
A good tip is if you are low on HP, blind/gouge/cripp poison (and sprint for distance), then try to bandage yourself for some extra HP.
---
As for openers/moves it depends on the type of elite, casters you can typically just ambush/evi as long as you kick between.
---
High armor enemies should be garroted and other effects that don't require you to break your weapons on their armor.
---
&gt;mine for salt
---
&gt;typical smug tryhard alliance douchers fall for it hook line and sinker
---
It's proportional to how you do compared to others on your server.  So without BG's, the vast majority of players won't have much honor points, so those who are actively grinding it will have a disproportionately large amount, and thus will rank up much faster than if you wait till phase 3 when everyone and their brother can easily farm honor in BG's.
---
I guess you forgot to not post on it either?
---
Or just plan ahead because the first sleep always happens predictably at the 10 second mark
---
I especially liked the part where what I said went completely over your head and then you went off like an 11 year old having an argument at recess.
---
I have no problem with pvp or wpvp. I have no problem with ganking people. I have no problem of you choose to enjoy that or not.
---
The mentality behind someone who finds satisfaction and self worth in *griefing* someone who is entirely defenseless and then camping them for an hour is completely different and aside from the mentality of someone who enjoys open world pvp at a level that is beyond right-clicking someone and killing them with a single auto attack. You have every right to do that and I would not take away that freedom. But let's be real, if that is where you derive satisfaction and self worth, then I pity you as a person.

Is there any forge closer to AH / Bank in Org. or is only one in NE near mining / bs trainer?
---
I still think it might be an addon effecting/corrupting/overloading the cache. This issue doesn't seem to be hitting everyone but I haven't been able to figure out the cause yet.
---
Of my regular 5 man group just two of us have the increased load times from cache and we use a lot of the same addons. And very different hardware.
---
I'm too invested in my alliance toons to quit now, but man, I wish ignored my family to roll horde. Alliance Fps are jacked up on kalimdor, boats are annoying and inconvenient when compared to zeps, STV is a nightmare to navigate in your 30s, Horde has easy access to ALL of the early leveling dungeons other than deadmines. The only saving grace, easy access to BRD/BRS/MC is negated by how long it takes to get to Scholo/Strat/Naxx/DM
---
Dude again, no server/community I have ever played with in WoW has Needing to Sell not been viewed as greedy and self serving. 
---
1. You ARE arguing. Get over yourself. 
---
2. Do what you want bro I don‚Äôt give a shit what you do. But at least have the decency to say you plan on needing on BOEs at the start of a run. Just like you should say you plan reserving X drop at the beginning of the run. Because it‚Äôs not the norm and never has been. So that people can decide to not run with your weird loot rules. 
---
3. ‚ÄúI know this is BIS/Near BIS for you and you will probably use it for many levels or months but I want gold that won‚Äôt matter after I have my epic mount really.‚Äù This is all I hear when you say Gold is Gear.

"I don't like your opinion, you must be elitist and bothering literally everyone because it bothers me."
---
Relax dude, it's a discussion, no need to get all mad about it. Maybe you should take a break and cool off.
---
Horde actually.

Iirc blizz allows gambling as long as you don't set up a "casino" service with the odds being in favor of the house.

I cast frostbolt and fire blast at the same time and it avoids the global cool down. Just a way to get some extra quick damage!
---
The female undead is worse. LOL
---
I dont remember the auto invite until wotlk. I spent many hours sending pms to join or form groups in bc.
---
I used variations of this spec a lot while leveling, don‚Äôt bother trying to set up backstabs while soloing, keep a slow sword and weapon swap macro + hemo instead. Daggers are total butt at fighting things face to face and spending 100 energy for BS to not crit 60% of the time is horseshit.
---
I eventually swapped away from the ambush opener to garrote + rupture. Even with the auto crit i felt like it wasn‚Äôt keeping up with mob health after level 40. Bleeds have their downsides but they transfer via blade flurry and benefit from hemo and the constant damage ticks ‚Äúfelt‚Äù better to me (even though my average kill time stayed largely the same)

Nobody recently. Posts like OPs are directed towards those that were shitting on the game before release and in the initial weeks of the game.

You do realise that in vanilla, de facto leader of Stormwind and the Aliance is Onyxia?
---
by chat channels I meant trade chats in large cities yeah. 
---
also in terms of dungeoning, try not do dungeons that are far away from where you are questing. around deadmines level you'll either by in westfall or redridge mountains so you can also find people posting about public dungeon groups in those zone chat channels.

Do your work in TB the forge is next to both AH / Bank

that or somone fiinds a site that doesnt have a password rate limiter and eventually pwns you via rainbow table. and since you used that password on that site, and keep it the same, they now can guess your gmail or other things.
---
How often do you play?
---
Dude you need to not take any of this as an attack on Classic because it's really messing with the way you're processing all of this.
---
You remember launch - long hours of queue times throughout every realm. There were at least 7 layers per realm, each layer able to hold 3,000 players. So a specific realm could hold 21,000 players. 
---
Now, most realms only have 1 layer. Meaning they don't have the population in each realm to really justify having all those layers.
---
3,000 / 21,000 ~ 14% of the original capacity. Meaning an 86% drop off rate from launch. 
---
Even if 90% of the original population at launch stopped playing, that doesn't mean its a dead game or no one wants to play classic wow.
---

The blunt truth about why people treat guilds as a raid finder:
---
Because to many people this is still just a video game, not a second life.
---
I made many friends in bc and wotlk. never spoke to any of them again when we all quit. I‚Äôm under no delusions this time that any of these people are my friends and I know they view me as a disposable nobody who can add some dps just as much as I view them as simply a way to get gear.
---
The percentages are correct but the item has an "of shadow wrath" modifier. It can roll with any one of many modifiers. (fire/frost/shadow/nature/etc)

Mid 50s alliance player doing BRD during prime server time = 6+ corpse runs. The worst part is if alliance ever does temporarily control  the long hallway to the instance it only lasts for about 10-15 minutes until you see a tidal wave of horde crash down on the area who then linger for the next 3 hours

I think the dwarf racial can indeed save you. Troll hunter myself but if you accidentally get dog aggro from the first courtyard and take some hits, the dogs put a really nasty bleed on you, from which I think it would save you quite nicely!

I am not a skinner ‚Äî Loot and sell the junk for copper/silver. Lol @ OP for not taking the opportunity of this tremendous easy peasy money making scheme + coming off as a major jerk.
---
From how naive you are, and that you cant realize that this is a video game about war and not real life. I hope one day you can recognize when to let go and have some fun and not take things too seriously. It sounds like maybe multiplayer games arent for you. Try animal crossing! If you have free time to log into wow you have free time to corpse run. You signed up for that when you joined a pvp server. Being behind in levels or playing an alt is a detriment that you will have to learn to play with. People are allowed to kill you so they will. You dont have to kill lowbies if you dont want to.
---
In fact why dont you get to 60 and spend all your time protecting lowbies and counter ganking. Since you are si concerned for other peoples time
---
Looks fine to me on Reddit is Fun. What app are you using?
---
The fact that you don't understand how hit scales up shows that, while you may have joined a reliable source, you're not actually fully understanding the material, since joining a Discord doesn't magically make you an expert.  IDGAF about your /played.
---
BRE is BiS trash killing weapon and rivals naxx weapons and r14 2hs in pvp.
---
For literally everything in classic wow the more the merrier applies.
---
I think I'm going to get there soon. I'm closing in on 60 and will have most of my tank pre-raid items since I've been leveling through dungeons. If I actually manage to find a guild to raid with that isn't already full on tanks, that should only be 2 night max. I'll probably make an alt that will be leveled by the time battlegrounds are implemented. I feel like they're going to have to release content faster than expected since everybody is racing through it 10x faster than release, otherwise they will slowly lose playerbase.
---
And honestly, if you're not enjoying it, there are better things to do that trying to force the nostalgia.
---
Tbf his post had nothing to do with loot council directly. Guild ghosts would still not get invites if it was a roll off or dkp guild
---
‚ÄúGet that weak shit outta here‚Äù -OP
---
It's very simple. If you dont show interest in playing with anyone in your guild outside of raid nights, how are they certain investing gear into you is worth it?

For all they know, you could leave the guild or quit playing at anytime.
---
Hunters are trash. Change my mind.
---
If you want to do a dungeon, it can take some time to get all the quests for that dungeon. Some require you to complete other quests before you can get one for a dungeon and some quest givers are just not nearby. Take a look at this guide before you go into a dungeon so you can get all the quests before you start it:
---
[List of Classic Dungeon Quests - Wowhead](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/dungeon-quests-classic-wow)
---
You can only share some of these quests with your party, as everyone needs to have completed the pre-requisites to be eligible, or if the questgiver gives you an item to use, it's not shareable.

A guild member did a dung with a mage who charged for the mage water
---
I left tonight, they got a load of people they used to raid with attuned for Ony and MC(Many not level 60) and gave them raid spots over others who have been in the guild since the start of Classic.
---
I joined this guild off the back of a recommendation from an RL friend and they decided to roll on a PVE server.
---
Now I'm leaving the server too and going for a PVP server.
---
I'm usually on for an hour or two a night. My job requires me to away from home once every 8 days. 
---
Probably should've put that in the description.
---
Unless it‚Äôs an addiction and you‚Äôre neglecting everything else in your life by playing a game 16 hours a day. But hey other than that it‚Äôs fine!
---
unfortunately, it's laid out as best it can be, people just think they deserve everything. Which is fine, it'll be a fun time when I get a piece of loot over them being an spriest it'll cause drama but their class leader will say, well you should have been helping new members, or getting your bis over your youtube gold farm. The best part about being active is you gain that trust from those around you, and develop friendships. Had someone say well I don't know anyone so I pug things....We have around 10 people in discord at peak hours just having fun, even others who aren't in game hang out and bs. It's really a good time.
---
Hope this is ironic lol
---
It's more 'your' job to actively try to fit in rather then them holding your hand and showing you how to do it. Being a part of a guild and raiding should incentivize you to be social and active when possible, work for the greater good of the guild rather than your own good. 
---
 Having people being outspoken, social, helpful and engaged are qualities people look for in raiders the same way a workplace would for the employed. You are part of a group, earn your spot.
---
That's really helpful! Thanks for the link. The only issue here is that I can kill two mobs because I can wand them down at the end. This guy's gear is leagues ahead of mine; he has more than 1,000 extra mana and therefore the ability to keep doing damage until they're dead. :(
---
I'll still work on my pulls and keep in mind some of the things he says, though. That's super useful.

LOOT YOUR KILLS BRO

There's a guy in my guild that's had the name "Fillmyass" since launch...
---
How on earth is it a disgrace? The honor system is not even live. You literally get nothing from it. I am talking about players who can easily take on other players with no challenge what so ever. How is that even fun? To me that is a disgrace.
---
Yeah, I remember them being pretty decent sellers back in the day.  Ppl are still saving up for gear currently.
---
I think the interesting part is looking at way back to 2004: https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;geo=US&amp;q=%2Fm%2F021dvx,%2Fm%2F0k9bc90
---
What we can see is that classic is globally similar to WoD both in numbers and dynamic but it's nowhere near the old numbers and there's no steady growth.
---
So... for a 15yo games it's actually quite amazing to beat last two extensions but at the same time the game peaked at release and while it will probably keep a healthy population, people will slowly go away and it will become a niche
---
Ain't that the truth.
---
Since blizzard take no visible actions against farm bots (reported bots still appear at the same location they have been reported at), I expect a wild fun during pvp once BGs come out.
---
Yes but anyone could do that. That's the point! The damn guild leader could just gquit. You are asking everyone else in the guild to place trust in you without question since you are the guild leader, but you won't place any trust in members unless they check your non communicated boxes.
---
Accuria is definitely not 100% bis for fury warriors for all of vanilla.

The twinks strat is for the twinks to run into the boss and die then have the other party members kill the boss and the dead twinks can still claim the loot with zero xp
---
Can you read? Do you understand the meaning of request?
---
You said they recreated batching by community request and source this claim by providing a reaction thread to them introducing batching. To prove your point you need a community thread that precedes batching‚Äôs introduction
---
What you‚Äôve provided is precisely what I already conceded: no one requested it, but initially after blizz introduced it ppl were excited for it.
---
Again: NO ONE requested batching until AFTER blizzard introduced it
---
Sure, but would you say you can level to 30 as Horde in the barrens, stone talon mountains, and thousand needles generally without interference by the Alliance?
---
These zones have flight paths for Alliance, but generally lack a reason to use them, unless they are needed for a connecting flight.  And Barrens is friendly to Horde all the way 25+, you can‚Äôt quest past 20 as Alliance without leaving a friendly zone.
---
the ven diagram of boomers and zoomers in tech is about 100% overalapping at this point.

5MCs + 7 Onys in a guild with loot council. Just BOE belt + T2 helm + ony head(getting DEed wev got so many) so far.
---
On my server, every guild I was looking at joined said "always need locks". No other slot has been a possibility in every guild.
---
The key part here is it‚Äôs a guild run - you acted in your own self interest in a way that was harmful to the overall effectiveness of your team for the reasons described here. Granted it‚Äôs just a game and it‚Äôs a blue item from ubrs so not exactly the end of the world..
---
Welcome to classic, where if you want to take on a final boss you gotta wade through some greys. It sucks, but it‚Äôs only for the first few pulls. 44 is the recommended level for tank.
---
Nope, I don't have Frostbite. I think what it was is I was using Flamestrike + CoC too early!
---
I still don't have enough mana to do this reliably but maybe with my mana gem and some luck I can do a bit better. :D
---
\- Mark of the Wild is the single best buff in the game. So buff everyone you see and you'll make friends fast. Thorns is very useful and if you're grouped up in an instance, please make sure to buff the tank with Thorns.
---
\- Feral spec is the BEST spec for leveling 1 to 60. Period. Balance is a joke unless you spend all your time teaming up with a mage that can provide you water. Resto is kinda useless before endgame and it just make leveling a pain. Feral allows you to BOTH dps and tank reliably in 5 mans, and as a bear tank, you will be in great great demand due to the general tank shortage across all servers.
---
\- There are two popular specs for leveling and endgame: Pure Feral (14/32/5) or Feral-Healing Hybrid (0/30/21). The latter is especially popular as it allows the druid to switch from tanking to raid healing on the same spec.
---
\- Teleport to Moonglade is a godsend for training. Just make sure you have your hearthstone ready to go or you'll have no choice but to always ride back to Thunder Bluff until very late in the game when you'll finally get connecting flight points to travel elsewhere on Kalimdor.
---
\- Be aware of your incredible utility. Combat res can and will save your group from bad wipes (happened not too long ago in RFD when our tank died ... got him back into the fight in 2 seconds and he pulled the boss and adds back). Innervate will save your group from wipes due to healers going oom. Cleansing both poisons AND curses on the same class is amazing. Faerie Fire is a giant dps boost for all your physical damage classes.
---
\- Use ALL your different forms as needed. Never just stick to one thing. If you're in kitty form and get a bunch of adds, switch to bear form. If you're tanking as bear for a group, switch to cat to scout ahead in stealth as needed. You have a low health runner that is seconds away from pulling adds? Switch to humanoid form and blast them with Moonfire until they stop.
---
WIN+Shift+S babyyyyy
---
snipping tool is hawt af too tho
---
Make sure you get to 60 before p2! You got this pvp servers can be a pain in the ass, and really fun!
---
If you alliance... watch your back. Zug zug
---
I fucking love the MC drama lately. It's literally going to be on farm for like ever... everyone needs to calm the hell down.
---
Can't wait to see it get ramped up a notch in BWL. I can see all the "I lost my raid spot due to x,y, or z." pity party posts already XD
---
You should never, ever be leveling Holy. You don't need to be holy to heal dungeons, literally just throw on an int set and you're good to go.
---
Yes this is a late in Vanilla change to five only.
---
It's you that don't understand how hit works buddy, and if you don't even know the fightclub discord then you are by defualt a fucking shitter. I'm done replying to you.
---
Is there an exact monetary value where something becomes worth needing? Or you just play it by ear?
---
After all, 1g is 1g. It all adds up, why not need everything? We all need gold.
---
Over rag weapons? Crazy.
---
What the disgrace is, is you and your attitude, not pvp.
---
fyi if you cast ice block again while you are in the block it will debuff you .. don't need to click the buff
---
Strat ud is awful even as geared players.
---
What server I run these nightly at 15-25g for the ring drop. I'd bring you in if you're on my server. I've done it for 5 guildies already ez.
---
Is there any accurate way one could estimate classic players based on the number of subs here?
---
It's a fair assumption that 90% of us have active subs. Also assuming that 20% of the classic population are joined to this sub, were talking meaningful numbers.
---
I only took a semester of statistics but i think somewhat accurate numbers could be extracted from this information.
---
Look I love PvP when I know it's going to challenge me. If it's a simple click and they are dead, what's the point.
---
&gt; It's the reacting part. If they react at 50%, and tank gets unlucky cb/crit, it's a wipe.
---
Nothing in leveling dungeons will hit your tank for 50% in a single hit other than that one boss in WC.
---
&gt; If all they do is auto+seal, they're going to get nearly out dps'ed by a bm hunter's pet.
---
1. Wrong
---
2. Nobody gives a shit about DPS meters in leveling dungeons, m8
---
Yes, but what does chatting and socializing have to do with being helpful. Someone asks in guild chat for help doing xyz, I help them, I don't socialize, I don't chat; that doesn't mean I won't help.
---
This is all killer info. I just wanna add that rogues struggle vs elite mobs or any mobs tbh more than almost every other class, so OP don‚Äôt feel discouraged if you are finding it a challenge.
---
&gt; Not possible for 99% of us.
---
it's way more exclusive than 1%
---
I‚Äôll kill any rogue I see regardless of the level difference, they will gank someone else in unfair circumstances at some point. So get em while you can.  Also it‚Äôs not a kid you‚Äôre punching. It‚Äôs another person who chose to log on and pick a pvp server. Comes with the territory.  The game is called World of Warcraft, not world of socially polite and faircraft. That sounds like a game I would not play.
---
Richtig :D
---
It‚Äôs a run.. I hate it
---
Asserting dominance.
---
I‚Äôm loving it as well. A tiny queue once in a blue moon but almost always full. Friendly population and a lot of activity!
---
the difference between r11 and r13 is insane.
---
But you actually did in TBC... in season 3 :)
---
The guy is putting on an act to troll. Epics dont drop from junkboxes and that moron isnt swedish.
---
These plastic surgeons are out of control
---
Clutch AF.

/cringe
---
Ya I like to think as tb and uc as passing through cities for convenience. Even tho I choose to chill more in Uc than Org cuz I‚Äôm a mage
---
You are joking right? A hunter has 41 yards range so once you manage to disengage the warr should NEVER reach you again. 
---
I mean i manage to out range casters like sp or shamans. Unless the warr charges you while at 50% fighting 2 mobs you should be able to make him wish he rolled something else. And you only need 3 buttons and 2 brain cells.
---
Mograine is very alive even at night, but yeah if you're trying to start some RFK at 4am that's asking a bit too much.
---
You are however lying. /who 60 will absolutely never show under 50
---
I‚Äôm sorry to have upset you so much that instead of just scrolling past this you had to type out a response and lose 3 minutes of your day. I know that must be hard for you, but in this hard to time I want you to know that, that I‚Äôm here for you. I‚Äôm here to ask as many obvious questions that you need me too, just day the word
---
&gt;I cannot rerun the same dungeon over and over like some people do.
---
I hate to break it to you, but that's what the endgame looks like. A handful of dungeons and three raids.
---
Until BG's that is.
---
2 deathbringers 1 viskag 3 brutality blades 3 accurias 1 onslaught so far. Not too bad :x
---
You can bring people in after killing the king and spawning the chest. The chest doesnt despawn, and 90% of mobs in the instance will be friendly ( Despite being red) after killing the king. There are methods for getting any class to the end without much issue
---
Straight up uninformed
---
the first part of the rake is physical damage, but elementals can't bleed. similar to if you use rake on skeletons. you'll get the physical portion, but not the bleed portion
---
Fastest way to level an alt: the same way you level a main.
---
There is little to no benefit of having a high level in your party to "help" you level. Powerleveling doesn't exist. Exp penalties will apply if you party with a high level, exp penalties will apply if you try to tag a mob and have a unpartied high level kill it.
---
So to answer: have the mage follow your character around to ward of any gankers (if you are on a pvp server), provide food/water/buffs/portals, only party to take portals and to run the low level character through a dungeon once after grabbing all dungeon quests for it.
---
So does DM and it's a lot faster.
---
Yea fuck skinners! I like to leave evidence of the carnage I cause, don‚Äôt be cleaning it up with your worthless profession
---
NICE!
---
15gold. We are casual guild so alot is still under lvl 40 or around 40. But we gathered some gold from the people online.
---
I type /join lookingforgroup
---
This is a channel my server uses to find groups for dungeons. Your server might have this channel also
---
Totally this. This was the most amazing part of the video!
---
I don't necessarily agree with everything you said but I am experiencing something similar in some respect.  There's a core group of people who show up for MC/ony and do nothing else, They don't group they don't farm, they don't help anyone else, they log on for raids get loot and logoff.  And they're not even BiS or greatly geared, It honestly makes me question if I should move on.
---
Just dont forget to add dat flair.
---
I mean, they both do and you need them both.
---
Ive used it to know how safe it is to auto attack and pool rage.
---
Sounds more like a management problem. Use a signup sheet.  
---
There will always be trash players with a bad mentality, it's the officers/guildmasters job to sort them out.
---
My general rule is to be at the required level to equip the last boss's drops. You can go a level below work a good group.
---
I won the roll on flameguard but gave it to the second roll since I have edgemaster's. Still kinda torn not knowing if I did the right thing or not.
---
Jump runs with a healer (ideally shaman)
---
I'm assuming you did this as Sub spec? , was there a guide you watched or something? if so could you Dm me what you did?
---
i highly recommend it, if youre horde pst me if you need anything im Kiven
---
You still get the notification in chat window though sadly
---
They're not actually. My buddy whispered one once and got a response.
---
Katrina is Onyxia? Slander, you‚Äôll hang for that.
---
make sure you macro /startattack to both maul and swipe. have a potion/consume macro.
---
if you like mouseovers, put growl and/or charge on a mouseover (I don't like them for offensive abilities, personally)
---
Alright who hurt you?
---
Because no healer gear needs orbs to make, right?
---
Both version of the game have the same networking back end. Even with less particle effects and garbage retail does, the issues with handling 40v40 are very real with the cloud virtual servers they are using.
---
I don't get how this is an issue though. It's an issue for a good player, recognizing that his dps decreases if mobs get to a dead zone.
---
But for just killing shit, the pet can solo equal level mobs albeit slowly, just fine.
---
That would make a huge difference lol
---
As a healer priest, is there a reason to farm Sunken Temple at all or just move on to BRD and DM?
---
I know there‚Äôs the darkestone and Atal‚Äôai Gloves but the RNG for that to drop ON TOP OF the RNG to get ‚Äú...of healing‚Äù scares me.
---
Are there easier obtained pre bis gear for these slots? Also no one seems to run this instance based off of world chat
---
Posts a pic of a human expecting us to believe it's a tauren..... cant fool me OP!
---
I hit 40 on my Priest last night, and this is the first character I've gotten this high. I'm doing a pretty good balance of solo questing and dungeons, and most of my dungeon runs with a pre-made group of RL friends. In those situations and all the PUG dungeon runs I've done so far, I am obviously the healer.
---
I've been leveling with most of my talent points in Discipline, which has been mostly fine for solo questing as I've figured out the right spell rotation and wand use balance. However, I've noticed that after about level 35 or so, solo questing has gotten more difficult. It seems the popular thing to do is respec to Shadow at 40. I'm intrigued and I have questions:
---
* How much healing ability am I giving up if I respec to Shadow? Will I still be able to heal 5-man dungeons through to 60? My main group does not have another healer that could take my place.
---
* How hard is it for Shadow Priests to find PUGs as a DPS? Will I be able to put out respectable damage compared to the more traditional DPS classes? I'm not super concerned with raids, at least not for a while.
---
* How much faster/easier will my solo questing get if I respec to Shadow? How big is the damage increase? How much potential am I giving up if I don't respec?
---
Thanks for any and all input!
---
damn, im horde but on whitemane. I'm running them tonight actually.
---
Prot/holy. Be her knight in shining armour.
---
Too bad it feels like it's in the middle of nowhere. If only it had a zep.
---
its a 15 year old game, reasonable to assume not everyone on the team knows every piece of minutiae
---
Loot MY skins.
---
the level of your enchanting does not effect disenchant results, so either the addon is bugged or you got unlucky with the disenchant from the item.
---
It's like the "royal we" but for 2nd person. Probably a callback to german language in renaissance or medival times.
---
Etiquette for a hunter taming a quest kill? The do not hit it, and there for do not tag it, and if they give up or feel like they are gonna die they start attacking.  How many tries before you get to just ignore their attempt at taming and attack it?
---
No worries! Just be careful if you're a button spammer (I do it sometimes), because it will immediately remove Ice Block the second time you press it
---
Figured, and that is how I have been doing it (only level 16). But someone told me yesterday that if I filled up the group with other lowbies and ran a dungeon I would get a lot more xp. Is that true or worth?
---
Power leveling totally works to an extent, although I‚Äôm not sure the exact xp/hour vs a normal party. What I do know though is it‚Äôs way easier (organization wise) to have 1 person power level you then a dedicated dungeon cleave group that will sync there play time.
---
I looted it and we did a /roll after. There is no roll prompt when loting the cache.
---
Aha!
---
Now I know all your secrets! I will help guildies with dungeons, be active in the guild community, help out people in general, communicate and help officers and that way I will be more likely to get loot if the system is based on the loot council!
---
Cua next week when ur handing me my epic, nerd!
---
That sounds fun as fuck! What level is a good time to transfer to that build?
---
Core build looks to be 7/10/13 so level 40ish?
---
40g is 40g
---
Iirc plan on our live strat runs is tank reserves first, fair game after that
---
I want to add to this, your personality and play style matters too.  I do not want to spend 3-5 hours twice a week with someone who is a total jerk.  I don't care what your dps is or even if your little tanky ass can take a direct strike from a tactical nuke.  If you whine and complain or yell about stupid shit; if you're nasty in chat, if you belch and fart and yell at your kids with the mic keyed, you can fuck right off.  I don't want to play with you.
---
We got 2 OEBs on our first run. Still waiting to see a Mageblade, so I can roll a 1 on it and never see it again.
---
Dude the game is a solved problem. Warrior is top 1 dps already with their best specs. If you are playing arms for pve damage it's strictly worse than both 2h fury and dual wield fury.
---
For a quest mob? probably wouldnt even wait the first time, but I'm a bit of an asshole.
---
Have a Snickers
---
How much were gf and job going for in AH today?
---
I have a 60 in full pre bis and multiple MC epics. I also have two alts over 30. Again, you're choosing to ignore what I said and extrapolate your own words and meaning from it. You're creating an argument that never existed to begin with.
---
I have no problem if that's what you want to do. I deal with it just fine myself. I dont get upset when someone ganks me, it happens all the time and I've dealt with it for 15 years. I have been the ganker for probably longer than you have been playing this game entirely. Being upset over it is not something that anyone who has played for this long should feel. I never said that I am personally bothered by any of that and your haste to attack me and tell me the game is not for me is a true real-life indication of your maturity level. You are about as well equipped to handle a discussion of opposing opinions as an adolescent. So let's extrapolate from the things you've said so far just as you have my own:
---
"Your opinion does not agree with my own opinipn and therefore you are *WRONG*. If you do not agree with how I see the game is fit to be played then you better quit now because you just cant handle it."
---
Even though I said nothing about myself being upset by doing this, your response to me is that I should just essentially quit because I clearly am just not up to the task.
---
Completely agree! Lead by example
---
No one knows, slight alliance favor using old data (55/45)
---
Very detailed analysis! My experience is basically identical to yours, in raids im struggling with the cast time of heal, its too slow for burst dmg. All the damn pallys beat me to the heal lol.
---
I was reviewing the stats of our top healer and roughly 35% of his healing was renew (he had the improved healing talents) and 50% was greater heal. Im not sure which rank though. 
---
I too would like to improve and am curious what people think
---
That's phase 1 Warrior for you. They don't gain rage attacking through Power Word Shield so pretty much their only option is to run around and auto-attack. Pair that with having no way to break snares and slows and you've got yourself a recipe for a real bad time. 
---
If either of them were a different class you guys would have been in a lot more trouble.
---
Yea
---
I took it the other way. You finally get through the slog and hit 60, expecting to run Molten Core. Then your guild says: "sure, how's your gear?" And you realize that you won't be able to run MC until you're geared out. 
---
And the referenced dungeons are where you will find most pieces of BiS gear for all classes. Therefore the joke is that you hit 60 and expect to jump into MC immediately, when in reality you should be spamming these dungeons to get gear to prepare yourself for MC. Nobody wants to spam those dungeons after 60, though.
---
I don‚Äôt trust people with sexy map on default skin
---
Combat spec, too lazy to switch.  YouTube SwoleBenji, used his video as a guide.
---
It's cool. Ittl be a whole before I even get there and when I get there I'll still be excited cuz I've never done that and then there will be more content out.
---
 Even after that I'll help lower level guildies quest or play the AH. There's so much to do so it's pretty fun
---
I swapped at 50 because wpvp picked up a lot in the later zones but 40 should be fine. Just make sure you keep your daggers updated
---
He can‚Äôt, because none of this actually happened.
---
That's one reason I chose a three character name. Easy to remember and spell.
---
Do you mind sharing your talent guide for this? I'd like to do the same thing but want to make sure I use my talent points and stuff correctly :)
---
400,004

---
Not an anagram
---
only thing ironic about it is that OP's cell phone pictures come out better quality than my screenshots
---
I was hooked when I 1 shot my first gnome lol
---
Arms is a victim of having an amazing 31 pointer and 20 pointer in another tree. You're right, it completely strips away the flexibility.
---
31/5/15 is fine if you feel like you need the tank talents but completely unnecessary. Off-tanking isn't nearly tough enough to require a specialized build.
---
If you want to really contribute in a raid as the optimal 31/20 PvP spec then pick up either a Nightfall or Bonereaver's Edge.
---
Your ‚Äûlazy‚Äú solution sounds great :) thx
---
I mean Magni is clearly cast as the alliance leader, but yes the humans are run by a dragon.
---
You can cancel the listing. It‚Äôll cost you the deposit, but if your item sells for a fraction of its max price that‚Äôs probably worth it.
---
Earthfury
---
seriously. somehow i got viskag on my first ony run, which was a pug. beat out 9 other melee dps too. all my luck is gone for rest of wow
---
Couldnt agree more. I know this isnt the subreddit for this but OSRS has been fun since they made it avail on mobile. Outer Worlds is pretty great
---
If you ignore hit, cause hit cap is easily maintained without it, then Helm of Endless Rage from the second boss in BWL in P3 becomes better.
---
Even just mostly pre-bisd I've not really had an issue with it. People just need to keep an eye out for eyes and actually kick/cs bats and shit.
---
Arcane/ frost is fun but the problem with that build is not having ice block....ice block can save you a lot in raids if you fuck up. Like the living bomb fight in MC will blow up for 3k and nearly one shot you if healers aren‚Äôt on point. You should go deep frost without winters chill since there‚Äôs a good chance another mage will already have it.
---
Shatter is great for a quick nova and aoe cone of cold in dungeons.
---
Not seeing that on his loot table.

Hey man, I'd love Truestrike Shoulders, Eye of Rend, and Battleborn Vambraces.

Also for healers, Tooth of Gnarr and also a sick mp5 ring that I forget the name of.
---
&gt; How much healing ability am I giving up if I respec to Shadow? Will I still be able to heal 5-man dungeons through to 60? My main group does not have another healer that could take my place.
---
You should be absolutely fine leveling as shadow and healing dungeons.  All the way til 60.
---
&gt;How hard is it for Shadow Priests to find PUGs as a DPS? Will I be able to put out respectable damage compared to the more traditional DPS classes? I'm not super concerned with raids, at least not for a while.
---
Shouldnt be an issue to find groups, I played with multiple leveling my main and alt.  The DPS is comparable to other players, you also give vamp embrace which is an amazing ability.
---
&gt;How much faster/easier will my solo questing get if I respec to Shadow? How big is the damage increase? How much potential am I giving up if I don't respec?
---
Wish I could give you a % but MUCH FASTER is my answer to that.  Early on shadow is weak because you dont have shadowform or all of your abilities.  Once you hit 40, you can easily down mobs with dots, solo elites and frankly are a god in PVP.  Spirit Tap + Vamp Embrace are both very very good abilities for leveling.
---
Org is more shanty town than trailer park. If any city fits the description of trailer park it's Dalaran. People from all over who are trash, lead by corrupt (and possibly drunk as fuck leaders), and it's mobile.
---
Enjoy not having the sweet junk selling gold
---
You missed an opportunity to say Dire Maulway.  I'm disappointed.
---
I love this answer, ha ha!
---
Lmao ughh imagine thinking mitigation is important at all.
---
tanks wear several pieces of mail, hell even dual wield every boss in MC
---
Clearly this video proves we need to nerf priests and mages
---
I too am curious on all these points. Holy priest here, almost level 50, this is certainly relevant to me. Thanks for writing it up! I hope some folks can bring clarity.
---
Alliance zones are prettier, fact. Horde gets stuck with a ton of drab colors. The cities in particular are way more complex, and feel less hashed out.   
---
You might say that there's a certain edgy aesthetic with the whole undead motif, but hey, we have darkshire too.
---
Healing is gear is 100% yours anyways. Them passing the gear makes no sense because healing gear goes always to you as the healer. You gotta be stupid to join shit like this because you can easily start a group for living where everyone can roll on it without some scummy asshole reserving the orbs
---
Every loot council guild ive been in has been more mature and fair than any dkp guild.
---
The loot usually goes to the main tank first, top performers second, loyal and fun people third, and then the average player last. Ive been in about 7 different guilds in 2 different games who use this system. It works.
---
If you feel cheated in a loot council guild its most likely you thats the problem. Loot council guilds will implode quickly if any real injustices are done. They absolutely have to be fair or they wont survive.
---
Fuck
---
what happened to your ui mate? looks like the screen has cerebral palsy
---
Fun fact: if you die and leave your body, you will fail the quest, even if the other members of your group are still alive and escorting the chicken
---
The most frustrating stuff was when some rank 9 or 10 player either didn't know about the system, or decided to buck the system and gets 1st or 2nd honor that week out of left field (people we didn't even know to look out for because they weren't established in the least bit as part of the pvp community); effectively screwing two ppl out of HWL and ruining everything for multiple weeks for all the 12's and 13's in line. Meanwhile, they have done themselves zero favors because they were capped as to how much progress they could make that week. So they just wasted 25 extra hours that week pushing hard for literally no reason other than to screw some other people over.
---
I have my main and a few alts on alliance on one server and I'm starting horde on another server to play as a horde main and maybe a few alts if I don't like the main at 60. I only have experience playing shaman and paladin in vanilla at lvl 60 and I was very much a noob back then. This time, I'm thinking of going 1. shaman (undecided race) and actually playing right and gearing up in pve and pvp (i like big burst so ele or enhance works well and i dont mind healing), 2. warrior because ill be wanted as a tank and if im geared i can do some serious damage in pvp, 3. warlock because they probably have less gear competition than warrior and arguably better reliable burst and big crits as destro in pvp but require more time investment for shards in PvE.  4. Maybe hunter but its not as useful as a healer/tank/warlock in PvE i guess.
---
I'm skeptical about choosing warrior because I'll be fresh on this server with no gold and warriors are gear dependant, so i'll have a hard time getting gear, mount etc, but I can tank dungeons easily to level. Another point is I'll require more time invested to gear for PvE for dpsing in pve, and tanking dungeons and doing big damage in pvp. Warlock will have less competition since there's usually few warlocks in any given raid than there are of warriors/rogues competing.
---
TLDR: Warrior, shaman, warlock, or hunter on a fresh server for me (no prior gold or friends). I want the class that doesn't require a lot of time investment to get geared and do decent, I like the idea of being useful like a tank in PvE 5mans, I'd prefer healing or dpsing in raids, and I'll mainly play the characters to PvP and raid logging, in which I like classes that can do some serious damage in PvP, so ele/destro look good but warrior will require more time invested to get the gear.
---
I think the fact that they speed up DM release is a good sign but who knows.
---
Probably will hear something at blizzcon but they‚Äôll most likely combine it with retail and say they have ‚ÄúX,000,000 number of subs. Largest since 2008!!!!‚Äù So they don‚Äôt fragment the player base 
---
^and ^admit ^they ^were ^wrong
---
Idk how it‚Äôd play out in BGs but essentially yea. 
---
One set sacrifices some dmg in exchange for survivability and sustain. My world set has all my stats gear and things that will help me in the open world (carrot on a stick, spellstone if I‚Äôm expecting pvp vs casters). 
---
My shadow dmg set is my glass cannon set, it‚Äôs  mostly made up of shadow weave / shadow wrath gear. These items come with a lot of + shadow dmg but only a single or no stats. I lose around 700 hp / 400 mana (at work so sry don‚Äôt know exact numbers), but I gain about 60-70 shadow dmg over my other set.
---
Basically in the open world I rely on having high survivability through stats, and high killing power through dots / life drain. 
---
In a dungeons my main source of dmg is shadow bolt. I usually don‚Äôt use dots except on bosses, but even then ~85% of my dmg is shadow bolt. Because of this, I focus more on pumping my shadow dmg and spell crit at the cost of survivability.
---
Fuck LoL, Valve is much better. LoL only tells you if your report was the report that punished them, and it doesn't even say how.
---
it is tho. :/ i have 440 def tanking gear, its just sitting in my bank waiting and is probl never gonna be used. threat is more important in mc then def
---
No I meant that it's a 10 man with good loot but you gotta run it so many times. I did not mean only dal rends but with main being 5% you are likely to get everything before that
---
Are....we the baddies?
---
I've got a 35 rogue and a 34 warrior, I'm taking it nice and slow... I let one get about 6-7 days rested exp and I log in and enjoy myself. Then I play the other one when I get the chance and repeat the cycle on both of them.
---
Still playing a bunch of RL, a bunch of MW, spending time with the gf (we live together so thats made easier), and getting all my work done at work (jk i sit on reddit im a programmer we hardly do anything until we get close to deadlines),
---
shouldn't be hard to find groups as shadow dps. When leveling, i've never seen anyone care at all about the player's spec. I've pugged with shadow dps before and it was never an issue. Though you will be more in demand as healer than a dps obviously. 
---
When switching to shadow spec, you'll lose some mana regen and efficiency from the disc talents you're losing. But its quite common for priests to heal in shadow spec so definitely doable. 
---
Since you say you are starting to kill slower now, one reminder is to make sure your wand is up to date. This is very important.
---
This is actually a much better way of saying what you said up there and I agree with this part of the post 100%
---
Sure, just uh, slog yourself through a BRD lava run. By yourself.
---
Oh no, it's a mage.  /me pats head. It's ok buddy, we'll get you a spell other than blizzard and AE one of these days!
---
I wouldn't say it's a retail thing. It's just a modern gamer thing. Lots of gamers nowadays are very self-centered. They don't really want to do anything unless they benefit from it.
---
Question 1 is are you 60? But its only mc and ony so if you a mage or lock its cool
---
Why do you invite randoms to your guild? Do you not talk with them and figure out why they are joining and if they want to raid etc. Personal connections require two parties to participate.
---
You think you do but you don‚Äôt.
---
Zerker rage immunes seduce as well
---

---
People use flash heal to snipe and win healing meters. There's no way to distinguish good healers from amazing healers in any content that isn't progression-tier. Unless you do side-by-side comparisons replacing a slot with the healers you want to compare, and control the other variables.
---
Any specific build you use? Also ice block is nice in dungeons if I pull threat using AoE.
---
I think it's more like, when you hit 60, raiding guilds entice you with promises of Molten Core runs, but when you join the guild, you mostly get asked to run BRD, Mara, Strat, Scholo, BRS, etc..  And it turns out they don't have a spot in MC for melee dps or whatever anyway.
---
The offhand from DMN and gloves from princess are decent alternative (both better imho). I dont understand why most bis lists have atal ai gloves over the ones from Moira honestly.
---
If you went with 1 tank, 2 healers, 7 dps, if there was actual loot you needed you could farm it out super fast. Maybe even 8-9 dps, 1 healer as long as you got a tanky dps.
---
10 is pretty standard for feral tanks if the guild they're in pushes any real damage. Unless he's holding mobs for a different tank to pickup later.
---
Anyone could quit at any moment, but you can't seriously be arguing that the guild leader isn't more invested than some random member that no one knows anything about because they don't communicate. Come on now.
---
Be careful, DKP isn't a binding system you can easily get screwed over by a GM that cottons on to your ploy.
---
Say you are a priest off healer and the eye of divinity dropps, as you're ready to bid the GM might just go "Gratz main healer" not letting anyone bid on it.
---
Make sure your GM isn't reserving gear for the core group.
---
People shit on loot council for being corruptible, but DKP can be fudged as well.
---
Pretty true, i raid log on my mc ready characters because honestly why would you run useless dungeons.
---
You should be getting to know people before you guild invite them.
---
Seems like a really good post and makes me realize I should probably ask the guy who recruited me how I did on my first MC run yesterday. I also think I'm going to try to do some guild runs in dungeons even if it doesn't benefit me just to build up some of those relationships. I just like playing and think I found a good guild to move forward with so I think I should invest back in it.
---
That depends really. I'm guessing you're not an orc or human. In that case you'd always use Edgemasters for PVE anyways. Flameguard are something you'll want eventually though if you PvP.
---
The open world experience is much better than the dragon-riding one. Trust me.
---
"But let's be real if that is where you derive satisfaction and self worth then I pity you as a person" 
---

---
I don't see why you think I'm offended or feel attacked, but ok.
---
Have you considered the fact that there are way more servers now than there were at launch? That people transferred to different realms? Of course some people quit, but this narrative of a 86% drop rate is ridiculous. Especially given that blizzard refuses to give any population figures. The only ones we have is from how many people are in que.
---
If you must know, I usually only play games that people would consider "dead", most of them have less than 1k concurrent players. So by no means would classic having that few players mean anything to me. I just believe that this 90% drop off rate is ridiculous and wrong. I'd still play classic if we only had a single realm with 500 ppl on it.
---
Also most US servers might be single layer, on EU there are like 6 single layer ENG realms...
---
Going down to consecrate is totes worth especially in this new ‚ÄúAOE all the things‚Äù meta.  Also if you are leveling with a friend playing heal bot while they wreck stuff is totally viable. If you are soloing to max yes Ret it up. But if you are leveling with a friend Holy is totes viable.
---
You got a good point, I think there's no value in properly testing this. Even if you do get a few more trunks it's ultimately not a big deal.
---
I bet you got a nice rush from that kill. I know the feeling. Great playing.
---
I‚Äôm a fury warrior :3
---
Yeah, it was the gnome.
---
You have to put something in to get something out. Let the new guy figure out the social dynamics.
---
Watch past the first 20 seconds. It's just providing the background context.
---
I never understood why people want to play Alliance. You have the option to play all these interesting uniquely designed characters, and instead you play as "normal guy".
---
I love under city and think the layout is great. The zeppelins are nice but the alliance have the ships. I've had it real easy hanging in IF. Questing on alliance feels way more streamlined. Horde have to enter and leave the barrens like 3 or 4 times and it's just annoying
---
All about finding the right balance. I have a full-time job, a wife, and two kids under the age of 5. I still have a few hours each day to game.
---
Granted I barely sleep, but that's beyond the point üòÖ
---
Very valid, but I didn‚Äôt find it for sale on my server any time I looked (I had it for about 3 days). so I couldn‚Äôt really make an educated decision.  I basically compared it other cloth heads with +heating.  I found one with similar +healing that was listed at 10g, then listed it for 40 more.  Any suggestions for how to keep track of item listings?
---
&gt; If you feel cheated in a loot council guild its most likely you thats the problem. 
---
I've never been in one. Like I already mentioned, I hate that system with a passion. That said, I have friends who were in LC guilds where there were a few officers who kept all the BiS drops and handed out 2nd grade drops to people who didn't really want it...
---
Maybe I should judge the whole concept based on what I've heard about it, but then again, even with the way you described it, it's literally meant to alienate the "average player".
---
ie.: Why do "fun" players deserve better gear than "average" players? Doesn't this effectively turn raids into a popularity contest?
---
&gt; Literally every loot council guild ive been in has been more mature and fair than any dkp guild.
---
How can it be more fair than letting people earn points based on their participation and contribution, and then to let them use those points to bid on the gear they actually want, as opposed to hoping they can do a good enough impression on their guild's leadership to qualify for loot?
---
In Strath UD the tanks get the gear they need, and then never need to run it again. At least BRD theres a chance of SGC, or Strath Live has Orbs to draw tanks in. If you're a PUG DPS who needs a DPS item that a tank also wants (cape of the black baron) good luck getting that shit without a friend doing you a favor and tanking for you.
---
You‚Äôre right. But I think the demand is coming from a lot more crusader enchants. Healing power was extremely expensive before Dire Maul, and it still is very expensive. Players are getting this on one weapon, and typically not wasting the gold on a pre-BiS item. 
---
Then there‚Äôs truefaith, which needs 4.  It you‚Äôre also only making one, for yourself and never making another. Melee players will enchant a weapon with crusader, than another, and another, and another. They‚Äôll possibly have multiple weapons at one time and all of them will have crusader.
---
Selfless is probably better than Team Player.
---
That's just a good trait all around.
---
You don't need to be using 3 mcp charges on each boss as a tank. 1 charge is  more  than enough to hold threat. Also most of the boss fights last less than 1 minite.
---
Main problem with Outland is that its disconnected from the vanilla world. Would much rather have expansions be a part of the same contiguous world.
---
Helping people inevitably leads to some communication eventually and gets you a reputation as a helpful member. OP is only talking about people that are ghosts and show up on raid night expecting a raid spot and some gear.
---
Priests should use rank 2 heal. It's my most cast spell by far. However like you mentioned you dont get big boy top heal numbers being efficient.
---
If you are doing guild runs. Maybe have a priest meeting where you all come together on a cohesive strategy. In pugs I dunno it's hard to say, do you I guess. Putting out numbers is one thing. I like to have a little mana on hand to make big plays when shit goes south.
---
Imo big plays &gt; big numbers.
---
You know the BRE grant yourself a buff to ignore armour, not a debuff on the target right? Its armour ignore applies only your own own attacks. 
---
I only mention this as your wording implies that having one would benefit the raid.
---
Why skulls?
---
To me, everytime I hear Loot Council, I immediately think "funnel the GM and officers first council"
---
I know it's likely not true, but I can't separate the two. Maybe I've just never been in a legitimate LC guild.
---
I've been dual boxing a shammy with my lvl 60 fury warrior. you should be able to do clear dungeons up to ZF extremely efficiently with the mage pulling big packs and aoeing them down. I've already done this with a priest up to 50, added the shammy for windfury and chain lightning. 50+ though, I dont know yet.
---
My Rogue is only 36 at this stage but fully rested so I'm planning to rush to 40 soon. I'm fully into combat so I don't think I could go back to *miss miss miss miss* so I'll wait until I can try your spec with the 5% hit chance talent kept.
---
An elderly player is not going to be doing "spellcleave" groups. Especially not on a Paladin; those groups are typically just 4 mages and a Priest.
---
You should not be a "heal bot" while leveling, since there's so little healing to be done while fighting regular mobs.
---
As someone who has played Paladin inside and out in patch 1.12, there's no reason at all to level as Holy. Even if you level 100% of the time with a friend, you should still be Ret.
---
Might be a Wowhead bug, that happens sometimes. I'll reach out to them and report the bug.
---
Honestly they wouldn't do that unfortunately. They're gonna put 100% of new content focus on retail. And splitting the playerbase like that wouldn't really work either
---
Thanks for posting this.
---
I just wanted to add that this mindset isnt for everybody. Theres no perfect way to run a guild but at least this guild is taking care of its people.
---
Hello there! Great to have you as part of our community. I'd go with a priest myself if I were you, all you'll have to do really is shield/heal yourself and use a wand to kill monsters, very efficient and effective! And if a nasty rogue attacks you and you panic, psychic stream should do the trick! (Except against those pesky undead).
---
most dps are morons in this game, it has been this way in pservers but a bit more on blizz classic. I would be more assertive tho, but a good choice on leaving. I personally would ask for the lead and kick the mage.
---
I cant actually tell if you're being serious
---
If people aren't willing to hop on comms and attempt to make friends, they're not really worth the investment. It is not at all hard to hop on comms outside of raid and say hey what's up, or just lurk until there's a conversation you feel comfortable jumping in on if you're shy af.  People are complaining about OP's guild treating people as disposable DPS, when they are literally just that, disposable dps that you can find another of in a heartbeat. So why bother going out of your way to try to make the person stay when they put forth no effort to even get to know anyone in the guild? You'll eventually find people willing to hang out and do shit with other people and have a core 40+. 
---
The other side of that is that the guild members need to make sure they're not being super cliquey on comms when someone new does jump on and they engage with that person rather than just continuing conversations about injokes and shit.  It's really just minimum effort from both parties that's required.  
---
I do think the random invites at raid time is a bad look though as just having signups isn't difficult and a couple people who don't mind being around as backup at least know their position going into the raid.
---
Ouch
---
Don't listen to that scrub. Ppl who only live to insult your pvp efforts deserve the paddle.  I enjoyed the clip!
---
Do you get good xp doing that or do you need to fill the rest of the group up by offering runs?
---
No we wont wtf... most of our BiS (not even preraid bis, but actual bis) for phase 1 isnt plate.
---
There's only one anvil but there's a second smelter right as the road splits to the other smelter/anvil. Not that much more convenient
---
Faerlina?
---
I gotta start advertising to help people through BRD on my 60. I love that dungeon and have happily done it since I was 54.
---
Oh no my sweet boy lay your forehead upon your palm for you have been bamboozled from toe to tip.
---
yeah except for cleave/HS you then lose more rage from cleave/hs taking up you white hit rage generation. For tanking, it mostly evens out unless you are rage capped in which case faster is better.
---
&gt; Power leveling totally works to an extent 
---
Not really, the exp per hour is better solo grinding than it is having a high level help you. It's even better if you just spam dungeons in a group of similar leveled players. It may be easy to have a high level run you through dungeons, but it is not better exp per hour than other options.
---
I'm aware and I see what you mean. Both are great options for different reasons.
---
Found the dogshit healer lol
---
&gt; How much healing ability am I giving up if I respec to Shadow? Will I still be able to heal 5-man dungeons through to 60? My main group does not have another healer that could take my place.  
---
Healing will be a little tougher on you, but you'll still be able to heal dungeons on the way to 60 as shadow.  
---
&gt; How hard is it for Shadow Priests to find PUGs as a DPS? Will I be able to put out respectable damage compared to the more traditional DPS classes? I'm not super concerned with raids, at least not for a while.  
---
You will likely be asked if you can heal or dps. You would do yourself and the group a favor by being flexible and taking the role that is needed for the group. If you are stubborn, then it will just take longer to get the group formed and going.  
---
&gt; How much faster/easier will my solo questing get if I respec to Shadow? How big is the damage increase? How much potential am I giving up if I don't respec?  
---
Leveling as a shadow priest is much easier than discipline if you are solo. If you frequently group up for quests and other content, the spec doesn't matter as much.
---

---
The true rage cost of Heroic Strike is 15 + the rage generated from one AA swing which is lower for faster weapons so fast weapons are better for Heroic Strike spam.
---
I got Earthshaker last night.
---
Today I ran UBRS with a group and used it. That thing is actually bonkers in UBRS with its proc rate. Helped out a ton on the big packs of 5+ elites.
---
And of course, looking forward to PvPing on it.
---
What‚Äôs the purpose of this macro?
---
Well done video, I'm glad you at least acknowledge that you're not good at it "forget everything at my disposal" lol. 
---
Pvp is mixed bag, maybe you like maybe you don't. I love it. Just being a part of the world. Once battlegrounds are out at least there's some semblance of practice. 
---
If you see a shaman though who looks even sorta geared, run.
---
Until you cant find a tank for 2 hours because they have absolutely no reason being there besides gold. If you can easily find a tank, than it‚Äôs a friend/guild run willing to help others, that‚Äôs not the same as forming a PUG. I prefer reserving one for the tank, and then roll for the rest. I wouldn‚Äôt join the run advertised either, but I‚Äôve seen this exact same ad before on my server. Why? Because people join and others profit.
---
And you know this based on the vast amount of experience you have doing what exactly? Because it looks to me you're talking right out of your asshole. 
---
Feral tanks can hold threat at MT, but unlike warriors where they can just put more threat gear on, ferals can consume more mcp charges as a threat boost. 
---
Saying 1 charge is enough period is just ignorant, any fury warrior in consumables and good gear could hit a lucky string of crits and pull. 
---
Any guild trying to speed clear won't be very pleased when a feral tank comes with 5 mcp's.
---
Please no I already forget to use 99% of my spells as it is
---
This x1000.
---
Theorycrafters put furyprot at taking on average 40 percent MORE damage on the warrior than a deep prot build. In most cases it simply is not worth it in raids. 5 mans you can make an excuse for using it if you really want to, but in raids it only becomes viable if your top dps is pulling aggro off of you.
---
gottem
---
You can do it as combat but you'll be making less gold. I go hemo for the stealth speed, prep, elusiveness, and then throw a 3 piece nightslayer bonus for -30s on vanish CD.
---
Ah, then yea, I would avoid trying to set up AoE farm shenanigans and just roll with whatever gels well with her playstyle. Since she's the damage, you will likely be her tank and heals, so I would actually not worry too much about going Ret. Start with something Prot'ish, like [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sxVzZV0xI), then branch out from there depending on what you guys end up doing the most. 
---
To put it into perspective, my wife is trying out WoW and she's definitely not a gamer. That said, my original assumptions about what she would like to do (backline-y stuff: healing, maybe ranged DPS) were wrong. She decided on a Druid (she likes animals), and loves to stay in bear all day and tank things. So when we play together, I stick to healing and some dps.
---
No... you're extrapolating from my point. I didn't say anything about someone who afk/auto-attacked every boss. If you're a raid leader, which you said you are, it's your job to notice these things and kick people from the raid who are under-performing. 
---
It is in my opinion though, that it is not your job to decide who "needs" a piece of gear more than someone else. If someone isn't helping, or is generally useless then kick them.
---
Personally I won't join a raid group (pug or guild) if I don't get an opportunity for the loot I want, and I don't think you should expect anyone to. No one wants to spend 2-3hours raiding, with no chance of gear/loot.
---
Its massive. At least for raids.
---
I was just talking about this with a friend today. 
---
Let me ask him tonight where he gets the info. 
---
I don‚Äôt think the character transfer let‚Äôs you choose servers.
---
Alliance? Really? Hahahahaha ü§ó
---
Like heroin?
---
Lmaooo trust me it‚Äôs really not
---
Well the problem I see is selflessness. No one wants to help the whole. Sure dps hunter you got your shit, how about reciprocating for the healer that's gonna ensure you get that sweet loot from MC.
---
Get a 2nd sub and run your self through dm, then stocks, sm gy, sm lib and sm cath. All up to 37 then ZF GY runs up until your not getting exp. 
---
By then your ready to start doing attunement/BiS quests and start the gear grind.
---
Also to anyone saying you don't get good experience I tracked my experience the entire way up and I never once got less experience than I would have solo grinding solo questing or doing group dungeons. Having a level 60 with you especially something like a mage helps immensely the portals are huge
---
TIL if you don‚Äôt need on gear you can‚Äôt use you‚Äôre just a scrub playing by self imposed rules. Teach us your ways, oh enlightened one!
---
Yeah I think castsequence doesn't work with On Use items, only spells from what I remember. I'll try it later when I have time.
---
\- OEB
---
\- Onslaught
---
\- Essence of the Firelord
---
\- Gauntlets of Might

\- Bracers of Might

\- Flameguard gauntlets

\- Ony head
---
\-Eskhanders collar
---
So pretty much 50/50 between "worthless" items and brutal BiS
---
Well that was a nail biter. Great job
---
You have no pre-signs and no pre-confirmed roster spots and no bench system in place, of course its going to be a shitfiesta every time you're gonna raid. Get a pre-sign system on discord, there's a few great bots for it that you only have to install and give permissions to; then have people pre-sign so you have a idea of how many people are coming and what not. Then confirm who is coming the day before the raid is scheduled for, also assign people to bench.
---
Have raiders+bench be online at 30 mins before raid time and give them attendance points for being there. Benchers can go offline if they're not needed, we give our benchers prio raidspots for next week and they can find pugs for this week. Everyone is fine with this system because they know beforehand whether they're in the raid or not. For the benched people we have 2 guild pugs so they never have to stray too far away from the guild..
---
Your loot council sounds like they're there to gear themselves and their friends, and besides that they have no idea what they're doing if your loot distribution is so top heavy and newcomers don't get anything until they've "proven themselves". I'm gonna guess your guild doesn't have any clear pathways for the newcomers to prove themselves. We have a clear list on what is needed to become a raider and our class leaders actively guide new people on how to reach those goals.
---
We run 2 raids with loot council and have a public list with loot prios for classes so that everyone knows which class is getting the next item and for what reason. We don't include player names in the public list because it creates unnecessary drama. We also have posts up on our discord describing on what we take into account when giving out loot (attendance/performance/preparation only in our case and in that order - no personal feelings here or you get one of those shit loot councils that only give loot to friends). Having some transparency is great, it builds trust between raiders and leaders. Without any transparency the raiders will feel like they're being used, which should not be the case in any decent guild. A decent guild should be a fun place to play in, first and foremost. Your current systems do the exact opposite.
---
TLDR: Your guild's leadership sucks - if you're a part of that leadership, go look in a mirror or if you're a raider, swap guilds because the guild you're in atm is gonna fall apart quickly unless there's drastic changes (which don't tend to happen because shitty leaders have lots of ego and they're not the problem, its always the raiders).
---
Hahaha what the fuck
---
Winterspring Felguards are great for farming.
---
- 10-30silver per kill  
---
- Good green drops  
---
- Felcloth  
---
- Demonic Runes (great for raids)  
---
- Eye of Shadow  
---
- Runecloth   
---
Mages are one of the few classes that can kill them easily, and it's very possible as AP+Frost.
---
&gt; amazing community
---
&gt; only other comment is /u/eggyboi shit talking your ui
---
"meat mage"
---
Regardless, they sell for 50g on my server.  No amount of gear will amount to winning even one of those orbs.  That being said, you‚Äôre right. I wouldn‚Äôt join this group as the only reason many players would still even run Strat live is for the gold potential it has.
---
I got killed about 4 or 5 times. Managed to put the egg in the keg by rezzing on top of it. Then threw one stink bomb per rez. It was fun to me, but I was also pretty stoned.
---
Show me some deep arms raid DPS parses. If they are remotely comparable with their fury counterparts, I'll happily edit my comments and hit you with some gold.
---
cries in cape of the black baron baron 
---
ud strath is a long run and lots of classes need this cape ;/ ive lost it a few times.  I could put the groups together yada yada yada but id rather just join one or do one with my guild and i'm not going to restrict classes / reserve in a guild run lol
---
Came here to say this. Glad that other people know.
---
Go to 50s leveling spots if you want to be a dick.
---
not really. prot is just better threat than fury/prot when you have very little hit/crit gear cause shield slam can‚Äôt be parried. 
---
I just think giving rag shield to a warrior instead of paladin/shaman for PvP is asinine when drillborer is completely usable for any situation that demands a shield
---
Why would you call van cleef's instance dire maul?
---
Confirmed this adds up to about 36 days of /played.
---
The game has only been out for about 64 days.
---
This means an average of **13.5 hours a day** playing WoW classic.
---
Dude...
---
Well if he can't generate enough aggro he should be using different gear and mcp.i tank with 9% hit chance and have no aggro issues.
---
Perhaps, but they seemed pretty confident that the main target of the fireballs was the MT each time. I'll be keeping a close eye on it tonight.
---
Stonetalon is in the north of the zone and it sucks, desolace is in the northeast edge of the zone and it sucks, feralas is on an island far out to sea to the west of feralas, there is a boat that is so slow that it is still faster to swim to it, there is an alliance flight point and three npcs on the border between feralas and thousand needles, stv there is an alliance camp without a flight point in the north and booty bay, hinterlands there is a base with like 4 quests in in the north west of the zone.
---
WITH MACROS OU CAN HAVE AT LEAST 2 SPELLS BOUND PER KEY
---
Be visible and useful outside of raids. Be active in your class/healer/role channels. Show up consistently. Advertise your profession services to your guildies at discount. 
---
Also, understand that a good LC wants to build a consistent raid and should be giving some items to new players to keep them interested. 
---
For MC, the strategic loot is pretty narrow since the raids are easy. It basically means the MT is going to get his 3 piece first, and that people who are on the cusp of a sweet set bonus will be given higher priority than your 2/8.
---
Two 15 agi enchants makes dual wield better. Assuming they are in the game???
---
It tends to be true for stuff like the first t2 drops. It's in the raids best interest long-term to gear everyone kinda evenly. MC and Ony are 20 manable, but BWL and on will require 40 at least at 1st. 40 well-geared people at that to be able to successfully do the content. So any guilds only gearing up the same 12-20 people will be shooting themselves in the foot long run.
---
As a fellow druid who isn't great at PVP, running away and healing is super easy as a druid. I haven't gotten successfully ganked yet and I'm 42
---
yup.
---
Guess the stairwell was 2Deep
---
If you think that you just never got an offer generous enough.
---
When I joined my server it was a clean slate, relatively even in population. Now, everywhere I go I'm surrounded by horde that outnumber me 3:1. To be honest, I've just /bowed and spared the lone quester too many times only to be stabbed in the back and ganked on repeat as reward for my tolerance and I'm just tired of playing that way. Zones are so packed now with no layering that I can't even defend myself without more horde jumping on me if I do manage to get the upper hand. When I kill low level toons it's not for fun, and it's not some shitty ego thing either, it's because I don't want them reaching max level on a server that already has a population problem.
---
Could play a game that isnt multiplayer.
---
man idk i was leveling my druid then my mage buddy was like "come to deadmines" and he wiped it a few times and holy hell did i level fast during that hour
---
Man you sound like the most pretentious douche I pity the people that have to be around you. Thinking that you are better then people who are playing a pvp game and participating in valid pvp that you dont like. And here you are trying to sound smart and mature like "I'm a mature adult I dont participate in that Tom foolery any more, I feel bad for these children who just dont understand how precious adult time is". Not realizing that you just sound like an idiot who doesnt realize he is arguing about an rpg and not the ethics of war. Some day you are actually going to mature and realize how dumb your thinking was at this age and time.  
---
If you didnt care about this you wouldnt have responded to the post. But you needed everyone to know that you're a big kid now and that you morally superior to those dumb edgy teen gankers.
---
Best part is you can still report the name of the person doing it.  It just stops the pop up
---

He definitely wanted to kill him, but he just sucked too much dick to actually get the job done. Nice shit OP.

How did everyone level from 58-60? I just dinged 58 last night and still have a bunch of quests available in WPL and EPL. But I've seen people say they did most of it in dungeons also. Which is more efficient and recommended? I don't have any pre-bis items yet. 
---
Also, I'm at 315g right now. How does that compare? I want to get my epic mount asap and my profs are alch/herb. Should I also be lasher farming?
---
Just download questie.  It marks the location of all available quests that you haven't done yet on your map.
---
TELL US IF YOU LOOKED AT THE IMAGE
---
Sounds like a pretty lame guild if you have people like that in your guild to begin with.
---
Play a warlock, so much room for error you can jack off to yourself when someone ganks you and still be done in time to kill them
---
Ty for the help
---
Considering spirit tap doesn't work u must be a god
---
Gf

To be fair. It's fairly easy to focus the wrong target as DPS if your tank isnt marking. I usually give a 3 second count and start hitting the most threatening Target or a healer. If I pull aggro after 2-3 attacks, I'll run them back to you but don't bitch about me. I'm focusing you and using Target of my Target. You just decided to switch targets without marking and frankly it's excessive for me to have to check who you are targeting between every single attack.
---
I help hordies *all the time* and often get recognized by them and emoted at.
---
I also mercilessly camp gankers until they log.
---
These are not mutually exclusive things. You cool with me? I'm cool with you. You start shit? I will end your play session.
---
they are both solid choices, but I would highly recommend a lock if you like PVP.  Depending on what spec you go you have tons of options with playstyle and when you get good gear you are really, really hard to kill.  I used to PVP/Raid quite a bit in BC and whatever the expansion after that was and I never got tired of it.  If your teaming with a Shadow priest you'll have crazy amounts of fears, dots, you can SS them, etc.  Mages are great as well, but locks are super fun.
---
Lets you toggle your ice block off if you already have ice block on, with the same button!
---
This is also the thought process when a BoE pattern or something drops that I am interested in giving to a guildie.  First options are people I have a relationship with, 2nd option is people who demonstrate a commitment to the guild by helping others, and 3rd option is for folks who have at least demonstrated some commitment and are not likely to gquit.  Honestly, i would often prefer to AH the pattern/recipe rather than give it to a brand new random guildie nobody knows for free.  If I‚Äôm giving away a Pattern: Mithril Spurs, I want trust that the ability to craft them will be available in the future, and that trust takes time and effort.
---
I would go imp coa over cow. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll use either much at all in raiding, though
---
A lot of guilds use discord for raid organization. You gotta plan your composition so you don't end up with too many of the same class. You plan raid times. You see who's attuned and who needs help attuning. Who has the waters to do majordomo and ragnaros? It's not simply for chatting and hanging out sometimes. And if someone is so against discord they aren't gonna bother helping leaders organize, why should they help you get loot?  
---
Every guild is different though. YMMV
---
You can double tap it to ice block and remove ice block. It's great for removing a debuff instantly
---
Lmfao look at this badass over here
---
That was simply their plan: release servers in small batches and don't release more until the current ones have sufficient pop. They did not make an attempt to simultaneously release all the servers that they thought they'd need.
---
I just carefully pull. Even if the healer is at 10% mana, if you can pull singles then your healer can just drink through the entire combat. Of course this doesn't work in every situation. For example, if you don't have anyone snaring or you have an ADHD frost mage running laps around you, or other extenuating circumstances.
---
*laughs in druid*
---
Awesome thanks for the input. 
---
Yeah I didn't choose druid to top meters, I chose it because I wanted to be able to both tank and heal end game. 
---
So far I'm really liking it, especially post-40 with all the new skills you get.
---
I still haven't decided if late end game I want to try and OT or heal, but I like having a choice at least.
---
You might be right. But how big is that 3rd group. I would never say that classic will die..... It will just lose 80% of its players. Idk how many people were on Nost but I would guess it will be that number + a few
---
It casts and cancels ice block with the same button.
---
Go to Thunder Bluff. The AH and bank are just a few steps from the forge and anvil. 
---
That said, I've made the trip from the bank to the blacksmith's tools way too many times myself. I can't seem to end up in TB when I want to grind engineering.
---
Do what I did. Recruit 1 druid and 3 more rogues and stealth to the end of the instance just to kill the boss. Took us like 10 minutes.
---
amen
---
Not the person you ask but my final build will be 11/0/40 with winter's chill.
---
However this isn't the optimal dps spec for raiding. You would have far more points in arcane.
---
I see a lot of people doing Strat Live runs reserving orbs for the tank.
---
I massively outgear the place so how exactly is this done? Do I throw on masterlooter and then just have people /roll for greens til an orb drops? That seems kinda messy and slow.
---
Haha yeah man I know I‚Äôm bad. But looking to get better the more I PvP. You‚Äôre right I think PvP adds a lot. Sure it can be annoying at times but I guarantee without it it wouldn‚Äôt be as enjoyable. 
---
I heard about battlegrounds. Really looking forward to that.
---
It‚Äôs a gnome, just kill it, put it out if it‚Äôs misery
---
Well done!
---
Just kill the mob.  You need it for a quest and he's being a bitch about taming it.  You both need it, but for a different reason.  If he's that tied to having it as a pet he can wait another 5 minutes for it to spawn.
---
Why would I tip first, I don‚Äôt know the value of what‚Äôs inside my box yet. I tip 50% of what I get.
---
i've now run into an issue where my guild will be raiding sat and sun but during the week i'd rather level my alliance alts (horde war main) so i can't partake in the guild during the week
---
well i can but i cbf. i think i'll need to start doing that as my dps is pretty shit - the guild brings in puggers so i still have a space w/ my shit dps (im prot spec as dungeons are a bitch to pug)
---
They still ban gold buyers?
---
&gt; The other side of that is that the guild members need to make sure they're not being super cliquey on comms when someone new does jump on and they engage with that person rather than just continuing conversations about injokes and shit. 
---
This is a really good point!
---
I spent like 5 years playing locks and would highly recommend.  Super fun and lots of different ways to play depending on what you enjoy.
---
That's the hard truth
---
Ok most guides don't mention this for some reason but it's easily the biggest plus of the farm in my opinion. The DM:E lashers are very easily soloable in the fully efficient arcane power raid spec. Just get the route down and do 1-2 packs at a time. Group them, freeze, flamestrike (double if you have PoM up), CoC, arcane explosion and they are just about one shot. I figured this out after someone told me you didn't need to be in frost and then I picked up herbalism just for this. I make about 50g/hr consistently with herb probably about 30g/hr without. Your runs will normally take less than 12 minutes so set a timer and you may need to afk a bit at the end once you get the hang of it. I never die. High int/stam gear is a plus.
---
Just level fast. You won‚Äôt be needing those lol
---
Eh. Arguably. We‚Äôre mostly in the dark about it - and help assassinate a corrupt noble, too.
---
I'm actually european (just used US minimum wages), from a country where the hourly minimum wage for unskilled labor is about $3. so... holy shit.
---
It doesn't sound like they are taking care of new people at all
---
Weakness is ok in PvP but I don't really see the application in raids because it'll be such a drop in the bucket on big mobs hitting tanks, I doubt the raid would care for that over other debuffs considering the debuff limit. You'll be using your resistance deduction curses the most, I imagine.
---
That being said... some people join guilds specifically to raid. Can't always force the social aspect on some people. Nothing wrong with showing up and doing your job right, and logging off once it's over. You signed up to raid.
---
Imagine being that guy and losing a BiS drop to the guildie who's "a little drunk/high", forgets to show up on-time with his pots and enchants, dies more than you/does less dps than you, but gets the gear handed to him because he's a tad bit more social around the loot council. Yeah, most people would be a little pissed and if given the opportunity, they'd jump ship to another guild that's willing to discuss loot beforehand. Guild politics can get annoying, same way that office politics will promote people who are shittier workers but are able to crack jokes around the boss.
---
I'm sure you run your guild well, but if you're taking anyone in without explaining this to them, you can expect a few nasty whispers from these disgruntled players.
---
Okay I lost it, you win the comment of the day.
---
I hated that system until I was both in a loot council guild and part of the council.
---
It's a decent way to gear core members. Furthermore, it ensures a leveled progress because people aren't passing on an upgrade to horde dkp for that rare upgrade. Less manipulation of the system.
---
The only way they accessed your account is if they logged in from one of your machines or they somehow compromised your mobile device. In which case you may have way bigger problems than your WoW account. More likely honesty is someone with access to your personal computer did it.
---
I forgot to add, dont stop doing "arena" runs until you get banthok sash it is a belt with hit and spellpower. Not only is it an amazing belt for raiding, but that hit is nice for leveling too.
---
OMG, was this in original wow also?
---
[try this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv-CRoz8hKM) 
---
note: private server stuff, so I'm not sure it'll work like this, haven't had a chance to test it out.
---
Yeah, I would never ever play in a loot council guild. A transparent dkp system (or variants) are the best. With some rules to prevent completely stupid shit like people using dkp just for roleplaying when items are good for other classes.
---
It's way easier to justify playing WoW, at least financially. only $15 a month vs. like the $100-120 a gram which lasts like a day or two
---
This one definitely wont be happening, I spend way too long camping people in STV to level fast
---
What you need is a raid roster.
---
I think there was a lot of sentiment before release that after a month or 2 people would get bored and quit
---

Everquest had a nifty strat for pl. If you you spammed soothe/harmony (threat reduction) you could wipe the threat table eventually. So you could get a really high lvl mob and get it to like 2 hap and spam soothe. A low lvl could do the 2 damage and get full credit for kill. I dont think there is a way to do that in wow.
---
I have reported him on several occasions, but the bot lives on. Probably because it is being paid for by a player. 
---
Are Bots legal, can I we all start running them like this one?
---
You mean the people that probably put in double the time of an average raider. That organize the raid usually lead the raid while out performing the average raider in performance. What assholes for making sure the core is geared before the fringe. With that being said it can be worse he me MT raid lead in a joint guild weekly run. So fucking frustrating handing might gear I don‚Äôt have to the 4th warrior tank because he rolled better. Needless to say I‚Äôm ready for guild runs just so my effort doesn‚Äôt go to hearing another guilds tanks.
---
Glad I'm not in your guild. Sounds like your typical cliquey type of guild that over recruits. You're handling this all wrong. First of all it was fairly common for people to only log in during raid time back in classic through bc/wotlk because there wasn't a whole lot to do outside of their weekly farming obligations once they had gear. The fact that members don't log in to do content they don't need doesn't mean they're a bad guild member.
---
Second, loot council makes no sense when the content is this easy. It only exists to serve the in group guilds members at the expense of everyone else.
---
Third you have too many people in your guild if people leave regularly because they don't get a raid spot. You should have established core slots, and back up slots, and verify with people before hand if they are okay with this. You're wasting a lot of peoples time by recruiting them in the first place if they stand no chance of getting a raid spot without sucking up to the core guild members first.
---
Fourth. IF it was so easy to demonstrate the value of being a team player then people wouldn't just abandon your guild when they didn't get a raid spot. People play the game to play the game. In all likely hood you're being biased and misleading, so I can't really blame people for not wanting to dedicate weeks of their time sucking up to you just for a small chance at getting into a raid and obtaining some gear.
---
Surprised hunter isn‚Äôt higher, and all these pala mentions. Nothing could be simpler than sending in your pet, autoshooting, and healing pet every now and again. I‚Äôm sure old timers would love having a battle buddy with them too. Even simple bots can play hunters. 
---
Hunter isn‚Äôt low skill ceiling, but it certainly offers the choice to play very casually. Definitely recommend them.
---
It fits the fantasy genre and was maybe a decision by the translation team. I assume it hasn't been much different with voice lines in the RTS titles. Fantasy in germany is informed by culture from the medival times, so I guess they based it on that.
---
Loot Council does not have to be just a few guys at the top making decisions about people who have no input.
---
When I raided back in Vanilla, we also used Loot Council, but it was administrative rather than dictatorial; essentially a case of "the buck stops here" for final decisions. The loot council itself was comprised of guild leadership, officers and class leads. Classes would have their own channels and discuss amongst themselves outside of raid who needed what, where the most beneficial impact could be made for particular drops for specific raiders and generally knew, way ahead of time, the pecking order for a particular drop.
---
This lead, 90% of the time, to no discussion (in raid) about who should get a particular drop but simply a "gratz &lt;player X&gt;" from everyone who might actually have a stake as soon as the loot was linked, quick confirmation in officer chat and the loot being dished out.
---
Anything that wasn't that sought after would be tossed out as "any one want &lt;item Y&gt;?" and either a quick discussion on whether there were circumstances where this gear would be specifically needed by someone for a specific raid task, communicating that intention and asking for issues to be brought up, or simply throwing it open to rolls.
---
There are many ways that DKP can be unfair for newer players joining established guilds, and equally as many ways that it can incentivise behaviour that sees people hoarding DKP for contested rolls and passing up real upgrades.
---
There are pros and cons to both systems, and it ultimately comes down to the people involved and not necessarily one system being better than the other.
---
Take a week or two off man. The game has only been live for 2 months.
---
The dkp variant you use is bad then. I have never seen an item go to waste because people are saving for a better item.
---
Personally, I would run dungeons to 60, then after I'm 60 continue those quests you have because the XP you no longer get from quest completion turns into extra gold. 
---
If you don't have any pre-bis items yet, it's unlikely you're able to farm lashers yet. It's recommended to have at least 6k mana to kill a pack of them. 
---
You should have epic mount in no time just collecting herbs and questing and running dungeons at 60 if you don't buy anything fancy.
---
What's the point of the post exactly beside you crying for attention?
---
Instead of overloading you with a ton of addons, some of which are super complex (don't recommend elvui to a beginner that's never used addons guys....seriously...I'm a diehard elvui fan, but that's overkill and overwhelming).  I'm going to recommend just two that have are light weight and have a ton of quality of life improvements for you:  Leatrix Plus and Leatrix Maps

Why are you having threat issues on Domo? Not being snarky, trying to understand the mechanics of other roles better.

Skinning if youre still leveling. Herb if you‚Äôre at 60.

I don‚Äôt know how you get addicted to this game I‚Äôm struggling to stay engaged I love the Warcraft series but the slow grind is so boring. Run to this place now fly to this place now kill ten of these. I was so damn bored I play like every three days now.. pretty sad. How do I get back into this?!? Night elf hunter (for the lore) my favourite class and race combo beside Tauren but they aren‚Äôt Alliance :(
---
How exactly do you have Aux and TSM setup so they are playing nicely together?  I love TSM's tooltip info, but I vastly prefer Aux for actual auctioning because I can't be arsed to set everything up in nice groups, and the default auction action isn't always how I want to auction things....i'd rather do it manually on the fly.
---
Lock picker looking for work near the bank? Open your eyes my dude!
---
Depends. Sometimes xp isn't the reason you are running a dungeon. If a group is over leveled the xp is going to be tiny or non existent. At the same time, accidently pulling in that situation probably isn't a wipe. It really comes down to just needing to play smart and be flexible. If your party is able to skip then skip. If you have someone who's a lower level and will probably pull no matter what they do then just fight it. It's always faster to just fight than it is to have to corpse walk or res, rebuff, and drink. People turning off their brains is the problem.
---
Your way could work in theory but I think mage would keep taking aggro.
---
Uh, yea. They already ran every dungeon like 20x for pre bis. They have designated raid nights. They have consumes to farm outside of designated raid nights.
---
Well usually if your not social your also not getting in guild groups for pbis. So your just hanging out doing your own thing not contributing to the overall success of the guild. But you‚Äôll get mad first time your benched.
---
This is a very popular bot farming spot, there were some videos on this sub (not with particular player but others).

Many ppl and guides say flash heal is the nub way of healing and predicting when to pop greater heal combined with renew spam is the way to be. I have no idea I have never done a raid in my life that's just what I read.
---
I really appreciate you taking the time to write all that out! Incredibly useful information and I've glanced back at this more than a few times over the last day or so. Another question for you, as I'm approaching 50 should I go after Mirah's? I was lucky enough to land Bloodrazor and have been using that in my main hand with thrash blade in the off-hand. Also I'm debating enchanting it and wnder if you think that's worth while. Was considering the Crusader even though its roughly 50gld on my srver right now.

I really don't understand this. Why not just loot and let them have the leather after? You're gain nothing from not looting except for a few people who don't respond well to unreasonable people messing with you. Is your answer really "just because"?

It's not really like heroin, the point was only to make a joke.

I disagree on Robe of the Void, it's not worth it in my opinion. Just have a tailor make a Robe of Winter Night instead.

When you say tiers you mean that you've as a guild decided 'tiers' of items right? As in Mana Cord would be top tier, but Seal of the Arch would be lower? Or do you mean literally tier gear? Also how do you handle tier gear?
---
We've been doing open rolls so far in my guild, but we're getting to a point where more and more people are getting sick of it, and the officers have been racking our brains about what we should impliment.
---
simply not true
---
There are guilds raiding daily between 6pm and 12pm. Some guilds start later than others. Then you have weekend guilds that raid only on the weekends. I am not even talking about the pugs that go into Ony/MC. Of course there are less people online at like 2am because it's 2am. Majority of the players are sleeping/ working in the morning. I am not sure why people are setting unrealistic expectations. It's not a problem. It's a private server expectation.
---
Wait till you get to 60. When you‚Äôre 60 [gf] turns into [wife] and if you fail the quest you lose half of your gold and have to start the quest chain allover again.
---
You can solo the quest but the rewards aren‚Äôt as great and you don‚Äôt get the mount, or in my case you could 3 man it by having a healer out of your LOS healing the escort NPC.
---
Just Roll Need on all the orbs you are entitled to, everyone else should be passing or rolling greed.  The party wont risk losing the tank midway through the run over an orb, if it was agreed to give him the first or all of them.

Half expected Skyrim meme

Raiding as a tank is pretty fucking impossible. Trust me, I tried to do just that. Ended up as a fury dps

So I'm a rogue, and recently aquired Aged Core Leather Gloves. (I'm a dagger rogue ofcourse!) I got 10 hit chance at the moment, is that too much it for me now? since I got 5+ dagger skill?

Also, is there any use the muggers belt? and get 10+ dagger skill? or is that not worth it? thanks for replying!
---
I think 25 was a pretty sweet spot when I raided tbc/wotlk. Ten mans put too much restrictions on what classes are ok to take.

---
Minimum is 15 kills per week to qualify for honor gain.
---
After that, it's on a scaling system with around 1% getting the maximum and then down from there.
---
This is why those who are shooting for the highest ranks need to play so much, because you have to play more than everyone else.  The decay is so high for top tier players that if they don't get in the 1% they will lose rank instead of gaining it.
---
This is also why the top pvp players or those shooting for the top ranks will often collude to reduce the playtime.  If no one is playing more than 10 hours a day, you only have to play 11 to get R14.  Additionally, ranks are both binary and not.  The top players will look at current ranks and assign honor caps for each week.  When done right, it maximizes ranking up for everyone while saving sanity.  When done wrong, it leads to 18+ hour grind fests for weeks where you have to keep playing because there are assholes who are holding R14 and the top spots for weeks at a time.
---
Good analysis. It's a bit different on the horde side because we don't have paladins but in my experience, priests mostly use heals (R2-R3). Just precasting and canceling until burst damage happens. I don't really check healing meters on trash, and  do just fine on boss fights without flash heals.
---
If I've had to do X or Y instance 50+ times for loot, you better believe I'm never going in there again after I got what I need.
---
The only time that's ever scummy is if someone has a deal to cooperatively farm a few items with friends.
---
Flash of light max rank is good for healing most of MC since you never go oom anyway. Especially if you have stat heavy gear instead of using "of healing" greens and such.
---
A 60 running Princess runs can do 2-3 in an hour. Burn an hour once a week to help out lowbies get BiS so you can raid better. Also it doesn't have to be one person, it can be multiple. 
---
WHOAAAA Helping out guild members is part of being a guild, crazzzzyyy
---
A copypasta from 3 and a half years ago with 5 likes. Wow. 
---
You pserver players really have a victim complex
---
Well, as a rogue you sort of have to open when the guy is fighting mobs. Attacking full-life enemy is most of the time suicide. If you don't kill during the stun phase, it's game over for the rogue.
---
Anyway point is there are ways to pl. But you gotta be creative with tags, threat table, neutral damage/healing and evasion mechanics.
---
 Prob easier to do quests.
---
dont tell me, tell him. i have the macro, i just wasnt at my pc

This makes me sad then hahaüòìüòÇ

You finally admitted it.

Again, there is nothing wrong with killing someone who is a lower level than you are. I'm talking about the sport of griefing players. I really do pity what a small and worthless sense of self you must feel on a day to day basis where this is the big highlight of your time spent.
---
I feel true pity for your family that they have to look into the eyes of their husband and father and feign admiration.

Guy I know who‚Äôs pretty heavy in this game says the rate is about 5 gold per dollar. He has a guy who lives in an economically struggling country farm about 50g per hour for him, and for that guy $10 USD per hour is more than he could make in his country but he obviously only gets a cut and not the full amount. I don‚Äôt think anyone is getting close to making $17+ an hour farming gold. But it‚Äôs obviously more appealing for people who would make less than say $7USD/hour in their economy. Not sure if the $430 for 1000 gold is accurate because I‚Äôve heard differently from a source I trust.
---
I'm gonna be honest man, the /s seems pretty implied to me
---
I‚Äôve only played a paladin for 14 years. Played all through the beta. Seen 5 of our paladins in guild level holy because that‚Äôs the spec they will be at 60 so practice how you fight and had zero problems leveling quickly. But What would I know right?
---
I‚Äôm not saying Ret isn‚Äôt better for grinding mobs it totally is. But this ONE TRUE WAY mentality you have here bud is flawed.
---
Naga in Azshara drop a fair bit of greens and clams with a chance at a golden pearl which is pretty valuable right now. There's some level 55-60 ones in the southeast of the zone up on the cliff. 
---
Ogres in deadwind pass drop good cloth and can be pickpocketed if you're a rogue. They die quick since half of them are casters and have not much health. 
---
Both places are relatively low on the activity scale since no quests bring you to either place.
---
Both spots the mobs drop at minimum 2 silver and i've seen up to 15 or 16 silver.
---

---
My guildies do it for me. It's for the benefit of the guild to get people in pre raid bis. I will pay it forward when I get to sixty as well. It's the whole point of having a guild.
---
Well except for undead then you better break out the sweaty palms
---
There is no reason to use slow heals if you have enough mana to spam flash. Sometimes the difference in casting speed means death.
---
Yeah that was my initial thinking, i ran MC once though last lock out in a pug and they were using a rotation of curses (i happened to have weakness). I used to run a rogue and didn't pay much attention to curses back then but I didn't recall us using them.
---
How is any dungeon taking you a few hours at level 60?
---
I just got into the game recently and I have a warlock, any spec recommendations?
---
Did you even look at the picture?  Look at the second item...
---
Un'Goro is going to be a bloodbath, moreso than it currently is.
---
Any place with valuable content or resources will have lots of pvp.  People go where the players are to get honor.  Also keep in mind that level 48s give honor to level 60s.  So the penultimate quest zones will be very camped.
---
Arnt all those level 60 dungeons tho??? Am I under the wrong impression. Can I run any of this at 53??  
---
 There was a post the other day saying it was op fault run was bad cause they took a 55 mage
---
58-60 the only quests I did were the Cauldron from the Bulwark (WPL).  Very easy quests and give ~12k per field, I believe theres 3 or 4 of chains.
---
Other than that, I started running LBRS and continued running BRD for Pre-BiS.  I've gained a fair bit of gold by going back to do all the missed quests I have in the 55-60 range.
---
Game doesn't work like that anymore. People don't work like that anymore.

Lololol very true. Definitely not a second life. I‚Äôll log on and maybe talk to some guildies and maybe get on discord like once a week. But these aren‚Äôt my homies. They‚Äôre just people that are also playing the same video game as me.
---
You suck and I hate you, nerd.
---
No I meant now. We rotate tanks out every week on 4 raid teams. If we can do it. This guild could of went with 9 and made it work.
---
cant pre pot mana potions
---
This gave me chills
---
It‚Äôs a lot like real life, people enjoy having power over others. Sometimes it‚Äôs in good fun, sometimes in someone who needs to feel powerful, and sometimes it‚Äôs just getting caught up in someone else‚Äôs quarrel. 
---
Some take it to far, for instance I had a guy camping me and another who where questing with 2 lvl 60s because he kept attack us and losing. I‚Äôm cool with it to land his revenge... even if he started it, but then he logged onto his second account on our faction to start harassing us. Even started messaging the other players guild. Stuff like this is not okay, but people do it. 
---
Remember your in a world where people are anonymous and can do stupid shit, not really worth wasting your time to figure it out. I would simply leave the area or go play an alt for a bit, pretty much best practice.
---
Good, glad to have people like you leave the game and come crying back when new content comes out.
---
I would never recommend hunter to a rookie. 1-9 are a temporary annoyance to veterans, but it‚Äôs a huge burden for a newbie.
---
Well I have followed it around on two different nights and it is running the same exact route, never deviating from it's course. I am killing mobs in it's path and it just runs on by until it meets something it can target, if I have tagged it first it charges, hits once every time then goes back to running its route. I have tagged those mobs and pulled aggro and once managed to get it stuck for 5 minutes until the the mob it killed re-spawned then it reset.
---
I have an open ticket with screenshots but no GM response, I am beginning to think it is a legit way of farming materials and loot to sell on the AH. Was this a thing in the original WoW or the Battle for Azeroth expansion?
---
Memeologist
---
Are they holding content back because people aren‚Äôt 60? Thought this was a scheduled release.
---
no, it's in reaction to entitled  or rude skinners  who are pushy.  I can understand that. I skin myself and have skinned tons of mobs other players killed.  The only difference is, I don;t ask for it, don;t tell them to loot, I just grab the opportunity when I see a trail of dead bodies.
---
Its because you click abilities dude.
---
Alright
---
Mages die very easily in unskilled hands.
---
What kind of person am I? 
---
Inquiring minds want to know.
---
Always use evasion against a warrior. I‚Äôd rather take an overpower every 5 seconds instead of an overpower, two autos and a MS in that same time.
---
Dude why would anyone want run a dungeon if they have nothing to gain from it. Most people have limited time to play per day, and don't want to waste their time cus some rando or guildie they barely know needs something.
---
Agility pot and mongoose... Retail hero?
---
Deviate Delight is fairly balanced, but favours alliance slightly.
---
Guild: Hey would you mind looting the core hound so the guild can skin it? 
---
You: what the fuck! Bro this is my loot I don‚Äôt have to loot it fuck you and this guild /gquit
---
Strath, winterspring and epl
---
Wow that's actually a pretty good idea
---
Damn casters and their tangle privileges. Make Azeroth great again!
---
Paladin works too atm. I've had one raid so far with more then 4 paladins and I've even seen a judgement crown go to the disenchanter so far.
---
Yes blizz has a item restoration from the website. How do you know it's a restoration from a scam?
---
Well in retail you can (through WoW tokens) essentially buy gold in game for real money. One of the major reasons Blizzard added this service was to cripple the third party gold selling services. 
---
So actually it makes total sense the hackers, who were most likely just after whatever raw currency they could get, would not touch a product that has no market.
---
Thats because we see you casting it so we use our fear immunity ability. 
---
Then we smash your face in. And stare at you waiting another 3 seconds before we smash it again. Repeated about 5 times before we kill you. Then wait to die from your DOTs before watching you soulstone.
---
But I want to stick to my dwarf priest more..
---
I mean, in retail you have a perfectly legitimate way to buy ingame gold from blizzard. It devalues RMT a fair bit, especially since the in game market is already deciding the value..
---
Won't matter when they stun lock you with gouge and blind until you die.
---
Warlocks are much more annoying for me as a rogue than warriors.
---
Sheep the bird
---
I'm not saying you're wrong but there has to be more to it than what you're saying. I get feared frequently as a tank and our fury warriors who are immune to fear dont magically gain threat. Nor do the dps above 35 yards. She attacks through fear.
---
My man you cant claim to be "keeping pace" with prebis rogues and then go "oh yeah all you need is wf and aoe packs". come on, who are you trying to kid?
---
id listen to an hour of that
---
Its not a problem exactly.
---
My guild can clear with our 30-35 core members, but having some extra people along makes things smoother.
---
 &gt; Bis shouldn't be on auto reserve
---
&gt; you can go ahead and need on other peoples BIS if you want but i am 100% keeping you out of any runs i can.
---
This is literally contradictory.  You are actively punishing players who don't treat BiS as reserved for specific classes.  So a mage who rolls on priest BiS will be treated exactly the same as someone who tries to take a reserved item.
---
I know what is good for me and what is good for others.  And I know how much of an upgrade pieces are for me.  If a +1 stat change is the difference, then I'm not going to lose sleep over it.  If it's a major upgrade or makes huge differences based on specific gear pieces or set bonuses, I'd expect that person to speak up prior to the roll.
---
*Challenge Accepted*
---
Sincerely,
---
That one rogue in your group....
---
It really isnt a 1% upgrade. Lionheart helm is a 1% upgrade from eye of rend? Dal rends is 1% over thrash/mirahs? No, dude. Alot of prebis is significantly better than the alternative.
---
I feel for those who were behind the first wave but I helped attune most of my guild including people who no longer log in to onyxia for like 3-4 solid weeks. After 50+ Jed runs and another 20ish full ubrs runs + 5 or so test of skulls I‚Äôm fuckin burned out on that shit. I‚Äôll still hop in and heal a guild group occasionally but you gotta catch me at the right time and ideally have at least a few people doing it for attunement.
---
Not to mention the 250 arena runs I did to help our main offtank get his SGC.
---
&gt;I actually only level 53
---
Ahh it all makes sense now. So you're new to this. Enjoy the feeling while it lasts. You haven't even experienced the game yet lol.
---
I must change my ways. Now that I know that my family is dishonored by my actions in the World of warcraft. I will now commit seppuku in order to cleanse the shame that I brought them through my actions of ganking low level players. Truly it is the lowest thing a human can do, worthy of pity. Good bye cruel World..of Warcraft..
---
Tiers of items is right. Because some Tier set pieces are actually just 'okay' or even straight 'bad'. So deciding ahead of time what drops fit in which round robin category is important. I'd probably go with 'God Tier', 'Good Tier', and 'Bad Tier' and see how it works for you. Maybe a separate tracker for things like Ony bags.
---
Years of experience playing a different version of the game isn't exactly applicable
---
Some of these things changed at some point during vanilla which can lead to people remembering something different than what classic presents.
---
Anything that changed late vanilla seems to trip people up from what I see.
---
This is a game changer!
---
You‚Äôd have a better chance at holding threat.
---
Considering I've barely played it in the last 8 months and 90% of my posts about that game have been critical, let's just agree that you're a creepy fellow who both stalks people's history and doesn't pay attention to it. xD
---
Please continue being butthurt because someone pointed out that MC is easier than many leveling dungeons.
---
You're really not helping OP. He wants to know if he's in the right or in the wrong. His issue comes from lack of knowledge.  He doesn't need to agree with "BiS first"-thinking but he needs to know what it means so he can have a opinion on the topic and identify if people are shitheads.
---
Your solution is to tell him not to think about it and spread false information and that will only make this kind of stuff happen to him again.
---
He doesn't need to agree with BiS-first. But he needs to know what it's about... And "BiS" certainly *doesn't* mean "really good item". It quite literally means "Best in Slot" which means best possible item and that is a huge difference. There are a few nuances and I clarified that in a different comment.
---
If you are Alliance then I have perfect guide for you - [Jame's Alliance leveling guide - Chapter II (41-50) [old version]](http://www.wow-pro.com/leveling_guides/jame039s_alliance_leveling_guide_chapter_ii_4150_old_version)
---
I've never lead as DPS but in ST I offer suggestions like "let's do trolls upstairs" now let's clear trash in the middle. South East to Jammal'an. 2 dragons in the middle. Anyone need Hakkar or do we skip? Last 2 dragons and then Eranikus. All that effort to lead the group away from ever trying to go downstairs for Atal'alrion. I had to do that boss once and I swear it adds 30 minutes for the worst fucking boss loot in the game.
---
The OP already has 30-35 core raiders. They don't really need to grow.
---
The extras make things smoother and help if people can't make it.
---
Our raid is full, helping them get bis will not help our raid. I sat in Mara for 6 hours, they can too
---
He might have reserved the name and might play it later. 
---
I always advice my friends who create the first time a character to create an entierly new name without special characters.
---
I spoke to another player, who said this bot was here this morning when he was online. so that means it has probably been there for the last two days farming materials and items to sell on the AH (at least, if not more, since that is the first time I tried to grind mobs on the Lake). 
---
Is this OK to do? Can we all start using bots since it doesn't seem to be punished?
---
Yeah this is my first char. I'm playing an enchanter I think. I heard you can make tons of gold selling buffs at some stone or somthing. I just cant wait to get rank 14 and do the bgs
---
Its worth abt 55s mate

Only some. Most of mine are key bound. There‚Äôs some that I am not comfortable yet with the key bindings as I am learning them still!
---
Glad im not in a "raiding guild". We're a chill casual guild I sent an IG letter to the raid leader with my enhancement trash spec about me being interested in raiding and im counted in. Outside of that we talk on gchat and help each other. If your build is about raiding don't except people to be social and not be here only to loot. If you want to have both a community guild and a good raiding team you should filter who enter and be clear about what it's going to be about and what kind of guild it is. If most people in your guild are spamming like idiots to enter the raid, most likely you didn't advertise your guild correctly otherwise it wouldn't be suprising to have people treat it as a loot sim. You would have had to look for serious guys ready to raid&amp;take part in the community if you wanted to have "teamplayers".
---
Didn‚Äôt think the bird was so damn speedy to catch up.
---
If that's the lake in the middle of the map south of the road there are a few black lotus spawn locations there and to the west.  If bots are what makes those seemingly impossible to find I hope gm's get involved.  I know they are 1 per zone and like 70 min respawn so they are hard to get anyways but at least need people actually checking and not all night bots.
---
Your yellow-damage hit cap is going to be 6% whether you're at +5 skill or +10 skill. Your hit chance beyond your yellow-damage hit cap isn't useless. It'll still increase your chance to hit with your white-damage. Though this is typically a breakpoint where hit becomes less valuable than other attributes e.g. after you have 6% hit, +1% crit is more valuable than +1% hit [until you reach a crit cap where all your hits are crits]. 
---
The extra +5 -&gt; +10 skill doesn't significantly affect your hit chance. There's still a pretty solid benefit going from +5 skill to +10 skill when you're fighting bosses (L63) because weapon skill will increase the amount of damage your glancing blows deal. The difference between +5 -&gt; +10 weapon skill is about a 4% increase in white-hit damage to L63 mobs because of the better glancing blow damage. 
---
FYI, rogues can get +5 weapon skill from the Weapon Expertise talent in the Combat tree.
---
You're waiting until BGs hit? Why not Phase 2 when the honor system hits?
---
Uhm.  I don‚Äôt think anyone had that kind of gold to waste on a BoE back in vanilla.  That must be inflation numbers from like Cataclysm/Pandaria days.
---
You want defense, first of all. Hit cap to avoid getting crit.
---
The +200 armor bonus shouldn't be your focus. Instead grab whatever mail and leather pieces which grant heavy amounts of +armor, stamina, dodge, etc.
---
Grab a fast one handed weapon.
---
Check out Druid BiS lists.
---
My guild kicked a shaman for insisting that he could tank. I kinda agreed with my guild because it's usually naive to try to make it work.
---
Well why don't THEY help ME out by getting their ass to 60 before asking to be carried?
---
Id argue 31/20 is the jack of all trades spec. You do okay damage in pve, youre god at pvp and you are good enough to tank. Unless you *really* desire to be "unique" and want to do that dual wield tank crap, no reason to try and look for something beyond that 31/20 spec as any other spec has you severely hurting somewhere else.
---
I believe its about improving an aspect of the guild, I could log on and just tank raids each reset but I help membere obtain items on their bis list. Another officer won truefaith recipe but just gave it to one of the healers in the guild because he needed it. 
---
Its about improving the guild as a whole and not just focusing on your own loot progression.
---
Oh man I had a guy whisper me while I was in a dungeon and offer to sell me a belt. It was only 7g, a big upgrade, and I asked him to COD me. I sat there thinking I should have checked AH, and later I did and see they were selling for 3.5g. I finally noticed his user name when the mail came. Jordanbelfort on Sulfurus Horde, bruh I‚Äôm not even mad, you gotta good play going.
---
Where tf were you before I dropped 30g!
---
Spy
---
Guess the company!
---
Multi billion dollar company can't provide you with same quality open world pvp as unpaid europeans in their basement.
---
That's right, Blizzard Entertainment.
---
No videos, but stats in bear are 6.5k hp, 57% mitigation.
---
With fort and Gift buffs.
---
Sounds a lot like my old guild.
---
Does anyone know of an addon that allows you to edit the default Blizzard buffs at the top right next to the minimap? I'd just like to resize them. I have zperl and I can disable them, but I want to keep them. Thank you in advance!
---
My friend who I live with also gets spammed by these quite often, but seems I don't fall into their customer category for some reason, cause I don't have the filter on and I've yet to recieve any invites.. Literally none! 
---
Lucky me I guess.
---
with improved blizzard, blizzard casts do an extra 77% of spellpower to targets over the duration, without imp blizzard its 110%
---
scaling dps - spellpower ratios is some retail simulator garbage, please leave that out of classic thx
---
still costs 30
---
Lots of tanks ninja'ing shit even \*with\* ridiculous conditions like "First two orbs on reserve" or "All orbs reserved".
---
Getting ready for raid night isnt exactly a huge undertaking. Most of them just afk in ironforge and are really helpful to guildies cause they have a vested interest in getting a core group of geared raiders
---
Wow again, I never said use only heal 2. Why would anyone say that? In fact if you read my post , its incredibly clear that I did not sudgest too only use heal 2.
---
Heal 2 is the most efficient. You should use it as your go to normal time heal. Obviously use your other abilities as needed ffs.
---
A guild on our server just fell through and we've had people waiting/staying online as alternates the last few raids, so we absorbed them and ran 2 32 mans last reset. More loot for everyone!
---
Dont RP beig a douchebag
---
And it's a fucking shame.
---
That‚Äôs the non-epic version of *Invincible*. *Pretty tough*.
---
That's total nonsense and you would never describe anything else in the game that way. I earned your savage gladiator chain drop on my warlock just as much as you on your warrior because we both fought the boss right? I can DE that for high value mats so why shouldn't I be able to roll for it equally? Because the highest priority above all else is if the gear is going to be equipped and used. I'm not saying arbitrarily what if a tank druid who has a warden staff already equipped sees one drop that he gets the priority because of his class and nothing else, but if he's got the Gnomer sledge hammer on then yeah for sure he does. A member of your group equipping the new gear is the definition of need and all else falls to greed.
---
Ok
---
Okay guy.
---
Yea I guess it‚Äôs personal taste really:) I was never a fan of too ‚Äúalien‚Äù landscapes and all that different dimensions and timelines
---
Yeah.... No. Get into a better guild my friend. Either one that has DKP or a transparent loot council system.
---
No matter what spec you decide to choose I would recommend starting with corruption cooldown from the affliction tree
---
You literally show zero proof.  
---
Not only that, you also ignore rule #3  
---
Bruh
---
I‚Äôve recovered my acct from a gold farmer years ago and judging from the items, they‚Äôre farming.
---
They're running their raids like the non-social players are pug applications. At least pugging you don't have to save your raid lockout for a group who may or may not take you.
---
We're still pretty early on in the classic lifecycle.  Most 60s still have a lot of pre bis to get and even more stuff to grind.  Don't get upset if people don't want to spend their time helping you when they still have stuff to do themselves. 
---
A good guild will generally help lower levels, but that doesn't make a guild bad if no 60s that are on are willing to help.
---
Because it's called empathy, and it's how you make friends?
---
Yep.  Had guildies who would rather not run UBRS at all than get a Jed tag to entice a healer to join their Rend run.
---
"Nah, bro, they should just want to help a guildie out."
---
fastest /played but not fastest real life time which is something OP is probably looking for. If you want to go crazy in the /played time you can accumulate rested xp, buy swiftness potions or if ou are rogues or druid sprint. use it, log out, log in again when its not on cd anymore and use it again. leveling at sprint speed all the way till 60
---
&gt;Yes but anyone could do that. That's the point!
---
Let's say you have two guys going for the same job. They both have the same paper qualifications, but one of them is newly hired and the other has 5 years with the company, a good attendance record and proven ability on top of being willing to help out his co-workers when shit needs to get done.
---
Which do you give the job?
---
This has nothing to do with Discord or anything else specifically. It means prove yourself to be dependable, willing to help others and be part of the wider community and people will act in kind. This really isn't that difficult to understand.
---
I agree. I would like that.
---
Yeah for 5 mans and the like for sure, in raids though I'm likely not going to be using CoA due to debuff slots, so that's why I was wondering if they'd be wanting me to use CoW and that would add something to the raid but it doesn't sound like it will be the case so I'll be going with CoA.
---
If you believe Blizzard is handing out permanent bans for a 100g scam you are either naive or delusional.
---
I don't necessarily agree with his overall argument, but i don't think he's saying it goes to waste outright, just that people avoid upgrades/spending on smaller pieces. Current guild uses dkp and i passed on 3 pieces last night because the other priest would have had more DKP for eye of divinity which, in turn, I won. Neither of us got 3 pieces that were upgrades for the most part because we both wanted the staff, though it still went to the other priests at a much lower cost. 
---
There's more than one DKP system of course but the problem he's describing is relatively common in any DKP guild i've been a part of
---
This is pretty much what I do.
---
if I was in your guild, I would quit lol.
---
Out of everything I said; what you took away was; ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre too stupid to tank‚Äù 
---
Up until this comment no, thats not at all what I was saying, but it sure as shit is what Im saying now! üòÇ
---
&gt; I clearly gave you a scenario where it would be faster to take a screenshot with their phone.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
&gt; No one was arguing against that it is the fastest method if you are setup for it
---
Make up your mind dumb dumb. Are you or are you not arguing for speed? Also you gave me a situation in which the person was tech illiterate. By definition the only way for it to be faster for someone who is already using their computer is if they don't know enough about computers because phones are just more unwieldy computers.
---
&gt; Many people do not use their desktop to even comment on Reddit let alone post to it.
---
Yes many people like the tech illiterate. 
---
&gt; Many people don‚Äôt give a fuck about taking screenshots of the game either.
---
Good for them but this entire thread is about taking a screenshot on the computer of a game.
---
&gt; I hate to be that guy, but I am more technically literate than you unless you have worked as a full stack engineer and have been more distinguished in the field than me.
---
My title is senior software engineer and I've been programming since I was 10. If your accolades are anything like your ability to argue or reason then I've had you beat from birth.
---
your guild blows dick.
---
Winterspring yeti cave
---
And thats why you use dkp or other similar systems to try to objectively track attendance. They accomplish the same thing.
---
Except on lucifron when you only have 4 priests dispelling REEEE
---
Well there are more things to consider than weapon speed....like stats. QS is the best tank weapon because it gives you stats. I get what you are saying but only looking at a weapons speed is a weird way of gearing for a tank.
---
It's literally being used by a bad player to mean "really good item" in his example mate. This entire exchange is exactly what he should avoid. 
---
OP just needs to try to play Wow while he can before he ends up talking loot roll politics in an Ironforge bar over upgrades. 
---
And to clarify when people say "BiS" it's not Best possible item in slot. It's followed by conditionals such as P1, or pre-raid etc. So yeah, it's just 1 of several "really good items" but very likely one of the best and again nothing to worry about when deciding whether or not you roll.
---
If you need, you need.
---
Blizzard does not have a 1.1 spell coefficient, with or without the talent, over its 8 second duration.
---
You are literally comparing scaling abilities, and dont want to compare it apples to apples.
---
Blizzard is a 8 second channeling spell.  
---
AE is a 1.5 second GCD spell.
---
Do you think +100 blizzard damage is better than +40 AE damage just because the number is bigger?
---
Helping someone doesn't necessarily mean that you run something continuously all day until a specific piece drops.
---
Do you know how many will be found in the next 2 years?
---
It never worked like that.  The key is to incorporate as many people into the runs you're already doing for your own purposes.
---
Yeah I did.  Rereading it now, I actually don't believe you though lol
---
I think it's 2 minutes, but i believe you do have to run out of the portal and manually reset?
---
I literally tried this today. Logged out for 2 mins plus an extra minute to be safe. I was then at the entrance portal to BRD but im 95 % sure the instance didnt reset because the locked door on the left was opened.
---
You say you didn‚Äôt then you do it again. 
---
If you want to be a bad, fine, but don‚Äôt try to trip others into bad habits.
---
I won't block channel invites for gold doners though
---
Damn I was gonna do 2 alts together again
---
Yes, the tank should be aware that he has a fucktard selfish RageQueen wearing Gnomish Goggles because of the 'awesome agi to my crit, man' and should slow the group for me to recover the extra 15% mana I'm spending every pull keeping that guy up.
---
UC is the one true city
---
I use TinyThreat but it never seems to work, so right under my Details! pane I have Classic Threat Meter which does seem to work.
---
I miss Skada, so much better than any WoW Classic addon :(
---
Yeah I still haven't found a use for tiger's fury.
---
Well people should learn to help themselves when it comes to stuff like this. Its really as simple as typing classic wow druid macros on google. Asking help for more advanced stuff is one thing but the basics are really as simple as this.
---
Ive explained this multiple times but flying didnt kill world pvp as I experienced *plenty* of it back when TBC was new. In fact Outland *encouraged* pvp as there were multiple zones with objectives to hold and you got things in exchange for doing so. Then you had the other thing of epic flying costing 5000g, so most of the people would rather use their epic ground mount than the really shitty 60% flying mount.  
---
Epic flying is a luxury very few people got to experience, especially for majority of the expansion. World pvp in Outland was *encouraged*. All it did was make travel easier.
---
I think you mean hi Ret paladin guildmasters
---
Sounds like more gold than brains
---
It's gone from 1 every 4 hours to 1 every half hour for me.  Just when I was about to lose my mind a guildie informed me of this check box, saved my sanity
---
Eh, wotf isnt long enough to kill me through two 2k shields and a hearthstone
---
Ideally, the GM should be the main tank. He should get tank loot funneled to him.
---
For officers, that can be an issue. Fortunately, my guild doesn't seem to play favorites between officers and core raiders.
---
You are in Classic WoW sub. You must blindly worship Classic if you don't want to get downvoted. If you say something even remotely negative about classic... it's pitchforks time!
---
I understand man but it's a habbit you gotta kick in one go.
---
Icy Veins is terrible and I recommend you stop using it asap. Seriously.. people who make those guides typically have no idea wtf theyre talking about and only have a general knowledge.
---
The way druids work is the same as rouges. You either open and win or get opened on and run away healing. Or you face a warlock and then you just die.
---
It's not about physically following them around like a pet. It's that a significant (more than a raiding guild's) worth of people play with part of their desire being to do whatever the fuck Asmo (and others to a lesser extent) wants to do.  
---
This has an effect on the game.
---
Yeah I've been in quite a few Arena-Angerforge(+sometimes Golem) runs with lowest level being 54 in those groups. The lower levels get some decent exp and the 60s get people who are necessarily there for the exact same gear pieces.
---
I'm a 50 hunter atm with skinning and leather working, and have yet to select a leather working specialisation. Is leather working - even tribal leather working - a decent profession if you aren't in a group to farm devilsaur leather? I'm thinking from the perspective of making gold for the epic mount at 60.
---
Roger I haven‚Äôt done that yet. I‚Äôll take another look at it
---
How is a shaman tank any less viable for 5 mans than a dual wield fury warrior?
---
But is there a forge closer? Sometimes I want to smelt a few bars without having to run to valley of honor or fly to TB
---
Which part? That I make 5 per 4 days, or that it won't sell? It finally sold after 3 1/2 days. I start it again today and going to see how long it takes.
---
Any more tips on playing against a warrior as a rogue?
---
No, I don‚Äôt think I will.
---
Yeah it's really nice so you can fear a mob or player without retargetting.
---
HotW/NS spec. You can tank dungeons at 60 and heal raid content.
---
I have no complaints. Typically within the top 5 on the healing charts (MC/Ony).
---
Heal 2 is priests most efficient heal spell. How am I bad?
---
Why is it such a big deal if the item isn't worth shit?
---
Didnt mean it as a problem. I shouldve worded it differently. I personally like some fluctuation so you can farm out in the world early in the morning which wasnt really possible on pservers.
---
I know battleground pvp is viable it‚Äôs just open world pvp and farming in so useless like I see a 55 mage and I want to gank him and if I was most other classes I could very easily but as holy it‚Äôs tough.
---
Most raid spec warriors dont have sweeping strikes, im not aware of cleave strategies for fury warriors. Just using cleave isnt that amazing
---
&gt; I also have this issue where some mobs stay nova'd 2 seconds longer than everyone else and my pull gets fucked up, but that might be because I'm not grouping them up tightly enough for the FS+CoC+Exp. to hit them all?
---
you wait until the nova only has 3-4 seconds left to start casting your flamestrike into CoC, that way if the FS breaks some of the mobs but not all, the unbroken ones will come out of it anyway in half a second
---
Blizzard is not holding back content any more in Classic than they are in Retail. The phases are scheduled to work in a similar manner as the patches did back in the day. Dire maul was a nice addition before phase 2 is out imo.
---
Also atleast in Classic you still have to put the group together and they have to know some mechanics in MC to fully clear it with a pug. Unlike in raid finder where you can literally do whatever (or not do anything) and clear it.
---
That doesn't go with "kill them."
---
Get out of here, cloth paladin.
---
Dunno where you're getting that, it's pretty easy to turn around since they need to run well past you, there's a bit of a leeway if they're too close.
---
Alliance can pretty much stop the horde advance at the bridge no matter how good the horde is. Therefore bartles can take hours, days, the longest was like was 16 days.
---
Nice video, thanks a lot for sharing!
---
Dreamweave Helm / Gloves / Chest. After that, Owl / Eagle greens.
---
Thx for the info man! Appreciate the advice from someone who‚Äôs played locks before. So far it‚Äôs been a lot of fun!
---
&gt; or doing 4 different difficulties of the same raid
---
There it is. The confirmation you have absolutely no idea how retail works yet you spread false rumors about it.
---
How does what someone else chooses to do while in game affect you, or anyone else, at all?
---
Do you go around asking every single person what they're doing in game and get mad when they aren't doing what you think they should be doing?  No.  So what effect does other people wanting to play in Asmon's guild have on you?
---
So much this! I loved the balance of tbc but the whole setting felt way too much like sci fi space expliration. Mage t6 looked like a crossing between a radio tower and a star wars character... Not my cup of tea at all.
---
Well I am one of those people who take half a year to hit 60 and I‚Äôd venture to say there are far more of us so that would be their reasoning. Cater to the larger audience. But that‚Äôs just my opinion. It sounds like you should go level an alt or something to keep you busy.
---
Back in a day for me it was rank 4 heal / rank 1 G heal for normal healing (renew on tanks if got mana spare), flash heal only for emergency (but max rank), PoH for aoe heal. Max rank G heal pre casted for expected spike dmg. But i didn't had all calculations you have so i can be wrong. Btw, never been oom except for huhuran (didn't progress further, RL, school etc).
---
Exactly. Most of you bads don‚Äôt realize you are- prob why it‚Äôs so pathetic.
---
That must be an American thing then because on EU servers BiS literally means Best in Slot. Of course you can say BiS Phase 1 etc.
---
In my view there's a very big difference between saying "really good" and "the best available right now".
---
I believe for prot warriors it is 440. Mind you, it is extremely hard for them to reach 440 even with obtaining prebis gear. 
---
I dont even think you'll be able to reach anything higher than 400 without plate...or in other words, ur just going to get 1 hit killed by crits relentlessly. 
---
Btw droods dont have to have defense, its innate in their bear form or something.
---
IT's warped towards flash heal because topping people off is what keeps players alive. It's effective healing in the time frame somebody might take a tick of damage that kills them.
---
Using slow heals only makes sense if you are good at reading incoming damage and are 100% sure they won't take a killing blow before you get the heal off.
---
If you can't afford to be using quick heals to top people off then people in your raid aren't doing a good job of avoiding damage.
---
Weaving between fast and slow heals as the situation requires, alongside proper consumable usage is the correct way to play a priest in classic.
---
The ways they deal with point hoarding diminish that "feeling of contribution" that was initially posted about. DKP also does very little in highly contested loot items straight up going to waste on classes that don't effectively use them.
---
Never implied that it was. They could've made it work differently, that's all.
---
But then you don‚Äôt get a special item
---
The lay out favors alliance, better graveyard locations, easier to defend areas, better archer locations.
---
It's not impossible for horde though, just favors allaince.
---
It's roughly a 10% drop rate between 12:00-18:00 server time in Azshara, Feralas, STV (jaguero isle only), Tanaris, and The Hinterlands and these require 205 fishing skill and 300 for a 100% chance to not miss your catch.
---
Then also in Azshara, there are 3 areas call Bay of Storms, hetaera's clutch, and Scalebeard's cave that require 330 minimum to cast, and 425 to not miss your cast. I get myself to 420 and catch 9/10 casts, probably 9.5/10 - I don't miss often. This area has a 20% catch rate roughly.
---
You can't catch them between midnight and 6am. Best rates are 12-6pm.
---
Are you seriously asking how a warrior is a better tank than a shaman in 5 mans?
---
Bindings reserved for hunters
---
Ok. You havnt explained what you mean? Are you saying it's not most efficient?
---
That fucking wand resist LOL
---
Never discredit looking at zones that are green to you. Doing green quests will be a lot faster since you slightly out-level them. Use the Questie Addon to see hotspot zones.
---
Also, at 45 you can do a bunch of ZFs for that free mageweave and XP
---
Don't pug. IT doesn't offer loot security. You'll always be rolling against new comers.
---
Also you might be a class/role that has a lot of loot competition in which case, that's just kind of how classic is.
---
Don't join a guild that uses loot council, they're trying to emulate a model of gaming that doesn't make sense for the content difficulty were playing.
---
Try to find one that uses round robin, or some type of dkp system.
---
Actually its a 2 part business. They have a chinese version of the website that buys gold from individual gold farmers while they advertise to players and sell it to them at a higher price.
---
I have no doubt some use bots but not all
---
could u tell the how much in comparison in percent?
---
People are constantly whining about tank privilege, but that goes away immediately the moment dungeon tanks are plentiful.
---
Thank you sir! I will collect because I love how they look!
---
It‚Äôs not a completely closed system anymore. You can buy gold. By trading game time ( copied from eve online). It‚Äôs a good mechanic and helps but these people out of business
---
We're still trying! Unfortunately he's rezzing in the middle of 5 guards.
---
Edit: We are in Orgrimmar! I just sapped him.
---
Usually i just skip these, since they are always boring. But this was ok. Those double vanish but still died clips were funny. How afk can you do this? On my mage when i aoe farm zf i feel like i cant watch stuff, since i always have to pay attention. Wondering if this is a more relaxed option
---
Why don't you split the raid and form two? In my opinion it's very hard to get too much raid willing players. Of course there is a spot where you have not enough for two raids but too much for one but you sound like you're far past that. Keep in mind that 20 man dungeons are around the corner. At some point all have to split. 
---
At the moment we have one guaranteed raid per week but frequently do aa second one. This of course requires a advance registration and people willing to tank/heal or DPS depending on the situation. 
---
There was some argument at first about people that didn't want to split but it actually helped with loot distribution and the common 40 player in MC problem of boredom.
---
I understand why you do this, but you risk alienating people with demanding IRL commitments, and/or a tight-knit friend group with schedules that don‚Äôt line up well-enough to raid together.
---
But people should try to make friends,  or at the very least communicate with guild leadership their situation of being busy or shy or whatever.
---
That 80% number is as "pulled from the ass" as was his original "it's 3-4x more popular than retail".
---
And that's where you go from just a person commenting to someone who seems to have a vested interest in the result.
---
I lol‚Äôd
---
Nobody is making you join a group with a reserved item.
---
&gt;Short fights I'll heal where needed but I won't kick myself racing to oom 
---
What part about "Healing where needed" suggests I let people die because I'm using the wrong heal? Healing isn't a brainless 1 button job, you need to use judgement. I have 6 different healing spells bound for a reason.
---
People who are abusing flash heals on *short* fights are not helping anyone. They are wasting mana to make sure their heals and not the heals of the other 5 bored healers pointed at the tank land.
---
And why don't you take another DPS? Because those harder fights I'm mentioning, where people are squeezing every last HP out of their mana bar, are the ones where healers matter the most.
---
What about the 0.5 tier set I keep hearing of?
---
This. People saw the wow tokens as a cash grab (it was) but it also drastically lowered account hacking from what i recall reading. There was a period just before the authenticatiors got released where it seemed everyone i knew was hacked at least once. It caused me to reroll when they got me because blizz refused to give all the items back on all my characters.
---
You can go 4/5 with a 1.3 pet, 3/5 works pretty well for BT. Putting 5 points into it is a waste.
---
Yea that was a nice description indeed sir!
---
Hol up where's the second shield coming from 
---
I assume the first is voidwalker sacrifice
---
Gear doesn't matter pre-55. Blackrock Depths is when you start seeing + Spell Damge and + Healing in any capacity. In Zul Farrak and Scarlet Monastary, Healing Gear = Caster DPS gear. It's the way things go.
---
Time to collect!
---
We don't have this problem. We have had 1 raider leaver since release and that was because of work commitments. Try be more engaging. Dkp and benching works well to keep people from feeling left out too.
---
Ahhh... I've been expecting you.
---
Use rupture and expose armor to ignore their pesky plate gear
---
ty :)
---
Or just use the chrome remote and open battlenet and wow on it and chat that way or you could go through the steam platform and do it that way as well however if you want to see your chat bar you might want to use the chrome extension so you can zoom it and start looking that way
---
Surprised he's not wearing it upside down like most helmets.
---
Yes, I did that yesterday.
---
But i had a buddy of mine take my old name, dont think it acts the same way if you take it yourself
---
Question: is cat form the best for PVP even if you're not specced or geared for it? As a resto druid I have no idea what the best way for me to do damage is. Usually Ill just switch between casting and cat form
---
It was spammed on the forums. Were you living under a rock ?
---
What are you on about? Everyone gets a 20% chance, on the item. You miss the concept?
---
Why is what you described a problem? Some of you chose to go for a big upgrade and other guys went for more smaller upgraded. Sounds alright to me.
---
But I still get notifications in the chat windows that the person invited me even if the popup is blocked.  
---
Apparently Blizzard's definition of blocked is different than mine.
---
If he's wearing Gnomish Goggles then you're talking about low level content. There's almost no helmets to use at those low levels, and Gnomish Goggles' 9 Stam is going to be much better than the tiny amount of armor you're going to get from wearing a mail item. I mean really, your argument here is DPS Warriors in 5 mans should wear plate gear for the very few times when they take AoE physical damage?
---
Use it, wait for energy to regen to 100, then ravage. You'll have a very small window in which you're back at 100 energy with tiger's fury active.
---
Thanks! My first attempt at any video editing so that took longer than the run tbh lol...well I was watching movies the whole time on my second monitor so not didn't require any real mental effort besides boss battles. RNG is a b\*\*\*\* aha gl :)
---
No clarification? Cool.. thanks for adding to the substance of the conversation.
---
I‚Äôm still here, I‚Äôm the lock lol this bot is persistent
---
You got NO CHANCE? How about farming gold? Very good chance!
---
Sure is, go right ahead and start botting.
---
Epic. Much respect
---
This is the first Tauren I've ever made and so far I've only worn engineering goggles and this mask. Looking forward to my first upside down helmet tho üòÅ
---
DKP can be gamed. For example, your 3 Warlocks collectively agree not to bid high on Tier sets, so they can save all their DKP for loot they roll against the mages for.
---
Second, players will horde DKP for specific items and loot ends up split inefficiently. For example, dagger rogues top priority is Perdition's Blade. I would absolutely skip every other item until I have enough DKP to outbid everyone else on Perdition's Blade.  As a result, you will end up with a guy who gets Perdition's Blade while the rest of his gear is blues and greens, while another guy is rocking full tier sets but never has the DKP for a weapons upgrade.
---
Third, it just adds a lot of time and upkeep to loot distribution. Its a lot more work for both officers and raiders.

---
Sounds like arugal
---
You‚Äôre implying it would be prohibitively difficult to design the new content, but they have so much to work with and experience creating zones and instances that I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the issue.
---
The issue would be executive meddling resulting in a compromised project, it remains to be seen if the community can continue to defy the changes that those people want to add a priori
---
They were hitting the MT and Also the OT. They were stacked.
---
Because you helping them at low levels serves twice as much value as them helping you at 60. You're not only helping them get BiS, but you're helping them level to 60 so in turn they win twice, and by them winning you have more relevant players in your guild.
---
The other bonus is that people who help each other are more likely the enjoy each other's company and want to keep playing together, which leads to less guild turnover which is better for everyone. But I don't think you've learned that lesson in life yet.
---
Sounds like you have a bunch of scum fucks in your guild if they‚Äôre trying to push off beneficial buffs that benefit the whole raids progression just so they can **attempt** to beat you on the meters
---
Shhhhhh, you are not supposed to tell. If Blizz finds out we are getting things for free they'll implement paid services asap.
---
I only ran ST once as well, we had this drop in a group of druid, pally, mage, rogue, hunter.... Pretty sure it was vendored
---
1. I have a convenient key bind for cancelling all forms to switch to human. This way whenever you need to cast anything you just have to hit this first. Alternatively, you can create macros for individual spells, it just eats up more keybind real estate and can be annoying if your still leveling.
---
2. Powershifting macros make your life better and easier. They let you switch from bear to cat without having to switch to human in between. Also from bear to bear or from cat to cat to remove root/slow effects as well as get you your furor bonus.
---
So what about the whole time I was playing shaman in vanilla? When I did the whole rank 11 grind and Mc bwl back during classic? None of that experience is relevant today because? If the point is to tank 5 mans all of his content is out already, Gratz you‚Äôve beaten the game Dire Maul has been cleared! Classic is gonna be a real treat for you.
---
It isn't uncommon for guilds to have a rank for backup/bench raiders. It isn't hard to list the invite rules along with the signup saying "Core raiders get invite priority. If we still have spots after inviting the core raiders then we will start inviting from the bench. Invites are not first come first served as we have to keep comp in mind". 
---
Some people won't like those rules and some people won't read them. Either of those groups wouldn't really be a good fit so it's just another way to weed out people who don't really have the same priorities as the guild. There are casual guilds, and pugs, that operate on more of a FCFS basis and someone who isn't okay with the example rules above would probably enjoy that environment more.
---
Why the rude ‚Äústop it‚Äù when that‚Äôs what they said.
---
Hi ret paladins.
---
You missed the part where they mention that the players are largely non-interactive.  
---
\&gt;  They seem to have no interest in the guild as a community. They never help anyone out or run dungeons with other people in the guild, they never log into discord except during the raid, and they don't spend any time talking with anyone or making friends. 
---
So yes, as a previous guild and class officer, those determinations do have a fairly significant weight when it comes to determining who "deserves" to go.  
---
If you recruit a 60 DPS warrior who refuses to tank, and that keeps some players from finishing, say, their Onyxia attunement; how is that going to pan out in the long run regarding guild health?  
---
Guilds that raid tend to need to rotate characters into roles.  The DPS warrior of today may be expected to OT.  If someone isn't willing to step out of their comfort zone to do what is needed; can you reasonably expect them to run away from the party when Geddon bombs them, or to fuck up their rotation to have tranquilizing shot available, or any other number of the things besides just stabbing shit that makes a raid and a raiding guild viable?
---
This guy is doing the right thing.  He's pulling in good people; letting some of the slackers figure out their own path, and isn't causing a shitload of drama.
---
Can someone actually explain what i‚Äôm looking at without a bunch of jokes and lies?
---
a lot of y'all don't pvp and it shows
---
Just use Steamlink.
---
You don't farm this for gold. The two drakes are the only boss you can reach without clearing trash, and most of the time they drop nothing.
---
Scarcity leads to turf war which puts the "war" in "warcraft".
---
I mean look at his troll username.
---
BIS until BWL, you meant?
---
I was there.. the goosebumps! &lt;3
---
Death Grips are BiS as a tank IMO. /s
---
But seriously love those fucking gloves.
---
What makes you think he doesn't? It's possible to enjoy both balanced 1v1s and unfair ganks.
---
You came across poorly in your OP but I agree on this.
---
I don't understand still why so many people who aren't 60 yet are bothered if things get released before they are ready. 
---
Maybe it's just culture has changed or maybe it's a retail mindset but back in vanilla not everyone was going to see all the content but the major things like MC/Ony were relevant and being run all the way through. Right up until BC there were guilds who only ran MC/Ony and even more guilds who were in BWL but farmed the earlier raids weekly.  In my view if you are casual to the point of still being in the 30s 2 months after release then that's the kind of tier you are likely to be capping at when you are at 60 so why does it matter if you aren't there yet?
---
I tried to say this in some threads and people flamed me making fun like I think i'm an amazing player or better then them but the reality is that's the tier I'm going to hit too because at this point in my life I'm not investing the time and energy either.
---
But to address your OP I think releasing BWL now would be a mistake, yes the people who have pushed ahead or want more of a challenge will be bored but if they just rush the raid tiers then the lifespan of the game won't be long enough. DM was not a big deal but yeah BWL i'd hold off on. It's a shame MC is so easy, probably a combo of 1.12 having all the class rebalancing, improved loot tables, us knowing what we are doing more, people following BiS guides instead of just wearing whatever the fuck they want but yeah it is what it is and if you can't find the fun right now I'd suggest a break.
---
*There's no cars in world of warcraft!*
---
An hour? Just one?
---
As a damage dealer his thing is dealing damage unless he's tanking. And you should be aware for when you get to end game. Some tanks will be tanking DW Fury for threat. And they'll even wear items with no mitigation at all. This isn't 2006 anymore.
---
Well, thing is, he is bleeding from the rake ability. It ticks. But Rip won't apply, explain that.
---
You mean the bluepost that was posted AFTER I posted here? Ahh yeah that one, nice.
---
It's still a bug, there are dozens of screenshots and videos showing this happening when the mobs don't use thrash, and there's no way mobs that do have thrash are supposed to be able to build up charges of thrash to unload on the next unsuspecting player who aggros them.
---
I can think something is unethical and still do it.
---
Using a DKP system is a great way to make the looting system fair in my opinion.
---
Also, i can confirm on the ‚Äúinvite‚Äù spam. I became classleader yesterday, and we did a raid today, and I kept getting pms for invites ü§£
---
I know that every low level rogue is going to deserve it at some point in the future. Pre-revenge so to speak
---
Big true, we should fully expect blizzard to wait until every single player and all their alts are 60 before they do anything
---
Taunt
---
You wait until the tank has some more threat. Just single target for a bit. If the tank pulls too much, they should be coordinating with you so you can frost nova when they about to dip out.
---
Your goal is to let the tank get hit and cast some aoe threat. Enough so that even if you pull aggro, the tank is still way ahead of the healer's threat. It's a little trickier if the tank is pulling massive packs and expects you to nova at the right time to save them. If it's a problem just pull smaller packs. 
---
Once the mobs are halfway dead, you can unload with aoe and it won't matter if you pull because they'll be so weak.
---
I mean your guild could limit it's members or if you didn't want to do that you could just start recruiting for a 2nd raid team.
---
Then leave it to your imagination boyo.
---
oh. that's odd. I've never seen that
---
    Second, loot council makes no sense when the content is this easy. It only exists to serve the in group guilds members at the expense of everyone else.    
---
If you've never experienced a properly implemented LC, its easy to think the system sucks. It makes alot of sense to run a loot council, provided its ran well and not a shit fiesta like the one in OP's post.
---
Content might be easy as shit right now but (hopefully) it won't be the case for latter tiers. In order for a guild to survive to those latter tiers, you need longevity and LC is by far the easiest way to get longevity for your guild, as it allows you to distribute loot by taking into account latter patches, by knowing what items remain BIS for which classes and for how long. With a good system, there's very little drama because its easy to understand that person A gets X item because its BIS for 5 patches where as for person B's class, X item would be good until next patch.
---
For example, our Shamans get prio on Salamander legs from MC as druids (and priests but they cant equip salas anyway) get comparable T2 legs. Since shamans get prio on salas, they won't get prio on Empowered legs in BWL as they're very comparable to salas for shamans, where as for druid/priest Empowered legs are huge upgrades from t2 and are absolute bis for the rest of the game. Shamans will of course get Empowered legs as soon as druids/priests have them, just like druids can get salas as soon as shamans have them.
---
Having well thought out prios that account for the future creates a good vibes situation with no drama at all, as long as the loot council has experience to do such calls (tbf just join class discords and look at bis lists, not that hard) and they communicate semi transparently with raiders about their plans for the future and about how they distribute loot in general (Attendance/performance/preparation etc.) Without a loot council, you don't get to do these kinds of long term plans as efficiently and your guild's progress raids become harder and harder by each tier because you haven't distributed gear optimally.
---
Furthermore, its also worth mentioning the way people look at guilds and loot systems. We've found that if you do roll or dkp, you tend to get people who are interested in their short term gains (example: banking dkp for absolute bis, not accepting loot because it'd take away dkp) and they're less likely to wanna stick around or "be a team player" (which is bullshit in itself but a topic for another time). With a great loot council, you get people who are in for the ride and will be around for a long ass time, which itself creates longevity as well.
---
Randos? They are in the same guild
---
Is this true? I hate my name but dont want to risk my lvl 50 warrior
---
It does, I use it occasionally farming Mara when I step away from the PC a while. I'm just not sure if the timer is 30 minutes or an hour or what.
---
i mean, you said you were beating every sword rogue you ever encountered as a argument that dagger was better. apologies if i miss read

Bad at pvp?? Those were some pro ass plays
---
I don't raid full "raid" spec. As a priest Healer I have + Smite DPS and some other things. With forty people, you don't need √ºber DPS spec to succeed. You also don't need to be #1 on the charts. Take ice block, take things that improve your survivability. Take things that will help a bit outside of a raid. Dead DPS is 0 DPS, so less DPS and alive &gt; Higher DPS and dead.
---
and if  alterac valley was alliance favored were one of the other two horde favored?
---
Shaman tanking for any 5-man content is completely viable. Raid tanking as the OP is wanting to do is a bit out of reach since Shamans have no way to push crushing or crit blows off the table, and they can't get a high enough armor value or health pool to take the full hits when they do occur.
---
"Running like a pug" was the insult. There are far more efficient ways to organize a raid if you have an actual guild to work with.
---
And this is how you role play a scammer.
---
Years ago when I played a moonkin in wrath of the lich king I suffered this occasionally due to latency issues. Sadly, running back and forward through casters was often done and would occasionally catch people out. While playing on my warrior I would do it to people and it worked often enough to be worth trying. It even worked on people who were otherwise outplaying me.
---
I'm not trying to say my skill level is high, I know it isn't, but I am saying that my experience was that this does work often enough to be worth doing. However, it may work a lot less these days due to better ping (back when this was widely done we were on oceanic servers with 350ish ping).

---
As a gnome Master race i love this list. We don't need help in pvp. The world needs help from us.
---
But why
---
Honestly, I prefer the lower-pressure of 40 man raids.
---
As a DPS, I don't have to worry that i am putting my raid in a bind by showing up a bit late or skipping weeks. With 10 mans, thats harder.
---
Its also why I enjoy that raids aren't particularly difficult.
---
Fairbanks - I get multiple an hour.  I report all of them.
---
Holding aggro on multiple targets is a pain, not to mention going OOM every fight to spam ES. On longer boss fights your going to OOM and rockbiter auto attacks are not going to be enough  threat vs a mage or lock.
---
"Hop on comms and attempt to make friends?" How about we play a game without all talking on the phone with each other the whole time?
---
I once RPed a Human Paladin by the name of Tim Allen. He was down on his luck. His public broadcast, Tool Talk, had just went under. He sat in Goldshire Inn, just trying to drown his woes. Reminiscing on old memories of his show, he noticed a Pandaren and Gnome sitting by a window. The Gnome was commenting on how hard they just came. Tim ended his life that day. Never played Alliance again.
---
There is no life so how do you kill that which has no life? Is a neat set probably worth a ton of money at somepoint cos of the rarity gz on the investment

Hi, /u/apatheticgamer

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dpe2do/multiboxers_of_wow_who_hurt_you/). 
---
Phase 3, so not too long given phase 2 will probably be here soon.
---
I'm personally gonna tell my mom on them.
---
The issue with bestowing gear for the sake of greatest upgrade can discourage some from attempting to progress outside of raids.
---
Blizz totally fucked faction balance on my server (skeram) so I don't expect much PvP in phase 2.
---
Gnomish Death Ray and the Battle Chicken are the biggest two i believe
---
do you know of any baseline lore explanations for oblivious people like me? i'm not that into the lore but feel like it can add a whole new dimension to my enjoyment that i don't currently have. I love reading quest logs and contextualizing quests..makes my character feel like he's on a hero's journey with an actual arch. Would likely only add to that if I got the basics of WoW lore downpat.
---
Bring friends I guess
---
If you are in a situation where you can use it while running to the target and still cap energy before you get there, TF is worth it.
---
A character who is intentionally kept at a low level and then geared to the max so they can pwn people in battlegrounds.  With a level 19 'twink' being the most popular.
---
Fucking bird. And hyena.
---
Alliance has Paladins for this. Can't shamans do this or is their dispell just on enemies?
---
&gt;  IMO it should just be the big expensive ones
---
Really, when it all boils down to it then, it's about greed!
---
Yes! Welcome! WoW (even this old game!) has so much to offer. I was completely enamored back in the day, and I still am. I can't believe how good of a game it is. I straight up am NOT a gamer. I don't play games. I don't identify as a gamer. I don't care about other games.
---
To me, WoW is a fun, exciting, easy, simple, challenging, time-consuming computer-oriented community where you can play whatever role you want with others and there's months and months and months of fun for every role/class. You can definitely immerse yourself in the World of Warcraft.
---
I'm glad you're excited. Enjoy leveling your professions, making friends, forming repeat groups with good players, killing, being killed, exploring zones, wandering into death traps, sneaking where you shouldn't, taking on new challenges. It's just as fun with alts - there's always something new to try. I started playing in 2007 I think, and there's still soooooo much I haven't done still (* I'm not a hardcore player). Haha. Let that be some perspective for you.
---
For druid DPS and tanking, when should I prioritize strength vs agility? I know for cat dps agility is better up to a certain point, but when exactly? And it's the same way for bear tanking right? 
---
I'm level 41 so as I level to 60 I'm curious which item stats I should prioritize. 
---
Also, how does raw attack power compare to agi/str? For example I just got a 2H that has +34 attack power. And I have a 1H + off that have +7 str, +6 int, +2 stam, +3 spirit all together. The 34 AP gives a higher dps stat when in cat form, but at which point should I choose the raw stats for crit, armor, dodge, etc?
---
Just looking for general stat advice on gear for druid. Thanks!
---
what do u mean? all the ppl in the clips are in real guilds lol not streamer guilds if thats what you think
---
Have cleared BRD full (even Emperor) with lv60 Shaman tank, though I don‚Äôt know how he was able to hold aggro without a taunt button
---
I put in twice as much time *at minimum* than our lowest performing raiders. I have still passed loot to other players because I want to avoid that picture. 
---
That said i'm not going to give someone who has barely put a quarter of the effort I have the best gear in the game. It also doesn't exclude the best players from that same gear either. My top performing *non management* players are much better geared than any officer.
---
Why? Because I know i'm not going anywhere and also know that i'm not going to be judged for my DPS by anyone--my parses are already fine enough.
---
Its 9 tanks vying for the raid spots, not 9 raid spots for tanks
---
odds were massively against you, but you won. Great job
---
Surprisingly managed to pick this off craigslist, the plastic pieces still in the plastic for $30! I‚Äôd recommend using online platforms to see if it‚Äôs obtainable! Doesn‚Äôt seem to be too bad as far as I can tell!
---
Wasn't the pet killing blow stopping your improved DS just a private server thing? Always procced for me, and I've basically never called my pet back when a mob dies. Even used Lash of Pain for the last bit while using DS and still get the proc.
---
I use 4/5 with a 1.2 speed Cat and the proc is up quite often. 2/2 Imp Mend Pet is what I would recommend for leveling.
---
&gt; **how screwed am I?** 
---
I mean..... you messed up and will no longer have an optimally geared character until a later phase. IMO it's an offspec though so who tf cares?
---
10+ of each on my mage, still no loot, im number one on DKP tho
---
Shaman purge is only on enemies I think.
---
I see, you didn't specify that you were only talking about dungeons.
---
"loot councils that don't do what is best for the guild end up with circumstances that are not beneficial for the guild"
---
well..... obviously
---
Saw his path going around killing and skinning.
---
If you have any questions about the data, please ask here and I'll do my best to answer them.
---
I dont see trinks on that list, but according to point values, SHotM is worth 34.5 and Vigilance Charm is worth 33.3.
---
that's not a big enough difference for me to drop a fully leveled profession for a trinket
---
Yeah. I mean if you want to be worse than any other tank possible and limit yourself to the current content for the rest of classic. GO FOR IT.
---
2004
---
Have been running that for a long time and can confirm: this makes for really fast pulls. In essence you get Ignite + improved Flamestrike and batch both the FS and the Coc into a nova. Highest burst AOE dps a mage can do, but also more challenging to play than Blizzard kiting. 
---
Not recommended in instances though. The combo works like an AOE taunt, no matter what the tank does. ;)
---
slow
---
It doesn't go to waste but people who really could use the gear are gonna be passing on it so as to hoard for weapons.
---
Well, the idea is that retail stuff lacks value, which implies a lack of demand and therefore a lack of population or people caring about it. I realize there is already RMT in retail but I would still expect gold sellers to exist at a lower price point.
---
sounds like a circle jerk highschool clique lol nice guild mate
---
I used to work with someone who believed getting 10 pesos for one dollar makes you nine dollars richer.  He was always an idiot but he only believed it was the exchange rate because that's what people always call it.  I'm hoping that maybe if people called it buying power he and others like him wouldn't have gotten confused.
---
Yeah i can definitely see that being an issue in classic. Though i think some form of balance between loyalty and significance of upgrade is still totally possible
---
Healer wont get that sweet mc loot without a healer.
---
Dishonorable kill is the only thing keeping battles from being 500 v 500 which will kill Blizzard's servers in phase 2.
---
Re read the comment you are responding too. 
---
Then explain how you got ‚ÄúToo stupid to tank‚Äù from it. 
---
You are difficult to understand. Your sentence structure is very broken. 
---
What are you trying to say?
---
Kromcrush Alliance only has 15 people in Stormwind. =(
---
We still have a lot of people that are just about to hit 60. I've done quite a few Jailbreak runs with guildies just to get them attuned. Maybe you just need to find a guild that is there to help each other, and not just raid.
---
Am i missing something here? You almost lost but got a fat crit. I thought you were gonna do some 1000iq trick.
---
Offspec potentially with hand of rag... Feelsbadman
---
At least I can be the most scuffed sham ever on my server
---
In a "good" raid it wouldn't matter what you bring. This is WoW Classic...
---
Yeah. Last night (MC Reset) I had a queue of 100. Way down from when WoW Classic first came out and I had 1500 and 50 minutes.
---
indeed i was not. and if that's the case, i sincerely apologize
---
Maybe it was just early vanilla that had this behavior and I just kept doing it out of habit. I do remember having to use this at some point. Never played on private servers.
---
If it's what they enjoy doing... then sure why not? As long as people in the group are ok with it too then there is no issue.
---
Unless you're on a lower pop server or up very late, in my opinion devilsaur is not worth the effort. You're much better off just hitting 60 and learning how to do DM tribute runs.
---
Southshore is the closest alliance fp,  I believe. Or if you're rolling horde to see it it's halfway between tarren mill and undercity
---
A quitter didn‚Äôt even get bis from first raid but cba to keep playing to see more content.
---
I juke
---
I got lucky getting into non full pre made AV‚Äôs with the people actually shooting for 14 a good amount but basically was just grinding for battleground epics a couple hours a day freshman year of college.  I definitely played more than I do now, but nowhere near 12 hours a day.
---
Warsong US
---
&gt; q, e,
---
How do you strafe? Or do you play a 'park-and-cast' class?
---
My first month anniversary was wayyyyyy back onnoctober 3rd. Lol. I'm on thunderfurry or I would def join yeah. I'm hoping to find a alt levelling buddy. It'll be a week yet before I'm 60 as I just hit 53.
---
Yep, so incredibly lucky. He used mana shield, but that only protects against physical attacks, not magical. So if that wand attack wasn't resisted, he'd be dead.
---
You can sheep beasts?
---
Actually BIS for raiding for the entire game. Make sure you're set up in a group with a shaman, your 2 best fury warriors, and a hunter (for true shot aura).
---
Your first point is not necessarily ideal. The GM shouldn't always be MT and RL as well. What if he can't make it? What if he quits?
---
there is no such thing as a reserved item and the idea that there is, is LAUGHABLE.
---
you would remember if you hit r11 or r12, huge difference, and even bigger for r13
---
The WA worked amazing! Thanks again! The only part which I didn't get to work properly was adding the name of the target in the /say. When I tried %t, it did not work sadly... Any idea how to resolve this is issue?
---
Since it makes you so salty, I will!
---
Seeing this actually made my day today!!!!
---
Haha yeah I know, I wasn‚Äôt asking what they were, just questioning why he excluded them from his argument.
---
`how do you turn this on`
---
I really hope they won't release TBC.
---
It doesn't matter how many hours and how long you've played the game. If you hacked they gotta ban you. Plain simple. In your convo with them you go from your actual story to "what if I was hacked". To me it's a pretty weak arguments and I would have done the same thing if I was the GM.
---
You made me count all my keys.
---
102 which includes the number pad on the right and the Function Keys, but I didn't include the Function Mode Toggle key.
---
Holding aggro is the easy part, its the lack of stam and armor thats the real issue.
---
Another demonstration of lack of imagination. You only are capable of thinking in terms of your own experience. 
---
1. It isn‚Äôt over engineering if it has a use case outside of the scope you are thinking of, i.e. posting when not in range of keyboard but in range of microphone.
---
2. It was an example to demonstrate engineering knowledge, even though it is very trivial, but we are talking about taking screenshots here.
---
3. I use several different keyboards since I am fluent in several languages, I mostly type using Roman characters but with different language keyboards, but also a few others, although for Reddit almost exclusively English, I have other accounts where I may use other languages more often. What does this mean? Nothing. I meant to type lick and it autocorrected. But once again, you lack imagination.
---
If they go back and do classic+ that‚Äôs the first change I want
---
You could probably cut back to illumination, but that only gets you 7/8 of your points for plus hit.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2pLuST9mcA looks pretty hard but founda vid of a rogue soloing gonna try it out tommorow
---
I dont use those, i am on benediction which is never full.
---
Still remains an offspec. Every resto should be eligible rolling on eye of ragnaros and carry it into PvP. There you rarely run around with both breadth and HoJ anyways because you often have atleast one situational trinket equipped and the other is reserved for HoJ.
---
No, no cheating.  Adding another to the party.
---
Theres a multiboxer on my server in retail i see wverywhere, theres like 8 druids and they run around in stag form its hilarious
---
/sigh
---
Gold and BoE items are one and the same. If you say I'm greedy because I want the gold to buy my own BiS then it is also greedy to take the item (if it's my characters BiS) because I'm denying everyone else the opportunity to buy their own BiS. We can agree to disagree mate. I am also happy to keep explaining why you are strawmanning my  beliefs.
---
Anything that automates stuff is banned. If you look at the thing they sent they name other stuff that falls under automation and hacking.
---
Please don't say that around my gf. I don't want her to leave me.
---
No harm in that 5% crit on Offhand and daggers tend to be faster. A couple 1.3 and 1.4 speed options.
---
Potential for what? For you to hook up with some random woman (man) from wow, maybe
---
thanks for linking that though! I forgot that it existed
---
Most of the addons were present back then too. You just cant complete a raid with vanilla ui its just not showing enough info for it, even in retail the ui is just not enough.
---
Thanks for the info! I know healing will still be the most in-demand option for PUGs, but I do like the idea of being versatile and I'd love to be able to run some dungeons in a different role.
---
Regarding wands, that's the thing I've been most concerned with keeping up to date at all times. I'm currently using [\[Dancing Flame\]](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6806/dancing-flame), which I got as a quest reward for the Test of Faith chain that started in Thousand Needles and included a trip to SM. Looks like my next upgrade, in the absence of a lucky drop or buying one on the AH, is either the Chillnail Splinter in Dustwallow or buying a white wand from a vendor.
---
Eye play Classic but brows the retail sub
---
Here's a macro.
---
DPS LFG - CAN SUMMON 
---
Works every time.
---
Not your fault in that situation.  Hunter done goofed.
---
Remember kids, 5/5 in shatter is a life saver
---
I'll make sure to think of you daddy wizard
---
Just spam /ataxus or w/e
---
Thank you for youre reply! Im literally about to respec. Like ive only heard good things about fury dps with pve and i trust everyones opinion about that since im only 7 weeks into the game. Thanks again. So why would a player choose arms over fury?
---
OP wasn't asking about the list of every BiS item for every class for every phase. He asked about the concept of BiS.
---
It's quite the crazy mentality. I get that people want to have a good core team that shows up, but it's kinda crazy to me that the norm seems to be "Come help us kill all these bosses. You won't get anything for your time... but hey, a few weeks down the road maybe we'll toss a BoE your direction buddy."
---
My guild was great at start and I'm still a core raid member, but the officers and GM just started loot council and the mentality seems to be changing... It's worrying.
---
I literally got an email today saying I was banned for 180 days too for botting and I have never botted either. Same thing on my main account which has been open for 12 years. WTF
---
So i got banned for taking gaming clips?
---
I would warn you‚Äîdon‚Äôt get discouraged with leveling. I know you said you‚Äôve been busy and that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre only level 25, but there is really no realistic way you can go from 25-60 in a matter of days. Even if your schedule frees up and you play 15 hours a day it will be more than a few days. For your first time ever playing I think anywhere between 10-15 days of time played would be a reasonable amount of time to hit 60.
---
It‚Äôs a long road, but it‚Äôs an amazing journey and you‚Äôll love every moment of it. And while it does get incredibly laborious and grindy at times, it is well worth it.
---
Personally I just skipped devilsaur gear, it's really just min maxing. I have herb and skinning on my Hunter but without layers herb is much more difficult. If you want to pvp take Engineering and whatever else, your main gold will come from tribute runs.
---
Adding another to the party? Lol what are you talking about? A polyamorous relationship? Think you need to really sit and think hard what your marriage with your wife means to you.
---
No idea what that is
---
It says "Use of Bots or Third-Party Automation Software"
---
Is it any faster if a high level is hard carrying quests so it takes significantly less time to complete them or are you missing out on too much of the mob exp for it to make a difference?
---
&gt; It's you that don't understand how hit works buddy, and if you don't even know the fightclub discord then you are by defualt a fucking shitter. I'm done replying to you.
---
lmao yikes
---
Because in classic it actually gives you an advantage.
---
You can buy some mounts in retail with botted gold, therefore you dont really need gold.
---
Botting in classic is a lucrative as it hasnt been for a long, long time. Gold is actually rather hard to come by.
---
What did you use to stay logged in when the queue times were 5 hours?
---
So... a threesome?  
---
Who's going to lead the group?
---
Just go to the AH and find cheap pieces with Int/Stam on them.
---
Don't go overboard though, wouldn't pay more than 5g for any one item, you just need enough to have 6500\~ mana.
---
Oh yeah for sure it exists I just don‚Äôt think blizz wants publicity in that regards
---
Can... Can I have your stuff?
---
Nobody does the quest because even at lvl 60 you get charged from long ranges by large numbwrs of guards that spawn out of nowhere and respawn way too quickly.
---
I never had que times. I am on benediction which is pretty low pop compared to others
---
&gt; QS is the best tank weapon because it gives you stats.
---
oh reddit.
---
Haha that name though
---
It sounds like you already don't worry about anyone but yourself.
---
"Son I want you to understand this divorce is not your fault, Mommy and Daddy still love you very very much. It's just that I really needed that mageblade and to get priority I had to do things that Mommy did not approve of..."
---
It's very possible. In their system they could probably tell you were accessing the automation software but they have no way to tell what it was being used for. So in their book they just ban you for using it.
---
Well I‚Äôm leveling the character and that grind from 14-60 is gonna be time consuming. Anything that makes that more efficient can‚Äôt possibly be a bad thing. The most useful macro I‚Äôve found for myself is /castsequence spell/spell/spell/wand. I used to have to press each individual spell separately after each other. Now with the macro I press 1 hot key and the spell rotation happens on its own. I went from spamming the same 4 keys to just one. To me that super efficient. A quality of life issue. 
---
The tool tips thing I‚Äôm not an expert on. I think it has something to do with it showing you the spell it‚Äôs macrod to before you press it? Not sure on that one.
---
Yes, and the concept is that they are "really good items"
---
This is wayyy more than 40v40 and that is going to be more spread out than this is.  Blizz servers could handle AV 12 years ago it should be just fine.
---
As for new people not hopping on discord In my own personal experience in my guild the raiders all have their own groups of friends and other discords that they hang out in, or they're in a raiders only channel or they're in the retail discord that the classic crew doesn't have access too.
---
They dont show evidence, so botters don't find the loopholes and figure out how they got caught. 
---
Would you tell your opponent how you beat him in poker in detail, so he can prepare and beat you in the next round?
---
It was a good play with some luck when the odds were stacked against him.
---
I‚Äôd like to see actual math on Shaman tanking with:
---
 Shield Specialization
---
Anticipation 
---
Toughness 
---
Parry 
---
Guardian Totems 
---
..and Rockbiter Weapon + Earth Shock every cool down for Threat and Upgraded Stoneskin Totem + Healing Stream running on you full time.  
---
Don‚Äôt forget Mail armor + maxed Armor Kits in all 4 slots, and the awesome fact that Shammy can Reincarnate mid fight. 
---
I bet they could OT with this build as well as any Druid.
---
Lol I‚Äôll keep this saved for when I start dungeons
---
Thank you for your input and yes I do the same as you when looking to group with someone. I‚Äôll help kill their mob or ask if they need food or water since I can make it free as a mage! :)
---
so then wouldnt it be fair for me to ask why i got banned.
---
thats impressive but way too much work with a razor thin margin of error
---
So my built in keyboard macros are bannable. cool lol
---
Not sure of your class but sounds like you're getting fucked lol.
---
Don't forget to fatm those shards and a Headmaster's Charge for all your gnomies.
---
Any dungeon is the worst to shaman tank.
---
Honestly having a feral dps is great! 
---
Some bosses you just *need* another tank or healer. And a DPS with a res is great!
---
A fair point. That is a bit extreme of him. I probably could of worded my post better. I am genuinely curious to what a player thinks when they attack a lower leveled player.
---
But retail will always make more money
---
Your wife has issues.
---
VNC viewer and control your computer from your phone.
---
it literally says "bots or other cheat software".This can be actual bots, flyhacks such as Glider which was banned many moons ago, autoclicker, kickbots etc.
---
Spoken like a true DPS
---
Have you tried cancel casting. Ie if your a tank healer you should be casting heals but cacel them before cast if they will overheal. It‚Äôs more proactive instead of reactive.
---
They dont have to show me lol. they could say the type of software. I dont know but the point is that i didnt do anything i havnt been doing for 10 years. not like i have alot of gold or anything.
---
the bloodlust buff I imagine if it procs at least once during the fight the sword was worth it, as for the +50 stats that seems a bit iffy. All in all I'd use the sword if I had it just for the fun RNG factor of it lol but I'd accept that it is probably no where near consistent enough to be a 100% upgrade
---
Ah gotcha. I figured it didnt when I was logged for 20 minutes in DM library and came back on in the same spot. Good to know for future afk farming at work. Can do a run, afk and be productive, then come back for another
---
It would definitely speed up questing, but you would miss out on a huge chunk of exp that you get from killing mobs while questing. 
---
You would eventually run out of quests available for your level and would hit a point where you just need to grind out exp in the world or dungeon to catch back up.
---
To be more specific about those raiding advantages. Alliance has fear ward and enhanced sword/mace skills for humans. The latter becomes less of a deal later on, but it does lessen the gear demand.
---
Horde has Taurens. :)
---
Arcanite Reaper is still usually low pop.  Especially horde side
---
No, it says "use of bots or THIRD PARTY AUTOMATION SOFTWARE" if you are using keyboard macros for automation then yeah that's why you were banned....
---
I dont even have alot of gold lol. 165gold with 60% mount and the money is from 2 boe epics i sold
---
Oh shucks, I'm playing a rogue.
---
She has a penis.
---
You know what I mean.
---
As a perma-tank, I can tell you from my point of view that Priests using Mind Blast or Mind Control are one of the only things that ever pull aggro off me and I can never get it back.
---
I don't know what you mean.
---
Please could you spell it out.
---
‚ÄúBut I didn‚Äôt do it‚Äù
---
-every person ever who did it
---
fuck both
---
I dont use any of these things. i have something to make clips, twitch addons and thats it.
---
So there's some REALLY good stuff in Arms. I'm a big fan of Tactical Mastery &amp; Anger Management as this allows you to stance dance. Deep Wounds is also great as is Improved Overpower.
---
In lower levels I personally feel like Arms is the better tree because I like to tank dungeons. With the option for stance dancing provided by lower level arms talents, this gives me more flexibility in dungeons. Now I can go from defensive to battle and mocking blow. Otherwise it would be changing stances, waiting for the rage, and then mocking blow. Terrible when you have no rage when switching stances.
---
From sweeping strikes and below I feel like is further specialized into 2h damage with Mortal Strike being specifically tailored towards PvP. Big crits &amp; reduced healing are great for any PvP environment. Having Mortal Strike while leveling can allow you to burst down a healer if able.
---
You are so fun
---
Our guild does sign ups with a benching system but loot is silent auction dkp bidding with roll off for ties. Invites are sent to first 40 people who sign up. If you are benched you are free to not only pug that week assuming the raids finished before youre saved to the lock out but you also gain partial boss kill credit for every boss downed while youre benched.
---
So far its worked really well this past month.
---
&gt; example: banking dkp for absolute bis, not accepting loot because it'd take away dkp
---
I never liked DKP systems that used a set-price system for loot. A DKP system that auctions each item is great for a raiding guild when content isn't too challenging (imo): the regular guys earn enough points to buy what they want first, but they'll pay a premium over the not-so-regular guys. Then when the same loot drops again, it will be cheaper for others. Sometimes loot can go for 1 point because nobody bid any more on it. If so, that's a bargain for that person. I was in a guild that did that during BC. Great times were had, and loot was distributed more evenly and fairly than I've ever seen in a raiding guild before or since.
---
No, because it is their policy to not discuss bans. That is their right as a company and is in the terms of agreement you virtually signed/accepted when you made an account.
---
Wow! Thank you so much. I learned a lot from your input! Thanks for the encouragement, it is kinda saddening sometimes while I watch YouTube vids or a twitch stream of WoW and they‚Äôre always raiding and having lots of fun! Can‚Äôt wait to be able to raid and fight bosses. I‚Äôve ALWAYS loved the idea of killing the same boss or mob over and over and over again until I got that certain drop I wanted. I‚Äôve been watching leveling guides and MOST tell you to kill everything on your way to quests and to also take a few levels here and there of just strictly killing mobs.
---
1. Cut the expansion-long grind (AP)
---
2. Compress servers and restore some sense of community
---
3. Drop the multi-dungeon &amp; raid difficulties. Normal Heroic Mythic M+ is 4 levels of dungeon. LFR Normal Heroic Mythic is 4 levels of raid. Cut to 2 each to cull the power creep. 
---
4. Tier sets return and M+ gets their own tier which will usually involve CC or AoE boosts bonuses 
---
5. No RNG on gear. 
---
6. Restore classes / talent trees to something good
---
Bonuses:
---
- more rpg elements
---
- fix the super fucked economy 
---
- fix professions 
---
- bring back pvp power &amp; resilience
---
well i honestly didnt know and too be honest that doesnt really give me an advantage other than to save funny moments
---
Rockbiter and Earth Shock cause massive threat and say so on the tooltip.  
---
Tab target rotation with melee attacks + shock should hold threat.
---
Can you not read? It literally says in the email they sent you why you were banned. You were using automation software which is against the terms and services YOU agree to when playing their games.....
---
No. The concept is that they are "the best item" during a phase or pre-raid etc.
---
It's shorthand for "best in slot", not "really good in slot".
---
I was making fun of you taking your raiding in classic so seriously. You posting logs only cements that. I agree with your point about the shield. 
---
Btw, it's should HAVE/wouldn't HAVE. Not should of/wouldn't of.
---
Sir you are a godsend
---
I would assume this is just mindless trolling in pugs. Also if the Ony buff is the only thing keeping a warrior above a warlock on the meters, that warrior needs to do a serious self evaluation. Warriors should crush Warlocks on the meters
---
Ah yes sometimes I fail to see it from others perspective. But if efficiency if what you want then this is def the way to go.
---
 I'm a priest and though I have a rotation like yourself I am often changing it up just because. Sometimes I'll open with SWP and just wand down other times I'll fully open to try and kill mob as fast as possible. Sometimes I'll pull 3-5 mobs to challenge myself. Sometimes I just spam mindflay. 
---
 The very little time I get to play the game I like to be immersed and rushing through everything just seems a sure way to burn yourself out of the game. But like you say the 14-60 grind is what makes some other Burn out cause rubbing the same 4-5 dungeons over and over and over again is appealing to them cause of the potential award. 
---
 I havnt gotten there yet but the closer I get the more I believe the wow endgame isn't for me and I just love the levelling aspect.
---
Listen I hate retail as much as the next person, but that is the truth. Activisions only focus is money and they will cut and gut everything to make maximum profit with minimum effort
---
Yup. Warlock/Mage are worst pally nightmare.

---
Theres the furry erp I‚Äôve come to expect.
---
Also, unless a boss prevents bears from tanking, a bear does the same threat as a fury prot who is enraged. Bears may take more damage than deep prot but they do take less damage than fury prot. With added DPS or utility if not needed.
---
No druid bias promise.
---
&gt;Are there any important drops for a mage in brs? 
---
A few:
---
- Skyshroud Leggings are the BiS pants from LBRS   
---
- Briarwood Reed from Jed is BiS trinket from UBRS  
---
- Trindlehaven staff is nice, it drops from the final LBRS boss    
---
- A quest starting in LBRS and ending in UBRS gives the Eye of the Beast BiS trinket  
---
- Hands of Power are BiS gloves from LBRS
---
This reminds me of some yung gravy lyrics:  "Now my girls booty got me looking like a midget."
---
My first mc in classic was as a 57 lock :D literally only brought along to be a iimp buff/curse of elements/banish bot.
---
What system is that you show there in the screenshot
---
So then we‚Äôll see you in 6 months :D
---
bruh.... are....you....serious.... XD. you are lucky indeed
---
Feral Druid has the most fun raid rotation in the game IMO. Between timing your powershifts to get max energy ticks, incorporating claws/4-pt bites if you get dodged, managing your mana with pots/demonic runes, and all the while keeping crowd pummeler buff up there‚Äôs a decent amount of decision making to think about. You can even top charts if you‚Äôre dedicated enough!
---
Where is the rune of dawn?
---
Oh wtf. Are bots coming back? :(
---
Its very very good, the TBC expansion is pretty much required at least for the dungeons.
---
I feel like we just get each other.
---
Play the race that you like better, but if you like both: gnome.
---
I guess I‚Äôve never played through the entire board game, so I wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell. It seems really cool though!
---
Better than a Druid who gets a crush rolled on them and stays dead while the raid wipes. 
---
Popping up 1 second later and hitting a high threat skill is a pretty neat trick.
---
Lol I wont be back TBH if this is the case. I didnt bot or cheat i just have stuff to make funny clips with my friends and this has been a huge waste of time thought someone could help me out but its just a cluster fuck.
---
and which ones are those so I can become the baron of my server? 
---
I already made a bet on disgusting oozelings going up later, and I am willing to make some more bets during content drought.
---
That's fair enough, but don't come in here acting like you don't know why you are banned when the email states the reason and you are admitting to using automation. 
---
You may not have realized that's banable but it's in their ToS and they can't tell what else you may be using it for.
---
If you legit have not used it for anything have you called their phone support? I had to do that years back when my account was hacked and they would not give it back to me via support tickets. You may be able to get them to be more lenient there if their logs show nothing else suspicious but at the end of the day they are well within their rights to not remove the ban at this point.
---
I mean your not the only class with that problem but that‚Äôs the trade off of being a healer or tank. You could always respec shadow for phase two and heal offspev if your guilds cool with it. Personally I live dungeon crawling so my time between raids is spent gearing new 60s or running my core friends for their final pbis.

What add on to make health bar go there
---
That is how economics works. That is not how YOU play the game because you don't make rational decisions with your gold and gear. That doesn't change the objective fact that it is indeed how economics works. 
---
If you would like to learn more: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost
---
Why is everyone so aggro. Yes you are right but still sucks cause i didnt do anything wronglol
---
**Opportunity cost**
---
In microeconomic theory, the opportunity cost, or alternative cost, of making a particular choice is the value of the most valuable choice out of those that were not taken. When an option is chosen from alternatives, the opportunity cost is the "cost" incurred by not enjoying the benefit associated with the best alternative choice.  The New Oxford American Dictionary defines it as "the loss of potential gain from other alternatives when one alternative is chosen."
---
In simple terms, opportunity cost is the benefit not received as a result of not selecting the next best option. 
---
Opportunity cost is a key concept in economics, and has been described as expressing "the basic relationship between scarcity and choice".
---
i just did that in one of the biggest guilds in the server. I joined knowing nobody, joined some 5man and UBRS groups. Familiarized myself on discord. Showed that I am easygoing and not selfish, I share consumes I pass on loot if its a bigger upgrade for someone else. After a couple of weeks I'm pretty much first in line to fill the last 10 just from establishing a positive reputation for myself.
---
We do have signup sheets and everything but there's still the random fills that happen from time to time. People don't wanna sign up that's just another part of the same issue.
---
Sure you can get away with less, but I would rather solidify myself as a decent guy and team player. 
---
As someone who makes only $40k a year doing labor I have no problem being a team player and its just a personality thing, some people only give a shit about themselves and their own day/struggle. Maybe it's blue collar culture but we have no problem working together to make the day easier so I don't see your analogy unless it's an office environment thing you're talking about.
---
*cries in Warden Staff*
---
Very simple actually. To start off with, we have a set amount of raider spots for each class and whenever there is a vacancy, we recruit from within the guild at first and if there are no suitable candidates, we have a open recruitment. We don't really use "applications" or anything like that, we just take in whoever's interested and sort out the shitters from the gems.
---
As we have the resources to run 4 raids (2 pugs 2 core raids), we can have trialists run with the guild pugs at first for a week or two. Usually have a few of our CLs on alts as well to ensure that the pug raids go smoothly and complete under 2 hours, they can guide the newbies through tactics and which consumables to use when and whatnot. A soft landing for the trialists before we put them into the heat, you know.
---
This allows us to get trustworthy logs and we can take a look at their initial preparation and performance in a semi optimal environment, and they get some gear hopefully. Our pugs use a +1 roll system with class prios so e.g. hunters cant roll on BRE or any of that shit, so chances of the trialists getting gear there is very high.
---
If they're doing alright there, we get them into our core raids and see how they parse up in a optimal environment. We look at their preparedness (e.g. being ready on time with consumables, and when/how they use them), performance and ability use (e.g. are you sticking to your assigned debuff or not) and such. We look at parses too and take into account what they were assigned to do in the raid, we understand that a tank healer might not be parsing 95% in most cases.
---
Depending on the case we run them for 2-3 weeks before we make the decision, during which they're basically considered full members that get attendance and loot just like everyone else. Trialists have a few caveats on loot distribution though, such as top bis like BRE/spinal etc. not being available to them until they pass their trial, however in general all tier gear and offpieces etc are still up for grabs and we do tend to routinely gear out our promising trialists with tier gear, even if it means we're taking away something from the core raiders (as long as its not a huge upgrade that some core raiders really deserve). We think of it as a investment and our core raiders agree because they understand that the further we go in the game, the greater our need for new blood and new blood ain't gonna stick around if they're treated like crap.
---
If they're good, they get a raider spot and that is that, welcome to paradise for as long as you'd like. If not, their class leader has a chat with them where they go through logs and see how they could improve their performance. They can then try again and see if they can get better parses or atleast improve their performance, or they can become socials who are very welcome to keep raiding in our pugs, or they can join some other guild if they wish. Short description but I guess you get the idea.
---
There is a skip for horde that people figured out on private servers to get past the alliance choke point on the bridge if the horde group up to push it.
---
 but your racing against alliance with basically a straight line once you get past the mines next to the horse mini boss.
---
Ok im going to log in soon and tell you what i have and id love to hear your opinion on it and i tell you my mind set behind each point i used and which abilities i use/dont and also would love your feedback. Also ill provide my rotations for dps and tank. Ill send you that stuff once i get on my pc!
---
The premise is that the dualwield warrior has solid gear, otherwise dualwielding will suck the healer dry and actually lengthen the run.
---
So he has good gear, therefore he is probably right in there with the other 3 DPS making him the 4th DPS.
---
You often have another melee, therefore as long as the healer has mana, you just keep going with the other melee while the casters drink.
---
Therefore a normal pack of 2-3 elites often look like this:
---
burst them down with good 4 DPS player damage, healer is at 80% mana, casters are at 50%, melees (you and the DPS melee) are ready to go as always.
---
Now comes the enhancement shaman who has to drink more than the healer, probably even more than the mages and warlocks just dragging out the run.
---
Healing a well geared warrior topping the DPS and tanking is a blast (healed as resto shaman before). Healing a paladin or shaman is just tedious as you have to wait for mana on the TANK - no fun.
---
I've read all the comments in this thread, and if you're wondering why Blizzard made dungeons significantly shorter and linear immediately starting with TBC, this is why.    I didn't play vanilla, but ran the dungeons in wrath.  Never liked them for leveling, except scarlet crusade.   I was constantly told they were so much fun back in the day.  Now that I'm in classic, no, no they're not, and that's not even counting all the extra time you need to spend just getting into them.  And as far as I can tell, people hate running them, they avoid them unless there's a piece of gear they really really need.   Every large dungeon is sliced and diced into smaller linear chunks (especially BRD).  I've only ever seen the 4 SCs spammed by people.     I've heard people call BRD iconic (I don't get it really, it's just moria from LoTR sort of), but every one acts like BRD is the plague.
---
Do you use keyboard macros too like the OP does?
---
Yea I wouldn‚Äôt expect you to come back either.
---
I‚Äôm not sure what kind of help you were looking to get. Maybe let‚Äôs all make a petition on change.org and demand they unban you because you use addons to make funny videos with your friends?
---
At least you can watch other people play the game on twitch though üòå
---
I didnt think of my macro for 30 clips was in their ToS. If thats what really banned me I wont make clips but this seems really silly.
---
Implying the average player doesn‚Äôt just park in their preferred form for the whole dungeon.
---
But when used well, yeah, Druid is amazingly versatile.
---
Guild stealth run, or friend stealth run. Basically, don't expect to get it unless you can trust people to run with you after they get theirs from your effort. You can do it with 3 rogues easily or 2 rogues with a little finesse. Rogue and bear also make an easy 2 man. You can do 5 kills in 25 minutes and you can get a group willing to spend all day doing it.
---
I started these for my guild and was present for 8 drops (including my own) over the course of 97 stealth runs. If I did it full pug, I would never have received as my eventual winning roll was a 2. We are now at a point where when a new rogue or bear hits 60, we help him out and they don't have competition to worry about.
---
Get every rogue and druid involved in stealth runs now. There are a significant number of bosses you can take down with 2 to 3 rogues and druids. Like, 80% of 5-man bosses, without any trash, and fast enough to outpace reset timer.
---
Not at all! I got the Truefaith on my priest a few days ago. One guy asked if we should all need, I pointed out the fact that I didn't have it, and they all passed it to me. Granted the pattern is only around 40-50g on my server but they were super chill about it!
---
2+hunters then they should get a hunters mark IF ifs only 1 then no
---
Warrior was my first and there were wit rough spots but you make money just fine.  Make friends and have them spot you 15g for the mount if you need it and you'll be able to pay them back just a couple days later.
---
Taz Dingo!
---
It's real and viable.  Not optimal, sure... but it's real.  They have a lot of threat generating abilities and single target when BIS can actually pull more threat than a warrior.  They're extremely viable in pretty much all 5 man content, sure AOE threat isn't great but as long as you are a good leader and mark targets (and the group hit them), the group won't pull aggro off you. 
---
Not everyone wants to fit into the cookie cutter classes and spec.  Not everyone wants to be a Warrior or Druid.  I'm literally only considering classic for the chance to play a Shaman Tank, nothing else is drawing me to it.
---
Also, I've seen videos of a shaman tanking bosses like Alextrasa in BWL.  Videos of shamans tanking almost all 5 man dungeons up to and including endgame content.  It's certainly possible... Just because you don't like it, doesn't mean anything.
---
I have respect for anyone that is knowingly bad at PvP but still plays on PvP servers. Kudos regardless
---
I think im just gunna kill myself too be honest. I dont know what help i was looking for im just sad and frustated cause this has been my favorite game. This whole thing sucks especially when i didnt actually cheat

Yeah like the other guy said. When you said multiple layers I thought you meant 3+ but I guess you just meant 2. But it is good to know more than 4 or so servers are 2 layers each.

'Didnt do anything i haven't been doing for 10 years' isn't the same as 'haven't been doing something against terms of service.' Is there something you let slip through the cracks because it became normal to you?

Because of how you approached this post, you came in here acting 100% innocent/smug/like blizz is wrong and ignoring the entire part of that email about automation and just focusing on how you didn't bot.
---
These posts pop up frequently like this where the OP insists he is 100% innocent and blizz is evil and 99% of the time they eventually admit they have done something that would warrant the ban.

I used the Reddit to destroy the Reddit

I would say run them and check your chat window as you kill them to see who gives what amount. Biggest thing I can say is don't forget your trinket.

wait, people actually ganking people of similar levels? what is this magic?

Lol my naming convention was Eazytank eazy bank eazyports etc. works great except when I wanna be logged in secretly in guild.

Providing you draw enough threat, why do you need a taunt?  Mobs will still stick to you providing your group can hit marked targets.
---
Works much better if you add in sweeping strikes after charge.
---
&gt;loot counsel

What, you mean you give loot to your friends and then give counselling to people who missed out?

I think you might mean *council* mate.

---
Here's a pro tip that I've used while leveling. I kinda stopped at 40 to use Mortal Strike with Whirlwind Axe.
---
In PvE (solo), if your rage is say 60 or higher, use heroic strike to dump the rage. Otherwise, use Sunder Armor.
---
Heroic Strike replaces your next auto attack. That same heroic strike gives you ZERO rage. Sunder Armor reduces the targets armor, increasing the damage you do to it (so you get more rage from each hit). Additionally, it doesn't interrupt your swing timer and so you still auto attack for rage. Lastly, it can also miss! Introduce Overpower.
---
That's a tough question. I don't think you can assume that a 3% increase in attack power is a 3% increase in DPS because it ignores your base weapon DPS. 
---
Assuming your base weapon DPS is 50:
---
DPS after 1000 AP = 50 + (1000/14) = 121.43
---
DPS after 1030 AP = 50 + (1030/14) = 123.57
---
Which is a 1.76% increase.
---
So in theory the weapon skill is still probably a little better against bosses, but Bonescraper would be better against anything that's not a L63 boss. 
---
You could try using a simulator -- I'm not sure which to recommend I haven't tried using a sim yet in classic.
---
We may be forming our own guild. Not sure yet. Waiting to see what the rest of our friends group wants to do. Thank you for the advice. I‚Äôll be sure to mention that to them.
---
Spent (way) too much time working on this ... for classic I wanted something that kept some of the classic vibe while still hiding a lot of the UI *stuff* that seems to take over the screen. 
---
The (Bartender) action button layout matches the Razer keypad I use, the whole game font was replaced with Skurri, Shadowed Unit Frames for the player/target/party frames, Details for the damage meters, Prat for the chat (center of screen to stop me missing party messages while tanking, fades away after 20s, stops below the bottom of the action bars), sexymap for the minimap, Kui nameplates, NameplatesSCT for the combat dmg text, WeakAuras for the rage bar/swing timer ... and a bunch of others. Everything where possible is using the 'minimalist' bar style.
---
Hope you like it!
---
What you say sums it up perfectly. A guild that have people ready and on time but thinks it's ok to randomly select people for the last spot vice pre-selection. People have other things to do aside from this game and while they would love to raid with their guild no one wants to log in to waste time. There is a difference between knowing ahead of time that you only get a spot if someone doesn't make it and logging on in hopes the whims of the masters are good to let you in the raid.  
---
Loot Council is trash, and it sounds like their guild is the primary reason LC is trash because they are there for their friends and cliques. Even if its not there is always some bias when you use LC no matter how hard you try, and if for some reason your guild have zero bias during LC, it never looks that way to those who are left out. In this case though new raiders are basically stuck with leftover or non-bis upgrades. In a full raid guild, I put Loot Council under /roll as far as fairness goes.  
---
Guild leadership seems like trash though, instead of fixing their problems he comes here to air his dirty laundry. If you can't utilize your members kick them and quit wasting their time, people join a raid guild to raid. If you want a tight-knit community that also raids then figure out a better way aside from just recruiting willy nilly.
---
Do not use t clap. Make marks, charge in, use demo, sunder main target immediately
---
Raid! Woh woh woh buddy you ain‚Äôt ever seeing the inside of a raid. And I don‚Äôt think you know how threat works.
---
Except you just enforce the rule you cant use dkp on non sense like that unless no one truly needs and that very rarely happens anyways.
---
Sounds like everybody should G quit
---
I'd like to see your argument for fury warrior being better than a Shaman tank in 5 mans.  Keep in mind that taunt really doesn't mean much providing you're topping the threat meters.
---
I guess my macro for making 30 sec video clips I dont know thats why im confused with zero answers.
---
You've drawn a line between cheap boes and expensive boes. With that line drawn, it's not possible to justify that it's because of the boe status. It's because of the value of the item.
---
BiS is actually Treants Bane.
---
Go solo tribute runs and use Barb blade until bane drops
---
Thanks! I've seen a handful of items so far (highest dungeons I've run have been SM Cath and RFD) that only give +Healing, rather than +Spell Power, but it's not many so far.
---
There has to be a WeakAuras for this.
---
Listed them all in another comment ... but Shadowed Unit Frames are what's showing the player/target/target of target and party health.
---
That site definitely has inaccuracies. For instance, Grizzle is listed as having no resistances, but he's definitely highly resistant to frost.
---
I disagreed with DM coming out. Not because I wasn't ready. But because of the item power creep. So many items replace what was pre-bis before.
---
MC is already easy enough with the current talent tree we didn't need more power creep.
---
Ah there you are, number one.
---
Who‚Äôs the bot?
---
ANY kind of macros and automation is banable.
---
They don't know what you are using this for.
---
MC wasn‚Äôt meant to be hard. If I‚Äôm not mistaken, it was thrown together in a weeks time by devs as an ‚Äúoh no people are hitting level cap faster than expected and there‚Äôs nothing to do at 60‚Äù
---
Content phases are meant to stretch out classics life span. If Blizz catered to the zoom zoom mentality, classic would bleed players a lot faster. People like OP can just unsub til next content patch tbh, I want classic to last
---
Spec Arms, put on a 2 hander, charge, sweeping strikes, whirlwind. If your healer can manage, keep agro with damage instead of trying to taunt/sunder. You trying to 1h+shield is not compatible with the way the DPD are playing.
---
It‚Äôs actually phase 7 when it gets released.
---
Indeed. And the idea that Tokens are good because they put these guys out of business is silly. Put a *good* password on your account and authenticate, the system should remain as closed as possible.
---
I'm just surprised you dated a girl named Holyroller6767
---
She got jumped by a higher level while fighting a mob. Aggroed a second mob and still managed to kill her ganker. That's pretty good.
---
You're attempting to rationalize an illogical position. Seriously. You're trying to bury the fact that BOEs=gold with irrelevant concepts like drop chances and armor classes.
---
It doesn't MATTER if it "evens out over time". If you willingly give up gold (or BOEs) to someone else without taking your chance at winning, the fact that you may be on the receiving end of the same situation in the future doesn't change the fact that you gave up your fair chance at gold to give it to someone else, and others are now giving up their fair chance at gold, to give you the gold.
---
Don't give up your 20% chance at gold in hopes that someone else will do the same thing for you in the future. Take that 20% chance, EVERY TIME, and encourage others to do the same. It is the ONLY truly fair and equal way to handle BOEs.
---
I agree, now that i know this lol. Classic wow is the only game that has a problem with this? I have been using it on OW for years
---
I have very fond memories of raiding Molten Core, as it was the first raid I ever did way back 15 years ago. That said, Vanilla (or Classic in this case) only gets better and better. Molten Core is very trivial compared to the raids to come, and while it may feel like you are missing out, there is plenty of content waiting for you, and everyone, as the new phases gets pushed out.
---
&gt;I‚Äôve ALWAYS loved the idea of killing the same boss or mob over and over and over again until I got that certain drop I wanted.
---
I can‚Äôt tell if that‚Äôs sarcastic or not lol. When you boil it down to just that it seems rather... mundane and monotonous. But I love it and hopefully you will too. 
---
As far as killing everything in your path on the way to an objective/quest, yes you *should* do it, but it‚Äôs certainly not required. It just means you‚Äôll have to grind a little more later. The way I look at it is if I‚Äôm not enjoying it, I won‚Äôt do it. I‚Äôll grind some more mobs at a different time, or come back later, or skip it all together and run a few more dungeons to catch up on the missed experience.
---
WoW leveling is very linear‚Äîyou start at 1 and you go to 60, but how you fill those levels and what you choose to do is totally and completely up to you. It‚Äôs a big world and it‚Äôs yours to explore.

Its not but you make it sound like PvP is *just* that. Its not fun to be on the receiving end but its fun when you're the inflicting party.
---
This will not work in classic. Macros have no way to detect your swingtimer .
---
I can‚Äôt comment on the badlands guy so not sure sorry! I know they‚Äôre used in engineering, hence the price
---
thank you so much
---
I didnt know my 30 sec clip macro for videos was against ToS. It makes sense but like thats a little harsh for something that isnt cheating
---
I think a lot of this was solved back when raiding guilds were expected to have applications and greater barriers to join. If someone went to the trouble of applying, that was a good indication of their dedication. And as part of the application process, red flags (reasons you might not want to invest in them), could be spotted and weeded out before that person ever even stepped into a raid.
---
Now pretty much anyone with a pulse can join a guild, and that evaluative process has just been moved to their performance (and sociability) within the raids themselves.
---
Obviously that leads miffed feelings, when someone joins a guild assuming they'll be treated inclusively like a "full" member right off the bat. Not knowing that the barriers to become a "full" member of a guild still exist, only now they are less explicit, lacking clear metrics, usually subject to a lot more individual partiality.

Try stance swapping to ‚Äòzerker and use a WW instead of a thunderclap. Also make sure to mark targets

People are "aggro" because ignorance does not equal innocence. You had everything provided to you (whether you chose to read it or not) and are now trying to complain about the process because "you didn't know" and  are trying to get a company to go around their policies because yours is supposedly some special circumstance? It isn't. Large companies cannot and do not operate the way you are wanting.

Yes it sucks you were banned if you truly weren't using keyboard macros to give you any advantage, but if you were not aware keyboard macros were a bannable offense then that is on you not them and they are not required to provide any proof or to discuss/appeal it with you.
---
‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt add the stuff people didn‚Äôt like‚Äù
---
Which people? Go to general discussion on the official site and see what ‚Äúthe people‚Äù don‚Äôt like. 
---
The hard part of ...well anything for the public.. is choosing who to cater to. Not so cut and dry here.
---
The problem is, I don't think we have a more neutral word for gay men than b√∂g. Except for maybe "homosexuel". But that stands for homosexual.
---
Well, obviously, but that necessitates that the person is arms. What I posted works for any flavor of warrior. Also, sometimes no. If you're starting the fight with zero rage, there's a non-zero chance that after popping Sweeping you won't have rage to Whirlwind. You've got plenty of time to get sweeping up before your second WW cast. Kinda depends on your group how you go about it at that point.
---
I used to get them all the time in the start zones, but once i put this blocker on, maybe once after I login.
---
Thanks for that.  I've found a guide showing the BIS for shamans, and they're able to reach around 340 from just items... not sure exactly how this translates when adding in talents to increase armor, etc.
---
Shamans can also reach the same health pools as druids, which while this doesn't exactly help with damage mitigation from crits, it does mean that they should be able to survive one if crit from 100% hp (or close to).
---
I do wish there was more in their kit for tanking and that blizzard had actually fleshed out the idea a bit more.  With vanilla/classic, alliance had 3 tanks, and horde had 2 (with shaman being the potential third).  It would have made sense to flesh them out more and make them completely viable tanks.
---
That being said, although they're not OPTIMAL, they're viable in a lot of content.  Including (and I've seen videos on this) main tanking Alextrasa in BWL
---
Holy jeebus, that orc has some bitties. Marketing made a smooth move including that.
---
I do 5 mans all the time with guildies to help them get gear and go out of the way to find Jed when we do UBRS to help people get attuned. I spend my time how I like it, and will help people who hang out in discord calls more than the people expecting raid spots when they hit 60.
---
I don't really play overwatch so I am not sure, but it's pretty standard in any MMO to avoid automation\\third party tools of any kind.
---
Fireball does not infact reset threat completely or at least she doesn't work methodically down the threat list. I healed Ony for my guild last week and watched one of our warlocks eat 3 fireballs back to back. So either 1) it's a threat reduction not a threat wipe and he had a shitload more threat than anyone else in the raid, or 2) completely random fireball targets and he just drew the short straw, 3 times in a row.....
---
Either way, the Onyxia threat mechanics are wack. Biggest advice for OP is to just make sure no one is damaging Ony at the transition. This means no dots! Any damage will pull threat and she'll rampage around. What I've heard from a guildie as a strategy is to make everyone stop casting dots before she transistions, and then once all the dots are off, have only the hunters push her into phase 3. As she lands all the hunters should feign to drop threat while the tank picks her up and gets her to position at which point dps can start burning her once the MT has a threat lead.
---
You should be able to color those procs separately in miks
---
I disagree with this. Imo a faster weapon is best.
---
Faster weapons lower the punishment for being parried or dodged, or missing; especially when opening. Not much is worse than whiffing on your first swing with a slow weapon. Then watching the mobs run passed you cause you have no rage for 2.5s.
---
Faster weapons generate rage more smoothly. With big white hits you get more rage per hit, making it more likely for each attack to generate rage over cap, wasting it. 
---
More frequent sources of rage in smaller doses means you can spend it sooner and have the resource available to react quicker. 
---
Bursty rage generation simply makes it harder to spend rage effectively. 
---
&gt;The slower your weapon is, the more value you get from heroic strike
---
While its true that part of the extra threat generated by heroic strike is based on the damage, the other part is a flat value. If you can afford to hs every swing, you'll get more tps out of a faster weapon. If you can't afford to hs each swing you'll get more threat out of each individual heroic strike with a slower weapon. 
---
But a slower weapon makes heroic strike more expensive, since the cost of heroic strike has to include the rage you didnt generate on that auto attack. 
---
Finally the faster the weapon the more rage per second you can dump, increasing the damage and threat you can output that much more. 
---
Imo when all other considerations are equal always take the faster weapon.
---
Yus I really hope OP has changed password and any other accounts like bank that uses same password/email.
---
A problem is also that a lot of stats are "wasted" on the R13 gear by allotting it to stamina. Health can be increased by a lot of different things in the game and you dont need that much to begin with as a fury. 
---
Now you waste way too much stats on stamina that could be hit/crit/AP.
---
You can make macros in game, EVERY MMO TOS says THIRD PARTY programs that automate ANYTHING are bannable. Rip your 10yr account!
---
Problem is often that the officers and guild leader think they're putting in more because they have clearer visibility of them and their own friends rather than the others.
---
Because some dungeons are actually fun to run..  not in classic, but I enjoyed a lot of dungeons in other xpats.  I was fully geared bear tank from SOO, but I still ran LFR ToT because I *loved* pulling all the trash mobs to the first boss while most the raid was way behind me.   At first people freaked out and thought I was trolling until they realized I was still alive when they got there.  Then they locked in for a quick fun run.
---
Here‚Äôs what I do that seems to work well:
---
Mark main target skull, 2nd target X, 3rd and/or 4th unmarked. Tell DPS at beginning to clear in that order.
---
Charge, demo, sunder skull, tab to next, sunder/revenge, tab to 3rd and/or 4th sunder/revenge. 
---
Save 1st taunt for skull if DPS pulls it away while you are doing above. Once sufficient threat is built of skull is blown up, make another rotation, then focus on X, then unmarked.
---
I honestly don't mind limiting myself to content if it means I can do Shaman tanking - which I've wanted to do for a LONG time.
---
Or just [install this.](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/letmecast)
---
True, but Addons should! There are plenty of Addons that show you the Swingtime values, therefore there has to be one that returns you a value instead
---
Haste? A parry results in an instant counter attack, effectively resetting the swing timer. 
---
Assuming a boss hits every 2.0 seconds and you are using a 1.3 speed dagger, a boss can hit you three times in a 2.0 second window assuming all of your auto attacks are parried. Using a weapon slower than 2.0 reduces the number of times you can be hit in the same window to twice.
---
Thank you for the info.
---
thats that then. Ill take it down accept the ban and uninstall. everyone is assuming im an asshole but if this shit happened to you then youd understand. I have never had a game ban me for something that doesnt even have to do with the game.
---
I wonder what feral dps would be min/Max if they could have debuff slots for bleeds
---
Idgi
---
You can still see a message that it was blocked in your chat box - how do you COMPLETELY stop seeing them?
---
His wife is his class lead, so he has a shot at upgrading here.
---
It really is stuff like this that makes a server feel like a community. As much as LFG has it's benefits (esp when you're an adult who works full time and aren't a 16 year old who eats sleeps and breathes Kara raids like you used to)  it feels good to recognize people, and see that there is a genuine effort put in by people on the realm because their reputation matters.
---
Except thats not what hes saying. Blizzard have let in MORE players into a server than was ever allowed in vanilla wow. Therefore everythings farmed out. Try reading next time
---
the macro is not for the game tho. Its just a screen capture.
---
The way I see it, loot council works when you have good leaders, and fails hard with bad ones.
---
DKP has a better chance of working for every guild, at the expense of progression cos it's inherently players grabbing gear for themselves.
---
Better be looking for some people that trust you to do that because a lot of the playerbase will laugh at the idea.
---
I had some dungeons but not many. Did Winterspring, started WPL and got 60, then did rest of WPL and EPL + remaining BRS quests for increased gold reward. Few hundred gold from those quests at max level buff. Plus income from instances.
---
DKs just scare people away from quest hubs and the like. It does help but yes, it doesn't do anything to stop a gank out in the open.
---
I'm lucky I haven't experienced that much since I'm the one tanking.
---
Usually a wipe or two acts as a wakeup call and I don't have to say anything
---
Nice to see horde PoV for this! Glad we killed some of them SeemsGood gg
---
Because the exact post youre replying too, which uses loot council, doesnt entrench the core raiders over new comers.
---
"During the raid, we are very hesitant to give gear to these "filler" players because we have no confidence in them or their commitment to the guild. We think it's just as likely that, if they didn't get lucky and grab one of the final raid slots, they would have quit the guild as well."
---
Its like you didnt even read the post before commenting.
---
but its the same thing as me clicking windows+PRNT screen isnt it? if so are screen shots ban worthy? Streamers are literally streaming the game.
---
Sorry, should've used quotes for the word "problem" - i agree that it makes sense and balances out long term, was just clarifying what he was describing because it seemed like you were faulting the DKP system in that case. I'd say that most, if not every dkp system, have this *scenario* play out.
---
You don‚Äôt remember idling in discord back in vanilla, waiting for a mighty officer to verify your dedication?
---
It is making the decision to use the ability or not for you.
---
I don't think you are an asshole, and it is unfortunate you are being punished if you weren't using the software to gain an advantage, but I am someone who has worked in IT for over a decade and has experienced large corporations and small companies in positions ranging from a helpdesk/customer service person like the one you chatted with to administrator and security positions that would be detecting software usage such as this case..... it's hard to sympathize for someone when they frame the post in such an entitled way and furthermore show the way they handled the conversation with the customer service person.
---
streaming is not using automation software.....
---
you violated their terms of service, all you can do at this point is try and get their support number to explain you did not realize you were doing so and what you were using it for but contacting their support like you have done while ignoring what you did and focusing only on the bot part isn't a good look for your case.
---
As a 2hand fury warrior you want  
---
\- QSR
---
\- onslaught
---
\- ony neck
---
\- BRE
---
\- maybe trueflight
---
\- accuria if you want BRE, because 9% hit dont come out of nowhere and you dont get +swords like from OEB
---
\- strikers mark/ blastershot
---
If another warrior is collecting all these pieces, he will start to severly outparse OP, therefore the right decision of the raidlead would be to bench OP and find a new warrior who starts to gear in the raid.
---
The problem wasn't the COD for 100g in this picture, it was that the Righteous Orbs were swapped out for an identical icon "Small Lustrous Pearl" so people would not realise they're not the item they actually asked for, for the few people that accept CODs quickly and don't fully check they'd be accepting a few items worth nearly nothing for 100g.
---
Same way as in retail, the button is on character select.
---
Have you consulted with your [wife's boyfriend](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dcfqgi/my_wifes_boyfriend_just_bought_me_the_gold_for_my/) what he thinks about this? For your sake, it could be a way to play more where [your wife's son](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dkpwqy/how_can_i_progress_when_my_wifes_son_only_lets_me/) won't have control over your play time.
---
Burnt out on leveling a Paladin and most of my friends have quit playing. What‚Äôs a class that‚Äôs fun to level? End game isn‚Äôt important to me.
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat, 40 warrior, 28 shaman, 29 rogue and now working on a paladin like I first planned
---
Legit reminds me of the monster in the remake of The Thing at the end with the human face
---
Play it however you have fun, maybe you never hit 60 but if you enjoy it and have fun who cares?
---
There's too much focus on getting to 60 and getting BiS right now for my liking, people pushing others into doing it when in reality you can chill and take your time and if you aren't the kind of person wanting to be in a progression guild anyway and are having fun then that's great.
---
Because i didnt realize that is what banned me. Also getting denied tickets multiple times was really irritating.
---
&gt; mark of the chosen is only active ~5% or less of the time
---
I'm curious where you get that information from.   From my anecdotal experience I feel like that buff is up 100% of the time when tanking, but I can't say I've bothered to log and check.
---
Because That is a thing macros can check for.
---
We aren't disagreeing with how simple it is in a peogramming sense. It isnt complicated. But it is not allowed.
---
We actually don't have enough information from the example. It could very well be that the mage was misinformed or lying or just saying whatever because he was salty. 
---
The point is that you are misinforming OP if you're telling him that he think about BiS when he's part of a game where BiS actually plays an important role.
---
You are annoying
---
Yea, farming Mara isn't forming a core raiding group. Farming actual high level dungeons might, though.
---
As someone that generally LOVES to pvp while questing, is Fire Mage worth rolling? Been having a lot of fun with Shadow Priest and I don't wanna play frost like everyone else
---
Hunters are very fun past level 10
---
addons=!macros
---
So all the macros which are checking whether you are in stealth or not are like botting? What are you talking about?
---
Lmfao this has me dead
---
Again you seem to be completely missing the point.
---
Nobody said it was hard to maintain hit cap or that LH is anywhere near essential in doing so.
---
There's a clue at the end ;)
---
Again you are ignoring the issue and being obtuse.
---
You now know why you were banned but you keep just talking about all you did was record a clip.
---
You used automation software.
---
You broke their ToS.
---
It's on you to understand their ToS and if you play any kind of MMO you probably should already know to avoid anything that may possibly be detected as violating that.
---
Yes it sucks that you were banned and in your eyes you did not realize you may be banned for it but stop being a dumbass and acting like all you were banned for was clips.
---
You are acting like a dude caught with an illegal firearm who then says yeah but I only use it to scare off pigeons.
---
I'm playing a shaman and planning on alternativing between pvp builds (31/20/0 or 30/0/21), and full resto for raids and dungeons. 
---
If I train 2h axes and maces with the talent with my pvp specs, do i lose skill when I respec out of it? I don't want to retrain my axe skill from 0-300 every time I respec.
---
You make a great point.   It is fun.  And I think both in classic and retail, the heavy push for raiding kinda makes me doubt my own progression.  I really just wanna enjoy it.  And pvp.
---
Omg thank you
---
https://youtu.be/yAmXZPuS7L0
---
I don't a screen capture would cause a ban because it doesn't effect gameplay. 
---
Try: [Appealing a Silence, Suspension, or Ban](https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/166944)
---
Can you elaborate on the macros?
---
I really dont know what else i was banned for then. M5 is screenshot and M1 makes a 30 sec clip
---
I‚Äôve done it, it‚Äôs not one of the better options, you certainly won‚Äôt be doing them underleveled like you can with a warrior or a bear in a good group.  But most pugs before 60 tend to slightly or greatly overlevel the dungeons and a shammy can do great in that context.  More than enough to keep mobs off the healer, which is all a warrior in a pug can manage sometimes anyway.
---
Doing more dps helps the party's success. Things die faster = you have to heal less. Just because you are so terrible you can't heal a dps warrior for a few seconds at most (probably wont even have to heal him tbh) before the tank taunts it back when he occasionally pulls aggro, does not mean the warrior is selfish.
---
And btw, i tank almost every dungeon I do, so i know how it works. I expect dps to go hard. As long as they give me a few seconds to establish threat, its never an issue. I have taunt, i have mocking blow, i have challenging shout.
---
A shaman tanked LBRS with me the other day.  It‚Äôs a thing.
---
Play what you enjoy, but if what you enjoy is performing the best. I'd say Humans for their sword skill are superior in PvE, and Dwarfs for PvP becuase of stoneform. You can remove bleeds, poisons, and other effects. Making it possible to restealth, and also you gain 10% armor which is not much but its something!
---
I have so many nice trinkets already but I need to upgrade my pants and glove, so it looks like I'm going to run brs after all. Thanks dude
---
I hate the responsibility of tanking and healing in classic, I feel like i'd personally be bad at it.
---
If you‚Äôre not doing golem lord, I hope you have a generous guild healer because those guys drop almost nothing for healers and you don‚Äôt clear enough trash to make it better exp than even solo deep holy priest questing.
---
Im not aloud to appeal it... thats part of why im aggravated
---
I mean, it‚Äôs the coolest lookin tank weapon, but idk about best. Certainly not worth spending 1000 gold on.
---
My buddy and I did one of those on Faerlina where there's thousands of people LFG, and it was profitable as fuck. We had 4 orb drops, Truefaith pattern, and 2 blue BoEs (tank pre-bis neck and some gloves I forget, \~180g total value).
---
It's amazing if you can get it going, but I think the time frame of that happening is long past, most people that want pre-bis enough to join a group like that already have it.
---
Sheep healers 
---
kite 2 elites
---
kill 1 elite
---
kill the healers 1 at a time
---
kill the last 3 elites one at a time
---
Man that Resist into Evade was rough to see.
---
The hypocrisy in this thread is palpable. "Your guildies are selfish for not getting YOU geared" LOL
---
Karma bit you right in the ass LOL
---
Ironic, most of the people involved in that whole thing were living under their mom's house
---
I've never actually played a mage so I might be wrong here but you seem far from bad at PvP. Plenty of clutch moments in there he must be pissed!
---
typical horde, ganks you with aggro and then loses lol
---
You seem to think it is so simple. Go Frankenstein a new add on together from the stealth and swing timer add ons and get back to us.
---
Still i don't get it why Blizzard can't patch to random spam channel invite message. Isn't WoW paid account based service?
---
Probably the same people who had to take out a 30g loan at level 44 so they can finally get their mount.
---
Does he use slice and dice?
---
TIL "Guild" means running low level shit because people are lazy and/or selfish.
---
I‚Äôm interested to hear more of your advice. What bosses do you think we should take down in addition to anger?
---
I wouldn't go as far tp say that it isn't worth. Because it's extremely easy for a good DPS to catch up in threat vs a deep prot.
---
The end result is that your DPS don't get to go as hard as they could, so boss dies later, and so healers have a greater chance to run oom.
---
It's ultimately more fun for everyone involved that the tank goes fury prot. But if your raid cannot support it, whether by heals or damage, then you shpuld go deep prot.
---
Gotta pass those meters, yo!
---
Seriously, I'm so glad when my Druid gets a chance to use hurricane on an AoE pack. That's right, baby, a feral topping those charts!
---
...then it's back to middle-of-the-pack for the rest of the dungeon.
---
Yeah man I had 3 arcane crystals in one DME run! Two of them were from the same node!! Does anyone know the chance of recovering one per hit?
---
I feel like you aren‚Äôt really getting the premise here
---
What‚Äôs a more complicated ‚Äúoh shit‚Äù process:
---
1) Realizing you pulled 2 mobs
---
2) Frost armor/Nova
---
3) Run in a different direction
---
4) turn around and frost bolt
---
5) when mobs get close, repeat
---
**or**
---
1) realize you pulled 2 mobs
---
2) divine shield
---
3) continue AAing as you do
---
4) heal if health low (applies at all times)
---
We aren‚Äôt talking about someone who‚Äôs new to wow, we‚Äôre talking about someone who potentially may be new to video games. They‚Äôre going from shuffleboard to WoW.
---
Insanely lucky üòÇüòÇüëç
---
That suck but keep some perspective. It is only a game.
---
It's true until a certain threshold.
---
There comes a point where fury prots out TPS ferals.
---
The reason people are questioning you is because what you say makes no sense.  Mage pulls for you, you start combat with 0 rage, hard to get threat on anything.  Mage doesnt pull for you, you get rage from being hit, can throw out abilites to establish agro. Mage gets to pew pew a couple seconds later.
---
 a tanks is to control mobs threat and have everything hitting you so it isn't hitting your party(among many other things).  A mage pulling before you makes that very difficult and you won't convince anyone here otherwise.  It is not my job as a tank to put up with a mage that doesn't want to paly nice.  If he wants to do that, he can go make a friend and run with that person that doesn't mind him playing like a dickhead.
---
There‚Äôs a set note built in when U right click any name on ur friends list
---
I got a couple horde toons to 30 and 42 respectively, then realized I liked alliance better, and wanted to get off my low-pop server...so now I'm starting fresh again. But playing the other faction, and on a high-pop, is basically a new experience. 
---
The only thing I'd caution is that phase 2 will be out by year's end, and the thinking is that this will make leveling a lot more tedious, with more people out in the world trying to gank for honor points. So if may be worth pushing a toon to 60 before then, just so you have a character to do other stuff on if/when leveling zones are getting camped. 
---
But overall, there's no bad way to play as long as you're having fun.
---
Wish i didnt waste 210 hours on it.
---
What? How did you read my comment, get that out of it, and not realize I was being sarcastic? You alright?
---
hax :) The top one is the 'left' text, the lower one is the 'right' text ... then you set their anchors to be 'inside center left' and 'inside top left' and apply a little x/y offset to line them up.
---
Elemental?  At least magma and fire nova totem, earthbind, lightning bolt, chain lightning, flame shock, 2 ranks of earth shock, frost shock, purge, lesser healing wave minimum
---
That was amazing.
---
There may be better options for all three of their roles but it's not like they are useless. Unless you are in a real min/max type guild you'll be fine and against the average pug group (or average casual type guild) if you learn how to play well and use consumes and the like you will be fine doing any role. Vanilla raids in general being 40 mans too means even if you don't learn how to play but are just a nice person you'll still find spots in a lot of guilds.
---
DM E is the best you can do (by far) if you have all professions needed (herb/enchanting/mining)
---
I was a druid in vanilla and loved It. Got to raid as resto and got all my gear before anyone else. Then went feral resto for pvp and can pretty much kill anyone one v one.
---
You don't need a macro to cancel IB. Just hit the button it's set to again and it'll automatically cancel.
---
Man that's crazy, i literally havent gotten a single one since launch, and i play a fair amount on a high pop server (EU-Mograine)
---
Just curious, but why would you want to do this?
---
3 things... 1) they are very good at being annoying in pvp , most pvp premades will have a druid or druids.  They are PITAs to deal with.  2) They are not *that* un-optimal.  Some steamers said they were and off to the races people went.  3)  Druid gear drops and no druids (most pugs on my server want druids)...tie that in with #2.
---
Or just high af

Yeah I‚Äôll take that to heart, guy who‚Äôs end game is Dire Maul.

I'll take 2 of whatever this guy had, please.

Glad you commented this because it was the only thing that I could think about looking at the pic.

Their fault for not tagging it before starting the tame, and for not getting the tame on their first try. 
---
Just go for it.

You‚Äôre an idiot.

Nice! ... I also have bars on the right like that ... they're just set to hide until mouse-over.
---
Retail makes most (way more too) money by microtransactions. Each toy/mount gives them like 3m+ sales on average
---
So if you are seeing tanks reserve the first orb... generally the etiquette is that you need roll it, everyone else passes or maybe greed rolls it.
---
Then you pass on further orbs. Anyone that wins a subsequent orb will pass on orbs later on that drops.
---
So basically you are guaranteed an orb drop which 'pays' for your tanking. 
---
At least that's the etiquette on my server... no need to master loot, people will behave, if they don't they'll get ostracized for sure.
---
Saw an undead female that reminded me of my ex... Cold, emotionless,  dead inside and out

I moved my raid frames to the bottom left of my screen to remove screen clutter in 40mans and every time im raiding i have to move the chat up manually. Its nothing too big but making this automated would be neat
---
That's a dumb argument.
---
it insane.  theres no internal cooldown.  I've had 200 stats + crusader + 25% haste all active at once on more than one occasion.
---
To each their own. I wanted to start playing my raid spec to get used to the rotation and to avoid the cost of the respec later on and found no difficulty tanking as fury/arms.
---
Nothing bad about it.  People play differently.
---
If you're not comfortable with 9+ keybinds, you don't have to use them, but objectively, you're handicapping yourself.

I tell new players just force yourself to do it and it will become easier than clicking before you know it.

You take one to raids so he can buff everyone. Druids are decent as Offtanks, but pretty bad Healers or DPS.

I'm a Fury/Prot Warrior and my friend is a Resto Shaman, we smoke DM E drop runs, and it's insane gold and super easy. We're mostly raid geared, it might be a little tight duoing it at your gear level but it should be doable. You have the right comp for it, if you have the professions to match it's by far your best option.

Hes in a demo pvp spec so gets fel dom to summon a second VW for a second sac

Druids can do everything, just not as well as other classes. That being said, a good bear has better threat generation than a warrior and more sustainable threat than a paladin. With innervate, brez, quick hots, and solid buffs, it's good to have them in anything you're doing.
---
No kidding??? 3% that‚Äôs absolutely nuts then!

‚ÄúShaman tank isn‚Äôt real and can‚Äôt hurt you‚Äù

Shaman tank:
---
Can confirm.  Except for the returning the money part.  And paying the 30 copper to send a reply.
---
Well done. Loved that bit at the end where you are spamming the blink bottom as it cools Down
---
Ohhh ok. I just thought they were the same. In the manner everything is bought with in game gold and that there was an option to buy gold with irl money
---
Considering you can get another leatherworker to make anything you want to wear, yes.
---
There's a reason (well many reasons) 40 man raiding only lasted until TBC. And the majority of people at the time certanly didn't mind the change to 25. In that big a raid there's always gonna be cliques forming. Add in a loot council system and drama is all but guaranteed.  Guilds are fine with getting people now cause the game is still in the shiny new stage and MC is faceroll. By the time Naxx rolls around its gonna end up like vanilla where very few guilds will be still be raiding.
---
&gt; I'm just the guy tossing strength/windfury totems for ya'll and having fun crushing my mace in someone's face :(
---
I just started healing on my shaman.  I respec'd to elemental at 40.  But this is basically my healing experience so far in 5 mans.  Drop strength and windfury, smash my staff into a mob's face, sometimes stop to toss out a heal.  I feel like I came full circle.
---
Nothing on a weapon procs for a druid.
---
Leather master, I say I am going into battle! And I have need of your strongest leather!

I was able to no-life this game when I was a janky kid in highschool. At this point in my life, I don't want to block off a four hour period to play videogames. If I want to stop playing, I'm going to stop playing. I don't want 39 people getting upset when I want to leave raid because I'm not having a good time anymore. 
---
I hit 60, did some BIS gearing then cancelled my subscription. I've never found the raid experience to be appealing and at this point there isn't much else for me to work towards.
---
Been awhile but try /hb
---
i dont know, its kinda of the beauty of having a hybrid spec
---
big rip needed more patience was losing it after a couple hours lol
---
Why are you ignoring the second thread ?
---
Well that's part of the reason he couldn't afford the projects and now they're bankrupt, they clearly have no idea how to budget.
---
It‚Äôs not that retail is completely worthless, but the inflation rate on gold is much, much higher. 3 gold on classic will net me about the same as 10k on retail.
---
You can spend X amount of money to buy a token and sell it for gold. The buyer of the token can redeem it for game time or X/4 Blizzard balance
---
Ich liebe Dich!

Probably BRD arena runs
---
Short answer: depends on your server economy
---
Learning from Dire Maul, all the obvious stuff actually won't increase when phase 2 releases, because everyone knows about it and will be sitting on enormous stockpiles that they'll be looking to unload. On my server, everything which was 'supposed' to go up when DM came out actually went down on patch day. 
---
From that experience the time to sell would be the period between the phase 2 announcement and the actual phase 2 release, when speculation is driving up prices and people are trying to build stockpiles under the bad assumption prices will continue to rise at release.
---
Yeah- it's always the way we exited. Back down the tower and off the wall.
---
31 holy 20 ret
---
Full judgement
---
Win
---
What more is there to say?
---
90% of the tanks I‚Äôve grouped with have been fury/arms wars that are just tanking to find a group to get their pre raid bis. Prot just isn‚Äôt necessary if you halfway know what you‚Äôre doing as a tank (except 40 man). If the guy wants to be fury long term, no point in adding an unnecessary respec.
---
Dude... That was nice! big props!
---
1st 2nd and 3rd which sucks because you cant even loot it after the first.
---
Are you using a Hard Drive or Solid State?
---
Protip for anyone struggling finding a spot.  Get DMT and Songflower before raid invites, log, then when raid invites start going out whisper your officer you have world buffs and want to go.
---
Well? Why don't you?
---
My guild has an enhance shaman in our raid team and does pretty well. Anyone trying to force you into one roll like vanilla sucks
---
try your guild and server discords.
---
Actually tried doing it once and realized i threw my key away thinking I don't need it being rogue and all &gt;.&gt; I heard coffers are really rng so could be something exciting to add to this boring grind. If you do it let me know how it goes!
---
Priest.
---
Open world: wand spec talent makes most of your damage come from sanding and a DOT (shadow word pain). Power word shield and inner fire make it easy to take little to no damage fighting a mob 1v1. At level 41 you can spec into shadowform and MELT anything.
---
5 man: the best healer in the game or a serviceable dps. No matter what talents you pick priest is capable of healing 5 man content better than any other class. Generally you will use at most 5 different spells (heal, greater heal, Power word shield, renew, fade) with only heal and renew being used 90%of the time. For DPS a shadow priest isn‚Äôt great but it‚Äôs an option, only single target and die to mana and threat issues wand and shadow word pain will be most of the damage. (Healing is a great way to improve because you stand back and watch other people make mistakes and can see exactly what they did wrong compared to everyone else)
---
RAIDS: super overwhelming. BUT, horde side priests are in high demand and it will be easy to get a raid spot. No one is going to yell at an underperforming priest if they are actually trying they will likely just assign them a specific job (focus on dispelling, keep renew on tanks and locks). Spriest are useful in raids but mostly as an off healer who buffs the warlocks. Not a simple raid class but it can be simple if the RL is proactive and accommodating.
---
TLDR: priests are good and simple in the open world, great and simple in dungeons, and overwhelming in Raids but an easy raid spot.
---
If you say so :)
---
I ran it once when Mara was at level.. after I hit 60 and got some gear figured I‚Äôd go back to get the ring finally. Got all assed up with some guildies to farm... dropped first run at 60.. so two runs total =)
---
Edit:typo
---
Its probably the most useless thing people say. classes have 1 good spell for a reason.
---
So I did originally participate in the HWL grind in OG and got to rank 11.  Factually speaking if you want to be as competitive as possible and get ranked then Hillsbrad is the place.  It has the closest spawn graveyards, the most people, and is easily accessible to the highest population.  The trick to farming honor is time investment, and kill involvement.  Healers get Honor for killing targets that are involved with x amount of players in pvp.  While many people think raid grouping is the best, and it is okay, actually having small groups picking off high level targets is the best.  Having a 5 man group who is killing a decent amount and doing a lot of damage is often better than being in a 40 man raid.  
---
I did participate in 40 man raids in TM vs SS all the way to rank 8 before I went with smaller groups.  In a raid group you will get something like 5-15 Honor per kill, and solo you can get upwards to 200-500 for low ranks and Rank 14s for a pure solo kill give about 850, with diminishing returns.  I would not worry about dishonorable kills, they are few and far between and generally your raid will never push that far into the town to get them.
---
Not bad at all little one. :)
