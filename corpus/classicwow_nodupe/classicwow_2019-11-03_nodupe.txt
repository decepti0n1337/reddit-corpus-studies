Conflating playing wow with actual military service feels like stolen valor in itself lol
---
---
---
I always have a bag full of bandages so whenever I lifetap between pulls, I bandage myself to full straight away.
---
lmao
---
Normally you have a holy priest get shadow weaving so you don't lose much dps
---
‘97 and before are accepted. Maybe a test for people after if they want to join lol
---
Wow died for me when MoP was announced.  Panderan were explicitly said not to be considered a race and a single kids movie changed Blizzard's mind.  That and the gutting of the talent trees was not something I wanted any part of..
---

---
I could go back to retail but the more I read about it, the less interested I am.  Pet battles?  Lfr?  Garrisons?  No thanks.  I don't want to feel like I have to do 30 things this week or I'll fall behind.  Wrath burned me out on end game dailies.  Can only do X many, so I have to figure out which rep I want.  Not a fun time for me.
---
Classic is the game I started on and the game I want to play.  No bullshit, no padding, just me, my character, and the world trying to kill me.  TBC fans don't seem to understand that I would be happy playing classic for 10 years, grinding up my characters, gearing and pvping my heart out.   Hell, I'm looking forward to my 2 year old son joining me in classic one day.
---
You can press tab to switch targets?!?! oh shit i had no idea, that is so nice. can you think i any other little things like that i should know?
---
everybody did.
---
I'm looking at the tooltip right now on my 60 warr. Says "Heavy Runecloth Bandage - Requires First Aid (225)"
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=14530/heavy-runecloth-bandage
---
Just like that.
---
This all makes sense now, you’re just an idiot.
---
I wasn’t accusing you of trying to hurt my feelings,  I was asking if that was your intention because you had just said the most fucking moronic, childish response I’ve seen on Reddit this weekend.
---
Well it's spoken now.... Good job
---
I've also speculated this, and would take it even further to say they'll give us ZG/AB slightly before Phase 4/Green Dragons.
---
What's great about these speculations is that it creates an even more accurate reflection of vanilla patches. DM was patch 1.3 while Honor was 1.4(Phase 2) and WSG/AV was 1.5 while BWL was 1.6(Phase 3) and ZG/AB was 1,7 while Green dragons was 1.8(Phase 4). I don't think we'll get anything between AQ and Naxx however since 1.10 was loot revamp and we already have that. All and all, I think that it would make our experience even better too.
---
literally anything relating to druid is a meme
---
I think they tried to mitigate that by having the new capital as neutral. But yeah, it got to the point where the old “new” capital city became almost entirely pointless.
---
The key to Classic+ is adding new content without effectively killing the older content besides as a fill gap for hitting max level and moving on.
---
2 people were doing that for days on Sulfuras. So fucking annoying.
---
Hm. You've been playing with some terrible shadow priests, because shadow priests can do some pretty damn good damage if they wanna blow their mana in dungeons and drink a lot. So, idk if your comment about the spec being impossible bares any weight.
---
Of course, with AoE it's a bit of a struggle, but they can throw out SW:P on the mobs and then single target from there.
---
Thank you for the info, if that is the case then yes this video is amazing! :D
---
Very few hunters will ever get Ashjre'thul, and their damage is lower (especially in MC) now that Lupos doesn't do shadow damage. They're still miles better than shamans, priests, druids, etc.
---
I'm in the same boat. Was excited to play classic after playing vanilla through to TBC release. I don't own BFA right now but yesterday I rolled a new character on retail and am having a blast. 
---
Maybe that'll go away eventually and I'll want to play classic again. Who knows.
---
No doubt in my mind they'll release BGs early, it's going to be a nightmare when P2 starts, every flight path will be camped by raids of people farming honor, screencap this post, they'll release BGs within 2 weeks of floods of complaints.
---
I’m just waiting for the $50 ‘Bring your classic character to retail’ transfer service announcement before the new expansion releases.
---
Forever mirin
---
I mean, it will be exactly as it was back then...for better or worse
---
Right, but evidently the first time he's being reported to Blizzard since the launch of classic.
---
Not gonna even read this wall of text. Lvl 50 go do mauradon then BRD, LBRS, UBRS, scholo, and strat til you hit 60. Don’t deal with world pvp and also get your prebis. You’re welcome
---
I get some of that, but getting mad about being camped is silly to me. One, it is a game. Two, it's allowed therefore intended gameplay. Three, it's someone else's fun to do it. Maybe I have a fucked sense here becuase I played Eve online for 12 years. There is no loss in wow, no real loss anyway, what is there to honestly get upset about? Interaction that caused you to have to take res sickness and go somewhere else? Lastly, just because someone is a camper at some point does not mean that is all they do in the game to have fun. They may be doing it as vengeance because they were camped and its fun for awhile to get one back on the other side.
---
Stay on skull to start, build a few combo points. When skull is at half health or less, apply a bleed and then switch to X. By then the tank should have had a chance to build aggro, and you aren't coming in strong with a bunch of backstabs or SS in a big burst. It's fine to be smart with combo points, but rogues who just go ham on X straight away aren't helping the group.
---
&gt; Druids are bad at every role  
---
  
---
This rings so true as a balance druid
---
I would be more embarrassed to share this rather than humble-bragging about it.
---
I was appointed that position with another pally to do just this in the early days of MC.
---
Don't start none, won't be none
---
AB would be the ideal first BG they release early to offset the release of honor on unbalanced servers. It was always the most fun to play of the 3. WSG was very prone to momentum swings and AV could be over in 10 minutes or 2 hours depending on whether you wound up in a pre-made or a full pug.
---
i would be down for this! Yet it takes away from *the classic experience* as being butt ganked adds to it NOChanges /s
---
&gt; If anything, classic has opened my eyes that it may be time to hang up the KB and mouse
---
I'm in the same spot. Wife, kids, job, life outside of the game. I'll go months without playing anything at all, then come back to the PC and fire something up. Right now it's WoW.
---
I don't think I'll ever hang my KB/mouse up for good, but they certainly won't ever see as much love as they used to.
---
Same, I do exactly the same thing.
---
They did this eventually in retail
---
Dude it’s a song. Google it
---
That’s very disheartening to hear. Where are all these bad locks coming from? They give us good ones a bad name
---
Side note: I leave lowbies alone unless they attack first, are in one of the few KOS guilds, or attack a fellow Horde lowbie right in front of me after staring at me for 30 seconds like this really, really smart 55 Paladin did yesterday.  
---
Also, it just about ALWAYS seems to be the hunters that love to contemplate fucking with me, fuck with me, die, and either continue to fuck with me and die or try to 2v1 and still die. Hunters, why u do dis?
---
Layering dungeons to farm last boss loot was OP, and resulted in bans.  So the 5 day rag kill was literally because of exploiting.
---
You know you don't have to use twitch to download their app and have the app update your addons for free, right?  It's a free service and all you need is a little icon that says twitch on your computer.
---
Still ugly.
---
depends on the combo though, I've played shadow priest + UA lock in those seasons when warrior + resto druid were the flavor of the month, and I've fucking loved them - since about 90% of them were basically free points. didn't help matters much that most druids (even those who made it to gladiator) were just *astonishingly terrible*. ah, fun times.
---
Yikes are people really struggling with boss strategies in Classic??
---
WoW was never a hardcore RPG, but Retail has become a full blown action game, in its drive to make everything streamlined and esports-friendly.
---
LET DRUIDS TANK!
---
Grats man.  Got my Perdition's Blade last night too on our guilds first Rag kill.
---
Lol
---
This is probably someone frantically farming.
---
I’m on a PACKED server and none of the popular farming spots for oily or stranglekelp are very populated with farmers.
---
Yes. It is fine to be slow on a PVP server. Your goal is to enjoy leveling as efficiently and painlessly as possible, while waiting for BGs to drop. Those are your end game. If you’re smart about your class choice, craftable and grindable gear, and honor and rep gear, you’ll be able to keep up with raiders until T3 drops.
---
So he cleared MC once and managed to get every good item from MC in that one run?
---
I mean they are basically NPCs on pve servers.  Zero interaction, cant even stop them from taking a node from you.  Eww.
---
I still enjoy how many people fall for the /e spits on you.
---
You are a hero!
---
It's utterly ridiculous to suggest there is barely a difference in gameplay between pve and pvp.  You are deluding yourself.
---
If the opposite faction is trying to camp BRM then go try to quest. It’s just the way it is. I’m sure they’ll release BGs earlier than p3 because of all the QQ though
---
It really makes you think though. Is it isolation that does it or is it the type of person attracted to the culture of these types of games? 
---
It'll make a nice capstone project for a sociology major in 15 years when there's enough data to work with
---
Spy addon
---
Definitely not. It'd be a waste of your money anyway. Move the too again by paying or jist make a new one.
---
So you aren't done with the current patch's content unless you have every BiS item? You must really hate titanforging lol. 
---
If youve completed all the content and you just login to farm gold and items for the next tier, you are ready for the next tier. It's not like you stop running MC
---
The very first dusty tome I found was empty. So I don't think it's because of "unique" items. I think it's intended.
---
Who was surprised by that? Every lore place I was in knew about the Forsaken plague. The discussions were mostly Horde players gaslighting everyone and themselves into believing the Horde are still the good guys because with Putricide's betrayal, Sylvanas was actually *totally innocent*, you see.
---
yeah they are. i'm SM/Ruin raid spec with a few pieces of necro/t1 for pvp. so dece pvp gear but not amazing. And yet I see the same people time and time again try to kill me mid-devilsaur fight and time and time again they get pooped on lol
---
Its likely just the challenge attracts those who are already toxic and because its competitive it fosters toxicity.
---
Yeah that's not the same at all as a pvp server.  It's not about the pvp, it's about the risk and added player agency.
---
Your audio choices really make this, nice work.
---
That's a boomer level use of that format.
---
No systematic racism is underground in america when the laws and views by society at large enable it.   
---
Just because people don't talk about things makes it underground. Underground would have to be hidden from plain view. That's literally not the case when there is a news story about a white cop killing a black person in cold blood every fucking couple of months like clock work and then they get off on technicalities or because the jury sympathized with them.   
---
There is nothing underground about that; America was literally built upon racism it's ingrained in everything.   
---
Shit off the top of my head the biggest reason why a lot of states require lawyers to go to law school and pass a bar exam  is because black people after the civil war started to be able to actually represent themselves / others and the easiest way to keep them from doing that ways by requiring a test which proved to be not enough then they added law school as a requirement. 
---
\&gt; creates new account and it becomes known he's bypassed the perma ban  
---
\&gt; Representative now drags blizzard in front of congress to tell them how they're such a large company but does jack shit to prevent online radicalization.   
---
Seems like blizzard has a lot more riding on making sure the dude can't get back in any publicly known way vs letting him create a new account. (Which unless he goes to great lengths to hide his identity while making a new one odds are they'll catch it again because there's so much metadata they can use to figure out it's him)   
---
Both twitter and facebook are constantly faced with these criticisms and take strides in ensuring that their platform doesn't become a tool for more destruction. 
---
There is absolutely no fucking reason why a game company that has the largest fucking social game in existence from experiencing and doing the same steps to prevent it.   
---
But like hey once again i have to point out that by shutting down any form of propaganda that can be spread in video games it is helping curb racism. Propaganda through video games is literally a well known vector for radicalization and by not actively pursing ways to stop it from spreading on their platforms these companies are complicit in radicalization.

So in short you can't quote it.  It's all in the thread- I've changed nothing.  And after all your bluster.  And again you are projecting.
---
I think you shouldn't call people out with nothing to back it up.
---
Pathetic.
---
I feel attacked
---
I like to mark targets as a rogue when I play with friends. I feel like it's a good fit, healer and tanks got other shit to deal with but a single target DPS and interrupt machine is well placed to lead the way on single target destruction.

I mean, what else is she having her apothecaries develop a plague for? So they can level up their alchemy?

He became a pretty popular bodybuilder. Did a lot of steroids. I think he had a congenital heart issue. Died when he was in a sauna in Thailand (some speculated he was doing a lot of drugs in Thailand). 
---
I think the idea is if he stayed a WoW nerd he wouldn’t have started taking so many steroids, and thus would still be alive. 
---
RIP ZYZZ 😢
---
Bro... I fucking love this shit. Thanks for all your hard work!
---
And those blue dragons that all the hunters are farming.
---
For leveling it’s even worse, it’s very rare in world PvP that people fight on an equal footing. It’s usually one side jumping the other, so the less downtime you have and the less you need to exert yourself to kill mobs, the less vulnerable are to getting jumped. It becomes a deterrent in itself. 20 less energy cost for CS will do nothing when you get jumped at 30%.
---
😂 now you're projecting, you've finally understood the term and decided to embrace it. Look at your original comment.
---
There most certainly is not and trying to make one just hurts gaming in general. You think the general perception of gamers will improve by referring to the most toxic of us as “Gamers”? You think any media attention they get will go to great pains to seperate the two? That stupid gamer gate bullshit is all the proof you need if you don’t believe me, it cast all gamers in a very poor light.
---
They’re garbage people are are going to be garbage people in every area of their lives. These ones are garbage people playing games.
---
Can someone tell this nonhunter more about what u do here? I've heard bits about this epic quest again n again but never a full background
---
Hunters do this to unlock something ? And it's rather difficult ? And I was told u have to do it mostly solo or fully. No random or outside help.
---
Alright thanks!
---
Her intentions cannot be clear because she's gone through what, 5 different writers at this point? And each of them is making it up as they go along.
---
We are rogues, ignoring the proposed situation is exactly what we do!  Stop arguing with us, we're building up Reddit combo points..
---
Right. So it’s not that fun. And I’m probably crafty enough to get in, but will the rest of my group members be?
---
Either way it’s not a great game experience and people will complain about it.
---
Do you guys honestly feel like this has anything to do with classic? It seems like this would have had to be in the works before all the classic hype.
---
So it’s probably worth it to Just get The enchants that make The biggest diffirence for your character
---
7 less is not equal to better.
---
They’ve screwed everything up-
---
Expect the worst and be happy if it isn’t.
---
Also there is a script to check if you've completed a quest. I would have thought GMs could run it for any character, but they could log in to your character and run it if necessary. A GM logged into my character to fix a phasing bug during Cataclysm.
---
Damn.... somofabitch. I mean he did what he preferred but he also died from it mostly. Thank u for the info man!
---
People with that facial shape have 100% chance of being a douche
---
Alts! From skeram alliance side, the push to release p2 has basically fucked me. I'm lvl 38 as we speak. I work Mon-Fri full time. There is 0 chance I'll be 60 before Nov 12. Most likely, I'll be right at the point a lvl 60 gets honor for killing me. I'll be a free kill to the world that is heavily horde favored.
---
It already is
---
So back to square 1 eh? xD
---
Same reason I got mine. I was playing one day and all of a sudden got d/c'd. I logged in an hour later to see my warriors bags were full of saronite ore that I didn't farm. They liquidated my bank alt, and everything. I attached the authenticator the same day. I called blizzard to fix the issue, and they got back as much stuff as they could. They let me keep the ore though, so that was a little bit of a silver lining. Blizzard was super cool about it. "Yeah, I see you're from Maine. I also see a random login from an IP address in China, and then from Maine again." I miss old school customer support from blizzard, they were super helpful.
---
Getting ganked by a 60 at level 23 has nothing to do with phases, get a grip
---
Level**
---
Words I can't stand anymore (sorted by class in OP's order): "ogog", "oops", "heal?", "chill", "reserved", "anyone need?", "MANA" (that's me), "I'm DPS", \[Alliance, sorry\]
---
Winterspring farming is lucrative and is where you get a large number of raid buffs.  Gadgetzan can suck a fat dick.
---
I leveled destro the whole time to 60. It is funny but I found the best way to mitigate getting his was to send out my VW out, and just wand the mob. Then after second torment I would just spam sbolt until they die. If you crit first bolt you can pull off VW but if you don't you won't get touched.
---
Not saying it is a better spec than affliction but the aoe farming I did was much easier with the hellfore/rof pushback resistance talent. I did level MD/Ruin though so I wasn't full destro.
---
&gt; If you're the kind of player who feels bad outnumbering enemies, ganking an enemy when they're low, or killing someone when they're fighting something minding their own business, then that person has much more to lose on a pvp server than they do to gain.
---
Most players on pvp servers also don't gank greys etc.  This idea that everyone playing on a pvp server is some aggressive asshole is utterly wrong.  In fact this is far more common on pve servers and ex-pve server players playing on pvp, they often want to kill everything in sight because they finally have the freedom to do so after being so restricted before.
---
Actual pvp server players who've always played pvp servers are much more picky about who and when.  They know that killing someone in an area where the corpserun is nearby while questing is generally a bad idea unless done in self defence...etc.  Pve players barely think about these things as they're not relevant on pve servers.
---
&gt; And ironically, there are a whole lot of cowardly players on pvp servers
---
Completely agree, that's why god invented kos list addons ;)  And that in itself is another example of the difference in gameplay between the servers.  What's the point of a KoS addon on a pve server when the likelihood is someone will just not be flagged next time you see them.
---
Lmao
---
The place being Eastern Plaguelands is a nice touch.
---
Seen 3 on my end. 1 in Strat, 2 in Azshara Satyr camps
---
&gt; Sometimes I’ll renew+shield the tank before he pulls
---
Unless your tank is a Paladin (read: isn't fueled by rage)... don't do this. It is not helpful. Tanks are built to take damage. Let them take damage. Just get up and start casting that big heal as he hits threshold (probably with near full mana).
---
Several instance portals are already effectively camped. And entrances.
---
It's not going to change as much as you'd think for dungeons.
---
&gt; knocks off an hour of raid time

Only when bosses hit 20% because of execute but for the most part rogues do too dps.
---
Negative. I am a meat popsicle.
---
What’s really sad is you probably think you’re actively making the world a better place by attempting to police language like this.
---
Honor didn't exist in beta, but otherwise this is true.

You can still use it to aid your movement even when you click health pots, like what’re you even saying.

Double RIP
---
you can only get 13000 rating points per week and you lose 20% every week regardless (reset day). so the higher rank you are, the higher RP you lose each week. that's why takes minimum of 3 months for R14. the ape above me doesn't know what he's taking about.
---
if you are bracket14 every week this is the minimum it will take for R14: [graphic](https://s.put.re/ko8HmSJt.jpeg)
---
No. Guild will kick you.
---
Grid/clique works beautifully for classic btw.
---
I mean, think whatever you want. Don't much matter to me. I don't really spend time corpse camping lower levels just bc it's boring but I've got no moral objection to it. It's a game and world PVP is forever going to be unbalanced. People are either out numbered, got mobs on them, out leveled etc. That's just WoW being WoW.
---
Yea as nice as it seems, once your high level it will be impossible to find groups at certain times.
---
Account 1 and 2.
---
Account 1 you delete your character.
---
Account 2 you make a new character with your old characters name.
---
Account 1 you recover your deleted character (I think you can do this once every 15 days). Since the name is already taken from account 2, you get a rename. 
---
I heard this works but I never did it myself. Someone suggested this when wanting to change names like you. I'm not sure if you even need two separate accounts with subs
---
What does that even mean to “link spells with quests”?
---
Lol because this is classics thread. So if u wanna see how many are on retail and not classic... that's the place to go
---
I picked a PvP server for the wife and I this time, but we’re not 60 yet and our server is surprisingly chill so we’ll see what happens. I warned her when we ran through STV for the first time though.
---
There are plenty of asshole warlocks out there that complain when you don't heal them after they've life tapped /Grumpy asshole priest that hates life tapping warlocks.
---
Lmao you were sitting in LFG for 10 minutes and you’re depressed. Ok
---
Oh ya I still fuck up though. Playing warlock makes me feel not to smart. Maybe it’s just cause I’m not really that smart in the first place.
---
We really should just make everything personal loot. That would be great....................
---
WotLK was the worst though... an addon that literally just told you were to stand to dodge every mechanic...
---
Some people care too much what other people do. Who gives a shit what his UI is, if it works for him.
---
I don't in any way condone this language but you have to admire the sheer effort that guy has gone to in order to be as toxic as possible.
---
I'm not attempting to police language, I'm trying to make it clear that people really do make use of innocuous symbols and language to impart plausible deniability to their rhetoric. Nowhere did I say, 'you are not allowed to say these things'. My meaning was rather 'while certain symbols do indeed have a prior use that is common and completely innocuous, it is for that specific reason that the symbols are coopted by certain politically oriented groups, in order give them an out that they couldn't possibly be using them to signal to other shitty people'.
---
Does that make it clearer for you? I did get the sense from your previous post that your reading comprehension is not that great, so I should have perhaps made my meaning clearer. The fact that you responded with what amounts to more alt-rightish meme content is also quite sad, although not entirely unexpected.
---
Well, judging how there are pandas in one version... I believe this could happen if Activision Blizzard wanted to conjure a storm and activate a bunch more bullshit, especially as a response from the player base.
---
Because everyone sucked in 2005 and bringing six warlocks is not a good move, especially if this was before the debuff limit increase
---
I found him.
---
Imagine giving debuff slots to warlocks.
---
My thoughts exactly

Maybe u want to druid tank? Lol
---
This is clever af lol it's called entrepreneurship. Duh.
---
NANI?!
---
If he stayed a WOW nerd we wouldn’t have gotten the legend that is Zyzz
---
You are weird.
---
Oh yeah, im not farming specifically for it. I am just a hunter doing solo runs for gold. I did have 2 treant's bane drop though.
---
Or we rolled on a PvP server because we enjoy it but didn't think blizzard would rush the phases and thought we had more time to hit 60. Even just getting more than a week's notice would have been nice.
---
Now those of us that haven't hit cap yet will have a substantially harder leveling experience than those that rushed it. If it ends up being as bad as many are predicting, it's only going to drive people away from the game.
---
Got it second run, and got both the mace and the gloves from emp and princess same time first run. Ez
---
Edit: also got animated chain second run. I do pray every night to rngsus

If she were a raid boss, you could only bring her health down to 5% and she'll give you a long winded speech about whatever and then eff the hell out of there.

There is no killing the banshee queen. Not today. Not ever.

Well in a VOIP with 40 people talking isn't always the best option and people like to go AFK at times so being able to just check is nice.
---
I personally don't use it because I don't give a fuck how you're speced if we're downing the content.
---
Now this makes sense.  I never said he shouldn't acknowledge it.  I did saying he should look at his own house (state) and the level of racism shown there before throwing those stones blizzards way.  He is in no position to be telling other people to clean up their act with such a fragile position.  I though the quote was fairly clear but maybe it's a language thing
---
Almost got to 50 but lost motivation to log in and play. It sucks because I do want to get to 60 and I feel like I'm abandoning friends. I guess it's burnout? Any tips on how to deal with that?
---
I think I've put so much pressure on myself and spent every minute of free time on classic but it still hasn't been enough to keep up with the crowd. And now I've burnt out but that feels even worse because if I do come back I'll be even further behind. Especially with phase 2 coming soon
---

I’ve heard this, thanks! Hoping someone can verify!

We have 4-5 every raid. I'm actually leveling a paladin to swap mains because so many druids.
---
Just die and run back.  It sucks but if you don’t like it why play on a pvp server?
---
Yes , I forgot there were gold sellers tbh.
---
That’s like saying that The best way to win a fistfight is to shoot your oponent in The head

It didn't have to look so cluttered. [My mage UI in 2006 was pretty clean.](https://i.imgur.com/x440kca.png)
---
No, your eyes don't deceive you. That is indeed a mage casting fireball in MC. In my defence, our main raid was AQ by that point and fire was better for BGs.
---
No one claimed they were entitled to a group, they said the mentally of modern players in games sucks because it's less about the adventure/enjoying the game and more about reading a step by step guide on how to min-max and trying to compete over nothing.
---
Well DBM does basically the same by now. One of the reasons I stopped playing. DBM told me fucking everything and it was so boring.
---
You basically just get the group to agree that if a certain item drops, you get it, without needing to roll. Usually its for important items in raids or if you perform a certain roll in a group--ex. tanks often can res the first orb in strat live, mostly due to how much casters need to run it vs how little incentive there is for a tank otherwise.
---
I just click on protect and then it works ?
---
I'm his chestbrah
---
I'm keeping mine for mooncloth bags
---
Are you serious lol, I'm lvl 43 and I've put a fair amount of my free time into the game. Being serious about the game and having time to speed to 60 aren't mutually exclusive. I could be level 20 and still be passionately serious about the game. Gotta work with the time you have.
---
&gt;My point is click just above the action bar to mouse turn?
---
So you're saying that you click the health pot *then* turn? 
---
I misinterpreted. 
---
I thought that you meant that you could use your mouse to aid your turns while clicking your health pot. 
---
Basically, you're saying 'just click the pot really fast then have your mouse go back to turning for you.'
---
&gt;If you can’t move your mouse from the far left to atleast 1/4 to the middle of the screen then idk how u mouse aim at all even.
---
I mean, if you have such awesome precision that you can snap perfectly to the button and click it with a crazy fast reaction, you'd think that you would be good enough to just use a keybind lol.
---
There’s no actual content there releasing... just PvP. Go play another game. This is honestly he worst part of he community....
---
Stop coming here to cry it’s fucking disgusting.
---
Bring it back? It's a common word! At least in the UK, I guess maybe not elsewhere?
---
You don't know how bad it was. Dbm doesn't literally draw a circle on the ground saying "go here", and yes it was that bad.
---
I'd say it's a good community change, as the reason you would be linking the quest is trying to bring in others to know what you are needing or going to do.
---
Can't think of a negative to it.
---
Don’t recall the general consensus being Classic is “hard” but hardER than Retail..
---
I don't think I can make you see reason but warlocks should be tapping since it's the most efficient way to get faster clearspeed.
---
I heard somewhere that poison application is independent of attack speed, applying a flat number of times per minute in classic.
---
I can’t find a source so this may be misinformation —I also cannot test as I don’t play a rogue. Anywho would love to find out
---
He's not perpetuating it at all, because it's going to happen, no matter what he does. I will kill a lowbie if i feel like it at the time, however i certainly won't camp them.

Wrong.

Not true. BoE equipment becomes soulbound as well once equipped.

Yeah but the drawer sticks sometimes, pain in the ass, you know?

---
Imagine being shit enough to not let them curse.
---
I can’t think of a downside for this. Anyone?
---
You're right. Maybe I'm just reluctant to admit that something I enjoy could attract the types of people that I despise. I think my want of another explanation could just be desperation. At the same time I still hope there's something else going on.

Why did you roll on a PvP server and not expect PvP?
---
You are a saint.
---
as a priest i am wondering, how do i get through the doors? i know the rest of the mechanics amd how to kite, but how do i open the doors?
---
If you have nameplates on, camp a node for a while. If it truly is #nochanges you might see underground noclipping bots farming.  Oh god I hope not.
---
good changes imo.  I'm not convinced just yet but if this is the direction they are going i may give retail another chance
---
Man that just sounds so sad...... lmfao
---
It doesn’t work. I tried this a while ago and it says something like “you can’t restore this character because you already have a character with this name”. And it doesn’t work with different accounts either: whenever you delete a character, the server still reserves that name for your account and nobody else can take it in next 90 days. They even explained why they do it: if someone deletes a character and somebody else IMMEDIATELY takes their name, it can potentially let the new owner impersonate the previous owner in order to confuse other people who are not aware of that sudden change. So we have a 90-days rule that prevents it from happening.
---
Yes I googled him.  According to Google there has been a rise of KKK and facist activism in ca in recent years.  Hence my comment really.  Appreciate that this may be in areas outside of his direct control however he is in a position of influence there and irl is the cause of racism in wow, not the other way around.
---
For someone that understood me you certainly seemed keen to call me a liar but nvm.
---
They won’t do it, people could amass huge amounts of gold, transfer servers, buy out the AH and then transfer back making thousands and thousands of gold.
---
If they're your friends they'll help you along when you feel like playing
---
Actually it's the first time ever for me!
---
If you aren't the main tank healer in a raid, you absolutely will be able to get away with a 30/0/21 or any similar variation of mixture that you like on ele/resto hybrid. 
---
And it's generically the route the casters follow for PVP anyway as they want the range bonus from Elemental but Tidal Mastery and Nature's Swiftness from Restoration. 
---
However, all that being said... 
---
Enhancement is also pretty damn good at pvp if you want to be a melee shaman, and can still heal if you put your spill over points into the resto tree and get the gear to heal.
---
lose*
---
qq more noob
---
This also applies to people pulling aggro and running away from the tank.
---
Let me give you an example, gold sellers still send me chat invites for their website. When I disable chat invites i still get a message about who sent me a chat invite, that it was blocked, and what the channel name is for the website. Where is the option to completely hide chat invites? No where to be found because they don't care.
---
Next, there are a ton of bots that still play. Their software might be better but in order to keep their margins as high as possible they utilize less human monitoring and any new type of software will get through the cracks. This will ALWAYS happen. Almost every botting software has been caught? How about the ones that haven't? How would you know what has or has not been caught if you haven't caught it? That's a pretty ridiculous assumption.
---
Lastly, they don't do anything to actively do anything about gold sellers. Do you think they have one person who goes on those sites, tries to buy gold and then ban people who follow through with it? Nope. Why? Because that would hurt their subscriptions. The bottom line for them is that they want to maximize subscriptions. If there are too many people getting mad at botters because they are obviously botting then you lose people. And if you get rid of all of your botters you lose those subscriptions. It's pretty obvious the literal only thing they care about is money instead of the quality of their game. I could go into Blizzard and clean that shit up in one day. They can't do it in 15 years because they don't really have a prerogative to.
---
Yea but it's so close to Org. Gadget is pretty far and it'll be nice to jump down to silithus/un'goro.

You dont even need to do that you walk to the left and get as close to the door as you can into that pillar and /tar jed and if hes there youll get him
---
Wow. I'm on this grind now and it only amplifies how legit this is. You're a God.
---
Yea honestly why would someone want a comment like that being made? Do you run your mouth like that irl? Try it, see what comes from it..
---
Some people in this world just don’t take no shit.
---
The masses will cry on Reddit whether or not I do 😂

Did this yesterday with my friend changed my mages name in classic, does work.

Why so you can see how broken certain classes and specs are?

Hi dad how do I appeal my downvote
---
It’s normally done as a flat fee cause the lock will take all the blues anyways and master loot you the ring while you afk near the entrance.
---
clearly not on a PvP server like Skeram. I get killed outside UBRS 95% of the time. They give no fucks about being worth honor or not.
---
It’s important for the meta for some bgs to come out before av. Av is easily the most honor so if that is out at the same time as wsg there will be no reason for anyone ranking to do wsg which would be a huge shame.
---
For rogues is Hanzo Sword a better offhand than vanquisher's sword? 
---
I have thrash blade for main hand. Hanzo swords are around 25 gold on my server.
---
Thanks bro, that explanation was really helpful.
---
I always toss a renew on a lock after each pull. If I'm going to drink anyway why not? Go ahead pull the next pack I'll be fine so long as the tanks gear isnt super shit.
---
there are two different healbots. Healbot nowdays is basically just a unit frame addon and the clique addon in one addon (i personally use grid tho)
---
but there was a different healbot in classic around that literally had you just press one button
---
you're one lazy guy!
---
Ive seen people post on both reddit and blizz forums about getting banned/suspended for buying gold.
---
I know all the old major botting software got detected because i create botting software and was very interested in the wow ones. Sure there are probably a few slipping through the cracks but it's just a matter of time till they are caught. Then they will update their code and be fine for another year or two, and get caught again.
---
Well that’s more of a game design issue with how they have done specifically with Classic. Players are incentivized to hunt lower level players for honor. It’s the best path to item progression, and it will be done at any time outside of when players are actively in MC or Onyxia  
---
I love PvP servers and I have my own solution to the game design problem which is to just play an alt.
---
haven't done it personally, but i believe you can
---
I was in a 2day long AV recently, it's more the version of AV than the mind set.

Don't kinkshame us !

I have a problem with having so many hotkeys i cant remember them all and just end up clicking 1/4 of my abilities. It is a hard habit to break trying to remember that many buttons

I didn't do a single quest that started and ended in STV, except my armorsmith quests, and the gnomeregan key quest, on either my 60 Warrior or my 54 Warlock.

Just copy it yourself lmao lazy ass
---
Only the Life Drain procs in the OP scale with spelldamage right now. There are a few more that might that release in later phases though.

Just, go find something better to do then wonder why people don’t like you cause you tell people to F off for no good reason. 
---
Here’s your downvote, thanks for playing.

Look at the date, Halloween is over my friend

You are making me feel bad. Right now I'm running 12/22/17 for Dire Maul farm as Hunter.

No doubt Dropped-d is very smart! 20 in intelligence score.
---
Only pvp, not all of p2
---
Its not for everyone, but there are advantages to having 7-14 days off naturally. Makes vacations very easy to schedule.
---
If you are getting on a caster then it's 100% okay and everyone else here is an idiot. You can kick/stun every spell easy peasy and make the group take less damage overall. If you get on that hard hitting sundering mob then you are fucking up for sure.
---
Found the Paladin who heals as Ret in raids.
---
I think that the spelling was intentional so that it would be obvious that the /me was a fake. Don't quote me on that though.
---
Nice I also want to do this. Wolves are boss
---
My point is nobody is worth honor right now. Any PvP is just for lulz.

When Phase 2 hits, a lot of people are going to focus on productive ganking.

How did you reach exalted with darn? Just turning in runecloth?
---
Lol I 100% guarantee you read the initial post and before even thinking about the positives or negatives you instantly wrote your post because classic is the perfect game right? lmfao.

Random thought but your comment made me think of this: I think I could get VERY into a Modern Warcraft with the same races set in the future ala Bright starring Will Smith.

---
Ok I did But I stuffed up the send chat message line. Don't know what I did wrong there
---
They tell you before hand its a one way transfer you can't pick and choose and transfer here there and everywhere because you decided to move from your high pop server. Ticket will do nothing because the small print tells you exactly what I just typed up. So better get leveling again or get used to your new server.
---
Lol imagine caring this much? We clear every week in one night, If we can get it done faster with the buffs why does it matter?
---
Resto sham using stoneskin &amp; healing stream? Lol
---
With a summoning team at Dire Maul and the raid entrance it's about 10-12 minutes of time for the majority (~34 people) of the raid, from popping the Ony buff to being in the raid instance. That's how we did it on K3. Takes a bit of coordination but it's worthwhile.
---
Role another priest for PvP. For real though, if you are only logging to raid, you could level a priest pretty quickly with your main feeding it. Should be able to get level 40 in a few days casually.
---
It actually has a kind of specific meaning 
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_Valor_Act_of_2013
---
No one is going to agree with me when I say this, but screw it: You could clear all content in Classic with nearly all of the players in pre-raid BiS. Only the main tanks of the raid need actual raid gear.
---
The hard part is finding a group to actually take you. It's not so much that your average player \*needs\* a certain level of gear to clear any of the content. It's that they will need to have better gear than someone else in order to get a raid spot.
---
he wouldn't want us to be sad cunts
---
Still a dick move, but i can understand it completely.
---
Same level characters fighting, even camping, is pvp.  ?? v 36 is not.
---
Utility &gt; Beauty
---
Did you ignore everything I wrote? It doesn't matter. The majority of people in any game aren't hardcore, we'll find guilds/people doing shit at a slower pace.
---
I am totally loving classic, I think it is damn near perfect. But BC is actually a more perfect form of the game and I can't wait
---
I would say if your at 100% health you should tap at least once so you can regen health while in combat. I feel its wasted if you stay 100%. Also drain life after a tap or 3 kinda evens out a lot.
---
If I can spot buyers, sellers, and botters on the daily they suck at what they are doing. Bottom line.
---
It was in the early spring of 2005, way way before 1.12
---
Once bliz finds out about these OBVIOUS EXPLOITS they will likely fix them. 
---
They have done multiple times during classic with very similar situations idk why people are getting so mad about this. 
---
You would have to be seriously biased or troubled to think that this isn’t some kind of exploit or glitch bliz didn’t intend for people to be breaking.. 
---
One similar thing is people would find an evade spot in tanaris against the humanoid warlocks and repeatedly kill just the pets witch cause game breaking exp amounts and bliz fixed it ASAP once they found out.
---
You forgot life tap, curse and banish bro!

I literally just now realized you're supposed to dismiss your pet for jumping skips :(
---
Not always true, get ganked a lot by alliance groups on Thunderfury, which is odd since they’re fewer in number.
---
That's because 5g is bad and has zero stability to begin with.  A fart can stop the signal and loose connection
---
I see this kind of thing all the time and the average WoW Classic player is in their 30s or 40s
---
To stall it out to 2 hours, not 3 days.
---
I wish men on grindr talked Classic Wow with me in my city. But nope. Just hookup requests! 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Mmm dunno we both got cc removal based racials in will of the forsaken for ud and escape artist for gnomes.
---
That said gnome tastes the best.
---
But you're implying what a guild accomplished in a video game akin to real life military service lol. Can't see how that's a little much?
---
Not me, fuck sheep, stupid animals bleating their bullshit and always falling from the sky as a frozen mess making it dangerous to drive
---
There are still some stuff that we are rediscovering. Some trash was different on the private servers, bosses too. Overall it's much more easy which is kinda disappointing. Then again it's MC.. it's the first raid in WoW so I guess it should be easy.
---
Doesn’t it give you dishonorable kills if the person is 10 levels lower?
---
&gt;~90% 
---
Source? Or just pulling bullshit stats out of your ass and presenting them as facts?
---
I watched this.. after having played for the full 25 years through all the franchise, this brought a tear to my eye!
---
Why can't I just pop my Mammo--oh fuck
---
That's why that system didn't last through the next expansions?
---
The joke only became a joke through the translation. In German, those 2 sentences aren't connected, "sausage/Würstchen" is just a basic insult.
---
Even playing the game 12 hours a day if your not killing other players you won’t go up?
---
When I "pvped" as a Warlock I used to mana drain lowbie casters in combat so they couldn't cast their spells, curse of weakness melees, kill their pets, fear them etc.  All the stuff that does no damage but ruins their lives lol.
---
Then your stuck with slower leveling and unnecessary and over powered heals.
---
Maybe when you hit BRD and up is when you go holy/disc but I would never put a point into holy unless im getting BIS gear. 
---
Disc isn’t bad for an all around spec but you still need to get spirit tap or your useless as a solo. Then once you get shadow form it’s a big mistake to not take it up and breeze past the last 20 levels.
---
There is no point in camping don't worry, they will kill once or twice and move on.
---
Idk that seems like a pretty weak argument. It has a specific meaning in the USA, and everywhere else it has absolutely no meaning whatsoever. Seems safe to assume the only defined definition is being used.
---
Not quite. Bosses have phases.
---
i.e. Onyxia's damage in phase 1 is pathetic when your tank is actually wearing a shield. You could keep her in phase 1 for as long as you wanted and your healers will never run out of mana. The cleanest kills have a slow, controlled phase 1 where your DPS stay behind the top 2 tanks in threat for the entirety of the phase, allowing for a smooth transition in phase 3.
---
Running in with a dual wielding tank and trying to build a massive threat lead while your DPS go all out in phase 1 adds unnecessary complexity to what should be the easiest fight in the game. You're much more likely to have deaths with this strategy. Maybe you won't wipe - it's still an easy fight even if half your raid dies - but why risk it?
---
There are no style points for boss kills (unless you're a streamer). The loot is the same. Just wear a shield and it makes everyone's job easier.
---
I am enjoying my time currently. In 2004, I was in the Army. With deployments, field time, special duties...I missed most of the progression. I finally quit trying when Wrath dropped.
---
Now it's back and I work rotating 8s. I found a good guild, but normally have to log when folks start getting on. Pugs work, but again, it can take awhile to get what you need when in the off hours and I'm not working. I love it, but life never seems to allow me to play it like I want to.
---
So for now, I just do the alt leveling thing and will probably continue to do so until something else more sustainable comes around (Diablo 4).
---
Good :)
---
Shout out to Dwarven Overlords, Clan Battlehammer, and Clan Hammersong!
---
Undead... so still ugly
---
its even funnier when you know that every pvp enthousiast who got sweet epics is salivating at the idea of farming the people that already complain.
---
A wires connection connected to a router has a lot more stability than a 5g connection. It would be cheaper to juat upgrade your house internet then use shitty 5g. 4g will be better for gaming than 5g

What's that energy bar ticker add on?

Shadowho?
---
Was, yes. Her role in leading the charge for a faction breaking off from the Scourge's control was great, playing Varimathras at his own game while they fleshed out out her relation to he who murdered her. After that she didn't get much attention from Blizzard other than as a ceremonial faction leader prop, and then come Cataclysm they decided to pit her against a new foe, the Worgen, which were again promptly wiped from Gilneas and thr conflict was put on hold. Ganking Vol'jin to make her Warchief was a shit move, her defeating Saurfang did away with years of establishing his character in an unjustified way, and now they turned up the waifu juice to eleven against the Lich King, once worked up as a mayor threat that required the world's greatest and a miracle to defeat.
---
They turned a moving, nuanced story into a mustache twirling villain, an anime tier mary sue depending on shock value and mammering hot topic slogan dialogue. Her current writing is insulting, but this many expansions, boiling frog is in full effect and I think most Blizzard writers actually believe themselves.
---
Who knows if thats gonna even be the case, getting r14 is the only time consuming thing. The other ranks that give you access to gear are not very hard to get.
---
.
---
I mean, you could get r14 playing 4 hours a day.  The entire idea is you have to get the MOST honor out of whatever number of thousands to gain the achievement of rank 14.  Those who want that title are willing to put up the numbers.  You’re playing against the other players, who are also dedicated, not some arbitrary raid boss.

Most shredded 9 year old ever RIP

No dishonorable kills only apply to NPCS labeled as Civilian.

This comment is like an unironic take on /r/gamersriseup

Two all dwarf guilds: clan Battlehammer and Dwarven Overlords.
---
Dwarf and gnome but still rad as hell: clan Hammersong.
---
Just some FYI.
---
It was really fun running SMGY back when every group had 2-3 Mages in them but none of them thought to dispel Veil of Shadow (-75% healing) from the tank :D
---
Fish recipes.  I leveled them concurrently and only bought different versions of clam meat to push higher.  It does require some travel to get cheap ones.

He's not homo, and neither am I.

Youre getting the cream of the crop

If you are arcane power you will get 5/5 MA regardless. No wand spec and 2/3 arcane explosion. Let me know if you want the spec.
---
The thing is that most players are not interested in lore thus know only the bare minimal. To the ignorant the dark lady was just a pretty and edgy ghost. 
---
She had only a few informed fans such as pyromancer and hirumaredx

Do you know off the top of your head what fish recipes are good?

Well. Sorry to break it to ya but for your hunter that Blackstone ring is pre-bis... have fun doing princess run after princess run...
---
I feel your pain though. Trying to get groups where everyone just simply knows their role is hard there it seems.
---
I leveled almost exclusively in dungeons, but that was a while ago. Also on a horde dominated server as alliance solo grinding was literally unplayable. I assume most questions like this are about endgame at this point.
---
Wow, lol. Easy there.
---
Playing a shaman sounds like fun
---
Its really not a big deal.
---
Go to a city: "LF enchanter", negotiate price, meet up and boom youre done in a few minutes.
---
Or just watch the trade chat for a bit, youre bound to see some "Enchanter LF work" ads.
---
Yikes
---
Hydro, Zevrim, Alzzin to 50% (don't clear the 3 packs) and skip.
---
You can solo it fairly easily at 60.
---
Steroids can be super bad for cardiovascular health. Combining that with a congenital heart defect is asking for trouble.
---
Why do you need proof of that? Its not like its super speedy or anything. Some other guilds do it in under 40 minutes. 1 hour is easy to do if you have an experienced raid team with proper consumes that are ready for it.
---
My guild clear in 1 hour 20 min ourselves and we dont really rush or anything. We just dont sit around and do nothing when we have the mana to go pull the next trash or boss. We could probably easily shave that down to 1 hour if we did the Garr strat where you just offtank adds and nuke, and we spent less time on each boss making sure everyone had their marks and assignments.

Shaman, pali, hunter are 3 very good options into mage.
---
I really love priests renew because that way I can constantly life tap between the ticks of the renew and the priest won't have to bother with me, we both win. :D
---
You missed something about rogues, sometimes they DO focus skull, that is when they pop blade flurry on pull while pumping out max dps during the effect
---
I feel like potions are one of the few exceptions where it’s fine to click because they’re used kind of rarely and not part of a regular rotation
---
Do you just like shitting on people?  Why does this matter to you so much?
---
Very good argument.
---
I mean nice revenge, but u just fed him content
---
Thanks buddy. I think I'm going to have to learn fishing then to speed this along. I was hoping there would be more food to buy on the auction house
---
I get terrible ping when I'm on 2.4. I'd gladly run a wire, but I'd need a USB NIC and that just seems like a problem waiting to happen. My router is a Nighthawk ac1750. I know it's a bit older now but it's not like I'm using some junky router either.
---
Until another country invades yours ;) then you'll be begging for it.
---
Ditto
---
To be fair, 1v1 shadow priests are one of the strongest classes in the game...
---
I try to keep my health at around 80%, keeping myself at full wastes health regen that could be used for life tapping and less than that is risky. But during combat, and it's hectic, I got maybe 50% health and really need to life tap, I life tap and use my Healthstone right away, I get both mana and leftover health. I never really use life tap twice in a row, during a rotation when I'm at 10% mana I do at least 1 shadowbolt in between to give wiggle room.
---
You can skip, just tame whatever pet has the ability and use in a couple fights till you learn it
---
HOTW is better than deep resto for raids at the beginning at least. Only spec that is better is Moonglow
---
All these people replying have no idea what the fuck youre talkiing about apparently, LOL.
---
For real.
---
&gt; No im not and neither was he
---
&gt; that's why he's using it in the exact same context
---
&gt; he's just using a term in a similar way
---
When you type things, do you comprehend them yourself? It's like suggesting that you're a racist if you only like one breed of dogs. If you can't see how that's a leap just the same as calling it "stolen valor" to use a guild name that someone else had before then just lmao. Have a good one pal.
---
Missclick =&gt; Sorry can't trade the item, it's bound to me.
---
If the idea was implemented as is with nothing else.
---
I wouldn't call it confrontational. I feel like condescending is a more appropriate term. What you said had nothing to do with the previous topic of conversation.
---
And I keep telling the Shadowbane players about they joy of Neocron and it's intense PvP centered around capturing installations that enabled the top research/crafting possibilities.
---
We definitely gonna be downvoted but it's really not that hard to tank in classic. Theres always somebody posting on here acting like they speak for all tanks with their seemingly offbeat quirks about other roles or groupmates.
---
 If your dps are potatoes and your healer has no clue where he is, instead exasterbating the problem by arguing in /p or posting paragraphs on reddit, just find a new and better group, instantly, because youre a tank.
---
It ain't ninja-ing if everyone agrees to it at the start of the dungeon.
---
I ain't gonna run a group with people who disagree on this topic with me for both our sanity's sake.
---
It was crashing the servers and lagging the clients long before WoW retail engine.   
---
But for smaller fights etc it was really freaking charming and engaging.
---
I know, I just don't understand why you're not doing like everyone and paying the flat 15g asking price. It's a fair price, regardless of the amount of runs it takes.
---
You dont need to be in a raid to get world buffs. People can get them on their own time.
---
The time you spend together as 40 people however is valuable, so reducing this time through world buffs ensures less chance that something goes wrong, the MT disconnects, someone goes afk, whatever.
---
Thinking about it in terms of the total time spent is not how you should see it.

---
What? Lol. This is such a dumb take. Try and think logically.
---
Any mage with a brain will deadzone lock a hunter and melt them as the hunter sits there helpless
---
Two times zero is still zero.
---
Here I'll break it down some more:
---
Some groups want good players. 
---
If you aren't a good player don't be surprised when those groups don't want you. 
---
No one owes you an invite, make your own groups where you can have an "adventure" in the 15 year old content while you all do 100-200 dps. 
---
There's nothing wrong with people having standards.
---
&gt;  The new level cap for retail will be 60,
---
"Classic is really popular" /some metrics guy.    
---
"It's because they love lvl 60!, let's make retail lvl 60, get Ion on the line!" /J Allen Brack      
---
"Wtf is it now Allen?" /Ion, fed up with this shit.

"
---
They will return to Classic once Naxx or even AQ comes.
---
healer here. I keep a hots on my locks, and they get heals in combat when it won't ruin my mana budget. if when i'm done drinking they are at low health still then I heal them.  Most of the time they will eat or bandage. A few will go into combat oom, lap to under 10% and cry when they don't get healed that pull. 
---
I am fine with you tapping, I am fine with you tapping in combat. just please dont tap under 50% in combat and don't run into combat oom to tap away.
---
No, youre wrong, and a whiny baby who is throwing a tantrum on reddit because he misunderstood what someone was saying and only emotionally reacted to the phrase used and leaped to the defense of The TroopsTM.
---
I suspect that someone with that behavior score higher than average in the psychopath scale.
---
Camping anyone is bad imo, but if they rez and try to fight again or quest/farm in the same spot they are fair game.   
---
If appropriate level fights mobs - they are fair game as well, its part of wpvp. Actually, everything is part of it but some moves are dick moves and some not, so it comes down to whether or not you want to be a dick.
---
I miss our OOC rezzer. It was really amazing lol.
---
I don't target lowbies when I'm out and about. Hell I don't ever try to start shit with people my own level because we clearly just want to get whatever we are doing done.
---
Until I get killed by 60s rolling by, dismounting, and killing me.  Over.  And over.  And over.  And when I'm trying to quest and they kill me over and over and over, but as soon as a friendly 60 shows up they are suddenly friendly.
---
I've lost hours upon hours being killed by higher levels.  If I decide it's time to get some revenge, you're god damned right I'm going to go get some.

That's what the plan was but there doesn't seem to be many people selling fish on the auction house.

Some people’s first experience with wow has been classic and it would be stupid to not give them a path to retail.

Best place as a lvl 57 rogue to solo grind mobs for the Krol blade?

I think it’s more likely that he misspelled lose

I haven't swapped it to Bene since I first made it.

"We will watch closely for ~~monetization opportunities~~ your feedback"
---
When I was leveling in Stranglethorn Vale, I was ganked SO often by high lvl Horde players. I hate being ganked but could tolerate it, up until people started camping outside of booty bay. 
---
After a couple of deaths I made my way to other low-level spots to take my revenge on noobs, since I can’t do anything to players that are 8+ levels ahead of me.But everytime I saw a player I just couldn’t bring myself to do it. It’s like killing a puppy, they don’t even have a mount yet. I can understand feeling frustrated but to actually kill players that have grey levels is beyond me.

#notallwarlocks
---
Fucking thank you
---
I'd suggest at least 4 people  I've seen people die as a 3 man with tank/dps/heals
---
Oh shit thank you, so those are the only ones I need to know before resetting and relearning goblin? Thank you
---
i mean if you kill someone that is fighting mobs then camp them constantly after that then you deserve to be camped by their main
---
Seems like a quality of life issue that doesn't affect the spirit of Classic. I'd be all for it and tbh it probably should have been implemented from the start. I bet a lot of people wouldn't have even noticed the difference.
---
Yeah with moonglow I really notice the difference in sheer mana savings and longevity. But I think now that we have much of molten core on farm status...really how important is being moonglow spec?
---
Especially with all the shamans dominating the meters with chain heal heh. And the priests with their sheer throughput. I’m just the guy there for innervate and improved mark of the wild.
---
The title of this post is "Best 'caster-slayer' class?" and so you suggest running away as a hunter? Genius
---
Also, he gets angry for having a "spy" on his stream, which he publishes himself, but has that stupid addon that lets you target enemies who are closeby. Fuckin pussy addon.
---
&gt;	No argument, calling names
---
I can’t respond to your comments because you’re literally not saying anything
---
I really don’t know much about zyzz other than his videos helped inspire my little brother to lose over 100 pounds. So rip zyzz. I’m sure my bro wasn’t the only one inspired by him.
---
A GM will also have a tag next to their name that says "Blizz". 
---
They'll also never ask you for any account info.
---
I don't really care if someone sees my spec, but I like the idea of someone inspecting my hunter and seeing I'm specced Oomkin
---
Yep :D
---
Once all the people who thought p2 would be amazing cuz world pvp realize after a week they hate the fact they cant do jack shit without having a raid full of people camping their corpse at all times, blizz will def release WSG early.
---
Don’t say that too loud! I love when rogues underestimate my warlock lol.
---
how small and how far in are you. It might be worth it down the line if your server dies before AQ and you wanna keep playing
---
What are yalls thoughts on the new expansion ?
---
That’s true
---
Well if you dont want to get dead zoned, and you want to kill mage you keep distance and chip at them. This is common as fuck. Youre getting to upset and not trying to listen. Its litterally every thing a hunter does in every matchup, "kite".
---
You have had enough time to hit 60 before phase 2 hit. It’s really that simple.
---
What is edgemasters price on your server right now?
---
Honestly if people are still falling for this after 15 years, they deserve it.
---
Nothing of value being lost from people who can only play 30m a day.
---
Playing devils advocate here is he could have a 12 side button mouse and has the abilities set for comfort.

---
Yes, this is a scam.
---
Also report it as a phishing site. It forwards your login info to Blizzard. When Blizzard sends a code to your email, the phishing site requests that code. A that point, they have your account.

Ones a figure of speech, ones a pretty specific term.

&gt;This comment is like an unironic take on [/r/gamersriseup](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamersriseup) 
---

And youre comments are so thoughtful and full of content. Shut the fuck up lmao
---
But the alliance is so honorable
---
It's impossible to grind specifically for a Krol blade. Just farm money and buy it
---
If someone does that I unlock it and wait until I get at least 1g tipped. If they don't tip anything after trading me without saying anything, they can eat a dick. I'll gladly lockpick for free if you whisper beforehand.
---
I guess I was holding out hope for the Sylvanas that cried and sang when my blood elf brought her a necklace.
---
I do too belive phase two will bring in most of the fun, cause ppl will have a real reason to pvp, but what am saying is for the future releases, where you finish getting all your raiding gear, and then a new raid comes and you have to do it again, its not that holding back if ppl are having fun, and a lot of ppl didnt even raid, or even get to lvl 60, and im not preventing anyone from doing anything, you can go out in the world and kill players you just dont do it because you need a sense of accomplishment in the form of ranks. i dont need classic do be for over 2 years, but i want to enjoy my time and not think Im sprinting through the whole content
---
Yes. 800 if you wait for R3 pvp
---
Nice dress dude
---
Dusty times have a 20% chance to be class books and a .1% chance to be fodor's compendium of dragon slaying. The rest are the pat nagle book and pocket lint.
---
2 months to hit 60 is not slow. 
---
You’re comparing yourself against the streamers who hit 60 within the first few days and think oh that’s just totally casual that you took two months. 
---
Naw. Try not logging into the game for 25 days and counting like some of my friends. Real life takes precedence and they’ll be maximum level 30 four months from now. 
---
Try THAT for casual.
---
Yeah I have friends who served, I'm completely aware. But I also don't pretend sitting in a chair eating microwaved hamburgers while you play with pixels for 12 hours a day close to equivalent dude. 👌
---
I do too, but before doing that I try to get their attention. Example on my Hunter I send my pet at them from shadow-meld a couple of times, then when I get them hooked looking for me I log out to one of my alts leveling far away somewhere else.
---
Many people ended up on completely unbalanced servers though. If the ratio is 3 to 1, there is no PvP. Just steamrolling.
---
You obviously cannot read.
---
Oily blackmouth/stranglekelp.  They will skyrocket in price (probably already have) for free action potions.
---
Beyond that, engineering materials should soar as well, for all levels of engineering.  A lot of people will be leveling it for the first time.  Many others will be leveling goblin engineering.
---
Classic+
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Make it an epic quest to collect them all.
---
You and me disagree, and that is fine. But for me personally the world in classic feels like a world (in the way its designed and how all the players and stories fit into it) while in retail thats just not the case.
---
Seems cool, won’t play it.
---
He’s referring to 5ghz WiFi, not 5g cellular.
---
I was so close to fall for it. It's so funny. I feel a little bit embarrassed now.   
---
high and paranoid is not a good combo.
---
&gt;Its insane that they're putting it back into the game. Literally the worst, most toxic ladder system you could conceive of if you set out to try. I can't believe it. You all will see.
---
To be fair, you can make the argument that a lot of things in classic are bad design. This isn't the only one.
---
If the average gold farm is lets say 30 gold per hour and you want 1000 gold then thatd take you 33 hours. Farming isnt fun or enjoyable, its tedious and repetitive. Time is money, your time is valuable.  Ive never bought gold but id rather spend a minimum wage amount of money per hour times that 33 to get 1000 gold than spend all that time doing it myself. Then i can spend those 33 hours ingame doing things that are fun with that gold instead of killing the same mobs over and over or farming mara over and over.
---
Don't forget the coke.
---
Locks are best 1v1 class.
---
No on really does super well against warlocks. Much like no one really does well against shadow priests.
---
The fear+dot classes are nasty.

---
Any word on when paid server transfers will be available? I know that I have a few friends who rolled a different server to avoid queues and they want to migrate and join us.
---
This is classic/vanilla and that is exactly what this game does.
---
you can have keybinds set for target markers as well.

In vanilla it used to be a lot longer than 15 minutes? I remember this being terrible. Lost sleep over this quest until I finally completed it!

---
Amazing fucking editing, great job man!
---
By the way, I'd like to make my own PvP montage soon, I was wondering where do you get your meme sounds and visuals?
---
Do you take everything so literally? Or only when you have the chance to get upset?
---
idk who you're playing with, but 90% of the time I'm in groups with locks they don't do this
---
I know right?
---
Hilarious.
---
Yes and people definitely do it. That’s why alts are nice to have.
---
This is a beast of its own, man. It is in a different category. The only thing that even came close to how bad this was from original vanilla was letting, e.g., C'thun sit there mathematically impossible for months without tuning while guilds beat their heads against the wall on it, but that's not coming back and even that was not as bad as this is.
---
I explained in the post how it's currently not authentic even artificially so.
---
I said "it's not like you stop running MC." The game is farming, it also has been and still is in retail. If everyone who takes the game remotely seriously has been farming the end game content for weeks already, when is the appropriate time to release the next content?
---
Is there even any negatives if they released BWL tomorrow? It's not like guilds will stop doing MC or Ony. I'm in a hardcore guild and half of them are raid logging already because that's all there is for them at this point.
---
Depends on if they want to change it or not, if they're going off vanilla then yeah it should be.
---
Your hook shot knocked you unconscious, so I laid down next to you so everyone would think we were chillin'
---
I always backpeddle forwards
---
Honestly I wouldn't be surprised as I never see anyone else.
---
If you’re willing to pay for it, Zygor makes a phenomenal questing addon.
---
While this is a great idea for his situation, it kind of breaks the server even more.
---
There’s a setting to make the texts instant instead of waiting for it to slowly show up Incase you didn’t know lol. I didn’t find out till I was lvl 14 and it was very annoying
---
Azeroth auto pilot will get you leveled really quick but you will forfeit some things like some elite quests and doing what you feel like doing.
---
I've been trying to figure out a way to detect if a Hunter is using growl for like two weeks now without having to watch for the visual cue. I saw that details! reports the spells people use. Would details report Hunter's pet's using growl?
---
It's ironic because for pvp prot, Imp Revenge/Anticipation/Imp Disarm are your clutch talents.
---
As long as they are actually playing and not boting it's fine
---
You should join the 49 discord (the invite is searchable in this subreddit somewhere). 49 is an incredible bracket because the difference in available skills when compared to 60 is marginal. You have so much more flavour than sub 30 twinking, and it opens it up to interesting specs and gear sets.
---
Gear is admittedly a bit more of a task to get with pieces coming from BRD, Mara, ST etc, but it’s a great bracket for those who don’t want to/have time to play level 60 end game content. You can also really surprise fresh level 60s and gank them, particularly as a 49 hunter with having ranged physical DPS. Even geared 60s (the eight classes) who don’t world pvp often can be downed satisfyingly.
---
Grasshopper....tell me it's you from ashkandi ???
---
They only opened up Transfers to help overpopulated servers and made the transfers to another server of the same type. 
---
A pvp server plays differently in every aspect so the economy is massively different so for a player who made their fortune on a pvp to transfer to a pve server would upset the balance of the economy of the server receiving pvp refuges. 
---
Blizzard are far too cautious to allow something like that to happen so I would be extremely surprised if they allowed transfers to an existing server but a brand new PVE server made for PVP players who want to move I could see happening.
---
This but unironically

I understand the way you have it is more efficient, but is there a problem with using the xx and yy variables?
---
Theres that human lad in Stonard who says thr forsaken will betray the Horde as he gets poisoned.
---
Cause it is, it's an option in the addon I just told you about.
---
Nope. ShestakUI classic, which used ouf is 1000x better than all of these suggestions.
---
For a German, that might as well have been punching a wall
---
I do the nicer version where I just do /me hugs you.
---
Im aight with it, just have a MC weapon and u can dps tank my dungeons any day.
---
If you tank, tell the healer that you're needing whatever upgrade you have that he doesn't need, if you heal, tell the tank that you'll need on whatever stuff that he greeds on. Either way as a holy/prot paladin you have 0 items that other classes need as a prot paladin tanking dungeons except maybe a weapon like Ironfoe drops. And as a healer either way you're getting to mc because people want paladins in their raids. The weapon you took from the warlock is fine because it's Bis-ish for prot paladins (but not rly) and the mob is rare, while the feet drop so much it's not worth stealing them from the druid. Warriors can't tank in raids, those that are tanking are all in full purples and bis (or in my raids wearing mail and a lvl 30 green cape), they tank to need on dps gear and tanking upgrades if they are tanking and its fine
---
Saving this lol
---
Using this a June 2020 p2 would have been appropriate for me haha. Early December would mean playing 40 hours a week. Yea no
---
No just someone trying to be edgy, and or an anal retentive coder ... lol
---
ShestakUI classic.
---
You can send your thank you letters to thesmoosh-thunderfury.
---
Slow big dmg for AA +MS /WW combos ?
---
You're right. Waiting for the healer to drink is a much faster clear speed
---
No only 94s 57c
---
Wtf
---
Literally ANY decent guild.
---
You might be right my dude
---
Funny enough, I just got into a party with four feral druids and me the Rogue. One healed, one tanked, other two did melee dps with me. Do I even need any of the other classes? XD
---
&gt;I'm a Paladin tank
---
Case closed.
---
I just got this at Lv 32 well 33 after the run, and it was the first time I ran it ever in my life. I can't even use it till like 37.  I'm told it might still be worse the the whirlwind axe I'm using though which is a class quest reward so I don't get it.
---

I probably shouldn't reply to you, but I am neither of those. I have written a handful of addons, I doubt you have ever opened a single .lua file.

Rofl, I make it a habit to run through STV and Darkshire killing all alliance on sight when I need to go to Swamp of Sorrows. Gotta show the filthy Alliance their place. It is especially fun when 60s start to chase you and you escape /waving at them as they pointlessly chase you when you have same mount movement speed. You forget that we are at war with the other faction. I get killed by others all the time needlessly, I’m sure as hell not gonna stay my blade when the enemy is nearby

I absolutely sold runs of low level dungeons to get my epic mount way back when. 5g a person and everything's yours.
---
Herbalism is the same.
---
I ran from the Feralas FP to thousand needles all to Gadgetzan and did a lap around Tanaris. I got like two herbs the whole time.
---
Would be cool if the threat meter didn't already list me at #1 on threat
---
Artificial spellbatching is a change already.
---
Can confirm. We carried someone to rank 14 who was terrible (granted, we won pretty much every match). It takes no skill to hit 14, just time and a team.
---
Joined a UBRS 5-man Rend run as a tank. Priest disconnected and we couldn't find another healer for some reason. Got a tank instead and I finished the run in my bushy shoulders.
---
We're fucking amazing.
---
Isn't it against ToS to charge for addons?
---
Noob speaking but isnt 5cp SD a complete waste in most non-raid boss encounters?
---
This would be the only valid excuse to play a hunter.
---
I’m lvl 50 now, been playing on  and off since launch, enjoying the ride, helping guildies in zones I’ve finished and just wasting time. I regret nothing, I know I’ll be around 55-56 when p2 comes out and I’ll probably get killed o freaking lot. No reason to QQ though, was my decision and my priorities that brought me here.  Hopefully it won’t be impossible to get to 60 though 😅
---
Been doing this since classic launch on Pagle. Half the people go "Hey WTF"
---
Please keep these coming. Quality over quantity but in your case the former doesn’t seem to be a challenge, so keep em comin Snacky

They were both from Deltarune, made by Toby Fox (Undertale dude). First one is the checker king's theme, second is the main battle theme.
---
What DPS class has the best balance between leveling speed and endgame viability/ease of gearing?
---
Ohh ok, I always assumed they were only a thing in MC and BWL.
---
This is why i kill lowbies on my lowbie rogue. Its way more fun, even if i do have blue weps with fiery.  I actively engage on 2v1s and win and it feels rewarding.
---
Jumping onto top comment to mention - DO NOT USE FLASH HEAL LIKE THIS!!!!
---
It is SUPER mana inefficient, it is for emergencies not general healing.
---
Something like 
---
/run SetRaidTarget("target",x)
---
Replace x with a number from 1 to 8
---
It's only updated on [Github](https://github.com/Aviana/LunaUnitFrames/releases).
---
At level 60 are we talking pvp in EPL Or STV
---
Cause those are very different experiences.
---
When I say wpvp I mean fighting other 60s.
---
And as an alliance player on a Horde dominate server, I have the years and experience to know how "fun" that's going to be for a solo player warrior.
---
Cant beat em? Beat up their younger siblings who can't defend themselves.

Is a white swing just an auto attack

Like I said, try /join World  It's typically a far more populated channel
---
They could release every phase tomorrow and it would have zero impact on hardcore raiders for months and zero impact on casuals forever. Blizz can either lose players in 8 months because "they rushed content and people will have completed vanilla and get bored" or lose players in 2 weeks because "people completed phase 1 and got bored."
---
People will bitch about anything.
---
Not how that works, though. Goldseller accounts are likely created through fraudulent means - presumably utilizing credit card chargebacks or illegally obtained credit card information. They don't pay a dime for the account.

Rattlegooooooore!!!!

You dont get honor for corpse ganking
---
My group of friends landed on Kromcrush during the opening Zerg and it’s been the best server in a lot of regards. Mostly because it’s very well balanced and has great PVE guilds on both sides, which should make the pvp fun.
---
Warlock, easily. High dps when they get +hit and there’s not many locks so getting tier pieces is a cake walk. That and leveling is quick with a pet and low downtime.
---
Because good pvpers have nothing to gain by ganking lowbies.  
---
If someone is ganking lowbies it's usually because they're not good enough to gank people their own level so they go and flex on the only people who fear them.
---
Cool bro
---
Lmaooo no way did they not kill a single one of you. I guess they really needed the 30 or so levels on your guildies eh?
---
Azeroth Auto Pilot. This is what you are looking for.
---
What gear are you looking for to be able to heal in that spec? Just pure +healing?
---
Can you elaborate?
---
&gt; you have to fuck with the settings a bit but vuhdo is great for classic too
---
Last time I checked it didn't work with HealComm though.
---
That's good to hear! I think I may roll a human Warlock. Male or female is the question, though...
---
What build are you using?
---
No, I mean wedged into the structure of the wall itself in a way that disabled any form of movement. Couldnt take a single step or jump in any direction.
---
WoW is the mcdonalds of fantasy, who gives a shit which over-the-top hero did an anime flip and killed the other over-the-top edgelord hero. Vanilla wow is good because it doesnt tell you what the plot is. You're just some shmuck dropped in the world and the story is what ganker you got revenge on, what dude helped you with a quest for an hour, who was caught embezzling from the guild bank and the 3 hour BRD run you barely beat and made some close  friends along the way.
---
Nice shoulder tits.
---
Yes, and possibly even in some boss encounters depending on how fast your raid is killing bosses. It's up to your discretion when to has eviscerate instead.
---
It's pretty much how healing is today I think, just more effective since it wasn't always the same rank of the heal.
---
Don't know about that specifically but Auctioneer has a lot of good options for helping with the AH. I have it but I honestly don't use a lot of the features because I'm not working super hard on that.
---
I mainly just use the appraiser, batch post and snatch features.
---
Feral druids don't really need their mana bar in a decent 5man group so coordinate with them to drop you heals between pulls
---
Ignore and move on. I legit just wasted my life reading this the same way you wasted yours hy engaging with this person for more than 2 seconds
---
for PVE? something like that doesn't NEED to be spell bound/learned. hell you can click your rotation and do just fine. PVP is the only thing that can require you to mouse turn in situations
---
Ah rly ? My fault then. Other than that I couldn't see them wanting to do this for you anyways.
---
Nice
---
ok thx for the help might hit u with some questions coming up here thank u again!
---
There was an old trick in vanilla if you were a warlock with goblin jumper cables and were specced into master demonologist and demonic sacrifice.
---
Sacrifice the demon, resurrect it with the jumper cables, and get both the sacrifice buff and master demonologist buff. 
---
Can anyone confirm if this works or not?
---
More armour less ego
---
One played by actual, real people, who want to enjoy themselves. If you can't understand that I'm truly sorry for you.
---
Not every bubble, I think the first ranks might not last long enough for the heartstone cast, better check that first
---
What if I told you you don't understand the point of my comment and the parent comment of mine?
---
I'd agree with that. If you can find 1 good healer and maybe a dps you should be fine. You wont need a full team.
---
Such edge
---
Daily reminder to stop being a colossal pussy.
---
Am i doing this right?
---
Yes anyone who disagrees with you is a low life NEET. You claim to be for “fun” but then talk down to anyone who’s version of fun is actually trying to optimize their play while blaming it on “streamers” which has nothing to do with it. You’ve got a lot of growing up to do kid good luck with that.
---
Do you run damage meters and pay attention to them?  I'm open to the possibility that you're a god with Shadow Priests, I'm sure some exist out there, but are you willing to commit to the statement that you can compete with Rogues for single target DPS?  If I can hold the aggro away from a rogue consistently there's no reason a shadow priest should be stealing it (which is what consistently happens on bosses) unless they were competitive with the rogue (which they've never been in my experience).
---
You see, there's literally no reason for me to lie as I don't play a DPS class, they're not my competition, and I'd prefer to take another clothie that doesn't compete on my loot.  It's all upsides for me having a shadow priest in the group if I didn't have such atrocious experiences with them.
---
I'm so glad i am not the only one.
---
Can you link me a clique restoration druid guide? On Google they're all years outdated. But from what I've seen, I use mouse hotkeys plus shift+mouse hotkeys with rejuv, regrowth, and like rank 4 Healing touch and max rank, along with some other hotkeys for decursing, or possibly insect swarm or FF. Not sure what is the most optimal set up, might just have to experiment.
---
His justification is that **other people** were dicks to him, so now he's going to be a dick just like them, to random strangers.
---
Same. But with Hand of Justice.
---
That's kind of how I see it. I've been HotW/NS this whole time. Now with most of my raid having at least a few pieces of MC/Ony gear I maybe hit 5th on the heal chart. But with my innervate my #1 healer does even more. That's fine with me. He'll double my output on any given night. Whatever, he can't b-rez.
---
I ran private WoW servers when you were probably in Grade School kid.

---
Expecting anyone to get it would not even be considered min-maxing I think, it's just so inconceivably rare. Xn (warlock from APES) has done over 1100 runs and still hasn't gotten it.
---
Or maybe you're thinking too much about this and some people just like to virtue signal.
---
Ah alliance sneaking in the sewers like the rats everybody know they are, not surprised at all actually.
---
In pubg dungeons it astounds me that there is still so much confusion and blame getting thrown around for things as to how healers should heal and how warlocks should manage resources. 
---
If theres 1 lock in the party, and the tank is leveled/geared enough, then on regular pulls the healer should be routinely keeping a deleveled rejuvination/overtime heal on the lock to maximize dps throughout the dungeon. This obviously changes on bigger pulls or boss fights. This is obviously not true if there is some problem with the tank dying fast, then the warlock needs to manage resources differently, switch in drain life/wanding etc. If you're a warlock, and your healer isn't giving you rejuvs constantly even though your warrior never dips under 80% hp, just keep mouth shut and keep going, because the healer is either not used to maximizing dps, or he has a vendetta against warlocks, either way, arguing wont fix it.
---
Paladin threat was bugged right after classic launched so it's possible it could be again. Some people thought it was caused from switching judgements on the target but who knows.
---
I believe the prices were swapped in the TBC prepatch which will not be in classic. 800g is the cheapest if that's true if you get PvP rank 3.
---
wait it isn't darkshore?
---
He is semi-rare but everyone in the group can check 2-3 times each run so that's 20-30 possible Jed IDs which makes it (in my experience at least) unlikely that you don't get a Jed each run
---
I totally agree. The fact that elemental mastery is literally twice as powerful as it's supposed to be, completely defying the tooltip just because of spell batching, an artificial system... is... insane. I am all for no changes, but this is just dumb IMO.
---
As in a link to that a specific players profession? So you could see their level and recipes learned?

Why would we not consider the implications to free speech when looking at ways to combat online radicalization? There must be a tipping point where free speech outweighs any governmental interest in stopping terrorism. 
---
I think that tipping point can be different for each person, for me personally, the bar is extremely high for any type of speech regulation.

the amount of ppl that think that bolvar died in the cinematic is an indication that a lot of people that talk shit about retail know nothing about the current game really lol

What? Potions are one the things you should absolutely have on hotkey, because when do you want to drink a potion? When you're at low hp and want to get some HP **fast**. If you click them you're going to do it like this guy and search for them on your bar and die before you can get to them.
---
And he's still completely wrong, about half the people playing daily in my guild of well over 100 are sub 50, all take the game seriously and just don't have the time to play because they are adults with a life outside of WoW to worry about. Most is still wrong.
---
I've started putting in lvl 1 water
---
&gt;The only people who can will be on the imbalanced servers on the overpopulated side.
---
And they won't stay there for long if there is no one to kill outside BG's as the alliance will just turtle up not fight and corpse walk to dungeons.
---
I just did a guild run tonight. Full ubrs to help get a friends and family player ony attuned. Mh/oh/carapace dropped. Finally got mh. Finkles dropped. Got that so I can skin ony now. It's like ubrs heard my cries and said run #53 is the last one you ever need to do. I think I'm happier than when I got the shadow flame staff on my vanilla mage after using a sorc dagger for a year.

Yes, I know. But I was talking about increasing your damage relative to your non-crit frostbolts, in which case your current crit% doesn't at all.

"a good fight" that includes waiting for the allies to pull an elite dragon NPC then killing them?

I haven't seen a queue for Bigglesworth recently and the balance isn't too bad. Generally Alliance is always the underdog. If the other posters are correct then Kromcrush could be good. Read a lot of bad things regarding faction balance for Skeram but you can't be too sure on those numbers.
---
Yeah I have been looking for a good deal on it.
---
Balanced hahahahaha
---
Oh honey. Sweetie no.
---
I think the intention was: to achieve a high rank you had to be "on the front of war" for a long time. And since killing players was never the objective of any of the battlegrounds, you just had to play a lot. They made the pvp rankings like the grind of the rest of the game. I had to run strat undead 18 times one night for one piece of gear. I think the rankings should be similar. You're grinding for some of the best gear in the game and I'm okay with how the system is. How can you be a grand marsahall or a high warlord if you aren't "on the front" day in and day out?

---
I really wish so many of you Allis didn't leave when the free transfers came up. I would much prefer the original 60/40 split (even though I'd really love a 50/50). Fighting alliance on Skeram kind of feels like kicking a puppy (except for the people in &lt;Pretty Good&gt;. fuck them)
---
Bur
---
The **ONLY** thing I am offended by as a hunter is the "doing no damage" part. Boi I can do more damage than (almost) anyone else on a group of 1-3 mobs *provided I didn't go oom 5 seconds into the previous pull.*
---
Looks like Edgemaster's might be what I save for instead of an epic mount.
---
Yup.  Imagine telling a rogue that he can’t roll on a dagger because he uses swords, lol.
---
lol the guards weren't quite able to put us in jail XD
---
    The problem with this approach is you want an item that is not known or popular because there is a wealth of knowledge out there. 
---
   Youre gonna really have to do research to find which way the market is moving and what could potentially be worth a lot down the road.

Love the idea! Thanks!

The bag is red, and the only reddish trolls I know of are of the Zandalari tribe who are friendly to both factions. You monster.

relevant username, but don't see you being pedantic
---
You'll be fine, will be more world pvp than before, but that will also go down once battlegrounds are released. Anyway, this is why pvp servers are exciting. PvE is just dull in comparison.
---
Raids reset on Tuesday. Most Guilds and players that will buy mats or consumables will be online Tuesday/Wednesday.  
---
Weekends are mass log in times. Price of items will fluctuate but generally are low. Sometimes low by surplus sometimes high by rarity. Often you will see swings and lots of actions.  
---
Consider most markets of consumables as a sine curve. 0 time starts Sunday Late to Monday Late (BUY BUY). Uptick prices peeks Tuesday/Wednesday (Sell Sell). Medium cost stock replenish time is Thursday early Friday (Buy Sell). Friday/Saturday is crazy... up to you.
---
2.5 months to 60 isn't nolifing. You are great at exaggerating.
---
He's right tho.
---
I don't get why there are so few warlocks, actually. They're very useful in groups without lacking in DPS and rather easy to level.
---
You. I like you. Fiercely condescending to the end despite being a braying jackass. If you're not already American, consider yourself an honorary one now.
---
Ok fuck that might be the most insulting thing anyones ever called me. Im gonna go take a shower.

lol
---
V edgy post, very cool.
---
I ran a dude thru RFC like 3 days ago for 15g lol

Jesus. What an overly done macro. Just do /e pickpockets you for 78s. Or whatever amount.
---
I'm fine with it, but don't complain if it escalates and you get fucked up for it.
---
I do this alot it's so funny.
---
Does the priest's "Force of Will" talent in the discipline tree increase healing aswell?
---
You lack awareness.

Is there more than the chicken and the death ray?

It’s actually rather applaudable

I thought this was Argus?
---
Commendable, I'd say, with props and kudos
---
It's the computer, I'm sure. The laptop is in the same room as the tv, and closer to the router. It'll say that it's connected w/o internet but I can't access the router via ip.
---
It’s because you can’t equip your offhand straight to your main hand when you have a main hand equipped. Move the line equipping your shield above the line equipping your sword, and you should be fine.
---
More realistic with a random money amount every time
---
Absolutely NOT.
---
Epic PvP gear is insanely powerful and if it were anything more than extremely hard to get, it would compromise PvE, since the two are intertwined in classic.
---
Blue PvP gear is reasonably obtainable and is also very strong.
---
*laughs in literally every raid except MC*
---
Look at defcamp and melderons YouTube channel, specifically the shaman videos. He presents a very in depth data analysis that indicates that RB is best at all levels, but Windfury us comparable at slower weapon swing speeds. FT undeperforms at all levels, except against extremely high armour targets.
---
As a rule, rockbiter all the time for me.
---
I always liked fast 1handers for consistent damage with a shield.  The enchant isnt to much of a difference.  I think the 3 mentioned are all relatively close depending on mob armor type.
---
Honestly you replace your wepon so much i wouldn't spend alot on a wep enchant. Maybe on ravenger cuz i used that all the way to 60 for aoe groups
---
I still don't understand what the /e is doing
---
Not sure about arcane power being a tiny output increase but ok
---
We like fortnight we like fortnight
---
Ah yes Good ol horde territory, ironforge.
---
Yeah I highly doubt anyone would even notice or care that it's not a different amount.
---
I haven't seen mages charge group members, but I've heard of it second hand. I have had diva mages throw temper tantrums though. More likely to have shitty mages than any other class.
---
Ill take a look thnx &lt;3
---
You aren’t worth any honor for 30s after landing. 
---
Not like it’s going to stop the campers. The smart ones will just CC/whittle you down and kill you 30s later. The dumb ones will kill you as you land.
---
I notice with the 1h on fiery it procs 2-3 times a fight. so that makes sense. Kinda see more dmg that way while leveling tbh
---
Surprised any warriors even tried it, one even tried twice!
---
How does it make it more powerful?
---
He was shredded but not very muscular?
---
He was sub 10% bf at 200lbs, Even at 6'2 that is still very muscular
---
The taller you are the harder it will be to get that "full" look, Which is why 5'5 manlets look so full and wide
---
It does
---
I preferred fiery unless I was fighting mage mobs regularly.
---
I just have tons of gold I dont really care that much tbh, spending 100g on crusader isnt really a problem. I already have epic mount and shit and Im ready for phase 2 already. Lots of data is private servers and not much about classic, so I was curious if fiery or any other enchant was better
---
On the sidebar on the right look for your name. To the right of it is (edit). Click on that

Sounds like Wraak!

"Here’s your downvote, thanks for playing." are u insane? xD

First of all ty , i dont care about upvotes or downvotes lol you literally hit my feelings xD , playing what? :O is that some of those troll attempts that are 10/11 ? &gt;.&gt;

if you read my post you would understand why i said it and the topic in general. ^^ next time read before you being offensive to some1 and make yourself a clown.

I like the idea,  I can make an guy and level purely to 50 in the wotlk expansion before starting new content.

Appreciate it man :)

Good point

I'm glad you enjoyed it :D there's some more here on my youtube of you're interested: https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCgdyswgFk7pcF6SFcNaWthA

That's the best comment I've ever had &lt;3
---
Na, flaunt it if you got it. I wish i was even remotely close to my epic mount but im resto so farming is hard lol
---
Or just be a warlock and do it by yourself killing all three bosses at the same time while not wearing any gear!

---
I like to strip naked and AoE horde sitting on Qia so I get those tasty kills and no durability loss.
---
It is fun. The thing is. When I kill people without an reward. I just feel like that asshole who ganks you for no fucking reason.
---
Now I can tell myself that it is for honor.
---
Gear helps, but in the end, skill as a healer matters more. I've solo tanked UBRS, dual wielding, with a single healer, and were both still in pre-BiS blues. I will say, however, that for some of the nastier pulls towards the end I did have a sheep or two thrown out, and we did have a feral druid innervate the priest twice.
---
And yes, he's the best damn priest I know. Not quite sure how he does it, but it's a blast to tank for him.
---
Yea could get 9% hit to mitigate the hit penalty, but that doesn't change the Glancing Blow penalty. That being said, there is an Undead Warrior in my guild w/o Edgemasters who tops meters on a regular basis. Min/max gear doesn't matter if you dont play well.
---
What's this? A broken link?
---
Even with all those bells and whistles, Retail is pretty dead atm.
---
Check his post history and you will know why his post is like that. To save you time, he's the kind of person who would be in a guild like that.
---
Typing /e then typing allows you to basically do custom emotes sort of. For example. /e slaps you. Would pop up in chat with the same color indicating an emote saying "Username slaps you."
---
It's not against ToS, people generally wont pay for that right mow though.  Maybe if you were 60.  Once twinks are a thing people will want it more.
---
Glad I read this far. Totally didn't see the humor flare and assumed someone had a bad experience with a bad tank. 
---
I appreciate this post a bit more now.
---
But spit already has an emote so why would you type the /e instead of just typing /spit
---
Warlocks don’t drink they eat instead. When they go mass tap they normally will eat right after. There’s no need for a healer to stop drinking and heal him.
---
I applaud this mage.
---
Exactly. Depending on how hard the mobs hit, I'll start with a shield, then swap to dw if I'm rage starved, or start dw and swap in a shield if we get extra mobs or I dip below 50%.
---
Just a simple equip macro.
---
Only time I invite without a whisper first is when someone is killed a Named quest mob and I want to get in on the kill. 99% of the time, they realize why I am doing it and are kind enough to accept the invite.
---
People. Want gold, so people try to sell gold. Supply and demand my friend.
---
Personally I'd just recommend leveling a mage and facerolling to all the gold you'd ever need, but some people don't have the time or energy for that.
---
Because targeting someone and typing /spit pops up "Username spits on OtherUsername" where as using /e makes it look like you spit on everyone around you since they'd all see the "Username spits on YOU" instead of OtherUsername.
---
sigh just do whatever it is you wish in this game. create whatever service you wish to make. stop listening to others about how to play.
---
I’m actually omw to do the same. Gnome mage Fairbanks

OH. Now I get it. Thanks for clearing that up man

---
Thank you sir. Take my upvote.
---
its in the options of the basic wow game, esc&gt;key bindings&gt;target markers
---
i personally just click it though because i can't find a good keyboard shortcut for this stuff and clicking doesn't feel slow to me
---
Thousands of us have been there if not more.
---
Yep. I think some of the BiS "common wisdom" is based on elite guilds speedrunning content, too. You don't need mana regen when bosses die in 25 seconds and you're willing to chug mana pots to reduce time spent drinking. If you're trying to set a record, a glass cannon gear set makes sense.
---
For your average raiding guild, it really doesn't matter if the boss dies in 30 seconds or 40 seconds. What slows you down is when people die and need to be rezzed, or when people need to stop and drink.
---
i mean, sure if you REALLY hate clicking. it doesn't really affect as much in PVE
---
Excellent move by the mage.
---
Just keep a lock in the instance. No need to venture above ground again.
---
idt any warriors have 1v1 or whatever. Usually grouped though. Warriors aren't always free kills if they pop CDs. Hunters are ALWAYS free though.
---
Well, spell cleaving prison just means several spellcasters clear the prison area of brd. That area just consists of the first room and the rings will cells going out from it. The quest is the Marshal Windsor questline if I am guessing correctly and it isn't a prerequisite
---
The Rock elementals I'm Badlands are decent. They drop tons of vendor trash that stacks and are worth 1-10 silver or so.
---
Can't remember exactly what level they are but around 40-43 is my guess
---
striking mh
---
crusader oh
---
This new announcement includes the ability to level 1-50 in a single expansions content.
---
That's 20-40hours to get to lvl 50 and into shadow lands assuming quests/ Time  ability to mount etc stays relatively the same.
---
So you could into new expansion content before getting to level 30 in classic.
---
We have a lock, but sadly you can't summon from outside the instance to inside. I doubt we'll be able to survive outside the instance to summon. Way too many Horde.
---
&gt; so if your thingy was set at 400ms back then
---
The thingy didnt exist back then at all.  It's an artificial lag compensation mechanic that has been implemented in classic as an attempt to emulate playing on 2004 internet and server architecture.
---
Mining in Arathi is fucking sad the amount of bots.
---
Could you link which one please? I see half a dozen perl variants and it's hard to tell which has what features

How do you get them? :O
---
I know, play what you enjoy, but know that Gnome has the advantage in both PVE and PVP over humans and even have a bonus to engineering. They are, from an objective standpoint, better than human warlocks.

No, you can actually clear that in ONE jump by avoiding the pillar and jumping over the water.

Are you new? How much time have you wasted doing it this way? My poor, poor boy.

If loot rules are set up before the raid they can’t go back on it at the end, scummy move. Sounded like it was a joint guild effort so the guild that was screwed out of loot should refuse to group with that guild

I used to make money selling white kittens it's not super profitable but it makes a little

There it is: WoW GBJ
---
Now to find out how to BLJ...
---
Isn't that one FUBAR? I was kinda hoping for it in Classic and then after reading SEVERAL reviews, it was fucked up for over a month, the creator said he was "working on it" and then you heard nothing from him until it was updated but it was still fucked. Did he somehow fix the issues with it or something?
---
I mean, have you tried playing more casually? No one is forcing you to grind DM.
---
Pretty sure PAWN does this.
---
I just downloaded it with the Twitch app, I haven't used XPerl for a month or so but I can't imagine they'd have removed it since then.
---
You can also raid as a boomkin. The results are sub par, take way more maintenance to be competitive, and require dedication to persevere through the frustration of your self made hurdles.
---
Not something I'm going to suggest as advice.
---
Shit!  This is literally the only thing in P2 I’m excited for. No more need to keep half a bag of keys.
---
Do none of you realize you can level 50-60 90% in dungeons while also getting your prebis?
---
There are only so many zones that have thorium. And if there are enough people on your server, all of them will be farmed pretty hard.

Check out the phuturprimitive remix of this song!

That was a wotlk think to combat afk in a match (mostly AV), also stops you from being able to requeue for 15 mins

Lol the 2019 PC culture meets wow classic PvP. “OmG iS tHiS bANnaBLe??”
---
I don't understand responses like this. He's not trying to find an automated botting system, he wants to play the game, but some people have to have some kind of guidance. Like myself, I can't really quest without an arrow because of my eyesight and memory make a horrible combination when gaming in Classic - I have to zoom in on maps and get up close to see specifically where to go and need some type of arrow to help me get there due to my memory fading. 
---
You could be completely joking, however there's still several people around who believe that anyone who want addons means they want the game automated, whereas if they truly wanted that they'd go play RoM or some shit.
---
Pretty sure the reason rogues are suggested lies in their chance of basically one shotting the WL through stun combo as an opener. Smart warlocks should stack stam for pvp to avoid that, but I think that's the idea.
---
Healing classes don't fare particularly well against a lock because they felhunter you and interrupt a lot of the healing.
---
If you have `variable =` anywhere in your code without `local` or `do  end`, it is global and accessible by any other code.

    -- no other code can see these two variables outside of the scope they're in

        foo = "bar"

6 weeks of MC and not a single mageblade or staff of dominance. Guild didnt run this weekend due to Blizzcon so I pugged and won the Staff of Dominance on a /roll lol. Theyre gonna be salty this coming weekend.

I never thought I'd see Classic and casual friendly in the same sentence.
---
all blizzard sees is 15 dollars running into a wall.
---
Classic is super grindy
---
You can easily level 40-60 in instances quit whining
---
That's mental.
---
Yes, there are a few variants of it. Lots of older games and MUDs, as well as chat protocols like IRC used their own commands for that type of emote and WoW incorporates most if not all of them.
---
Gotta have that cross faction alt to gank fellow faction members who are ruining your busines, right?
---
 I ENJOY YOUR CONTENT
---
Good job to that Mage!  
---
It’s like Alliance didn’t get screwed on Fairbanks when Horde decided to Raid Ironforge. It’s PvP, time to have fun.
---
Thekillertoast isn’t representing himself super well here, but let’s be real...he’s right.

I've lost it at the zoomed in missed dynamite. Great job.

What kinda cape your rockin, hero?
---
When AV comes out I'm basically going to no-life the first weekend of it to get the stuff I want from exalted and then have no reason to ever do it again. Best to do that as early as possible before getting to the higher ranks. 
---
Its only people who have never run premades with highly skilled and motivated people all on voice chat who think AV is the best for honor. The honor you can get from a proper WSG group with an especially good druid rocking flask of the titans and a bag full of limited invul and FAPs is magnitudes above what you'd average from AV, or a group that can steamroll and 5 cap AB vs pugs.
---
This subreddit is full of casuals and people who play very little, as is extremely evident by how much the "but but so few people are level 60 yet" comments are so highly upvoted. They'd probably complain about lists for premade groups and rank 14 predetermined hierarchies just like they do with item reserving.

Where is the best place to farm for Herb / mining shaman lvl 47 -50 ?

There already it. The subscription.

A lot of people used addons and guides for hyper efficient leveling routes if you’re enjoying yourself don’t worry about how long it’s taking to level.
---
/emote, /em, /e, and /me are all the same thing.
---
One of my guildies ranked on a p-server with world-pvp. He told us it almost killed the server because casuals weren't able to level or farm anymore. Considering that p-server players are already a bit more 'hardcore' than your common Bob on Classic as it takes a few more hoops to jump through if you want to play on a p-server.
---
I suspect p2 honor-farming will last 4 weeks max or Blizzard risks losing a huge chunk of casual players.
---
Might be impressed if you weren’t a mage

What did you reroll from and to?

Definitely roll tank you’ll get instant groups

You sell cats to the horde on the neutral auction house, right? I have a Paladin friend who said he makes decent gold doing this.

Well don't go to just chatting
---
Let's be honest, the kind of people that are so quick to call other people snowflakes and make fun of them for being triggered are the absolute QUICKEST to get triggered and go into attack mode themselves.
---
That doesn't conflict with what they said. The single player stuff will require OW2 which is what they claim required a new engine.
---
Nothing of that. Just do quests. As rogue you can solo a lot of them. Don't do the ninjasteal the quest item because you need the mobs exp too.  
---
Said that, search for guidelime + tactics guide.
---
It's an in game guide for horde rogues. It tells you what to do/when. It's a little buggy but I used it without problems.
---
To add to this, look up brd pickpocket farm. Probably your best gold farm once you hit 60.
---
Auto Loot setting. Questie Add On. Roll the rpg playstyle you'd enjoy most (fighter, mage, healer, ninja, or hybrid). Don't bother rushing to 60, it's more fun to try a few alts and you may be surprised and find your new favorite class.
---
Somebody posted an exchange on an alt-right forum.
---
To paraphrase, Alt-Righters: Ok, we know what we are saying, the informed left knows what we are saying, but the majority of "normies" wont.
---
I mean how many dungeons actually have group damage going out? Let the warlocks manage their own bars. Having two locks means you have two less people to heal and you can focus on healing tank or jacking off.
---
The only argument to keep your Gnomish Engineering Spec. would be the [Gadgetzan Transporter](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18986/ultrasafe-transporter-gadgetzan).
---
An item that comes to mind would be the [Gnomish MC Cap](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10726/gnomish-mind-control-cap), but that's BoE anyways. You have the important (BoP) stuff already. Maybe craft [Lil' Smoky](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11826/lil-smoky) before you reroll if you're into that stuff.
---
Mograine is about 55/45.
---
I went there and it’s great.
---
&gt; If a mage charges for food and water in group, kick them they are a bad person 
---
Actually had this happened to me once. And it's more fun to just do nothing, like, absolutely nothing to him. I'm a Priest, if the Mage doesn't give me water, it's simple, I'll just let him die.
---
Without trying to judge anyone, for it to be illegal, it probably needs to be underage, and a sexual type of picture. Not just any old pic would be illegal.

never understood the gear grind. tons of grinding same dungeon/raid for BiS only to replace a year later with a green, when you can easily do the raids with blues

I think 5 min

I have a few addons, if they help: Questie, Spy, AtlasLoot, BagnOn. 
---
I was enjoying myself for most of the leveling experience— I think part of the reason it took me so long to reach level 46 is I would just sometimes run around the map and explore. The map looked really cool to me because It’s my first time playing this type of game. 
---
Anyways, I’m not enjoying myself anymore. It’s going to be very hard to level when PvP is out in less than 2 weeks. I also feel frustrated it’s taking me so long to level when my friends do it in like 6 days of game time.
---
Are you really telling someone who had a r13 horde mage and r14 nelf feral druid, that ran several different honor groups on two servers and two different factions that I don't understand how this works? As you say dumb shit like: "after rank 11, you're running with the big dogs". 
---
You seem to be the one who understands very little. You also said there can only be one r14 a week, false. We routinely managed honor gains so that the top two players in our honor cap would get r14 the same week. It's a fucking grind. It takes a shit ton of time even when you're smashing 95% of the bg's you play with premade r10+ groups. The amount of time it takes will depend drastically on how many people follow the caps within the top tier of groups. There is always the possibility of some no lifer coming in and botting/18 hr+/daying their way to a top honor spot. Usually you can catch and blacklist them, but you can't stop them 100%. 
---
You don't have to be the most skilled player by any means, but you are so mistaken if you think you're going to casually get r13 playing a few hours a day.
---
what glaring sexism. is this bannable?
---
I know the feeling, I'm only 53 and my friends are all working on SECOND level 60s lol
---
Insert picture of a glass full of human shit with the label 'private server turd'.
---
I died with the RDR2 cut in.
---
To be fair to them, it definitely looks like the success of Classic had some effect on how they're doing this xpac
---
I still have interest it, but I'll give credit that they're trying to listen to some extent. How well they implement it is the real question
---
You’re forgetting that she burned down a tree full of night elves and their souls all went to the maw and made her strong enough to best Bolvar. They’re saying that her moves always seemed intended to bring the most death possible and it being because it makes her stronger Bc she has been in cahoots with the jailor makes sense to me. It’s a shame what happened to saurfang but the dude was old af anyway how much longer did you think would make sense to keep him around regardless of his story progression? I think their writing is brilliant if you really think about this incredibly vast world they created. I think whatever your expectations are is what is ultimately failing you.
---
I mean they could do more of a throw back
---
Imagine the prices for anything using elemental essences that you can't conveniently farm from instances. There's always people farming them in the world, so it won't take long for the gank hell to start. Soon nobody has time to farm them from all the pvp, prices skyrocketing. As if something like spell power enchant wasn't already 300g+
---
They're already rushing out classic, why wouldn't we think that?
---
6 hours a day? Talk about rookie numbers
---
it's all muscle memmory. the more you use it the more it comes automatically to you. and when it becomes automatic, your brain can think of alternative moves during fight, notice what else is happening apart from your gcds and casts, etc, and you improve as a player
---
thanks man hope it helps!
---
If leveling faster is going to make it more enjoyable, go to classicwow.live and follow that. It might take you a level or two to get fully behind it, but it's pretty efficient to say the least.
---
And they're releasing phase 2 two and a half months after release. They're already moving fast
---
*Not all baaaaaahgs are baaaaaaad
---
Seems pretty slow. 4months for bwl/aq/naxx each seems like too much.
---
No he's talking about the hearthstone keyword Rush, the one that is like charge but you can't attack heroes
---
I hope so. Id rather farm BGs then run around random zones.
---
for everyone else... there's mastercard.
---
I'm pretty sure using jump kiting it would take quite a while with no gear on for a warlock to kill the last boss. I was talking with a friend in my guild that does the warlock solo and he says its pretty tough and you basically DOT the bosses to death, which might be boring.
---
Anyways I hope this video helps some people make money in wow. I know I have fun doing jump runs, they are pretty chill.
---
&gt; most people who play classic a lot have found for the last few weeks a lack of content
---
I can guarantee you this is not the case for "most people"
---
I'm a priest, on a different server unfortunately or I'd do it for you.  I often run princess for people.  My best advice is there are almost always people farming in there.  Priest, warlock, hunter can all solo.  If I were you I'd type '/who 60 maraudon' and pm any of those classes and offer to pay them if it drops.  If they're already in there it hardly effects them but they get the extra gold.  I've had a few pm me while I'm in there and I've been more than happy to.  Id be surprised if it took you more than 1-2 pms to get a yes
---
I almost always try to heal life tapping locks as long as it's beneficial for the run.
---
A lock that spends his time bandaging/food/life drain-ing means that he's not using his optimal dps at that time and that's time wasting for the group. Healers regains mana much faster than practically any other classes in WoW, and most of the time a single Renew is enough to make a run smoother every pull or two, which has very little to no impact to the healer's overall mana/healing effectiveness.
---
Most of us have levelled alts in Vanilla and we have our own levelling routes. You mix questing with dungeons and the xp just comes.
---
Yep, people pay for that. Usually it’s 60s doing it though, as speed is the point.
---
dam bro, only flashheal, bubble, or dispell? RIP mana
---
I learned from this as well
---
A what priest?

Mograine - EU

I’ve recently started offering tank services at 20g per run. That’s 5g per party member.
---
I don’t think that’s unreasonable if I do my job properly and you get what you want?
---
They already changed the game a lot. Swapping the BG release order would be a small change.
---
This right here is what it's about
---
Im pissed i missed this now dammit
---
grats man!  good to see players of all different types out there. Keep up the good work!
---
Had this happen with a bear tank once. It was glorious.
---
I stand in Ironforge handing out free DM water and food.  I never ask for tips but don't refuse them.
---
Same for portals.  I make a lot of gold while these healers/tanks are out here sweating for every silver they make with high repair bills.  Take the Darn port for free.
---
Why? unless the healer's severely undergeared or a moron that uses the wrong spells to heal you like Flash Healing after life taps, there should be very little impact towards his/her mana during the run. If you had to life drain, eat, or cannibalize, etc. and at the same time telling your healer not to do anything, congratz, you just made your group runs slower for no reason.
---
LoL

I've never seen the lil Smoky before. Wat lvl eng do I have to be for lil smoky?

Ah the first week of classic when everyone went apeshit in hillsbrad was glorious indeed

Which dungeon would be the best to level in from 52 on ?

*cough cough* arcanite transmute *cough*

5 bucks Blizzard is going to nerf Kazzak because they don't want to deal with same faction griefing reports
---
Gnomish cloaking device, despite its name, is craftable by any kind of engineer.
---
He must have meant parachute cloak. Though I find that a waste of inventory slot on some classes like mage.
---
How is that ridiculous?
---
Gold is the least likely to change when you're questing/farming, so it's easier to remember how much gold you have at any one given time. Trying to remember how much exactly silver and copper you have is ridiculous when mobs can drop close up to a gold worth of silver and copper.
---
I am truly in awe at the story of Warcraft. I cannot count how many times the story has moved me to tears or gave me chills or filled me with anticipation. To watch it unfold over all these years feels special. So many epic characters. So many battles fought. So many places explored. Anyone who wants to trash the writers has not taken into account the vastness of this world and the brilliant creativity it took to create it.
---
Love that you took 2/5 in both dw and 2h specialization. Good old balance warrior.
---
The simplest answer is "always be leveling".
---
Buy good quality food, find some appropriate level quests, and hack into them.
---
Also if you're a rogue don't worry so much about stealthing everywhere. Go combat talents for the +hit. Use bandages if you have them. Take on mobs 2-3 levels below you.
---
You'd have to renew your Gnome Engineering Membership - over and over. 24 hours later, you'll find a [Renewal Gift Box](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11423/gnome-engineers-renewal-gift) for every time you renewed your membership in your mailbox. Keep opening them. Eventually you might find the [scematic](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11827/schematic-lil-smoky) for Lil' Smoky in it.
---
You only need 205 Engineering to learn it.
---
Ah. I didn't know there was a CD on getting the buff. Back in vanilla we had like 2 Guilds who killed ony for a long time. On my server now it's like 30 at least. Kinda makes everything a bit boring.
---
Why come to this sub, they think you don't deserve to play this game
---
Mining and lockpicking are different. You have to sacrifice the ability to use another profession if you want to be able to mine. Lockpicking is built into the rogue class, and it is expected of rogue's to have lockpicking leveled. It really isnt any different than any other class ability. To learn max rank Arcane Explosion for instance, a mage needs to level 60 (spend time) and spend gold to buy the ability. A rogue needs to spend time to level lockpicking, and usually gets paid along the way. If you went into a dungeon and some player so, "oh, I never learned that ability even though I've been 60 for 5 days /played," you be well within you're rights to call them an idiot or a noob. Lockpicking is closer to generic class abilities than it is to a primary profession like mining.
---
The variation I've heard is, "There's two hard things in computer science: cache invalidation, naming things and off-by-one errors."
---
If you want to be really tryhard go get  the addon guidelime + a guide and it will tell you the exact steps to take to get to 60. IMO dungeons are a waste of time on a rogue, they are not even that great on a mage either.
---
Ah yeah I didn't know it was a CD on getting it. In my old server there was like 2 Guilds killing onyxia for a long time. My server now has at least 30.
---
Good warlocks don't even need to life tap in MC. Pots and runes are enough!
---
It’s different from raid lock outs?
---
You dont even lose just arcane power, you lose 10% mana, presence of mind, 3% spell damage and crit chance. deep arcane is insane damage increase
---
As an Alliance playing there, I’d say that Ashbringer is definitely Alliance favored. A bit too much for my taste, even.
---
i think typically the ms/os distinction refers more to  classes who need a whole different set for a different spec, considering how effortless it is to respec from, say combat swords to daggers as a rogue. i don’t think it’s unfair to let all people who would get an upgrade to roll on a weapon if it’s for their class. it’s more like, if you’re a healing pally you’re not gonna roll on a tank weapon cause you’re likely gonna have worse overall OS tank gear, if you have any at all. meanwhile, a rogue switching to daggers would be easily just makjng daggers their new main spec just by switching one item and a couple talents.
---
people used to get temp banned for this is tbc&gt;
---
i wonder why people never realize this argument doesn't make sense. And worse, none of you even came up with it. You just heard it and repeat it like parrots.
---
If played well with engineering (reflectors) and right spec/gear, rogue hands down.
---
then that’s a bummer, but if a really good sword comes around that dagger rogue will probably want a shot at it too.
---
Idk what your at now, but I was over 14 days /played before I hit 60 and currently sitting on 21 days 15 hours on my Lock. I just did questie and dungeon spam.
---
I did a lot of random switches between zones from 40-50... then did a couple of mara runs, and a few quests. around 53 I started grinding demons for robe of the void mats and finished my grind on demons at 56... after that it was scholo runs that was super fast to level up.
---
Nice i have exactly 123g 12s 34c
---
If someone ends up here, don't use the wow interface but rather go on [battle.net](https://battle.net) in the support section, it's the same page, but your browser will handle it way better
---
you do /reload yet?
---
ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR PPPPPPPPPPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Thanks, so you never used whirlwind against single targets?
---
From my experience, you can get the one shot but it’s pretty tough unless the situation is ripe or you’re using a full pvp build - that stuff isn’t really available during leveling, and a cheap shot to 3 point kidney to even grenade and gouge ain’t enough to quite one shot. And again, if they get the fear off it’s over.   
---
But anyways - I agree that felhunter is good vs casters but that is a situational circumstance and most warlocks don’t have their felhunters out all that often. But along those lines, a warlock could have the succubus out - and then where will the the rogue be? :D. 
---
The reality is no one fairs well against the lock.
---
You can as a fury. As a tank not really.
---
reminds me of when i ran into BRM to find BRD for the first time as a level 52 mage. 60 warrior charges me, i eventually kill him. I got completely lost in there and was running along the part upstairs afterwards. 
---
he comes back with a party of 5, spam spits on me and kills me and then camped my corpse with his buddies.
---
Now you're ugly and dangerous!
---
Classic has actual BIS items, which you can get and then not worry about until the next patch. On retail your best item can always titanforge and become even better, and the difficulty gap to get the best items is even larger
---
I’ll pay more attention to what the healer is doing. I haven’t healed in classic so I’m unaware of the nuances. When i tank I try to let the healers have 80+% mana before I pull the next pack. I’ve only been playing WoW for a couple months and tanking is way more annoying than I had originally thought (I have a war too). Is 80 a good number or should I be a bit more aggressive if they aren’t having any issues? I know it mostly depends on the entire party make up
---
Still better than Vulpera
---
It depends. If you can DPS without losing enough mana to have to stop between mobs it's worth it. But usually you want to keep your mana bar pretty full in case shit goes down, so the DPS is pretty light and not significant. Anything more than light DPS actually slows you down and puts the group in danger of a wipe
---
Still id rather be a WoW here and still be alive though
---
That's what I am wondering too
---
Some classes level absurdly  fast solo, namely Mages and Hunters, and to an extent Warlocks. So you can't really compare Rogue to those three, if that's what you're referring to. Some classes also get a huge power spike after a certain level when it comes to solo leveling speed, namely Priests and Shamans.
---
Dungeon spam is technically the fastest way to level (outside of the one exception that is Mage AoE grind), but there's a huge catch to it. You do need a premade group that's constantly running it. And this catch is a huge downside, like you said, form up waiting time is a huge time waste most of the time.
---
You can follow the standard leveling path people use like in Jonas or Dugi, they work pretty well. And I've dropped Questie a long time ago for leveling, ClassicCodex is just better in my opinion. The key to leveling is to keep killing stuff, whether you're doing Dungeons, Questing, Grinding, doesn't matter, you need to keep killing things, the less downtime you have between the kills, the faster you'll get to 60.
---
Not like a fury warrior is going to change specs, he is going to keep it for pvp or sell it if it's boe. Giving people off spec gewr defeats the whole purpose of MS&gt;OS
---
i rolled a 3 on perd blade earlier
---
How much gear do you need to farm ZF gy as a 60 mage? I've watched the videos and trying to do 3 pulls. I can't even get them down at all. I go oom and die every time. I have about 5.5k Mana and 2.4k hp unbuffed. I am getting extremely discouraged because one of the main reasons I chose mage was to be able to farm gold and I can't. IDK if I'm just trash or if I am not geared enough yet.
---
As for Wyrmtalak from da alliance POV
---
1) undead rogue: 100% non bro. KOS or get KOS'ed
---
2) indead mage: 75% non bro. May or may not try to ice nova you. Mostly try
---
3) troll rogue. Dem bro. Gonna wait for you to kill mob, heal, then start fighting ya
---
3) orc warrior: da bro. May even share mining node with ya
---
100% agree on this
---
Vanilla world design was never balanced for the kind of populations we’re seeing now. The average Vanilla realm back in the day was about Judgement/Dragonfang-size.
---
This is what this whole post is about. Alternatives are disabling the addon or editing the source code.
---
If the rogue wouldn't be changing specs from different trees entirely, that's within MS&gt;OS and wouldn't matter.
---
It's more akin to a paladin needing on a 2H dps weapon when they are tanking with 1H weapons- it is off the spec they are playing
---
Took me around 12 days /played.
---
That's not really fast if u think about it.
---
288 hours is a long fucking time
---
Unnoticed Druid main reporting in :(
---
It’s a gun or nothing, bows and crossbows don’t count. The noise from the gun is so satisfying and.. loud
---
That's true, but do you really think that is not the case for fury warriors who rolled for it? You think they are going to change from dual wielding to 2H? They are not, so it's their off spec- still dps, but as dofferent as a paladin changing from 1H tanking to ret
---
If someone rolls on an MS&gt;OS gear piece, it should be something they equip literally *right then*
---
Honestly though I’m a holy priest and I know you don’t want to hear it but I’ve been healing since vanilla but actually I started playing in BC so just accept the fact that I’m gonna put renew on you and spam heal the tank until I’m out of mana. And no thanks to the mage for that shitty low lvl conjured water that I drink because I’m saving for my mount, so I don’t want to drink my expensive ass moon juice. 
---
But great post.
---
On the internet
---
Ok thanks. I hope I will be able to integrate it to with with other addons.
---
Yeah, much easier for alliance players to find opponents while farming honor. Lucky bastards.
---
I'm only 41, it's so hard for me to juggle everything irl and level, I really just want 60 so bad. What server you on bro?
---
This is the only place you’ll get comments like these for asking. The macro isn’t just 1 line of text and i was not at my pc/on the game when i asked.
---
I find that AAP bugs out the minute you do anything that's not in the guide.  It freaks out when you miss a quest or complete it out of order.
---
Thank you

---
Don’t worry fellow druid, literally no healer class is more mana efficient than us - not even pallys until they get crit gear :)
---
I don't understand players who use consumables in PvP. It feels kind of paying to win.
---
Reroll a tank to help solve the problem
---
I agree with most of that, but Diablo 4 does look pretty sick.
---
How much are you paying the healer and dps for doing their job properly?
---
Not if you are combat rogue
---
More like 50: also I hope your server warrior tanks haven't formed a union which massreports you if you start whispering them based on /who asking them to tank.
---
Ah yes so lazy of me my bad
---
I'm level 49 and there are still loads of quests to do. I've hardly done any dungeons mostly questing. Just make sure you kill every mob that you pass when doing your quests. Every bit of exp helps and you might get a rare drop of a mob.
---
You should be anyway. That way, you will have decent gear by the time you hit 60 and you will have the option to jump right into MC or have a good chance in PvP.
---
I'm level 60 and have 16g. It's going to be noticable if an 8th doesn't go missing
---
I am german and you are right. Thats exactly the meaning. We dont use "Wurst/saussage" for dick. Except you are 11-12.
---
Any decent guild isnt taking enough damage for it to matter whether all healers are full prebis and specced shadow, or all specced proporly.
---
you are delusional if you think ugoro can get you from 51 to 55 rofl even at absolute best it would take you to mid 53s.
---
also 51 is way overkill for zf.
---
i would do zf till 48-49. do felwood till 50 and then go to ugoro till 52. Once you are 52 you can start spamming arena/prison runs and make decent progress
---
Its not against ToS to sell services for gold. It would be against ToS if you did it for real money.

Do you realize you can't queue for dungeons in classic?
---
In this very situation I would agree (because he is a dick) but normally no.
---
I mean, I dont really have a dog in this race but doesnt it make sense to use a term based on its origin especially in the case that it only has use in one specific dialect?
---
Okay so I often visit Goldshire for giggles.
---
On Moonguard, I wouldn't know how this works. But on my realm, Dalaran, the AoE spit on Goldshire was herald as the ultimate "hate me move."
---
Near instantaneous whispers of varying toxicity would fill your chat box quicker than Vol'Jins ashes filled the urn.
---
&gt;So if you weren't able to nolife it to 60, now you have to deal with all the nolifers that could.
---
I understand that you don't have very much time to play at all, I imagine your /played is a couple days?  Thing is, most people are able to fit in more than 2-3 hours a week.  Normally, people who play this sort of game will play a lot more than you.  You are not the norm. You're an exception.
---
The vast majority of people who care about playing classic at all are level 60, and have been 60 for a week or two at least.  People like you - the ultra casuals - will never be ahead of the curve in a game like this, and it's unfair for you to think you should be.
---
So many quests that show the forsaken were plotting against all living things all along. Honestly, the Forsaken should’ve split from the Horde in WotLK, the wrathgate was the perfect opportunity. Then and there, the forsaken should’ve become their own faction story-wise.  
---
Too bad that like there always must be a Lich King, there always must be 2 factions with an equal number of races.
---
Cries in level 43 mage, oke maybe next year :”D
---
Rogue here. We have blade flurry, great interrupts, good cc, and I've never seen a rogue take a locked chest for himself 👍
---
if it’s a better weapon for them why would damage potential be low? also it takes hardly any time to grind out weapon skill
---
What are the Power Spikes for priests and shamans?
---
They do have much better bot detection, but the bot developers are adapting. A lot of modern bots are taking use of more advanced image recognition packages like OpenCV, as well as using an in game addon that shows certain pixels on the screen to indicate things. E.g. Red pixel at X/Y coordinates = in combat, Blue pixel at X/Y coordinates = not in combat.
---
They are also piping it through a VM or using Steam/GeForce streaming so warden will never be able to detect a third party program.
---
There's still ways to detect those type of bots, Jagex have become masters at detecting computer inputs vs human inputs. Because of the ease of pixel botting in RS they had to adapt earlier.
---
What you're gonna start seeing in the next 5-10 years is AI botting, which will get more and more human-like and eventually will be impossible to detect.
---
No R14 gear is bis for the full game afaik, so it's totally fine.
---
I'd say more an example of Ockham's razor
---
But you can't hit 60 by now if u work and got a family /s
---
Funny you should say this - I just ran LBRS with a warlock who was clever enough to bring out a felhunter to devour the frog hex off me (healer) in the shadowhunter bossfight, but not clever enough to dismiss the felhunter at the broken stair jump immediately following said boss.
---
You still can from the hunter trainer area
---
Probably not intentionally, but yes just about every mob is harder on the private servers. Bosses seem to be quite similar though. My guess is that the later bosses will be more accurate because we have more data on them. I.E the private server versions are more accurate and similar to what we will experience on Classic. 
---
One of the hardest packs in MC on the private servers are the double Firelords that spawn mini fire elementals. They spawn so fast that you need a lot of coordinated dps to keep them from overwhelming the raid. Even in BWL gear they are not trivial. On Classic however they spawn so slowly you don't even have to focus them. Stacking on Lava Surgers was always a problem, but on Classic they don't even hit the entire raid and have a huge cooldown so we don't even bother with stacking. 
---
There are (or were) also some private servers that deliberately buff bosses with more damage/HP and even new abilities but they are not considered "Blizzlike", so they aren't that well known.
---
was there a some talk about content? I only saw the trailer
---
Sometimes, if you have a power hungry pc, make sure it’s not plugged in to an extension cable of any sort, or that there  are a lot of appliances plugged in to one area. This creates minor surges in power that can effect performance of the psu. Just try running minimal components, and see if it still works.
---
Completely agree! PvP is super fun when its fair and intense but always getting ganked while having pulled multiple mobs, ganked by several players or simply someone much higher level is just pathetic.
---
I like to use camel case for half my code and snake case for the rest. I also don't comment because my code is self documenting.
---
Class names? You'd better believe that shit is all lower case.
---
I love this vintage glitch. I was so surprised and happy to see that it made it into Classic!
---
If you have enough people you definitly can!
---
The big issue is the class design is still the same. One builder, one spender skill for ALL classes. So ALL classes play the same.
---
Nope, fuck that, I'm out. The rest of the game can be shitting gold but it'll still be boring as fuck.
---
Seriously congrats dude. I’m not a father but I have a very busy job and basically I’m lucky if I can play wow 1 day a week. Currently level 37 but I’ll get to 60 eventually.
---
Yeah, I went out to eat with a friend and when I came back a few hours later to continue leveling he was back and now he was below the lift just straight up slaughtering lowbies...
---
The spell batching  mechanics feel very much like vanilla.
---
I remember getting the shock + CL double crits back then as well. It should stay at 400ms
---
Between pulls obviously, often locks lifetap to 10% hp as the healer starts drinking and then just stands there waiting.
---
Lol someone got me earlier
---
How does re-speccing work with regards to the costs of it? Do costs go down if you do not re-spec for a while?
---
Yeah, I was one of the people that switch to the main char. Killed him the last 2 times before he chose ress sickness.
---
But that’s exactly how it worked in vanilla.
---
A good warlock eats, drinks, *and* bandages. Good warlocks are one in a million, though.
---
I was about to do this but I found myself enjoying reporting them every time rather than not getting their messages.
---
We're bringing meme videos to the market now?
---
You can also use a barov peasant caller to soak sacrifices on the 2nd boss. Also the last boss if u pull him into the cave right away u dont aggro the lashers
---
Go and get your cat a PC aswell!
---
Unless you have herbalism and mining dont waste your time farming
---
I have both and it is still marginal if worth it, at half the gold/hour for just one you have to be mad to be out there
---
Although one tip for free, log out at a node and log back in every 30 mins or so. I do this while leveling my alt, amazing how often i find the node up and is really efficient farming.
---
Have you played a rogue before?
---
So what you've got is an urban dictionary article, his guild being "called out" for behavior in another game, and a google search that consists "horrigan report" because you couldn't find one actual case of him being reported. **Not one single actual source of him being reported for racism.**
---
Absolutely hilarious, you just proved yourself objectively wrong 👍
---
He must be trolling ocd people like myself. The way nothing lines up, it hurts my feelings.
---
Give me water at the start of the dungeon and I'll agree.
---
There is a way to view talents in classic? Mmm I must look into this. 
---
But also thanks for the tip to disable. 
---
Not sure if i truly care if people see my talents but maybe I will change my mind later. 
---
Still having the option to is always good.
---
I just reported bot hunter in ungoro
---
Well he is a streamer...
---
They can be replaced on a whim. No need to pay.
---
BRD
---
Oh là là, everything i commented is true tho
---
Alright Cheers. Will test it out dude ty
---
Well that's a lie.
---
I've played wow for a very long time, played only two different classes, one primarily for 15 years, and guess what, I am only just reaching 60 with 15 days played time. I've only got skinning and Herbalism as my profs, 225 fishing and 300 cooking. For whatever reason this is considered slow. I have played pretty efficiently when it comes to actually leveling, but guess what, it doesn't matter. I have enjoyed every moment leveling, interacting with others and really sad that it's coming to an end. I loved the leveling process so much. Play at your pace and just have a heck of a time. Take 50 days if you need, there is literally zero rush.
---
Really? So triggered? I wasn’t being snarky or anything mate just highlighting that there may be good reasons for not having a pot on hotkey. Chill your beans.
---
Getting boosted in SFK / SM is the easiest and fastest on an unlimited budget, but not if you actually want to play the class 😁
---
" about half the people playing daily in my guild of well over 100 are sub 50, all take the game seriously and just don't have the time to play because they are adults with a life outside of WoW to worry about. Most is still wrong. "  
---
I thought it was obvious how I could say that
---
People who know they can farm 30g an hour with ease and know that finding a tank can take a long ass time.
---
Heads up though: most people won't invite a sub-60 to Scholo/Strat/UBRS
---
As an undead mage who waits for alliance to heal up before kicking their ass, I hope you're joking.
---
May your corpse be eaten.
---
That gigantic shitstorm over your simple comment (which was said in a joking manner) really says a lot about what ppl browse this sub. It's sad how oversensitive everyone is nowadays...
---
Wow really? Sylvanas? The tricky scheming character known for conniving her way into making the Forsaken an actual geopolitical threat during the Third War? Plotting? NO.
---
How is anything else not pay to win in the game, then? Enchanting your gear? Bandages? BoEs? Profession specific things like trinkets? Reagents for spells like blind and vanish? All these things cost some kinda gold. Potions are a drop in the bucket.
---
Congrats :)
---
I thought :P meant you were joking.  :(
---
Dang this is a great pic :))
---
Who gives a shit?
---
it's certainly not optimal but as a fresh 60 mc loot will always look juicy :D
---
Which pet shall I use for leving a hunter? Did you tame something like a bear, for more tankiness or should I take a cat for dmg?
---
There is a reason for all of this folks :)
---
* Gamma is only in the morning hours since I get some kind of sunlight on the monitor which the curtains are not able to block. It's on normal settings otherwise 
---
* I honestly like my positioning because it serves my personal satisfaction :) I don't like it when the chat is at the too lower part of the screen so it's higher than the action bar actually :)
---
What is wrong with you? If you're playing an MMO don't do that shit. If you're playing solo go ahead but if others are waiting for you that's a dick move.
---
Your talents must be real shit if you need to go so far as to hide them...
---
It does look like a talent build designed to out last people instead of burst:)
---
Which is playing to the druids strenght:)
---
400 ms, same as now
---
Some body is looking for ways to troll:)
---
I like to give people’s pets underwater breathing just to be safe
---
I thought you were talking about bloodsail Buccaneers for a second and I was extremely offended. We have like 32 different 10 out of 10 molten core guilds with people constantly spamming lfg for dungeon runs
---
Oh really they changed that ? Do you have a link from the hotfix?
---
what about the possibility of being actually skilled and killing them without an elite NPC carrying you?
---
It does, same as flamestrike + coc/blastwave on novad enemies so both get the +50% shatter crit.
---
Not true, got it off a satyr in azshara.
---
Keep being bad.  Maybe you’ll find more like you and form your own guild.
---
Found a few smooth details, but don't worry, [I fixed it right up for ya!](https://imgur.com/QOkibEN)

Trouble with 'The Missing Diplomat'
---
I am at the part where you are supposed to attack ‘Tapoke Jahn’ at the inn but I think I didnt know what was going on the first time and he ‘got away’. Now I see him at the inn but he is just green and the questgiver has a greyed out ? on him.
---
Is my only option to drop this quest? And that would mean I have to start the chain all over?
---
Any ideas?
---
It's not about having shit talents it's about hybrid classes that get kicked from dungeon groups because people don't think they are able to heal or tank if they have the "wrong" spec. For example if you are shadow specced as a priest and join as a healer.
---
He was a mage and prob doesn’t even know how to play that one either.
---
Is there a conversion rate for intellect to +heal? I mean like what is better on an item, +20 int or +20 heal?
---
I like having as much int as I can but all guides say +heal is better. I don't understand that, because with int I can cast more often, be it with less output but I can still cast. With no mana all that +heal is worthless right?
---
Same situation here. I am lvl 32 :-/
---
It's just because it's a free 16 slot bag. Getting one as a drop is worth like half an hour of gold farming (depending on the price of Mooncloth bags).
---
Welcome to WoW my friend, the addiction is fueled by the never ending quest for gear and vengeance.
---
You can probably 2 man it once the hunter reaches level 60
---
I usually give my water away. I eat instead.
---
???? Is there any official info that they will just do tbc after phase 6?
---
Great contribution there m8. Evidently quite a few people do.
---
Yeah it said undead only, but it was wrong. Got mine in ubrs
---
In world pvp there is no such thing as too much revenge. If someone's been a jerk, they won't respond to acting "honourably" to them. Just obliterate them in any means necessary. Honour doesn't exist in world pvp. Literally.
---
Nonsense, got my 5 from Scarlet Workers. They're anything but undead.
---
Hello, I am an orc fury warrior. Lol first off you're a person, not a game character and that guys not a warlock. That's the class hes playing. And while I'm at it, your not a member of the horde, or allience. Those are factions in a game. That all. The sooner people can stop with this identity shit the sooner you can start appreciating the game as a whole.
---
Human hunter?
---
Cool glad to help
---
In retail: you get ganked. You log your main and get to the zone. The player is unseen due to sharding. You realise you may as well level with warmode off.
---
It's the slowest by far. 
---
Here's an example, I took my paladin in at 35 could barely do library. Couldn't tank more than a couple mobs so the runs where slow. I needed less exp to level though. got around 20k exp per hour. Took me a few hours per level.
---
Tooky my paladin into Cath at 42, had blessing of sanctuary some decent gear and a higher level consecrate. Was able to do Cath runs  in 12-13 mins (I legit walked up to the boss in Cath without clearing either of the side rooms and just let the mobs pile on top of me.) Leveled In about an hour and a half. Averaged around 50k exp per hour 
---
Now I'm doing graveyard runs in zulfurak and probably getting more than that at level 46, you see what I'm getting at here right?
---
As an undead warlock it's irritating when I'm healed when cannsbalising. Well done healer, you wasted my cool down and your mana.
---
You cant get Nexus crystals yet - raid epics give large brillant shards 2-4
---
You're best bet is to upgrade weapon every few levels. At 30 you can get ww axe.  At 37 you can get ravager.
---
Spam sm from 35-45
---
Zf from 45-52
---
Brd from 52-55
---
Lbrs/brd 55-60
---
Okay clearly you have no idea what your talking about.
---
And just talking out of your ass
---
Bolvar is the ultimate placeholder character. Whenever a king spot opens he just sits there as a placeholder.
---
Use rank 1 fn, less mana.
---
1% flat resist regardless of mob level unfortunately
---
Yeah ZF farm is sick for gold, currently funded 2 epic mounts from it
---
Is this the opening for Ocarina of Time?
---
I seem to have more time but I'm 49.
---
I did start weeks later and took a break.
---
Lol true man but I already have an epic mount and the gear is from MC soo not sure why I feel like every guy I loot Is  gonnna drop an epic
---
Petpassive is not necessary if you're using petfollow anyway. Stopattack is already included in FD
---
Alliance scum
---
Thanks! That thought crossed my mind, but WoWhead said it was added already, that's what confused me.

Notice how high in demand Greater Fire Protection potion is right now? When AQ raiding becomes available, everyone will need (not even want, but actually NEED) Greater Nature Protection Potion. So just look up what materials you need to craft those and stock up on that.
---
Oh yes eating gnomes is personal favourite
---
Do both at once, since you're after a faster clearspeed.
---
Alliance 30-40 is the worst without doubt
---
Yeah but damn these guys have been resisting my novas so I’m thinking the higher the rank the less chance they resist but I’ll try it
---
Same lol
---
I wouldn’t give any weapon to a priest considering they have their own they will most likely get.
---
&gt;as well as chat protocols like IRC
---
WoW uses (used?) the IRC-protocol for the chat-system. Probably not for bnet though
---
I don’t think there are many DKs around level 48  zones.
---
Big grats bud. Dad tanking TBD!
---
HotW most certainly scales with gear.
---
didnt know Minecraft has Felsteeds nowadays
---
Do you have a link to Luna for the 1.12 client? The only one I can find doesn't seem to work.
---
Nah its a famous pose first made popular by Frank Zane, but the tauren pose mightve contributed aswell
---
Oh boy. Some people really got a downvote boner for this one. 
---
I know people sold runs but anyone who goes out of their way to say "I sold runs" definitely didn't do it :-)
---
My approach would be to just communicate this at the start of the run. If they don't agree, either concede or find a different group. Finding a different group shouldn't be too much of an issue as tank/heal.
---
If you want them to be more likely to accept, you'll want to not compete with them. Some people will be pedantic about it, others will be more lenient, but as long as you communicate your intent and stick to it, nobody can really complain.
---
If you don't communicate anything, it will be assumed that you'll just be rolling on your current role.
---
&gt; Elemental Fire is worth ~4g20s

WSG is the best BG Blizzard ever made. I don’t know many PvPers from any era of the game that don’t love WSG.
---
But you don't even have half of your spells on your bsrs
---
world pvp will be god awful because servers can't even handle 20v20 battles. that will be  the main reason of battlegrounds being pushed early.
---
The cast bar is quartz
---
doing less damage on aoe pulls as a rogue? hmmmm
---
bagnon/bagbrother, i think has it
---
Prob ZF zombie aoe atm
---
You're gonna have a bad time in anything else other than MC. 
---
Your heals will be .5s slower and cost 15% more mana. Do your own math.
---
Trade Skill Master does this I think.
---
Our memes are dreams.
---
Stranglethorn Vietnam is not for everyone
---
I'd say that world pvp isn't automatically cancer, it just is likely to devolve into that when power gamers and honor are thrown into the mix... Though i say this as a pve server player that dislikes world pvp, i think it has its moments but in most cases world pvp is numberwise (higher level or more/less enemies) unbalanced mess.
---
It's funny because all my skill makeups look extremely similar. Interrupt always in the same spot, AoE spells always in the same spots, raid cooldown in the same spot, builder in the same spot, spender in the same spot...

---
Vanilla for EU was: DM/World bosses 3 Months, Honor 4 Months, AV/WSG 5 Months, BWL 6 Months, ZG/AB 9 Months, Dragons 10 Months, AQ 13 Months, Naxxramas 18 Months
---
Theyre maybe a little fast but not really considering bad players today are better than progress raiders back in vanilla :P
---
Deep holy is 21/30/0, as opposed to 37/14/0. The last two holy talents are making a huge difference (spiritual guidance and spiritual healing).
---
The only way to roll!
---
I did it a month ago at lvl 30ish
---
Yep, same. It's easy to play new classes at least, but damn is it a snooze-fest.
---
People thought servers would be balanced between factions, most are terrible off :P
---
it is an intended mechanic, regularly used and almost unchanged for 15 years. ( only changes were its intruduction and the raised cap to 10 on retail)
---
blizzard has nothing against it.
---
it is not an exploit.
---
:)
---
Threat meters are only a representation of what the addon think your threat is. Also it takes more threat to force a target swap than just being on top, even more if you're ranged (140% more than current enemy target I believe)
---
It's fine to walk away without understanding. It's been mentioned several times that taking all item types was not even considered. But speaking of moral high ground, at least acknowledge your hypocrisy of warrior tanks can take leather dps gear. But it's no surprise, warriors are the most popular classes.
---
i have a hard time believing you,  never saw one guy talk about talent before raiding.
---
How is artificial spellbatching to emulate the client latency interactions from vanilla wow a change?
---
I would disenchant them anyway. I think in the long run 1 Nexus will not be worth more than 2 LBS, so you win if you get more than 2.
---
Nexus crystals are not needed much except when Aq40 (enchants) and naxx (tier gear) are launched.  and by that time the market will be flooded  with them, there will be loads of obsolete epic gear to disenchant.
---
Havent opened the fire spells yet :/
---
Bold move cotton
---
Sarcasm my friend, one day you might understood it
---
Worst and most hated guild on the server goes to UC. COOL GUYS
---
Get outa here gold buyer.
---
for what?  it's bwl equivalent loot, not even as good as stuff nefarian drops.  Some might be bis for like... dps warriors and feral druids maybe
---
I was simply repeating what I read. Not sure why the downvotes for my comment - I didn't know they had changed it from Undead to anything 50+ so that's my bad as I don't have a character that's 50+.
---
Because it was a matter of principle. My post waq before bed and i didnt have the motivation to go check. Now if there was no hard cap in vanilla like there is today, and if I understood correctly, yout point is both valid and interesting. 
---
I was the one being misled because your post made it feel like there was already this hard cap in vanilla
---
No addon needed, just right click --&gt; create new chat window. Lots of ppl use this to seperate guildchat
---
Yeah, looked it up again and indeed I was wrong. They changed it and I didn't know. I was simply repeating what I read on Wowhead and was told in game as I don't have a 50+ character.
---
nope
---
Corruption as well!!
---
It does though, I've had mine crit as well.
---
It’s obviously an exploit, but it’s one that’s been around since forever. Considering how Blizzard turned a blind eye on all the ways layering was abused in Classic, I don’t think there’s anything to be worried about.
---
someone spending 300g??! must have bought gold with his dad's oil money !!
---
The problem is this time it's serverside
---
Every lock uses a  corruption and 3 curses are used per raid lol
---
The real memes are the people that think druid isn't useful in a raid.
---
thanks for that.
---
There is so much bulshit flying around that you won't believe people repeat midlessly just for the sakes of beign a knowitall.
---
THat said its a common practice, atleast where I live, to actually attach your sources for people to review. When you write an article, a wiki page, book or leave a informative comment on reddit. Just to let people know you're not pulling "facts" out of your ass.
---
you still get them in the chat, it just removes the annoying pop up in the middle of the screen
---
What is it?
---
Take a look thru OPs history. I'm not referring to just the 300g in this post.
---
Thanks, I had a working version for pservers that was slightly different and it wasn't working in v1.13 for some reason.
---
Feral tank, resto healer, rogue. I died at the enrage on the Swamp of Sorrows one due to the dragon's sleep ability but we still downed them all.
---
That explains the name of the instance. Yesterday after my pepperoni pizza I had a ragefire too.
---
Good to know, thanks pal :)
---
I top healing meters as a ele/resto hybrid shaman.  I'm not interested in having people tell me I need to go full resto.  
---
My talents are just fine.  People think otherwise because I'm able to take 16 points out of resto, and only lose 2 meaningful talent points.  The other 14 benefit a spell I cast 5% of the time by my last MC parse.
---
Deadmines?
---
I think questing addons doesnt include any dungeons.
---
Leveling add-on, tells you exactly what quests to do in a certain order and how to get to them. Pretty rigid structure. If you do things out of order I think it will get wacky.
---
Hey man, if you want to live off of shaman healers in dungeons for the rest of your life, that's your perogative. 
---
If I tell people I'm enh dps before getting an invite, I'm trying to set a expectation.
---
You can do DM:E jump runs, most people run 3 people for that as far as I heared.
---
Will they increase capacity of servers that are still layered or will we have to deal with horrendous queues?
---
For some reason we haven't had queues at all the entire weekend on Lucifron (biggest german server) and it boggles my mind.
---
In Wotlk I sold tanking services for about 50-100g a run per person. People wanted to get their daily heroic done. I wanted money for raid consumables. 
---
DPS did not have to wait for 30-60 minutes for an invite but instead got them instantly. I made some extra money from the bag and payments while doing my daylie heroic.
---
Usually I filled 1-2 spots within 10 seconds of announcing.
---
Bagnon is the one you are looking for
---
Crusader on a living root O.o
---
He got banned for using a paid levelingservice, the 900g he got mailed was borrowed from a friend! /s
---
Thanks, that must be the toxic horrors in Iron tree Woods then.
---
Sm is 28-42  zf is 42-52.
---
Wow, I wouldn't expect that kind of money for RFC. I guess he really wanted those quest rewards.
---
In the Video "Big Blue Dress", which Staff is he using (rare LBRS or Epic BoE) and what's the second and third set of armour is he wearing?
---
That’s it!
---
I'd make a few classes. I'm new aswell. I ha e 3 toons over 40 now, because I didn't like warlock, so I have a rogue main and a druid alt now.
---
Honor System, Key Rings and World Bosses
---
Imagine not scouting ahead with Rogues/Druids.
---
The long game.
---
I'm trying my hardest to get there quickly, just finding the time that's all :(
---
This. However the add-on is called prat of you're interested.  It has some nice quality of life features
---
Yeah except without the need for 20000 dice
---
Ok, so I decided to be like everyone else and switch my main from lock to rogue. (My lock is 23, so not much of a "main" bit whatever)
---
So that grind for my 40 mount. 
---
Is it really going to be 100 gold? Jesus.
---
What can I do to get the gold? Just farm mats and pickpocket?
---
Efficient questing is still, for me atleast, the fastest way to level. Dungeon spamming can be good but the group element of it makes it harder to do consistently. Just find a zone with quests your level (a level or 2 less than your level is often better for melee actually) and do em. Hinterlands was especially good for me, you can get a full level in an hour or two with the elite quests there, plus the rewards are very good. At 50ish (maybe 52?) felwood is a good option, lots of messing around running but it's all worth it for the shadow hold quests. I'd do early winterspring at the same time but don't stay there too long as the quests get hard/it's a gankfest. WPL is good too, the cauldren quests are crazy exp/hour.
---
Edit: don't skip unguro! The quests are basically just kill all the things, very efficient.
---
Soul link was so broken it was banned from (some?) duel tourneys.
---
Should average to 50-60 gold or hour. The moneymakers are vendor, essence of water and mining. Fairly rng dependent on the gold. A normal run should be around 10 minutes and then you can add lethendris every other run to avoid instance lock. Selling items can increase gold as well
---
About how long should it take to reach rank 3 in PvP? 
---
I'm considering borrowing gold from a guildie to get my epic mount now, or I wait till the 11th, do a little PvP, and save myself 100 gold.
---
nothing beats mages casting polymorph 3 times in a row while Im in catform
---
Yeah but mages farming ZF are also just playing their class. An example: Healers are not yet rare enough in dungeons. I cant make any good amount of money as a healer. As such I rarely log on on my healer nowadays. And if I am, it is either for raids, helping guildmates or running DM West.
---
Instead I'm leveling a mage for that sweet easy money.
---
I wouldn't call it "falling for" it if the end result of */spit* or */e spits on you* are the exact same.
---
Who cares, if you are good noone will check you out. Play good or use normal builds but this hiding will just give an instant kick I can already tell that.
---
I did this waiting on a boat. Turns out this dude was a guildmate, i figered late and he complained about it guild chat, getting angry at random people. He got kicked. Good emote
---
I'm gonna go with ps2. Looks about on par.
---
Lmaoo this is actually hilarious
---
It definitely happens in classic
---
I asked if they could do this and people told me that you would still be honorless if they initiate combat before it has been 30 seconds.
---
You can try. But healers are often not scarce enough. And you still need that low percent drop that is often part of a run tanks dont need.
---
An example of healers having power is when we force arena+anger runs to include golem.
---
No what he said is people who have gold that don’t want to wait. So, rich people
---
Hmm. I guess they get away with it because the line between a warrior tank item and warrior dps item can be extremely blurry. If you check bis lists for both, you'll see that a lot of the dps items are also bis or 2nd best for tanks. It's annoying, I agree, but you can't really do anything about it. Tanks need to generate threat after all.
---
As a lvl 50 alliance warrior, what is the absolute fastest way for me to lvl to 60?
---
YTA. Loot is his, he won the chest and its belongings. Forcing him to be generous and making him feel bad for putting it on the AH makes this situation only more akward. If he wanted to donate it to the rogue he would do so himself, even if he wanted to he wouldnt do it after u forced/told him to.
---
&gt;ou say that but classic brought many new players to wow. And many old players too. All that rolled new chars and ~~ran the grind to 60~~ Quit at 40. If done right this X-Pac cld take the best of classic and merge with the best of retail. Time will tell if they manage it /shrug
---
They also weren't leveling alone. Or had 7 Expansions worth of content to look at.
---
... I think you missed the point of my post.
---
All 5% of those "dedicated" players, aka unemployed wow addicts and streamers. Dont worry about the other 90% thats going to quit after getting camped non stop as soon as they finally hit 50.
---
Level 30 gear will get replaced so quickly, he won the roll the contents were his to keep. The priest can sell and buy gear that’s helpful for his build also.
---
This is terrorism.
---
The main thing is having a kickass weapon at all times. Armour doesn't matter so much in comparison.
---
Whats a good but funny RP name for a nelf druid? Forced namechange because of rp server name rules
---
Ya and that's a bold faced lie since the claim makes no sense. The claim is that they changed the look of the UI an tweaked the existing engine slightly for OW2. If the game actually ran on a seperate engine the games would be 0% compatible.
---
Afaik it only works between two people using the details addon. If you dont use details, others cant see youes.
---
Runningspeed on white lvl 1 boots and other similar stuff
---
I give a shit, u can fuck off for all I care tho
---
Very nice!!
---
&gt; anyone who goes out of their way to say "I sold runs" definitely didn't do it :-)
---
What strange logic, especially considering you’re saying it in a thread about someone joke selling dungeon runs
---
This, I only check my healers if they consistently heal on the lower end.
---
 [https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/](https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/)
---
This is the complete guild to any and all information on pets. If you're looking for the best boar, go compare their stats. There isn't too many to choose from so it shouldn't take your more than a few minutes.
---
Been doing this. Didn't know it was an exploit
---
Wow thanks for the advice, never considered doing that. This will help so much. 
---
Drinking, eating, giving you water, giving everyone hp stones and someone with rezz a soulstone,summoning 2 people to the dungeon and doing top dps consistently I expect to get at least 25% of all heals. Also plz tell me again except for just getting faster groups what you are doing exactly that is anything more than your job?
---
someone's been reading pirate server guides.
---
Looking for an addon that will make whole spell icon red when  target is out of range pls
---
The candle that burns twice as bright, burns half as long. We’re all gonna make it brah
---

---
I could see this happening.  They might even release AV and WSG before phase 3.  They seem to have forgotten the shitshow that was pre-bg honour system back in vanilla.  People were clamouring loudly on the forums for them to revert it since no one could level any more if they were over level 48 (green to 60) etc.  I remember very specifically blizz responding along the lines of “it won’t be this bad when bgs come out” and then rushing them out to fix the problem.
---
I really have no idea why people gave feedback to blizz that we should have honour implemented again without bgs for some months.  Do they think it’s gonna be tarred mill / south shore ? No it’s gonna be camped flightpoints and lowbie killing as rankers look for the most efficient way to farm honour while there are no bgs.
---
Take low levels with you for extra gold. A buddy of mine has been charging level 40+ that want free exp and no loot 4g a run
---
This sub is full of noobs that can't screen shot. It's not surprising that they think they need a 3rd party tool to practice hitting keys...
---
Wait you can also do this? This is so awesome. I will totally play a prot warrior heal shaman.
---
If I use a questing addon I usually save a dungeon+ quests for the inevitable "grind to level xx" parts of the guide.
---
Its good that my guild don't care and nobody uses cookie cutter specs but still good to know
---
One might say he did nat see that coming.
---
For all accounts, take iceblock. It is one talent point and I have seen so many mages die who hadnt had it. Ironically, these mages did too much damage and died because they took aggro.
---
Was it on pagle
---
Playing mage is really hard in classic. Might get confused by the complex rotation /s
---
A rogue never tells.
---
&gt;for a tiny output increase.
---
Yeah let's see those parses as deep frost
---
I'm not sure we're playing the same version of the game but it might be related to the setups I run with. Usually don't have a prot tank. Cannot solo heal Beast and certainly not Drakki. Maybe it's different with a prot but I imagine Drakki needing some sort of tactic for single tank so it's not really boring
---
Shit man, I need to be in the lowbie dungeon business.
---
You will not look like Zyzz in 3 years natty.  Sorry.
---
You guys are computing different things. He computed E[# Failures | 100 tries] = 100*0.01 and then pointed out that it takes 4 pulls to get 100 mobs. 
---
You computed Pr(exactly 1 failure | 25 mobs) = (25 choose 1) * 0.01*0.99^25 = 0.2 
---
And then used that probability as it’s own failure probability and computed E[ group failure ] = 1/0.2 = 5. 
---
Arguably both are wrong since you don’t care about exactly 1 failure you care about *at least 1* failure. Probability of at least one failure pr(at least one failure| 25 mobs) = 1 - (1-0.01)^25= 0.22
---
So that the expected number of pulls before *at least one* failure is 4.5 assuming that two or more failures is just as bad as one.
---
You post on Reddit almost literally every day. Calling people nerds lmao
---
Where? Where are these mysterious threads of mass reports? You allege they exist, but you can't seem to find them yourself.
---
&gt;You don't have to say the fucking n word to be racist, so idk why you think that would be some magic bullet for him being permad
---
I've never claimed any of this, great straw man though. You just have that garbage personality trait where you're physically unable to admit that you're wrong, even when proven wrong.
---
Thx for your reply, don't have any lvl 60s to help me though
---
1. There's always a 1% chance no matter what.
---
2. I've been farming for almost 2 weeks and seen about 2 Epics and 20+ Blues
---
3. It took me 2 days to get it right, have you seen Frost's Video?  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoDq2FcYXmE&amp;t=1068s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoDq2FcYXmE&amp;t=1068s) I find the Fire/Frost much more Mana Efficient and any SP you have scales much better.
---
p1: 27.08.19  
---
p2: 12.11.19  
---
p3: ??  
---
I dont know but the release pace doesnt indicate december for the next phase
---
Not for me. The only honest way of doing it is to discuss beforehand.
---
When is that?
---
What's the best droppable MH slot axe before you buy a deep woods?
---
My parrot can fly as fast in the water as a wind rider in the air. I know this because he followed me the other day from Grom Gol all the way to Booty Bay. And did not come up for air once. Wasn't even out of breath when I landed.
---
Farming elemental earth for nature resist pots is also a good idea.
---
Should not be allowed to see eachothers talents. Blizz should prevent this. Yall morons
---
The left one is Bill Belichick
---
I could very well happen but it’s far from ”obvious”.
---
[Nice incorrect opinion you have there.](https://youtu.be/BUAI6ABS3-U)
---
Yeah, you don't wanna stay low lvl too long in retail because it's fucking sad and empty.
---
I twinked (twunk 🤔) a druid back in the day and had loads of fun fighting twinked rogues and hunters and being a pretty good support for twinks on my own team, I was surprised there were no other druid twinks back then.
---
Ohh, i always thought every mage specced deep frost. But then it makes sense yeah. Though you fuckers are still taking aggro like crazy. RL has to constantly tell mages to tone down their dps.
---
What's the point of this when your spec becomes obvious just from the damage meter when people see what abilities you're using?
---
This boggles the mind
---
how so? you can just let yourself get carried no?
---
Lol, I think the Warlock is the one needing a stress ball, considering he lost 4 times in a row to a Warrior that he got the drop on.
---
Winner winner chicken dinner!!!! Congrats!!!!
---
It was always 50/50 with leaf, what are you smoking?
---
Hey. I'm looking for an addon that shows incoming heals on me and my party/raid members. I tried installing LibHealComm 4.0 but it's not working for reason. Thanks!
---
Why normally no? If you chose to stream your gameplay you can't really complain when people use that. You don't have to stream it.
---
Mages never pull aggro in my raid. We have a talent that makes us generate 30% reduced threat. It's always warlocks or warriors, but it hasnt been a problem since our tanks starting getting world buffs.
---
It is very correct.
---
So do I need to have Details! Installed for this to work?
---
Its decent for 2hand fury
---
Yeah, 20-30 minutes isn't that long if you account for it and just continue doing the thing you were already doing.
---
We have waited for you, strong warrior. Your kind is rare these days...not.
---
This is class / classic! Love it
---
Stop buying gold
---
He’s just telling you nicely that you should fuck off. Don’t be such a snowflake.
---
Good guy OP!
---
Where is this
---
While it is epic, it is in fact trash 'cause of the speed. Still, it's somewhat rare and if you like it who cares :)
---
Same feeling for me as a herbalist. 
---
But to be honest it’s just a very crowded server i think. I’m on lucifron eu, the fullest German server. 
---
The servers are just way more crowded then during the vanilla times. So many people farming stuff ...
---
This will get even worse without layering in phase 2. 
---
Any one else feeling the same way?
---
No its not, you dont get honor for corpse ganking, get your facts straight kiddo :) And honor is what this thread is about, not the sharpest tool in the shed huh?
---
/e You have been flagged as AFK. Type /AFK to remove this, or you will be kicked out of the battleground.
---
Or any variation of that. Gets 'em every time.
---
Lvl 35 with 3 year old and baby on the way. Still enjoy the game even though I'm not hardcore anymore.
---
when you were leveling up your mining i think you spent too much time on tin, did you make a new hat or something?
---
What am i looking at
---
You can do dungeons with any spec. For raids you do need a pve spec.
---
Isn't classic a retuned version of retail? Like they started with retail or legion and worked backwards instead of starting with classic code or something..
---
People are just constantly circling Winterspring and EPL for RTV. Some follow maps online as well.
---
Yeah I am done with dungeons for now and in my experience I have never ever seen people complaining about others people talents.
---
Everything has been perfected to a t. It’s not 2004 anymore.
---
Of Warcraft
---
understand\*
---
Which class does Tailoring benefit the most in late game? Like which late game Tailoring pieces are pre-BiS/close among cloth wearers. Between my main and a few alts I have such a ridiculous amount of cloth I could probably level to 300 with what I have but I was curious which class would be best for that.
---
I honestly believe they have to rush it. People on here always like to claim that it‘s the hardcore players leaving the game because they speedran through content. However, what I recently noticed is that its mostly casual players are leaving. and those make up the majority of the playerbase
---
A lot of my friends who don‘t play as much as I do started to hit 60 2-3 weeks ago. Most of them hadnt played since TBC or WotlK. Now after only 2-3 weeks on max level they‘re all leaving the game, because „mc is too easy and boring and the next raid content is too far away“. 
---
Every single hardcore player I know (and I know a lot with 35+ days /played) is still playing and at least half of them are complaining that P2 is too soon.
---
Very likely forming dungeon groups and repeatedly running them until 60. You will come out of it likely attuned in full prebis for tanking and dps too
---
You are in a group with other 4 or 39 people. Your talents are everyones business. It is a team game.
---
If your guild or dungeon party is ok with your clowny talents so be it. But some people might not be.
---
If you don't want 'stupid specs' dont invite them... or just ask them about it if you want to know. No need to go sniffing through everything.
---
You must be such a nice person in real life!
---
I thought so, I don't know. I'll get some willing participants to attempt this I guess 😂 but sure when I've used it a couple times in past to just do 2 threat meter showed minimal accruity of threat
---
This game is 15 years old , released twice ... still full of bugs ... GG EZ
---
You did it wrong, a different account has to make the character name, not your own account
---
You don't maul.  You roar/bash, save rage for regeneration.  He chooses to not fight in bear.
---
The current content is so fucking easy you cant determine how good healers are just by looking at the meters.
---
No?  I don't have 2 extra hours for farming princess or DM.  Everything else already eats up my time. So why farm if I'm happy with one spec?
---
Everyone gets to choose an item and only the people that have chosen that item get to roll on it when it drops. Regardless of spec etc though I am sure a priest choosing oeb wouldn't be allowed
---
Paying for runs implies that the guy is level 60 and geared. Only people who are desperate are gonna pay a level 40 to run a dungeon for them.
---
Where's his whine/cry post? 
---
Oh...
---
The shaman in my guild who is the closest thing to a class lead does this, he seems to do just fine. I go full resto as a shaman, allows me tank or raid heal, while he raid heals. Seems to work out plus we have 2 more restos so it isn't like we need a fourth full resto shaman. Also when we hit PvP at brm it's nice having a guy who crits lightnings at 2k and above.
---
So maybe just tell the truth and find likeminded people that will let you heal as shadow?
---
Much better than lying about it.
---
Not at all
---
For 15yrs we were told that the screen you see when you die IS the shadowlands.
---
Not purgatory waiting to be sent to the shadowlands. That swirl was never defined.
---
With the cinematic it's clear that the Shadowlands isnt a layer like a cake that creates the physical world like the emerald dream like we were told it was all these years
---
But more like a mirror that's parallel to the physical world and that swirl is the bridge/doorway
---
And this will only change when I can figure out how to heal ‘stupidity’
---
or they think: "hey, that guy doesn't have datails! installed"
---
to be fair you'll get rolled in bgs with honor farmers and consumes and premades.
---
Dont forget to '/join LookingForGroup', you can do deadmines with randoms
---
Also maybe pick up a profession if u havent already?
---
Thanks mate, that's fantastic.
---
every photo is
---
Death Knight.
---
I don't think that's a problem, in classic you just have mages casting Frostbolt for entire raids, my problem with retail is the unneeded complexity and stuff going on, what I like about classic is being able to chill out as I play, don't need to try hard and can actually relax whilst doing dungeons and such, in retail things are way more fast paced and you have to be focused all the time to do well. Don't get me wrong I like that sense of urgency and difficulty, but not all the time, I want some moments to unwind and relax, I like a bit of downtime here and there, but on retail there's all but removed downtime entirely.
---
Even though this thread is satire. I'd like to addresses some of these misconceptions/stereotypes.
---
&gt; Rogues bring no utility into the group. They keep locked chests to themselves and vanish when the group wipes to loot while everyone else is corpse running. Rogues are the only class with no baseline cleave or aoe capabilities which would make them ideal for focusing enemies but for some reason they think that skull should be killed by the rest of the group while the rogue builds combo points on a different target.
---
Rogues can (if done properly) become emergency tanks. Yes, rogue tanking is a thing, they can tank raids assuming things go smoothly. They're also great users of Goblin Jumper Cables, which I consider a utility.
---
&gt; Paladins are shit in all specs. Prot paladins can neither keep aggro nor taunt and run oom after 10 seconds in fight. Rets are a meme because they deal less dps than a holy priests shadow word: pain. Holy paladins instantly bubble and hearthstone if they feel a wipe coming and they don't exist in the first place. As a matter of fact 100% of all "holy" paladins are specced into retribution and wearing level 40 green quests reward gear with intellect.
---
Paladin Tanks can keep aggro, taunt is not a requirement and they rarely if ever go oom.
---
I'd risk wasting the one month fee and try it out
---
Is there any way to transfer gold between a horde and alliance character? If so does both need to be on a PvP server or can one be PvE?
---
Op is talking about something to do with the Shadowlands expansion and lore I guess.
---
Too bad, should have tought of that before actually joining a pvp server
---
Every dungeon I run, if we have a orc tank, that effin' shit will happen every time that cooldown is available. And then they get shocked when I let them die
---
Sorry to have to be the one to tell you this, but you picked the wrong faction - guess you'll have to start over.
---
Well... looks like me just arriving in STV is gunna be fun...
---
Rogue has A LOT of spells that don't need to be trained. You only need rank 1 kick, gouge, and others. If you are sword spec don't train dagger spells. 
---
Get a vendor price and auctioneer add-on to help sell stuff. 
---
 With certain non vendor trash items such as small flame sack, check on the ah before you sell some of the white named items. I just posted 5 small flame sacks for almost 5g.
---
 Items are starting to pick up in price.
---
I never witnessed anything like this. People must be tanking with 50 points in resto shaman or some shit if they get complaints.
---
You can post something on the shared faction AH in gadget or booty bay for a high price and have the other faction buy it. Has to be same server though.
---
Well yeah, its like 11€. Maybe it will be my best purchase in a while.
---
I think the one I had was like soulbag or something. Don't remember cuz I quit on my lock at lvl 46, just didn't like it.
---
&gt; So I’m planning on making a rogue dodge tank alt, but I can’t decide whether to pick Nelf for the extra dodge, or human for the weapon specialization.
---
Sorry for the late response, this Rogue Tank Guide should answer all question you could possibly have: https://classicwow.live/guides/836/dodge-rogue-tanking-in-vanilla-rogue-tank-guide-by-caperfin 
---
P.S. Go Human btw. And if you're curious, yes, Rogue Raid tanking is a thing. I've off-tanked 4 bosses in MC recently.
---
Mooncloth cool down is pretty valuable the cloth itself is going for 25g a piece on my server.
---
All cross faction trades have to occur through a neutral AH. Trades and transfers can not be made across server. PvP servers do not permit a single account to have characters of both factions on the same server.
---
Yeah exactly. Diablo 4 is going to have me hooked since D2 was my favorite game of all time
---
&gt; Rogues aren't tanks. I'm sure you'll find out soon enough though.
---
Yes, they are tanks. I linked a guide above your comment that goes into it in great detail.
---
Only one person seems like a tool here, and it ain't the dude you're calling one.
---
The problem with your theory is that AV isnt even available in P3, so even if there was an early BG release itd likely only be early WSG, then AB as planned when P3 drops, then AV as planned when P4 drops.
---
oh look its this same exact meme for the tenth time
---
It’s tiny in that you don’t need it to stay above most other players in the damage charts and none of the bosses require min/max specs.
---
If I had to deal with world PvP or raid aggro without ice block, I’d enjoy the game much less and die much more frequently. 
---
One of the reasons I quit Wow retail and was excited to go back to classic is because the pressure to have one spec with one specific set of gear was just a boring, unsatisfying experience.
---
I’m a little upset that I see classic start to move in that direction as well. I wish the hardcore players would just stay in retail or keep the expectations to within their guild.
---
Actually with that top DMG it's still as good as a blue, but with higher DPS. Fantastic for 2H fury because of the speed (not for ally though).
---
hOw dARe U RoLEpLaY iN a RpG
---
At least I am not hiding talents for some reason lmfao
---
Retail isn't canon in the new timeline.
---
They're the kind of people in groups that make hiding talents useful
---
I haven’t played the game before. A friend bought me a one month subscription, now I’m hooked.
---
Help.
---
There's no such restriction. A boost comes with the expansion.
---
Yeah the damage range , but not the speed right? Unless you mean slower weapons typically have higher damage range. Which is true but some exceptions I think 
---
I’m generally asking because I don’t know I’m not saying you are wrong lol
---
Level 27 here!
---
&gt; You don't have a taunt, how did you pull threat during tank swaps?
---
Rogue tanking is very much a thing [there's a whole guide](https://classicwow.live/guides/836/dodge-rogue-tanking-in-vanilla-rogue-tank-guide-by-caperfin) about it.
---
By taking a quick look at the overhealing meter also.
---
The fuck is a ravager warrior? Fury?
---
Warriors have a self buff that prevents fear. It's relatively short cool down. Your options are to use death coil for a 3 second horror, seduction works until dots are applied, and maybe the felhound can eat the fear immune buff but I haven't tried
---
50 with a 2 year old.  100% had so much more time with a new born. I can’t even shit anymore without a visitor kicking in the door to tell me “dad go potty” yup bud I’m going potty... now GTFO
---
And then you get poisoned and dismounted by that scorpid, forced to walk 60% slower for 30 seconds
---
Get some new image macros for fucks sake
---
If you spent all that group time, all that searching time, grinding mobs 1-2 levels under you, with bandages and food to reduce down time, you'd have been 60 3 weeks in even if a new player
---
I have read that I can learn gnomish Engineering from Tinkmaster Overspark in Ironforge.
---
Source: https://wow.gamepedia.com/Gnome_Engineering
---
I am Level 50 and just hit 200 Engineering, but this NPC doesn't have a quest for me. Am I doing something wrong?
---
**Edit: Just found out you get the quest from Springspindle Fizzlegear.**
---
"OOM" to a tank means 'out of mobs'. So don't say oom to a tank or they'll start pulling.
---
yeah the reason are tools that can't accept different talents other than the optimised ones
---
No this one is hilarious
---
I'd much prefer low-effort memes to screenshots of "look I just got this weapon!" or whatever other nonsense
---
Well there are a few items that got agi and strength, and some are better for the hunter others not. I guess you got those downvotes because of those items with strength which actually are useful for the hunter.
---
why would you care on a piss easy raid?
---
So its better to just lie? Instead of finding people who are okay with your spec?
---
"No matter what you figth for... you never, fight, alone!"
---
Proceeds to show Varian fighting alone.
---
Thanks man, some new rotations people have suggested has already made me like it more and so many have said to atleast get to 40 so I’ll do that for sure, thank you.
---
Lol. Sorry man but the only people upset with how much stricter chat is are douche bags. I prefer playing without being told to get cancer and die, and the same is wished upon my family. Play the game and shut your fat mouth
---
Get an Addon like TSM that shows you the expected value of disenchanting greens. There‘s no rule of thumb that applies to all items on all realms, you have to decide on a case by case basis.
---
I remember you could buy mounts with marks but can’t remember when that was. I bought a Raptor for my undead though
---
no
---
No, no you dont.
---
Absolutely. MC and Ony are easy as shit and respecing back and forth between raiding spec and pvp spec is going to cost so much fucking money.
---
They definitely want people to switch from Classic to Retail at some point. And I'm pretty sure they already succeeded at that, I'm sure a lot of players picked up Classic for the nostalgia then got bored and picked up Retail by curiosity. I know I'm one of them.
---
The weapon, Ravager.
---
You can stack buffs that affect different stats. So an agi buff (elixir of mongoose) an AP buff (firewater or juju) and a strength buff (elixir of giants or juju). You cannot stack a juju power and a firewater, as those are both AP buffs.
---
Also blasted lands buffs (Scorpok/ROIDS) are their own separate thing so you can get those on top of other buffs.
---
Ravager is a 2H that can proc to spin for 9 sec
---
I was talking about a different reward, the one related to classic players.

Ravager axe, the one that lets you spin. Which spec he was I don't know, but it wasn't protection.
---
Ravager Is a weapon drop on SM:Arm, not a spec, usually use when you need AoE as melero because it have a proc thats have a channeled whirlwind that hits EVERYTHING near you
---
meme?
---
This is the "there exist always a more vanilla" mentality tho.
---
I mean, if that's the case, what's "vanilla"?
---
A game build?
---
A concise period in time?
---
A sum of experiences?
---
Because depending on how you think, then it never existed a vanilla wow game, but just a timeframe where the same, identical game was used differently. And that's an absurd idea to follow, and extremely subjective and biased as well.
---
I do.
---
Lvl 48 a couple bars over the halfway point.
---
Total time played: 13 days, 4 hours, 29 mins, 44 secs
---
Time played this level: 0 days, **18 hours, 45 minutes, 42 secs**
---
And I prob spent about a good 36 hrs playing at lvl 30 because.. well because Hillsbrad is a BG in and of itself.
---
So you can't be doing that bad atleast not worse than me. Granted I tend to spend most of my time PKing instead of leveling and the only thing I am looking forward to is AV which is still quite a ways off. And I plan on starting the timbermaw grind at lvl 50 and that's not something I am looking forward to.
---
I do tend to grind mobs from time to time maybe for a level or so. What I do is find a cave the larger and deeper the better. and Leave the for few at the entrance  up. And just have your way with it. Move your combat log above chat and set it to show enemy everything. enemy faction comes in you'll see it in the combat reports. At 46  if you want to try the cave grinding thing. Horde I would think the murloc cave in SoS, it's deep plenty of mobs fast respawn and hardly anyone ever goes in it mobs are 41-44 i think and 1x 50 named in there plus a rare pops up from time to time. Or the Ogres just above the camp in feralas. Alliance, the Naga cave in feralas is secluded super easy kills, fast respawn and they drop loots like crazy you'll make decent money on that grind mobs are 44-47 i think. Gone there a couple times and I play horde. But prob the only horde on my server that goes there to kill alies where they least expect it.
---
That will backfire... = reputation and such (realm based)
---
I know that's probably not a Tauren skeleton, but Tauren skeletons should have been a rack of ribs and a longhorn skull like in the cartoons.
---
Literally everyone has mining right now because of Arcane Crystals being a bugged spawn. Thorium ore has over-saturated the market and dropped down to 25s, while crystals are up to 60g.    
---
     
---
Also, server capacity are 10x what vanilla servers were, there's definitely not enough veins available for everyone.   
---
    
---
There's also been discussion on veins giving the incorrect amount of taps, furthering decreasing odds of crystals.    
---
Mining is a huge gamble atm if you're not planning to use it inside of maraudon or DME Jump-runs since when phase 2 launches in 9 days, everywhere will be pvp contested 24/7 (unless you rolled pve)
---
I always see "in 15 years", and always doubt that they played 15 years ago.
---
I looked into healcomm too and it wasn't working, but I use ElvUI for frames so figured there was a conflict. Turns out ElvUI already had "heal prediction" built in, I just had to turn it on. If you use any type of unit frames check to see if it's built in already. Otherwise, I'm not sure if healcomm is expected to work with the default frames or if it needs an add-on. Finally, not every healer needs it, it just reads the combat log.
---
What is it with authoritarians and siccing the FBI on people
---
DAE not much play time?! xD
---
There is a difference between being helpful and doing something for someone that they could very easily do but don't because they just don't want to/are too lazy. If anything, I'd argue that you did the opposite of helping him because you've just compounded his outlook that someone will do things for then if he complains enough.
---
Enabler!
---
It did exist you are just misinformed. It had nothing to do with lag. Spell effects were batched for performance reasons. Now it's no longer needed, so they had to re-implement it in the new code
---
To be fair to u/vivelemarechal, I'd pay 250g if I could, for certain blue drops.  I've got about 400g and saving for my epic mount, but if I could I'd pay 250 for my beaststalker's mask because Im sick of scholo and I don't want to go there anymore.  I guess if I paid somebody that money I'd have to go with them anyways.... so maybe a moot point.
---
Healer has enough responsibility already without worrying about someone else's aggro
---
Ahhh the European way of sharing dates.
---
addons were in classic stop crying
---
Robe of the archmage is probably the best. priest and warlock also make good pieces, but archmage is bis for the longest.
---
He's doing God's working by teaching bad tanks.
---
Meh, druid is the best 5 man class in vanilla. Its a joke post :D
---
I kinda like it
---
Dude it's a wow macro
---
Gotta admit, that guy's got a very original name.
---
Bagnon, if u dont like Bagnon there is Armory, if you want more comprehensive for AH, Mailing and Automizing Mailing ETC u got TSM. (Trade Skill Master)
---
Weapon normalization: for regular white hits, damage is calculated as (weapon dps + attack power dps) x weapon swing speed.
---
Instant attacks are calculated as: weapon dps x weapon speed + attack power dps x weapon TYPE factor.
---
For 2h weapons, the factor is something like 3.8
---
This is all moot, because OP is a Paladin with no instant attacks unless he has something like HoJ trinket.
---
So even worse.
---
It took me days to get hoj and i mean /played days. Noway someone is gonna do that for 250g
---
Raid gear is better than pvp gear for rogues unless you make it to rank 14.    
---
You won't be rank 14.

Did you really find blues and epics on zombies ?

This. I have a 9-6 Job (+occasional over hours), with an 45min - 1 hour commute each way, considering that I get out of bed at 7, that is 12h occupied, count in 6-7h sleep that is 19h. When I get home I spend at least 2h with my girlfriend, have dinner, chat, etc. 21h. I play guitar and play around with synthesizers for an hour 22h. That leaves me maybe 2-3h a day for wow. Of course I can’t do that everyday as I meet up with friends, jam sessions, social activities etc. during the week.
---
Weekends are usually for the outdoors, hiking trips, friends, family, cinema. I consider my life relatively boring and average and probably similar to anyone with a partner, a social life, and another hobby beside wow. No Idea how people manage to hit 60 after a few weeks, a month, and to be honest even 2 months. But hey, whatever. What I don’t get is those people being toxic towards other people because that don’t dedicate their whole free time to a computer game.
---
Why not? It was Quickheal. 
---
On the private server scene you can macro all healing choices on one button and just spam it throughout the fight.
---
It was one of the reasons the 1.12 macro system was never even discussed for Classic WoW.
---
It took me days to get hoj and i mean /played days. Noway someone is gonna do that for 300g
---
Completely new to WoW, loving my undead rogue on ZT eu! I’ve reached level 10 and the subtlety tree seemed really cool. I put a point in being able to sneak around better, and somebody told me it’s a huge mistake. Even though I’m super enjoying my time, it made me feel kinda bad. Did I go totally wrong here? I saw the move faster in stealth talent and just wanted to reach that... :(
---
Didnt get a single one so lame
---
A friend in my guild was complaining about the same thing lastnight.
---
Arcane crystals being a bugged spawn? Please explain.
---
*laughs in balance druid*
---
Perhaps, I've just found my experience with classic to be very unlike how many others describe it, though I realize it's mainly due to how -I- played it. I do really like it, and things like --- co-operation, gold having real value, most content being worthwhile, meaningful professions, distinct class feelings are all features that are inherient and undenyable.
---
Though things like raid difficulty, the general attitude towards leveling being a sprint, the accumilation of knowledge... All resulting in a game far more similar to retail than I would've expected, at least in player mentality. Though, in my guild at least, the more vanilla-feeling is quite overwhelming.
---
And yeah, all of this is highly subjective.
---
Correct, Details! Comes with a system that allows two Details! users to inspect each other. This tool helps you modify Details! to send whatever talents you’d prefer everyone to see
---
Sky butthole
---
To the Horde the Alliance are red.
---
you'll still want a blackstone for pvp. double tarnish for pve
---
So is it possible that it doesn’t work cause I transferred to this server? I literally just tried this with deleting and it didn’t work.
---
They couldn't start with classic coding because for all those years they weren't archiving it, just basically pasting over it. This is why two or three years ago I read an article by some dev saying Classic probably would never happen because of recreating the original without the original.
---
It matters for some things, like whether she should use Seal of Righteousness or Seal of Command.
---
For overall dps, speed matters little.
---
Sure fuckin is!
---
You’re not getting downvoted due to lack of education you’re getting downvoted because you are equally wrong. You don’t care about exactly one failure you care about at least one failure. The correct answer is 4.5. See my post.
---
Not at all, you’re going to either spend 48-60 in an instance, or you’re going to quit the game
---
Sounds nooby
---
Will you people shut up about rotations? Game is an RPG. Go and play a shooter or an action game if you want to mash 5 buttons a second.
---
he's probably a troll hunter
---
What is spellbatching and how are things different now (beyond numbers)?
---
Why doubt it? There are lots of us that played 15 years ago and are playing now.
---
Ya got me.  Time to blast off back to my homeworld.  Goodbye humans and thanks for hotdogs, your crowning technological achievement that will save my people.
---
Oh yeah and go 2 money making professions! Either skinning &amp; mining, or herbalism &amp; enchanting, whatever you fancy! But make them both gathering professions to make them fat stacks.
---
I also like doing one around christmas, build a campfire near the start area of BG, and write "The Spirit of Winter Veil has given you a fire to warm up by, type /camp to receive an upgraded campfire buff" and watch people afk out as /camp gave the same afk designation lol.
---
If they all quit at 40 the classic realms would be dead - they aren't.   Do a /who for any zone on your realm at peak time.  Classic is thriving currently with ppl of all levels.  Take the elements that make classic great, add the new content and qol stuff and you have the potential to make wow great again.
---
Why are healers so spiteful? Like if you can heal just heal. It only takes 30 seconds to get your mana back. Also if this happens to you so much just say something to them lol 
---
E: Can't comment anything that goes against the circle jerk without being downvoted
---
I clear with my guild MC under two hours but that's beside the point. Unlike you at least I don't put myself on a pedestral just because I disagree with someone.
---
Overtuned means harder, by the way.
---
If you played any of the popular private servers you would know that’s true, too. UBRS, MC, Onyxia, all had more punishing mobs and mechanics than classic 1.13. Never mind the countless dungeon differences that were harder on private, like the deadmines goblin foundry.
---
I can give several examples. UBRS rend event, had more mobs per wave, more dangerous mobs (the AOE flamekins that could wreck your raid), more frequent ability use (the whelps would spam lightning bolt) all adding up to an actually engaging event that you needed to strategise for. Your raid is taking massive damage, you need to split up/cc the aoe mobs and focus the whelps or you will wipe in seconds. I wiped many times on pserver rend. Now it’s an unfailable snoozefest that you can 5 man. 
---
MC - flame imps and garr add explosions do less damage.
---
Onyxia - more frequent deep breaths. Phase 2 fireballs did a large AoE stun/conflagrate effect that was one of the most dangerous and deadly mechanics in the raid. 
---
I’ve killed Onyxia every lockout since mid September and still haven’t seen anything close to a wipe on classic. 
---
If you have examples as to how classic is harder though, instead of dismissive ignorant shit like “ezmode baby server” I’d love to hear them. But I doubt you do, since you clearly have no idea what you’re talking about. Anyone who’s played both can attest that classic is easier, I’ve spoken to many people who’ve noticed the exact same thing.
---
Get a guild with helpful people. Mostly not a raid focused guild ;)
---
yeah, and having rose-tinted glasses memories is a thing. it's not absolute of course, but memories will always be spotty.
---
As i ever say, the true test any MMO has to confront with beyond the ideas it exposes on paper is the test of time. Classic gear grind isn't that much different in spirit from retail, it has just the variance ( and i have to say a welcome one ) of having a wide arrangements of consumables and having the raids being quite easy, so gear becomes more of a comfort that does not make you spend money on pots and flask every time rather an integral part of your build.
---
I mean, duh, i have even never used an enchant and used only fire res pots as consumables and i have cleared MC with only 1 epic on me, with the mass majority of others not being that well put as well except tanks, and we almost one-phased ragnaros on first try.
---
Hey I would highly recomment killing them with coc, flamestrike and arcane explosion... dont use blizzard. That way if something resists it doesnt matter. There is a video on youtube called 50g/30min mage zf or something explaining it.
---
Tl;dw: you have to kite them in a big circle while walking on them to stack them on a point
---
if you're on a pvp server, get herbing, the low lvl herbs like swiftthistle, stranglekelp, briarthorn, fadeleaf, grave moss are worth alot     
---
And get skinning and just vendor all the skins you loot
---
If youre not gonna get healed anyway, may as well go hard.
---
It’s beautiful :’)
---
Accurate..
---
I don't understand the obssession with this timed release schedule. More content we know to be good is better than less. I want to do ZG and AQ20 between MC raids again. There's 2 major things to do on my char at once and that's shit.
---
Ugh my two favorite things
---
It is?
---
#HUH!
---
they have more free time to check reddit while they corpse run.
---
I’ve even offered to pay up to 15g for a tank for the chances of one item. I’m also in several epics already but an upgrades an upgrade until I get my t1 chest.
---
Nope you'll be fine. Subtlety tends to be more of a PvP tree whereas combat is seen as the pve tree. Combat is definitely favored as the go-to levelling tree thanks to blade flurry but I've been levelling with subtlety and it's pretty fun. Definitely has more of a rogue feel to it
---
Because if you lose more than half your mana Halfway through a fight then you’re useless.
---
The best way to have good tanks that don't do shit is to punish them when they do shit so they stop doing it
---
Luci will have 10k Queues again with layering removed :(
---
You don't have to always cold snap when one or two resist your nova. If they resist your nova then you can tank the one that resists and cold of cold them on cool down. Coc them and then kite around them until nova is back  up. That is what I do when they resist. Never have to really use cold snap unless you are on your third pull since the ten minute timer should reset by the time you reset the instance.
---
Nah if he properly did steroids and did tests beforehand to figure out he had a heart condition then he’d be alive. Steroids expand your heart and increase red blood cell count raising your Bp. Also, if he didn’t do them he’d be alive.
---
Sure in like a raid situation, but I think hes talking about dungeons
---
Healbot was for noobs.
---
Exactly, imagine playing the best dueling class in the game, just to wield a sword and melee hit. It's so much satisfying getting that massive ambush crit on a cloth wearer and watching them suffer
---
Mutilate was one of my favourite changes for assass, I just don't know how viable assass is in classic
---
What is CoD? How does it work?
---
Lock dots are scary. 3 dots on me did 3.3k and I’m only sitting at 3.6k. If that dude got one shadow bolt off I’d be dead.
---
Even in dungeons, have you healed a sm run with literally 4 other warriors all with ravager all orc. Shit was dumb, couldn’t tell you how many waters I went through
---
I heal raids as HOTW. I just don't tell anyone haha
---
It's amazing seeing the retail and classic reactions side-by-side.
---
ShadowedUF is my go-to. Super clean.
---
What makes you say that? What changes at lvl 52, are there no quests anymore? No mobs to grind?
---
(I'm being facetious here, I think you may be applying the [typical mind fallacy](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Typical_mind_fallacy), and thinking everyone else is thinking/playing the same way you do.)
---
Gotta admit you get the bad with the good though. Runs are a lot faster more experience more drops. It’s just really ALOT when you heal an orc warrior sometimes.
---
Weiner Dungeon
---
If one resists just put up ur ice barrier and tank the one while you blizzard the others then re group them. Very easy to recover from a resist.
---
Depends on what the „actual game“ is for you. I for one always found the leveling phase way more fun than end game content.
---
Yea but 2h fury is not that decent on alliance compared with dw
---
Real life for me. Our guild leader knows everyone in the guild personally right now. That helps not create a toxic atmosphere. Of course it also means we're not big enough to fill an entire raid with just the guild, but I'd much rather have a good time with them and some pugs where any toxicity is with people you'll likely never see again than to be in a guild that can raid consistently but is permanently toxic.
---
Ok, I have to ask. What is world chat that you typed into?
---
I have no idea where this nonsense comes from. By this logic, there's no point playing the game if you haven't had an account on day 0.
---
Yeah I had someone inspect me in IF, see that I was in mostly MC stuff, then whisper me asking to come to strath. I'm like sure I guess I still need some stuff from there... haha nope. Everything worth taking was reserved. I said I'm not running with people who reserve the entire dungeon and got "you're a DPS you should take what you can get". Yes.. after asking for my help, I should be grateful to go along and get nothing for it apparently? 
---
Like.. I can run as many dungeons with friends/guildies as I please. Or form groups from LFG and the list of tanks I have on my friends list. For all the "I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE COMMUNITY PART OF CLASSIC" stuff I swear some people completely forgot that you actually need to put some effort in and become part of one. Do that, you'll never need to pay for a tank as you'll have tons you can get.
---
To be clear.. if tanks want to sell their time to people? Go for it. But it's baffling to me that anybody would ever need to. If you're a good DPS who lets tanks get aggro, uses CC, attacks the skull, and uses utility to help instead of "OMG DPS METRES!!!"? You soon find yourself having tanks ask to put you on their friends list... cause turns out while DPS is super replaceable, good DPS that don't make instances a living hell for the tank is a lot harder to find.
---
Same. And now I'm sitting at 52 with a little over a week before becoming Lvl 60 snack.
---
Weapon speed matters for paladin Soc
---
The thing about Live strat is par from 1 pair of shoulders from a boss before you even get to live, theres nothing out of that side (Plate wise) except orbs for crusader.
---
If you don’t farm dungeons in aoe cleaves ww&gt;ravager
---
I doubt all guilds are bleeding edge no-lifes who play 5+ hrs a day.
---
is there a french-speaking guild in Dreadmist? I'm not a hardcore player or demand something from the guild, I just wanna see some french dialogues in chat - in order to not forget my vocabulary.  
---
edit: my in-game name is the same with my reddit username, so if there's any please whisper me.
---
So the word “honorable kill” means nothing to you?
---
Well DM has literally nothing to do wit phases. It’s just another dungeon. BG’s change a lot more.
---
I liked the original AV best.  It felt like an actual war effort, where objectives mattered.
---
When you won, it felt more like accomplishing something.
---
Idk man, but the horde that do post here love to bitch and moan thats 100% for sure.
---
Mara last night.  Warrior charges.
---
Me:  GL guys!
---
Don't know why people bother to complain, just don't run with those tanks and leave them to run with those who don't care about the orbs. 
---
Long as they're up front about it people can put any conditions on a run they want. That way you can decide for yourself and either go or find another group.

He got perma'd ; then he decided to create a new account and use the 
---
same
---
exact
---
fucking
---
names
---
For everything. He was able to play classic for 3 months with all the same level of drama around him and it still took this tweet to get him perma banned when blizzard could and should have banned him under their TOS   
---
he wasn't "just reported" for this when other people in the grob discord / sub say they've been reporting him because he and his entire guild abused the auto reporting features to get guild names changed.
---
How come people wont let me tank raids on my druid?   I MT rag, but that's it.  Meanwhile, the dumbass MT spec'd that trash DW fury prot build for threat, and gets 1 shotted by golemagg.  I could generate more threat, and take half the damage.  Shit's dumb...
---
Haven’t seen brut blade/perds drop yet but I’ve seen a million CHT’s.
---
That's an idea
---
When they clog up trade and lfg for hours day in day out, people are allowed to  complain.  They obviously aren't running the instance with them. 
---
People are allowed to set conditions in public chat, but people are allowed to call them out on it in public chat.
---
That's true!
---
tyler1 is absolutely insufferable
---
&gt; Tanking is not popular and it also takes more effort than DPS, at the very least.
---
This always amuses me.. like I have a tank. I have a DPS. I've been playing for the last 15 years and both roles are pretty much equal to play well. DPS certainly has a much higher tolerance for bad players though.. you feel a bad tank way more than a bad DPS. 
---
But personally I'd rank doing both jobs properly about the same. Healing I've honestly never gelled with myself.. I'm just not good at it for whatever reason even though my healer friends find that fact highly amusing.
---
it's not entitled, its a general rule of etiquette at this point to not fucking pop blood fury if you're tanking in any capacity
---
My cat does this too! Though he has claws and im scared he will scratch my screen
---
Theres a rtv spot in tyrs hand and while i farmed the elites there someone was checking it every 3-4minutes
---
I also played OSRS as a 1900 total ironman. Love that game. 
---
 I watched the classic launch and watched streamer for a week and a half before doing research on classes and finally buying the game. 
---
Needless to say I haven't played OSRS in over 1.5months. 
---
 I will go back sometime, but at the moment I'm addicted to this game. I definitely recommend this for sure. Try a PVE or RP server first and dabble around on a couple different classes to get a feel. And definitely download some add-ons from twitch.  Just Google which add-ons you should get.
---
Yeah, but they released classic with better talents and gear. MC is cleared by any guild ever and is basically trivial to do for even fresh lvl 60s.
---
And BWL will be basically be the same because of the buffed gear.
---
Low quality bait.
---
Do you heal them if they survive until the buff/debuff wears off?
---
I played runescape for years, and always wanted to play wow - but could never afford the subscription. I eventually got to play some private servers during Wrath of the Lich King, but only ran my character to to 45. 
---
Still to this day, runescape has a special place in my heart; but wow was exactly the step up I had hoped it to be. I'd say give it a month and see for yourself!
---
https://imgur.com/ehgpIvm.jpg
---
Thats rough, its common on our server to acknowledge that without that first orb to tank or healer you might not be able to form a group because of the loot that drops.
---
Nah. That's just the best way to Not Have Tanks.
---
It’s a very average FPS game with RNG loot boxes
---
Flex.
---
Great thing is that you can just do jumpruns in DME and get 2-3 Rich Thorium Veins per run.
---
Genuine question because I love PWS and Disc. Is a Shield still applied 100%?
---
Lol you got me haha
---
Someone else also said that RP servers are good to start with so I'm gonna go with that!
---
This should just be a subreddit meme honestly. Regular ass default meme pictures with captions and only edit to pic to make it wow related is pasted on shoulder pads that might not even fit on the picture properly
---
Not healing is about survival? Idk if you know how this works.
---
What is threat anyway? Does more damage mean more threat?
---
I don’t mind people taking money for tanking if they don’t actually need stuff from the dungeon.
---
If some guy still in green only wants to run specific dungeons where he needs gear and also wants money for it, then that is just dumb.
---
We play more like 8 hours a day

Subtlety is super fun to play, even while leveling. We play this game to have fun so why care about what someone else say? :) You can always respec to something else down the line if you feel like it. Have fun!
---
53 with a 2 mother! Yup that's right she came the same day wow came lol
---
go dagger rogue 99% of mages you fight will be bad anyways and you can just ambush vanish ambush them and probably kill them if you get them while they're fighting a mob or something
---
It gets worse still. In German-speaking WoW, twink simply refers to any character other than your main, so it's near inevitable you will learn this meaning.
---
It's very difficult to break the habit.
---
yeah you absolutely could frost bolt and then immediatly use an instant like CoC or fireblast and both get the benefit from shatter. Spell batching has issues but this was 100 % possible in vanilla.

I'm not sure why you would ever click and choose dismiss, when you can just have a simple keybind on your action bar.

Drinking after is fine, if the tank let's you drink. That's not always the case.

Dinged and cleared rag week 2 got almost full bis and I still think it's way too fast.
---
I hate people who insist on whining about that stuff in trade/LFG and creating massive discussions which *actually* clog up the feed cause I can't block all of the people whining about it, then all of the people telling you to shut up, and so on.

Just ignore and move on. Why do you care what they're doing?
---
I have been using a similar emote for years and I love it when a mouth breather falls for it.

Gotta tell strangers on the internet about this irrelevant achievement because THE WIFE isn't approving of it.

I do it all the time. All unneeded blues and greens go to the tank. That way I can form.my own party and don't need to have competition for items I need.

I must go- my people need me

\&gt;  After confirming that the guild name should be back to normal and citing a "careful investigation of your account warning," the unnamed moderator made clear that this kind of automatic takedown may very well happen again: "There isn't a way to stop people from reporting this name, as some find the way the term is used offensive. If you get actioned again, you can appeal like this, and we can look at it once more. For now, though, you have your guild name back!"   
---
Grow the fuck up you troll.
---
I agree to a degree but I think there is a difference to enjoying a PvP experience compared to being corpse camped by someone vastly higher lvl than you.
---
And often, in large packs, procs off itself.
---
Ravager cleave runs are the bomb.
---
Of course.

&amp; now you deleted your other comment in shame, so I'll reply here 😂

First of all: Calm down.

Secondly: Find me **evidence** of racism from Horrigan that dates back to August, should be easy right?

inb4 excuses because you failed to find it because it doesn't exist, your cycle of anger, ignorance &amp; disinformation continues.

warrior tanks need on dps gear thats for rogues and hunters, the 2 worst dungeon classes. Nothing really to do thats just how the game is played, otherwise they can't gear up, there's actually too many warriors in full leather gear that can't tank 60 dungeons. 
---
But as prot/holypaladin the amount of items that you can need on as main spec is so big that it's not really worth it to try and take both prot and holy items. We gear up so fast that passing on those bis offspec stuff isn't that bad like it is for others.
---
Or you can do like me and win Magma Tempered Boots vs another paladin while wearing Deathbone Sabatons xD
---
Why? I'm pretty sure the average age for classic wow has to be like 26+

It's not that you're going against the circlejerk, you're ignoring basic mana usage principles.
---
Basically, there are only so many heals in a fight. If you heal somebody that literally can't be healed fast enough to keep them alive, then you're choosing between them dying after you've wasted most of your mana on them (the rest of the team will be low because you were focusing on tank) or them dying straight away while you wasted no mana on them (and DPS will have health).
---
So either you have a dead tank, full mana and healthy DPS or a dead tank, no mana and low health DPS.
---
It's not just a case of ''if you can heal then should should heal'' because that ignores the fundamental principle that you need to monitor as a healer: mana management.

My general understanding of Hemo in raids is that it scales poorly. So while it might be nice for early raiding in a melee heavy group, it loses value rather quickly.
---
The DPS loss of the single Hemo Rogue will eventually outweigh the gains of the other melee in your raid.
---
Not to mention the whole limited debuffs thing. That's an entirely different subject and completely dependent on your raid composition. But it is a large factor. Rogue DPS is valuable without taking any debuff slots.
---
That being said, play how you want... If your raid leader doesn't mind, go to town.

Not healing someone who will OOM me because of a buff they themselves use, when I can focus on healing the dps'ers and make sure the group survives, is about survival.
---
Tell your paladin friend to do his fucking job and give salvation to everybody. 5 people in the party and only 2 have both blessings on them. He didn't even bother buffing you.

I think a lot of people are like myself in that while classic is fun it has a known limited progression, where as retail has unknown new stuff to explore in the upcoming raid, but also the expac. I personally think shadowlands looks sick and it makes me lose interest in spending time on classic when I could be doing nzoth stuff to get ready for shadowlands
---
People who play on a PVE server won’t have anything to do for 2 phases so they have a lot of time to post on Reddit.

&gt;Rogues are the only class with no baseline cleave or aoe capabilities which would make them ideal for focusing enemies but for some reason they think that skull should be killed by the rest of the group while the rogue builds combo points on a different target. 
---
lmao this is actually true a lot of the time. we don't focus skull sometimes because our damage ramps up, so if the target dies too fast we don't do as much dps as we could
---
your cat is my cat
---
/e has reported %t for being AFK.
---
Bartender
---
This is exactly what macros are for!
---
&gt; Why are healers so spiteful?
---
Because sometimes the other players are playing against you, that is not fun.
---
bad tanks as healers feels more like a PVP between the tank and you, when you do something to make it easier on yourself, he does something to make it harder. And yet you still have to help him.
---
Healers get spiteful when they have the complete overview of every mistake the rest does while they are hostile to change it. Letting people die means they have to pay repair and it slows their leveling, which can often teach them.
---
Letting them die can make them better players, it's not something i do often. But every once in a while it is needed. Especially if they don't communicate
---
One of the shaman in my guild just got it and loves it. Not sure I'd call it garbage. You should put crusader on that bad boy
---
It should be, but don't make a habit of shielding tanks, prevents rage generation from getting hit, so they have a hard time getting aggro.
---
I hope so. If I see the tank pop this CD, I apply shield and cross my fingers.  Cause I’m not going to let 50% of my mana get wasted.
---
Undead rogues are the ugliest
---
Best time to start selling free action pots and iron grenades off?

A Bow of Searing Arrows dropped for me last week, and 2 or 3 blue BoEs since I started, so yeah it’s possible.

---
What... I’ve have yet to see one even drop...
---
This sub is both very casual and very toxic. Its honestly insane how my ingame experience was amazing and reading this sub is just awful.
---
You are the exact person that this macro would work on.
---
Never once had anyone ask to inspect talents before raids or instances. Why are you so paranoid?
---
How about just being a normal human being?
---
Typing "hey please dont do that and only use it when you wont be taking much damage" is not that hard.
---
If you don't have good questing routes or a dungeon team grinding is a very good option for exp. Just find a spot where you have plenty of mobs 1-2 levels below you that doesn't have any annoying debuffs or spells and grind away
---
But then you can’t skip everyone else right? Or can he just stay right in the beginning of the dungeon?
---
From what I've seen, its more never procs on AoE but procs constantly on single target :(
---
You got it. The problem is that it's a simple radio button between sending money or requesting CoD. The values are entered into the same boxes for both. So you have to make sure you have CoD selected or you send them the amount you think you're requesting for CoD payment.
---
I think now when sending money there's a confirmation pop-up but even that didn't exist in early vanilla if I recall correctly. And most people just blindly click confirmation dialogs anyway. You have to be somewhat aware of the problem for the dialog to really resonate with your brain and trigger the "oh shit, I'm an idiot" response.
---
That's my secret cap...
---
I'm always hard
---
I see a door marked private, Charlie.
---
Hes right. Pally tanks limit dps by a large amount.
---
indeed Noggenfogger
---
Horde is to busy actually playing to be braggarts on here.
---
The graveyard lol
---
If you have Details installed, everyone can check your talents without asking.
---
I forgot there was even a dismiss option in that menu. I've had it on my bar since level 10
---
I’d say deep resto is only needed in raids. Just go with 31/0/rest imo. You can heal dungeons just fine with intellect and spell dmg gear. Deep resto is horrible in PvP too.
---
😅😅🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
I feel like batching is mostly okay when it comes to offensive spells but could be tuned down a bit when it comes to other things like auras, heals, and most importantly kicks and fakecasting. Right now if you kick halfcast the spell still goes off like 1 second later. And sometimes you fakecast, get kicked 1 sec later and you're locked... All your casted spells and heals can also be canceled before the cast is complete and still go off. 
---
Also, unrelated but some items are not working as they should be. Discombobulator not dismounting? Come on, that worked even in TBC. And Mortar and Magic Dust shouldnt be instant casts I believe, although I can't say for sure how it was in 1.12.1
---
Just keep doing quests. Every breadcrumb quest that sends you across the world takes some time but usually opens some chain.
---
I leveled sub all the way to 60. Try'd combat and swords but it's just to boring. It's less good in Pve but alot more fun PvP.

Shaman, wf proc can delete casters pretty fast

You can get living essence from those packs and also if you go too fast you might hit instance reset limit anyways.
---
Tank : Charges in
---
Mages before any sunders : So anyway, I started blasting
---
And when they don't listen to you? 
---
You're responding as if I'd never heal the tank. This discussion is about a racial for orcs, that when popped, gives the orc -50 healing received. If you as a tank use that, you're the problem.
---
Don't blame us for you have the city equivalent of the death star exhaust vent
---
Have a 60 horde on herod and now I'm playing alliance on skeram
---
Why do you think pvp doesn’t happen on pve servers?
---
Imagine caring about specs for piss easy content that can be cleared by 58s in greens.
---
I want to say you need the "king" buff to loot the chest and you have to talk to an ogre at the end of the dungeon to get it. I don't think there's a feasible way of selling tribute loot to non-stealth classes or other hunters.
---
What does questing have to do with farming gold in ZF?
---
There's really no such thing as "a huge mistake" at that level.  A huge mistake is choosing the wrong quest reward when you turn in Onyxia's head (Onyxia is a raid boss that drops 1 head per raid, starts a quest with epic rewards to choose from).  Placing a few points in less than optimal talents while leveling is at most a minor annoyance.
---
That’s exactly what he’s saying... cause els shamans stink... lol
---
Reddit is generally populated with carebear handholders, same as alliance!! :(
---
Get DDU, uninstall your current video driver completely and then install the latest.
---
Get something like MSI Afterburner and DOWN clock your GPU,  and you could even try doing the same with your CPU if that doesn't work.
---
Its not "easy". Its free lot extremely easy. There is not a single progress guild.
---
I think it’s 3.4 for two handers.  That’s why super slow weapons (such as arcanite reaper) ended up getting slightly nerfed when the normalization went live.
---
Remind me, which one of us is crying about phase 2?
---
I just want to say; dont read too many guides! Dont depend on friends or addons. 
---
Go out into the world, meet with strangers, talk to them about these things and learn them in-game.
---
In wow you cant really do much wrong other than wasting talent points or wasting money.
---
Enjoy the game from within the game. Make friends and do content with people from your level.

"it's easy for me therefor it is easy for everyone"

Nice narcissism.
---
It's just something these guys say like it's the easiest thing in the world.
---
By their logic you will only live (like actualy just logging in and out at the dungeon and spamming LFG for groups) in BRD from 52-58 then switch to any other high level dungeon until 60.
---
Because that's very fun and engaging gameplay and you also get your gear for when you're 60! Hooray!
---
They're decked out in their BiS gear waiting to pounce on the lowbies while lecturing them how and where they should play because you're just a walking free kill for them.
---
From what I know: Patchwerk has a 9,500 DPS raid requirement to beat his enrage timer. That is 316 DPS per person with 30 players dealing damage, or 380 DPS per person with 25 players dealing damage.
---
This is the hardest gear check in the hardest raid in Classic. And you need less than 400 DPS per person. Easily achieved by all classes in pre-raid gear, buffs, and consumables.
---
&gt; you feel a bad tank way more than a bad DPS. 
---
Yeah this is kinda what I meant. It's equally difficult to be a good tank or DPS, but it's much easier to go around as a bad DPS.
---
Time is money friend
---
Quantity isn't quality
---
Can confirm, I'm corpse running right now

---
Tbh I think I’d like a medium server because i have a rotating work schedule and I’d be able to farm stuff without competition at peak times which is all the time on thalnos
---
“No loot for me”
---
“Wants a piece of loot”
---
Does not compute.
---
Isn't that a UI replacement?
---
Lol how are so many people misunderstanding your post? You clobbered an alliance warlock 4 out of 4 times. Oh right, they're mad you're horde... :(
---
And in magical fairy land splash damage doesn't exist and tanks don't give themselves a healing debuff.
---
Not a fan of the lies, not healthy for the Community.
---
I don't know the answer to your question, but I can tell you that Mankrik is the only NA PvE server to be horde dominant.  Normally PvE skews heavily toward the alliance, but because of the name "Mankrik," that's where everyone who wants to roll horde ended up.
---
I just picked up the [Blackblade of Shahram](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12592/blackblade-of-shahram#comments). Is there a way to configure WeakAuras to notify the party/raid when it procs?
---
I've set up the Fist of Shahram based on when I receive the buff, but I'm having a hard time trying to figure out how to track the offensive spells cast by Shahram. It's also pretty hard to test because the proc rate is so random :(
---
Any help would be greatly appreciated!

~~Sometimes~~ Oftentimes you get those healers that refuse to drink.

Even 15 years ago players worked out you can kill the boss with all towers up if you just focus down the captains first and keep corpse running.  The only thing you actually need is the grave yard

Punishment has been shown as a very ineffective way to teach people.
---
Key word is WHEN. Why is the discussion going in on the one scenario where it isn't an issue?
---
Giving yourself a -50 healing debuff is a dumb move if you are the tank.

It's right on the tooltip. It's a flat % chance to proc on hit. Combat sword rogues want a fast offhand sword, not a dagger. Poison procs are fine, but the important thing is your offhand attacks proc'ing sword spec swings of your mainhand. The damage from this trumps running a fast dagger offhand just for poison procs.
---
So like so many People said a billion times over mentality is one thing, patch notes another... 
---
Unreasonable expectations have failed both retail and Classic wow
---
If it was a piece of equipment no one would bat an eye. But mats to make said equipment? Never in my time have I come across a group that had an issue with that.
---
I have done over 50 solo jump runs at about an average of 28 minutes per clear. I can average about 20g per run with no reall good RNG (no essence of water from hydro boss, no arcane crystals/blue saphs) off just the boss bops and various trash mob drops + thorium. Can be over 100g a run with some luck as I have had 3 separate runs with 2 arcane crystals per run.
---
As for the difficulty it really isn't hard st all. Specced deep affliction and then enough points into demonology to get demonic sac so you can have the VW health regen is about all you need. Curse of doomx2 is about all you need for the first two bosses as long as you keep up corruption, sl, and immolates when you can. I only have the satyr helping me for the first boss. Second boss is more about LoSing every sac because if you don't each sac increases fight duration by at least 40 seconds. Helpful hint you can absorb the full extent of his shadow word pain by using your shadow ward spell.
---
The final boss is the only challenging fight for me as it is somewhat unreliable how often he casts his mana draining poison and his disease nuke. Two revelations made the fight 10x easier, one you should bandage whenever the dot isn't on you so your health stays full despite the couple of taps you need. Secondly when the imps spawn CAST SIPHON ON THEM ALL! They are literally free healthpacks. As long as you don't tap yourself too low that the disease dot cast can kill you (it does 800 damage upon landing) from this moment on you have an unlimited health pool thanks to 6 or 7 siphons healing you at the same time. Just keep jump kiting the boss until he drops!
---
For the record I am not uber geared either. I am full pre-raid bis with 2 pieces of T2 and using the DMW shadow damage dagger (with 30 spell power). Sitting at about 300 shadow damage, 3.6k health, and 4k mana. Professions are mining/eng.
---
Horde Whitemane here, no problems finding any groups, get a better guild.
---
Logically i meant the part where Orc tanks actually use Bloodfury - I'd use when i solo, but if im tanking a dungeon it will likely sit and collect dust unless i'm in a situation where i wont be healed for 30seconds anyway.
---
Though it would funny enough appear that people assumed i was the brand of "tank" who would pop bloodfury recklessly.
---
I'd use Recklessness as a tank before Bloodfury any day of the week.
---
The them is probably Channen...the one person you shouted out.
---
People loved the hardcore 60 posts right after launch, now we're seeing people pushing to 60 just before p2. It's a feel good story, why else is /r/wholesomememes one of the top subs.
---
The proper response to that kind of human filth is to corpse camp them in rotation 24/7 until they delete their account.
---
Nope, level faster.
---
Because you said you do it every time dumbass.
---
There’s many other addons that do the same thing... 
---
Or you’re like me and don’t give a fuck about meters
---
I've sent money via alts many times and have never seen the dialogue you speak of. Just gotta be careful which button you have selected.
---
That's the Warrior secret. Go hard or go to Shadowlands.
---
They released diremaul when they did because they were behind on their internal schedule of content releasing. Why were they behind? Because of layering issues. All of phase 2 was scheduled for release when they released diremaul, they just coudn't because of world bosses.
---
I think the world will be a shit show till late jan.
---
I'll heal locks in combat as long as I have mana and I will dropt them a Renew when I can before drinking. Refusing to heal party memebers is equally as rude as refusing to drink in a dungeon.
---
Except the entire separate game is a 15yo game that people are paying monthly to play, just for the release month it was worth for them.  
---
As for the data, well yeah, it's just my opinion, but I wish Blizzard would release data about retail and classic.
---
I don't need bad tanks. I'm a great heal. I have tanks begging me to heal for them often enough.
---
sounds like a paladin specific problem as you dont get plate till 40 right?  i think 40-50 is slow as fuck tbh
---
There are dozens of us... Dozens!
---
Sounds like you're the kinda tank that tanks. As a healer, that's what I like.
---
And I don't assume an orc will pop it. But they are (I know, I know) the only ones who use it. (;
---
You =/= most people
---
Oh boo.
---
No healers should be needing to be innervated. Everyone should be expexted to rune+major pot. With that said, I find the most success being a tank healer and spamming ht4 on him the whole fight. Very rarely using other spells.
---
and then never use it because he's dps
---
Use it every day on my server. People needing on boes get tossed and called a ninja. It’s only here on Reddit people like to act like they need on boes. Maybe they do.. maybe it’s acceptable on faerlina and herod. You’ll get black listed quick on other servers.
---
I assure you I know a lot of people ready to raid cities once they hit 60
---
I think he means cause the locks would keep draining their own life pools. It can be annoying sometimes
---
I killed Herod like that on an SM run once. We were under leveled and started wiping, tank and DPS started dying, myself and the healer tried to kite him. He was using SW:P and I was trying to use rupture. I was run in and try to hit him but of course he would hit me like a freight train. 
---
Eventually the healer died and as he did, Herod literally had a sliver of health left with a SW:P ticking away. I hit sprint and jumped off the top into the floor and literally 360 no-scoped him with a single rifle shot thinking I was going to die but instead it crit him and killed him. 
---
It was probably one of my coolest kills ever.
---
I’m working on that grind myself.
---
i was poor alrdy lol
---
Why would arthas tears increase in price though? Isn't it absolutely useless throughout the game?
---
Tank: about to attack fort mob   
---
Hunters pet: so anyway, I started growling
---
Not the hero we wanted but the one we needed.
---
You could just make a char on there to check the LFG and similar and see how active it is. 
---
There is a good likelyhood that if your server is extremely horde leaning, a lot of alliance has/will transfer over to that other server. So it could be the alliance population on that new server is actually better than on your current server.
---
I gave up a while ago but I’m on the most populated NA server..grats!
---
Cool
---
HELLFIRE!!!
---
Not only that. Fury Warriors have another Fear immune CD called Death Wish which lasts 30 seconds, so you can Berserker Rage, then Death Wish, then Berserker Rage again for a total of 50 second straight of fear immunity, if need be.
---
Hunter has viper sting which is absolutely incredible versus casters, and beats most caster classes especially if you get the first shot. Biggest weakness is a deadzone most players can't stay in and it feels like leeway was exaggerated when they removed layers and I have been missing most deadzones.
---
I’m curious how you know when bwl is coming out?
---
I try, but the spirit healer won't let me pass.
---
Was the fifth an enhancement shaman cause I had the same exact experience. The warrior was going absolutely crazy with the pulls and at least one person would die every pull.
---
Keep in mind west servers are located in Los Angeles and east in Chicago, so your ping could be affected. Personally people say it’s not a huge difference but I beg to differ. I can absolutely tell a difference between 25ms and 75ms. 
---
If you’re playing in a server that’s literally cross country you’ll feel it.
---
Horde can't read
---
High is good.  No Q times but still plenty of activity.  High during peak hours I should say
---
Why would you ever dismiss that way? I just have a small pet section on my action bars that includes it.
---
Have you put recount as only showing current fight DPS? Because Details shows you the DPS of the fight you are in. It could be your recount shows the overall DPS of every fight.
---
Someone edit hunter shoulders on him, and change “blasting” to “pulling”
---
Millennials are the new boomers.
---
You'll need to provide proof for that, I've heard that lowering to 200ms may provide more of a vanilla feel because of better internet connections but that's speculation. What about people who still have shitty internet? As far as I know it was 400ms in vanilla.
---
Jesus Christ, no. Don't make the game last 6 months.
---
As a warlock for pvping I have been torn. I know Soul Link into affliction is technically the best 1v1 spec (once you get enough gear) but I am feeling like going a hybrid 23/17/11 to get siphon, exhaustion, fel dom, and shadowburn. With no shadow mastery my dots are not quite as lethal but having the ability to burst with shadowburn is super tempting. Am I just better off going deeper affliction, or can my fucked up spec actually get some work done in pvp?
---
I was specced into a fury/prot build that uses 1h/shield dude was telling me to go full prot for a BRD arena run if i was going to tank. We were all level 60....
---
Iirc, the letter F is the default keybind for assisting your target
---
I agree with this in great measure. On the other hand, I had people not wanting me to heal low level dungeons as shadow priest.
---
I fully expect to be several ranks after the first week solely on the honor gained from the world boss fights. It’s gonna be a war of attrition.
---
Shadow priest shouldn't heal, takes spots from us real healers
---
&gt; for everyone
---
Except the hunter designated to defend the point near respawn.
---
Sounds like racism to me. Let that orc sunuv a motherless ogre die.
---
I've bought plenty of recipes from the AH that I know cost a little less from far off vendors.
---
I also have a dedicated bank alt that purely trades in vendor recipes. 
---
Markup is usually 300%-400% minimum.
---
This one guy selling FPP recipe gets you mad enough to post on reddit? Jesus. 
---
"gougers sitting all day in the AH on another account" ...lol wtf? 
---
why would they need another account? and why would they be sitting "all day"? 
---
"no lifers" 
---
lmfao...these are basic transactional markups...
---
"I’m going to inform as many people as I can so he can never make a g again"
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
you're gonna make sure he can "never make a g again" by posting on reddit about this one guy posting one overpriced recipe on your one realm.
---
Congratulations, you sure showed him.
---
This is something only you can answer.
---
But personally I would stay on full pop servers.
---
Congrats, we had a guildie get that this week. My personal gem was getting a lucky skull flame shield in a mixed guild run of ubrs. I told them straight up I’m needing that if you want to need against me you can. Then rolled need everyone greeted letting me have it instantly equipped. Looks great next to might shoulders.
---
People really are comparing being a phase behind to being an expansion behind lmfao. It's a PvP update to give the PvP base some content give me a break. Yes come join ignore the naysayers
---
What addon shows raid bosses abilities as timed cast bars in the middle of the screen.  I have classic cast bars but it doesn't seem to be doing what I saw.
---
Also, how do you set up raid frames so that it is two rows of 4 parties?
---
Thanks in advance for any help.
---
simple: don't go to group where something reserved.
---
overhealing is fine if you're also doing a lot of raw healing. overhealing a lot is only bad if it's all you're doing.
---
Rage is weird so it depends. I don't mind people pulling threat on trash mobs. Crits happen after all, but if you're pulling threat on bosses you need to wait for 2-3 sunders which could take anywhere from 5-15 seconds depending on several factors. If I get an early crit or weapon proc I might get 3 sunders out in 5 seconds, but if I get a few misses and a dodge it might take much longer as I wont have nearly as much rage built up in that case. Btw sunders can also be dodged, so keep an eye on the enemies debuffs to make sure the sunder actually hit
---
Children eat that stuff up
---
Nah, it was on Stonespine (stonespire?)
---
People that are making 50g/hour running zf aren't going to bother min maxing every little piece of copper on the AH. If your time is worth nearly a gold a minute, it's not worth the time putting the items back up when you could have just sold them the first time
---
Warlocks ~~Rain of~~ Hellfire
---
Texas
---
I can’t believe you are a 1 year old father
---
DS?
---
In short no, while it’s true that Omni can show you spells from the info in the combat log, the targets positive buffs can only be shown by mages “detect magic” spell.
---
Costs near nothing to post free action potions on the AH. I would put stacks of 5 at a HIGH price compared to market on phase 2 release date till you get a feel for the market.
---
 You don’t pay because its worth that much you pay it for the Convenience of not traveling to go get it...
---
This just in **Mage ports only cost 20s don’t pay 1g to price gougers!!**
---
Under cutters ruin the economy you dumbass way to tank the market.
---
Except that entire separate game took years to develop. This isn't about money, stop trying to strawman me.
---
You don't just develop a game with the intention of getting your playerbase to stop playing it and play something else.
---
My tank friend is making pretty decent gold per hour by setting up group for dungeons which often lack tanks and reserving all mats and non-needed gear, then he picks classes so that there isn't for example plate users for higher chance of getting items. Seems to fill up pretty quickly compared to charging gold up front, people are just happy to attempt get their bis items and he gets the rest. I guess that's what happens when the server is flooded with healers and dps compared to tanks.
---
No Ravager on warriors is so good because how easily it procs. Sweeping strikes, WW, Cleave make it very easy to proc. I leveled from 37-52 doing melee cleave and Ravager is amazing. I’m horde side but warriors get so much out of it because they can easily proc it while shamans can’t.
---
If the tank takes some dangerous burst, PW:S him and cast a greater heal. It's a safe way to recover.
---
You gotta do a lot more than 20 runs
---
Now this is what I was looking for my whole life!
---
does anyone know why devilsaur leather has been decreasing rapidly in price on the AH? I just now can farm devilsaur and im a bit disappointed at the new price (4g per leather). Should it continue to go down?
---
Yeah, you aren’t on a crazy hamster wheel for loot in Classic, like you are retail. That is is very off putting for a large portion of the playerbase, especially for extended periods (which were at the start of year 4).
---
I am up for changing it to 100ms or lower. If you think of it in terms of tick rate, the server on this matter only has an astonishing 2.5 tick rate. In comparison, in any MMO, tick rate should be at least 20. (GW2, BDO, etc.)
---
However, I think it would be hard to get them to change because while they are enjoying the cheaper server, the blind #nochange people and the uninformed are defending for them, and you can't really have a reasonable debate with people that choose to be ignorant.
---
You are correct but minor mechanic correction. Crusader is ppm, so weapon speed is not going to change up time with just auto attacks.
---
If you are alliance you usually are a troll hunter.
---
Tank: white hit
---
Me: OCD rebuffing the whole group
---
Took me a while back in Vanila. Was so happy when I finally got it. Grats
---
Yeah, it’s pretty nuts on paper. A little more intuitive in practice, but still very complicated and a HUGE time sink
---
retail bad
---
Anyone else forget how toxic the retail community is? Just logged into retail for first time in ages, did a dungeon and died because tank mass pulled and didn't take aggro. 
---
I asked for a res, and I got kicked because 'no slackers'.
---
done 100 dungeons in classic last few weeks and everyone has been nice, 1st dungeon in retail and and this happens:/
---
I know its not much of a question, and more of a rant. But just everything in retail feels so 'off'. No one talks or interacts. Joined a few dungeons now, and always say Hi when i zone in, so far only 1 person has responded, whole run is just silent
---
Why would you want to hide your talents? Da fuk wrong wit chu?
---
Ahh cool, thanks
---
Doesn't work. XP gains are crap if you have a 60 (or other significantly higher level) boosting.
---
Yeah.  Carrot, spurs, and glove enchant all stack together.  Use all 3 for maximum fastness.
---
It's a matter of principle though. If you're joining a guild/raid/PvP group/whatever where people require you to spec a certain way, you should do it or not join, not lie about it.
---
Yet.
---
alliance dominated stalagg?
---
I work 70+ hours per week, have a rich social life and i am close to dinging 60 on my SECOND char. 
---
I started playing 2 weeks after launch btw
---
I don’t do a lot of solo content so there’s no need for me to boost my personal dps. That being said,  I don’t believe the superior dps of an Elehybrid or deep enh healer outweighs the mana efficiency of deep resto in dungeons.
---
Now taking donations to replace the Nintendo 64 I’m running classic on.
---
What the fuck kind of groups are you getting
---
Yous a bitch
---
I love people choosing pvp servers and crying about the inevitable.
---
As a lock, I was so hyped to get my tier 1 shoulders. I no longer look like a twilights hammer NPC...
---
Nah 42-47. Get a couple quests in Tanaris, handful in feralas then... 3 in the hinterlands.
---
yeah that makes more sense than charging gold. People are more willing to give away "unneeded" stuff than paying with gold, even though it's effectively the same.
---
Welcome to reddit
---
Wtf my money!
---
For a player starting new on a pvp server.. Is phase 2 going to be bad? Should I just roll PVE. I don't plan on raiding or being super hardcore, a little more than casual maybe.
---
Tribute and DM:E should be better gold.
---
I certainly meant it in a rude way, but I appreciate your comment. It's often hard to think objectively when you over-obsess about everything. Like the time I felt upset for saying, "YOU'LL BE REPORTED TO THE CYBER POLICE, AND THE STATE POLICE!" in general, thinking it could be understood as a threat if people didn't get my reference.
---
Thank you.
---
Yeah, sadly I think this may be a big contributor to the decline of the MMORPG as a genre.   The internet has made it very easy for even a casual player to min/max everything that they do, and the tryhard players punish the players who don't follow these guides by not inviting them to things.
---
Make an alt unless you really don’t want to
---
It’s sold by a vendor bro take a midol
---
I did this so much back in woltk was hilarious. Is there any way to tell if someone actually reported you if the messages are the same?
---
He ruined his chances to make any money because now people know a vendor sells it.  The only people mad at this are price gougers.
---
Healers are everywhere (on my server, anyway), shadow can still heal if needed. And priest PvP includes tons of dispelling and shielding, which you can do in shadow form. Also gives you extra protection against the legions of rogues, warriors, and hunters that will try to kill you. Plus silence, a snare with mind flay, blackout procs...
---
Basically, you can play a support priest as either shadow or disc and be successful.
---
I guess you need to brag
---
No. The answer and numbers are right in front of you. You’re just being lazy
---
It's heaven for hunters, you get all the rare pets!
---
Wait for Phase 2
---
Locks should not expect healing for life taps. We tap to keep dpsing but monitor health and can just switch to life drain. Don’t fret
---
A lock without lifetap is just a crappy mage
---
I didn’t care until someone was a dick about it.  Now people know the game sells it to you instead of a drop - you’re welcome.
---
Confirming it works, I just did it with 2 accounts. Second account has to be yours otherwise your name is reserved. Did it for a level 60 toon.
---
It works, just did. With a level 60.
---
feral druid bis tank weapon was available instantly.  lionheart, onslaught girdle, titanic etc.  who cares if a couple pieces of gear are bis for the entire game.  It's not the full set, just a piece here and there.  Who cares if tank druids have more options for gearing anyways.  
---
I dont think they should change anything, to be clear.  I just don't think it's a huge deal.  There are already pieces that will not be replace that take less effort to get.  
---
And to be fair, the weapons are rank 14.  Weapons are far from BIS for the full game.
---
So you’re mad more people are informed about your markups?  Shame.
---
My favorite gold making item nooooooooo.......
---
Thank you, exactly what I was after.
---
You know it has a stock of 1, right?
---
"Tired of paying 60g for a black lotus? You can pick it up in Silithus for free."
---
(Also not sure how someone can be "tired" of something that only needs to be done once, but w/e)
---
That name... *sigh*
---
Lmao so demanding. It’s not like your offering anything of substance yourself.
---
It's about the threat add-on that details has. Anyone half way serious about the game needs a threat meter or else they risk the whole group's success.
---
You forgot that priests always shield the warrior even when he tells them that he can’t build rage in a bubble.
---
will check it out
---
Damn totally trying this
---
Yeah, no, 5g for a 16s pattern is never worth it, don’t defend gougers.
---
No one really knows how it’s going to go down, but I can say that the hardcore pvpers are already level 60, so the lowest level players they might abuse are level 48.
---
Many many players on pvp servers aren’t on them to farm honor all day. They just want to play the game while having the possibility of open world pvp.
---
Little late

Hi, /u/SmiiLY94

Unfortunately your post has been removed by our AutoModerator because it was thought to belong in our weekly [What Should I Play Wednesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search?q=flair%3AWSIP%2BWednesday&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) thread.

---
Anyone who doesn’t know what a hydro flask is is a boomer
---
I am a boomer
---
This is a solid answer.
---
It’s not a gold, it’s 5 gold for a 16s pattern but I don’t know why you’re defending price gouging for vendor whites.
---
At what point did you get the impression I'm mad?
---
You're hilarious!
---
Or I have enough friends that I don't need to post shit tier "content" to get Reddit's validation and recognition for something as basic as reaching level 60.
---
No one knows but it'll give you that PvP experience. Its all about "honorable kills" so people need to be in your level range to get benefits from it. 
---
This also means that you can decide to PvP too
---
I understand you want proof and math but they are really not worth the effort to provide. You can’t effectively boost lower level players with 60s in classic. The XP split is just soooooo bad. 
---
You could effectively boost with a character ~5 levels higher but thats rough since you need to keep leveling them up too.
---
My suggestion for someone looking to level an alt quickly is to get a bunch of important gear and consumables ready and send them all to the alt so they can be extra powerful while doing a normal questing route, as even on populated servers, dungeon spamming isn’t reliable anymore as the sole source of XP.
---
Every hunter's biggest fear is being invited to a group and having to pretend to be normal
---
dank af
---
He did you a favor saving you time from grouping with a complete noob player.
---
This is **GOLD! xD**
---
I actually cant believe this thread. Its so funny.
---
Bruh are you even gay or are you being offended on the behalf of others? Drink some NyQuil and take a nap, you'll feel better.
---
Do quests. The gold you get from them increase a lot after 40. You'll have enough by level 42 I think
---
This one really brought the gougers out looks like this guy camps the vendor too!!
---
This thread is hilarious honestly.
---
You realize that BGs are a thing on pve servers right
---
&gt; or completely refuse to go dungeons without pay.
---
i don't need a single thing from dungeons anymore; i should just devote 90 minutes of my life to tank for strangers? 
---
roll a fuckin tank if it upsets you so much
---
Tier two? Tier three?
---
50 Shadow Priest here, having fun, but probably switching to Holy soon since my DPS isn’t amazing, and heals are probably more in demand.
---
Am I missing out on anything huge if I don’t level tailoring to craft Priest-specific armor? I’m sitting at 150ish tailoring right now, but I’m interested in dropping that (and enchanting) for herb/alchemy. I don’t have a guild, and I’ll probably be pugging raids when I can (aka no hardcore raiding).
---
On Faerlina there is an orc hunter named Taurenhunter
---
This is sadly and hilariously true.
---
We're all going to make it brother
---
what do you mean ?
---
Yeah this thread is insanity. I lost IQ reading OPs comments.
---
You most not be a real healer if a shadow priest can heal as well as you.
---
It could get better, roll horde.
---
I don't and never said i did, i usually let them die if they do the same mistake several times (3+) without doing anything about it
---
The only people mad at this post are people trying to take advantage of others stupidity by not looking something up.  Sorry for wanting to save noobs money over trying to line the pockets of no lifers camping a pattern lolololol
---
Oh I could be mistaken. Maybe that exists in retail. I thought it was something like “Really send Leeroy 10g?”
---
Let's be honest, with diremaul already out, phase two has very little to offer. Yeah it might have the pvp system, but it doesnt have any battle grounds to go along with it. So unless you're going to camp flight paths, good luck making any pvp rank progress. Also the chances of most guilds ever getting the tag on world bosses is so slim that they might aswell not even exist in the first place.
---
I won’t be too excited til I actually see it. I thought it would come with dire maul so not jumping the gun but damnnnnn do I want that key ring so here’s to hope
---
Id say no.
---
You're a dum dum
---
Hellfire has a bigger threat modifier.
---
I just respecced into a hotw spec so I wont have leader of the pack but I should look into that head gear anyway. Seems really nice.
---
Gz guy
---
Most tanks don't even spec deep into protection tree anymore. (and the whole DW tank thing too)
---
Most of them use this build instead [Fury/Prot](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LZVV0VLxoVoxfzoe).
---
I raid with this just fine (both when I DPS or Tank).
---
And you don't need 31 points in protection tree to tank a dg. All you need is 5/5 Defiance.
---
You're only missing 4% Armor with this build. And you can't make much use of Shield Slam in dgs. A Sunder Armor and save 8 rage is always better on trash.
---
tldr: Use this spec. Stay in the guild, DPS in raids (you won't be topping meters since you're not no-lifeing the game anyway), and tank dgs.
---
I'm not sure that kicking you for not running back is "toxic."
---
Time to farm BRD for the next week
---
Lmao you’re the one mad about me informing people not to get gouged if you’re pissed off about it you can get fucked go gouge some more bro sorry about ruining your secret :,( your poor 5g :,(
---
I don’t recommend it there are price gougers who sell patterns at crazy high prices that you can get from a vendor did you know that!
---
On your server probably not. That, however, does not mean that they do not on other servers. I really do not know what you're on about.
---
It costs 5 gold. Anyone is cappable of making more than 5 gold in the time it takes you to travel there. By travelling to the vendor and bying it for 16s, you're essentially losing money as you could be farming and making more instead. You must not like efficiency. Also, I'm not one of these people
---
I’m pretty sure it’s “collect on delivery” because the pedant in me just couldn’t let it go I’m sorry.
---
Yeah I’m not really supportive of people making money by taking advantage of others.  Rather inform people so they can do it themselves.
---
What an absolutely stupid comment. 
---
"Bruh are you even black or are you getting offended on behalf of other people?"
---
How ignorant.
---
Boomer.
---
He didn't die from steroids, it was cocaine.  The dude had a fucking amazing physique but he rode 100% on his genetics and did not adhere the the recreational drug/alcohol free lifestyle that bodybuilders adhere to.  Dude partied and lifted like a mad man, usually it's either or.  Zyzz said fuck that Ima do my own thing and he died from it.
---
&gt; unless you’re going to camp flight paths
---
You really have no clue what PVP servers will be like once the honor system comes out, do you?
---
&gt;Your arguments are "HAH GOTCHA" style just like him.
---
...ok? I don't watch Ben Shapiro seeing as I'm not an alt-right extremist who wants to ban black people from video games &amp; movies, so I guess I'll take your word for it. 
---
&gt;I gave you evidence of how he's been racist
---
And he got banned **thé same day** that evidence came to Blizzard's knowledge. 
---
You're just complaining for the sake of complaining, even when there is nothing to complain about. You're like the embodiment of a slacktivist. 
---
"Do better"
---
-Actually they banned him literally thé instant they found out
---
"well if black characters wasn't in the game, this would've never happened"
---
They never said what you claim they did.
---
Here is what they actually said https://blizzardwatch.com/2019/10/07/wow-classic-phase-2-coming-2019/
---
They said before the end of the year. Nothing about late december. Only thing you should be pissed about is you not understanding what they said and jumping to conclusions of what you thought they said.
---
It’ll take months of grinding Fire resist and rep gear before rag goes down
---
No, I think you just took 60/5 = 12, and added 15+15+15+15. Which makes 72. My guess.
---
If you add them all first =120 and then divide by 5, you get 24.
---
Mind your parenthesis. If you take the average of something and you get a number bigger than it should be in immediate red flag.
---
Sorry, you are just wrong.
---
Ravager is the best for aoe all the way to brd when you can get angerforges axe or go sword spec with destiny.
---
"should I play a game?" he asked on a forum that is dedicated to said game. What did you think the response would be?
---
Look healers, I'm aware of your mana situation. Your mana is my health. If I'm full HP and you're at 10% mana, that means I'm at 110% health.
---
That being said, if you sit down to drink and the next pack is a group of 2 with no real threatening mob and I have all my CD's up guess what: we're pulling.
---
If you really think you need to drink to full at this point - fine, do it. I'm not pulling because I haven't looked at your mana, I'm pulling because I'm confident we can handle it.
---
I'd definitely disagree, and especially so in Classic over newer expansions like TBC (to a degree) but even MORE so from wrath and onwards.
---
To tank, you definitely cant just turn off your brain, you have to focus for the whole dungeon, and pay attention. But as a dps, you can just follow the skull mark mindlessly and press your 1-3 buttons without doing much more.
---
So you want to go back to when we were all ignorant? That doesn’t work for a 15yo game. Being ignorant as a form of artificial difficulty only remains entertaining for so long, after that players have passively learned to be better or they’ve taken the time to test information. That’s just how gaming is done nowadays. Players learn to optimize.
---
Also, as /u/typed-talleane said, there’s no way Classic would or could ever have been more challenging than Retail. Anyone that even entertained the notion is a fool. The most basic of fights in retail are multiple times more complicated than a majority of vanillas. The hardest of vanilla would only be on par with mid-tier of heroic difficult content of retail, at best.
---
Yeah, it'd be more fun contracting Ebola than playing on one.
---
No one can make 5 gold by running to stone talon inn are you fucking stupid?  I’m informing people that the vendor sells this for 16s why would you give a shit about it unless you’re trying to make money from it yourself?
---
But his narrative!
---
It's cool mate. Typical error when you mash it all together on a calculator.
---
Yeah, calling people PC when they call out your bullshit is boring, too. Fuck off.
---
Maybe one of them in this case only calculated while combat whereas the other one also took time while ooc?
---
Truefaith Vestment is the best chest piece by far, but is it worth getting depends only on you.
---
?
---
They do not I guess.
---
I remember in vanilla, I was in the warlock channel, the clothie channel, the ranged channel, and a joke channel.
---
That won't prevent the unmarking of the target though. If something is already marked with moon, that macro will unmark that target. u/axrael
---
I googled it and found this script:  
---
/run local i = 8 if GetRaidTargetIndex("target") ~= 5 then SetRaidTarget("target", 5) end
---
That will mark the target with moon and won't unmark it if it already has moon. If it has another mark already, it will change the mark to moon. Change the two numbers 5 in that macro to the numbers of the mark you want.
---
BRD 52+. Diremaul 56+. LBRS either 56 or 58+ I forget sorry. UBRS/Strat/Scholo 58+.
---
It's a bit more nuanced, a lot of those low end numbers are for specific run types BRD 52-54 is only really arena/anger/golem for example.
---
Durrr durrr google is hard!!!!
---
He probably clicked off his bubbles to gain rage of being damaged as bubble negates rage generation when being attacked.
---
Bubble is good for emergency situations, but not before pulling.
---
I would go full resto for raids but I wouldn't do that until 60 imo. You still need to kill things. Having some points in resto is good, for my shaman I actually grabbed 14 resto before starting down the enhance tree. The +hit is actually one of the best dps boosts anywhere in any tree.
---
Yeah I agree, people should realise life tapping is just moving mana from one bar to the other, and we can easily return it to the other bar if needed. ( drain/syphon life, deathcoil and health Stone)
---
A lock at 100% health is wasting  both mana and health.
---
On skull? It doesn't matter. You are expected to pull threat and the mob to die before it does any significant damage.
---
Yeah. As someone who is approaching level 50 on my main, I’m really dreading the release of p2.
---
Okay guide, you do miss some things that makes this run so much smoother. Shadow resistance, from gear and/or if u run with a priest shadow prootection can make you resist most sacrifices. Being an engineer helps alot as u can use shadow reflector against sacrifices and dense dynamite for killing imps. If you do run it as duo ms spec trumps fury as it reduces healing from sac.
---
Actually, it seems to proc on the last or second to last hit needed to kill that single target.
---
&gt; You can look like him in like 3 years of natural training.
---
GTFO.
---
Guess you answered it for me.  Its so researched its easy mode.   I'll probably be going back to retail.   It was a fun grind though, I suppose!  Nice to actually play BRD again.
---
Yes, it's a long chain in blasted lands
---
The last 2 parts of the chain require a party to complete 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=3628/you-are-rakhlikh-demon
---
As a healer it's fine, I'll replace your egotistical ass 🤣🤣 Bro it's just a game. Calm the fuck down crybaby
---
Under cutters under cut everything. It’s not in just this recipe lmao if the player is to stupid to go to the vendor themself they should be getting marked up.
---
Iron and mithiril are going for 1 to 2g a stack on my server so quest and mine. Alternately farm elemental fire from fire elementals in arathi highlands. A stack of those can go for 10+ gold
---
if you think anyone is camping particular recipes that hard, there's only one thing to be said about stupidity
---
&gt;I'm already bigger than him lol
---
That's because he was smol.  Fucking fantastic physique but he wasnt even big enough to compete in classic physique.  People admire him for his physique, he never won any real titles from what I recall.
---
Hmm, not quite what I was saying but I respect it lol
---
Best pet in the game for leveling as well but def not worth camping just to level with haha.
---
You probably immediately call people who text you with a question, don't you?   Prick.
---
But why would you want to group with an idiot who thinks that anyways?
---
Well yeah retail has mythic but lets not pretend that in retail everyone does not know their bis items as soons as the game launches. They do.
---
Its incredibly homogenized.   I must be one of the only night elf warriors on the server, it feels like.  And the thing about rolling on someone's BiS... oh hell no, you better not!   And hell, even fury warriors have leather on their BiS list, so if you're a rogue you're supposed to just know not to roll on that.
---
Sorry to tell people about another one of your super smart money making secrets :,(
---
I get "/w wanna tank XXX, last spot ;)" all the time at least 1-2 times per hour. I don't blame them, they are tired of waiting and want to start their run asap.
---
Considering we're already about to get phase 2, I'd say a new phase every 3 months is fair.
---
In a Warrior/Priest duo group how much should the the Priest be attempting to add dps? What heals are most efficient for keeping the warrior up without risking oom too early in a large fight or emergency situation?
---
Get a mage, paladin or warrior fill up the group make sure ur alt is highest level and ur all set
---
Came here to say this, thanks! :)
---
Tank dungeons dps raids.
---
Fastest way to level is to keep doing your thing. Keep questing, keep moving. Dont worry about it taking a long time. You are having the "vanilla" experience right now. You will be 60 soon enough. Some say levels 40 to 50 are slower than 50 to 60. Dont worry about what speed levelers and no lifers are doing. They are missing out on an entitre part of the game.
---
MC is in it’s dumbed down nerfed to all hell state.
---
BWL is gonna slap a lot of people in the face who are expecting an MC 2.0 gear depository.
---
Funny because I doubt many people from the actual boomer generation play this game.. they are all like 55+ years old now.. not saying that none of them play.. but being a father and having a full time job doesn't make you a boomer
---
They want to run in a subpar spec, but lie to people and say they are in a good spec.
---
Your meltdown on this thread is hilarious to watch
---
Sure don't. Texting would be using their words. Similar to typing out a message in Warcraft.
---
If a warrior charges me while I'm fighting a mob I will still kill him as a mage
---
Also I was mainly refering to the fact that most mages wont be experienced pvpers, probably, so if they're distracted doing something (fighting a mob, for example) they probably won't have a clue what to do
---
A hunter could aim shot multi but the mage will see it coming, in theory a druid could probably do the same thing as a rogue &amp; have the ability to shift roots, but I don't really know what druids do
---
Point being if your main point is to kill mages outside of literal 1v1 duels with all CD's just go rogue and ambush them for half their life and watch as they panic and probably waste a block or something then you have two blinds
---
Thanks!
---
For clarity, the pattern is BOE but the robes are BOP.
---
The next best thing is a chest drop from strat undead.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13346/robes-of-the-exalted
---
I've been busy gearing my warrior tank - so yeah I would've liked a bit longer of a heads up to get my rogue to 60 - now I'll probably not get there in time and I definitely won't have time to gear up at all.
---
I’ve been playing hybrid specs all game, and when I come to heal or tank people don’t care they’re just happy to be able to start.
---
I often wonder when I was a kid and my English was bad did I sound just like you on the internet.
---
Lol it hurts but it's true
---
Start your own groups.. most people that complain about lack of groups don't take initiative and create their own.
---
I understand that it's kind of scary but i would say there is a decent chance to not suffer so much. Being on the dominant faction helps a lot, and then classic tactics to not got camped still apply (mainly being smart about rez sickness/waiting on your respawns). Otherwise my adivice would be mounting up groups that plan to go for heavy reset far , so atleast you limit the corpse run/dungeon run ratio. Instances portal camping should be a thing but i doubt it will spread out of brm, and it is already a thing here anyways.
---
Go to /r/buildapcforme or /r/buildapc 
---
Tell them your budget and the games you want to play now and in the future.
---
But classic will play on a 5 year old laptop at this point.
---
Is there a macro that makes fishing easier?
---
Haven't heard of this build before, thanks!
---
At least a few
---
Ik but some ppl prefer 2hand, and vs single target, a faster weapon with 2hand fury isnt a big problem
---
Av is p3
---
You're right about the BiS list chase, for sure.  Actually, everything you said is right on.  We can't put the toothpaste back into the tube and go back to WoW when we were clueless how everything works, but this is what we knew we were getting into when we asked for classic.   It's a different experience in the same (for the most part) game.  I think Vanilla was alliance dominated because of the "prettier race" thing.  Now classic is horde dominated because the community consensus is that horde is better for PvP.  Tons of things are different, but I don't long for the good ole days when my warrior would have been called a ninja for need rolling on truestrike shoulders.   It's a different experience this time around, and I'm fine with that.
---
Better go cancel your auctions and put them up for half of what they were before so you feel better about yourself :,(
---
Pagle? I know a Dwarf Priest.
---
You're forgetting the most important part: you could draw dicks anywhere in the world! Anywhere in the world you wanted to paint a dick you could!
---
They already have to do (and have done) that. 
---
None of the items/mobs/quests in the game in retail have set values anymore. Everything is the solution of an equation. So outlands quests are what, lvls 60 through 80, right? So every quest you do there will be player level, or player level +1, with a range of 60 to 80. The quest rewards you get from those quests are of a certain item level range. 
---
They do that because they keep translating content from X to Y. 
---
Raids/dungeons are like that. They establish a raid/dungeon and then tone it down by a factor of X for Raid Finder, and turn it up for heroic/mythic. They don't individually adjust every single thing in the game. Its part of why they have so many mechanics for making items stronger, because they already do it to even create the items. Remember the rewards you'd get for doing random dungeons? The gloves/boots/cloak. They worked just like greens (in that they had a suffix which gave stats depending on it), and the itemlvl depended on your level when you finished the dungeon.
---
Also, relax with the whole "everyone who disagrees with me is wrong" angle. Retail WoW is really really broken and they probably won't ever give it the adjustment it needs so players are left with whatever they get. Some people are going to be optimistic about it. Maybe it'll make leveling more enjoyable/popular, who knows. 
---
We have classic, after all.
---
Gz on 3 manning a 5 man dungeon.
---
One repost a day? =)
---
Okay that was pretty funny. You won me over
---
Very mad, wish BGs were with P2. :)
---
Yeah ...you're not really funny any more...
---
Kinda just sad really..
---
Shut up
---
Oh wait, I may be using the wrong words. Are battlegrounds in classic? I am talking about things like Arathi and Warsong Gulch
---
Lol I don't think a fury/prot warrior is going to make the raid do 2x more damage :D it makes the difference when they are losing threat. Other than that...
---
Lol selfish?  Get over yourself
---
The fuck is iMorph?
---
Pretty much everyone I asked on the daily help thread said Wolfshead is pretty much BiS forever for ferals, and I bought mine on the AH for 4g, no fuss. Should be less useful for non-ferals because it has almost no stats otherwise, but it should still help speed up your fights a little at least for leveling
---
Dw, you're still getting booted from the raid when you're dead last on the meters in PvP spec.
---
Literally anything that takes one item or one item and a spice.
---
My personal favorites were any kind of Omelet that used eggs.  Grind raptors or other egg dropping critters.  Also when you get higher level keep all of your mystery meat for stew - requires either one spice or water I think.
---
It was great at the launch :) now it's just ok.
---
My guild is power leveling alts through dungeons with 60s, its actually stupid easy so far.
---
You joking or what? The Prot warrior Pre-raid BiS has items from:
---
Strat UD
---
UBRS
---
LBRS
---
Scholo
---
DM East/West/North/Tribute
---
The only dungeon that Tanks really don't need is Strat Living which is why it's so common to have them reserve the first Orb.
---
Bubbles prevent gaining rage from taking damage. Do not ever shield a (warrior, druid) tank unless he's about to die.
---
Is this someone who DOESNT appreciate the game as a whole telling other players that they don’t appreciate it as a whole? Wtf? Lol
---
&gt; Pvp does not make something rewarding or not, risky or not
---
Yes it does.
---
&gt;  Plenty of games have no pvp at all and are significantly more rewarding than wow.
---
Comparing two separate games makes no sense here.
---
&gt; If I had to level a second time on a pvp server and especially in todays min/maxing world I would have already quit.
---
Then it's good you don't.  I've never said people should play on pvp servers if they don't want to.
---
&gt;  So is it more rewarding for me not to play at all or play without having to participate in a system I don’t like and won’t play?
---
Again, I never said you should play on a pvp server if you don't want to so this argument is irrelevant.
---
&gt; None of these are facts, they are just my opinion just like yours are.
---
Except my statements are fact.  It is basic psychology that if you overcome a bigger obstacle you feel more rewarded than if the obstacle was trivial.  You perform a task that is difficult, you feel better for having done it than something that was easy.  Some people don't want to be too challenged in their leisure time and that's totally fine.  However the point I was making is simply that to think that by removing a massive mechanic in wow that permeates interactions across nearly the entire game results in no significant changes, you're wrong.
---
&gt;I'm a Priest main, and I'd rather my Lock life taps as long as it reduces downtime and as long as they do it correctly and not at the worst possible time.
---
Nothing you have said here contradicts anything I said ...
---
&gt;Drinking after or on every pull is fine
---
If you got a mage for *free* water sure , otherwise i got an epic mount im saving for so please , dont take unncescary damage and waste my water - its half a gold for 5 fucking waters
---
The only thing that doesn't line up is the top block not being perfectly central due to the small spacing between the bottom columns. Apart from that things line up nicely, it's just that the spell icons are just larger than the empty action buttons.
---
Another metric for healers is overheal.  “Why are you so low on the healing meters?!”...”because the other healers have a 50% overheal” aka wast of mana
---
What would one of those sell for if a split runner found one?
---
Ah, like Windfury procs.
---
Buy now! Buy now!

---
Then don't?
---
Why half?
---
Explain the financial reasoning for such a wasteful action?
---
Yeah, you definitely out dps'ed a Perdition's Rogue with pieces of T1.
---
Yea as a healer it depends a little for me. I'll begrudgingly drop a heavy heal on them, maybe a flash heal and or power word shield, but if they choose to use that racial in a situation where they are taking a ton of damage I'm not going to drop mana potions so I can go oom spamming heals on him, lol. 
---
Tbh it'd be fine with me if tanks got in the habit of using the racial ~10-15 seconds before pull.. That way it actually might wear off by the time I'm healing them
---
I had a shaman begin to cast chain lightning on my rogue in STV. I see this happening, so I stealth while he’s half way through the cast. The cast completes anyway and removes me from stealth.
---
So did D3 when it was shown. Still pissed about the arena bait and switch.
---
&gt; We tap to keep dpsing but monitor health and can just switch to life drain. Don’t fret
---
"don't worry, I don't need heal" said the warlock who killed himself a few minutes later by using hellfire with 30% hp.
---
Oh wow. Congrats!! I had my winter kitty way back in 07. Still my favorite thing I've ever gotten on that game!
---
Me at 1k hp,
---
Bloodrage sounds pretty good right now

Is Eu having log in problems right now?

It’s just so funny by defending this so hard you’ve revealed you make money off of this ploy

It’s nice to see some wolf appreciation. Love my Swift Dire Wolf :D (orc though, less effort)
---
:(
---
Never happened to me, must not be a thing!  Said the moron in a thread of people sharing their stories to the contrary.
---
BWL is harder than MC, but not that much harder, and I think people will be geared enough to handle the increased difficulty.
---
AQ40 is what will slap people in the face.
---
Try it out.
---
Why do you care what I'm doing? Just ignore and move on....
---
It's just supply and demand. People can look up where to find it and go get it if they want to. They are just too lazy to do that and would rather pay the money. You're the one putting in the effort so lazy people can be lazy for even cheaper. Personally I think you're more in the wrong than the other guy.
---
where can you find the new information about this, i cant seem to find it
---
I'm on run 1150 and I'm just about done. Everytume it drops without fail someone needs and I lose. Out of all the runs I've only seen it drop twice.
---
You can’t make 5g by walking to Stonetalon, but mages can make close to 1g every 60 seconds at ZF so the time they spend walking is lost money to them tbh. I always buy my recipes from a vendor but I’m not level capped so I can’t make crazy money like them.
---
He’s prolly running SM Ruin, which is ok for PvP but you have to be on point with your class knowledge. Anyone who plays a lock and wants to PvP will run down the demo tree for feldom and just have 2 sacs on a warrior and just out last him. Most warriors feel alpha in game, like op clearly does, for whatever reason. He was just a bad lock. Don’t be upset when you find a prepared lock and he camps you into a 5 minute respawn timer and you call on your horde buddies for help against a singular clothie. See you around ;]
---
that's why i gotta charge the prices that i chaaaaarge
---
Heyo!
---
Warriors picking up the bad rap now.
---
As a hunter in retail for 10 years and a mage in classic, I'm glad another class is picking up some heat
---
It works just fine to hold agro in DM:N on ~40 mob packs of nonelite mobs. If the dps give me 5 demo shouts, I have full agro on all of them until they die. Through hellfire, through blizzard, etc. in fact, it works so well going down the right corridor in north I pull all 3 packs of nonelites and AoE them all down. 
---
Battleshout does 55 threat per person buffed for 275 per shout (ignoring defiance/dstance modifier). If there’s 40 mobs, this threat is then divided among them, for 6.875 threat per mob. 
---
Using the same 40 mob example, we’ll say the healer heals me for 4000 during the course of the fight. The total amount of healing done ignoring any threat reduction talents is 100 per mob. This means that 3 demos shouts would hold agro off the healer. 
---
Demo shout does a flat threat of 43 per mob. 
---
I legitimately have tested this and it works. Do you even play a warrior or even know what the math is? O.o
---
Right? It's actually even easier than I originally thought now that I'm looking up the numbers. The offtank (which is the more important tank on this fight) only needs 9K HP with ~70% mitigation from armor when fully buffed. I can get that right now, in phase 1 gear, as a Druid tank.
---
Granted, that's with a cape, necklace, shoulders, and ring from MC along with full consumables, but that's still a far cry away from full AQ40 gear.
---
I may be blessed by my guild/server and all but I haven't really experienced this problem.
---
Like sure, tanks want to get their BiS. But that means there's generally a decent amount of them running BRD for HoJ (lel) or Ironfoe (lel 2.0), so what's the issue?
---
I've had a few BRD runs, both guild ones and PUG ones and haven't had anyone quit because of BiS, mostly people just do specific runs (prison, angerforge, arena, etc.).
---
What energy ticker are you using?
---
Can you explain to me how a rogue tanking 4hm could possibly work with the mechanics of the fight? When I played we had times where rogues would tank Instructor Razuvious or Vaelatrasz in emergencies, but 4hm is a fight that requires very specific tank swaps with precise timing and positioning.
---
Imagine losing a roll on Mageblade because your GM decides to bring in a 58 with greens. Same mentality.
---
Anyone who thinks this spell batching is working like Vanilla is a **Blizzard sycophant.** The type of person who would spit in a HK protester's face. There's a reason absolutely NO ONE complained about private servers feeling inauthentic. The current state of the game with batching/leeway is a *disaster* and needs to be addressed immediately.
---
At the beginning of classic our guild just invited pretty much anyone. A few days in we had people using racial/homophobic slurs in guild chat so we gave them the boot. 
---
About 20 more people left saying “this is a video game, who cares if we are racist” or “fucking boomers, don’t even understand jokes” etc. 
---
Seems like a weird hill for people to die on, but apparently people want to do it...
---
If you constantly spam the DoT so it never has time to tick, it never breaks the sheep, but you also never get to DPS anything else *taps forehead*
---
Unless you run into me. I'm shit at the game
---
Think so
---
Nah just informing people so people gouging don’t continue to make money.  Lots of people
---
don’t know this is vendored - if you think I’m in the wrong you’re part of the problem.  You just want to make money off of people being lazy and are mad because the more people know the less advantage you have.  Personally I think you’re sad.
---
Could be better, a dwarf
---
Are you afraid of being critiqued or? If you have nothing to hide (aka dumb talent choices) then you have no reason for this. Nobody is gonna tell you how to play but nobody is gonna inv you either if you run around with questionable choices.
---
Since you seem to be missing this incredibely obvious point, let me provide you with a example. Imagine that I need the recipe, but I also want to be efficient with my time. Instead of travelling there  I can just heartstone back to Feralas or Zul'farak, locations where every person who cares about gold should have his hearstone set to, and farm either of those dungeons. In the time it would take me to travel to the vendor and buy the recipe, I can make more money by solo farming these dungeons, its simply more efficient. 
---
You seem to be angry about price gougers. Its not gouging, its paying that particular person for the time invested in travelling and buying the recipe off the vendor and travelling back. If you're angry about this, are you also angry about food deliveries and other delivery services? As I said, I'm not one of those people, I did not even know that you could buy the recipe off the vendor since I do not care about alchemy. I just joined this discussion since you said its never worth it, which is wrong.
---
I didnt know that about the mystery meat, thanks for the tips buddy
---
I assume the post means they spent their luck on Benediction and Deathcharger rein's but yeah they are still far from the perfect geared toon.

Why would you ever take a free transfer?

Coming off playing a fire mage to an affliction warlock is an interesting change
---
I feel like warlocks bring a ton more ***utility*** to the table with health/soul stones, their various curses etc
---
But god damn seeing a mage do 3x the damage in every fight is pretty brutal
---
There's hardware in play somewhere that's way more powerful than what Blizzard's blades could muster 15 years ago but there's still limitations. 
---
If it were that easy to just reduce and expand on the fly as they please DDosing would be much harder to pull off whereas we had a random dude crash Blizzard's shit over a month ago and we had trouble logging in for days.
---
Yip mate. Look Alive (the guild you see standing on the side there) intercepted us otw out of Kargath and we wiped them. Then we ran to BRM and wiped the other 2 guilds seen in this post on the chain. The alliance on Mograine are sooooo terrible it's funny.
---
In this thread: babies that are gonna re-roll PvE
---
Was in strath living lately with 2 locks. One doing direct dmg, lvl 57. The other one constantly hellfire, lvl 60 in prebis.
---
I needed triple the mana i usually would for that hellfire lock alone. He did less dmg than the other one though...
---
Not really. Many guilds just have trouble filling 40 slots.
---
For the next couple of months, you just need people doing their jobs. The tanks need a good spec/gear obviously, but there's no shortage of tanks
---
If your guild isn't running multiple raid groups or requiring you to farm 5 hours for consumes before raid, a meme spec isn't a big deal.
---
I use everything. I am the healer NSA. During the fight keep a look at heals, overheals and mana. Of all my healers. Mostly so I can tell them to chill down or to reassign people mid fight when I see tank healers are going oom. 
---
As of today will also keep warcraftlogs going to see consumable use, etc. If someone is consistently low on healing, I can inspect them to see their gear and similar.
---
wash yer back!
---
You would really suck off Ion Hazzikostas if he ordered you to, wouldn't you?
---
Maybe if toxicity happens to you all the time you are the problem.
---
There is an addon called fishing buddy that does.
---
Eh pretty sure people wanting easy money without putting work in is as old as the concept of money
---
If you still have shitty internet in 2019, get off the computer and better your life.
---
100% try it out. 
---
Classic is super fun and awesome. The community is also great! 
---
One advice tho dont rush anything and play at your pace. 
---
A little backstory to myself, I rerolled a lot of times at launch and wanted to rush to 60 fast. I got burned out and didn't wanted to play. Took a 2 week break now and will start a new character that will be my main and then play at my own pace:)
---
It was mainly because our group of friends got on different realms and it was a way to all play together again.
---
You'll wipe in BWL don't worry
---
If your guild is packed with people that played 14 years ago.. I can't imagine any group progression would give you the feeling it should.
---
Half the fun for me right now is my guild. Many experienced players as well as many having their first go at Vanilla. Their excitement is contagious and it brings me right back in.
---
&gt; But god damn seeing a mage do 3x the damage in every fight is pretty brutal
---
Why, though? I don't feel affected by it, personally, isn't that just you attaching lots of value to a specific number when there are lots of other factors affecting things?
---
Warlock eventually becomes the highest dps in the game come Naxx so just try and tough it out for now
---
BRD XP runs involve clearing barely into the dungeon to a place called Arena. It's the lowest level area of the dungeon, and it's normal for 52s to be able to handle the content fine.
---
The xp part, if I understand it right, is clearing the mass of non-elites that sit around the arena. You then hop into the arena, kill the random boss hoping for one of the rare drops they can give that are pre-raid bis for some classes, go back out and reset to repeat.
---
it depends. i keep up with some mages if i’m single targeting and we only have 3 mobs or something like that
---
Naxx by June, mark my words. This game has turned out to be another Activision DISASTER.
---
I mean, you are playing a 15 year old version of a game people have been playing their entire lives and has been researched to death it's not like the game being figured out this early is a new thing it got figured out over the 15 years of its life.
---
It is gouging.  This recipe is sold by a vendor.  People aren’t informed the vendor sells this.  I’m informing them.  It is gouging because the price is 5g for a 16s item.  That’s what, 5000%?  Gouging happens to misinformed buyers.  Do you need to look up the definition?  Anyone who has a problem with this is trying to use lack of knowledge to their advantage to make money off of others.  The only people commenting are people that have made money from this and will now probably make less.  If you don’t like being told that a vendor sells an item that people sell for 5000% more then go comment elsewhere.  That’s what I’m doing so you can honestly get fucked.
---
I am using Healbot.  I have left click bound to Flash Heal.  Sometimes it will do rank 1 and sometimes it will do max rank.  Whats going on and how can I fix it?
---
Being utility is great. Bring 40 shards and feel like a hero. Curse of the Elements and I get to claim some of that mage dps too :)
---
druid.  Ive since stopped it doesn't seem worth it on a druid :O
---
This is my life as a tank, and dps get upset in low level dungeons when I tell them to slow down and wait for a sunder, especially on multiple targets. Ran ZF 4 times yesterday, aoe dmg without sweeping strikes or any sunders is all bad
---
Yes Arathi Basin, Warsong Gulch and Alterac Valley were all in vanilla and will be added at a later date.
---
Just did Mara in full today with a sham tank. Can recommend, would do again.
---
I’m referring to account transfer not server.
---
*hugs*
---
That's ok bud. [Just think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE186w91YVU), every time you die in pvp you're making the other person happy they killed a shadow priest!
---
Honestly couldn’t give a shit phase two is just the PvP steam, world bosses, and dire maul, all shit that should on been in phase 1.
---
What I'm saying is I dont know how much dmg the average tank takes while its popped, obviously he should be popping shield block with it, if it's on trash he shouldn't be taking a lot of dmg. I'm also not a healer but I would imagine it's easier to pocket heal the tank than to try to heal the whole group.
---
If you only cast FB in raids, you're a dog mage.
---
I used to /e hugs you in ironforge so some would hug me back. Even in WoW I was lonely.
---
I completely agree with you that they must maintain permanent vanilla servers. But they need to also expand to BC on different servers because while some people will want to do what they did on private servers, others will eventually want to move on.
---
Ploy?
---
My time isn't free, peasant.
---
I played this game for the first time when I was 10 years old and played for about a year. Now I’m 23 and just started playing again. It’s really not hard to believe.
---
You do realize that killing Horde that are lower level than you are not considered “Dishonorable” kills?  You are putting your own RP values into the game.  I respect that, but for me, they kill us so we kill them.  It’s a never ending cycle.
---
No warrior should be protection before like, 54 at the bare minimum.
---
It's just a shift from doing brutal amounts of damage to being more a "utility caster"

Do you tell them the mistake you think they are making or just assume they will learn by dying?

Free enough that you’re trying to convince someone who won’t fall for scams like this to not inform others to fall for scams like this??  Looks pretty worthless to me
---
Very probably.
---
:-/
---
Take a single economics class and you will learn about basic market forces and no longer see any of this as good vs. evil. Supply and demand rules all. There’s nothing scummy about undercutting or gouging. It just is what it is and no one is forced to buy anything at any price in-game.
---
You're fucking dumb lol this is how wow's always worked, if it's really that important people can look up where the recipe is and how to find it. you're not doing some kind of public service by doing this lmfao. the recipe also only has a stock of 1, so it's not like there isn't any scarcity of the item causing the price to go up. get the fuck off ur high horse lmfao
---
Yeah, a tragic case of the suckage.
---
Sorry to the family, we did all we could.
---
I don't really understand why paying 5g for convenience is causing you this much distress. If I don't want to go to a vendor and am feeling lazy and just want to grab a recipie, i'll do that. It's an option. In the time taken to run over there, I could probably make 5g and I prefer to stay in my grind/farm spot to do so. It's like engineering recipies. I can make my own gnomish rocket boots for 6g, or I can buy a premade one for 15g so I don't have to spend time crafting the materials, or buying them. 5 minutes to craft them isn't 'worth' the 9 gold but it sure is convenient.
---
Playing World of Warcraft for the first time is like going to Vegas for the very first time.
---
As you get more experience, you level up certain skills.
---
Spicy thread. Love it.
---
You know not everyone lives in a big city right?
---
The only reason people would try retail is bc of the self-sabotaging batching and leeway to convince people that Classic is shit instead of amazing.
---
Its a decent strat if your strat is to OOM before the fecking fight even starts.
---
I only bubble the party if we are running an AOE farm group (3 mage 1 warlock and me)
---
Otherwise, bubble is for "ohshit the mage pulled agro and his iceblock is on CD, and he went from 90% hp to 10%, bubble so he can nova + blink"
---
&gt;For the 'modern' wow I'd have to pay subs and buy the expansion packs right
---
for classic wow you only have to pay the sub.
---
for modern wow you need to buy the expansions + sub (the same sub that gives you classic) :)
---
I agree they should add character transfers as well, but I think that won’t happen till a later phase due to people wanting to go to already overpopulated servers. That feature also came pretty late into vanilla IIRC.
---
LOL does it trigger you to see a mage make what was probably a good decision? They're pretty close and will only make a difference to someone who wants to min/max for pve in later phases.
---
Plus transcendence helm and truefaith robes, both BiS for p1/2
---
Ah OK, is there any rough date for that?
---
Just 6g?  It’s 40g steady on incendius.  Every time I head up there, even at 5am, multiple people are waiting.
---
And then the patrol comes around the corner and wipes the group because the tank couldn't wait 20 seconds. Before you tell me it wouldn't happen, I can assure you that it has. Several times. I've also experienced tanks underestimating how hard mobs actually do hit. 
---
Forcing healers to cut their drinking early is basically putting extra gold cost on them. Unless they have gotten their drinks from a mage, it can cost several gold in drinks just for a few runs. That cost doubles if you only get to drink half of each before you have to rush forward to save the tank, and using expensive heals to do it, meaning you have drink again after that pull as well. 
---
I'm sorry, I don't say this is what you do personally, but the majority of the tanks I get in PUGs act like it's good enough for the healer to drink to 50/60% mana, regardless of which pack comes next
---
That's very strange. /run SetRaidTarget("target",5) should work like a toggle. If it's not on, it toggles it on. If it's on, it toggles it off. So if it's unmarked or marked with anything that isn't moon, it will mark it with moon. But if it already moon, then it will unmark it. Maybe you have an addon that prevents unmarking?
---
Try being a hybrid and you'll see.
---
That's me
---
Battlegrounds are coming in phase 3. we have no date on when that is yet. You can read more about the phases here  [https://www.wowhead.com/guides/wow-classic-six-content-phases](https://www.wowhead.com/guides/wow-classic-six-content-phases)
---
This is eerily on point to how my group with 2 mages a warrior tank and a hunter just went *sigh*
---
Yes, that's exactly what he's doing.
---
I beat mages frequently in dps especially single target.
---
100% competitive with mages if you're able to keep corruption up...
---
Otherwise I'm about 15% off.  Looking forward to getting some additional spell crit.
---
Healbot may have a setting to automatically downrank. Check the add-on settings!
---
Last night my guild and I had 4 of us wanting to do scholo but we needed a tank. I can only get on for dungeons after 10pm. I went to bed at 12:30 after not finding one for 2.5 hours.
---
No. It's just silly to me is all.

---
I aoe farmed for the first time ever starting at level 22. My advice if it is also your first time, start off only pulling 1-2 mobs at a time until you really get the hang of it. Don’t be afraid to blink away from the pull and get rid of aggro if you might die, it happens and its better to just reset. 
---
I wasn’t too concerned with XP/Hr at first as I knew it wouldn’t be that much with such small pulls, but it really helps you learn the mechanics. Now at 26 with CoC it is pretty easy to do 6+ pulls.
---
Did the group wipe and everyone else but you run back? If so, you’re the asshole.
---
Mostly yes, either hang out in the demon infested part of Winterspring, look around Un'goro/EPL or do jump runs
---
1) Got one, thanks for the hot tip
---
2) idek what you're point is. You're suggesting taking one of the training wheels off for no reason
---
Just FYI you might not be doing anything wrong, rogues are notoriously slow at leveling and moreso if you're jumping into the class for the first time. No sustain. No move speed for traveling from quest area to quest hub except sprint on a mid - long cool down.
---
Honestly, a lot of classic IS the leveling experience.
---
It's less about the specific selection of talents and more about which tree those selections are in.
---
REEEEEE!!! Feral druids can't heal!  Arms warriors can't tank!  Ret paladins should neck themselves!

Why did you roll on a PvP server if you weren’t ready to get to 60 within 2 months .
---
Yes.
---
Oh man. Has any add on been made that shows you which quests you completed?
---
Same...   
---
It's really a bother. Been like this \~20mins for me now
---
Maybe after phase 3 when BGs get added
---
You did the right thing - and something that a lot of healers don't do - in communicating with the party about mana and asking the tank to slow down. At that point, if the tank doesn't listen, the most effective next step is to keep drinking until you're ready. If the tank manages his cooldowns and survives? Great! If he doesn't?
---
Well, then that was a valuable lesson.
---

I sell Blackstone Ring runs, usually works out to 30-50g an hour if it drops. I've only had it not drop twice before lockout.

who is this guy anyway? im not familiar with classic streamers
---
Truefaith I dont consider being a lucky item to have tbh because you can buy the recipe on the auction house and just farm the mats out or like on my server the recipe and the mats cost next to nothing. Also tier 2 is almost guaranteed when you run onyxia week to week.
---
sadly Nature damage represents an absurd amount of flavours: earth magic, wind magic, lightning, poison, actual nature magic.
---
air elementals for example are immune too. and that lizard in wailing caverns for some fucking reason.
---
so im worried i am going to encounter arbitrary nature immunity in all sorts of places.
---
Woah dude, macros, same stuff people had on private servers, but with no artificial delay. I'm sure your anecdotes are 100% accurate. I'm sure you don't have posters of Ion Hazzikostas and Josh Allen plastered all over your room.
---
I'd be fine with what you describe in the last paragraph.
---
You gotta find yourself a guild where the mages aren't very good.  Or, just agony instead of elements so they lose their dmg boost and you get agony dmg to pad your own numbers.
---
And your assumption that he was talking about anything other than 5-mans says something about you, in turn.

Having the same issue atm

From my understanding the math is annoyingly complicated but you can treat it as effectively 3% hit with an upside.
---
Because usually they are doing it wrong
---
Play ruin spec
---
Lol. It hasn't been working for almost 30 minutes. Took a while for the first thread to pop up.
---
I literally haven't played the game in over a month. That's a silly accusation youre making, and I agree with him. It's a free market. Its why the AH exists. No one is forcing you to buy off the AH. Just as YOU were allowed to sell at a lower cost. 
---
Everything is only worth what someone else is willing to pay for it. And youre more than welcome to sell them at a lower price as you see fit. 
---
I am sure many people appreciate the original post on where to find it cheaper, but complaining in the comments about people using the AUCTION house for its intended purpose is asinine.
---
Pots are used in oh shit moments like that and not when you can predict SKT. What is the logic in having the one button that can save you not binded?

Making items BoE when you roll need on it is actually an interesting solution. So only people who roll greed will be able to sell them.  I like the idea.
---
Best thread in this sub yet.
---
Ty. Figured it was clearing the first room but I didn't think about the area above the arena and I sure didn't think I could get away with doing the arena event.  Maybe I'll give it a try though.
---
The chat window doesn't line up with the action bars. The vehicle button is in the chat window. The damage and threat meter aren't as wide as the quest tracker text and they dont  line up with the side action bar which itself I would have flush to the bottom right corner. Plus, holy mini-mqp buttons! Its all fine if that is how OP likes it I'm just saying I need things to be square.
---
They haven't announced it yet, but 2-3 months at least.

---
How about a Hunter with +10 to bows?
---
4% miss chance, so I need 3% hit?
---
Oh there's plenty.
---
There has to be dozens of tired, lame and worn out reddit inside jokes. Probably over a hundred.
---
As a mage I'm giving you .0000001 seconds to grab aggro and I'm going balls deep in frostbolts, cone of cold, fire blasts and any other method to keep me top DPS.
---
BETTER BE BLASTING!!!
---
This is awesome. Thanks
---
Shiro the cat approves
---
If you have 305 weapon skill, that means that you only need 6% more hit.  The to extra weapon skill would give you an additional 0.66% hit but you will still need +6% hit to avoid your yellow attacks missing.  So in essence, if you have the Edgemasters Handguards, you need an extra 6% hit (unless you have other talents or equipment that increase your weapon skill even further).
---
You should probably tell the other warlocks about that. Cause trust me, warlocks don't all feel the way you do. "It is the healer's duty to heal everyone in the party no matter what, even while they're life tapping" was something a warlock once told me.
---
Guess we are being way too patient.
---
Which class can farm/kill regular mobs the fastest/easiest/effortlessly at lvl60 with decent blue gear? Taking in comparison both killspeed and recovery time? Currently playing a healer but want something that can kill faster as an alt
---
Had a mage in vanilla back in the day because they could quickly kill shit and then recover fast with their free food/water. I realise Rogue or Fury Warrior can also kill fast, but how much % of hitpoints do you lose to a regular 58-60 mob? How often do you need to eat/bandage? How long can a hunter or warlock farm before they need a rest?
---
What he is offering is very different. He is saying if you roll need any item becomes BoP but if you roll greed the items stays BoE if its BoE or BoP if its BoP. Its a very good idea.
---
Thats still contributing.
---
Some people even like being able to semi-afk and earn honor/rep.
---
Tbh I completely understand it (as a healer!). Especially if there are mages in the group, a drinking party is one of the few times a tank can actually ensure he'll get more than 2 seconds to build aggro before people start AoEing. So long as he can handle himself until my mana's near topped, I don't begrudge him at all.
---
What class are you? I’m calling Warrior.
---
Healers are some of the best gold farmers. Priest can do diremaul farms easily, druid can farm Mara for 25g+ an hour. I don't play Shaman or paly so not sure how they do farming.
---
Was never anyone waiting besides me on earth fury.  Luckily only had to check a few times
---
You could totally be right, I don't know any of this first hand. BTW I'm a Shaman, so I take it, there is a bunch of Shaman optimized gear that became available in DM?
---
you don't wipe because one dps died. They aren't that important
---
Base crit chance doesn’t stay the same. It’s based on your agility. At higher levels you need more agility for 1% crit so your base agility didn’t quite keep up.
---
I will probably get flamed for this but, if you're not raiding you'll get run over by people with raid gear and most of the fighting will be done in squads, so although it's not super important for raid gear, it will be super important to be social and group up because it is going to be ugly. Blackrock will be camped, DM entrances will be camped, flight paths camped in certain zones, quest areas for 50+ such as WPL, EPL, Winterspring, Sillithus, Un Goro, etc.  
---
Even non-60s will want to get a few ranks for the PvP trinket at least so there's that too
---
You can do up to Golem at 52. 55 is required to clear torch room/emperor, but the rest of the dungeon can be done lower.
---
I’m for it.
---
For me the most time I wasted was traveling to main cities to do AH or learn class skills, forming dungeon groups, and professions... if you stay on task you’ll progress, just walk into a zone with a quest addon, do every quest, go to the next zone, etc setting realistic daily goals and staying on task for me was how I got level 60 just 2 weeks after launch without playing an insane amount
---
They can with ClassicCharacterStats.
---
Hunter
---
Being objective isn't "miserable and angry" it's just calling it for what it is. Shit. If they wanted the game to be good then they should stop being complacent with every God awful decision Blizzard makes lol
---
Badlands earth elementals are pretty decent GPH. SFK solo runs can also be worth it, as they also offer something 6-8 gold per hour, more if you're lucky with BoE's.
---
It's a mixed bag, like any gaming subreddit.
---
Get the fuck outta here
---
So while we're on the topic of monitoring mana, anyone got an addon that shows mana in the raid style party window?
---
And depends on their role. Raid healing, try to limit the overheals. Tank healing, well shit you have no choice keep those heals coming.
---
How much gold do you have stockpiled for raid consumes?
---
Tbc will be called classic as well.
---
Who doesn't remember distinctly that last time they sent a Cash on Delivery mail in game in the first days of playing to never again do so in 15 years.
---
Fair enough, but there is also something to be said about healers who wait to start drinking sometimes up to 60 seconds after a pack has been cleared. I'm trying to keep a steady pace through dungeons, and entitled healers make it very difficult to keep things running smoothly.
---
Bad tanks are a very big problem, and I agree that PUG's usually have to deal with tanks and healers that are on separate pages when it comes to downtime between pulls. As a tank, I take it upon myself to define the pace and decide when its appropriate to continue. 
---
Sometimes healers get upset with my speed, but I'm expecting you  to stay focused and manage your mana appropriately. If I'm using cooldowns to stay alive, you should be using cooldowns to maintain  mana. This is a 2-way street.
---
Sulfuras? I know a Dwarfpriest.
---
But I thought you couldn’t pay attention to threat? 
---
The point is don’t bitch about healing me when I don’t NEED you to heal me.
---
Not 100% sure on this, but I think base crit chance varies based on your agility compared to some standard, at which it will be 5%. Take off all your gear on your paladin, and see what your crit is. If it's less than 10%, then it's your base crit that's lower than expected. I'd love it someone more knowledgeable than I could answer this, however.
---
Yeah, let people play the expansion they preferred. It makes so much sense. You don't need 100 populated servers, even if it's just 1-2 for each expansion it'd let you pick and choose.
---
There is no console, it's just regular chat, like /whisper or /invite, those are "console commands" too. You don't need any flags or additional command line arguments.
---
/console commands only last for that game session and not all of them are noticeable, including weatherdensity (depending on your other system settings). If you want them permanent, you need to edit the CVARs in the config file.
---
Or you could just download [AdvancedInterfaceOptions](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/advancedinterfaceoptions) (make sure to get the Classic files), which will allow you to edit any and all CVARS in the game and check whether /console commands are actually working.
---
Ah, supply and demand at its finest.
---
I’m gonna need you to [...] clarify, because even though you think you’ve got a great point you do not.
---
The guy above you who told you not to listen to me is flat out wrong and the math proves it.
---
Ignoring any prot talents and d stance that multiply threat, battleshout causes 55 threat per person buffed for a total of 275 threat in a 5 man party (this is increased if you have a hunter/non phased lock pet in your group). This threat is then divided among the number of mobs currently engaged. So if we say it’s 10 with a 5 man party. You’re averaging 27.5 threat per mob per battle shout. 
---
Demo shout causes a flat 43 threat per cast. This means if there is a group of 10 mobs, you’ll do a combined threat of 430 with demo shout. Which makes it nearly twice as effective.
---
You should still tab target cleave to dump rage and tab hit autos to maximize threat
---
really? I dont believe that
---
We're entering Phase 2 after 2.5 months since launch. Phase 2's pve content has already been released and the next release is a couple world bosses + world pvp. There's not thought to be a lot of longevity to it, and rumours for when we'll see P3 are between a couple weeks to 3 months. 
---
It takes a very long time to level up (150+ hrs under good conditions). Starting now should get you geared for BG if they launch as early as 2 months from now.
---
You do know you can bubble outside combat then drink while the tank is pulling to get that mana back, right?
---
I did. I'm shaman heal and it's really annoying to heal a life tapping warlock since I don't have a quick, cheap hot that I could throw out every once in a while. But he tapped himself to &lt;30% hp and then oomed himself with dps spells. I just sat there like "congratulations, you played yourself"
---
I would've healed him more if we had a mage in the group who gave me water but I had to use my own water and he'd make me drink after pretty much every pull. So fuck him.
---
Price gouging would be buying up the whole supply and forcing everyone to pay more through you. The NPC won't sell out, so this is totally legit, even if the markup is huge.
---
Found the Paladin healing in raid as Ret
---
Use print screen to take a screenshot.
---
As a wizard I especially love when I'm oom and the tank pulls 5 mobs then gives me a "bro, you wanna do some dps?"
---
Yes,  I do. Let me just wave my wand harder, that should help.
---
It's still a consumable, so they will run out eventually.
---
Sure, use it it in rare situations.  I see your points but I dont agree.  I dont know how I've managed so many dungeons without being bubbled.  I think some healers wouldnt be casting a big heal on a dps with incoming  burst damage on the tank.  Which is really predictable in this game after you've run a dungeon once or twice.  I dont claim to be a healer but I can remember only 2 occasions where I was bubbled after maybe level 30, off the top of my head, and those were both prepull bubble spammers that stopped after I asked
---
EU servers down?
---
Going from 300 to 305 weapon skill gives you 3% hit. But then it takes going from 305 to 315 to gain an additional 1% hit. So your chance to miss should be 5.5%, but since hit is only in whole numbers on gear, you treat this as effectively 6%. And I don't know if ranged attacks suffer from glancing blows. If they do, than the extra weapon skill stops being a benefit at 308. If not, than 305.
---
Edit: Ranged attacks don't glance and aren't dodged. So 305 weapon skill is the only weapon skill you need to get nearly max benefit. It's easier to get an extra 1% hit than another 10 weapon skill, so just get 6% hit and enjoy never missing.
---
imagine not having fear ward or desperate prayer or a get out of blind free oof.
---
I used classicwow.live whenever I felt "lost" or like I didn't know which zone I should be questing/leveling in. Other then that you can LFG while questing in the area. Most groups take a bit to form so they will give you the 5min to cross the zone and get to the instance, once you do eventually find a group.
---
No one will pay the markup if they knew, now they know, too bad price gougers 🤗
---
Lot of spergs getting salty over a tip in here
---
I saw it drop 15 times before I got it
---
Just posting to say that waiting in line for the chicken sandwich at Popeyes today feels kinda like waiting on Qia to have a Pattern: Runecloth Bag
---
Me too
---
I don’t play this game I’m just trying to inform people that an item is sold by a vendor for 16s
---
I'd say 1-2 months personally, no one knows though
---
Dam I couldn't get the gloves but I went there and walked up and she had it lol I was just under the impression it was just a common stock item.  They got for 20-25g on my server for the pattern lmao
---
Wheee do they do 3x more Damage? What exactly does and affliction lock do in raids anyways? I just soak shadow bolt with corruption like every other lock and that can easily beat mage damage. Just depends on gear
---
It’s ‘Cash on Delivery’
---
If you jump on the pillar from the edge at 12:30, you can jump straight where the cave broke and avoid the 3 packs before the final boss. Enjoy the cristals :)
---
&gt;What you're gonna start seeing in the next 5-10 years is AI botting, which will get more and more human-like and eventually will be impossible to detect.
---
Imagine finding out someone you've partied, chatted and befriended was a bot. Gonna have to ask them captcha-like riddles to test them!
---
Some guilds might not take a holy/prot hybrid Pally for example, even if that healer can hold their own and do their job well. Some people like the benefit of privacy with how they build their toons. 
---
It might not be happening in MC, because it’s MC. But in BWL and on, even semi-elite guilds could force you to respec, regardless of the fact that you might be outperforming the other healers. They’re not wrong, but neither are you, and having that information withheld just gives people more agency.
---
Locks usually don't expect to get healed when they drain their life pool. And if they do they shouldn't. Don't heal a warlock when you have other people to heal.
---
This answer was way too far down
---
Also learn to love getting polymorphed and viper sting spammed, hehe.
---
In all seriousness, group with a mage. They're great peels, have water, and they will love you for pocket healing. Work very well together
---
Not saying he should, just said I know he wasn't in protection since he was using Ravager axe.
---
can't get on ashbringer
---
Why are you commenting on something irrelevant to you, then?  I’m informing people so they don’t get price gouged.  If you want to pay 5000% more for an item that’s on you.  Price gouging wouldn’t exist if more people were informed.  You not understanding that is absolutely ridiculous.
---
&gt;The vast majority of people who care about playing classic at all are level 60
---
That's not true, and not being level 60 yet doesn't mean a player is "ultra casual". That said, being lvl 60 doesn't make them a no-life nerd either.
---
The truth is somewhere in the middle. Keep in mind that the playerbase of Classic is older on average, which means that a lot of people playing have real-life responsibilities.
---
Good feedback! 
---
It sounds like it might work for me, since it won't be my main, and I can send cash/weapons.
---
Of course there’s no luck involved in truefaith, I don’t think he was talking about luck.
---
Yep Naxx dps looks like: Mage &gt; Warr &gt; Rogue &gt;= Lock
---
Here's a hint... you don't have to heal me the second I charge in. In fact, if all casting types would just sit the hell down and keep drinking for the first 5-10 seconds of the fight, I could maybe build up some threat.
---
Sincerely, your 57% damage reduction, 5 piece tier set tank.
---
You’re in for a treat when you learn how real world economies work.  What do you think the margins are for items in shops?
---
its that big brain phase 2 shadowmeld.
---
I feel like spell batching is in there to prevent kids like you doing dumb shit like that lol. Wahh I can't exploit wahhh
---
Finally got in after 30+ mins.   
---
To a gigantic queue. Nevertheless.   
---
Have a blessed Sunday.
---
There are no boomers with 1 year old children wtf are you talking about
---
And P2 for PVE servers won't add anything ATM. I think I've got a single honour kill despite having 20 days /played.
---
4 hours a day? You have to play at least 12 hours a day, EVERYDAY
---
even then it might be a safer bet to grind 14 hours everyday  non stop
---
There is like an overpopulation of healers lmfao I would never pay a healer I would only split for diremaul east runs as a duo or trio.
---
All right, we got off on the wrong foot here. I don't have an inherent problem with warlocks, and just *by eating food at all* you're pretty much a-ok in my books. My comment about "giving me water" was directed sarcastically at warlocks who tap and then do nothing at all - no bandages, no food, no drain life, nothing. If *those* kinds of warlocks gave me water at the start of the run, I wouldn't mind their behavior. After that, the eating + drinking response was just poking fun at your speed clear line, but I guess I touched a nerve.
---
I ran LBRS with 2(!) warlocks who hellfired *every* pull yesterday, but it was totally not a problem because they both brought and used a ton of consumables. It was so smooth in fact that we ran it twice in about the time of a single normal run, and I added them both afterwards. But these guys (and you) are outliers in my experience - there are a *lot* of selfish or lazy locks out there, and they can be a real pain to heal for.
---
Depends if they’re actually weighing you down... if you’re near the bottom of damage and you’re not being competitive, sure, but there’s degrees to it. 
---
For example, a firemage in MC? Yeah, no. A PvP oriented rogue spec that can do 70% of the damage of other rogues? Totally fine. And if it’s something you worry about holding people back with, bring extra consumed to make up for the guilt. It’s not black and white.
---
No it's not.
---
If you can't see 2 sunders on the mob, dot attack it. With the exception of specific dps check encounters, instances are not races and you shouldn't worry about winning dps meters.
---
So these guilds will just tell you to stop disabling the talents or you don’t go.
---
Economically, typically to price gouge you would need to have control of the supply to raise price above demand. Especially in say, an auction house. And the term is typically used to describe *forcing* someone to purchase a necessity at an extremely high price. 
---
Usually only in emegency or essential items do we consider price gouging to be unethical. Like water or gasoline. 
---
The problem here is you've stated it can come from a vendor in, presumably, unlimited supply?? So no one is being forced to buy from them. They have a cheaper option. Theyre choosing not to pursue it. 
---
Your use of the phrase price gouge seems inappropriate. 
---
Conversely, youre assuming the person selling it doesn't value it at 5g. Theyre putting a price saying "im willing to let go of this item for 5g. TO ME, it is worth 5g. And if it doesnt sell for that, I am okay with keeping it."
---
Yeah lots of boomers with 1 y/o children...........
---
Stay in school kids.
---
Nintendo DS
---
Either Enh Shammy or a Rogue, can't remember. But it was one of those two for sure.
---
You don't do city raids anymore and never group with people you can't trust.
---
Warriors in the UBRS first part who break los by charging behind a wall in those small rooms while everyone was drinking and get burned in 3 seconds.
---
HEALERS???
---
If I do 5 BRD Arena runs in an hour, I'll be locked out for instances. Does that mean I'm also locked out for Molten Core (for the next hour) or is that on a different timer?
---
Leveling a hunter at the moment, pet is a cat. Should I use bite or claw? Only worry about claw is that it drains all focus and doesn't allow for growl to be used off CD
---
If you are running the spec you're supposed to you have nothing to fear from people knowing about it.
---
Only dishonest people have to fear exposure.
---
Also met a bot few days ago, he got stuck multiple times at another spot trying to attack a mob [https://youtu.be/a9bGIFhgEl0](https://youtu.be/a9bGIFhgEl0)
---
Shops sell things I can’t manufacture myself.  Trying to compare that to walking to a vendor in an inn in wow is pretty ridiculous.  In fact, it’s an example of a fallacy - comparing two unlike things in an effort to make your point valid.
---
Depends on the mob but I usually just toss up a SW:P if it will get full duration. Otherwise I won’t damage beyond wanding. Use Heal 2 if you have enough +healing as it is most efficient. Rank up if he’s dying too fast.
---
Why Fury/Prot ahead of Arms/Prot?
---
I only ask cos I'm levelling as Arms / Prot and wondered why the switch.
---
Is there a Fury/Arms/Prot hybrid that utilises 5% Parry from Arms?
---
So make your own or downvote and move on. Calling for bans is childish.
---
I mean, he's tanking a dungeon that nobody wants to tank because of an infamous lack of tank drops, and the only thing he wants is a BoP cosmetic that most people don't care about.
---
I don't think this is unreasonable.
---
The only douchy thing is the lvl60 requirement, and that's not really that unreasonable either since the boss is lvl62.
---
How are chat window and action bars related to each other so as that they should line up? Same with damage meters and quest tracker. What, his buff bar doesn't line up with his bag icons? What an arbitrary selection.

Source?

Aye not a bad shout to get levelling and gearing now
---
You’re assuming everyone in the world knows it vendors for 16s.  That’s what I’m trying to inform, if you read my post.  A 5000% price hike on an item isn’t a gouge?  Is that what you’re really trying to convince me of?  You can never argue that you can’t buy this from a vendor for 16s so what else is there to know?
---
Just 1000 times in trade chat since this morning.
---
who from what?
---
Only arena in Classic is the one in STV an you would have to coordinate with people to meet you there if you want to throw down
---
What BGs can you play on current and next phase in classic?
---
Yes, there is also a Twitter message regarding this. 
---
https://twitter.com/BlizzardCSEU_EN/status/1191035128195305472
---
Alright take it on yourself to haul every profession recipe to the cities and resell them at vendor price. Keep this up indefinitely, I'm sure it'll make you feel better.
---
U having the same error message?
---
I'm on a layered server and it can take that long to find a tank too... So I level one on the side while I wait to find a tank for my main's group. Eventually, it will be fine.
---
Alts should come second anyway, so he should have checked. Plus if he was that sorry he could have just traded it to you for free.
---
I’ll just inform people when I see the need to a lot of people appreciate not being gouged by some bank alt fucko
---
&gt; No battlegrounds means a lot of cities will be raided
---
Doubtful.
---
More likely it means the leading guilds on both your server's factions will kill-trade.
---
40 man raid stands in a spot naked near a graveyard, gets AoE'd down, rezzes, dies again, etc. They swap who's dying and who's killing to prevent needing to wait on a rez timer. Do it 10 times for each raid every 24 hours. 
---
We've already got Thursdays setup on Bigglesworth for this between several guilds / known PVP-ers.
---
BGs Will be rushed because servers Will crash when big pvp battles happend
---
How does DHKs work?
---
I get that you dont wanna kill guards(?) or NPCs marked as "Civilians" does killing a grey level enemy count as a DHK?
---
How FriendlyAndPositive of you!
---
Or he's a paladin or shaman :P
---
Alright man, cheers for the heads up at least :)
---
Maybe BRD, but that's about it. There's no way you're going to raid tank without your entire guild supporting you, BRS, scholo, strat, and DM (aside from east) are also out of the question.
---
1. Takes longer than 5m to get to stonetalon/Hillsbrad and back to your city. 
---
2. You can earn more than 5g in 5 minutes. 
---
3. It’s not laziness if you have other things to do, and the 5 minutes is worth the 5 gold.
---
lol should try to context that you’re talking about the pet. Had to re-read the caption to figure it out because I’m on mobile but it seemed way more probable that you were commenting the guys skimpy outfit haha
---
What’s the most fun class 1-20 on alliance?
---
Context: my mains are all horde, but I want to quest in Westfall and DM for nostalgia. I don’t plan on playing the character much after I finish Westfall. 
---
Right now I’m leaning Warlock because I’ve heard they’re fun and I’ve never played one before. 
---
Thanks for any advice or insights!
---
Use stat potions and trolls blood potions. 
---
Buy the highest lvl hp pots you can get for your lvl.
---
Engi will help a lot especially with multiple mobs.
---
 Level up arms if youre not already. 
---
Dont execute until lvl 35. I found it isnt really worth it and its better to pool your rage for your next mob. 
---
Buy sharpening stones.
---
Save bloodrage for when you need to bandage. It keeps you in combat while youre bandaging so you have more rage for your next kill.
---
Use the beat bandage you can get.
---
Update your 2h every 5 lvls.
---
Enchant your gear. Str enchants are best along with movespeed. 
---
Stat prio: Str&gt;stam&gt;spirit&gt;agi. I dont value agi so highly because i like consistency. Others might be different.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LVGxduboxz
---
Thats how my build at 40 looks like. I did a few respeccs while leveling. Imp heroic strike is pretty good in the lower lvls but eventually you stop using it. Its up to you to decide what talents are good at what lvls. 
---
I have tactical mastery and anger management filled out but tactical mastery is kinda useless until you get berserking stance. 
---
Anger management is really good but not worth putting the 5 points into tactical mastery in the early lvls.
---
At around lvl 30 i found it best to spam sunders instead of using heroic strike but that is something youre going to have to feel out.
---
Leveling a warrior as a first character can be a pain but it should be disgustingly easy if you can pour money into it. If youre having trouble youre probably doing something wrong and sadly i cant see that. Hopefully some of the info here helps you.
---
Stay healthy
---
Warlocks/Hunters are the easiest if you just wanna experience the first 20 levels
---
Warlocks can get Imp by level 1, or 2? and Hunters get their pets at level 10
---
DHKs are only when u kill enemy NPC that has grey bar on frame NPCs that dont have this bar dont give DHK killing low lvl player doesnt give DHK either
---
Every raid group wants a handful of enhancement shamans, and resto is the strongest raid group healer horde side. There's definitely room for them at the more competetive side of the game.
---
So you'll do nothing. Ok good to know.
---
With the removal of layering and addition of pvp, what items will become harder to farm? What should I stock up on this week? I’m thinking elemental fire will shoot up in price after phase 2
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1jIMWlR3ns
---
This is how you can get your Imp at level 1, if you wanna give yourself and extra little challenge at the start!
---
I don't play priest, but you down rank spells to save mana by only healing what you need. If you wait 5s in between healing/spells you can get your mana regen going, so renew+sw:pain then auto untill tank is low and top them off again. If you can only keep them alive by spamming max rank spells then that's what you have to do. Also don't use bubble, unless the tank is about to die, its not very mana friendly and the warrior won't get any rage.
---
Or. Run your own game and sell the pattern for more money? Maybe? 
---
At least if people are too lazy to check wowhead, they're probably too lazy to read your Reddit thread.
---
Wow how boring. I'd honestly just crash the party and kill whoever without getting killed myself.
---
If the warlock gets a corruption debuff slot it may be very close to the dedicated ignite mage.
---
Maybe a week ago there was a thread on this very sub, I believe, something like "what class/race combo is a guaranteed ganker/asshole?"
---
Practically every combo was listed in the comments.
---
Nobody. You can only get it after BWL release.
---
And anyone who thinks this is likely also bad.
---
The game is objectively easier beyond the ignorance of the player base. This patch has improved talents, abilities and gear than what players were dealing with on launch.
---
No I don't have hardly any of it. I just want my mount. What are some other places I can farm? Preferably instances because of the imbalance on my server.
---
&gt;The type of person who would spit in a HK protester's face
---
LMAO this is the greatest troll account ever
---
People are reacting like this because we've already seen this post like 5000 times.
---
Not really related to what you're say, but bosses also have a 4.8% crit reduction, so you'll lose that as well.
---
No you are doing it perfectly for now. Justice is more pvp oriented and light is okay when raiding
---
Ohh ok that makes sense I thought he meant a like 20/31/0.
---
yeah lmao this guy probably doesn’t even use shadow-burn
---
That’s so lame. Sounds like a good party to crash
---
the guild i'm in has been really good about enforcing a no-bigotry policy, but the amount of people i've seen outside of it who love using the f-slur (either shortened, or the full version) and who throw fits when called out on it is just insane. it's a real problem in the Gaming community
---
edit i believe part of the problem is that a lot of people playing classic wow are older white dudes who haven't really progressed since 2004 or care enough to understand the feelings of others besides themselves, combine that with the patented alt-right strategy of passing off legitimate bigotry as humor so it's palatable to those types of people and.... yeah
---
You are using this phrase wrong ^(just saying)
---
Right on bro we need more gamers like this.
---
Sure, 40 Horde and 40 Alliance all in the same private Discord channel coordinating Honor Farming with no announced location, time, etc. And NO streaming allowed. Even if you find them, you're just going to die and get trolled by your own faction.
---
Good luck with that. This is the birth of the rank coalitions that will control who gets the most CP every single week. You're either part of their crew or you might as well give up hope of any rank above 10.
---
fuck this is so good
---
You need to mind control a goblin in BWL to craft elementium bar
---
Horde are too busy escorting their low level friends through Stranglethorn because they need their hands held.
---
There really is no such thing as " affliction warlocks" that isn't SM Ruin outside of dark pack spec while leveling. If someone is 60 and raiding or even doing dungeons without ruin they're doing it wrong. This ain't TBC where there is actually an affliction spec without ruin
---
Mehh might report them though. Pretty sure this is a reportable offence.
---
Trashy
---
It is unfortunate that there isn't much in terms of "freshness" or "surprises" with this game, but it's just a fact that we live in the age of information now and just about any piece of game knowledge can be found on the internet. Especially for a 15 year old game with an insane amount of items, quests, and objectives, it goes without saying that things would be documented over time.
---
So there really isn't anything that can be done about this, it's just the world we live in now. I still strongly enjoy this game and I'll admit I use websites like Wowhead myself. I don't mind that though, I like looking through different pages and learning more about this game to help boost my understanding to better help myself and other players. I use my information as an asset when needed, and I'd rather interact with other players about tactics and strategy with such things than play retail where you're closed off from everyone else and everything is spoon fed to you.
---
It depends on what you're looking for out of this game, but in this day and age the only real way to experience games truly "blind" is to deliberately avoid anything about it on the internet or play it immediately upon release. With a game like an MMO that's existed for 15 years, with millions of players and it being always online, it is truly impossible to avoid. Especially when considering that so much of Vanilla WoW is built around interaction with other players, there's really only so much you do solo without your experience being "tainted" with everything being known and discovered already.
---
Hello, I was thinking of leaving Shazzrah because of the massive faction imbalance for horde and other reasons (all guilds i joined died, so I was lvl 58 completely alone, making it extremely hard to find a group for anything at that level), and was wondering what EU server would people recommend as i'm looking for a new home to begin another journey.
---
I had started a character on Earthshaker, and saw so few people in Org at peak hour so i guess i'll go to a "Layered" server to make sure there's plenty of people.
---
Everything could become harder to farm, Essence of Water, Essence of Air, Felcloth, just about everything i think
---
Then that’s how you choose to play. I’d rather enjoy myself and not play with players who think a lvl 34 non resto specced Druid can’t heal sm lib.
---
Just a heads up though, very few people have that mentality. So yeah, it’s not like you’re “never going to run SM”
---
No you're not wrong, supply and demand applies.
---
Yea why didn't your whole group need? I wouldn't really say they are a ninja any more than you are naive in rolling greed on a BoE
---
People begged for no changes. 
---
So this is what we have. I don't want to even really play it anymore because of this. I was so hyped for classic... 
---
But honestly I am learning very quickly that I just dont have the mindset/mentality to keep up with this generation of MMO gamers. 
---
ESPECIALLY these "private server veterans" that are all the guild masters and officers that want to dictate how everyone plays but arent actually putting in the time to help them out when they need it.
---
Ah, you can say that because you're not too bright. Gotcha.
---
Cross faction collusion is a reportable offence
---
Use quest addon Questie, it Will show on Map where questgivers are and req level, and not to run across different zones too much. Google a req zones for each level so you know where to gather up quests.
---
Read a solid class guide, beginner friendly, maybe on Classic head.com To know what things your class can do and what to look for
---
No he could counter offer you and just move on.....
---
I always see conflicting reports on this. Some people say it isn't. Some people say it is.
---
It should be, though, in my opinion. It's circumventing game mechanics (in this case through 3rd party apps like Discord to coordinate it) of not being able to communicate with the opposite faction.
---
The other commenter that replied to u/Mad_Maddin says that it isn't.
---
Very very often I see the casters sitting and drinking like 20s after a fight and I haven't dropped combat for some reason.
---
Gear? And how'd you even lose money running dungeons, tank warriors might lose money if they wipe a bunch of times, which is why first Orb reserve is an acceptable practice during runs; and 6 stacks of Crystallized can last you 2-3 dungeons on full run, and that's in the worst case scenario of your party not having at least one mage. 
---
Why are you even looking to get gold from doing dungeon runs outside of DMEJR/DMT anyway? There are plenty of ways of getting gold as a healer, being cheap in dungeons isn't one of them.
---
the issue is his whole guild is a cult of a personality around him. they're a zerg guild and they just run around saying "HAIL HORRIGAN!" over and over.
---
Good info. Also I've noticed that I resist it a lot on my orc as I think my 30% chance to resist stuns woks on the sacrifice.
---
Well then everyone can contribute to every BG.
---
I dont expect it ever but when the healer just keeps healing me up, well... i need mana... and life tap is just right there... what do they expect???
---
You only get honor for killing someone 4 times within a 24 hour period, and it’s reduced each kill.
---
Please just tell that person. Don’t let there be a culture of silence around warlock heals
---
Does pope shit in the woods?
---
A brief overview.
---
Crusader is great for increasing the damage of your other seals and judgments which deal holy damage. Just like you're doing. A lot of guides don't recommend it because it is extra mana, but I've never gone oom having that in my rotation.
---
Righteousness is good for dealing damage. Pretty basic. While questing you'll want a 2h weapon though as its holy damage depends on weapon speed.
---
Justice is situational. Strictly when in a situation where if the mob runs it will cause more trouble. When I use this I only do right before they flee which is at low health ~10-20%.
---
Light/Wisdom. Really only need to judge light in groups where multiple people will benefit from the healing. Or in a group with a paly tank, you can use wisdom to help them with mana regen (depends if your other melee have mana to decide if that is better than JoLight in that situation).
---
Wisdom can be useful in solo content if you are low on mana and extra mobs pull, for example, to get mana faster for heals if things go south.
---
Some Holy palys will spec ret up to Seal of Command which is the absolute best deal by far for damage. I've hit some large crits with Hammer of Justice, Judgment of Command combos and when your seal procs before you do that or after, you can obliterate mobs. I've nearly killed mobs my level with double procs and the combo above with some crits. Not common, but makes leveling Holy easier. 
---
I would only recommend Seal of Command if your primary leveling tactic is solo questing. If you are in a group questing or doing dungeons it isn't worthwhile.
---
Huh? All cats have claws. Unless your cat is a clawing mf all the time I wouldn't worry about it tbh.
---
My cat does this regularly and I haven't had any problems so far.
---
Leveling ranged skill?
---
can confirm this works. Play with bad mages, sneak in your corruption, and volunteer to be the reck curser so you're helping the melee players instead of the mages
---
Im intrested in more of pvp side. pve is boring and pretty easy for me
---
Hey all I was wondering what dungeons I can grind from 54-60 kinda getting tired of the questing and just wanna grind on area.. thanks all
---
Just play a druid, people either learn or don't, and there's nothing you can do about it anyway!
---
Sooo evil of you XD
---
thank you! I'd love to see a video of a warlock doing the solo method, seems pretty interesting.
---
I literally don't understand why 3 day long AVs were a problem, that shit was epic as fuck.
---
If you want honor/hour do wsg or ab
---
You can heal yourself as a warlock. Warlocks do need to life tap. Healers do not need to heal them. Raid groups do need to communicate strategy when in doubt.
---
So you're saying since I don't want to raid... stick to PVE server?
---
Dwarfpriest? I know a Dwarf Priest.
---
Whats the name of ur energy-tick addon? I've been looking around for one and found nothing.
---
thank you!
---
char name?
---
Your a monster!
---
Babby's first script, imagine losing to game geometry, stupid robot.
---
I mean, they aren’t wrong. They are using lua scripts that take advantage of the same API that addons and macros use.
---
It's great if your class has stealth.
---
I dont need any gear that comes from 5 mans anymore perhaps ?
---
So what're you bitching about then?
---
just join a good active guild that helps out its players when they are getting camped/ganked and form groups to roll around in when p2 starts, that's probably your best defense IMO
---
[They are?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpyiGE26pd8)
---
Because it's none of your goddamn business, and I don't want some GM telling me how to play.
---
VIP discord...lol
---
Now it's not.
---
I've never understood this way of thinking. They knew this existed, they know this will happen. So leaving it in the game is by choice. If it was such an issue that they see as an offence that requires banning they view this as hurting the game integrity.
---
So the question then becomes
---
Does it hurt the games integrity more to add code to remove this?
---
Or leave people to abuse it and just try their best to ban people, which can lead to false bans like weve already seen. 
---
In my opinion the latter is the worst possible choice to take.
---
So then that begs the question why even make it a bannable offence if you dont want to change it? 
---
In my opinion.
---
1. Leave it in the game, no bans.
---
2. Remove it. 
---
The least rational option would be to leave it in the game for people to abuse,but ban them as best as possible. If we are at the point of banning, just remove it.
---
Grats on your 9g
---
You ain’t doing something right, son.
---
I did. I told him I won't extensively heal him. That's when he said "don't worry, I don't need heals" and then kept on failing over and over again.
---
this is hilarious, such great editing. 10/10
---
&gt;Want to still be gaming long hours for the rest of your life? If so, don't try to hotkey all of your abilities, or you'll have fucked up hands like me.
---
Ok... right.
---
Download AtlasLoot addon and it will tell your dungeon level ranges and items from said dungeon. That being said you can do Dire Maul, Blackrock Depths, LBRS, and maybe UBRS depending if you find nice people.
---
Jeff specifically said OW2 is not using a new engine.
---
He went so far as to say something like "I want to stress that it's not using a new engine."
---
It's the same engine but "improved"
---
Thanks for the comment bro :) got some more here on my youtube if you missed any https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCgdyswgFk7pcF6SFcNaWthA
---
My main is actually a hunter - do warlock it is! Thank you for helping me decide :)
---
Agreed, I do think there’s gonna be a hefty amount of people who associate MCs current standing with how Classic raiding will be though.
---
Time will tell
---
Good question lol. I recently learned after making the video that you can skip them. Will be doing that on stream tonight!
---
Yeah it’s to early, but that won’t stop blizz. I imagine they planned it simply to keep people’s subscriptions going. Though a lot of my friends are all done with pve content and are ready for some pvp. If I wasn’t releveling on a different server I’d be ready for it as well.
---
You're assuming that a static available price is the same as a convenience price. Same reason things are more expensive at a convenience store than a walmart. Convenience. 
---
You seem to be completely failing to understand that time is worth money. 
---
People see the vendored price and can either go "woah, im not willing to pay that." And find out how to get it themselves. Or "eh im sure i can get it less than that, but fuck it." 
---
Im arguing that your understanding of very basic economics is very, very poor.
---
Dropping a link to your stream is one thing but this is just ridiculous.
---
Farm an alt pre bis. For me I’m a mage so I got most my frost bis and now I’m lookin for fire bis. Also farm rep to get those sweet patterns or transmute
---
This sub is full of boomer casuals. I'm raid geared I'm not just gonna go do dungeons for fun, but ask for money and people will vilify you
---
I see, thank you for the explanation.
---
Might as well go full alliance and try paladin.
---
Thanks! Warlock it is!
---
Ty :D
---
That's a smart move, I'll try that out next time with the barov peasant caller trinket.
---
"I want an authentic Vanilla experience, except the parts I don't like. Let's change that one thing and THEN it will be a better vanilla."
---
A small change after small change is how we ended up at retail.
---
If you want changes, go to retail. There's a lot about vanilla I would change to make my perfect game. But I don't want or seek to make those changes, because then it wouldn't be classic.
---
Classic is an authentic, VANILLA experience.
---
No changes.
---
Haha, I'm glad you liked it bro
---
????
---
From the comment he replied to:
---
&gt;The other 14 benefit a spell I cast 5% of the time by my last MC parse.
---
You are aware of what 'MC' is, right?
---
It's 10 kills within 24 hours, not 4.
---
1st kill = 100% CP
---
2nd kill = 90% CP
---
3rd kill = 80% CP
---
4th kill = 70% CP
---
5th kill = 60% CP
---
6th kill = 50% CP
---
7th kill = 40% CP
---
8th kill = 30% CP
---
9th kill = 20% CP
---
10th kill = 10% CP
---
So killing a 40-man raid 10x is worth 220 first-time HKs *before* you count the raid bonus.
---
Not anymore.
---
I sell the fuck out of rune thread lmao
---
Are there any add-ons that will tell me how much time is left on a teammate's status, assuming it's something I initiated? Resto Druid, looking for something that'll help me cast Swift-mend at the right time.
---
Fairly easy. Kill 10 people a day for 2 weeks or so and you'll get it.
---
Thank you for supporting me my man :D
---
I agree. This is how I do it because I don’t use pots enough so I have like 10 skills that take priority. Skills that are extremely situational and require and second nature to use. Pots don’t require the same thought. It’s oh boy I’m going down fast. If you know where they are it’s not any slower. They just don’t need to a hotkey like everything else.
---
&lt;3
---
I changed my bottom left action bar to be bound to shift+1-9 for this function
---
Very gently, put a pillow over the player’s face and whisper to them that it will soon be over
---
Ah ok, I thought it was 4.  Thanks for the info.
---
It scales based on PvP rank, not based on Level.
---
Havnt really played a rouge but as i understand rouges get  1ap/str so with crusader yiud get about  7dps increase whenever it is up. Which would be around 12 extra dmg per hit on a perd (1.8 speed) comparing to +5 i would prefer it tbh. 
---
The Dps increase also applies to your offhand so you get even more benefit from it anyway. Havnt tested +5 wep dmg but im.guessing that it only applies to the wep you have it enchanted on. If thats the case i would say double crusader is the better option since you can get +200 str which will increase the dmg you do with both weapons and any dmg increase to your mainhand increases the dmg of any abilities that are based off of it.
---
The downside to crusader on a dagger is that theybare generally really fast and crusader is a ppm based proc so you will proc it less reliably. Still think its the better option.
---
I guess you could mentioned that you press Arcane Power every 3 minutes, but if you're a full frost mage (which many people are so they can farm ZF) then it's frostbolt time.
---
Not as easy as farming 100 gold
---
As a new mage alt. Fuck didnt realize this. Going to look into more mage tips.
---
I think your viewpoint is super skewed because you play over 12 hrs a day. P2 launching is fine, but the issue is what is launching P2. World dragons basically aren't content at all for 99.5% of folks because they'll never get a chance to down them on these mega high population servers. They should add at least WSG. There is no good reason not to.
---
Kill em all! :)
---
Lol what? There is an over abundance of players for guilds right now. Non zerg guilds that have their 40 core man group can easily replace a person or two if they're toxic or fucking up a bunch. If a guild is going to strict about spec's and you don't like it leave. If they're going to be strict about specs then hiding your spec isn't going to help you.
---
I don't agree with the person saying it's "selfish" in general but I mean yeah, if you're in a guild that is gonna enforce specs then it actually is a dick move and it won't help you.
---
Of course there were dual hellfires, what do you think they life tapped so much?
---
But why?
---
A pull shouldn't start with DPS taking agro.
---
And yes, you can also gheal + renew and drink before going into combat as well.
---
If you max range your heals, you can sometimes STAY out of combat while drinking. But its wonky.
---
Judging crusader while grinding single mobs probably works out to a net loss in damage.  It basically comes down to whether the bonus damage on each swing will outweigh having an additional chunk of damage.  Once you get holy shock or using exorcism against undead this could swing the balance.  Just keep in mind crusader is not always the best first option especially for shorter fights.  Play it by ear and go for whatever feels smoother to you.  After a little bit you'll be able to determine when it is and isn't a good time to judge crusader on mobs.
---
Righteousness is gonna be your bread and butter for damage dealing with a 1h/shield setup, also the best seal to use while tanking.  
---
Light/Wisdom have kinda the same the implications as crusader, judging them while farming single mobs likely won't be worth it.  Seal of Wisdom is also useful for AoE grinding/tanking since it will offset the huge mana cost of consecration and you can afford to not have the damage boost during pulls like that.  In a raid setting however judgement of light and wisdom are incredibly powerful debuffs and scale very nice as you add more players and the encounters get longer.  Good chance your raid leader will have someone assigned to keeping them both up at all times.
---
Justice is pretty useless.  It is helpful during the paladin epic mount quest as there is a specific mechanic that triggers when you judge it on one of the waves.  It has some very tiny utility in 5 mans to keep mobs from fleeing in terror when they are near death.  If you are having issues with fleeing mobs pulling additional packs this is a solution though there are many better ways of avoiding that.  Probably isn't even worth a slot on your bars.
---
Lastly there is seal of command.  It is mostly reserved for 2h weapons and has very similar uses to righteousness.  It is important to note the seal and judgement of command both behave as melee attacks.  What that means is they crit for double damage and use you physical character stats, like your hit%, crit%, etc.  As a holy paladin with a shield equipped this seal has virtually no use and isn't worth spending talent points on.
---
Okay so probs gonna get hate from the min/maxers, but I've got a level 60 warrior currently specced fury and it's not doing it for me.  I really like warrior and dont want to reroll but what I really want is shield slam.  I dont know why but I fucking love that ability.  If I were to create a prot dps build would there be any issue with shield slam generating too much threat because it says it generates a high amount, obviously I would avoid any talents which increase threat from the prot tree.
---
But if it's linked then you can see which stage?
---
Engi nades/sappers, scorch/fb when you can't cast a Frostbolt, diff AoE scenarios, sheeping in ZG later on, swapping gear sets for single target and aoe scenarios, etc.
---
Trying to save face is the wrong idiom to use here. It would imply I have a reputation to uphold. Which I do not.
---
And because I find supply and demand applications interesting when outside of traditional means. It's almost like I picked a profession that I enjoy! However, your understanding here is very flawed. Many of these people are correct. You will notice no one is taking your side in these arguments. There's a reason for that. And it isnt because this entire subreddit is pro-"price gouging."
---
Should really be  
---
"Tank: Just approached the boss"  
---
DPS:
---
Maybe I got confused in the process somewhere lol, are you just deleting a level 60 toon to try this, or am I misunderstanding. Just curious
---
Recount is awful
---
This, but the very opposite
---
Your reasoning is akin to "marijuana isn't that bad and should be legal therefore *all* drugs should be legal".
---
In what way do you mean obsolete? Because you think they won't give you good loot or because you think you can't participate in them with a PvP spec?
---
If i get the time to write (sometimes you don't because they rush, see the picture of this thread) i will tell them, and again and again. Then when i get tired of that i just let them fall.
---
Depending on how much of a bother they are, Bubble + Hearth
---
You forgot the hots on yourself fo dat extruhhh aggro maaan
---
As a behind the curve level 40 hunter, this scares the shit out of me. I can't make it to 60 before p2 and I'm sure I will never get to 60 after p2 and before p3.
---
Lol. Well done I spit out coffee
---
OR (this might be crazy) it's hyperbole.
---
Telisa or Talisa? Might be 2 Ls
---
Could be arcane/frost spec, which doesn't include ice block.
---
Where's the troll? I exclusively speak in an objective sense.
---
Iam helping you run the dungeon in half the time of a pug tank . Iam 7/8 in t1 gear I don’t need shit from dungeons I need money for a lion hearth helmet . Why is it the game going downhill ? Running a dungeon is a chore if I only have 1-2 hours to play  why would I run a dungeon for a change of getting 2-3 greens that I might not even get cause of rng. People are smarter and time is way more important . Hey if your idea of having fun is waiting 5 hours for a tank that’s up to you Iam tanking to make money not to wipe in dungeon and make mabye 10g - 4g in repairs.
---
Tanks have lives we also want epic mounts we also want lion hearth helmet get used to the idea. The faster you realize tanks won’t do it for free after bis the better cause this is not controversial it’s supply and demand running strat 60+ times is not fun unless u getting money.
---
Also back in vanilla people did it know shit about the game and people where bad and people where younger tanks have lives now sorry we need gold we have our gear u want to get your gear fast simple pay for a tank. It’s not like mages locks hunters priests shamans and basically every other class can’t afford to give boe green drops to a tank. If anything it’s the greed of people that don’t want to pay for a tank that makes the community go downhill lmfao .
---
Yes
---
Classic is not on the tbc patch
---
The one you have now will cast Hunter's mark when not pressing shift, and Hunter's mark + rapid fire when pressing shift. You can't do that due to gcd.
---
You will need this;
---
``#showtooltip [mod:shift] rapid fire; Hunter's mark
---
/cast [mod:shift] rapid fire; Hunter's mark``
---
I would also suggest you to add a opener macro with /petattack
---
Like
---
``#showtooltip auto shot
---
/Cleartarget [dead]
---
/Targetenemy [noharm]
---
/Cast !auto shot
---
/Cast Hunter's mark
---
/Petattack``
---
That looks like NugEnergy. I use that with NugComboPoints. They put the bar there and the CP one adds a 5-light bar underneath. All I really need now is a decent swing timer, haven’t found a good one yet
---
&gt; Some people really got a downvote boner for this one
---
Because what you said is stupid.
---
That is so weird man. I doubt you’re gonna pull any significant threat with prot if that’s the only threat generating ability you’re doing.
---
&gt;we can *easily* return it to the other bar if needed. ( drain/syphon life, deathcoil and health Stone)
---
Except life tap, life drain and syphon are resource neutral, so by tapping and draining you don't actually gain anything(unless you have +shadow damage, wich you don't while leveling). And death coil and HS have to crit to be a net positive, wich is inconsistent and can easily amount to nothing due to over heal. 
---
Not to mention while you're shuffling around your health/mana for virtually no gain, your damage will be absolute shit. And you can't significantly damage more then one target.
---
The most reasonable and smooth way is to have the healer heal the tapping warlock while they can, and have BOTH drink(and eat) when necessary. A warlock not bringing water and food to a dungeon is an asshole, but a healer not healing a warlock at all is not doing their job, and punishes the entire group with slower progression by being petty.
---
I'm glad you brought that up. Dota has an extremely high skill cap. It takes skill to be a pro. It takes skill to win in that game. The r14 grind is none of these things. What skill is there in playing 12+ hours a day and grinding bgs that you lose half the time? What incentive in the r14 grind is there to make me want to get good at pvp? None, because that grind doesn't take skill, it takes time, and that is the inherent flaw in the system. No skill, just time. You don't even have to be good at pvp. Just admit that it's a bad system, not everything in classic was amazing and even though I'm usually part of the no changes crowd, I'll make an exception to the r14 grind.
---
The ones with his imaginary friends on his dead server.
---
This a video game, your likening circumventing game rules to drugs that kill people or literally ruin your life. If the level of circumventing game mechanics becomes as serious as an issue as death, then we should whole heartedly ban people. But joining a discord to kill each other = legalization of all drugs, wdf? 
---
This couldnt be more apples to oranges.

Economics is essentially the study of money and how its used in a market. This is literally a post about economics. 
---
There is nothing immoral about ASKING for a high value of an item you bought for less. This holds especially true in non-essential or emergency items that can be found elsewhere. Because no one is being forced to buy it at the asking price.
---
&gt; apples to oranges
---
But you can still compare them.
---
Just join a party, set loot to FFA, and set the threshold to rare. 
---
If you don’t want to have a stranger in your party, invite a friend, have them invite your alt, and then the friend can leave the party. This also helps with resetting instances!

WSG can easily get in a situation where your team has 0 chance of killing the opponent flag carrier and you contribute nothing.

I am from euw and when i started playing the word cancer specifficly was used for everything in my region it is so fun that you bring this up specifically i never even minded using it for me and everybody i played with we understood it wasn't sirius from all the peopel that played back then most stopped because it just started being restricted by kids even when amonh friends we flame each other for jokes and we tell those kids we are in party they report you none the less that is why it is a plague for the game they kame it a safe space, playing this season i noticed that most people are new players just look at how the ranked system works these days bad players are rewarded to much because they need to have fun  so maybe this was just you taking it personal when random people online are talking to you but this in not a single game ever was a problem until games had to become a safe space for kids
---
You have a perpetual battleground in brm right now. If pvp were your goal, this is the golden era that will be destroyed when bgs come out and people sit in cities waiting in queues. This era of world pvp will never exist in wow history, so your argument is just ridiculous to me.
---
The fact people need "ranks" or whatnot to incentivize them to pvp is a reflection of how boring those people are as people. What happened to just pvping for... fun? People have been playing dust 2 in cs for 20 years just killing each other over and over again. They don't need a rank to get them to do that. This is a world, you can create your own content. The concept of "not enough end game content" is purely from your lack of imagination, not because there's any lacking of content. I pvp every time I log on. Every moment is special and unique and under different circumstances.
---
hahaha you got that right ! XD
---
That’s a dick move. That’s a greed roll and he’d never be in another group with me.
---
They are both round and a fruit but otherwise completely different. Comparing the two is fruitless.
---
I have Mask of the Unforgiven so yes
---
in Onyxia you literally just cast frostbolt, anything else is overkill and aoe isn't needed on the whelps unless someone messes up and pulls too many. Your best dps rotation is just frostbolt, if you want to count literally everything pressed from the start of the run to the end then there's conjure water / food, decurse, dampen magic, intellect, mage armour ect ect. I was just pointing out the dps rotation for a frost mage is just frostbolt because the person above mentioned how all classes play the same, but just spamming frostbolt / shadowbolt / mindflay isn't any better.
---
TSM will show you what you need will also show if a alt has it in the mail or posted on the AH

This is about the execution context meaning about the "when" variables are passed rather than the "where" variables are passed.

does every Fem Troll have the same  hair and face combo?
---
Using discord to find and chill with your cross faction friends does not affect the realm as a whole. Colluding to farm PvP ranks *does* affect the community as there are only so many people allowed in each bracket. Not to mention it simply goes against the spirit of competitive wpvp. 
---
Your hypothetical scenarios don't seem bannable but the main issue of cooperative honor farming definitely should be.
---
So can priests still mind control someone of the enemy faction, and put fortitude on them ?

Now THAT'S pure evil.

Yeah my guild requires details for tiny threat and it really is the best threat meter out there right now. I am loling at all these bad people in this thread that think hiding their spec is going to make a difference. If a guild cares you're gonna have to get details anyways.
---
As someone travelling through low level zones at the moment in order to level mining - yes. Did it many times.
---
They can but unless they have horrible gear they really shouldn't so long as they make sure they always drink when they have a chance and position themselves properly
---
I didn't mean to judge, just wanted say that I think it's plausible that a lot of players are only motivated by rewardsand thusly will have nothing to do if they play a lot.
---
You wipe because you foolishly heal the warlock and then run out of mana to heal the tank
---
\&gt; In Onyxia
---
An instance with one boss and single trash mobs. And you'll still be doing MC right after or it's just been completed. 
---
Either way, you'll definitely be AoEing in split Ony runs, and you'd still cast a scorch/fb at the very end when you can't get a frostbolt off.
---
No .  It’s not telling when it’s the straight up truth.
---
Did you mistake the classic sub for the retail sub?
---
Please post the exact macros that aren’t working and I’ll look. 
---
Also, please explain the issue again. Are you saying your helpful skills won’t cast on friendly targets? Does it not cast at all? Does it cast on you instead?
---
And no one wants to pay your sorry ass either.
---
I can't tell if you're a troll or just really far on the spectrum.
---
Because that games more for you.
---
Is it worth taking enchanting on a druid for the trinket or should I do something like mining + skinning for the money?
---
That’s it retail boi.  You do you.
---
This
---
Those are the only two BOP items, the others you can buy on the AH whenever
---
As a healer, if I see a tank trying to use any part of this argument I’ll just go find another group. I’d rather heal an undergeared tank than someone that thinks they’re special.
---
Tanks are replaceable.
---
That's exactly correct. The only thing I have considered is farming a ton of money for the later phases but it doesnt seem worth it for the time I would need to invest.
---
They do lol I have lots of repeat customers in the weekend it’s awesome too I can run strat live and make 100-300g in 3-4 runs I sometimes get 2 orbs with luck.
---
Nope
---
Only because blizz left us out to dry only PvP server for oc before classic went live then it took them hours to role out additional servers to fix the population issues
---
Ahhh I see thanks!
---
Yes I deleted my 60 toon

Even in MC it's not uncommon for bosses to take like 2 minutes in pugs.

Your entire comment literally reads:
---
"My time is more valuable than yours. My stuff matters more than everyone elses. I deserve this more than you"
---
And this is why people hate it. 
---
Everyone else has lives. Everyone else is saving up for things, too. 
---
This is entitlement. The group functions when everyone works together, and the community only got here because everyone started acting entitled.
---
Did you just assume their gender?!?!?!?
---
MINE!
---
You contribute it a way or another unless you are entirely AFK.
---
It stuns your target
---
It's true.
---
Considering all but one of the female troll faces are butt-ugly hags, and there's really only 2 or 3 good hairstyles, yeah.
---
Alliance nerd
---
The one and only. I should’ve known someone would recognize me from this.
---
Sometimes it’s the littlest mind fucks that are the most effective.
---
This is also assuming no extra mobs are being pulled by the dps or tank, the mage in the group hasn't gone full AoE super saiyan and pulled aggro, and the warlock isn't life tapping himself into oblivion midway through a large pull...
---
It matters in the context of the comment I was replying to. And yeah I can see it being a potential issue when an addon is sharing your (normally private) information without permission.
---
What character level do I need to be to max a profession, specifically leatherworking? More specifically, I want to level an alt to craft Hide of the Wild.

Very few go holy, but even then, some do go just to holy nova so they can “farm”*
---
* that said, don’t do it.  Nova w/o the deep support of pi in disc or the tier 25 buffs in holy just does shit damage and runs oom too fast to work prior to seriously high end gear.
---
Consuder respec to arms, way better for PvE
---
All I said was that it's not an odd reason.  Releasing them in the order they were implemented should not be considered "odd".
---
I'm at Firemaw and we have a huge population and balanced factions, but ofc queues are a problem. I heard Dreadmist is nice as it has a decently sized population and never having a queue, and it also feels like dreadmist has a bit more allys than hordes.
---
I wish, maybe then I can afford one.
---
I always had to leave the MC raid half way through because of work, so I’m really happy I was able to finish the raid finally lol. I started playing wow about 6 months before TBC release so I didn’t get to enjoy the vanilla raids until classic :)
---
Where do I respec as a horde Druid?  The moonglade and ferealas trainers don’t give me an option to do so!
---
It's what pvp is in gaming otherwise people wouldn't play it. If I didn't love shitting on people I wouldn't have played League of Legends so long.
---
That’s what they want us to be like- non layered realms are full on like this always and it’s a pita.
---
Fun for me is seeing progress in my character or my metrics on a website that I can see evidence of actually improvement. I dont pvp in brm because people arent trying to engage in pvp there they are trying to do a dungeon or level there character or get a felstriker to drop. They arent going in wanting to fight so it's just picking on players who are indifferent. I need competition. I need rules. I dont just try and dick over every person I come across because I dont get anything from it.
---
Tanking is a service my friend you have to lead a group of pugs. Who can make you wipe and cost you money as a tank . Also it may read like that but when Iam saving you 30-40 mins cause I use iron grenades and pots to run you faster cause Iam a fury tank you will see that you are saving Time and money in the long run as a dps/ heal . But I guess you don’t think your time is important since you prefer to wait 1-5 hours looking for a tank when you could have gotten your bis way before that time frame.
---
No ones doing this and risking their account getting a perm ban...
---
dwarf priests, the best of the best
---
I went back to Mara after getting all my items from Tribute because I like a gold farm I can relax and half afk to instead of one you have to be playing at your best for. Tribute is only worth it if you master it and never die. Too many BS things can happen while skipping trash there.
---
Who would thought that, a PC baby from Texas. Guess it's getting worse in the old U.S of A.
---
A friend and I did a Mage + Priest combo.   Priest kept us healed and Mage blasted away.   Leveling through quests went very quickly.    I suspect there are other good leveling duos
---
In cities.
---
Yeah I have been checking both factions out and the metric I use is "items on AH". Seem to be 50/50 with perhaps a slight alliance lean.
---
It's all fun and games until the claws come out!
---
Literally never seen your guild before. Must be a really small guild
---
Not even close. I’d suggest trying it if you’re a fan of the genre.
---
Yes they totally are just like healers plenty plenty plenty of those lmfao. Where it takes 5 mins to find a healer it takes 1 hour at least to get a tank. It’s just about how important time is for you .
---
Here's the problem: you are putting all of the blame on tanks. You are just as involved as they are, and not all healers are prepared for even the most thought-out pulls at 100% mana. When it gets to a point where we're all waiting on the healer to fill his mana while everyone else is ready to go, I will not wait for the healer to leisurely drink to full and say "ready". We're going now.
---
It's not my job to make sure you know how to play your character, and I will not hold your hand in a 5 man dungeon. I expect the same treatment in return. If you invite me to tank your dungeon, I'm going to tank the shit out of it. Don't act like you're the most important person in the group and we will be fine.
---
Relatable as warrior tank, best is that they go full mana nuke so I can't keep rage up because they have to stop for Mana all the time.
---
Just put it in a very basic lua file and have your own add on loading.  
---
Take you five minutes to google how.
---
It will still be playable. It will be more difficult, but if you encounter a random 60, you cal also mett a 60 friend.
---
Let the locks die.
---
Boring, because you hear it a lot heh? Go back to your safe space, snowflake.
---
Grid2 does this too.
---
so real talk, how are locks in wpvp? i've been considering rolling one, but after killing every one i came across on my warrior i'm not so sure (well, except for once they hit 45+, then they started steamrolling me back, not being able to kill them before zerker rage runs out at that level means I get a full fear and then die).
---
remindme! 3 months
---
And don’t forget as a tank you have to farm at least 40g for consumables for raid night every week and get ready for those repair cost unless your guild pays for your repairs.
---
90% of the hunter pets on my server are just named Cat.
---
Yes it is
---
Forgot rank 0. Undead warlock, will fear you if your 10 levels under and watch you run into mobs for a durability loss death
---
And I dont want to play dark souls. But that's my game. Final fantasy is more of a game for you.
---
Well, question was if any movers have been regretting that and I can't answer that one! But I went and transferred anyway, so I hope I calculated this correctly. I have a feeling most layered servers will be quite unpleasant in a few weeks
---
You can't have any more than 6 action bars in vanilla. 5 on screen and 1 hidden that you have to change pages for. All those bars can be used with the default ui.
---
Lionheart is only a 25 dps increase over mask, if you're an orc it's much more worthwhile to get the axes IMO
---
A real shame, honestly.
---
FYI vigilante has an e
---
If you have friends or a guild low level ganking can sometimes turn into an incredible amount of fun.
---
Get the mount first imo.
---
Wait what? Half of being a healer was always mana management, what healers do nowadays then?
---
Depends how interested you are in min maxing
---
AWWWW YEAH, HEALING RAIDS AS FERAL FTW!
---
Right, so why are so many people up in arms about being able to see specs? If someone doesn't want you in a pug dungeon then damn that sucks for you but find a different group that won't do that or make your own.
---
Turning your guild raid from a 2 night a week thing to an hour or 2 a night thing is huge. Sure you can bounce some bad specs and still do that but what if everyone thought the same especially with pvp coming out?
---
I would never spec check someone especially a pug, but man doing a guild run in with everyone specced right took us about 40 minutes in Scholo. Pugs can be anywhere from the same about of time to over 2 hours in there depending on how bad people are. I don't blame people for wanting to shave all that time off to be able to do other things.
---
Is this a good PVE and PVP hybrid spec?
---
With world pvp coming, i want to be able to PVP effectively, but also continue to raid MC/Onyxia with my guild, and some AOE farming on the side. 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/203005--05353233122351021

Any suggestions for changes?

Imo nothing is worth more than epic mount.

My windfury might be broken, it only procs on rabbits.

Thats what we call spellcleave son. Hobby of the big dick robemen.

Hi, /u/VenGeeee
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dr4n1v/getting_stuck_at_logging_in_to_game_server_then/). 
---
It was once this way in classic - it was changed because the queue times on some servers wasn’t great but honestly I prefer fighting within the server, building rivalries and competition within a community.
---
I’d just try to push to 55 ASAP and then do some BRD - do the full quest run and then at 58 start strath/scholo/DM
---
By the time you’ve hit 60 you’ll have some gear and you can do all the quests you missed later for gold!
---
How the hell do you have 800g saved? When i was that lvl i had 80g at best. And go for the mount. The 100% its really usefull
---
I expected to get bored within a week, but I've been playing for over two months now and it's still fun... So I'm gonna say yeah, give it a try!
---
Where do you spent your time if you only have few hours to play every other day? Full time work and being a father to a younger than 1 year old doesn't explain that.
---
I was having a disagreement with a mage last night in Ulda. They "had" to tank an add to spare the healer, and my taunts were being resisted like CRAZY.
---
It was a real "am I a joke to you?" moment but TBH the taunt resists were entirely out of hand.
---
Really depends on the tank too , with a good tank I rarely have to drink at all
---
just for pvp in general
---
You are correct that it is easier to keep a tank alive despite the bloodfury than most dps getting bodied, the issue comes from the fact that while bloodfury does give a nice threat boost in the sense that it increases your attackpower quite substantially, it also makes it so that you essentially require twice as much healing during that period of time compared to what you need without it.
---
Depending on the gear of the warrior, its quite possible, even in dungeons, for the warrior to get overwhelmed with damage if they willingly put themselves in such a situation, and the headache of keeping them alive through their own reckless behavior falls on the healer.
---
That's my point.
---
Do you honestly think your healers arent using consumables? Thats your dps arent using their engineering items? That you're the only one with high enchanting or crafting costs? 
---
Wow, you showed up prepared for the dungeon like everyone else did... I should be impressed and offer you 25-50 gold worth of items.
---
Have no idea what kind of rotation or build you're pulling, but mages should not be doing 3x your DPS. As lock I am beating every mage in the guild for most fights, sitting at around 350-380 DPS.
---
I don’t know, maybe you’re just an unlikable person which I guess I could see. Having the ability to make friends as you level means you can fill group spots quickly. Healers tend to make friends with decent tanks as they progress to 60. I’ve never waited longer than 15 minutes for a tank. They’re not hard to find in LFG either at least on my realm.
---
As far as “tanks need gold”. Get a profession like everyone else. I really couldn’t care less about some random tanks raid prep, that’s on him and his guild. Not the randoms completing quests, getting pre-raid BIS, and fairly competing for drops.
---
You’re pretty entitled. I hope that mentality of yours is exclusive to your tanking, otherwise I feel sorry for you.
---
But they’re not or they wouldn’t have the shit spec.  
---
This isn’t new, the damn games been analyzed for 15 yrs, so it’s kind of known what works.
---
Tried this in vanilla and you do terrible dps. Even going fury with a shield is pretty bad.
---
Just for warning. I understand needing to try it to know yourself. But that will be the result.
---
What do you mean? There are bis lists day one. The difference is that its impossible to be really full bis in retail. But the bis lists exist. You are still chasing specific items, but maybe you get the wrong item titanforged making your bis no longer bid unlesd it also titanforges
---
Classes don't matter, races do. Everyone knows what I mean - gnome mages/warlocks, undead mages/warlocks, femtauren/femdead warriors. I don't even have to explain.
---
What others have said, plus those green belchers/abominations before Baron. anything nature/poison/lightning themed etc....
---
If you like Auctionator, there’s a [classic version](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24958-AuctionatorClassicquickfix.html). It’s what I use on everything but my AH alts and is perfectly good for 90% of what everyone does on the AH.
---
Mana tide is nice but not necessary. It's a free Mana pot every 5 min. What you will miss in 5 mans is healing way, an extremely helpful talent for tank healing. If you are ele specced, raid healing with chain heal is your best bet to be effective, and you should keep separate gear for healing since you will need plenty of +healing.
---
Except. Given the context. OP is being harassed for not wanting to comply with someone else.  Are you actually this slow?
---
That rejuv one that you did is the exact macro. It trys to cast it on whoever my current target is. It'll work on me. But not my partner. This happens to all beneficial spells I have macroed at times. Like, it was happening with my mark of the wild previously, but now its rejuvenation.
---
If I remember correctly druids are in the northeast.
---
Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one who absolutely does not want tbc and wrath back
---
You are safe in dungeons. And questing is imo lacklustre anyway.
---
Then tell me why I should play it?
---
100% these are the guys that get super salty if anyone even questions something they're doing.
---
doesn't even matter if you're right, these guys just don't want to be told their wrong
---
Yes, you don't understand how real life works. There are rules but rules are not black and white. There are all sorts of shades of grey in between. You're treating these rules as if they can only be black or white. This is the concept I was showing you with the drugs analogy, but you took it so literally that you thought I was actually comparing the cross faction collusion to taking drugs. Honestly you've got a lot of learning and developing to do before you should be writing long comments on the Internet, because you clearly just don't have a proper grip on how things work. You need to stop taking everything so literally. It's a shame to have to explain that to you but it's for the best, for your personal development.
---
Yeah I was about to say as SM Ruin I usually beat out the mages on Boss Fights. Mind you we have a shadowpriest, but I think some people are underestimating warlock DPS
---
Extremely simple you barely have to play
---
I don't think crusader stacks like that, you'd just have it up more frequently with it enchanted twice.
---
Its_big_brain_time.mp4
---
Epic mount makes getting money generally easier.  It'll make a big difference in PvP too.
---
Which class had to play with a handicap in the 1v1 tournament? Locks not shadowpriests.
---
The bottom line is that there's a Venn diagram with two circles, people who run sub-optimal talent specs and people who aren't very good at this game. A small amount of the overlap is due to the actual need for certain talents to be good at your class's job and some is just because bad players also make bad talent choices.  
---
One thing definitely does not necessarily indicate the other though.  I only really ask/check people's spec casually out of curiosity but in my experience it's most common for a bad player to be running a cookie cutter build but just have no idea how to manage their abilities for a given situation.  While you do see bad players who are making haphazard talent choices (and these bad players usually seem a lot easier to educate than others), I would say that the majority of people making weird choices are doing something specific based on actual knowledge of how their class works.
---
You of course gets specs that are just flat-out ineffective and don't work the way the person theorycrafted, it does depend on the class, but most of the time a person doing the right rotation will outperform a better geared or talented played who is a haphazard mess.  And bad talent spec really doesn't seem to have a huge correlation with pla garbage playing mechanics.
---
I agree. Finish your drink, healer, I'll pull the mobs back to your los
---
I imagine he’s referring to 31/5/15, the “MS offtank” spec
---
Keep it real
---
Let me save you a shitload of time and effort for the rest of your playtime on your Hunter:
---
    #showtooltip Call Pet
---
    /cast [nomod, nopet] Call Pet
---
    /cast [mod:shift, @pet, dead][mod:shift, nopet] Revive Pet; [mod:shift, 
---
    nochanneling] Mend Pet
---
    /petpassive [nomod]
---
    /petfollow [nomod]
---
Bind this to any key and use the modifiers to control your pet with 1 button.
---
My realm feels empty yet it's still layered
---
I think it stems from private servers where there is a global chat channel(sometimes for both factions together) which people talk shit or look for dungeon groups. In Classic people have made their own and so it's an unofficial world chat.
---
It's for you.
---
People seem to think its them solo vs the entire enemy faction.... you will have many allies in your zone with you along the way. Not screwed at all, you rolled a pvp server enjoy it.
---
Dammit, I should not have spent 15g on those wrists that get me to 10 weapon skill then...
---
Had another rogue sprinting away from me at low health. Sprint just made it easier to drop him into the lava with distract. 
---
My thing now is trying to remove as many ony buffs as I can from raid groups.
---
Not really an anti alliance thing, I just know how it goes lol
---
I've made posts about this as well, I think it's safe to say that there are many people who are finding issues with the same thing - except you'll probably get a lot of replies here stating it's all fine and well.
---
The server population should not have been increased by the amount it has. The world is too busy, there's too many people farming mats and mobs, and the AH is flooded. They have increased capacity but not the constraints. Whatever it is, it doesn't feel right.
---
Mine by default are all green tiles
---
I'm afraid I disagree. While there are certainly fewer tanks and healers, they are not impossible to find and simply put; that BoP cosmetic is an item almost everybody actually pretty much wants.
---
In what world are dungeons bad for mages? Lol
---
How about you give examples why it's for me?
---
I know it's not the same addon, but I leveled two characters with two different Guidelime routes, and the only dungeon they suggested doing was Zul'Farrak (I haven't come to the BRD/Temple levels yet, so not sure if that'll change). They actually explicitly said "not recommended" when you were in the level range for other dungeons, but every 3-4 levels they basically said "grats on levelup, you gotta grind 60% xp without quests to continue the route tho. sucks being you."
---
You don't have to do every dungeon, but big ones with a lot of quests I highly recommend, especially when you get to 30+ (Kraul, Downs, Uldaman, ZF). 
---
Just check the wowhead guides for dungeons, there's very good information about how many quests there are and where to get them. [Uldaman example](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/uldaman-classic-dungeon-strategy#alliance-uldaman-dungeon-quests)
---
Generally it's about questing only kill quests, dont travel between zones unless outleveling them, skills/cities only when big upgrade of skills comes, be super efficient at killing mobs and downtime (abuse bandages, pick efficient specc), mostly avoid dungeons. It makes a huge difference. But is also quite boring.
---
Flying mounts were cool for like a week.
---
That uses more bind space, though. All 5 of my bars are filled up right now, space saving macros like this are pretty useful.
---
Yea no I’m sorry but all that happened is the number of people who want to try at the game has increased because the barrier to entry for that has drastically lowered. If you think classic was marketed this way then idk what to tell you. It has nothing to do with streamers or esports. Just because someone disagrees with you doesn’t mean they are misunderstanding you or “fell off the ride”. You’ll understand this when/if you grow up one day.
---
Only the very last few servers turned out to be anything other than that. I joined a server in like the third or fourth wave of new servers and it became high pop all the same. You can't control who joins after you do.
---
Any other mage tricks like this? What about sheep?
---
Once BGs launch? A blind monkey could do it.
---
In phase 2? You probably will have to make *some* effort.
---
Skullflame EU - unplayable as ally due to faction disbalance. Every single questing spot is camped by massive amounts of hordes.
---
Because that's what levi and kirito play
---
Yep. Got an alt shaman I'm levelling, mostly by healing dungeons now I'm higher level. Had a 45 warrior tanking a full run of zf and I would need to drink after every pull, meanwhile warlock is tapping down to 200 hp every fight, and whining because I won't heal him... I can barely keep the tank alive.
---
Time is money!! Get that mount!!!
---
What do you expect? It's not classic if people have to learn new things. It's a old game.. nothing new here
---
Obvious testing. You can't cancel a spell 4/10ths of a second and have it go off. You can however do it at 2/10 of a second.
---
3x the damage? The prob isn’t the class, the problem is between your chair and your screen.
---
good luck being a min/maxer and not raiding lmao
---
Yeah nice troll dude.. just dont comment if you dont know what I am talking about
---
tullaRange is the addon for you then. allows you to pick colors for out of range and out of mana, and ofc colors the whole icon.
---
Also dailies, increased level cap, lfg and arenas
---
Why don't you make a new Reddit account at this point OP?
---
Sounds like SUPER FUN, the Blizzard way!
---
Who is about to drop ony head?
---
Learn it, the durations increase
---
Whats wrong with arenas?
---
You could have leveled at least 2 or 3 classes in BFA to 110 in the time it took you to reach 60 in Classic.
---
The rumor was a free copy of BFA upon hitting 60, but it was just a mistake posted on a Brazilian Facebook page and taken down in the same day.
---
If your guildies are telling you to give up and re-roll on a PvE server, you need a new guild
---
I'm sad. On server where population is A 35% - 65% H and it's very frustrating to get anywhere because there is always 20+ horde attacking you I thought that when BGs will launch I'll have much shorter queue times compred to Horde. Of course they still can stay next to instance entrances and farm kills. :)  
---
So, actually there is no reason for newcomers (yeah, I got 3 friends who want to start Classic) to play on less populated fraction.
---
A fellow Nethergarde Keep ally!
---
You’re not.
---
Let me explain this as simple as can be.
---
You see two people talking. One guy says "No I don't want to associate myself with that." And peacefully walks away.
---
He is followed by the other man who insults him, yells at him, and calls him names.
---
Who do you agree with? Because it's really goddamn simple. It isn't the antagonistic person trying to force someone to do something against their will.
---
Even better? We have the context of that argument!
---
K. Show me good parses without arcane power
---
“Good players”. Cuz they’re bad at the game and need 3 healers to heal them at all times
---
Because for you reddit neckbeards, if you aren't sweating your way to 60 you just don't deserve to play the game. Must be nice having your mom there to make you tendies every night.
---
Someone is actually trying to have fun with the game? No we can't have that. Sweats only boys. This is serious business.
---
I ran a census 2 weeks ago before making a character, it was basically 50:50 with a bit more level 60 alliance characters
---
I mean, it would be more challenging because people would have a lot less information available to them at that stage of the game. But in no way would it make the game so much harder that it'd be impossible to raid. You'd still see the same outcome. What you're seeing is a game that really, in its core, isn't that hard.
---
It won’t be realms. It’ll be everyone goes tbc or no one goes. They won’t split up the community like that.
---
It's okay I know it's hard to comprehend someone has a different opinion than you.
---
Faerlina? Lmao
---
Yep. Definitely a mixed bag. It was crazy in here at the height of the layering debate though.
---
Nah it's an emergency cast. The Mana efficiency is less than almost anything else. One shield costs double the Mana of heal rank 4 and does 2/3 of the healing or less if you account for crits.
---
I heal pretty much all dungeons with rank 4 heal and flash heal rank 5. Exclusively. I can solo heal UBRS full -- pre bis geared but no mc/only loot yet... Thanks rng.
---
AFAIK there's an additional 10% discount in major cities if you are rank 3 or higher.
---
Epic mount + training = 1,000g
---
With honored = 900g
---
With rank 3 + honored = 800g
---
Correct me if I'm mistaken
---
I have the same problem and I had the same issue last year during blizzcon.
---
Do mining/skinning/herb for cash until you are past lvl 35 and have acquired blood of the mountain, then you can powerlevel enchanting and drop it again after crafting the trinket
---
That's what I am doing
---
Ye, and I have reached the end of the queue twice, but nothing happen and battlenet won't start
---
I've been doing that for a while now lol
---
We unfortunate few alliance who do are mercilessly murdered by minimum 2-1 odds usually. And all our 60s never help or care whilst the horde 60s are blood thirsty and Jump at the chance to camp 40-50s for dare trying to level up in the presence of similar level horde lol
---
You don't really need to learn mana management until you start raiding anyways, the difficulty gap was quite significant IMO, for classic at least. Going from ubrs 15 to MC was a huge jump, at least for me.
---
I for one would like them to remove world buffs being allowed in raids, this would at least add more progression value out of its existing form
---
me too..  whats going on?
---
I'm not bitching. I'm offering a different perspective on the situation.
---
I don't want it to target anyone. I want it to cast on my current target(which it should be doing). The macro has worked before, and then quit, possibly as the max rank of the spell has gone up. This has been happening with all of my beneficial spells from time to time.
---
It’s because it’s new. You’re always going to feel like that when something is new. When you get further in end game in retail and realize there’s thousands of epics that drop, which have 30 different stats, no one cares about your gear because they all have transmog and look cool, and then you see things selling for 300k gold in the auction house and that being a normal price, you’ll have second thoughts
---
&gt; REEEEEE!!! Feral druids can't heal! Arms warriors can't tank! Ret paladins should neck themselves!
---
Nobody gives a damn how you are specced. They're just happy to get a healer/tank. This is an entirely made up problem, presumably by people who don't get invited simply because they are bad players.
---
Heh, same. To make it worse my 2 year old has an agression problem. Anytime he sees me playing hell try to hit everyone for the next 2 days like he saw in the game. So I can only play when hes sleeping.
---
At your level, you should expect its a possibility that you will be a killed a lot for honor since level 49+ counts as an HK for level 60's.  
---
We dont know how many people living in dungeons will suddenly be out in the world doing pvp, so it remains to be seen how 'unplayable' some zones may become.
---
Yeah it's as if that's how it used to be or something
---
Same. Impossible to find any groups at the high end because people only run what has BIS not because it's fun. By the time I find one I dont have time to do the dungeon. I'm in the minority but I like dungeon finder....idk probably going to quit. Just not enough time to instance or raid. I would come back for TBC and or wotlk. And yes I played vanilla...but I was a kid with time.
---
We won’t actually. This ain’t pservers and im pretty sure that’s easily provable collusion.
---
Explain?
---
I'm a shaman.  I'm our guild's second best PvE healing shaman on my worst day.  I have exactly 20 points in restoration because the current content is absurdly easy and deep restoration is hot garbage while deep elemental gives me an insane boost to my ability to grind, DPS instances, and PvP.  If people could see my talents I'd be having to defend myself every week why Purification is worthless when it only affects base healing and I have over 500 bonus healing, why Healing Way is worthless because I don't tank heal, and why Mana Tide is worthless because I'm the only mana user in my group 99% of the time *and* I rarely even have to use a mana pot let alone need more.  It would cost me 100g per week while requiring I spend over 48 hours as a terrible world spec to get people to stop bothering me about it.
---
If someone's spec is genuinely holding them back you won't need to see their talents to know.  It'll show up on the meters and it'll show up in them not being able to provide key abilities.  If it's not, then it's not, and their spec is their own business.
---
Hunters freak me out sometimes, because they wait until the last moment to use feing death, so for a moment they became the hunter of Schrodinger's.
---
Expectations of having only 2 dps in your group instead of 3 lol.
---
Unbinding worked! Thank you. Was driving me nuts, because i have a few other macros with shift mods set up the same way and they work just fine.
---
A quick way to make it better is to not use the word "toon".
---
My guild already killed the city bosses. We will not go anywhere near them in p2. Also, we won’t kill trade either. We prefer the good ole fashioned way of murdering as much horde as possible.
---
thanks for the tips. It works now after changing the keybind for Shift+1
---
Agreed, It’s annoying when your trying to get the party leader to add someone to the group and they have that shit in their name. 
---
I usually just move on to the next person.
---
Oooh, also I changed the macro to just be /cast rejuvenation and the same issue is happening. Umma Google known bugs.
---
You can’t change it. No changes at all. Go back to retail.
---
That is a nice looking axe
---
It's a horrible strat... Wut? 
---
Even in pre-bis gear, 5 shields is over 30% Mana.
---
depends on the server. but it could indeed make leveling a lot slower. its not only the 48-59 whos screwed. also life will be a lot harder for solo l 60 players
---
Indeed
---
Want to hear how shitty I was in retail? I leveled mostly holy specced but tried to heal dungeons wearing some goofy mashup of int/str gear. I was solely responsible for 90% of my BRD wipes until I gave up at 56, 3 months before BC. Then I resubbed and learned summit keeping 2 sets of gear.
---
I don't need a raid spec to be a top raid performer.
---
its over, might aswell just quit the game already
---
Low level healing can be rough. It gets a lot better.
---
But bad tanks definitely kill it.
---
Right. I said that off what originally was said. I know he announced that now. 
---
Seems more like a patch now.
---
You can adjust the amount displayed in chat by changing the range of the random number that's generated: 
---
    random(100,20000)
---
to whatever range of values you want. GetCoinText(n) will output a money value "x Gold, y Silver, z Copper", "x Silver, y Copper", or "x Copper" based on the number passed to it. The number passed to GetCoinText(n) is an amount of copper. So 510 copper would be "5 Silver, 10 Copper".
---
Feel free to adjust the macro as you'd like!
---
When I did them for most of 30-60, the measured xp/hour was really not very good, because of the constant issues caused by other players. In a hypothetical world with 4 other skilled players who are always avaliable its great sure.
---
It does.
---
If you are expecting cleave/aoe damage, why is it a bad strat? Especially when you can sit down and drink after shielding up.
---
GROUP.  Sorry introverts, this is an mMorpg.  You need to talk to people and stick together to stay safe.
---
This definitely looks straight out of a cartoon.
---
One I would watch.
---
This just goes to show how many terrible warlocks are out there, honestly
---
In the time that would have taken you could have done this like three times lmao.
---
I cannot deal with the people who jsit have this huge box of spells..personally it sucks to look at lol
---
Sounds like you got tanks that dont know how to utilize mocking blow ww and thunderclap properly
---
It depends if you are on the dominant faction on your server.  The horde almost permanently control BRD entrance on my server, I doubt this will change in P2.
---
I actually saw it as a positive there was only 1 server. Ensures there will be a healthy population down the line. Was a bit upset they added felstriker.
---
while I mostly agree with you, there's no such thing as world or server first in classic really. any semi organized team will be able to down any boss in very few attempts because the game is just not that hard. like I pugged rag with a bunch of people who had never seen him before and we one shot it. there was only one mechanic lmao.
---
Make new challenges for yourself or for your guild. The beauty of this game is still there.
---
It's more like 2.5 at worst. DPS aside we also provide 70 STR, 60 AGI if you're totem weaving, 12.5 mp5, 60 fire/frost resist, decent aoe, off-heal, ranged interrupt, slows and probably one of the more important parts - poison/disease cure which is beneficial in a good chunk of 60 dungeons.
---
Shaman dps whether ele or enh provides a metric fuck ton of utility in worst case.
---
Cross-faction collusion isn’t a TOS/EULA/CoC violation and hasn’t been for almost a decade. There’s even a vendor potion in Retail that allows you to chat cross-faction and Classic has absolutely no addendums to any of the agreements or rulesets. We’ve already seen plenty of CFC in Devilsaur farming with no repercussions.
---
Honor coalitions/cartels were a thing in Vanilla and they’ll be coming back even more in Classic. Join one or forever be regulated to single digit ranks.
---
oh damn i thought that was against the rules..
---
AOT = Attack on Titan
---
SAO = Sword Art Online
---
Levi and Kirito are characters in those anime
---
Wrath raiding was excellent. Ulduar was one of the best ever raids.
---
Get you bis gear first
---
Epic mount should be the last thing you buy at 60
---
He is asking if he can enter raids while being dungeon locked (max 5 resets per hour and then you can't enter until that hour mark)
---
I mean they should expect hots.
---
If the priest is busy saving the tank or a close range dps ya don't worry we can probably manage if you we gotta hit it a couple times to keep dpsing.
---
But if you're just sitting there with a bunch of mana and I'm oom, I'm definitely gonna life tap and priest should definitely toss me a heal.
---
That shit is common courtesy, like handing out cookies or giving a priest a soul stone.
---
Don't turn warlocks don't need heals because "LiFE tAp" more memey than it already is.
---
Hot take
---
Life drain is a garbage skill and isn't worth the mana when there's a perfectly capable priest on the team.
---
Jesus is Marbelle ever not in that spot.... :D
---
What's a hydro flask?
---
thats great! i dont remember nay of that from tbc
---
I was afk at the sw fp the other day. Came back to someone in duskwood asking for help so I figured why not it’s a short flight. I was getting ready to 1v1 another 60 and It was just a level 48 causing terror. I camped/chased back to STV while multiple people were thanking me. Felt good.
---
Cuz the tank is the only one that can know how much he can tank with a given healer.  I would never let you run my 5 man groups...
---
This needs more appreciation
---
Being able to look at newbies and see the frustration, excitement and joy is unparralel. It is definitely contagious.
---
Yes I love classic too, but I will instantly take a break from classic when shadowland launch. That’s for sure:)
---
That's kind of obvious isn't it. I don't get what's that got to do with anything, it's a given that the better your tank and party and your gear is the less you have to cast healing spells and the lower you get to downrank. That has nothing to do with spending money on drinks. And, why are you complaining about drinking expenses if you can drink less.
---
You keep switching between arguments for the oddest reasons.
---
Need all BoE blue and purps. That is the rule in groups I put together.
---
It may have been in Vanilla, but cross-faction collusion was removed from the Code of Conduct almost 10 years ago and Classic uses the same agreements and rules that Retail does, where there’s literally a vendor consumable that lets you chat in-game with the enemy.
---
DM:N/Tribute is really easy if your group knows what they’re doing. You can skip plenty of mobs and bosses and the last boss is easy. Plenty of experienced players still clear tribute runs as well for the buffs, so it shouldn’t be to hard to find a decent group.
---
Life drain procs shadowbolts if you are specced
---
Too late for world first yes.
---
lmao refurbished for dark mode one year later. I think I'll give him a pass
---
You forgot the gluten-free and the alcohol-free beer drinker
---
Sucker
---
If everyone had to go to TBC and they just remove Classic WoW, then there would again be people asking for Classic WoW. Having TBC and Classic open at the same time would let the people who like TBC/WotLK &gt; Classic to play what they want to play. 
---
Would I like to see Classic have content updates? Yes, but that comes at the risk of having bad updates effectively ruining Classic.
---
I would rather see WotLK release atleast before Classic updates
---
&gt; try to lure back some into retail
---
But both games are the same subscription. Why would they desperately want you to play one game instead of the other?
---
Isn’t the hole in the wall that leads to the cave closed until you get him down to a certain percent the first try?
---
Please continue with the “RUUUUN, FUCKING RUUUUUUUN!” Soundbites. They’re my favorite
---
It's fucking dying now
---
Its not.  Only the tank can know how much he can tank with any given healer.
---
Cats are great too, sneak around like a rogue, if your tank pulls too much, BOOM now you have two tanks. Also they like scratches behind their ears.
---
It's almost like....the game is 15 years old, or something.
---
Imagine that.

We could totally be stopping for mana every pull, help me help you.
---
I'd like them to add attunements to WotLK among other things
---
Just got to 55 and plan on dungeon leveling the rest of the way. Is spamming dire maul the best path now that it is out?
---
Well yes if you do **tribute** it's **obviously different**. I've done 1 full run-through (with a fury tank who I suspect DW'd from time to time) only and no tributes, but boy some of the stuff in there hits hard.
---
Just putting my subjective difficulty rating out there for OP, but n=1 is admittedly a bad basis for a fair comparison.
---
Sadly its wasted on a pally lol
---
So I tried a few things... Currently, I have rank 6 rejuv. When I use the macro on myself it works, when I use it on another guy who's around my level it works. When I use it on my partner who's about 12 levels below me it doesn't. But, when I use just the rank 6 spell rejuv(no macro) on my partner, it works fine.
---
Or worse: not having a beard.
---
Why does other people doing something "take the fun out of it" for you? Why do you care how they play?
---
Because drain tanking is the meta for leveling atm, its really smooth from lvl 38 on, even smoother from 40 with dark pact.
---
Ya lol at OP thinking people don’t know about wowhead. Like, wat
---
This video is obnoxious as hell
---
Depends on your role (if you're tanking, 55 is insufficient for most dungeons still), but probably not better just to spam those than a combination of those and other end-game dungeons.
---
Maybe its because it not such an open are and we cant see everyone, but OG looked like it had 3x as many people when i got the buff. Adn not only on one layer, on both. I would post a screenshot but i took it with my phone to send to my freidn to whatsapp and people would lose their minds because it isnt an actual screenshot
---
Executioners cleaver, use that till 55 and then get dreadforge retaliator.
---
The issue is more for raids where there's limited debuff slots. Most times you simply aren't allowed your dots.
---
There are "BIS lists" in retail, but instead of specific items, it's "whatever has (your preferred secondary stat) and the highest ilvl" for every slot.
---
I did 55-60 by farming dungeons for my prebis gear.  You will be doing a lot of those dungeons to get your equipment so why not get some experience while you're at it, too?
---
Good luck on one day growing up. I wish you well
---
Doesn’t it make sense that a 15 year old game would be fully figured out? People play classic for many different reasons, maybe it’s just not the game for you! 
---
Are you asking for mythic versions of raids? Cause that might be cool but it does kind of go against the whole idea of classic.
---
Someone doing something you don't like =/= toxic, you big baby.
---
why do you even know ions last name and especially how to write it
---
Resto shamans provide the same buffs and purges while also actually accomplishing their role of healer. Enhance provides buffs and say that it "makes up" for their failure to accomplish their role. Restos also actually have mana to totem weave.
---
I don't see enhance shamans totem twisting much, seems like they don't have the mana for it, or are too busy using their mana trying to show up on the meters. Id take a real DPS over a totem bot any day of the week. Id also take a enhance shaman in healing gear using healing spells over an enhance shaman that pretends hes a DPS any day of the week.
---
Like what's the point of a enhance shaman getting all this melee gear? He doesn't do damage anyway and if he wants to emphasize his utility shouldn't he get like some mana gear instead?
---
Seems like they are just trying to chase a dream. We have enhancement shamans in our raids to buff melee, but they heal and wear healing gear and play like healers. They don't try to dps to stroke their precious ego.
---
I've definitely been in plenty of groups where a tank was brought in who didn't know the fights or the layout and didn't want lead.
---
If it’s that over pop then give them the fearlina treatment.. free transfer outs
---
Alright, probably right. As mrcoffee suggests, it seems very much login-server related. Chop chop, get that replacement server from the cellar, boys!
---
Stay affliction. The shadow priest will smoke casters when it gets silence. As to UD melee, just put up dots and try to survive their initial burst. Have hearthstone and post ready. If succubus is out I think you can charm them and re start the fight.
---
Both human and gnome racials must be used strategically, dont use it unless your going to get away and be able to kite
---
Raiding at 60 means you don't have the debuff slots needed to fully dot your target in what are primarily single target dps fights. It also means going against a target 3 levels higher than you when you have little to no +hit for your shadowbolts, whereas frost mages have talents getting them the +hit they need.
---
You know, I was going to reply with the intent to refute your points, but you're completely correct on all fronts. 
---
Sorry that I was stroking my ego because I wanted to play Enhancement Shaman. Have a good one :)
---
I'll get you next time, He-man!

The meaning changed for kids. Most adults know "boomer" as a "baby boomer". While I realize we are on a kids culture sub, this micro bubble of society is not the sole dictator of the evolution of language.
---
What mount is this?
---
Either this doesn't effect you as you're on a PvE server or you're on a PvP server which should mean you would have been looking forward to meaningful PvP, I have no idea why you're spitting your dummy out over it.
---
I've been waiting this entire time for some form of meaningful PvP to come out, that's the whole reason I came back to classic and p3 cannot come soon enough.
---
i can agree with that aspect of it, but i'd rather get into the battle quicker/have equal number of players instead of having BG's that are half full or something
---
Shift clicking the rank 6 into the macro didn't allow it to work on partner. When I make it 5 it'll work on him. So I guess it is the rankings causing the issue...and that when I drag the rank 6 spell to my bar and use it on my partner it auto-downgrades like you said.
---
Currently I would rather bring someone who is at the top of both meters than someone who is middle of the road in effective healing but bottom of the overhealing. 
---
Overhealing literally only matters if you're going oom too early. Otherwise it's completely meaningless. 
---
Parsing as a healer I don't care about too much but I do think it's the right attitude to be trying to compete. Usually results in a positive situation for the raid if everyone is fighting to keep folks alive.
---
If u have clear cast use rank 1 arcane expl to fish for clearcast
---
Kill them before they kill you.
---
Uh are you going full affliction and not SM/Ruin??? Because SM/Ruin should definitely be pretty high in the DPS chart

So sylvanas could have just spared that beautiful helmet, goddamnit

Even for the Priest bis pattern when there's one priest in the group who is 60 and a tailor and doesn't have it yet?
---
People are talking a lot of world pvp coming in phase 2. What does this mean on PvE servers? What changes? Will PvP become a thing for these servers or is this just not an issue unless on a PvP server.
---
If they are doing 3 times your damage the problem isn't your spec it's you. Also affliction isn't a spec for locks, SM/Ruin is and is competitive with mages, you won't out dps a good one but you sure as fuck won't be doing 1/3 their damage...
---
Was this on Mograine weeks ago? I remember seeing him sit there.
---
It seems you apply different meaning to the term farming, care to share?
---
No heals? Nice.
---
I have a 57 Undead Priest and my wife just birthed our first child this morning. I know the best thing I can do right now is spam BRD and other dungeons for my BiS gear on my way to 60, but I'm looking for a good alternative that I can due with a napping baby that doesn't require quite so much attention/commitment as dungeon running.
---
Are there any particularly good quest rewards that are near BiS or mobs I can farm for items that will be useful for high level dungeons/raiding down the line while I grind out these last few levels with the little guy?
---
I currently have 300/300 Herb/Mining, but I plan to swap Mining for Alchemy and probably Herbalism for Tailoring in the near future if that makes any difference.
---
Granted I’m only level 41 but I 2h tank everything and my brother who is a priest says it’s too easy. He prefers me to wear the 2h. So there’s that.
---
Depends on your battlegroup I guess but back in the day my battlegroup started developing cross server rivalries as a result of it, which wasn't too bad.
---
I have a warrior with no BiS gear and I've killed plenty of hunters way above my level. It's pretty obvious hunters aren't exactly designed well to deal with melee classes in PvP.
---
At low levels, there's not a lot of options besides just going out and hitting weaker opponents.
---
But when you get to the higher levels, fight some of the "Servants of &lt;Demon&gt;" enemies in the Blasted Lands, when they reach 1% hp they become immune to all damage and you can just attack them for a while to gain skills.
---
Alternatively, do a DM:N run, and at the end attack the ogre-ghosts. They don't fight back and you can just leave your character AFK for a while as they level up their weapon skills.
---
Yeah, but in the end, 15g isn't much.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/50013213302--0502520103511051
---
This is the build I use for pvp, I also use it for raiding but it's not the ideal raid spec for shadow, although it works fine for all other pve.
---
For a pve/pvp hybrid spec you would just drop some survivability talents and put them into mana talents. For example drop imp mana burn and maybe imp inner fire for spirit tap.
---
Dont bother with anything in the holy tree, it's all useless for shadow.
---
Also dont listen to people saying "lol meme spec" or "play holy", they just haters who think classic wow can only be played as a min/max hyper serious game when in reality, people are clearing the content with half the people required.

Shitty
---
Whether the lock is like the mage depends a bit on the context. They're much more similar in how they play in PvE than in PvP I think. Whether they're too similar of course is subjective.
---
To be honest I'd just play the lock if you think its the most fun. There's no use in having a character who can heal and tank if you prefer to just play lock; unless your group of friends really needs a healer or something.
---
Any around your level.
---
OP asked for slaying though
---
Same thing for me at skullflame..
---
Recipe for flask of the titans drops. I'm alchemist, say I need recipe since I don't have it yet. A few others roll need even though they are not alch. Is this standard practice? Need before greed goes out the window just because it's an expensive recipe?
---
&gt;Ironically, classic is turning out to be far less challenging than retail.
---
Did you honestly ever think it wouldn't be?
---
I don't train my spells because they cost gold so it's pay to win
---
Only thing that's other people's business is whether or not you can perform. If you have the right talents but still suck, it's not gonna help any.
---
I (priest) prefer druid tanks. Those mana drinks are too expensive to waste healing 2h warrior tanks.
---
BRD is just a pain in the ass, not so much difficult.  Kindof a test of competence more than anything.  Bring your group in there to find out if they're worth their salt.  
---
DM:W tests if people can focus the right target or not with harsh punishment.  
---
Scholo is like an endurance race.  
---
Start UD can mainly be a pre-raid gear-check.
---
BWL is going to be just as much of a faceroll.
---
Everything to naxx will be below lfr level facerolling. Naxx is probably on par with normal raids in retail, but will still be faceroll for any organized guilds.
---
&gt; Except life tap, life drain and syphon are resource neutral
---
That's not true, those give more than they take ( death coil is debatable, but it's still an extremely efficient spell), and Life Tap has a compounding effect on all of it.
---
As a tank, please say you’re on Grobb. Save me. Please.
---
This isn't remotely true as a general rule. On Ashkandi, which is certainly not a streamer server, everyone rolls need on BoE Epics but its not as common Blues or expensive mats.
---
It's a practice that's existed since Vanilla, doesn't mean it's used by everyone or everywhere but it isn't uncommon.
---
gandling was a low populated server to begin with
---
By the phrasing of your questions I assume you want something that is good enough at both. You havent really specified whether or not you want it to be for solo/dungeon pve, or raid pve so ill assume you don't mean raid and explain below.
---
\- Solo, PvP/PvE build:  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/5040021305--0512324100511051](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/5040021305--0512324100511051)\- Solo/Dungeon PvP/PvE build: [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/5050011305--0532322100511051](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/5050011305--0532322100511051)
---
Shadow Priests already do very weak damage relative to the other classes. You should be in a dedicated raid spec if you want to raid and do your job effectively.- Dedicated raid PvE Spec:  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/5050101305--0522504100501051](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/5050101305--0522504100501051)I am the number 1 Shadow Priest on my server according to Warcraft Logs, and this is the Raid Spec I use. Your Mind Blast cooldown lines up perfectly with 2 Mind Flays. This will maximize your DPS, while also giving you some threat reduction in talents.
---
Alternatively, if you want to focus on PvP, you should try this build. You'll notice every build on this list includes 5/5 Mental Agility, and that is because Shadow is already VERY mana hungry, even if you have a perfect spell rotation, and use consumes properly. Anyway, this is the spec I used to win the 1v1 tourney my guild held:  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/5001321305--0502322103511051](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/5001321305--0502322103511051)
---
You'll also notice none of these specs include Spirit Tap, or Wand Specialization. Wand Specialization is good while leveling, because you dont have the mana pool to continue casting at a consistent rate. However Shadow Priests already deal low damage relative to others, so you'll need a larger mana pool and need to cast more often to compete in damage meters. You should ONLY be wanding when you have no mana, or are conserving mana. Spirit Tap is good if you have a PvE Focus for solo content, however you should just bite the bullet and just buy more water if you want blackout for PvP. Blackout is strong in solo PvE and PvP, whereas Spirit Tap is only good for reducing downtime in solo PvE.
---
Make all the other gnomish stuff (the stuff that only gonmish engs can make) as well before you re-roll. 
---
That said, there's no reason to re-roll unless you want to be able to craft goblin sappers yourself. Or unless you prefer an Everlook teleport to Gadgetzan.
---
I would imagine if they knew about it for long they wouldn't be so woefully incompetent in using it.
---
My improved aspect of the hawk usually procs on both.
---
There’s the boots from Wiley, which are acceptable pre bis. But that’s it.
---
Exactly. The whole point is to have the old content available to those that want to play it. What would be the point in converting all Classic realms into TBC? Ppl would just go back to private servers... Not a good business call imo.
---
sap them when they jump, wave at them and shoot them out of the air.
---
When did you bubble them? As they went in?
---
If so... stop doing that. Only time a warrior tank should be bubbled is if they got so low they'd die in the time it takes to cast a flash heal. Save bubbles for DPS.
---
This, let people play how they want to play. It's not like the raids are so hard that it's impossible with non-meta specs.
---
4/5 of the mages in my guild are AP with the last ones specced WC. It is a noticeable damage increase in raids. 
---
There are plenty of AP Frost mages atm, but at this stage in the game you can beat all the endgame content in greens and whatever spec you want as long as your tank and healers are decent so most people just don't bother.
---
You're not wrong. Reroll alliance on a server that's close to 50/50.
---
I agree with you, but hopefully the point I was making can still be seen.
---
He inspired me to be a sick cunt, not a sad cunt
---
Good for you. Doesn't mean anything to me at all but good for you.
---
Gz on talking bs
---
Oh. When he said affliction I assumed it was during dungeons while leveling. My b. I didn't think we were talking about a ruin hybrid affliction spec.
---
Guess again. :D
---
The boost was never announced officially, but rather a leak. Meaning that you will likely recieve a boost, but only once the promotion is active. 
---
tl;dr: You will get it Soon™
---
So you're telling me for just 5 gold i can get the recipe without having to run all the way to Stonetalon or Hillsbrad and risking it not being up on the vendor? Sign me up
---
name changes arent a thing in classic so you are lying.
---
enjoy standing in org for hours because u dont wanna splitt the repair bills with the tanks and let them have the 1-4gold item.
---
PS im mage myself and i think its pathetic that you wouldnt give the items to tanks, they cannot farm and u need them.  
---
their repair costs are sometimes 10gold or higher. If u pay his repairs i bet he wont mind not taking any items
---
Last raid i was in i started doing dps because everyone was just at full hp all the time. Afterwards i lookeda t the logs and all the top healers had literally more overheal than actual healing. And they all just mindlessly spammed heals on the tank and their 2nd highest healed targets were the warlocks... As long as people dont screw up the mechanics there are very few encounters that actually require significant group heal...
---
If everyone runs around and gets a thorium node every 20 minutes on average, I wouldn't call this "farming".
---
in 480P?
---
Serious min-maxers don't have time for silly things like a good name.
---
That site is only accurate for the first couple of days of launch. I wouldn’t pay too much attention. A lot of people stopped playing, transferred off, rerolled. Who knows what the actual balance is. Stalagg is the most dominated horde server apparently but I get ganked by alliance all the time
---
In vanilla wasn't alliance the more popular faction? Just as on pservers. No way you could know.
---
I do it for lock pets ,my bar is sooo full already!!
---
Should? Maybe.  But forcing people to respec constantly for faceroll content isn't even remotely necessary.
---
Some people play for aesthetics and dwarf is not really good looking to me imo especially the female
---
Hey now you know it’s a vendor sold item I guess I did my job you’re welcome.
---
There is also a spell?
---
Where does it drop? On the ah is like 40g
---
The people we save from Horde in STV would beg to differ.  But go ahead and do you.  You might have Honor, but a lot of these Horde don’t so we like to remind them we aren’t just pushovers and will fight back and do what they do to us.
---
Any spec warrior should be able to tank dungeons without issue. Unless they're stupid and didnt ever bother also picking up a tanking set of gear along the way. Even with a full dps set of gear you can get along tanking if you just put a shield on
---
kek
---
Savage
---
They're probably using AoE spec and then switch to AP when they run MC (that's what I do at least).  Respeccing just for Ony is definitely not worth.
---
pot meet kettle??
---
I haven't encountered this behavior yet either, but based on the comments it must not be uncommon. 
---
I wouldn't really be down for those kind of groups. The only case I'd be cool on someone rolling on it is if they planned on swapping professions or no one was an alchemist (extremely unlikely).
---
I agree, by the logic of needing money you could just roll need on everything, especially if you're broke.
---
I was in an UBRS run when elemental mage staff dropped. Everyone checked with the two mages to make sure they didn't need, then everyone rolled greed. Someone rolling need cause they were broke would not have ran with us again.
---
I didnt know that, thanks!
---
Wtf did you expect honestly?
---
boomer
---
I consider a poly one of my first steps to set up my shatter combo that wipes my mortal enemies off this world.
---
Therefore I can't poly without feeling like I've already ended their lives.
---
Both Spell Batching and Leeway were absolutely in vanilla. 
---
Go back to private servers or retail. Classic is an authentic Vanilla experience.
---
I want to be in 2009 forever and blizzard is offering me this escape. GIB PLZ
---
Is rogue wanted/viable for pve stuff? I would play on pvp realm but don't have time to bamboozle with ganks
---
As someone leveling a Prot Paladin tank as one of my many alts—what the FUCK is a Taunt?
---
Hell yeah brudder, get it =)
---
My guild has 2 assigned winters chill mages and 4 arcane. Every Member ranked mage who joins usually is winters chill as well. But it could work with no arcane mage at all
---
Ohh, gotta run around irl, but I feel I could make that work
---
You’re so clever, thankfully karma on a website isn’t something I value but you trying to garner it from your attempt at wit is laughable - thank you for being so sad I can feel better just knowing I’m not you.
---
They gonna rush it again 100% and fuck them for that...Its like Activision wants to ruin WoW again
---
Bad rogues can make tanking hell.
---
And the odd time a friend and I 2 v 1 any horde they /golfclap or hop on their main and camp.
---
rogues are top dps  in every phase
---
id raid daggers spec on a pve realm btw
---
Exact same with alliance on Kirtonos. Not one high level ever came to my aid in any zone. Not ONE. But if I COUNTERGANK one enemy and I see the delay in their release, I know in about 3 minutes a full group will be on me.
---
Arcane is better, no question about it.
---
However, as long as you take all of the single target specific Frost talents in addition to the AOE abilities, it makes farming gold much easier.
---
Once there are more raids to farm each week, you will start seeing people switch since the extra damage is helpful when speed clearing all the raids each week. 
---
Additional, we may even see new or modified builds across all classes with the introduction of the dual wielding Warrior tank spec.
---
I might have one other thing that could work but I wanna test the concept first before posting here.  
---
Edit: The other thing I thought might work, won't. I'm curious to find a good fix for this though.
---
&gt;I work 70+ hours per week, have a rich social life and i am close to dinging 60 on my SECOND char.
---
next time when you make some bullshit up try doing the math before claiming to work 70+ hours a week, and having a life AND leveling 2 60's.
---
everything about #1 gave me a panic attack
---
To be fair, the amount of collusion that would happen today makes it problematic.
---
&gt; Can you explain to me how a rogue tanking 4hm could possibly work with the mechanics of the fight? When I played we had times where rogues would tank Instructor Razuvious or Vaelatrasz in emergencies, but 4hm is a fight that requires very specific tank swaps with precise timing and positioning.
---
Sure. Exactly, how prot paladins do it, there's a few video of prot paladin tanking 4HM. Essentially, BoP.
---
A rogue tank's limit is up t'ill AQ and a few bosses in Naxx.
---
saying they will know every strat flawlessly is an overstatement. the best guilds will breeze through sure, but BWL is going to destroy players for weeks and weeks when it comes out.
---
You don't understand how batching works.
---
Healers are mostly certainly not "some of the best gold farmers", unless we're talking about a "Top 3 Roles for gold farming" list. 25g an hour is straight garbage, priests are the exception. Shaman can't farm a damn thing for good gold. Duo runs with a warrior in DM or fishing. Not sure about paly.
---
Hit as in the stat? Zg? I hope p4 doesn't mean phase4 since it's not going to be for a while xD
---
He's right, you know. Final fantasy would fit you much better.
---
I need them combo points.
---
Just tell him to do rain fire instead
---
Everyones waiting for ony head to go up for rallying cry for 6pm raid
---
Recklessness is also a pretty decent boost to melee on bosses.
---
As a tank I find UD the most difficult, only because keeping aoe dps alive is a pain.  Every other dungeon is a cakewalk to tank.
---
2H Tank is gonna be a rough time.  Frankly, 'threat issues' are solved by  learning how to utilise the toolkit of the defensive stance, 1h/shield warrior.  2h tank is a different set of abilities and concepts to consider and really gets difficult when you have so much aggro in packs.  If you're fighting 2 or 3 monsters it's not that bad but you really suffer from taking so much more damage.  Plus if you don't sit in defensive stance you take a LOT more damage and then if you DO go def stance you lose a lot of damage which kind of defeats the purpose of 2h tanking to begin with. 
---
IMO 2h tank only works when you outgear the content and the pulls are no more than 3 monsters at a time.
---
Killed world pvp and made wow pvp just a pillar hugging boring matchups..i see where hes coming from
---
You must be new to vanilla/classic
---
Lua has a memory limit, but I think it's in the gigabyte range. It's most likely impossible to hit it within normal play, even with bad addons, due to garbage collection. Macros are not special to Lua in any way, just a Blizzard implementation that feeds custom blocks of string into secure parse functions with a 255 character limit.
---
posts on reddit every day
---
calls people reddit neckbeards
---
Lol the projection is cute. Now dont you have some leveling to do before you get farmed next week?
---
Shadowburn is another debuff slot, though.  Nice finishers on trash, but won't have a lot of impact on bosses.
---
Spellbatching needs to be severely toned down. Also leewing.
---
Is there any loot besides first boss farm, tribute runs, and occasionally killing that one boss before the final boss? I’ve never done a full run. Killed that second to last boss for the healer boots, I think the tank needed something as well, and every other run is just a tribute run. The first boss I know has good caster bracers and maybe something else for other classes, but I’ve never seen groups trying to clear the whole instance.
---
The amount of warriors or capable healers that would rather not do a dungeon at all than tank/heal when it's obvious that the group wont find any tank/healer.     
---
Smh
---
Still down, if we cant login, we cant even connect to the server. No point posting what realm you on, doesnt make a difference in eu.
---
Edit: Ok I got it, basically ignore [battle.net](https://battle.net) launcher. Instead run the wow.exe directly, enter your [battle.net](https://battle.net) email and password and it works. Just keep trying, eventually it goes through. Took me about 8 tries
---
But flamestrike/coc has always been a thing
---
That’s good advice in general, but it would not help in the situation he described, as he went from 0 threat to pulling aggro with his first spell.
---
Warlocks are always desired because of the utility they provide to raids; healthstones, summons and CC/fear to name a few. They have great damage and don't have to worry about keeping their pets happy.
---
Hunters are great too, and they can still dish out great damage even when they're oom. With FD + Traps they can be incredibly useful in certain encounters and even help with a bit of offtanking due to their beefy pets. 
---
The big downside to Warlocks is the constant need to farm soul shards, and the lack of bag space for soul shards, but hunters experience similar restrictions with ammo. 
---
One good thing about leveling a Hunter is that most mail armor will go right to you (Unless a warrior wants it), while Warlocks essentially compete with Mages, Priests, Druids, Paladins and Shamans depending on the drop. That being said, Warlocks get a free mount at 40 and a significantly cheaper mount at 60 to balance the scales somewhat. 
---
Personally I'd roll a hunter, it feels like there's very few around and my last guild MC run had to call in a newbie 58~ hunter to grab the leaf since all the ones in the guild had it, but it's entirely up to you.
---
Tanking is not really more difficult mechanically than some DPS classes, I think.
---
The thing is that if something goes pear-shaped, you need to react and have your tools handy, and if you fail, they notice. Like the focus is on you.
---
A bad DPS is less noticeable than a bad tank or healer, even taking into account that wonderful and organized DPS can cover even the most inept tank.
---
thats what they just said
---
There's a tank in spell cleave? Groups I'm in go 3 mages, lock for eye, and priest to bubble eye. No joke the priest rarely even has to heal, although it's a huge plus if they have holy nova ofc
---
Anyone knows how to set up grid2 to just show healers mana? It has that functionality, but clicking the box does nothing.
---
2h tanking is more than viable for all dungeons in the game. If a warrior can't tank with a two-handed, either the rest of their gear is trash or they are.
---
It's all those 2 hander or DW tanks I tells ya
---
Hmm we not sell very well.
---
Me neither... fusion?
---
Fu-shun-haaaaaa!
---
Not cheating, although very frustrating. I still have fond memories of holding a point in Eye and having 4 enemy shaman come skipping up to me in formation, drop 16 totems, and all start channeling chain lightning. Like, how do you even stop that? Blizz doesn't care, because all four accounts are being paid for and there's no way to prove intent to sell the accounts. Why would Blizz be against people giving them more money?
---
I don’t understand how that worked, how did you see his coms?
---
LBRS is a 5 man dungeon, UBRS is the raid.
---
You should join a good guild.
---
edit: Somehow that is contentious.  We'll keep lowmanning and oneshotting every boss with ret healers and lowbies in greens, you stay in your gold sink guilds lmfao.
---
its 1 gold for 6 stacks of 55 water which lasts until I log off... unless you're actually too dumb to whisper a mage lol
---
Amazing dude was looking for this !Ty
---
Ubrs 15? Too bad that has changed, it's easy to solo heal ubrs in classic now
---
Can’t get in 😭
---
You can't fear undead warriors, they have 2-3 fear removers and interrupt. Gotta outlive them. Dot em up and sac VW.
---
UD rogues and mages, fear early to force wotf. And then count to five and fear again. It gets much better when you get deathcoil.
---
#nochanges
---
I was also surprised how easy mana management was on my mage during the first MC raid
---
I'll take things people misremember but feel the need to bitch as if they are an authority on the mechanic for 100 alex!
---
Warlocks are really good at dueling, the best in the game id say
---
And you didnt even cheese it by pulling him upstairs, nice work!
---
I pick a lot of fights on my druid because I can typically bounce if it isnt going my way.
---
They used to hand out 2 week bans left and right for this back in vanilla. I'll PayPal you $500 if you do this an don't receive a ban when the honor system drops. This isn't retail buddy.
---
Are those the same people making all the "12 year BRD clear but no complaints and plenty of friends made" posts? A lot of people have their ego's tied up in this game and can't handle that they didn't know what they were doing 15 years ago and still don't know now.
---
What is a good spec for leveling and being able to dps/tank
---
"Suddenly a wild Teremous the Devourer appears"
---
Druids. There are hardly any Druids on my realm of Razorgore.
---
They also voiced their useless opinion about it.
---
Expecting them to not potentially waste dozens of other people's time (which they will be doing once new content drops) isn't selfish. I'm thinking for the group, maybe you should read a fucking book, you ape.
---
DM:E with herb is extremely similar gp/h
---
I completely agree... Anything farmed exclusively in the open world with limited constraints is impossible to farm (black lotus for example). The effects of people using layering to farm is starting to wear off and prices are skyrocketing on anything you can't farm out of DM on my server....  If you didn't get to 60 in time to abusive layering and stack mats/gold your getting fucked.
---
I really wish they'd just launched more servers with closer to the 3,000 cap and just let people self regulate. But, no they didn't believe in classic. Thought people would leave in mass, so we got this shit.
---
level 54 alliance killing level 40 horde.  
---
Level 40 horde typing in general chat asking for help.   
---
OP helps and kills level 54 alliance.  
---
OP and level 40 horde getting ganked are the same faction
---
if you lose to frost mages, but not to warriors/rogue, than you are probably with the worst possible warriors/rogues
---
Someone should try to hit those limits in WoW...
---
Once you are inside that doesn't matter
---
That is true.
---
I feel like you and I are leveling at the same pace. Awesome as always.
---
You can just run past all the garbage mobs and reset them. What does he do with the level 40s? Or can he master loot from the entrance?
---
I havent played a Druid since Wrath, but I try to have single target heals on shift+L/R click, HOTS on shift and the mouse side buttons, then ALT plus the mouse buttons are for AoE heals, cleanses go on shift and mousewheel up/down.
---
Not everyone is unemployed and it's not like that massive amount of time you save can't be used to do other things with guildies. I would say a part time job would be having to spend more time to accomodate your spec. Kind of like a daycare.
---
Clearly you understood what I meant, that wasn’t your initial problem.
---
For warriors at least, get an int buff. It helps with the speed at which you level weapon skills.
---
Retail and Classic share all the same legal documents and rules enforcement. We've already seen major cross-faction collusion is allowed in Classic in the form of Devilsaur farming. But sure, I'll take your $500.
---
Im so jealous my guild has only been able to down 3 bosses and i have 2/8 earthfury.
---
So you're mad because people aren't catering to your playstyle, which appears to be "running around BRD aimlessly for 4 hours while nobody gets geared."
---
Pve servers yes alliance is more popular. Pvp servers it's all horde because they think WOTF is a free win.
---
Holy crap that works mid jump to arrest motion?
---
The low pop servers are bigger than the largest vanilla servers. It's had all sorts of unintended consequences. Just try farming thorium in the open world, good luck. "Devilsaur mafia" behavior would of never been a problem on original size servers. There's so many weird economic effects caused by the size of the servers. Not to mention there's like 30+ guilds clearing MC on each side of every server. The game doesn't feel anything like vanilla in any aspect at this point.
---
*Unzips pants*, you are now
---
There's actually plenty of alliance 60s on Herod, and they generally group well and fight often.  Since the announcement of p2 quite a bit of raid v raid wpvp has been going on, and over the last couple of days every large scale fight I've personally been in had an alliance number advantage.
---
I know it was having negative consequences, but as someone who loves data this makes me sad.
---
I understand that line of thinking but when everyone else is paying to respec for the benefit of the raid it’s a bit of a mooch attitude to refuse to change.
---
This is why they added badge gear in heroic dungeons in BC. Gave people a reason to keep running the dungeons, and guaranteed that you would eventually get the gear you wanted instead of praying for a drop.
---
Yes p4 means phase 4. And yes hit as in the stat.
---
Warlocks gain no hit stat through talents and they need 16% to be hit capped. Miss 1/7 spells... Wooooo!
---
and other times the boss resists 3-4 bolts in a row while the other lock hits 3-4 crits in the same time.
---
A good warrior is one of the hardest things to beat imo. That and druids were OP in vanilla pvp.
---
I am stuck at trying to log into battlenet.
---
"lol" all you want kiddo. I'd rather you keep your mentality so you'll continue to be butt hurt whenever someone else wins a roll that will help them too (who can't use the gold you get from selling items?).
---
Ruin becomes a bigger increase in damage when you drop corruption.
---
I’d probably go Orc or Undead Rogue and Orc or Undead Warlock. Very strong for 1v1’s and world pvp.
---
Yeah, 50% iirc. You have to pull him in right as the cave opens up
---
*go down swinging
---
What is the point of this video
---
Out of curiosity how much tier 1 do you have?
---
It is very close and up to personal preference. Both classes usually fill the spot of ranged dps if you cant get mages in 5mans and you only have a couple of each class in raid. And both their preraid bis have some annoying items to get but its probably harder for warlocks.
---
SL warlock
---
Griefing
---
The biggest primadonnas are the people who think other players should perform a role they  clearly don't enjoy just to please you
---
That's about as entitled as it gets
---
Would a Warrior struggle to get kills as it levelled up? Obviously kiting aside if the Warrior is on his own, do you think he could match up sub 60?
---
What’s the joke about shadowlands? I’ve heard people mention it a few times but I don’t understand what they mean
---
Ashbringer
---
People are just used to the TBC and layer version of fear where it's random. Wasn't that way in vanilla. Working as intended.
---
Ur ui gave my eyes cancer
---
Spriest ... Is the king of all PvP just google why
---
Not really. I have been burned by too many idiot dps to ever tank again in non guild raid situations. Yall are pricks.
---
If it wouldnt be for the cheapshotting rogues, extra pack pulling on purpose or AoEing before they reach me DPS I would still tank dungeons.
---
Tanking is not fun with mages using frost nova or rogues cheapshotting mobs. I have 0 rage to get any threat.
---
It’s just gameplay
---
Random speculation, but I believe I’ve read Alliance have less Warlocks and S Priests in PvP than Horde, simply because the Forsaken and WotF exist. Solid reason to go Orc?
---
Yeah he can find a group of affliction warlocks, Ret paladins/enhancement shaman/moonkin/cb prep/arms warriors.
---
It's just a matter of finding people with the same mindset to play with.
---
I would rather play with people who respect the effort others put in and put in an equal amount of effort though.
---
Multiboxing is not cheating. Selling accounts I think is though, so if you can prove that one...
---
Tonight I achieved a goal of mine; to get 8/8 Shaman T1. I can confirm that the 5/5 set bonus and the 8/8 set bonus synergize! The mana return "Mana Surge" procs VERY often and is a huge bonus now that my Healing Wave spells proc 3 times per cast.
---
As you can see, on the Majordomo fight it gained me 3182 mana! That is absolutely insane!
---
Thanks to my guild &lt;Omega&gt; for giving me a stable raid spot for the past 6 weeks.
---
Not cheating and can't be reported since Blizzard loves money. But in practice it's similar to buying gold, leveling boosting services, and always rolling around in a group for PvP. Pay to win and to be looked down on.
---
And the answer is that raid lockouts are completely separate from dungeon lockouts. So yes, you can enter MC even while being locked out from BRD due to hitting the limit.
---
Rend
---
It's a female character in the picture...
---
Opinions are all useless because they’re opinions dumbass
---
Okay then just ignore the opinion why are you so fucking upset about it?
---
Do you have any recs in which dungeons to run to get 52-60?
---
Revenge, avenge
---
Only 1 mage gets high damage.  Really mages are still below warriors and rogues, it's just that all the mages crits get assigned to one mage.
---
You're the ultimate neckbeard if you're taking even a second of your time looking through someone else's post history. How insecure can you get?
---
Dude's got a spider on his chest... you think your Spiderman? Miles Morales? Pfft. You're not that kind of Orc. :p
---
You better have rerolled tank after that comment.
---
I'd put LBRS above DM:E.   DM:E is easy.  (Just have to be careful with patrols.  
---
You need to get yourself shield, even LBRS is tough on damage.  The issues you are having with threat is due to dps not understanding how threat works and just going full bore on your pull.
---
Naxx is harder than AQ40, but not that much harder, and I think people will be geared enough to handle the increased difficulty. 
---
The cold harsh reality of real life when the reach the end of Classic content is what will slap people in the face.
---
i'm not gonna tank for a group of fury warriors who refuse to perform the intended role for their class while also rolling on the gear i need
---
if you want to dps, there are plenty of classes designed for that. if you want to dps as a warrior, go for it but understand that you may get made fun of by strangers on the internet and if that offends you too much, stay off the internet lol
---
Today, the playerbase playing Classic I'd argue is a very different one from what we had 15 years ago. Everything about the game is searchable with extensive resources available to anyone who Googles it, what the best specs/talents are, with entire and complete levelling guides for every aspect of the game.
---
The days of outright meme specs are just simply over. I'd also venture to say, the days of not knowing where to sink a talent point because someone's just completely and outright clueless, are likewise gone. This is a 15-year old game. The majority know what they are doing and why.
---
And we chose to spec arms and tank with it, spec shadow and yet heal in dungeons, and of course spec feral for the most efficient way to level, and yet tank/heal with it. Some of us also feel *it is no one's business by our own*, how we chose to play the game.
---
I daresay it's even enhanced privacy to boot, if we have the ability to disable the ability of an addon to snoop on your talent spec. Yes different guilds have different requirements, but that's going off on another big topic.
---
Awww your class doesn’t have a spell that works 100% of the time all the time?
---
My baby goes to bed at 7 or 8pm and wakes up at 7am. She also wakes up once in the middle of the night to eat, so I go to bed around 10 or 11 in order to get a full night's sleep. 
---
So assuming I have literally nothing else to do that's about 3 hours a day to play WoW, but of course between chores, hanging with spouse, social events, etc, the available time narrows pretty fast
---
Oh shit, i for some reason thought one was horde and one was alliance.
---
Why did you post this? It should be titled:
---
“Me playing the game!”
---
Shit... has it really got that bad huh? Shouldn't have to lie about your spec.
---
It's pretty ironic though, I hope those people who are too anal about spec aren't in the "No change" crowd. Especially the kind that thinks that retails "talent *system*" is garbage. "Player choice should matter" yeah... I mean, people should be barred from raiding if they don't choose thier cookie cutter talents that are best for class role. That's still choice if you have to follow a strict formula... right? No?
---
Also ironically, chances are those assessing you won't be able to actually understand why the min-max cookie cutter specs are as such.
---
"Dud, shit priest, Y U hav silent resolve?"
---
"Why? Isn't reducing my threat good"
---
"Nah, you don't need it L2Priest brah"
---
"Explain why don't I need it? Fades on a 30 sec CD, that talent makes it so I don't need it as often. Maybe when im lvl 60 and have confidence in tanks maybe ill put the points elsewhere"
---
"You just don't scrub fuk! Go to MinMax4Scrubs.com and follow the build all the pros use."
---
If someone knows what they are talking about though, I'll listen. I'm not the most knowledgeable but I can tell when people know what they are talking about.
---
If you send money or items to a character that is not on your account the warning will pop up.
---
Also it's incredibly frustrating when there's a bunch of retail kids who will start AOEing or not target your target then say you're a shit tank as a warrior because you don't have instant AOE threat 🙃
---
"I don't tank" is easier to say than explaining I need threat before they open about 10 times per dungeon
---
you have to feed them. most of them kill you drive by and hope you waste time, few actually camp an area. camping means fighting, something they are not able to do. or they are just stupid and get counter camped afterwards :D
---
I don't want you to die but I also don't want you life tapping non stop. You do have other options. :P
---
5 mans, not very much.  Raiding requires 9% at 300 so you don't miss because you are fighting lvl 63 mobs.
---
Yeah pretty much
---
Lolol
---
Hope they start servers from 0 with every add on and leave the old versions in less but merged servers ... I will quit my abo the day I am forced to play tbc or anything later.
---
Don’t make me get my maiiiiiiiiiiiiin!
---
jag saknar dig, saknar dig min bror  
---
Jag sa jag saknar dig, mer än vad du tror
---
Yeah, in a world where calling out bigotry and racism is considered white knighting. Nice username pal.
---
Hope you and your fucking ilk die and rot. Have a good one.
---
5% for same level mobs. at 305, you shouldn't need more than 2%
---
At higher ranks it's a slight positive and tap you have to spec. Regardless, his main point was the dps loss of using time to drain which absolutely holds true
---
Sounds like a great nature guild! Been looking for one. Which server?
---
It's way overblown just keep an eye out and ride to another area of you see the opposite faction and do another quest.
---
Same with Bene. It's has a 50% drop rate so just run MC enough with your guild and you'll get it soon enough.
---
I've seen it drop several times at this point.
---
I haven’t done end game. So no. The outpouring of unpleasantness this sub shows me about it lets me feel good about wallowing in my alts and their mediocrity.
---
I'm a druid tank and I find dm:n (trib or otherwise) ezpz.
---
I'd say that scholo is one of the harder ones, followed by strat UD, but once you're pre-BIS, none of them are particularly challenginv
---
Okay so you had a hard time finding a group for a very long run with specific objectives.
---
That isn't really surprising.
---
BRD is not meant to be a full run really, it has chunks.
---
This has nothing to do with people min maxing and everything to do with dungeon design.
---
It's like STV. Everyone said it would be an absolute bloodbath and I've been able to avoid most pvp. Nowhere near what ppl were making it out to be.
---
Oh what’s your guild? Also whitemane horde mage lol
---
Not pulling threat is a big part of the dps' job.  If you are marking a focus target that you have good threat on and enough threat to hold healing threat on tertiary targets, you're doing your job.  If the dps is blowing cooldowns and pulling threat, or attacking the wrong target that isn't your fault.
---
I don’t care if they do it in pve. Frustrating but understanding. Being one shot in pvp? Should be considered cheating. Wish multiboxing was restricted to pve servers.
---
gz man
---
i can use the gold i get from BoP plate items too, but we all greed for those. great logic idiot. i dare you to need on bop items and tell your group and tell you group "who can't use the gold you get from selling items?" and see how quick everyone leaves lol
---
You should never ever assume there are 5 competent people in the group. Healer should gear up on spirit (scrolls, food, whatever) and stock up on drinks, cause someone will most definitely do something stupid along the way. Always remember though, "No wipe, no foul."
---
You realize this is a forum right? Every comment section is filled with useless opinions.
---
Nothing. It's boring as shit.
---
Game ruining garbage anyone who does this should be banned
---
&gt; which they will be doing once new content drops
---
So not related to the current game at all lmfao.
---
*ape*
---
as it should be
---
wtf is this image lol, amazing
---
I havnt been scammed since world 2 fally park 
---
Learned my lesson the hard way but I learned it well
---
That’s the change - a ton more killing from people casually leveling for now. I’ll be 60 by then but without even dungeon gear I assume. I do have 3 alts at 35, 25, and one started this morning at 15. I wanted at least two or three 60s before this. I could’ve easily done it, now the ganking will be groups of people running around doing it on purpose. Currently I’ve been able to quest probably doing the same quest as alliance right next to each 90% of the time.
---
Amen brother
---
I have been saving my dkp waiting for the priest t2 to drop and it just never does, same with the mage t2.
---
You are free to believe that the healers mana is earmarked for anyone but the tank. I would not want to raid with you though
---
With honor right around the corner mining should see a pretty big bump, especially thorium. I recently went through same as you and switched to mining engineering since I have most big items purchased and an epic mount. Time to focus on the pvp !
---
I pull when the mage is oom so I can get aggro.
---
But what if it's an authentic Hitler shitpost?
---
12h a day O_o wtf
---
A lot of people will use the easier option. Sad to say, unless it's an import code.. nobody wants to set it up. Even though it's pretty easy itself...
---
&gt;a meme spec or two
---
How did you even come to that? Why shouldn't everyone be pvp or meme specced if it's allowed?
---
I'm not in a bleeding edge zerg guild either, I was simply stating why I can see how guilds would enforce that if they wanted to spend less of their free time raiding. Our guild doesn't enforce specs and I'd never join one that does. I also have time to raid and my job is super relaxed and independent so I don't care if it takes longer and I'm a bit tired the next day.
---
I don't get why you're trying to insult me now, it sounds like you're very upset over something that doesn't even affect you since you seem to avoid those guilds.
---
That's not RNG. That's a deterministic reward structure like the heroic badges from TBC. 
---
I'm all for those kinds of systems honestly. Do a better job, get rewarded.
---
Is that supposed to be an argument or point you're trying to make?
---
The slow thing doesnt exist in classic. That was added in TBC
---
Did you skip poisons?
---
If you’re in a group of 4 as a DPS warrior and are taking more than a few minutes looking for a tank, you’re a selfish jackass sorry.
---
This cracked me up cuz it’s so true. When I’m running solo, I have no regard for danger because I have fed and can rez my pet. I have to temper my wild heathen self when I run with groups.
---
if they're killings mobs I need there's no mercy, if they're not ill attack if they try to gank a faction member otherwise I'll let them be
---
Where do i post about guild recrutments? I saw a daily post about that but they ended it or something cause i cant find one of this day or of yesterday
---
I am a rogue lol and thank you for list!
---
The 2004-2006 server caps were still a fraction of what we have on Classic. Add on top of that the fact that people have access to mountains more information about how/where/when to farm what, and you have incredibly scarcity. The resource competition is far more fierce now.
---
Is it really bad etiquette to life tap and eat instead of drinking? I usually always do it because I have way more food that water. Didn't know this was frown upon.
---
Y'all are crazy if you think any Classic Content is going to slap anyone in the face that's played retail WoW. Modern day Mythic instances are harder than ANYTHING in Classic. Ppeople have to remember guilds struggled to coordinate Chromaggus back then. That shit is a absolute joke by today's standards. 
---
It's even easier now with how advanced addons are DBM makes everything a joke.
---
People are going to slap every content patch in a week.
---
I used to use altohaulic it has everything you wanna know about alts and it shows where you have duplicate items on alts. Not sure if it works on classic though
---
Except it can miss and only works for one mob because of the 6 sec CD.
---
I’ve always wondered as someone who has little experience playing casters, what’s the difference between locks and mage? Play style, favourable matchups etc? They seem very similar at first to my inexperienced eye. One fears and one polys, one fears more and the other slows and snares
---
retail has a bit more variety in the raids, just saying
---
Fear usually disrupts
---
Indeed!  Watching the downvotes from the salty wars is good enough for another /laughs in druid.
---
You just got rocked, he just rocked you.
---
I dont play hunter so i dont know, but what would make you sweat?
---
Not the same thing, turd burglar. You're obviously looking for people to console you after you lost something fair and square. Done arguing with you. Have a great day champ.
---
Lol on your server maybe. Horde and alliance aren’t working together on anything on Thalnos. The horde wouldn’t even do a wpvp event with us.
---
“Hey guys what’s that logo from?”
---
“World of Warcraft”
---
“Uhhh ok”
---
Sometimes I forget lol
---
Backtracking on what? Please point out where I ever said my guild was like that. I even said I would never spec check anyone so apparently you have reading difficulties as well. It doesn't sound like you're very stable, it seems you have real mental issues and should seek help.
---
Do you have Details? Enable TinyThreat, create a second window, and you can track threat on your target as well as your uber leet dps.
---
A prot/arms warrior needs to be level 46-50 before they get all their points in tactical mastery, which means they can easily maintain rage after charge and switching to defensive stance. Watch for the shield to appear over their head, and watch debuffs. A warrior will sometimes pop shieldblock on charge so revenge gets activated for extra threat.
---
A fury/prot warrior is a lot harder at opening with threat since they never get tactical mastery and stance dancing will always empty their rage bar. They usually open with a ranged pull instead of a charge.
---
I've had about 4 healers drop because I do this. Lots of people demand full mana first
---
The fact that you didn't get the boomer joke meaning anyone who's older than a Fortnite kid is a boomer confirms you are indeed very boomer, boomer
---
Lol you’re so confused and mad. I’m not against op. I thought you were though. You didn’t make it clear you weren’t. I’m the asshole but you’re the one that so easily resorts to petty name calling.
---
Personally I'd just make money with tailoring and buy the mats to level engineering if I already had tailoring maxed out with patterns. Mining takes a lot longer than farming gold and is way less effective than just buying what you need.
---
Dick behavior?? Bro I could kill then and make them gy walk too lol.
---
But your not wrong, undead rogue hahahahhaha 👍
---
If it's one mob, you're the scrub for not banking rage from autos and just taunting after stun ends for threat. If the mob goes back to the rogue after, who cares? It's about to die anyway because its a 5 man and enemies live for less than 10 seconds.
---
If you're rage starved you have to l2p and not waste threat/rage on mobs that will die anyway.
---
They do, but only to the dead pvp server.
---
I am the authoritheeeey

Does anyone know (and I mean really know, I'm tired of guesses) how the 5/hr dungeon lockout works?  I was doing some tests, and my 1st run started at 2.52 and my 6th run started at 3.55 (over an hour later) and it still told me I was locked out.
---
I dont think you comprehend what healthy population means if you think seeing this many people, while you still have layers, is healthy... 
---
The server is overpopulated, and will probably have a wonky economy. 
---
Most people didnt have issues on servers back in vanilla" and the medium classic servers have more people on them now than the full ones did back then.
---
HOWEVER, some of the most in demand world resources are just as scarce and contested. 
---
Its rough.
---
I haven’t died to one yet...
---
There's been no pvp system bro. Of course theres been little pvp. There is literally no reason to kill anyone until next week.
---
Sorry that I don't think your guild getting lucky on an early recipe entitles someone to make 10s of thousands of gold lmao.... You wanna argue that someone who farms a dungeon for a flask/armor/weapon recipe should make some gold crafting it, 100% agree. Getting lionheart recipe is the equivalent of winning the lottery. You think the jackasses who win the lottery earned the gold? Fuck off
---
The differences are in the nuances. I believe Polymorph is more of a reset for the Mage, as damage breaks it. Whilst fear only breaks on a threshold of damage. Also, slows and snares are counters to melee, whilst more fears are good against most classes. 
---
Then you got stuff like VW Shield vs Ice Barrier. Overall, Mages are more about dishing it but avoid taking it. Warlocks are about dishing it, but combating what they take. 
---
Then you introduce a Spriest into the equation, and it becomes even more muddled. :)
---
Yes for Warlocks, no to sPriests. Alliance has insane amounts of dwarf shadow priests since they have a fovorable mirror matchup against the Forsaken priests.
---
It's early in vanilla still, I'm in mostly non raid gear and half the time a pvp fight for me is fear the guy, put up dots, wait 10 seconds for him to die without me doing any extra nuking. SL definitely has the damage to kill people in pvp while being hard to kill.
---
Killing MC boss Golemagg as a 2H Fury Warrior and producing 443 DPS. It's a pretty interesting build and thought some might like to see how viable it is when raiding. I hope you enjoy!
---
lol, half the responses are shit stains like you excusing the shitty behavior, and half are adults who recognize shitty behavior when they see it. good to know i fall into the latter group, but sad to know your shitty attitude is so rampant. have a good evening little child. go back to your level 31 like you know what you're talking at all
---
Firemaw
---
Yeah there's a handful of MC fights that are just unfavorable to melee, but even in trash pulls I'm keeping up with them pretty good. This meme is really painting affliction locks to be a lot worse than they really are is basically all I was trying to say
---
But not really sorry.
---
Paladins
---
The shadowlands is where you go when you die. You're in it when your spirit runs back to your corpse.
---
Literally tens of us
---
I'm 60 orc lock and sometimes you notice when you resist a stun and can tell it fucks whoever you're fighting. Sometimes you get no resists even though you're stunned a bunch of times in a row, so the racial was effectively worthless. Orc is great if you don't mind rng playing part of whether you win fights against stun classes, or whether you would rather control the fear break against fear classes.
---
But then comes in the cat and mouse problem of bot users knowing the methods that catch them (they would inevitably be published in viewable media as a money/ item making guide)
---
and being able to divert extra time to securing against those methods.
---
Just take a look at old threads in a RS botting community, they did that already, why make it more transparent for them?
---
This is from 2005

52-55 BRD is great, 55-57 Lbrs, then 57-60 you can do strat, scholo and the dire mauls.
---
I dunno, to me it's seemed like everything is being run at 60. Can't think of anything I don't see often in the LFG channel.
---
BRD gets broken into smaller runs and it might be tougher to find a full run right now though but when I needed specific things there I just set up my own group with the LFG message stating what i wanted to do and found people pretty easy.
---
Overgearing though is a thing.
---
My wife was fine with me nerding out a few times in the wedding from having through raid nights in our vows to playing the Pokémon theme song for the garter toss!
---
if class balance was on the tbc pre patch we would have tbc talents
---
Mages make melee hate their classes with the fury of a thousand suns. Locks make people hate fear with the fury of a thousand suns. Both are fun, mages have better mobility, locks have better survivability.
---
Did anyone try working with fellow locks and shadow priests to get Skul? In like 7 runs of experimentation we couldn't even get him to spawn, but at least we can check back gate spawn very quickly with just two people and the main gate spawn would be unreachable anyway.
---
That's what raid logs are for.
---
Don't need Details! for that and people almost never use it for that reason.
---
There was so much collusion in vanilla. We’d both queue ab/wsg. Take the opposite and spam through the rep.
---
Shoot!
---
Mages are better against melee because blink is broken, warlocks are better against casters because pets push back spell casting.
---
According to your logic ppl havent been killing each other out there......
---
It’s honestly too easy as a lock. It literally only depends on getting the fear off to win, and even if you don’t you still have a chance with that high stam and survivability. I main rogue and even though we can shut down people relatively easy, it completely blew my mind the first time I started leveling my lock. So unbelievably easy and efficient, and almost impossible to lose in pvp if you start on equal footing.   
---
Fear, 1, 2, 3 hmmmm ok I’m dominating lol whoops my imp wasn’t even attacking! Oh he’s coming back? Fear, hmmm what other moves should I use? I’m not even sure I have so many. Well I’m only at 85% health so maybe I’ll... but I need more soul shards as well.. - ope he’s dead forgot I was in a battle.
---
The strategy is to grind and farm on a dead server and once they release paid realm transfers, which they certainly will, you transfer. Boom, you made a ton of gold without much competition and all it cost was $20-30.
---
Everything will be harder than LBRS.  
---
Go 1h +shield. dont focus on tanking everything. concucssion blow one, and dont waste time on it, let it run, tank the 2 other mobs, otherwise just peel off your dps at that point. 
---
2H will make it harder for you tanking.
---
A good warlock beats all, a shit shadow priest beats most, a legendary rogue beats all except a warlock.
---
In what types of fights do you think it would make sense to use one set over the other? Thanks for your insight
---
Guilds trying to compete on clear times will generally have all people in the raid be the best possible spec.
---
If you're in a pug or in a guild that doesn't really care about everyone doing the best they possibly can, you'll find people are more lax.
---
sounds like the plan
---

---
This is changes, we want NO changes. This is Blizzard's way of saying "look how shit Classic is, come to retail and be a good, little paypig."
---
It's that thing that warriors have that makes it easymode to tank as a warrior ... :P
---
I say that as someone who has both a prot/arms war and a prot/holy pally tanks.... Tanking as my warrior is sooo fucking easy compared to the tankadin. Like holy shit is it easy. Lol.
---
....which managing my health and mana, like my whole entire point has been, would be. 
---
Jesus, the Iq of the average redditor is on the floor.
---
Smiling as you try to brag on reddit... nice life bro
---
It’s really only common here on Reddit. Everyone of my friends on other servers all seem to agree that its ninja looting.
---
Fury warriors have the highest DPS in the game. You’re the dick here, let people play what they want to play.
---
ESPECIALLY when they’re playing very optimally already...
---
Fortitude them before jumping off clear for more chances of them dying to fall damage.
---
Maybe ...  It has higher dps, but no stats iirc so they probably balance out in terms of single target dps.
---
The proc, while cool as hell and fun at first, can become really annoying sometimes. 
---
Ravager i'd say is definitely better in dungeons, either dps'ing or 2h tanking.
---
Mograine's Might from cathedral might be a better solo option is you aren't set on axes.
---
Sounds like you’re on the wrong discord.
---
I get what you are saying, an experienced tank would be able to turn the downside of bloodfury into a good tradeoff for the benefit he gains within its duration, be that increased aggro to allow dps to go ham, or maybe fighting a boss which won't even be able to kill him without getting heals for the duration of the fight.
---
At this point however, we are talking about the kind of tank who knows their limits and the risk involved with using bloodfury - those tanks are always nice to have.
---
I have more karma than you bro does that make me better?  By your standards, yes.  Get some karma bro then we can talk.
---
As a healer I find DM West the hardest of the DM runs, the damage output of the ghosts/spectres/banshees is really high and the voids can burn all your mana in a second.
---
On the other hand, regarding strat live, we couldnt find a tank in one hour so we just 4 maned it with no tank. Went smooth as butter, only one wipe due to a stupid avoidable mistake inside the cathedral.
---
"I love right-click report, I love no unarmored mounts, I love BFA trade window, I love warning on CoD sends, I love BFA pathing, I love incorrect batching and leeway, I love when people are trading gold for raid items under the table, I love hyper accelerated Classic timeline." Cool, bro.
---
Imagine being this entitled oh my lawd.
---
Stay mad and stay bad, kid
---
I'll spam searing whatever on my lock (the one that has the extra threat) to get mobs off the healer, then drag it to the tank so the healer doesn't have to stop casting to drag it himself.
---
you don't have to do it from far away and you could do it with flamestrike and cone of cold which has no travel time.
---
Diremaul is annoying as fuck to tank
---
Just because “it’s always been that way” doesn’t mean people can’t complain about it.
---
And it's no wonder. It's way more work and responsibility than DPS, especially if DPS doesn't watch themselves
---
When you max the Air stat in Tony Hawk

Dude just buy a gaming mouse and use modifiers. Every single key can be easily and effortlessly accessed with a single press of a key from each hand at the worst.
---
yeah what trep said, pets can leave you if you dont take care of them. they have a meter of happiness which also dictates there damage. Green is happy doing 125% damage, yellow is neutral doing 100% dmg, and orange is unhappy doing 75%, nothing is below that so b e warned your pet can leave you after that!
---
Only in group PvP with healing. 1 v 1 they’re downright weak and are easily beat by most classes. Ever watch a good frost mage and a warrior duel?
---
It's still an absolute abuse of the honor system and should absolutely a bannable offense.
---
I mean I’m 5 mans.
---
I never ever get outdps'd on my lock or rogue by a warrior. "BEsT DPS CLasS" is when you are running BWL+. Warriors need to learn how to put on a shield until raids so everyone else can get gear.
---
Let me quote you one more time;
---
"Your exp =/= everyone else’s"
---
Hypocrisy isn't a good look my dude. It takes literally half a minute of searching to find plenty of people who experienced it both ways.
---
Yeah, seriously. The only memes that get thrown at Warriors is for having a tough time leveling or getting kited.
---
Now Ret Paladin or Balance Druid, be ready for some flame.
---
My guild has yet to see the bracers, belt or chest piece drop :|
---
An easy renew on a tapping lock keeps things moving nicely
---
Open bid system?
---
Savages
---
On single target, I'll do charge -&gt; def stance, bloodrage, shield block, revenge. Sunder only happens if I can't revenge and am close to losing the mob, revenge is my protwar's go-to for threat.
---
That's how it worked for a long time
---
Depends on your server balance. Mine is 2 horde for each alliance, so i'm not looking forward to the pvp patch at all.
---
Dot up golemagg's adds for extra nightfall proccs bring mana pots and runes to not waste gcds life tapping and memorize the tapping rotation gg you're #1 dps.
---
Sm ruin is way funner in wpvp than ds since you can actually bring a pet and dots will chew through anyone that can't dispel. Raid spec is fine and all but being completely helpless out in the world sucks
---
As a mage, I have never not out dps’d a same level dps warrior.
---
DKP. It has been working great! Although we are changing to LC from now on.
---
We wiped about four times but didn't let it frustrate us. We did get Archaedas down, for a glorious +agi and +spi ring 🙄🙄🙄🙄
---
It's a shame that place can be so difficult because the Indiana Jones encounter is *still* so amazingly cool to watch.
---
I ve farmed my epic tiger on a gnome mainly with ZF (around 2200 gold), got 8 epic boes so far, none of them good though. Mage weave tailoring into essences is where some nice extra dough is at. :)
---
In a 1v1 rogues can start the fight with 5 free combo points by combining sap and cheap shot into expose armor. Makes clothies unable to do anything.
---
Other than that Ele shamans can practically one combo most people
---
Indeed *moo*
---
Lol I never said I care about karma, but at this point I’m just feeding the troll.
---
Only if you don't read the keyword "little"
---
Us Druid tanks love you too. I think we all want to see just how high that health cap can get
---
Warriors aren't even that great on DPS until they have raid gear. You guys are reserving items, joining every group available, just to get niche items to compete with my regular geared rogue/lock. "Highest dps" in the game doesnt even come until having some BWL gear.
---
And it was garbage. The #nochanges community want to complain, they can fuck off back to pservers. I’d be happy to see them go.
---
We do dkp also but it’s blind biding
---
Dont lose faith! 😊
---
The game is running on 1.12. You would need an example from late 2006
---
Grats man! :D
---
Are people overblowing the “insanity” that will be world PvP next week? I’m leveling an alt right now and don’t know what to actually expect when honor is introduced.
---
I only got 3 and it’s killing my OCD
---
They should be wiped every time you log, no?
---
There’s assholes in classic too, don’t worry. Luckily they’re all in one guild on my server so they’re pretty much on their own.
---
You seem a lot more triggered than me tbh. I'm only saying you shouldn't be a dick about it and each of your responses is more condescending than the last.
---
vanilla was never great because of all the loot and talent choices etc... like there was always a best talent build for each spec, and there was a bis list even if it was wrong (e.g. need 440 defense to tank MC/Ony). i've killed angerforge 30 times, a lot of those were full runs with friends/guildies while i was 60 and they were in their 50s, maybe the last 10 were arena/anger/golem runs to farm hoj/second wind for people. when i run stuff, it usually starts with, "alright, who's got something to run tonight". so, like, go find people you like playing with because you're saying everyone sucks and that's not true.
---
How long does this 16 slot debuff cap remain a thing?
---
Do you farm mara or dm? Herbalism 
---
If you answered no to the above, mining.
---
Oh, hehe well there is no drama between us so its all fine
---
P2 hits stick to instances. I read there is a gape from late 40-52 where you have to quest then you can run dungeons till 60 if u feel open world is too hostile. 
---
Best of luck 53 here atm gotta p-p-p-puush it
---
Basically player kills will have value in phase 2 so you just need to expect that people are going to kill you if you're on a pvp server
---
&gt;	imagine being this entitled 
---
The irony staggers me lmao
---
Eh. My prot arms warrior is 27 and has 5/5 tactical mastery. Just gotta spend those points well. You don't have to spend straight into prot to tank well at low levels. I kinda alternated points for a bit. I have the improved bloodrage as well, but gonna get anger management then the rest is gonna be in prot.
---
I spent prot points until I got imp bloodrage, then I spent arms.
---
But yeah, I almost always pop shield block after a charge for that sweet revenge threat.
---
I always feel bad when I see a NE Priest. They’ll forever be subpar.
---
Cute, 1 account.
---
&gt; It let's you know who is dispelling and who isn't. It let's you figure out what is killing people.
---
You really don't need an addon for either of these things.  What's killing people is easy to see by paying attention to the actual fight that's happening on the screen and if you need an addon to get people to dispel you must be raiding with toddlers.
---
Doesn't count if you're in Stormwind!!
---
Its gonna be great honestly, exactly what hes complaining about is going to be completely exposed.
---
Came here to say this. Once they can walk it's all over, you can only play while they sleep.

So then you cherish naps, but mine grew out of naps by 2.5.
---
My buddy has a ten man 5 warlock - 5 Spriests multibox
---
Watching him walk through zones is amazing, just one shotting people
---
The saddest part for me is, the Warrior tanks I have grouped up with were horrible. Slowest runs I've ever been on and they couldn't hold aggro even when DPS gave them a solid 4 or 5 seconds before doing anything.
---
My main couple of characters are tanks and it's the role I prefer, so it's only a problem on alts, but I've reached a point where I'll avoid Warrior tank groups if I can.
---
Why?  Even if the range of the jumps is the same as Chain Heal, which I doubt, the better coefficient on Healing Wave is at minimum being mitigated by the insane depreciation of healing power per jump relative to Chain Heal, and that's without 3 and 5 set tier 2 (and better stats even for healing) being factored in.
---
And everyone else can face the cold hard truth that 50%+ will be paying child support for 18 years..
---
You can have 2 crusaders up at the same time. Dont know if its a bug, and if it is, idk if its been fixed since i havnt logged in for a week. On private servers it was the way you described.
---
But if its orange cant you just spam feed the fuck out of it until it is happy?
---
If it's not a big deal, why not follow##nochanges?
---
Anything that goes against no changes needs to have a really good reason
---
"when I hit 60 I sold all my tank gear, I dont do that shit"
---
Then pulls terrible DPS, lol  
---
We also have a warrior tank who will NOT group with any DPS warriors on our server lol
---
I disagree for that last part, if you level a decent portion from questing, a mount is definitely worth a few hours of farming, won't even be that much as  long as you dont spend excessively in you 30s.
---
Well I've always been an advocate of classic+.
---
Start by fixing some base systems and classes, put in gbanks, take away dishonorable kills, some rated BGs without rewards. 
---
Then they can sprinkle in class questlines and karazhan or grim batol or emerald dream or whatever as they see fit
---
If they don't do this in a year, then they might move to shadowlands. It might not be an amazing expansion but they seem to be fixing some of the retail problems and vanillizing the game
---
it's been 7 weeks. :| I've been in 5 piece since week 2 of raiding lol. I'd love to try out 8 piece
---
I’ve healed an UBRS in which almost every character was an orc and has blood rage bound to a rotation key. They would use it as I was casting a 3-second heal on them. So frustrating.
---
?? 
---
Yeah mabye in overall damage for an aoe dungeons but for specific single target im pretty sure warrior is top. A rouge with the rank 14 sword might be able to get on there, but thats about it
---
The macro looks fine as you’ve typed it here. Can you copy and paste it here to be 100% sure?
---
Don't even need a macro, it's an ability in your spell book. Also you get a pop-up and have to confirm before you can abandon.
---
big time boomer post. 
---
remember when we were bad at the game because we didn’t try as hard? those were the good old days. 
---
throw on mismatched shitty gear that looks cool at continue to wipe in mc for hours if that’s what you prefer.
---
people been saying that for a decade. dead meme.
---
As a Prot Paladin I've never lost in dps to a Warrior... people are forgetting that Fury Warriors are only great DPS in specific end game situations. lol
---
I'm of the opinion that is fucked up, but it appears that is the current state of the game. I never ran into it in vanilla through wotlk, but I suppose things change. I've just made a habit of clarifying loot rules before the run, or just not running group content unless absolutely necessary. It sucks, but it's all you can really do.
---
1 updoot to you.
---
I’m 5 weeks into raiding t1 2/8 with t2 helm and managed to get Rags shield last week. 
---
Can’t wait for the set bonus.
---
I play a druid so I tank a lot. I've not tanked 2 dungeons one with a worrior and one with a paly and I gotta say. Greatly prefer the paly
---
Why is that?
---
There is quite a lot of spots that i imagine will still be grindable for people to level as well, if people are willing to grind out xp that is.
---
I'd also like to point out that, at this time, we don't have any reason to believe Blizzard is going to release all of the phases at the same interval. Phase 2 is a baby update, with minimal amounts of content added. It makes sense that it would release faster than the other content phases which add much more content. Every phase after this will add at least one raid.
---
&gt;when he wants to do reserved runs
---
see heres your problem  
---
If you dont bring something to a group well beyond the average player, you dont deserve to reserve shit
---
Mythic+ is dungeons.
---
I'm not sure if it works, but sometimes cleaning the "Cache" folder works, can someone confirm?
---
Honestly, a lot of those BiS lists are not 100% accurate anyway. While things have been researched and guides have been written, there is still value in knowing how to optimize based on situation. 
---
So don't worry. Still wiggle room out there.
---
You can start at any point and catch up
---
I have found this one too! It’s on the way to darkspear trolls isn’t it...
---
Ok let’s set a few things straight:
---
1. Killing people below level 60 is just straight up sad. None of my friends, nor guildies do this because what’s the point? It’s not fun, and just makes someone else’s day worse. 
---
2. I did live inside dungeons from 52-60, I only went to capital cities twice at 54 and 58. The rest of what I did was purely instanced and didn’t allow the opposite faction to kill me. The only close calls I had was resetting the instance, and even then I could just run back in. 
---
3. If you want to play this game seriously and raid, you have to get your pre-BiS. Therefore, you HAVE to do these dungeons anyway. Why not do them and get some exp, and save the quests for max level when you get more gold (from experience to gold conversion) AND the quests are easier. I didn’t even finished my pre-raid BiS dungeon gear from 8 levels of pure dungeons, and I regret not starting at level 50, because then I’d have less dungeons to do for 0 reward at level 60. 
---
It seems like you guys are the ones who aren’t thinking about it logically. You act as if it is the worst possible gameplay ruining scenario, when it’s really not that bad. If you can’t handle a few deaths on your way to 60, then play a PvE server. I’ve heard they will be offering server transfers.

thanks for loading up the economy with easy gold and providing a few easy ganks while you were here.

In that case thank you for the advice to post in cringetopia where this video might do better. Have a blessed day.
---
I think shamans have some wonderful potential as a flavourful tank. In classic I think all they need is a shield empower to alleviate a bit of their squish (biggest issue is pushing crits off the table somehow really) aspect and a taunt. They'd be golden.
---
So anyway I started pulling
---
Most important stats for late game tank is + defense and fire resist(raiding) and for heals its +healing and mp5(spirit if u have incombat mana regen)
---
Neither are substantial in either so it doesnt matter too much
---
Are you fucking illiterate?

spy addon alerting him of nearby enemy faction
---
Beats being a smartass trying to one up everyone on every single thread like you.  You must be a pro theorycrafter.  I bow to your neckbeard, oh great one.
---
Start on your mount until you get to him, earthbind/Frost shock to slow. I don't know if freezing trap can be grounded but if it can, do that for the scatter when you get into melee. Otherwise Frost reflector/skull is the next option.
---
Felwood isn't out of the way, and pvp will definitely be happening there
---
For the horde!
---
&gt;Warriors need to learn how to put on a shield until raids so everyone else can get gear.
---
&gt;Other people need to play a role they don't find fun for my benefit
---
Yeah how about no.
---
Well yeah we do wait.
---
Reserving “first orb” versus “holy shit big fucking epic mount” are two different things, for your comprehension.
---
In any case, judging by the reaction of the LFG chat+here, it seems you are in the minority. Which is fine since we need diversity of opinions, even when they make zero sense for intelligent people.
---
https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table#weapon-skill
---
I'm sorry I don't mean the content of the chats. I mean like it forgets extra channels like /lfg and /world. Also I have to re add all the standard channels. It's kinda annoying and I've never heard anyone else mention it
---
Skullflame seems fine to me
---
Congrats fellas!!
---
Thanks this helps but itll be pretty hard to find anyone to do it when I'm on. Also do you know which of those chest pieces is better?
---
&gt; Lol what? There is an over abundance of players for guilds right now.
---
Your guild is irrelevant. You've been assuming this whole time that the majority of people are in zerg guilds and are tryharding so much that memespecs are strictly outlawed.
---
It's just not the case. Most people don't care. And even for many that do, many don't need to - there's always things you can improve on over quibbling about specs that are probably providing beneficial utility you're ignoring
---
&gt; it seems you have real mental issues and should seek help.
---
Lmao, that's the strategy of a teenager. Backtracking, playing a victim, and 
---
"u can' reed lol" and "ur crazy lol sek halp"
---
A boring method of deflection. Guess I can't blame ya when you can't defend the insane generalization that every guild cares about memespecs.
---
The 10% that love Classic play Classic. The other 10% that love TBC play TBC. Etc, etc. Then you'll also have people who seasonally play and pop in depending on the "season" they're playing through with their guild. Those communities are still large enough to game with.
---
Classic exit strategy.

I went and took screenshots from the old SD quality video, put them through a Machine Learning Upscaler, then just applied some filters and brushed them a bit to give them a darker tone.

So again, what do you want to happen?
---
Is it surprising that guilds want you to be the best you can be? 
---
Seriously - What is your ideal wow?
---
&gt;This tunnel vision completely fails to take into account player skill or experience.
---
Generally I'd assume well skilled and experienced players would like to be as effective as they can be, right?
---
Honor should have been in at launch
---
I said if you don't show up in spec while everyone else is then you're being selfish. If it's not expected of the raid then it's up to you. But the norm is that it is expected. 
---
You saying you can do well without it is not relevant to my point. So no I don't care, sorry.
---
This, maybe. https://discord.gg/xkhEM3
---
443 DPS with WF is what I borderline consider autoattacking
---
My main is a Druid tank and I've got a Pally tank that I'm leveling right now (44atm). I've actually come to greatly prefer playing Pally tank despite Druid being my main through all of Vanilla, BC, and Wrath until I quit.
---
I never have aggro issues. Using mana instead of Rage is unbelievably nice and I have all the AoE I could ever need.
---
As title say, i know combat is the one i should do but i'm wondering, is the only way to go?
---
Why not Subtlety or Assa? Assa i know it's more for lvl 60 or so, Sub tho i don't know enough.
---
As for professions? In my guild they said DE + Mining, why? I mean, i can do DE with a lvl 5 Alt, isn't it wasted on a class i want to lvl up? Mining i'll do for sure since it's a good income of money and i plan to do Engi at 60, still the other profession which should be? mining and?
---
Thank you for the answers :3
---
Yeah but it's scaled to raid levels.....
---
Laughs in SM/Ruin
---
It's selfish that you won't change to benefit the 39 other people, it's not selfish not that the 39 other people want you to be optimal.
---
I know this is basically close to unanswerable, but what faction/class should I play? I have actually been playing since a week or two after classic came out, so I have a few months in and I am still second guessing my choices. I am enjoying myself usually, but just unsure of my character/faction choices. I have a level 50 troll priest and a 30 orc warrior (I was going to go ally but my friends were horde, I think this is the heart of the issue). I also have a handful of alliance alts ranging from 5-16. Nothing has really stuck out to me yet. I have enjoyed the warrior the most so far.
---
 I used to roll a gnome mage and a NE rogue in vanilla/BC ( along with some alts, played a lot but did very little end game content). I thought maybe I just needed a faction change, but when I play my Alliance characters it just feels empty. Maybe because I dont know anyone on those servers yet?
---
I guess in terms of what I want, I definitely want to do end game raids, but am also interested in pvp. I always like to play the under dog, not sure what that is on the servers I am on. I am more partial to alliance I guess, but I a playing horde characters right now because that is the server/faction my friends played on (I think they stopped)
---
Sorry for the jumbled post, I do not post often. TLDR: I have been playing for 2 months and still dont know what I want to main. I used to play alliance, I am playing horde now because that is what my friends went and I think they quit. What do you recommend? Mage seems overy popular now, but it was my original class. Idk, not expecting much from this, just cant figure it out so figured I would get input. Also, I do feel kind of obligated to my horde characters due to the time invested, but would be willing to start over if I discovered what I want
---
Major premade groups collude, within the faction.
---
The ones who wintrade with the opposing premades should be banned.
---
Why would he tho?.. he can find another dps in seconds, why would he bring extra loot competition
---
is this a guild ad?
---
Skeram?
---
same reason people cheat in games, id imagine, to get ahead of others without any effort
---
When no other option exists ; kill his pet. 
---
Debuffs them to unhappy and they lose their 125% pet damage benefit, and if it stays unhappy long enough itll run away.
---
They're low prio compared to the tank or healing whoever's getting wailed on, though.
---
And there's the case closed. Your only distinction is the faction. Which Blizzard hasn't cared to care about in 10+ years. Cross-faction collusion is just as allowable as same-faction collusion.
---
I'm honestly surprised i dont see people asking for boosts more often. Did they not really take off until TBC? Because i started in TBC and i strongly remember trade being spammed at all times by people wanting boosts. dungeon finder took care of that for better and for worse
---
The staff has an activated ability where it will switch between the two forms. Kinda like Vendorstrike.
---
Those are awesome!  Can I ask where you got them?
---
fury warriors arent rolling against him for gear, he just outright refuses to allow them in a group.
---
No one complained about private servers feeling inauthentic?? HHAHAHAH
---
Yeah for sure, I wasn't accusing you of sucking. Just saying there are definitely people who can play for many years and just never be good haha.
---
Ten Storms feels fine. Though, I'm only level 30.
---
Leveling in dungeons in only good if you have a good group. If you have to find one every time, its not worth it. Just keep doing quest/grinding and try to not have downtime. Try to avoid stupid quest that get you going around the globe.
---
Talk with your guild, most are content with the standard ele/resto hybrid build
---
no the unspoken rule is you jump off the ship about 10 seconds before it docks
---
&gt; No WAY am I playing a healer.
---
Healing is great because most of the time if somebody dies it's their fault. A smooth pull has me wanding more than healing because the tank's got the aggro and the Mage hasn't decided to tank by using their Frost Nova, Cone of Cold combo at the start of a pull.
---
It’ll be awesome. There’s a ton of English realms still layered too.
---
It’ll be all out war, for a couple weeks until Battlegrounds release. Just enjoy it!
---
Depends, he didn't specify in his question if he's now a dedicated raid prot tank, or just tanking 5 mans. Even then many guilds will only take a single dedicated prot tank since the other warriors are more valuable as DPS when their not in an OT role, which they can often fill as non-prot at reasonable gear levels.
---
If by way more you mean marginally more then yes.
---
I don't have all the information so I don't know.  I just have a hard time believing that the jumps are as long range as Chain Heal and given Healing Wave only has a 13% greater spellpower coefficient the fact that the jumps are being reduced by 80% per jump (as opposed to 50% for Chain Heal which is further buffed by the 3 piece tier 2 bonus) should mean the latter has far greater HPS even if maybe it ends up being less hp/m with the tier 1 5 piece being factored.  And again, not to mention the generally superior stats on the tier 2 set even from a purely healing perspective.  My initial take on looking at the tier 1 set bonuses was that they made you a better tank healer but were largely irrelevant because you're still a worse tank healer and far better raid healer than priests.  The 5 piece is nice because you're still using Healing Wave to raid heal on fights where the raid is spread out too much for Chain Heal to be effective (Rag, Ony) but otherwise it seemed like a set that either made you better at a job you were still suboptimal for or made you an absolute dungeon healing monster, but by the time you have that level of gear dungeons are already utterly trivial.
---
I don't have the full set to test everything though so I don't have the math done.
---
&gt; So again, what do you want to happen?
---
I want the community to value an experienced skilled player who has an Item Set that is 98% as good as the BiS Item Set MORE THAN an inexperienced unskilled player with 100% of their BiS Item Set.
---
Spammers can change their methods infinitely faster than Blizzard changes the filter.
---
Thanks for insulting me though, reported :)
---
Read your post, you said r14 horde mage, r13 nelf druid, seperate server. Go read what you said. 
---
Ty for telling me the server name Drak'Thul, an easy search shows that this is a server that was released during 2006 jan, just a year before tbc and you can see that the servers history begins with guild progression for tbc content and it is not one of the original eu servers. Back then it took pretty long for people to get lvl 60, so I doubt you did all this in 6 months during the old system while learning the game and ranking on a seperate faction. Anyways ty for exposing yourself, the server has no collected history of R14 during vanilla until the pre patch where it made it extremely easy for anyone to get ranks for the upcomimg expansion.
---
I agree but you can just avoid that stuff. I mean obviously that wont stop others from doing it but if people give you shit for not doing it , they are the asshole and not you.
---
Pretty much. If you rolled on a pvp realm and you aren't at least 55 (when you can start doing BRD/maybe lbrs as a hunter) farm you're gonna just be farmed 24/7 for honor.
---
on retail they know their bis before the patch even laucnhes because wowhead posts everything. kinda dont like that but what can you do
---
Warrior tank here, first time tanking classic/vanilla dungeons too and it's easy as piss. Before most runs I'll even say "hey guys not familiar with the dungeon" and everyone's okay with it because who wants to spend another half hour finding another tank? You're the king of the group. Nobody dares piss you off for fear of the whole party disbanding.
---
I don't know what's all this about having to be the most experienced player in the group because 90% of the time that's not me when I'm tanking and someone else who is more experienced will explain things, etc. So what if I pull a few extra mobs instead of taking some shortcut? Never had anyone complain about that either just kindly point it out so I know what to do next time.
---
Something tells me all these people who've had these horrible experiences as tank that the problem maybe lies with their attitude because I've been levelling almost exclusively through tanking and haven't had any issues.
---
Might as well email them your ELUA and get signed waiver forms before starting the run, you'll find groups real quick!
---
maybe people just finally realized what the master race is and they arent doing it for racial abilities
---
I switched from shadow to holy/disc at 60 and tried to some some leftover quests, it was much worse.
---
Yep. I know personally a few people who have said if the ganking gets worse as they level they wont "Git gud just pvp" they'll just quit.
---
And I get the feeling they arent the minority in that stance.
---
Would that channel die the moment I logged out? Not sure how user channels function in that regard.
---
430 threat ... spread across each mob. Not 430 to each mob. Spamming demo shout will not hold threat off a healer any more, even with 10 mobs. I have literally tried it.
---
I thought it was suppose to be a ribcage
---
You can set a chat filter with Prat (haven't done it but heard you can)
---
As soon as there are more then one target warriors falls really flat.
---
A prot paladin tanking does huge dmg.. It is really huge.
---
So yeah Single target the warrior is the best.
---
AoE? Well.. Good luck :)
---
Never happened to me in vanilla
---
LOL
---
what the fuck did you expect
---
If you want PvE, Nethergarde Keep.
---
It would go to the next person whose been in there the longest.
---
Great heavy soul arrow
---
you be playin with some trash warrs bruh
---
I don’t think anyone expected classic dungeons and raiding to be harder than retail.. it was very well known that classic raiding is easy
---
Blah blah blah 
---
“I’ve blah blah ...my blah blah...”
---
Whatever.  15 yrs of literally millions of players across the globe micro analyzing specs and suddenly you just happen to know better, right?
---
Wtf.  Seriously dude.  Go be bad in silence.
---
Several hours of wait time for a WSG really, really sucked though.
---
ppl tried getting it going, just doesnt work. Some people want to look for groups on their alt AND their main anyway. 
---
/lfg went down in activity.
---
If the text scrolling is a bother just put lookingforgroup in a new tab and only check when you are activly searching
---
It does show if you are a good healer or if you are a healer who tops the meter pumping consumables.
---
Hunters if you’re bad and Warlocks if you’re not then? What if you’re good and you play Hunter?!
---
That isn't what I said.....
---
OK put it this way; You have been playing together with Bob, Jim and Larry for months.
---
Bob and Jim have their full BiS Item Set. Larry doesn't any any BiS item but the Items they do have are 98% as good as BiS.
---
You invite Bob and Jim to the party when 2 other people who you have never played with but have their BiS Item Set ask to join.
---
Do you sideline Larry just because he has been unlucky with drops?
---
Your lockout starts when you leave the group or reset the instance. So your 2.52 doesn’t matter; what matters is what time you left that instance.
---
Just because its "fine" doesn't mean you are a good healer.
---
Herbalism will always sell and will always be useful if you raid. I just got mine up to 300 after I got my epic mount and I’m glad I did.
---
For what it's worth, my last MC parse there was 1 healer who did less overhealing than me, and they were way down on the heals.  I'd have to double check, but I think they were a disc priest.  Shaman doesn't overheal as much as other classes, because chain heal is a smart heal.  But everyone is making up stories to pretend they're right here, instead of actually evaluating the comment chain.  I mean honestly, why are people so confident about this arbitrary speculation?  People just like having an excuse to be bitter and toxic for no reason I guess.
---
I’m assuming this is during leveling, when everyone is AoE spamming?  Our warlocks are quite competitive with mages in MC as long as the fight isn’t an AoE fest.
---
If you credit the mage’s increased damage from curses to the warlock casting it, warlocks absolutely demolish mages in damage they bring to the raid.
---
Nelf animations beat every class what are you talking about?
---
Yeah, it's showing that it's effectively doubling his mana generation from when he's popping pots and runes on cooldown for free.
---
People who reserve loot in pugs are idiots
---
sadly this spec only works for one faction, and only for the other faction in raids on some bosses, with some shamans.
---
As someone that’s made ~50k gold from soloing ubrs/lbrs with 8 warriors and 2 shamans, nope, not cheating.
---
Noticed cause your the only priest not in the Raid lmao
---
Honestly, yeah has a Horde player who hasn't had much trouble with the alliance lvling, normally go out of my way to help them, since I remember being the outnumber faction in the vanilla days as Horde...
---
The 50-60 bit has been a bloodbath and these alliance players fight with such cold zeal, I mean they kill me on sight for just existing.
---
Rolling in to Kargath like it was nothing.
---
I am heartened that Alliance has some fight on Herod but am actually scared every time I log in now.
---
No you can’t do this. The reason you can’t is because blizzard want players to make the right decisions at the right times not have a button that just has pre made actions. 
---
Otherwise for example, as a paladin I could make all my spells macro with a conditional that if I go to 10% health I will bubble. 
---
You can’t make any conditional macros that are based on health, mana, energy etc. The only ones I know you can do are stances, stealth and combat
---
It’s stupid but I guess this is just how shit works nowadays. Same fucking thing happened to me earlier for the truefaith pattern when a mage need rolled and won for his priest alt.
---
 I think professions are a little more of a gray area than class items.
---
Dripping swag like a broken faucet.
---
The thing is... if they're wearing "full leather" that means they took the time to farm all those specific good leather pieces instead of just wearing whatever. So maybe they also took time to grind and enchant pvp gear, at least to a reasonable level?
---
Those same people are on reddit asking what is the very best and most optimal spec/ way to play.
---
I wish people would chill with the 
---
“you play the game differently than me, you should go back to retail. I disagree with you so you should probably go back to retail. Your suggestion sucks. Go back to retail. You killed me in wpvp? Go back to retail. Arguing in trade chat? Go back to retail. Downvoted on Reddit? Go back to retail. Late to work? Go back to retail. Lost your wallet? Go back to retail. Wife cheated on you? Go back to retail. Forgot an item at Target? Go back to retail.” 
---
The game is fun in different ways for different people. Most of the game isn’t challenging skill wise. It’s just time consuming and grindy.
---
Sub for PvP the the others are subject to opinion
---
Nice thank you! Just hit 51 and won’t be able to play this week so definitely planning on farming some pre-bis while the big pvp wave is happening.
---
Ok?
---
Have done all of those things. The very first heal that is cast will pull aggro on any mob you haven't auto'd sundered. 
---
It doesn't work in reality, and you saying it does leads people to make bad tanking choices.
---
Nice, I even show up on damage meters as boomkin now.
---
"98% as good"
---
Lmao. So Larry is in full BiS minus one piece is what your saying.  
---
No one is being benched in M fucking C because they are missing a few pieces of BiS. Literally no one. 
---
You're making a huge hissy fit about something that just doesn't happen.
---
Youre either a troll or incredily salty.
---
Just read what the person above wrote. They dont want to "world pvp" because its not a challenging/competetive environment at all. Thats like going into counterstrike with an aimbot and pressing left mouse for a few hours. Thats not engaging interaction. People play CS because there is a fair match with equal teams and people actually trying. This is also what people want out of BGs. A competetive (however competetive classic pvp can be) environment for PvP. The idea of a fair match where you can outplay (or in the case of WoW: outgear) other players is what keeps people coming back. And of course the fact that there is a reward/ranking system behind it helps. But i fail to see how that is a bad thing.
---
People love that stuff and its what keeps competetive/pvp games alive. People wouldnt still be playing chess if chess consisted mostly of random hustlers getting all in your face with a chessboard on a train, or if just slamming your hand on the board was a legal chess move. People who are into chess look for other people that are into chess and want to play vs them. Chess uses a frigging worldwide elo rating...
---
What happens if you dont leave a group (or are the leader) and run different instances?  When does the timer start if you dont reset anything?
---
Here's some testing I did, which seems to support what you say (at least in the case of resetting one single dungeon)
---
https://i.imgur.com/DmJ8Nej.png
---
I had afk'ed a bit after the 5th reset and rezone punted me to my hearth, but then I was able to reset at 4.17 twice and both of those became available at 5.18, after #7 though each of them are as close to possible as being accessible.  Probably if I had reset at 4.03 instead of 3.55 I would have been able to stay in.  Though that means 12 min runs are a myth.
---
It is okay. In fact it is better in a lot of cases, especially while leveling.
---
We already are past #nochanges with the interface options converting to modern wow
---
hundreds of thousands of people are admiring a bodybuilder that helped them get out of the rut in their life.
---
it’s super sad to talk shit about someone because they used roids when all competitive bodybuilders today do, and left a hugely positive impact, who on top of that is dead and has a grieving sibling and parents. pathetic.
---
I have to admit I enjoy stealthing close to greys on my rogue to freak them out. And sometimes I sap them when they are sitting to drink just to be annoying as a rogue should do. But killing greys feels wrong unless they attack me when i am clearly ignoring them. Then I kill them because they are an idiot.
---
As someone who did play 15 years ago, nobody even ran BRD at all because people just assumed there was no good pre-raid gear there. The fact you want to run BRD at 60 shows you are playing to min-max just as much.
---
All reservers are bad for the game we all pay for, reserving is for scums
---
Do you need on every boe that drops? Like a random green cloak?
---
Made fun of for playing the highest DPS class in classic? Okay.
---
Yeah a lot of the fun was learning new shit and the rewards for figuring shit out first were immense and meaningful. Sadly, those days are over for Classic and, in a some ways, they are over for all games as Twitch/YouTube spew information freely to the masses. That and people learned how to learn/how to minmax so any new games are figured out much more quickly. RIP our childhoods PepeHands.

Any advice for the start of phase 2 of Ragnaros? We usually lose too many people.
---
Like your opinion is any more useful?
---
Slow internet?
---
Absolutely wrong. If the lock doesn't have the nightfall talent they shouldn't be using corruption in most raids.
---
For those that want something super simple, open `Details\core\gears.lua` and do the following:
---
    -- find the following line
---
    tinsert (talentsSelected, {iconTexture, rank, tier, column, i, specID, maxRank})
---
    -- change rank to 0
---
    tinsert (talentsSelected, {iconTexture, 0, tier, column, i, specID, maxRank})
---
When anyone with Details inspects you, their talent window will show nothing, it won't even load any backgrounds or talents.

World of Warcraft Classic....
---
Hmmmmmmm
---
As far as I can tell, [warlocks are doing pretty well](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/YTtZancg27Kwzydq#fight=last&amp;type=damage-done).
---
Also keep in mind that 10% of every mage's damage can be attributed to the CoE warlock.  Much of the melee damage can be attributed to the CoR warlock, etc.
---
Unspent mana is unused healing.  A good healers goal is to end the fight oom.  It's quite ironic that the people making up stories to say people are bad healers don't seem to know anything about raid healing themselves.
---
And you're absolutely right about the competitive nature.  The ideal scenario is that you have healers competing on the meters, creating enough healing, that you can drop one and add a dps to decrease clear times.  Hell, why not make everyone happy?  There's probably at least 1 hybrid who would prefer to dps than heal in almost every raid.  Let them do it, so you have the healer in reserve when you need them again.  
---
I don't know why everyone is obsessed with min/maxing, whichever side of the argument they're on.  That's not the important part.  The important part is having a group of people that cooperate holistically.
---
In terms of leeway/batching? You won’t find a single person in the history of mankind.
---
Nice.
---
It takes practice. I used to die once every 2 runs and I would lose my mind at these stupid zombies resisting everything. I've gotten good enough that I can reliably clear in 10 minutes from entrance to exit in a poorly optimized spec. A few notes I have learned:
---
1. Improved blizzard can end up fucking you. If you have a pack of mobs with the 75% slow, using cone of cold on them won't apply the slow since there is already a higher slow % active on the target, so always frost nova to wait out the blizzard slow duration. If you are like me and prefer just kiting them with cone of cold, only use 1/3 imp blizzard and put the rest of the points into piercing ice.
---
2. After your nova, if you are fortunate enough that none of them resist, you can either go back for more blizzards (boring!) or set up a flamestrike+coc combo when the mobs have a little bit more than 3 seconds left on their root (prevents early breaks).
---
3. If you get a few nova resists, let them get slowed from your ice armor and try to maneuver them so they will get coc'd with the rest of the group. I like to blink through the group so that they will be on top of the main group when I have another cone of cold. It's expensive on mana but once you get properly geared you can start taking more risks. I have 3200 hp/6700 mana in my aoe set and I feel a lot tankier than when I was at 2500hp/6000 mana. 
---
4. If you are running low on mana, use either R1 AE (lowest cost) or R2 AE (my preference, scales with spell power a lot better than r1) to fish for clearcasts that you can use a max rank AE or cone of cold to maximize your mana efficiency.
---
5. Whenever you are AE'ing the group, always take a step towards them and cast it so it has the leeway to reach the mobs in the back. The golden rule is to always be moving when you are spamming AE.
---
6. If you have a good network connection, you can get a tighter clump of adds by moving towards the group just close enough that the mobs in front stop (they usually hit you, but it should only be a few) then immediately run normally, the mobs in the back will still be moving so it will become tighter. 
---
I've farmed 1500 gold from ZF after trying DM:E runs for a while. I have never got a world epic drop but I have got 2 cassandra's grace, which is the most valuable world rare you can get from ZF.
---
Goodluck farming rich thorium these days. Tailoring can make you via mooncloth CD, mooncloth bags, runecloth bags, common items felcloth patterns etc. I’m tailor/mining, and mining is way harder without layering now
---
Sorry but it is true. It’s been tested for years on private servers. Paladins aren’t favourites in PvP but yes we can beat hunters. The reason? Cleanse is cheaper than their stings and that’s it. They’ll oom before we do and then they’ll be stuck.
---
Or. You could just put the Spell "Dismiss pet" on your action bar. And never have this
---
Yeah, anyone gauging by overhealing bad instead of effective healing good is not someone I want to raid with.
---
Gaslighting the Horde is definitely an interesting technique.
---
Any warriors out there know a good simplistic addon for overpower proc notification.
---
What you are forgetting is that healing wave gains 100% of bonus healing due to being a 3 sec base cast time (2.5 with talents) and the fact that t1 actually has more plus healing than t2 does. T2 as a resto set is actually garbage. 
---
With these two factors, you will have more HPS using healing wave than chain heal. And yes, the jump radiance is about the same
---
No pita bread is actually quite good
---
I ran LBRS the other day with a Shaman tanking and it was probably the smoothest run through there I've done for a while.
---
Just seems to be something about hybrid classes that 'can tank, but not primarily designed for it' that makes the people that play them in that off spec so much more aware of what they're doing...
---
Yeah Felwood has been worse then Ungoro for me for questing and that's before PvP comes out can only imagine what a nightmare it will be in a few weeks.
---
I would rather have long ques and play on Arugal with the thriving community and activity then be on an underpopulated server.

If not, reset the instance.
---
God forbid animals do animal things
---
Yeah.  Sure son.
---
ye, seal of command scales with topend damage
---
You do, but it comes back to how much is your time worth? Is it worth another 20 mins to find a tank that’s “normal”?
---
Most of the hunters pets I see in the open world are chinese symbols, bots..
---
Congratulations from your sister server Arugal!
---
Nice one mate
---
I know people complain a lot about any catch-up mechanic, but I think the badge system was great in TBC. Yea, it let you buy some T6-equivalent gear by just running dungeons. But it took you like 3 weeks of farming for a single item. Casual players were working towards their catch-up, not being spoon fed Artifact Knowledge, World Quests, etc. I can't stand retail catch-ups but I just hate it when people say TBC sucks because it was the beginning of catch-up mechanics.
---
You want to be specced into imp zerker rage so you can pop it then intercept when you get punted.
---
Literally my point - I can ignore one person who keeps advertising a run I don't want to see, ignoring the dozens whining about it? Not so easy. If those people just clicked "ignore" then that's problem solved.
---
Sure, if by "specific end game situations" you mean when they're level 60 with pre-raid BIS. Because that's when they beat everyone until the end of classic. So, before raids even come into play.
---
There are quite a few items that are pre-raid bis for both dps and tank: Brigam's Girdle, Elven Ring, etc. But it sounds like he was just doing it out of spite :D
---
Yeah but I’d be leveling in retail ew
---
I have yet to run into a pala or druid (or priest) that refused to heal or tank.  The only clas that regularly does is warrior.
---
Says the DPS who rolled DPS because they don't want to tank
---
&gt;You make some good points but never mention the mana benefit of t8.
---
You mean tier 1?  I did mention it, but Healing Wave is already more efficient than Chain Heal so being more... *more* efficient is kind of irrelevant when you use Chain Heal for the HPS in any case.  And remember the original commenter to whom I responded said you'd use 8/8 tier 1 until 5 and 3 set tier 2.5 and 2, not just until 3 and then 5 set tier 2.
---
I don't know how relevant the Bloodvine set is to spriests but all the mages and warlocks in my guild are keeping tailoring entirely because of that. It's got 4% hit combined and a set bonus of some crit, but you need 300 tailoring to use the set bonus.
---
Yeah I've been running away from mobs, popped it and it didn't do jack shit. Most of the time it works. 
---
Most times I pop vanish and a mob hits me after I'm stealthed and it doesn't break vanish, which I feel like it should, but glad it doesnt.
---
Don't be entitled. Eat or drink or both. Don't expect to lifetap and make the healer use Mana to top you off every time.  If everyone else is eating /drinking, you don't have an excuse not to do the same if you don't have enough hours/Mana.
---
Ive been topping the charts on my lock in all content since I hit 60. They are insane right now, and I finally learned just how shitty all of the other locks ive played with really were. Eye opening experience.
---
Why do people think anyone gives a shit about Dwarves in raids?
---
MC is faceroll level easy. The only reason to roll Dwarf is if you want an edge in PVP. Otherwise they're ugly as sin, have bad animations and their PVE worth is vastly overstated.
---
You can try leveling an alliance character on a different realm to see if you like it. If you don’t have any friends to play with or a guild to join then a large pop server will make you feel very lonely. I would recommend rolling an alliance or horde character on a small role play realm to get a nice sense of community. You might not even come back
---
You're welcome!😃
---
It would be like the super secret tank channel where all the tanks hang out and collaborate on who gets a tank for their dungeon
---
The intended role for their class? Well let's see, they're the highest DPS in the game, and the majority of warriors in a raid will be DPS. So?
---
Then he isn't 98%. He's like 60% as strong, and he still wont be benched because MC groups need bodies. 
---
If he joined a stupidly elite guild that does regular 'gear checks' to determine if he gets to go into the easiest raid in WoW history Larry can't blame anyone but himself.
---
So for an alliance to tame Echeyakee, you pretty much have to collude with horde to make them summon him right?
---
He’s likely under the impression it’s #NoChanges. Guy is like the crying Star Wars kid when it comes to Blizzard.
---
There's a difference between turbo maximizing your raid performance, sacrificing anything and everything to squeeze out every last percentage of optimization out of your character for PvE purposes, and what is *actually* necessary.
---
We get it, you have a boyfriend.
---
Will have to watch these again they are brilliant.

---
Need to set your phase to 1.5 (Dire Maul)
---
You have to sit and drink after each pull, your DPS is shit with time to clear an instance taken into consideration, and no you don't outdps a decent warrior either. They'll beat anyone on single-target and 3-5 cleave.  After that mages are better, but it's not really relevant 99% of the time.
---
And it was awful. Queue times were 1-2 hours or more, for some realms.
---
Classic is based off of 1.12, so BGs should be cross-realm.
---
Imagine being this bothered by other people having fun their own way.
---
As a lvl 37 boosting a lvl 20, the xp seems pretty bad from killing mobs and travel time is such a significant part of questing. What method did you use?
---
Embrace the chaos, bathe in the blood of you're enemies. 
---
I'm RPing that a peace treaty was in place in phase 1 and now it's full blown war. If they want war, I'll give them war.
---
Nope, warrior still beats a a prot paladin, this dude is just in denial.
---
What are you ON about you clown? What is *easy* about not having dishonorable kills? If anything, it's rather EASY for the people who don't have their civilians killed that there ARE dishonorable kills.
---
I am talking about fun, yeah? It can be challenging to raid Orgrimmar or Stormwind. Now, it's not even a possibility anymore.
---
I NEED THIS
---
Warriors dominate DPS in all dungeons but the hardest AoE situations from RFC to 60.
---
Can always tell which of the people dont join their class discord. Theres a literal video guide there.
---
Updooted?
---
https://i.imgur.com/ESiYZCQ.gif
---
I've literally never seen it and I've been in more than one group that wiped to the point of going red and having to disband. And this isn't just RFD either I've run every dungeon at least 5 times (except Alliance ones i.e. Gnomer, Stocks, VC) all the way up to BRD. It's like we're playing two different games.
---
Not to sound prejudiced but I've heard NA servers have a pretty big problem with streamers and toxic Twitch culture. Oceanic servers tend to be quite relaxed. Literally only ever come across 1 dickhead who was a Warlock who kept life tapping to almost no HP, pulling with huge AoE and then blaming the healer when dying. The healer refused to heal him the rest of the dungeon and every time he died he had to corpse run back. The rest of the party thought it was hilarious. Apart from that, everyone else has been pretty cool in the many instances I've run.
---
Gj guys...have you downed onyxia too?
---
Oh they absolutely. A bad tank = death. You can carry a bad DPS but not so much a tank. But mechanically tanking well and DPSing well (probably healing well as well I don't know as I don't really heal) are about on par.
---
If you rolled a spec that can't tank or heal, or you rolled one and you don't do it, you're just a whiny bitch.
---
Or full Dura rank 1 😂
---
Thank you!
---
What kind of handicapped guild do you play in that you can't life tap in MC lol?
---
I do the same. Any time I see a group I want, I click the name and check the class. If it’s warrior I won’t even bother. Like I go between MS and fury every week and I tank dungeons well as both.
---
Sorry you may have to pause Netflix for this run buddy. Sucks
---
I mean, grats on being the definition of toxic I guess... right down to assuming everyone is the same as you.
---
BWL is easy as hell cause half of the fights are about buggy positioning.
---
Use a target macro also
---
it's just not very interesting
---
depends on your gear/gear level.  Preraid BIS tank gear (or even just lvl 60 plate)?  Sure. 
---
DPS leather / mail?  No... please god no more "tanks" running devilsaur.
---
Take it easy, man. Not every guild has been raiding since week one. My guild is pretty laid back, as most of us have full-time jobs and kids. We all progress at our own rate.
---
In my guild's current situation, I get a DPS benefit from damage mitigation. If we were all phase 1 BiS geared, hardcore raiders and spending 50g on consumables per night, I would be better off DS/Ruin.
---
The mix of pugs wanting to do quests, caster mobs, and ease of fucking up a tribute run just makes me not want to tank it outside of guild runs
---
Arguably they're pretty on par in PvP. Dwarf is obviously better in the fight itself, but Night Elf has shadowmeld which can do some *very* nasty things with a little set up.
---
Most female characters are guys, I'm sure you are aware of that right.
---
Especially if they have a ravager.
---
A lot of warriors don't carry shields or even plate gear.
---
If your just doing instant shadowbolt +10% shadow damage then your either running sm/ruin not true affliction or your doing less damage for no benefit.
---
What possible benefit is there to doing curse+corruption shadowbolt spam and not taking ruin? Dark pact is garbage and there's nothing worth taking in the affliction tree that you don't already have with a sm/ruin build. You could get better curse of exhaustion, better drain Mana, better curse of weakness, better drain life, none of that is useful in anyway for raiding.
---
It was just double-check if your name really checked out.
---
I just wanted make sure no one else takes your shitty opinions seriously. fuck off cunt.
---
There's a trap right next to an ore spawn in northern desolace
---
Imagine actually linking logs to an obvious troll post jeez
---
&gt; Then he isn't 98%. He's like 60% as strong, and he still wont be benched because MC groups need bodies.
---
&gt;
---
&gt; If he joined a stupidly elite guild that does regular 'gear checks' to determine if he gets to go into the easiest raid in WoW history Larry can't blame anyone but himself.

You make my point perfectly ;)
---
People hide tslents from people like you because they want to enjoy their game without having dicks like you yelling at them 24/7.
---
Represent!
---
Small world
---
I particularly enjoy the leveling aspect of the game. In vanilla wow I had a 60 of every class. I was an altoholic and am not shameful of it. I had a couple of t2 and AQ geared characters but the most fun aspect of the game for me was leveling for whatever reason. Maybe because people are there to try and have fun while leveling instead of mindless grinding the same dungeon for 2 weeks trying to get a single item. I'm not sure why but I suppose it's because everyone takes away something different from different parts of the game.
---
Yo how do i find out whats the ratio on my server im flamelash-eu
---
Yea ur right. But undead don’t do flips!
---
Doubt.
---
Imagine screwing 39 other people over because “ it’s fun”
---
&gt; Are people overblowing the “insanity” that will be world PvP next week?
---
No, they don't. Go to STV right now - it's a massacre. You can't quest alone, because you will be killed by roaming parties.  
---
And if you gather in party and try to quest, other side will wait until you pull and attack in the back. Just had 3 hours of this, that ended with two level 60 coming and killing everybody.
---
Of course you can't tank in leather. Tanking with a two-hander in arms/pvp spec is not the same as a fury warrior trying to tank. The latter is not viable at all while the former is actually better in most cases than prot for dungeons, since the increase in damage is more effective than the defense you lose
---
I know, which is why I refuse to look for people if they want to reserve stuff lol
---
Warriors would like a word...
---
Yeah as a rogue fury warriors aren't allowed in any 5 man I do.
---
I honestly believe, even if it's not me in the situation as it often isn't on my alts, that it's not selfish to not want to tank. Especially when fury warriors are the #1 DPS in the game.
---
Some people just don't want that level of responsibility, in which case would not be the kind of person I want as a tank.
---
For the record, I do tank on my warrior but there are definitely days where I'm more tired, or had a few drinks where I don't think I'm going to give it the attention I need. To call people warriors who don't tank "selfish" is incredibly shortsighted and inherintly selfish in its own right.
---
And don't act like if one of these DPS warriors did go tank you wouldn't complain if they weren't good, because I know damn well most people here do.
---
For what its worth, wowhead guides are off on a lot of pieces.
---
But yeah, the game is 14 years old.  What do you expect?
---
To be bad or not bad.  That is the question. 
---
You choose poorly.
---
How do you know someone is experienced? An experienced player should know what the best armor for their class is. The fact they were dedicated enough to wear only the top best shows that they are experienced and dedicated far more than someone who just takes whatever they can get, no?
---
I can post a video the next time I do north because it works well enough for me to pull the 3 packs of nonelites in North along the right corridor of a tribute run and have my lock / mage hellfire and blizzard without losing any agro.
---
Though I’ll concede Engineering is the best in that department, this method works well enough in any nonelite pull.
---
This is Zandalari Tribe EU. I'm the Dwarfpriest in question.
---
Done in by spell batching once again.
---
My point is the vast majority of realms that look like this aren't still layered.
---
Arugal is, and when phase 2 comes in less than two weeks and gets rid of layers, Arugal is gonna feel very *full*.
---
He never said they were obligated to help him, but in an MMO it’s usually a common thing to helps out others in the same zone with harder or elite mobs.
---
With that being said, if you don’t get help from others, I wouldn’t advise berating them in chat because they simply didn’t rush to your aid.
---
I am Alliance rogue also new to Wow I feel your pain it really sucks when LFG messages are full of "lfm ranged dps only".
---
It feels like rogue really got shaft compared to mages for levelling and doing quests.
---
There are heaps of quests in Tanaris around your level but I struggled because got ganked a lot in this zone. I went to hinterlands and just grinded mobs for a few levels. I just did a loop killing all the wolves I came across it sucks but felt like only real option I had. Once you get to about level 48 you can do maradon (if you can get a group) and get thrash blade it's a quest reward for alliance not sure about horde. It gives you a real power spike. 
---
From level 50 I ran Sunken temple as well and started grinding mobs in fellwood, the bears and wolves. Then once 52 it got a lot easier heaps of quests in Ungoro crater burning steppes etc and you can start doing BRD. It speeds up a lot in mid 50's if you can stick it out. The further through the game you get more willing people are to let rogues into their dungeon groups.
---
So, im playing a holy priest. I really enjoy healing PvE and i'd never spec shadow for raids (and also that slot is already filled in the guild).   
---
But for PvP I really wanna go shadow, but firstly I dont wanna have those 100g a week respec costs and also I feel like getting gear as shadow would be hard since I cant bid on shadow items in raids. But maybe there arent so many items from raids that counts towards PvP anyway?
---
I guess my questions are, is healing in bgs any fun? Can disc with the right spec still do some dmg in world pvp?  
---
What would you do?
---
These a rogue would roll on though, no? Seen more than a few rogues with unforgiven.
---
Who said they dont?  Bad players get kicked from serious guilds all the time.
---
Bye! Don’t come back. No one wants to hear your bitching here
---
Go die
---
With the spell batching the server feels more laggy than pservers on the other side of the planet
---
Awesome - thanks for the insight dude! That really makes a lot of sense and totally didn't know any of these mechanics existed. I'll be sure to start practicing waiting till my main hand goes off before pressing SS! Really appreciate it.
---
But if he had and actively paid attention to threat meters, he would know how much aggro he is going to cause with his first spell and how long to hold off before casting said first spell.
---
its not worth enchanting, period. That being said id love some hard numbers for both.
---
Man I wish we had death knights, I would tank without a word.
---
It's super sad to idealize someone who was a drug abuser and act like the bad stuff isn't important because they had a family. No one will shed a tear when Cosby dies. No one will say "well he WAS Really funny and inspired a lot of people before the news came out..."
---
druggies use any excuse to keep doing their drugs. zyzz did it so its okay!
---
YEET
---
depends on the Dungeon but 3-4% is usually enough
---
Actually no, it's not that simple xD.
---
You still usually one 1 sm/ruin lock for the imp buff on tanks and they will use corruption since they have nightfall.
---
SM ruin lock adds more total damage to the raid with their corruption then a DS ruin lock adds with their corruption. Nightfall procs add more damage from the insta shadowbolt then the 5% extra damage from ds adds to corruption. Especially when you factor in crits from nightfall procs triggering imp shadowbolt debuff. Idk what the spreadsheets say but I know how my guild does it and trust our stats maniac.
---
Don't use reddit to advertise your streams. Thanks.
---
Had a warlock in party once who used eye of kilrogg to scout for him from the alternative entrance
---
I think accepting losing out on a 5-8% DPS boost in order to still be able to farm effectively when you're not raiding isn't unreasonable. it's that or spam gold for a 1-point respec or farm without it which blows a whole lot more than not having that 5-8% DPS
---
He's not wrong, though
---
Well you let the tank die. So.
---
Yeah sure, the ones who took time to farm prebis aren't going to be the exact same ones who also have pvp sets. Suuuure.
---
Are you on stonespine?
---
Rogues will lose to a priest 1v1 if the priest initiates (because the rogue revealed themselves by trying to cap an unguarded flag in AB)
---
He’s there somewhere lol, nobody would stand still for family picture time haha
---
The community does do that.
---
Nobody cares if you have 98% good gear and are still trying to get that last bit.
---
They care if you show up to raid week after week with the 10th best item and don't try and get any better.
---
youre looking at everything through rose tinted glasses
---
heres a video from 2006 (pre TBC) of a frost mage aoe farming the hell out of all viable mob areas. these types of games inherently breed cookie cutter builds and minmaxing because no one wants to invest a ton of time into a sub-optimal build. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMeBA0D1LJY
---
its not the game, its the genre. its just the way it is, partner.
---
You are in for a rude awakening by aq40. Plenty of pserver guilds who got shit on by that raid.
---
We managed Ony 1 shot which is easy enough straight into MC. Was the greatest feeling good luck for next clear!
---
roids. roids are alongside weed in levels of danger in a drug. that was pretty much all he did, other than probably some other one off stuff at parties like a large percentage of the population does.
---
zyzz was an inspiration. cosby was a rapist. no comparison. stay mad x
---
60 rogue here, mining engi. Really struggling to make gold.. playing on gehennas so every mode of thorium there is always full of 10 people at least. 
---
Anyone got any tips for farming gold? I've tried povkpicketing in brd, and absolutely hated it. Ia there any good farming spots? Or any other good places to farm items/money? :(
---
&gt; When does the timer start if you dont reset anything?
---
When you leave party - instance would be reset.  
---
You never did it in SM?) It's the only way to search party in safety from Horde - exit SM, leave party and enter it back. New instance will spawn, where you could sit and search for new party to gather.
---
If you don't like it don't join his group. Find another tank, and quit your whingeing.
---
Either you didn't play vanilla or were super casual during it. You're acting like SM Ruin and DS Ruin weren't the only two viable raid specs back during vanilla as well. A lot of people seem to look back at vanilla with this perspective or narrative that everyone was completely ignorant and stupid back then, maybe many people were, but not everyone was. this isn't a "mix maxing bullshit attitude", back during vanilla any locks that were in a raid guild even barely into BWL once naxx came out were still specced SM Ruin or DS Ruin. I don't understand why people want to hard refuse intelligent talent specs and advocate playing something objectively sub  optimal. If you only want to quest, solo, or dungeon spam, then feel free. But if you are joining a guild that wants to work together to clear content and make progress, then choosing to play a sub par build is selfish, and if everyone in the guild did that, then they're not going to get much further in content. He can play whatever he wants, but " not you or the rest of his tryhard guild" - if someone wants to be in a tryhard guild, then they damn well better be playing the most optimized spec for their role, otherwise they can go ahead and choose to join a guild that doesn't give a shit.
---
Not against the rules of our sub, if you think this should be changed contact a mod. Thanks.
---
Choosing poorly would be wasting 100g per week and spending two days as a shitty solo spec for an absurdly marginal, entirely unnecessary gain to my healing output.
---
you re not really supposed to be hit by anything in mc.
---
You’ll start seeing more glass cannon mages once they get TOEPs. Right now i’d rather have survivability while raiding as well as the ability to farm
---
Yeah it’s OK. I mean BO 3&amp;4 weren’t a patch on BO2 for me but I can get away with this one.
---
Ahh my man! Have a few friends there! Both servers seem to be pumping!
---
I saw a bot in Hillsbrad the other day. I kept killing his pet and then he revived it... and this went on for a while until I saw it leave.
---
Haha Mr bigshot. 
---
Just be happy my dude! The world loves you.
---
For leveling combat is better due to the more available swords. At 60 it's probably best to be combat daggers or swords whatever better weapon you have
---
You sound like more of a cunt than the OP, but its like they say, shit doesn't know it stinks.
---
Even back in the day you would get made fun of if you flexed clearing mc...
---
Streams from random nobodies being spammed is not something that should be here. Simple as that. It's spam, nothing more.
---
But we are not on the pre TBC patch.
---
We are on 1.12. Yes a lot of class balancing has been done, but it is not pre tbc patch.
---
Not quickheal, but similar
---
What the deal with your family? Got any siblings?
---
Fury warriors say they aren't competing then roll need on plate that isn't a BIS but is a marginal upgrade for them at the moment.
---
What point? You moving the goal posts every post so you can go "AH HA GOTCHYA!"
---
Your original point was that everyone is wearing the same gear and it hurts your feelings / makes you sad.
---
Now it's about trying to prove that some guilds don't want to carry a guy in quest greens because 'he should be allowed to go'
---
You're a moron.
---
I'm currently SM Ruin, and I farm very well and very effectively without dark pact. I don't see any reason why anyone would need dark pact to "farm effectively" at lvl 60. Just get some mage food and water and then head off to farm. My guild wants me to respec to DS Ruin later on when content becomes more demanding, which I'm completely fine with. I'm SM Ruin now because its easier to farm and viable in both pve and pvp, but once P3 comes out and I'll be honor grinding, I'm going to be respeccing back and forth each week between DS Ruin and 7/7/37 for pvp.  If someone doesn't want to raid, then yeah sure be dark pact if you want to, who cares. But if someone wants to raid? Then go SM Ruin and get some water before you go out to farm. Unless you join a guild where everyone wants to raid as farming / solo specs and doesn't care to get very far in content, then that's a different story.
---
It looks like the first time in two months hes posted here, far from spam and what does it matter if he has 1mil followers or 0? This isnt a popularity contest and I definitely dont agree with special treatment only for famous streamers.

I found DM:W more challenging than UBRS or Onyxia
---
Are they? I reserve an orb for when I tank strat live all the time and no one has a problem with, they’re just grateful to have a tank.
---
Not really, this is a plan for the health of BG's.
---
Places like Herod for example are so horde heavy they would NEVER be able to do BG's.
---
Lol I doot sometimes sorry Clint
---
In theory, warden staff is the best defensive/migration in game, but they do fine with unyielding maul at MC/onyxia.
---
I bought it. Biggest regret. Unless you are planning on raid tanking and have a guaranteed spot do t buy it. Put money down the toilet. All Bcs It was “BIS” other then the gnomer wep. DO NOT BUY IT.
---
Agreed. I left the Vanilla and TBC prot warrior life because finding people worth tanking for is a pain in the ass. It seems like a substantial percentage of DPS (who probably have stayed dps throughout their time in wow) don’t understand half of what tanks and heals have to do to keep the dungeon run going. (Time to get downvoted). They never had to learn about tanking or healing mechanics.
---
It also stresses me out when I have to tell a new group of people not to make basic errors (like multi shotting sheep or standing next to a trash mob with aoe abilities as a ranged dps) whenever I run a dungeon. I’m now healing as a paladin. 
---
One other thing too is that when tanks aren’t well geared yet (for whatever reason, like having a life, or limited loot because of early server life), it’s harder for warrs to easily overcome aggro on multiple targets if the team is disorganized. It only gets worse as the mobs are not hitting you translating to less rage. 
---
Some people argue about “slower” runs, but I think they’re forgetting the time wasted from an increased likelihood of wiping or the healer going OOM after each fight (from healing leather-wearing non-shield warriors); both of which are much lower with a prot warr. As a healer in skeram I’m always glad to heal a warr actually specced to tank but they’re hard to find. 
---
Tbh I would 100% return to tanking if I had a solid group of buddies who would stick with me through the wow content. 
---
TL;DR: thanks for tanking.
---
Boomkin spec?
---
I half ass DPS a lot, going to get a drink or messaging etc. Cant really get away with that as a tank
---
I play on Herod one of the biggest NA servers and have done a ton of tanking in every dungeon. My bad experiences have been extremely rare and I almost never have a problem holding threat. I think these people complaining about tanking are just actually bad at tanking. They use the excuse of not knowing dungeons but it’s really easy to learn a dungeon layout and the correct pulls after a few runs, and keeping threat is easy you literally charge in demo shout and spam sunder/revenge and taunt anything that pulls off you you don’t even need to be prot spec. Even if I make a mistake and wipe us you just say my bad and people are pretty chill about it.
---
Depends a lot what you do. If you never go out into the world, only ride from Kargath/TP to BRM, and farm gold at the AH or in instances - get the gear. Your mount will never increase in price, while Lionheart Helm will only go up.
---
On the other hand, if you enjoy world pvp, gathering profs, or outdoor farming, get the mount.
---
Wait, how does that equal 5 combo points?

Either you’re under the age of 15 or under 90 IQ.

Those are the only two explanations for how you think
---
Are there any specific reason that you regretted it?
---
Dudes packing a nine inch nail.. am I right?  :D
---
15 old year game ,ofc its researched . Still people wipe on MC ,nerfed old raids .BWL ,AQ and Naxx will be harder sure ,will it be enough we will see. 
---
WoW was never heard hell if you just go back to retail ,do Cata and Wod raids now they would be easy as fuck.Cause strategies are known and game is researched as well.
---
how?  i tried but you can't open the gate as eye and you can't summon the eye by the time gate closes so you gotta step through the gate and then you get aggro even at 60
---
Maybe nowadays it is. I can see that. When I did my 1-60 it was godly lol.
---
Its got more upvotes than downvotes.  But yeah I don't wanna hear your complaining either there tex!  Enjoy.
---
On our class discord there is a video guide showing you exactly how to do it.
---
Not bad)
---
I think it’s possible that Shadowlands is a test to see if they could realistically just keep us locked at 60 and continue to develop new content to hold subscribers.
---
Yes that is true, you will have one SM Ruin lock and you will let that lock use corruption so that their dmg isn't massively gimped.
---
Yeah but we still have layers and at prime time on Sundays we still have a queue. A short queue but that shows the server is basically full.
---
You should ask for an invite so everyone can get the kill. If they don't invite you though go for it, steal all the tags you can get.
---
Name some.
---
Just keep in mind that Zandalar is a RP-PvP realm. Already got too many folks fleeing from queues and a:h ratios treating it like all the other PvP realms.
---
After going through Deadmines on a mage DPSing, a priest healing and a warrior tanking I can tell you that there is a *lot* more on a Tank's shoulders. We are herding cats frantically as DPS does a set rotation and Healing stays stationary choosing which heals to lay down on who. DPS and healing I went in blind but for tanking I had to go and look up a guide so I would know how to properly hold aggro (no wonder I was so shit at tanking back in Vanilla, had it *all* wrong) and use the best of my knowledge from my other two characters' runs: and I STILL wiped on the Goblin Foundry because I couldn't get those little engineer shits to move past the corner of the ramp once I LOSed them there.
---
It is more then marginally harder. To do it properly it **requires** knowledge of the dungeon, mastery of your class's threat mechanics (which are invisible without add-ons), split second decision making and the patience of a goddamn saint when you have DPS that not only refuse to focus skull but ALSO keep pulling because they don't like your pace.
---
Classic will go tbc I think it’s cheap and safe
---
Made me do a double take seeing our guild on here, you go Pacemaker. Anyway, speaking as an officer, don't ask why it's called OMEGA. It's a sordid story best left forgotten...
---
I am 16 on my new SPriest, seeing this is awesome.
---
Thanks
---
Edit- would this be viable and easier/harder on a Lock? just curious
---
Sounds like youre the only one being anecdotal. Do you even think before you comment?
---
Did you even read your own post?
---
Thanks for the help, I'll check it out :)
---
Me and my buddy would say soul arrow every time we cast it, super mundane and slow..
---
Soul.   Arrow..
---
Was amusing.
---
You want to track xp/hr and have it continue where you left off each time you login, correct?
---
I seem to remember there being a module for Titan panel back in the day, it might have even been a built in option.
---
I saw broken tooth but I'm a shaman, coincidentally an ally hunter was running by, so I ran over to him and started /beckoning him over. He timidly strafed his way over but shortly after me /pointing to him he threw down a frost trap and started taming. We exchanged a few /cheers and parted* ways.
---
Maybe he doesnt have much time to play anymore or has a lot of other expenses in game
---
They top out in fights sure. But they definitely don't outdps a lock or rogue in any pre-raid non-cleave instance, which I feel is the hardest to get a tank.
---
I guess what I was really hoping for was that I could have the macro execution cancel completely if the first string didn’t fire, thanks for the info!

---
We sure are.
---
don't worry, the fastest way is actually life tapping to equal health and mana and then eating and drinking. the only thing that's usually frowned upon is life tapping to top up mana and then expecting the healer to deal with your low hp (aka not eating)
---
Oh, no I haven't noticed that. Do you use any chat-related addons? I'm using Chatter, I know another popular one is Prat, and Leatrix has some chat options as well.
---
You can run SM Graveyard for the 12 Spell damage offhand really easily.
---
We can call you an idiot for signing up for a game that the devs said was meant to preserve the game how it used to be, and then complaining about there not being changes.
---
2H is better group threat management, and deals actual DPS. Good warrior just needs to know when to go into defensive stance.
---
or get mace with armor and tome of knowledge for good mitigation and better threat
---
&gt;Ya I actually kinda get mad at healers who "panic heal" me when I'm on my warlock
---
It's definitely something many healers do to themselves. It's just the wrong mentality. Sometimes people need to be topped off, but much of the time it's ok to let people sit at 70% health for a bit and heal themselves up. If there isn't raid damage going out and you try to spot heal a warlock who taps to 50% 1 second after they finished tapping, you didn't give them a chance to heal themselves so you have no right to complain about them needing healing. 
---
It's another thing entirely when they just tap to 20% and wait for heals between pulls, but of the 50+ max level dungeons I've done I've seen way more overzealous healers who just have to top everyone off instantly than I have warlocks who feel entitled to a pocket.
---
In my opinion that would be the way to go. They don't need to add more level grinds every expansion, just better gear, more instances, and more things to explore. The toy system in retail is pretty cool.  Little stuff like that wouldn't necessarily ruin the feel of the game. I have heard about how you can build your own house and farm and shit like that in retail too, would be cool to have a whole island where players and guilds could have a little sandbox world. I've always thought it would be awesome to have "guild halls" which are basically a dungeon or raid custom designed by a guild with a cool guild clubhouse at the end that you could port into to hang out with guild homies, have trainers and vendors there, access to auction house, etc
---
This is the worst response I've ever seen in any thread, anywhere.
---
The Unyielding Maul is just as good. I main tank MC as a feral Druid and I do have a Warden Staff because I was able to get a good deal on one. However, if that good deal had never come the Unyielding Maul is essentially the exact same weapon...
---
I use the built in floating combat text notification. I'm sure there's a weak aura for this too
---
Up to you to follow the guide as closely as you want. You *could* simply not follow the guide. Nobody is forcing you to do so. Its not the game's fault that it is "solved", its just an old game. But I mean its not like retail is any different, from what I last remember. I will say trying to push a mythic key was fun but if it was a shitty week then you just ran a 11, once, and just called it for that week.  
---
I dont know what youre wanting though, like.. why would people run a dungeon if it isnt going to drop something they dont want from there? Besides helping friends out. Dungeons arent exactly short and unless your group outgears it, all the end game dungeons take an hour **minimum**. Thats a long fucking time, even in WoW's sense of time.
---
If you have enchanting you can do RFD and disenchant the blues. SM Armory and Cath also net a good amount. Really you should just get some gear though as you just gotta run dungeons. Would highly suggest getting most of it before honor comes out so you can hold your own.
---
Benediction represent! Take an upvote.
---
Farm dungeons 54 to 60 then do the quests you skipped at 60
---
WeakAuras
---
If you see one cheap, it's always a good pick up. But the difference is so minimal it's barely worth it. If you want to get technical, pre-25agi, the Maul can be better if you have blacksmithing. I only use UM on trash anyway, usually use a MCP for bosses in MC

There is a weakaura that displays the overpower proc on the healthbar of the mob you can use it on.

The raids are easy either way. World buffs in raids are only required if you want to post cool looking logs or speedclear without deaths. If a group wipes there its almost certainly not a gear issue (unless maybe the MT is wearing devilsaur and a 2hand). And once you wipe the buffs are gone anyways.
---
That's not how it should work tho . If a rogue is specced specifically for daggers they should get it
---
Then do what you want, what stops you?
---
I played vanilla and did what I wanted, I'm playing now and doing what I want. I didn't follow BiS guides.. I ran dungeons and got whatever upgrades dropped, because I actually know what stats do what and what makes an upgrade an upgrade... I've seen so many people just dismiss something because it's "not BiS". Right but it's 2 strength off the BiS... you really wanna keep your green? OK cool.
---
Anyway I did that for a while, then when I had decent enough gear I joined a guild and started raiding and replaced most of it anyway.
---
You don't want to be in level 40 greens hitting up MC, but I promise you that any set of level 60 blue gear is fine if you know your class and how to play. People following BiS lists that don't actually understand the game are going to crumble as the game gets harder.

kings has a considerably lower mana cost to wisdom, so it only becomes more efficient than consecration (or other blessings) because of the low mana.
---
My suggestion to you if you want a more challenging experience (and your guildies do as well), would be to run Molten Core in smaller raids.
---
For example, run as 2 20man raids. Has the bonus of giving you more of a challenge, and gearing you all up for future content (which you may find more challenging) faster.

The gear we have in WoW now always isn't the same as guilds first had available in MC.
---
hes obviously talking about BGs
---
HEY IM IN THAT SUB TOOOO LOOK MOM I FINALLY MADE SOMETHING OF MYSELF
---
Download the addon Questie for starters. You can set it up to show quests how many levels above and below your level. As for somebody writing up a guide for you, this game has been around since 2004. YouTube is your friend.
---
Could you link the spec?
---
Any more on those numbers? Obviously dps isn't a big issue on MC but I'd like to be able to justify using soul link for \*reasons\* (phase 2 and my faction is &lt;40% of the server)
---
It’s more like: he thinks his shit don’t stink.. 
---
That’s what you were referring to at least. Hey at least we can agree OP is a cunt tho haha
---
thats how it was in classic tho
---
Lol tough guy
---
Farm blindweed in swamp of sorrows
---
Because I have a skill, and they have a skill, that let's us not have to.
---
That's like asking, why not eat shit everyday when you could be eating food.
---
If the mana is there a hot is no skin off a healers back, there's literally zero issue with it besides the meme and people who are dicks to priests about it.
---
I'm not a dick, I don't ask for a heal, I normally don't expect it. But if you're just standing there at full mana and nobody else in the party is falling apart at the seams then you're a lazy healer.
---
I'm not a lazy warlock. I do my summons, pass out cookies, keep souls tone up, and I lifetap between most pulls to keep us moving forward.
---
If everyone stops to drink then I drink, if the group has momentum I'm not gonna slow that down because reddits trying to teach healers that tossing a hot after a lifetap is bad.
---
Depends on the dungeon. Lower levels you don't need a tank (SM, ZF). Higher level it is nice to have one (brd, lbrs)
---
Pally Tanks are adds tanks. I never said I was a main tank.
---
https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table is a very good read
---
up to 308 it's absolutely amazing (as in, increases your raid DPS by a large amount)
---
308 to 315 it's decent, nothing amazing, make sure you aren't sacrificing too much for it
---
315+ it's silly
---
You're gonna have aggro problems in this spec.
---
True. Healers love Life Tap, they can epeen healing meters.
---
stopping for food and water all the time means farming less effectively
---
plus for 1 talent point you don't have to rely on mages outside of raids and healers not being OOM in raids, seems pretty reasonable to me unless your raid is seriously hurting for damage output
---
Unyielding + Counterweight is considered better by a lot of people right now, due to no agi enchant
---
Buy an Umbral Crystal off the AH.
---
People still use DKP?
---
You equate someone using PEDs to achieve their fitness goals with a rapist and you think everyone else in here are the degenerates? Lol
---
guys... the podium it's...
---
*hah hah hah*
---
HA HA HA HA HA!
---
**YOU'RE CRAZY! HOW DID YOU PULL THIS OFF?!**
---
Min max wise the warden staff is just slightly better. But really there isn't a point in wasting that kind of money for it. Just stick with the maul and be happy.
---
Are the Dusty tomes always there and contain nothing sometimes? Or random chance of being there?
---
Buffs fall off, did you not look at the threat meter? Regardless of their salv buff being there, I was still #1 on the threat meter. And in the second one when everyone had their salv buff the HEALER had aggro. Do you even pay attention?
---
Many of the guides aren't very good or contain detailed information. They're basic. A lot of what's on the BIS charts are situational and changes depending on circumstances. If you just copy the general BIS gear lists, you're probably playing poorly and didn't bother to understand anything about the game.
---
That being said, classic was always easy. 1.12 Spell power gear made it even easier. Years of collecting information made it easier, and the fact is the average gamer is just better now than they were then makes it easier.
---
Should they have tuned content to be harder? I think so, absolutely, it was a mistake not to. But you know the nochanges crowed voice was the loudest. Even though they weren't the majority of people playing the game.
---
Finaly you always have the option to make the game harder for yourself. Create a guild that use meme specs. Doesn't use bis gear, and only raids with a limited number of people to start with. Let's say instead of starting with 35-40, you start with 25-30. Good luck with that though, truth is most people just want easy mode.
---
Yea get the haste enchant
---
or maybe it's easier to not have them and have people criticising you for your spec and not your play
---
It was literally the difference between last night and this morning.
---
You realize the entire group was using it right? If a person isn't using it their name doesn't show up on the meter.
---
I think for some classic could go on forever and they'd be happy, which is why private servers were so successful for so long, but for the majority they'll need something more. Whether it be classic+ or tbc and on. It'll be interesting to see how blizz handles things if they do TBC as far as a separate server or forcing classic players to move on.
---
Mats, consumes, twink  i items, etc.
---
I run both.
---
&gt; What happens if you dont leave a group (or are the leader) and run different instances? When does the timer start if you dont reset anything?
---
I'm not sure what happens if you're the leader and the other 4 leave. I'd imagine you don't get a reset.
---
&gt; Though that means 12 min runs are a myth.
---
Correct. You need 15 minute runs to never face a lockout.
