Cool story

---
---
Yeah I didn't foresee AV being better honor unfortunately. That means the majority of people playing WSG are either trying to beat AV honor by being in a premade, or have already hit exalted in AV and want to work on WSG.
---
I'll replace it in 4 lvls in
---
As a mage, I love going up against solo warriors
---

---
A warrior with a paladin/shammy/priest friend on the other hand is someone to run away from really quick.
---
In Spy options, you can choose "Invert the Spy window". Then it will grow vertically instead.
---
You dont actually stealth tho you just get snare/root break which is how it always worked from vanilla till Pandaria when I quit playing.
---
But you are gonna have a bad time in harder tiers with your 16 rets tho...
---
Visit a doctor mate.
---
&gt; True no changes would have been a progression of the game from 1.1 as it existed originally all the way through the final version of the game.
---
Call me crazy, but that sounds like fun, warts and all.
---
I want to go check out walled-in Andorhol again.
---
Its just a nice change of pace sometimes since you get 3.3k xp every time you turn in 3 marks on honor.
---
I love how the ice Poseidon Reddit made the Andy meme and everyone still uses it 
---
Good video too 10/10
---
It's pretty entertaining to read all the comments that seem predicated on the idea that the poster's guild has a surplus of mats and gold.
---
Don't get comfortable, boys and girls, the cost of raiding is about to shoot through the roof over the next several months.
---
did you know there are communities of young boys that fuck peoples moms on xbox live? should we just.. NOT talk about how there are communities of mom-fuckers in video games?
---
You're getting uber-j'baited to the maximum if you get upset over some users in an mmorpg getting their rocks off by typing racist shit into their keyboard.  there's a lot of edge lord neck bears that play this game. they exist. they're out there. they're going to do what they do. which is be pathetic miserable pieces of trash. 
---
so much easy trollbait out there these days, it's pathetic.
---
Allow me to use your faulty logic with regards to all your assumptions. People that make assumptions are stupid. You are stupid. 
---
Harsh language =/ Mad
---
Making assumptions =/ Stupid
---
Get it dip shit?
---
Did your fuck up hurt only you - then w.e
---
Did your fuck up hurt the entire raid - then you probably should have watched a couple strategy videos before joining
---
If you're not on Grobbulus you're missing out tbh
---
Exactly, furry is the type of person to populate a role play server, thanks for proving my point
---
Guess people really hate rogues since they're  downvoting this haha. It really does suck.   
---
Generally rogue just feels like a class that is heavily influenced by batching in its current form.
---
Even distract is batched. People hit you while stunned, blinded etc. Kills the reactionary gameplay that makes the class so fun.
---
One up him and give the next one to a boomkin.
---
Red arrow is stratholme if hou look at the warcraft 3 map of lorderon its the same spot
---
Selling a PEndulum of Doom here
---
No you’re the furry, silly
---
Quickclickz is right it's 15 minutes exactly now. I know through more trying than I want to explain. The 2 hour thing went away a long time ago.
---
&gt;just wait until TBC
---
Did I miss an important announcement or are you jebaiting me.
---
What are your favorite warrior weapons? Do you agree with list? What would you change?
---
werent deadwood and winterspring tribes corrupted by legion tho?
---
Cept the AB tabard is better in every way.
---
windows 10 has that function built in but it kinda sucks. doesn't hurt performance much but getting it to start is finnicky and sometimes it just decides its not gonna wok

Farming Hederine Slayers in Winterspring near the gorge/bridge that drops into the Frostmaul Giants.
---
I get jumped by a Rogue, I pop basically everything trying to survive (it's a bitch of a run bacK), he uses most of his cooldowns to try get me. I cripple my way to the bridge, pop slow fall as I'm falling thinking I'm safe and that the Rogue wouldn't be stupid enough to follow me.
---
I land, and start drinking/eating to recover... A second later a fresh rogue corpse appears right next next to me from the sky and immediately releases + spirit resses.
---
Best place to farm felcloth? I killed the people in felwood south of Jaedenar for over an hour and didn’t get a single one
---
At some point they added a short (.5 or 1 second) invulnerability for this reason.  May have been in tBC tho.
---
Try to kill Satyrs, not the players.
---
This weapon lasts easily into your 30s, enchant it with fiery IT'S TOTALLY WORTH IT, ENCHANT IT!!
---
Like respeccing holy for raids
---
What is an SL lock???
---
I definitely can't disagree with that.  I've definitely had a lot of fun bullshitting with these guys and gals over the last few months.  We are still sorting some shit out and recruiting more people, but we have a super solid group of 30 guys right now, and leadership mostly knows what the fuck we are doing.
---
Sounds like a horde problem
---
Well, if it's an 8 minute run that's actually 4 minutes faster than it needs go be. You want 12 minute clears to avoid the lockout. I run it in about 6-7 on my paladin. Takes 4 pulls.
---
The only reason people run Moonglow is because it's mana efficient and hots drops buffs off of tanks. 
---
If it's a quick fight and buff aren't a problem you should all be swiftmend.
---
never thought of people not defending the summoner, lol, that would make it last forever, yeah, haha.
---
An I've never even seen the tree. I haven't lost a singe game that lasted over 30 mins. Alliance seem to not care about that, don't know if u guys have equivalent to our flightmasters but neither have seen them.
---
Ice Lord stays 10 min in the middle, so there is a chance to
---
Lol which is why the game is over for me once I reach end game. 
---
Raiding is basically a different game that I’m not interested in playing.
---
I mean I understand what you´re trying to say. But what is so painful about to zoom a picture on a phone? It takes less than one second and can be done with one hand.
---
And the rest of the picture isnt just useless white space. Two guys asked about addons in this thread and can therefore expand there UI. For them it wasnt just useless white space.
---
Last time I tried with LoL it had some major problems.  Overwatch gives you a lower fov when playing in ultrawide, they intentionally made it worse and even then it's only up to 21:9. I don't play PoE but Destiny 2 is one of the only other games that actually work flawlessly.
---
I don't know if it's the 'best' but the Satyr's in Azshara drop it, they're low level and it's usually pretty quiet.
---
Personally I farm the Hederine Slayers in Winterspring, they're much tougher but they seem to drop it relatively commonly and even have a chance at the Eye of Shadow.
---
I solo warrior in a bg is like half a character.
---
And how does that shed any light on my question?
---
its sooo good. I grabbed Beserker buff in WSG yesterday and unleashed this in a big mid team fight. soooo many numbers
---
Yes, they are diminishing.  
---
Also IIRC all Seal effects have Procs-per-minute limitation, so you can't make SoJ stun more often with fast weapon.
---
This is correct. And it's still not nearly as wide as this monitor, so OP would have zoomed in fov *and* black bars.
---
this aint vanilla bruh its classic
---
This is more of a problem that comes from how blizzard created classic wow rather than vanish specifically. Fixing it would require fixing spell batching.
---
Mage + hunter isnt an option because those are your mains
---
Warrior/druid tank + druid/priest/pally healer would be ideal for forming dungeon groups
---
You're right that orc's have something similar going on but it's importantly different for orcs because Deathbringer is a stronger item than Vis'Kag in a vacuum. DB would always be bis for horde with VK being worse because of windfury. This applies to all races on horde.
---
Also flurry axe is the bis offhand for orcs and it is just BARELY worse than Brutality Blade or Core Hound Tooth for non-orc horde warriors since all serious horde warriors are orc or have edgemaster's. Deathbringer and Vis'Kag are actually the 4th and 5th best offhands respectively behind all of the options above.  
---
Why is flurry axe so good? Because the proc generates another mainhand hit which generates more rage so despite being lower dps with no additional stats the rage generation from flurry axe is excellent. In fact Deathbringer mainhand with flurry axe offhand is still better than Doom's edge offhand from BWL.
---
Soul link. It’s a talent spec that makes them tanky as hell
---
Idk if I had to pick what’s more pathetic that or spending endless hours farming mats and items in raids so that you can... farm mats and items in the next raid, and min max everything according to guides online where smarter more prepared people “solved” it for you, I think that’s worse.
---
its crazy how almost everyone from herod, faerlina and whiteman is a bitter misanthrope edgelord that thinks they are unique and hilarious. i can't imagine playing there
---
Not sure but I hope not, I like cosmetics.
---
*Furiously presses my 1 button harder* HOW DO I INCREASE MY SKILL ON THIS!?
---
Herod and Whitemane too
---
Funny how attached you can get to them eh?
---
Thats pretty much what I did back in the day, 2 pets in the stables for "group" activities, and then *my* pet, which was a white crocolisk called Stumpy.
---
The actual honor number doesn't matter at all. It's how you rank among your faction.
---
Freezing band is worth over 700g on my server.
---
So is your reasoning for 350g for Maiden's being absurd because you can use a 700+g ring instead?
---
I grind dungeons all day as a tank and I don’t have anywhere close to 2k gold? Soo either you are lying or you are doing other things for gold income.
---
I’m a paladin so I usually use /cast divine shield followed by a /cast hearthstone
---
In arena you would just wait for polymorph to end while RMP is killing your friends. Battlegrounds, especially AV, are the best PvP scenario there is for warriors.
---
Cc them kill the vw
---
The potion I mentioned removes 1 magic effect every 5 seconds for 30 seconds. That’s probably the best thing out there as far as I know. It works well against mages because you can use it just before getting sheeped and it’ll remove the first sheep almost immediately and then remove any re-sheeps too.
---
If you go through the portal no one else can use it anymore, curiously.
---
How long is it repeatable?
---
If spamming the same button every GCD for the entire raid night sounds fun to you, it sounds like you should've rolled a mage or warlock.
---
Well why does it matter if he already has hand of rag, the one without can just farm it after solo. Should have just let them roll for it.
---
As a mage, I AP+PoM pyro and hope it insta kills them or I lose.
---
if alliance is that far into horde base then recalling is just gonna lead to you dying instantly. I only recall late game if my AoE trinkets are up so I can pop eranikus n the middle of a crowd then throw an un'goro fire charge at my feet. I'm dead a half second later but its worth it to delay.
---
The only thing it would be replaced by in "4 levels" is a boe blue.
---
Like freezing band isnt twice as expensive lol!
---
Sounds like something out of EVE or the original Star Wars Online, where someone just straight up wants a player dead.
---
I killed the water elemental in winterspring today.
---
Your pet only needs 43% of your hp to be able to absorb your full health bar for soul link. Unless you currently have over 5k hp your felhunter should easily cut it, considering they have like 2400 hp or something at 60.
---
Ayy lmao
---
And innervate, and crit aura
---
This was the predicted outcome, it’s not a suprise, therefore I will refer you to paragraph one, section one, line 1
---
1. no changes
---
Indeed..
---
People don't. I only deal in throwaway accounts. It will get dumped in January.
---
My guild purchased and edgemasters so that wouldnt happen with the axes.
---
My guild got it on our first kill, and have gotten 2 Eyes in the first three weeks..lol, but no Sulfuron Ingots, so it all balances out LOL
---
WoW is fun. Parties are also fun. If you showed up at my party and drank and ate more than your fair share, I doubt I'd ever notice. If you were also stirring shit and starting drama at my party, well, now I'm paying attention.
---
I doubt anyone in the raid is under the impression that the Ret is a meaningful contribution to clearing content, and apparently they didn't mind either since they have 2, but once you start some shit, well, enjoy the attention you've drawn to yourself.
---
you get everyone to click at the same time and hope for the best.
---
But those solo DM E ores as sham so nice.
---
Fuck bud, calm down and pop a cold one eh.
---
&gt;Be thoughtful about what you need from your class trainer.
---
This is key to getting your mount. You DO NOT need eye of killrogg and, depending on your playstyle, probably not health funnel either.
---
So is SL, which gives you effectively 1.43 health bars. If you can't survive burst with effectively 8000 hp you're an idiot.
---
I would do something like this while leveling with a hunter if your goal is to just blow up one mob at a time and keep moving, this build wont work nearly as well as a drain tanking build though if you end up solo leveling. 
---
I would also recommend writing a macro to cast your imps firebolt and tie it to your shadow bolt ability, then just spam away. Once you have the destro talent to lower your imps cast time if you just let him cast at will he will only cast every 2 seconds making this talent useless unless you make the macro.
---
I would also make sure to try and finish every mob while channeling rank 1 drain soul once you have the talent for the mana regen. There are addons and macros you can find that will auto destroy extra soul shards you generate to keep your bags manageable.
---
Below is the talents including order I would try out if I was leveling with a hunter buddy.
---
Best of luck out there, Warlocks are super versatile and a blast to play!

So about half of any regular melee dps
---
When explaining realm times, I've told people for years that RP-PVP is the realm for people who can actually write sentences.
---
The red zone is called Quel'Thelas (despite what the map says!) - and I have been to that zone more than several times in Retail. 
---
Ovolmase's description of it is accurate. It is glitchy in the sense that the flight ceiling is about one inch, so your mount is gasping for air when walking on the ground.
---
The part with the tower by the ocean is one of the most beautiful places in Azeroth.
---
There's a certain spot in Stratholme dungeon where you can walk through the wall and into Quel'thelas in Retail. I'm not high enough level in Classic to try it yet. 
---
Also, going there is probably against the rules. But nobody I know has ever gotten in trouble for doing so. We even held a guild meeting there once!
---
Are there no enhance shamans horde side?
---
But which one is doing seal of wisdom? Probably the one with slightly lower dps?
---
you don't get to dominate wpvp and have short BG queues.
---
Suck it up or reroll alliance.
---
mad and bad
---
Yeah I'm amazed they have 2 rets, we have 6 pallys, but only 1 ret
---
yikes
---
Venruki did an overview of his duels against each of the classes he fought in the dueling tournament. Really insightful. I'm sure that equal skill SL is unbeatable but on average you have a lot of room to surpass the normal player.
---
C
---
oh no people pvp'd in a BG, the horror
---
Oh shutup you fucking dad gamers are so ridiculous, AV is an instance just like MC. The only objective is to get what you need from the instance to enhance your WORLD experience. 
---
I bet you wouldn't want to spend 6 hours in MC for "the experience" eh? Everyone know what AV is, the mystery is gone. Let people grind their honor in peace.
---
&gt;players who are not R8+ following the reset are currently not on curve to reach R10
---
I'm rank 5 right now projected to hit 6.5 next week. I will be getting rank 10 several months from now with 0 stress, just playing the same amount I am right now. When that happens, I will come back to this post and remind you that you're wrong. Fuck your "curve"
---
And that is what I've had to do, but it's a shame having to see my fully bis warrior go to waste after close to 1k hours /played. 
---
And those players never proposed a solution, except for making changes to the actual world that would make a massive impact on how we play the game, so dont really see how your argument makes sense here
---
How does someone even get sulfuron hammer solo?
---
E
---
I highly doubt that.do you have screenshots?
---
It varies wildly. Today I was in a 30 minute AV win and got ~1150 rep. Queue times in horde are around 15 minutes during the day it seems. Using your short wins and mine from today: 
---
30 min win ÷ 15 min queue = 45 minutes for 1150 rep
---
 15 min queue + 7 min win = 22 minutes for 550 rep x 2 = 44 minutes at 1100 rep
---
So with current queue times and people turning stuff in, it's a wash. However, say all games are losses: long game you get 800 rep vs 400 for short games. That win is a lot more pivotal in the short games because the sheer mass of turn ins can really pile up along with tower destructions, etc
---
Well, players on alliance dominated servers? Your argument makes no sense at all
---
Void sac lasts 30s. When they sac, you sheep, run away, block to remove dots when out of range and eat/drink. It's a fight reset.
---
Warlocks are super annoying for casters to fight against in general.
---
You and the pally from this story should start a guild together called &lt;Overly Sensitive Babies&gt;
---
how does one realistically get the mats for rag hammer? buy gold?
---
I heard of a tale, that years ago a group of 10 adventurers ventured through Darrowshite. They had one goal; to battle the scourge and take back their town! They fought for hours, days, and the scourge kept coming back. Teams of adventurers came and went, as did the years. But that original group remained, determined to outsmart those brainless zombies. 
---
Last I heard they never did take back that town. 
---
Some say if you listen closely you can still hear their calls. I like to think they fell in battle, overcome by ego and a will to win. So in a way, Darrowshite was won, they have their town. They’re just brainless zombies.
---
Was expected, it's the same on retail. Horde have queues because more pvpers play horde.
---
Queues were just as long in vanilla.   This is what happens when you roll the more popular faction. Only difference now is alliance queues are instant instead of like 5 mins max.
---
It is THE thing late game as usual. I still remember rogues QQ'ing because warriors were rolling on leather pants.
---
He said they don't? Are you just hollering at clouds?
---
Nobody really knows. But this post isn't targeted at someone like you who seems to understand the system. HonorSpy is all you need to figure out how much honor you need to farm each week.
---
You have almost 42 days /played ....
---
Wut ?
---
Don't pick the easy mode faction next time?
---
Who cares, the meta to rank in classic pvp is AV and not WSG, this version of "vanilla WOW" is clearly trash.
---
Not like dis, mon. Not like dis.
---
yeah from the PoV of +0.5 dps that whole fuckfest isn't worth it
---
I think it's funny that people complained about attunements when pathfinder is like 10x more agonizing for me.
---
You never said what? Yous said hunters locks and enh are top dps? Like, it's literally right in your comment lol
---
I could be wrong but my understanding of the Duskwood Worgen is that they are brought from another world/realm/emerald dream and are just rabid beasts.
---
How? It prompts people to kiss but it doesn't force it. Whenever it's portrayed in media there is a moment of connection between the two people where consent is established or not and based on that they kiss or not.

I have one too and you don't move your neck at all, you move your eyes like a normal person.

Paid migration is almost confirmed to happen, I feel like blizzard has changed enough things already that this would only make sense

Yes.

If everybody in your party has DBM you could use /dbm pull 5 so everyone gets a countdown. Need to be in a raid for it to work, party didn't work for us for some reason. Or you can use a chat macro.
---
Yeah 100%. I bet you the class hall/war campaign equivalent, unlocking all M+, zone main questline + pathfinder are at worst equivalent if not way more annoying.
---
You sound very insecure.
---
I am a dwarf and I’m digging a hole
---
It’s hard to get that many players on the same page. Someone WILL fuckup in almost every raid.  It’s totally normal and there’s no point thinking anything of it other than being mindful of what killed you next time.
---
If you go to a raid and you’re not prepared to die a couple times then you shouldn’t be raiding.
---
Boromir: It is a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt over so small a thing. Such a little thing.

5 mins max? Horde queues are, and i shit you not, over 20 minutes

This, this is genius.

The irony!

Pathfinder was fine I guess, only because they release them well after you have all the launch reps at exalted, but I'd prefer to just go back to the WOTLK method.
---
Guys, I’m just here for arenas.

&gt; who usually gets slightly higher dps

wow, micropenis syndrome at it again

It's AV right now. In a week or two, it'll be WSG.

I'm sorry you've never seen Big Daddy. It's a good one.
---
I'm going to 8 as a warrior. The helm and shoulders can be made up by ony and bwl. Ain't nobody but the neckbeardiest of the neckbeards is going to hit 12+
---
Hey at least you didn't have a Warrior take the Eye from a Shaman, after the Shaman already got, because "it's what is good for the guild". Lmao.
---
I was fishing deviates in the barons after hitting 60 really early on. I had flagged myself just for fun. (Human Priest btw) Two low levels (15-25 range I forget) walked up to me like I was a sight to see. They were both flagged, but I'm not one to run around killing lowbies- and it was phase 1 anyways so it wouldnt have mattered. Anyways they were clearly in a group and just jumping around me and emoting and all that. I found it funny, blew them kisses and danced with them before going back to fishing. But even though I was fishing they didnt seem deterred to jump all around me and keep having fun. So, I turned and mind controled one and started beating his friend with his other friend. I could NOT stop laughing as the guy ran away from his friend, and as my MC victim ran away after. Funniest shit I've ever watched.
---
Batching has some interesting interactions that made the original wow trilogy more interesting.
---
&gt;I take an hour a day or two before raid to do a dm tribute, go grab song flower, and then I park him in org until an ony buff is going out.
---
This is not reasonable to ask of 40 people in a dad guild. When you're doing this before every raid you're at a pretty hardcore 
---
&gt;This isn’t a case of “skill”, this is a case of apathy. 
---
you'll find out in the real world there's little difference between the two.
---
&gt; There is basically no skill involved in understanding your classic rotation, for most classes it’s 1-3 buttons with few being more in depth than that. 
---
Yah there is, how many hours did you sit down and look through the theorycrafting guides and figure out what is what? For most people playing wow classic, they hop on and want to play, anything past that is more dedication than the majority of people are willing to put in. About the best you can ask of them is to go read the BiS wowhead and try to run some dungeons for that. 
---
What you think is normal and average is not.
---
Thank you very much for the prompt response. I'll be giving this a read.  
---
To confirm something - Tomorrow is the day of the reset?
---
I would recommend an addon called HonorSpy. It keeps an active pool of your rank and bracket.
---
I did Rag for the lulz on Retail awhile back. First clear, eye drops.
---
For sure and thanks for this post its really good!
---
*Blizzard announces Classic: BC*
---
I love my ultra-wide monitor. No stretching just wider FoV. Congrats it’s nice!
---
Last time there was a thread like this one Reddit, I complained about my guilds terrible luck, getting two eye of memes in &lt;10 kills and stayed that I’d trade those eyes for bindings any time. Then the next raid we got both bindings in one evening. Our tank is very happy
---
It’s totally fine to fuck up during any raid. The thing that isn’t ok is when people ask if you know the fight, and you lie. Everybody was new at some point, and overcoming the “raider fear” is an important step to actually enjoying raiding. Everyone dies to dumb stuff all the time, don’t sweat it
---
Play you.

https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/JxD3fRqab2KkdTwN
---
As a warrior if u have a felhunter out ill destroy u, but if u have voidwalker to sacrifice ill never be able to beat u.
---
its only the best blue caster dps ring, along side the quest reward from BRD.
---
I think I see your point but think it's better to agree to disagree here.  Good conversation though and thanks for explaining your view.
---
Pretty sure it was just there to show up on the minimap
---
It doesn’t seem like it. I read a lot about how it could be possible before classic released, but I got 400k honor this week and am barely going to rank up from rank 6 51%. I would say I made roughly 10-12k honor per hour in AV. So you can figure out just how many hours I dumped into it for barely half a rank up.
---
What the fuck kind of weapon/gear do you have to do 800 dps?  Esfand, when he had literally EVERY possible buff including power infusion and over 40% crit was only able to pull 650 dps.
---
Tell that to people wavedashing frame perfect in melee you goon
---
You mean the ONE pvp server?
---
Yeah if it's guaranteed to be against a warrior like a duel or what ever, sure. But this guy was asking about general situations, where you're gonna want felhunter out 8/10 times.
---
A black horse with white stripes or a white horse with black stripes?
---
is that the -50 dkp guy?
---
Yay Sulfuras Horde!
---
It's wow, not counter-strike, the difference in competitive performance would be negligible.
---
Random rogue but tell me how you feel please
---
We had onslaught, bre, and perdition's drop at the same time.  Pretty wild.  No bindings or eye.  Been running for close to 3 months.
---
i was told that i need to move my melee out. in and out.
---
how about rank 13? please don’t say more than 100 hours a week 😂😂
---
I'm on a pve lower pop server. I'm currently top honor 
---
this week at 600k. Currently rank 6 75%
---
My expectations is to reach rank 14 in about 6-7 more weeks if I can maintain bracket 14. 
---
Tomorrow I'll be rank 8. Next week hopefully rank 10. Then I'm expecting ranks 10-11 and 11-12 1 week each. With 12-14 taking 4 weeks.
---
onyxiareset.com
---
Nice
---
I think thats hardcore incorrect. That shield is the single thing that makes warlocks so powerful, if u have no voidwalker u have no way to survive large burst, sure u may be able to win fights with the felhunter but leaving urself without that shield leaves u extremely vulnerable when u could be unkillable
---
This is basically a second copy of Eye of Orgrimmar (with an extra 2 spirit). The only better ring casters can get right now is Ring of Spellpower (and Freezing Band if you’re a mage, but that’s another story).
---
Not for allies who will always have instant queue and can abuse a system that gives you the number of the game for no reason to form premades and crush a game in 8 minutes for 3k honor, WSG will never compare without heavy nerfs to AV.  My WSG team crushes pugs in 6-8 minutes, we can't compete.  Also this system will allow these "rankers" to queue dodge other WSG premades, something my team would never do.  Ranking in classic is not about pvp at all and it sucks.
---
They aren't repeatable though are they?
---
True.... you're point is valid
---
modern problems require modern solutions
---
Unless I'm mistaken, its in the Blizzard EULA that they can scan your files
---
&gt;Kuney
---
The other thing too is, I don't click on the bar frames. I really dislike clicking the mouse so I always keep the cursor centered on my screen. If I can get myself used to clicking on those bar frames, I bet it would help my PvP more. I have been thinking about moving Spy to my top right corner and let it grow down. 
---
Plus I use Track Humanoids so that helps a ton already.
---
You have Ret pallies is probably the bigger problem
---
I'm sorry nobody paid attention to you as a child. I hope failing to get rank 14 because you can't keep pace with the botters doesn't make you too upset. 
---
You seem like the sensitive type so I'll be rooting for you.
---
Yea you collect boxes 10 at a time from around the time. There’s a quest you grab before doing it
---
I was in that game with you!  I must have been just as amazed as you.  Even the guy who suggested wiping the horde at Belinda admitted that he wasn't entirely serious.  The horde must have been so absolutely tilted, sadly none of the other games I played yesterday could hold a candle to that one.
---
/u/vredditshare
---
What build are you talking about? Cause with SL you already have massive hp, felhunter kick and dispel is insanely useful against tons of classes. No one can burst through 8800 effective hp, even rogues popping literally everything can't burst that.
---
No no no... that was 15 runs over the span of 2 casual nights of playing. Formed pug groups as fast as i could and ran in. I told everyone what loot i needed and what I didn't . Literally no one needed that offhand. Even the tank he gave 50g as an apology and me n him are cool still
---
TBC is going to be an interesting experiment.
---
How bored are people gonna get of arena when the meta never, ever changes with class balance?
---
Do they release 2.4.3 with all of the heavily nerfed raids and no attunements?
---
I think it's somewhere in the night from tuesdays to wednesdays; I'm not entirely sure though.
---
Yikes. Presumably that’s double for Horde then?
---
AV will slow down as people turtle more. One bad AV destroys your honor / hour, and bad AVs will happen much more often after the initial hype dies down.
---
Thanks for the info mate. 
---
I'm 100% not in any rush so I'm not worried about efficiency.  
---
Herb/alch was just because of the use of consumables
---
As a druid, you run.. a lot, until wsg pop safes the day
---
Priests being hard to gear up? What you been smoking son.
---
What server? Not as competition; I just like low pops
---
Raids?  I believe you.  But man, I've decided both Prot Palys and Feral Druids are significantly superior to warriors for 5 man dungeons.  Shit sticks to them like glue.
---
Recount is must for me too
---
I am playing Shaman. I'm saying I think warrior is the most fun class. Ele sham is awesome though
---
They just need to make it 100 rep per flag cap and 100 per 3 marks. It would still be significantly slower than AV but it would be reasonable. For some reason u only get 50 rep for warsong and 100 for av (turn ins) it makes no sense why this would be the case
---
There more profit to sell ingots and buy arcane bars, there need 100 for tf ~5k gold. 
---
Be he bought ingots from guild bank with 50% off ah price.
---
I can KIND OF understand why someone would bring one ret pally....but two? Wtf lol. Those paladins should be happy with whatever they get and should never complain about anything. They are very very lucky to have a raid spot as ret.
---
Turtling is an RTS concept. Part of the rock paper scissors of general strategy: 
---
Turtle - play defensively in hope of countering an enemy rush 
---
Rush - attack as fast as possible 
---
Boom - focus on economy/long term investments. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Rush &gt; Boom &gt; Turtle &gt; Rush &gt; Boom &gt; Turtle &gt; ...
---
arcanite reaper exists. but go off with your incorrect memes.
---
I’ve been bending over and taking it in BGs.
---
I consistently do more DPS than any other hunter in the raid while having worse loot.  You can reduce things down to clicking hard, but it is something that takes skill and effort.  And I promise, hunter has one of the simplest rotations of any class.
---
No changes? They increased server population 5x. That in itself is a HUGE change. Just look the state of leveling on PvP servers.
---
Let's be honest, the 1-10 druid experience is way better at making people not want to play a druid than anything else ever created.
---
20 to 30 hours is nothing. oceanic battlegroup we dealing with up to 60 minute queues.
---
Thats not going to happen often lol gj to your guild op
---
you generally want 5 paladins for blessings, but you don't need 5 holy pala healers. 3-4 tops.
---
i don't really have a problem. 
---
i pugged all the end game content available right now and instead of just raid logging with a random guild that recruited me, i've decided i want to be a part of making a 40 man roster of people new to the game/veterans that are taking their time leveling/friends that i've made playing. this post is more for the crowd of people getting bored right now (the "semi-hardcore" people)
---
Yep i.m stunned reading all those truly shameful comments. words like optimal classes, kicking rets and or hybrids lmao. It.s supposed all these twats had grown up and possibly have more than 2 digit iqs. but alas...very sad idd.
---
Everything is viable as long as there are at least 25 good specs to carry you.
---
Which still means they need 7 turn-ins of 10, which makes it odd that only 5 are going
---
I believe Mik Scrolling Battletext has this functionality as well.
---
That’s not true. You can even make a portal, go through, then invite people from where you ported from. They’ll be able to go through with no issues.
---
If it had touched him, he would understand It's grace. Moving.
---
My friend was tanking BRD on his warrior and I was healing on my priest. We just killed Fineus and he jumps on the ledge of the walkway and proceeds to fall into the lava and dies. Our group all run over and one of them misjudges the jump to the ledge and follows to the fiery depths. The other two /shrug and follow the first two. One manages to find a safe ledge so I jump down and rez them all. We then decide to try jumping our way around (None of us actually knew about the lava skip) and managed to make it to the MC entrance / forge where we finished the run and downed the emperor.
---
Well mate frankly I don’t really know what else I could tell you. I don’t do this in your gear or spec, you might just have to test it out for yourself and see if it works for you?
---
It will get worse. Probably 50min queues in AV after the casuals that can only play a little bit stop playing after rep grind
---
58 days 11 hours here.
---
We went 8 leafs in a row, so guess that evens it out.
---
To be as fair as possible, the gear that made them more viable isn’t until tier 2.5. But you aren’t wrong.
---
If sanctity aura was more useful you could use the Feral Druid/Boomkin argument a bit better
---
Now invite someone, make a portal, go through and then tell them to use it.
---
Ah, that adds up.  We have a discord, but never got a subreddit.
---
Alliance or Horde?
---
Ya yaaa yaaaah. only mages are worthy. the rest are pure crap. 35 mages and 5 dumb ass healbots huehue. dumb healers lel. 
---
yaaaaaah.
---
OEB is a great weapon 
---
imagine wielding a weapon with plus weapon skill of its own weapon type
---
Yea seems kinda weird.
---
Bull fucking shit. Horde only relies on alliance wanting to be done so they constantly pull this bullshit until alliance gets frustrated. It will change very soon when expectations are for hour long games and then this ain’t gonna work no more
---
Haha just messing bro, I main a Druid and have a Pally alt.
---
Bear MT outperforms warrior in current content. and will outperform uring BWL progression, until warrior tankss get full BWL gear at least.
---
I'm amazed none of the other warriors rolled against you
---
mewtwo*
---
youre just wrong
---
private servers (not all the same btw) literally worked different, where block wouldnt push crit off
---
another example is how weapon skill worked, where many private servers had a linear reduction in miss chance up until 310 wpn skill whereas in classic its linear to 307, then less to 308, then flatlines
---
As in the offhand can’t proc?
---
I disagree with your conclusion on the basis that there are people (like myself) that were waiting until bgs to do any kind of serious ranking
---
Feelsbad, I've never waited more than 10 seconds
---
Seems the options are either ally wins but horde gets 3k honor in 10 minutes, or horde wins after 30-40 min for 4k honor.
---
I think some of the most fun I've had is watching failed gankers. 
---
Generally when people gank me I just let them kill me as fast as possible so I can move on with whatever I'm doing. However, sometimes people just take too damn long to kill me and I decide I might as well run instead. I had one priest literally follow me from Tirion to LHC back all the way through both Plaguelands to Bulwark before he stopped chasing me. And then ofc there's all the mages that apparently haven't picked up Counterspell. I ended up killing a guy just by healing myself and interrupting his frostbolts.
---
Sorry, for clarity, the mod is WeakAuras2.
---
you need a LOT of pagle trinkets for naxx, so ZG will be on farm for awhile.
---
BWL and MC have plenty of BIS or BIS adjacent forever items for very popular classes (onslaught, BRE (until MoM), mind quickening gem(?), thunderfury, nelth's tear and many others i'm likely forgetting). ony will probably eventually be forgotten, but is still nice for deathbringers/viskags (she's a loot pinata already!). AQ 20 has a bunch of neat items too but i don't remember off the top of my head (i think there's a few really nice ranged weps there for melees and even hunters). 
---
yeah i don't expect our entire roster to pull through for MC like what we're doing now, but there are plenty of awesome items in all raids that don't become trivialized with new content.
---
I find it's much more about being frugal than about farming efficiently. I used to spend gold on all kinds of random crap like buying mid-level blues for alts that I'd use for a couple of days, or respeccing way too often. I'd spend 500+ on T1 wrists instead of waiting for them to drop. You don't have to do solo tribute runs or be an AH stockbroker to be financially comfortable.
---
On my shaman main, most of my farming has been done on totally standard mobs that don't drop anything unusual: level 58-60 undead mobs in the basement under Karazhan. There's never anyone there and the mob density is extremely high, so I can just put on a movie and grind until I get bored. Doing that for 4-5 hours once a week has made me something like 2k gold, half of which is the vendor loot and raw cash, the other half from stuff like a Maiden's Circle and a Dwarven Hand Cannon plus the vast piles of runecloth they drop.
---
ive made a portal, gone thru it, logged over to my alt, and taken my own portal  
---
as long as you don't leave group/raid,  others will be able to take your portal
---
&gt; They act peaceful when it suits them.
---
I mean that’s literally the best any race/faction/whatever tends to reach. Game or real life.
---
It's good that you use the internet to take out all that aggression. I bet in real life you would never speak like that to anyone. lol
---
Found the guild member.
---
pretty much! I havnt lost the last 8 or so games because of this (as opposed to the first few days where it was popping in under 10 mins and it was a win ratio of 1:10)
---
i mean hey if the guild wants to pay them to respec twice a week go for it lol
---
i heard someone in AV say that diminishing returns for HK's are lessened in bg's, so you can get honor for up to 10 kills, with each one being 10% less honor than the last.. is this true? or is it worthless after 5 like in wpvp?
---
We have an established officer core of over 15 people, class leaders, a raiding team, a ton of PvP people. Lots of levelling and lots of good times in our max roster guild. Guild chat is policed with just basic common sense and not being to vulgar, gross and definitely no attacking anyone.
---
 Settle your disputes in house, in tells, and don't make drama or you're out. Some big guilds just don't have the people to take care of shit. People ask for help and there's usually 10ish people in your level range.
---
I definitely wasn't sure about it at first, but it's been great.
---
I’m a healer who doesn’t raid and this happened to me before as well. Phase 3 specifically. Idk what causes the fears to happen but when you get feared into a fissure it hurts really bad. Fissure being the fire that spews out the cracks. I think it does like 1500 a tick. I wanted to see if it actually did damage to me it did (was at full hp with a fire protection potion) was randomly feared and walked back into another and died. Learned my lesson. Mess with the bull you get the horns lol. 
---
Phase three fear kills people. The end. At least that’s my experience.
---
We had 8 druids and 2 locks last run
---
Yeah no. Every single pro player for csgo/fortnite/siege/whatever uses a 24-25 inch 1080p monitor.
---
So much so that the groups I go with, most of the guys just skip the stuff
---
At this moment, this for sure.  Highest +damage due to the 2 piece bonus of 23 spell damage and the boots have 1% hit.
---
I'm not sure what you're smoking. Grobbulus is a dumpster fire of a server that has a completely unbalanced horde-alliance ratio. Even popular servers like Faerlina have a better experience than Grobbulus, which somehow manages to be both dead (you literally never see people out in the world even if you did care about RPing) as well as horribly unbalanced.
---
I don't know why anyone would ever roll on Grobbulus, and I feel bad for all the poor saps that are stuck on that server-- I rerolled off of it because of how terrible the experience is.
---
We all been there, bro.
---
I single handedly wiped over 300 people in everquest last year. I'm now running a raid guild in WoW.
---
What were some of those quirky oddities?
---
Be careful. With ranked PvP and the deserter debuff you’re gonna get the wrong person finally, and the shit will hit the fan. This is completely against the spirit of the game *and* griefing, so be prepared for a vacation if the wrong person makes a fuss.
---
It’s goddam hilarious though, lmao!
---
Asia
---
It's not the last boss
---
Kick ‘em
---
I’ve been putting in 19 + hours a day. Getting roughly 3-4 hours of sleep a night. It’s tough
---
Half my guild has been doing absolutely nothing but AV all day since BGs launched. The other half doesn't really PvP. I believe I'm the only one who has even set foot in WSG, since I play a spec that doesn't need rank gear and gets so little from AV rep that I haven't bothered with it yet. I've just been doing WSG for fun and because I eventually want to hit exalted somewhere down the road.
---
Most of my guildies who have been doing AV only did it to hit exalted. Most of them are doing it on two characters, but they're starting to be done with it lately so I feel like next week will see a massive drop in AV runs. Out of ~25 players who have been grinding AV all night for a week, I predict maybe 10 of them will keep doing it for honor after exalted.
---
Hopefully WSG will see more participation by then. Despite cross-realm BGs, I've been seeing the same opponents twice in a row on numerous occasions. AV gameplay is garbage, so for anyone who enjoys PvP but isn't trying to rank up, there should be no reason to keep doing it once the rep grind is done with. Fortunately the hardcore rankers will stay there and WSG won't have too many premades.
---
 I made no such claim.  In fact I explicitly said that I liked it and had no expectation that anyone else did.  His post was that it was always shit, full stop.
---
I heard its a dead server
---
Because that was not a standard practice.
---
I cried. How can I help???
---
Wait you have actual pvp in your AV’s? Must be nice
---
You are right!
---
I don't know what you think you're trying to make here, but it's wrong.
---
I could be the most skilled PVPer in the world, and if I only had an hour a day to play, I'd never  get past  rank 1.
---
Saurfang ICC :)
---
We have 2 prot warriors, the rest is fury. Obviously they ALL get tank gear. Why should they not? They priorize on dps gear, but every tank item which is not needed by the 2 prots is going to one of the furys. Ultimately gearing the warriors with defense gear is as fast as if they were prot. Makes no difference. There is only so much tank equip dropping and everything of it goes to a warrior, one way or another. 
---
Having too much prots cripples your raid dps, since warriors (and rogues) are THE damage dealers.
---
This all makes sense mathematically but you are treating this stuff like it's some trajectory to the moon instead of more like a very long range weather report. a LOT can change in the coming weeks and months.
---
The only thing that matters to actual players is the HONOR, which translate pretty directly into the amount of hours they must PVP each week. For any spot in the ranking brackets, that honor can be 2 million for R1... or 600K. with corresponding lower honor for lower brackets. The amount of honor depends on how many others are pushing hard (directly competing with you) on your faction, on your server. This number of "others" can and will change A LOT, sometimes rapidly. 
---
For the later ranks the difficulty (or the total honor required) has even more variables. R13/14 can become an insane grind even on the most optimal small faction, all it takes is another 15-20 man ranking clan suddenly popping up and your clan's weekly honor suddenly doubles if you want to stay with them. the reverse is also true when clans break up or (more common) work out honor cap deals with the others.
---
point is, it's not too predictable, and it's DEFINITELY not predictable from the weird Phase 2 data we have so far.
---
You're crazy.  Grobbulus is the worst realm out there.  Completely full of nazis and bots.  If you're thinking of rolling there you need your head examined.
---
I have a sneaking suspicion that you are a furry, /u/shameless_catslut
---
Tell me about this white glow enchant i havent seen anything about it
---
&gt;once some decent tps gear is out
---
..Then some decent fury gear will be out too. It'll only get worse.
---
I think that hardcore rankers will move to warsong premades if the queue for AV  continues to rise
---
Yes, all paladins should go down holy to consecration. Then you can go down the prot tree for the tanking blessing.
---
The song made this for me, I’m grinning from ear to ear.
---
This meme is dumb and ineffective.
---
I used to have only Bagnon, but the auto sort button glitched out once I bought a soul bag. This is when I found Adibags and was amazed. One of these addons that you never thought you needed, but now can't play without.
---
Had me in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
I don't disagree with your chart, just the conclusion. It doesn't take into account people like myself, but you do make a fair point
---
DB can hit like a truck in PvP - like, 1k+ overpower crits with high AP.
---
On Judgement EU there’s been some ranking drama. 
---
The leader of the top Alliance guild, Phoenix, is going for first r14. Some other players are pushing it as well, with one of these players snagging top honor one week. 
---
Turns out that this leader has been getting his guild cronies to consistently PM “hi” to these other contenders at all hours of the day. When the contenders respond, the Phoenix guild member goes silent.
---
On top of this, it also turns out he’s been getting them to mass report these players for account sharing, even though it’s fairly evident from their hours and general attitude towards it that they aren’t.
---
It’s great fun to keep up with on the discord. We all know what this guild is like and seeing these stories doesn’t really surprise the rest of the player base.
---
Deviate Delight
---
I'm glad people like you dont hinder pro players in various games. Why would you feel pity for someone that wants to do the grind? What if they are disabled, single, and cant work? Who are you to judge someone for how they spend their time.
---
Lol the queues are the *one* penalty the horde has had to their overpopulating 
---
if enough horde quit that the queues are gone and the factions are balanced, that sounds like a solution to me.
---
What's the difference of it having +hit?
---
Prot paladins can be good for 5 mans if they know what they are doing, but they are a no go for raids.  Personally, I would rather heal a feral tank in both raids AND 5 mans over any other type of tank.  Feral tanks are crazy underrated.
---
Redundant
---
I agree. There is also a fair amount of feral only gear(making them easy to gear up) and tanks aren't easy to find.
---
The only reason I can think to bring ret is if you absolutely can't find holy pallies.
---
I had one last night some went to Bal and we didn't wipe but we slowed them enough to get galv. Only game I won yesterday.
---
At least your GM didn't quit with all 3 thunderfury peices as well as the whole guild bank alt
---
In vanilla I hit rank 14 and incan attest to this. Those that were in that top percentile had agreed to an honor cap.
---
Reread the conclusion in 3 weeks when it applies to you.
---
i recently gave grobb a try on alliance, and so far i've seen a lot of great people, all having a really good time, not sure what brought you to this conclusion but i'm still low level so maybe i'll find out later
---
Dude never mind these TBC bunnies. I totally feel you.
---
Welcome to the first of many.
---
Here's the thing. Everyone makes mistakes, mostly when they're stressing out Abuut fucking up, or giving literally zero shits if they fuck up. Hell, this past week one of my guild healers managed the single most impressive whelp pull Ive ever personally been party to, damn near got swiped out the other side of the whelp cave, that sorta deep. We laughed it off cause it was funny.
---
Unless you join a raid/guild with stick up their ass syndrome theyre not gonna care.
---
Is a sword MH and dagger OH combo okay for hemo pvp builds?
---
*Laughs in Deviate Delight*
---
If you're gonna spend gold, make it last.
---
So if people worked together they could get rank 14 easier and more per week?
---
In theory you don’t need to give up life for r  14.
---
Thanks I’ve learned something new today :)
---
Playing wow or any game 18 hours a day for months isnt a good thing whatever your situation is. 
---
If you think that's an nonsense statement then I pity you also.
---
totally depends on if you can kill the three bosses along the way for drops.
---
might be as good as 25-30g /h
---
Why are warlocks allowed to exist
---
I think this is my top favorite weapon in the game.
---
Thanks for confirming. Do you ever sell it to pugs?
---
It's basically a better warmonger.
---
+skill reduces glancing blows in addition to reducing miss chance. So yea skill rating (to a point) is better than hit chance.
---
So in a theoretical situation, where many people stop farming honor because they’ve gotten exalted, would I move up in bracket that I’m currently at because the ones that aren’t farming are falling into lower brackets? I’m going for rank 10, but I made a big mistake by getting lazy after I hit exalted, and not farming wpvp first week, along with thanksgiving weekend aswell.
---
Priest/warlock is insane synergy. Rot and dot everything, spirit tap, life tap, renew, never stop to drink/heal. 2 shadow damage increasing debuffs. You can 2man every elite quest. And if you get bored of questing you both fit into spellcleave. 
---
Sure one might argue about gear competition but if you are leveling alts you might aswell buy ah greens. Dungeon blues really are not that big of a deal. And you could also just go out of your way and focus on the quests that have really good gear rewards, and you both get the benefit.
---
Horde side is no better. Bunch of edgelords and finding a group that knows what they're doing is next to impossible.
---
If you ever call them out "But it's muh RP!!"
---
It was pala, dunno, may be wanted rise price abit.
---
Most hemo builds will be pretty deep in the sub tree, and, by default, getting to the hemo talent will have you set up to use ambush very effectively.  
---
But you can’t ambush without a dagger in your main hand. 
---
Hemo rogues are typically dagger rogues.  But I’m a proponent of playing the game how you want.  Whatever floats your boat mate!
---
Eh, OP may be out to lunch but so are you. Not everyone thinks in min/max. 
---
Many of us roll horde because we don’t want to play humans and the most human like races in the game. Alliance in classic were boring that way. I want to be a giant cow or a zombie, not Bill and Jim.
---
Honestly unless you are Horde and giving it to a Shaman no one should really even want it.
---
Rag himself drops a weapon that is better and you don't have to farm a million gold in mats to get it.
---
It dropped for my guild on ally side and no one really wanted it since it would mean they wouldn't be getting bonereavers edge.
---
how can you be worse than 0 alliance?
---
And by then I guess its useless?
---
It's cool RPing a little while you play the actual game. You know, not yelling about politics in /1 (unless it's the Barrens of course) and stuff. 
---
But trying to be a pervert in Goldshire, or just running around as a low level for "the role playing emmersion"...oof.
---
Because it will last longer. Maiden's band is replaceable with the honored ring from WSG, which ought to be available p3. MC and Ony are a joke, no need to spend crazy gold unless it's going to last longer. So yeah, twice the gold for twice the usage makes sense. 350g for a mediocre prebis doesn't.
---
sure theyre not just vanishing ur root?
---
Their AoE threat is nice for some trash and bosses like Nefarian, also really nice in areas like the suppression room, AQ tunnel and Heigan gauntlet. They *can* tank bosses that doesn't need a taunt rotation, it's not very optimal though and don't forget that the huge majority of bosses in vanilla are immune to taunt. With bosses so far hitting like wet noodles only the threat matters and that's not something a prot paladin does very well, on single target anyways.
---
1. Because the grind is insane and requires an 18+ hour commitment for 3 months or more.
---
2. Because even people who do that will probably still fail.
---
3. Because most rank 14s do not enjoy the grind at all.
---
4. Because most rank 14s quit the game after reaching it, or reroll.
---
5. Because no matter your circumstances there are an endless list of things you could dedicate 18 hours a day to that aren’t particularly enjoyable but will vastly improve your life and prospects.
---
I’m not judging someone doing the grind, but I am absolutely feeling pity for them. It’s a miserable experience they won’t enjoy and will probably fail for rewards that aren’t worth it and that they likely won’t end up using.
---
I don’t give a shit how “no changes” vanilla was supposed to be, this grind should have stayed dead.
---
Can we talk about Broccoli edging out Shabz by ONE yeesh
---
Your post is as much a rant as his, which is why I said it was stupid. Saying “horde and alliance” as though it isn’t a few vocal people while the rest of us enjoy the game. 
---
Horde has always had queues, since 2007. I played then and I’m not surprised now. But its certainly nothing new. nobody, horde or alliance could lvl on my server during phase 2 launch. OP clearly didn’t play back then. They queues were much longer than 20 minutes. 
---
Horde has been the higher pop since launch of classic. I expect that to always be the case until the game ends. 
---
My solution would be to not make the alliance races so generic from the get-go 15 years ago.
---
It will either be the RP or PVP aspect of the community.
---
Returned to sender, where they have 30 days to retrieve or it is gone for good.
---
Man that's so weird because I thought you were cancelling your WoW subscription like you said in that Hearthstone thread.
---
I find it funny that people can exploit guards via bad game mechanics (not even talking about the LOS rooftop stuff) but when someone does something like this which is clearly easy to do is "suspendable". How is this different than someone being feared into the portal?
---
I’m a man with wiener and 2 feet.
---
I know isn't it sad when people have nothing better to do than bring up old stuff? Must have a pathetic life.
---
Dude... Are you ok?
---
Brexit Classic
---
Let's see how that works out for them when it gets closer to rank 14. 
---
That aside, "10-12h/day"? Still insane. Needing to do more than that to take a day off? Insane.
---
Everything I said still applies, and using people from APES etc as examples is *really* not selling it being anything but a terrible idea.
---
quebec has entered the chat
---
Your guildie was botting at work.
---
only 640g if you get exalted with AV
---
Pvp as 5. Running at a solo leveler. He dings 60 as we close in to kill him. 
---
We all /grats him then kill him.
---
I’m concerned that you have more than ZERO Ret Pallies in your raid.
---
right elf hunter!
---
Or when they're fucking spineless and jump on the bandwagon of shitting on a thing that they're actually obsessed with lol get the fuck outta here.
---
No doubt. It just shifts from one complaint to another. 
---
Prime example
---
Vocal Minority: We need bgs! Literally unplayable
---
Blizzard: Gives AV &amp; WSG early
---
Vocal Minority: BUT THIS ISNT THE VERSION OF THE BG WE WANTED!!!
---
pretty much.  I mean you still use fire pots for vael but its very optional at that point.
---
People change their mind all the time, except you are still here, talking about me, because you are pathetic. fuck out of here.
---
I run viskag/kris when I spec hemo. I like the 10 stam/agi. Imo, oh weapons are only there to proc poisons and give stats in a hemo build. I had crusader on it, but put a weapon chain on it after losing a close 1v1 with a warrior in wpvp because of disarm. It was so rare that I got a good/fun 1v1 during p2 that it pissed me off enough to overwrite crusader. I don't know if this is a good idea overall though.
---
That only works as long as randoms don't push Bracket 13-14. If they're uncontested at 1,200,000 honor, they will stop there. If 2-3 randoms decide to push 2,000,000 honor, everyone in Bracket 13-14 will suddenly push for 2,200,000 honor too.
---
Damn. So I should have made my exalted push in a couple weeks? Because right now I'm basically running on an honor treadmill?
---
“I think I’ll be rank 10, have 300,000 honor!”  
---
  
---
Yeah, and so does EVERYONE ELSE, at least.
---
It doesn’t work when you make it so blatantly over the top like that.
---
Lol embarrassing
---
Sounds like this Is the server to move to, boys.
---
I went from 0 to 3 with like 10k honor the first week. Staying at 3 takes even less. As long as you don't actively avoid PvP, you're almost guaranteed to make enough honor.
---
Outside of TB on Whitemane, all of the cats there are dead too just like the OP.
---
Minecraft...?
---
Get a life loser.
---
You think you do...
---
Bruh
---
Deviate Delight FTW
---
I really do regret rolling on grobb, god what a shitty server
---
Lololol
---
Literally
---
its fun until youve killed the same dumb mage whos just keeps blinking in and using frost nova and arcane explosion 19 times
---
Not really sure what you’re asking, but you could simply upload your classic&gt;interface&gt;addons folder to google drive or something and provide the link in the description, then go over each addon and what they do individually in the video
---
Trannies is an offensive slur, you monster!
---
Escape button untargets so it’s already there

Before you get too excited, read up on the tragedy of the commons.

---
Happened in one of my guilds on Spirestone, but it was not like a universal
---
Mara is better gold than lashers for sure even if you don't sell rings. When Ghost Mushroom prices are high sometimes I'll start from orange side and grab 3-5 of them per reset without going below 5 lockouts per hour.
---
He eventually paid people back. He just recently sent half the gold back to the last person he owed. It may be 2.5 months later, but he's doing it.
---
Judging by retail pre sharding, it will most likely stay the same. There will be one realm that is balanced, couple completely lopsided, and most will stay at 1:2 imbalance. It might get worse with classic since a lot of content is in the world and the weaker faction will have harder time doing stuff routinely.
---
I myself started on a PvP server as Alliance with a friend, to relive the old days, but it was ruined by imbalance. I realized that I maybe had two or three good experiences, and the rest was just annoying. Now that my friend barely plays, and I realized that I myself barely  play because I limit myself due to world PvP, I came to conclusion that it might just be better to switch to my PvE realm alt for good.
---
I thought BGs would make it better, and while it does eliminate honor canola camps, imbalance still sucks.
---
I considered rerolling to a balanced PvP realm, but I don't want to risk for a slightly better experience while still dealing with world PvP.
---
Now, PvE server has its own disadvantages. Everything is a little bit less valuable, because you can easily farm without danger. For example, some tactical potions like swiftness are way cheaper on a PvE realm. Some pvp oriented talents suddenly lose value during leveling. Etc.  There's a little less achievement in everything. But again you need to stay honest to yourself - do you actually enjoy world PvP or you just want to enjoy it?
---
But I think overall, if you don't have friendly gank squad, if you don't always want to PvP, PvE realm is the way to go.
---
There is zero doubt in that. There is not a morally good civilization among the races of azeroth even though its a high fantasy story. 
---
The distinction we are making here, or really were trying to flush out was just how not different / very different the scourge is from the forsaken. And personally aside from location and leader gender there isn't a difference.
---
Definitely a dick move. I wouldn’t put you on ignore, but I would tell you to learn how portals work. It’s annoying to group with mages who leave group and fuck you on portal.
---
China my friend.
---
get a swingtimer addon/weakaura
---
I might be able to help. So yes it can be inconvenient for it not being separate monitors that you can have multiple things on, but as for fully immersing yourself into WoW it can be perfect. There is a slight bend to the screen so you don’t get sick from the motions because it’s more shaped like your eyes. It is actually a great monitor especially for RP players
---
Wait, not everyone is a neckbeard?
---
That's awesome!! Good idea!!
---
&gt; but leaving urself without that shield leaves u extremely vulnerable when u could be unkillable
---
and leaving yourself without an interupt and cleanse does the same thing.
---
You cant beat a good ol fashion zug tug
---
It's only the 16th!
---
to please
---
Traditionally, people almost never do that. It could happen, but so far it hasn't seemed like the PvP community behaves particularly different in Classic than it has in the past. Nobody gains anything from breaking the bracket, and anyone able to grind that amount of honor is part of a PvP community that will hate their guts if they do it.
---
At least one....
---
Paladins can't wear daggers btw
---
Least we win our games, even if it takes as long as the que haha
---
Alliance still going strong. Still has some pretty big raiding guilds. Shouts out to Vanilla!
---
Playing on grobb, from my experience, the extent of rp 95% of people do is having an actual name for their character. Can confirm low player skill.
---
Coordinating a bunch of people has nothing to do with individual PVP skill.
---
Thats because its not a thing, the glow is on a crafted weapon
---
Hmmm that I'm not too sure, other than just using the URL. Maybe if there is a share tab? I can't remember
---
Smart rogue, smart boomkin. Shame Alliance would never think of that.
---
Some RP is fine man if it's true to the game and not weird ERP/furry shit. There is a difference between RP and mental illness. If you think RP is all stupid, then anyone who plays DnD is pathetic, along with many other things people consider fun and is relatively normal.
---
jesus.. in less then a month? My eyes melted just thinking about that
---
The Ony attunement dragons is a quest that has to be done ONCE.  of course it will be always be relatively hard to get a group for that, compared to a raid which is farmed.
---
I play on Alliance and it's not bad. It's still probably skews more towards horde, but out in the world I see about as much Ally as Horde.
---
A whole raid easily does 1k+ per person, and several k dps on larger pulls per person.
---
You're not allowed to have fun in BG's apparently
---
Exactly. If you have someone keeping you alive you just have carte blanche to do what you please. Even Boomkins. lol
---
Eh even at 3.00 speed, if you get that at lvl 47 as human, it would be great.
---
idk man when I fight against people from rp servers I really enjoy the game
---
You would have to be pretty fucking brain dead to get any enjoyment from wow PVP lmao.
---
so i'm not crazy, you've seen them too? :D
---
Highest honor per hour?
---
Just how much better is +shadow damage for warlocks than int/spirit while leveling? I have the choice between +3 shadow damage or 7 int and 7 spirit. Currently level 41 if that matters.
---
How does it work in league? It doesn't let you see more of the rift right? That would be a huge advantage. If it doesn't then how is it different from a normal screen?
---
The rep grind doesn’t take a week lmao.
---
Intentions with mind control are very clear, fear can be argued as a mistake
---
I'm with you.
---
./yawn and who the fuck cares about PvP ranks?
---
Same
---
This meme is factual and true.
---

---
my wife's boyfriend got me one for December Holidays too!

also haha nice mountain dew bud, too bad it isnt code red ;)
---
You take that back you slimy git!
---
Oh my he mightve been right. Man's a prophet.
---
I thought i did but now im confused as to what i actualy want
---
Haha, yeah, but I mean after 20 what is 10 years of age. I'm sure you'd fit right in if you were enjoying the content.
---
As a tank bear druid, I often do this as well to draw people clicking to attack me.
---
I'm not saying they had better data at all, not sure where you're coming up with that but if I didn't explicitly state so, here it is. In fact, I did already say private servers had stuff wrong too. What I'm saying is that these private servers still did a better job at making a true vanilla experience compared to Classic.
---
People that want the gear from PvP ranks, or hell people that like PvP.
---
You're right, we should all mindlessly grind honor and rep to get the best items so that we can do that all again when the next wave of content hits. That's how you have real fun.
---
Also reduces dodge and parry (not that this matters as much) and increases crit chances!
---
Weapon skills op (diminishes hard after 7 tho)
---
A ret pally will push a button every 6 or so seconds

with rhok'delar they clip their rotation, meaning they don't time anything, just hit it when it's up.

Light Balance got a furbolg?
---
Yeah, I'm confident this is the correct diagnosis. Thanks for writing it up eloquently!
---
Currently in bracket 11, aiming for r10. 
---
Seems like I can cut a bit slack and enjoy christmas.
---
I got gave up about knowing about ranking but HonorSpy is kind enough to tell me If I need to work more or less.
---
If you're actually Matt Damon then sure
---
Your rank won’t move until the weekly update tomorrow, unless you are talking about what HonorSpy projects you at?
---
Ive gotten 46k this week and honorspy says I'm not going to go from rank 2 to 3
---
With the advent of small scale PvP (2v2, 3v3, and 5v5), individual class differences were amplified and balance was much more delicate, and Blizzard began to chase the ever impossible goal of 100% balance between all classes (which resulted in the mass homogenization we see today). The meta would be found very quickly, and anyone outside of that would get rolled.
---
For attunements, TBC attunements were a much bigger scale than Vanilla ones so I'm not sure what you're trying to say. There were attunements for basically every single raid, that spanned across many, many quests and pretty much every single heroic dungeon. Not to mention, early on, only 5 people per raid could loot the Vial fragments to get attuned to Hyjal, which was a requirement to attune to Black Temple. But to even get into the Eye for one of the  fragments, you needed Magtheridon, which had his own comprehensive attunement etc.
---
it doesnt proc either mh or off
---
It would probably have to be a yikes from me boys
---
ITT: I cant tell if they hate it or love it...
---
Isn't one piece of rank 14 armor bis lol
---
Yeah pvp server would be stupid IMO. There's literally nothing you could do other than level in dungeons, even then you're likely to get ganked by a BIS 60.
---
I mean, I know vanish is buggy sometimes but I can't understand this post.  
---
I'm not a diehard, but I play my fair share and I play rogue. I use vanish a lot - I have preparation, so more encounters than usual off of using that vanish. I probably vanish upwards of 50 times a day. And if I had to put a number to it, I'd say 1/50 vanishes fails. I just don't see how a quarter of your vanishes fail unless you are using it while dotted, bleeding, or in direct aggro range and detected by a mob. It's seriously one of the most cheat code moves in the game.
---
PVP would literally be impossible. I will donate $100USD to anyone with a 1-60 recording on a pvp server where they don't level in dungeons from 43+.
---
98% of the player base isn’t even looking at the bitching, they’re just loving it.
---
Adapt? I personally like the 12 minute queue for AV. It lets me get other things done, while not falling behind in the honor grind. Maybe it's hard for a warrior, but mages have so many options. For example I set my hearthstone to gadgetzan and now I can get a full clear of ZF in while waiting for AV to start.
---
It is extremely unlikely that 30 hours of PvP a week will ever get you high enough in the weekly standings to reach R12.
---
Those 10+ hr games were back in the days before we knew we could just run past the other faction and base race. I’m pretty sure Al Gore invented that in 2006, but I might be wrong about the timing.
---
Thanks so much for this! Turned on WoW and was getting 20-30fps on classic, did your fix and am now over 100 with max settings.
---
Id do the troll bit if I wasn't married and full time employed.
---
Most of the r14 guys are so toxic that trolling them would be an all time great troll event.
---
Oh yeah. Definitely seen that happen multiple times.
---
You're comparing a leveling weapon to a raid weapon?
---
What about iceblade hacker/frostbite vs frostbite/bsh
---
Yup
---
This may strike close to home, but you remind of the kid in middle school who would come bumbling up to a group of people having a good time /cracking jokes then ruin the joke.
---
First you get the hammer. Then you get the power. Then you get the women.
---
I auto ignore anyone who sends me a spam invite who I don't know. It's super obnoxious, and most of these people are from leveling guilds.
---
Yes.  
---
    
---
The increased competition only makes it more of an achievement. It still takes an incredible amount of commitment.
---
Only downside to my server is ally has a bunch of nazis, but they are bad so easy to farm em in wpvp
---
Seems like favoritism to me, if my guild told me they would rather sell ingots, which I was in the raid for and worked towards like any other loot, I would be pretty pissy, even if I didn’t need the hammer. 
---
Now ingots beyond what has dropped? On their own.
---
I've played AV for about 4 hours this week. When can I expect my PvP mount?
---
I don't really understand the difference between regular and rp servers. Like I understand what roleplay is and what it means, I mean I've played DnD, but when it comes to WoW I don't really understand what's different I guess. Idk it's hard to describe
---
I'd be right happy to!
---
Only the horde one, the ally version looks like pure garbage.
---
I reported four mid 40s horde players last night in Feralas for this. 
---
   
---
Always Hunter or Mage, although lately they’re usually hunters.  Troll. Boar pet, pet name is either a single Chinese character or random garbage English key presses like fdfdfdfhh.  
---
Target mob. Attack mob.  Loot mob. Wander in a random direction for 2 seconds. Repeat.  
---
No response to whispers. 
---
 
---
No response to party invite. 
---
No response to emotes. 
---
No response to you repeatedly jumping their targets before they tap them.  
---
They always appear around midnight or 1 AM server time and spend hours mindlessly killing bears, wolves or yetis through the night.  
---
The most frustrating thing is the feeling that your reporting them does nothing, that Blizzard is doing the bare minimum to keep Classic going and has checked out of life on customer service.  
---
Back in Vanilla I had a GM appear in game to fix a bugged raid boss and again in Burning Crusade to chat with me about a cheating player I had reported.  Both times, GM in game in their avatar. Five minute chat.  
---
You get absolutely no feedback now, no sense that any human being has received and is looking at your concern - not even a canned in game mail that would take a CSR ten seconds to send.
---
Don’t forget the strength of earth totem as well.
---
Got you /u/MrPeakyBicepsMan !
---
The biggest difference between vanilla and classic is that servers never used to be cross-realm until a lot later, so I’m sure getting there was insanely harder but you probably had more pathways to get there like WSG and AB.
---
I think it’s an achievement still because you have to be very dedicated but yea you also have to have not much else to do...
---
I personally wouldn't mind that. That buff is still quite a lot of damage bonus.

When the queue dialog box pops up, use the BG minimap icon and click “enter battle” instead
---
Pre-BG was rough, groups of 4-10 horde at Throium Point/Morgan's Vigil/Lights Hope/Chillwind/boats. I spent as much time corpse running as I did playing in dungeons. Several of the top guilds transferred servers, leaving us even more outnumbered.
---
Now that the BG are out, you must do AV to compete for Honor, so it's been better; was able to run from TP to BRD without seeing one horde.
---
It's easy enough to find instance groups still. Many people are just raid logging or dedicated to BGs so there aren't as many groups out there going, but you can still find what you're looking for within 20min or so.
---
In terms of the hit stats it provides... Yes.
---
3% rating is equivalent to the +8 two handed sword skill that OEB gives. 
---
Is this hard to understand?
---
Less than a week
---
Yes, because it is in no way like a warmonger.
---
It just has 3 hit. You don't need to compare it to a weapon that isn't anything like it.
---
Yeah, how dare you stand in any spot on your mount in the game.
---
this might be a dumb question but why can't horde premade but ally can? I'm not high enough level yet to even do AV lol
---
Genius. Ahahah
---
Came just to say the same thing and I find it's already here.
---
If you ar enot aware and read a great post on this earlier. You are very unlikely to get to Rank 10 which si the gear, you are far more better to get the Rep and items done that way. 
---
Best honour for horde is probably to rush belinda and lts and lose with 3k honour in about 7-10 mins. Best rep is to win by putting up some Defence at belinda (mages) who then TP to def drek. This is probably a 12-15 min game (sometimes a bit more) and gets 4-5k hnour and much more rep.
---
The people who will hit rank 10 are almost solely the people who have absolutely no lifed it and already planned what they need to do. It is a bit of a reality shock, im doing quite a lot of pvp but unlikely to get to Rank 8 whilst I have a job.
---
I don’t believe it’s mathematically possible to go from 6.75 to 14 in 7 weeks even as Standing 1.
---
Just rolled on bloodsail buccaneers. Should I be worried at all?
---
Nah some Warrior won it
---
&gt; songflower being shareable
---
Songflowers as they are currently in Classic is a bug. It is part of the list of known issues, as was posted [here]. they'll be shareable eventually, hopefully before Naxx releases.
---
There were no such thing as speed grinders 15 years ago? There were mechanics to prevent what didn't exist? Not following m8.
---
Hes being sarcastic, I think.
---
But only horde side.
---
Nice.
---
Yikes
---
There are some very obvious signs of a bot that are more fool proof than this. They will sometimes get caught running on obvious little terrain snags and be starting and stopping and jumping instead of walking 5 feet in another direction to get around it. I've seen a bot stuck on a little glitch in the ground in azshara for several minutes. I often see the mages drinking after every mob they kill, even though they have 80% mana and full hp. I saw a lvl 58 warrior grinding level 47ish mobs for no experience. He'd been there for 2 days straight afaik and just didn't bother to move or logout.
---
Wow good to know it’s not always accurate. Seems to be working in my server (Old Blanchy). I’ve seen some of the top players around
---
Ours is selling off ours for flasks, hand of rag isn’t that great nor helpful to the raid
---
&gt; That's what people tell themselves, so they don't have to think that they are lesss skilled than the players with more stuff.
---
LOL, talking about skill in Classic. That's like saying "I can put on my velcro sneakers better than you can!", it's adorable honestly.
---
Stay out, deadbeat. Keep your ugly fucking goldbricking ass out of my beach community.

There are lost of guilds that have cleared mc

---
On a more optimistic note - check if your server has fixed brackets. If they do, chances are the honorgrind is a lot friendlier. For example on Firemaw (A) BR14 (or BR1 as it's more commonly refered to) is at 1.6mill right now. This is About 11.5hours a day/7 at 20k H/h. But most asume this will go furter down as first week of AV is verye exciting to people and they play much more than they would.
---
BR3 on the same server is 1million atm, which is just above 7h/day/7 - Not unheard of
---
Or R/G colorblind
---
The odds of winning a roll off in a 5 man group is 1 in 5.
---
But to win a roll off in a 40 man raid you need to take the sum of all the players, divided by 100 x the time of day UTC. and add on your Level
---
This gives you x.
---
Now you need to take x and multiply it by 77 to get your chosen card. which if Im correct, was the 2 of diamonds.
---
Right.
---
I'm turning 30 next year, I'm still use to the tiny mice with the larger keyboards. Like damn, I miss my large white keyboards those were the best. I'm going to try out the alt key but if that doesn't work then I'll try out the MMO mouse, thanks.
---
Alright I came back to give you credit that maiden's is better than I thought,being 18 sp when I was thinking 14. Still. Bang for buck not worth imo
---
Why on earth would you take improved demoralizing Shout over unbridled Wrath?
---
I'll give you that TB is a superior city for a trade alt. The only things that lets it down a bit is its location for current endgame content.
---
TB is beautiful tho.
---
&gt;my point is you will be running MC for the next 6 months and will see it again.
---
If you read my original post I said I've only seen 2 in 3 months of raiding. So 4 in the next 6 months? There's an average of 6-9 DPS warriors in guilds. So if you give one of those belts to a Paladin all you do is screw over your Warriors... They might not see that belt until f***ing AQ40.
---
My point still stands.
---
yeah I was incorrect about that. I thought there was enchant that was just cosmetic but I think it is just a retail thing. Sorry about.
---
Name checks out
---
In that case, Grobbulus has about 100 guilds with MC on farm
---
(it's why they chose near irrelevant examples)
---
The fact you separated paladins and healers offends me.
---
Baby Yoda for sure. Did you see the baby Yoda I made or was this completely random lol?
---
Both swords
---
Both 2 handers 
---
Both give roughly the same amount of pure hit.
---
Why is this so difficult you?
---
What other 2 handed swords is there to compare it to? No others have hit/ weapon skill like it. 
---
So OEB is exactly a better warmonger.
---
usually by time they pull drek its too late to stop in my experience , unless every one recalls and pushes in at once..rarely happens due to lack of coordination
---
Last time we did Molten Core someone had living bomb on Baron Geddon but was afk, wiped half the raid instantly. We still cleared it, ressed and buffed up and it was fine (it still would've been fine for us, these things happen sometimes). As long as it doesn't cause a total wipe, you're usually good unless the raid team are tryhards or just generally arseholes.
---
Oh wow, that is quite the interesting design for a mouse. Now that I think about it I haven't really looked into the MMO mice since like 2008... Damn I'm getting old /cry. But yeah, good to know for the chance to hit, thanks.
---
LMAO.

Or he realizes how big of a waste it is

I just got a spinal reaper as a paladin yesterday!

Helpful calculator for those interested in ranking and want to see what kind of numbers you're looking at to hit desired rank!
---
"Main-Hand"
---
I can't un-see the tooth exactly in the center of his mouth.
---
I can barely read what you are saying.   But I will say that fast games lose value as queue times increase.  
---
Example, 
---
You get 3k honor in 10 mins, or 5k in 15 mins.  Queue time is 15 mins.  
---
The 10 min game yields 3k honor/25 mins = 120 honor/min.
---
The 15 min game yields 5k honor/30 min = 166.666 honor/min.
---
I dont see why anyone would even want rank 10. 80 hours a week for a blue set?  Surely getting 8/8 tier 2 is easier and probably better anyway?
---
High pop servers are not a real classic experience, I wanted some low pop stuff so building a community is more fun
---
Against the spirit of the game lol? Dude did you play vanilla?
---
Change it to what though?
---
The later honor system was just AFKing in AV until you got enough honor for your gear pieces.
---
Woah the part about only 2 guilds reaching rag is very, very wrong. People on grob had killed rag like a week after MC was out. But yeah it’s a pretty cancer server
---
It was always who put in the most time even in vanilla
---
Only favors if the horde do nothing to turtle, Alliance win Zerg v Zerg. Horde win if they put up any resistance, because you can backdoor Dun Baldur.
---
we don't allow meme specs but seriously it doesn't matter 1 to a ret pally isn't going to make or break your progression. people really need to just let it go and enjoy the game
---
That's why I always always kill hunter pets
---
Hey I feel violated. Been tanking every MC as Prot for months now.
---
Nah man, he’s gonna get his honor in AB right now ;)
---
I'd suggest doing the math backwards after pvping for 3 weeks. Don't bother with honorspy unless you're pvping more than 60 hours a week.
---
I recently leveled my hunter and found [this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlb-POUbv8Y) really helpful! Good luck :)
---
&gt; individual PVP skill.
---
Nobody said anything about "individual" skill. No pvp system by Blizzard has ever focused on that.
---
You only thought "Grand Marshal" was cool back in the day because you were 12. It required the same no life grinding then that it will now.
---
これ！！！！
---
I had someone earlier tell me they're going to get to rank 8 from rank 3 this week. I didn't really want to explain to them it's impossible to jump 5 ranks like that.
---
Yeah, I think I might try out the MMO mice and stop being so stubborn about it. Unfortunately, stubbornness comes with age and I've been using my $5 tiny Logitech mice with just the regular 3 buttons since my first desktop back in 2004 or 2005. I have tried probably a dozen or so different makes or models since then but I seem to keep going back to the $5 ones you find in the basket...
---
???? In what fight. Half the people there are unbuffed. You are a melee and dont even come close to anyone
---
Horde actually got fucking steamrolled for that kazzak kill. Horde dominated server btw
---
&gt; Turns out WoW players dont actually want PVP they just want to be rewarded.
---
Ghostcrawler once said people choose efficiency over fun. Its the designers job to align the two.
---
WSG and AB do this somewhat well. AV does not.
---
We've gotten 4 OEBs in the last 2 weeks.
---
Of course I am.  Me and Ben Affleck ready to premade this up =P
---
We've had 0 eye, 0 bre, 0 core hound tooth, 0 brutality blade, but 3 thunderfury bindings. Our guild has some weird rng.
---
No, Orc is still god race lmao
---
Based on census numbers, *a lot* of alliance seem to be jumping ship. The faction balanced has flipped completely in the past month.
---
Search. Tons and tons and tons of other posts already. Thanks.

i'm surprised this actually works.

Reactive gameplay, feels like I'm operating a fine machine responding to the situation instead of lightning bolt spam. Also the class fantays is appealing to me, charging in and crashing around wrecking shit.

Also Mana fucking sucks

"Bitch, better have my black lotus next time!"
---
Sorry rushed at work - yes agree queue times affect it enormously. I was essentially saying the only reason to worry about honour is for the rank 10 gear which will be almost impossible for you to do - everyone thinks this will be easy and so I am saying focus on the rep - guaranteed av items (depending on class). 
---
I personally want to pvp a lot but also want to enjoy it and my eu pvp q times for av are 10 mins minimum atm so better to have a good AV than quick imo but have not run the maths. Turn in for 3 av marks each time also a big benefit in rep and hnr
---
i am geting boosted in sfk by 60 mage,at which lvl should we move to sm ?
---
Yeah trying to compete for rank right now is stuuuupid. Gotta wait for everyone to spread out/get bored.
---
There are other things that are easier to grind right now.
---
Higher dps should have gotten it. Better players deserve the gear.
---
No graphic update for warsong, but redesign AV.
---
I think they roll a dice what they do or not.
---
ah, should have rolled horde, that white wolf is nice
---
I mean my guild all quit because it took us an hour to get into bed from thorium point for two weeks. It just wasn't worth the time. The remaining rogues and mages have been fucking around in av having a grand old time but out healers and tanks have all rerolled rogue. Including me.
---
Depression in a post
---
Whole guilds left Bleum during the free transfer portion. The horror stories of the alliance I have heard would lead me to say no, it is not anywhere near 50/50
---
Yes it does... All spellcasting speed reduction talents do. Frostbolt is calculated at a 3.0 out of 3.5 coefficient. When you take the talent, your cast speed goes down to 2.5, but you keep your 3.0 coefficient.
---
Good, all the alliance in the disc pvp channels were pure, unbridled 11yo cancer.
---
Long answer: noooooo
---
This jump is easier.  I always see people getting stuck at the other one.
---
Can attest, was asked to commit suicide after being asked to solo tank ubrs as fury spec then fail to clear last boss
---
Okay, but some kids can indeed put their velcro sneakers on better than others, right
---
My debate was between the Dreamweave and shadoweave chests lol
---
sad for you

Cool to hear another perspective!

I did see some very large alliance squads rolling around together, but I don’t remember them controlling objectives for a long time. Thanks for sharing your PoV though!

The last Walmart guild I was in, there was a guy holding a grudge for several days in chat against another member that had supposedly ninja'd an item in Deadmines. I eventually had to tell him that even if it was true, he'd be better off forgetting about it because he was making himself extremely unlikeable over it.
---
hope so, can't tell now a days, seems like everyone hates the game and it's communities...
---
Funny you say this, because the median hunter does about 15% more dps than the median fury warrior.
---
Warriors have a much higher skill ceiling(for their tanks as well well as themselves), but they aren't that amazing for the typical raider.

There's not a lot of skill involved in Classic at all. It's all guides and grinds. I see constant conga lines of Undead Rogues with Engineering who think they're good. Nothing about that is skill. They're broken and fool themselves into thinking they're good.
---
Sure, there's SOME skill but it's a lot more like you either know how to play your class or you don't.
---
Yeah it’s good for a ballpark estimate tho
---
You don't need "group skill" to rank up.  You just need time.  Stop trying to pretend that the honor system was all about skill.
---
From what I understand is swords if you're leveling solo, daggers for pvp or group play.
---
Rogues can't properly make use of their dagger talents in solo pve becasue the mob is never facing away from you.
---
Grob has honestly been pretty shit lately.
---
How do you get your class portraits to have the elite border with the dark outline with classportraitsfinal?
---
these are vendor items... and mana pots/health pots don't deviate that much
---
Just depends what you need. As a lock with a staff of dominance I have literally no need for AV until everyone else has their shadow dagger/mageblade
---
I quit classic after waiting for weeks for BGs to revitalize Deviate Delight only to get home from work and find out the strategy for classic AV is to immediately rush the boss and if you cant get him down in 1 attempt, to stop playing and wait for the horde to win while simultaneously accusing people who want to at least give it another go of "turtling."
---
Can you get shadowplay without the awful GeForce Experience software? I hate that shit so much
---
Been doing this for a while. So many stuck up mages who don’t just immediately know what it means. My success rate for this method is about 35%
---
World chat on my server is always dead. Green guild chat is more active. I wish there was more world chat
---
Just like now it requires skill in finding a team and the politics of who will be rank 14 which week, but that is all that is necessary. I should know, I got r13 and I'm total trash. We just farmed pugs like crazy.
---
Hello it's me, your future self
---
28 39 12 2 16 17 22
---
Added 2 sheets with my tables.
---
Even more so because a lot of players are spending 2hrs+ in AV killing the same 30 or so players the whole time. I know that DR on honor isn't as bad in BGs, but they're still losing out on honor by turtling for hours fighting the same 30 players while the other 10 are people entering and /afking out immediately.

Ok, unbuffed I have 3027 hp, 5076 mana, 171 stam, 252 int, 208 spirit, 547 +healing, and 31mp/5
---
Like them arcane Crystals. Silithus is empty all the time now.
---
I saw this too. Why don’t they want new people? Do a small group of people have control of it and want it to stay that way or something?
---
I've had prot pallies who have aggro issues, better for aoe sure but single target i need to hold back now that i'm geared.
---
Me too but I rerolled. I'll sell the small balanced skirmishes I like in arena since it's unicorn rare in classic.
---
Essentially, your ranking will be depressed this week unless you are ahead of the exalted earners.  But in the coming weeks, if you are grinding hard, you'll get a boost as the majority of exalted slack off and play less.  Specifically referring to those that came back for BGs or started pvping because of BGs.
---
Projecting.
---
Doh. Autocorrect.
---
Brd
---
They think they do but they dont
---
Same. Being a tank in AV is really enjoyable.
---
I tanked Yesterday the icelord an we realy managed to kill it in our Base Feeled amazing
---
This last 4.5k until exalted is killing me.
---
dont be mad at me cus he killed the joke D:
---
but its cross realm so the top honor grinders can just solo queue in a AV and make more than a premade does in a wsg for the most part.
---
Naughty
---
If you're not hardcore don't worry about honor until at least after next summer. You will not compete with the people getting rank 14.
---
After all of them get it, you'll have an easier time gettink rank 10+ I got it playing only a few hours a day in Vanilla, but this was several months after we had dozens of HWL warriors running around.
---
I played WoW way back in 2006 with my brother when I was only 14 and my brother 10. We had been talking about playing WoW Classic for a while but never committed. We finally started playing again last month and completely lost ourselves in nostalgia. We also convinced our significant others to start playing, our cousin, and my soon to be brother-in-law. Fast-forward a few weeks and we are running our first dungeon through Wailing Caverns, during the run Keller's Girdle drops. Having been a slight veteran of WoW I told everyone that we should sell it on the AH and split the profit since it was a 19 twink belt.
---
Well I was in charge of selling it on the AH and...I made a mistake. I accidentally put it up for 20**s** instead of 20**g**. So the first thing I did was send a letter to the person who bought the belt and include the 20s to see if I could possibly buy back the belt. But I didn't hear anything back for a few days, so I also sent in a ticket to Blizzard. Unfortunately Blizzard told me that they are "extremely hands off when it comes to the Auction House". I understood, so I marked the ticket as resolved and sucked up my mistake. A few days later we ran Wailing Caverns again and  I broke the bad news to all our friends and family, that unfortunately, they were only going to get 4s as part of their split.
---
We finished Wailing Caverns and headed back to Crossroads where I had some mail to pick-up. What I got in the mail made my eyes water and my jaw drop. This kind stranger who owed me nothing told me he had already sold the belt and instead sent me not one BUT TWO lvl 39 epic swords - **Nightblade**. I promised him I would create a Reddit post to honor their kindness. They then sent me a follow-up message with 5g enough to cover the cost of posting the swords on the AH as well.
---
I've played a lot of WoW in the time, but I gotta say this was the most unexpected and kindest thing that I have ever have happened to me. This is going to completely change the lives of our entire group of friends and family in WoW, and I can't thank this person enough.
---
Just wanted to share some positive feels with yall, I hope that I can pass the kindness forward to the next person in need.
---
This is one of the few times I've ever posted anything and first time using Imgur so please any advice or criticism to help me improve my posting skills is welcome.
---
Yeah, those guys were baby back bitches.
---
I spent 300 on it and am happy with it, it is the only upgrade i can get outside of a ring of SP which I might see for weeks/months
---
People are still playing this?
---
Depends on the class.
---
Mages and Warlocks 2 set R10 is best in slot until AQ
---
Because it's the best and they don't want to risk it getting ruined by normies
---
I like that I can allow people to do their job more effectively if I'm holding back the elites that they're trying to kill. I don't need to do all the damage, I just need to make sure that they can.
---
Can I be effective in AV on my 51? And are there any sources of exp? (Enemy NPCs, Rams, etc.) Need to get exalted on my rogue so thinking of starting as soon as I can
---
Yeah we're doing it the same way. Locks get staff, mages get mageblade. It's really just an ego thing tbh, locks are better DPS if you have a disc weaver/spriest and you can keep the fights short but whatever. Locks don't mind, they'll be in line for the sexy BWL staff later on
---
Ugh, we have not gonna a single mageblade or staff in 5 weeks. And I'm first in line for staff (or second for blade, my choice).
---
because everyone is grown up and we dont think playing a nelf is cool anymore
---
ur also a loser
---
112 hours a week should get you to rank 13 after a few weeks or months. Would not be enough for rank 14 though.
---
Anything is a Hunter weapon.
---
Classic Wow Players = Best Players
---
bind ur spells
---
i think you cant say that ppl who are not on curve wotn ever make rank 10 just because they wont be rank 8 this week.
---
on my server when wpvp was open rogues had all the top spots. i was solo roaming as non rogue all the time because it was fun but it was ineffective even tho playing the same hours as the bracket 1 players on my server.
---
and after i realised this after the first week i cut my hours to a point were i could make 1 rank each week.
---
now its my time to shine and i can compete with all the top bracket wpvpers easy and rank 10 shouldnt be a problem hour wise.
---
so as you can see your curve thing isnt accurate at all
---
tried a couple, no chat at all, no one spoke to ya after the invite. promised bags and got none. Was just like being ronin but with a guildname...so left. need to try again I guess.
---
Lmao no doubt. This place is about to get 10x shittier
---
Span of peripheral is 210 degrees no?
---
Pretty sure the screen doesn’t curve past your head aye?
---
I’m a rogue and I do 20% more dps on average than the other rogues in my raid. My gear is not that much better and we have the same rotation, it’s just about uptime and being alive and being on top of every little detail.
---
Yes getting to rank 14 involved a lot of politics and they had queues on who will be the next one to reach rank 14 back then.
---
Yup, I run it on my rtx 2080 I have it setup so it always saves the last 10 minutes of gameplay. So if something happens I want to clip I can save it and trim the clip later.
---
Honestly I don't feel there's any prestige in Classic, it just doesn't feel the same as Vanilla. It feels like we're playing on easy mode. For me it's very much a feeling of "been there, done that" so I just don't care very much, I play for fun, not for prestige.
---
Used to really enjoy being prot in AV. Even just the big group battles that would go on it was fun being able to run in and just survive so long and be a nuisance even if i was doing little damage.
---
When you start does not matter. When you start only determines when you will reach the rank you desire. How consistent you are once you start and how much time you invest into it determines the rank you will be able to reach.
---
heartseeker is the most well known. and everyone ignores arcanite reaper.
---
Lol. These fkn guys
---
is this alliance? because horde does nowhere near 20k honor/h on eu. if you are lucky you do 10k but mostly arround 7-8k per hour because of the queue times. first day you could do like 15k/h because of 3 min queues
---
I agree. Quality Troll situation. We need to find us a suitor
---
i know you said not isntances, the best way to spend your time, if you're planning on healing would be to start doing BRD.  you'll get both xp AND start to gear up for raids.
---
Drops from BRD that you want:
---
Second Wind
---
Hammer of Grace
---
Hands of the exalted Herald
---
Drops in BRD that are servicable instead of prebis:
---
Omnicast boots,
---
Thaurissans' scepter
---
Guiding stave of wisdom
---
Songstone of Ironforge (from saving the princess)
---
spritecaster cape (sucks but hide of the wild is expensive)
---
&gt;The only objective is to get what you need from the instance
---
I need some large scale pvp, AV is perfect
---
Remind him that a ret paladin is easily replaceable
---
No 2 handers but we've got 4 onslaughts now lol
---
Just takes A decent viewership via streaming
---
yeah there are a lot of things where 1.12 is not really a good representation of vanilla. oh well.
---
Take a step back and try to understand what the curve means before twisting what I said.
---
29 for SM Graveyard. 30+ for the rest
---
Well they may not be too different from the Scourge in the way they scheme against the living races, but unless my lore knowledge is outdated, I don't think most of the scourge zombies retain memories of their past or human mannerisms. 
---
The Forsaken have personalities and ways of life not *that* dissimilar from living humans. This means that you can cut deals with them and cooperate, unlike mindless zombies, even if they have ulterior motives. 
---
I don't think most Forsaken would identify or empathize with the scourge. They are monsters, not people.
---
If you believe the usual reddit hype though they are all toxic and horrible no lifers.
---
Drama over a non-bis item. The drama we need.
---
depends on your server. gehennas EU horde 18h a day wont even net you standing 1 you gonna sit at standing 8-10
---
I remember telling myself at the beginning of classic that I’m going for rank 14, how hard could it be? Then phase 2 hit and I was going hard. After couple days go by and I finally realize, there is no competing against no lifers... it will just have to remain a distant dream.
---
It feels so good not worrying about it anymore lol.
---
Everyone wants those rank 11 mounts and most of the people I've talked to think they are going to get them. Yeah, they are in for a surprise.
---
Premade vs premade will be one team afking out because thats faster honor per hour. AV meta will stick around forever if Blizz dont nerf it
---
On an undead it looks perfect! On troll and tauren yeah not so good, i give you that . :)
---
OEB is way better than USF due to the sword skill, right? At least for PvE?
---
honor system scales with pop so thats not really a factor.
---
The Finns didn't win, the just kicked their asses.
---
Love the setup
---
Queues are shorter now, if you’re horde. I imagine alliance won’t be playing AV much after they get their exalted rep.
---
Awesome wife!  That monitor looks great w/ WoW especially considering the FoV isn't stretching.
---
I might need to get myself one now haha...
---
For the Horde!
---
&gt;my wife's boyfriend
---
Dude, you think you can just slide this by? 
---
No, my friend. We need *the details.*
---
Nice Facebook post you have here.
---
Yoda looks terrifying
---
You need to realize a couple things though.
---
a) this is the first gen. That's the most tryhard one. It will get a lot easier over time to rank
---
b) Just because you are not on curve to hit a rank doesn't mean you won't. Lots of people did not want to rank doing phase 2 for good reasons, and it makes sense to gradually increase your standing rather than get the same one every week.
---
oeb is better for pve purely on wep skill there really isnt an argument to be made
---
fair enough
---
Sounds like this dude oblivious to what is going on in his own guild.
---
Until AB is out, but who knows when that is.
---
Lol no. All they did was dodge premades and stomp pugs. 0 skill.
---
South Park Detectives... Nice
---
Is TUF better than OEB?
---
swing timers for efficiency... nice!
---
&gt;You more comfortable with that analogy?
---
More comfortable than lamb and tuna you sick fuck
---
It's a minimum of 12 weeks to get r14 anyway, so 1-2 week of AV zerg isn't going to get them rank 14.
---
If you're a horde warrior looking to do some 2handed fury its alright, I wouldn't bother with either for raiding. Being slower really is a huge leg up for the hammer, and the crit is great for 2handed fury. I wouldn't bother with either in raids. As arms in dungeons, I would prefer the slower hammer, again.
---
Neither of these items are great for raiding, and the hammer is superior for arms dungeons, and better in PvP by a longshot.
---
Seems pretty petty of you even if the guy was misinformed and being stupid in the first place.
---
A guy named turbosoldier with *that* comment history...yeah, the insults kind of roll off.

---
It was epic! I never did it before and we had a blast.
---
Would you rather have 40 minute queues?
---
80 silver a day
---
The cost of a mage water stack.
---
Im personally grinding out av for exalted rep rewards and to get better at pvp.
---
&gt; if u have a skilled group who steamrolls for 10hrs a day your going to be more efficient than the guy who solo queues 30 min wsgs for 20 hours
---
I mean you're saying it right here yourself. Grind for 10 hours. Yeah. Problem is you compete with your own faction over the overall achieved honor. Which is a stupid system which rewards nolifer over skill. Sure a good group will get it faster, but they need to grind longer(!) than the 2nd best grp in their faction or their total accumulated honor falls behind them. A standard MMR system (like they did for Arenas or what you see basically in any other competitive videogame) is MUCH better.
---
That's just Dazzle Camouflage...
---
The alternative is massive queues.
---
That's just the downside of rolling PVE, in general the people seem less toxic and more laid back but the cost of that is there's less people who take the game super serious and less people who are going to be super committed to PVP
---
Are your eyes broke?
---
Even if only facing other pve servers resulted in that (which I doubt, if it was JUST pagle then I'd believe it), I'd be willing to put up with it every now and then if it mean the few games I did get weren't just us afk'ing in GY waiting for our one token.
---
Based on my server, you would be likely to rank down
---
How much hit do you need without weapon skills? What type of PvE are you talking about? Are glancing blows an issue on every mob across a raid, and how does this factor into total DPS across the raid?
---
You made no argument, just "derr weapon skill better pve."
---
Everyone looking for Resto Shamans and Paladins
---
Thats why this screen is curved it stops the warping.
---
Most ultrawides are a curved panel.
---
Btw this sreen is super ultrawide ratio...
---
Normal ultrawide is less insane
---
Pretty sure it's the best honor per hour if your ranking.
---
All Worgen are from another dimension and are Evil, summoned by Evil Magic Bois in classic. In Cata, we discover they were druids who went super feral when trying to control wolf form and were sent to sleep in the Emerald Dream. 
---
Also you can skin the Worgen in Silverpine, right next to Gilneas:)
---
Yea, all Worgen in Silverpine are skinnable.
---
The sword is loads better than the hammer (for pve). +8 swords is unbeatable. Gives you effectivly 3.6% hit and your glancing blows do almost full dmg instead of only 65%.

40K isn't so bad because of the absurd size of the universe and long timespans. Like, stories will happen over 100 years, which provides plenty of time to replenish your population.

Except for Chaos marines. It makes no sense they still have an army.

---
I found the ret pally causing you trouble!
---
In my personal opinion, I feel it's almost necessary as a tank to have Tactical Mastery. Being able to jump to intercept during combat, and not skip a beat in combat is just too good to pass up on. But that's how I play.

Who cares about repair that run back is a bitch.

I've had two fantastic leveling guilds so far. The sad part is when they start dying due to officers hitting 60 and leaving. 5 weeks ago we had dozens of people in a vibrant discord channel talking about potential raid schedules.
---
Now I haven't seen a soul in the discord in 2+
---
weeks. Phase 2 really destroyed a lot of peoples desire to play and the honor system should never have been released without bgs.
---
As a protection Paladin I feel this. BREAK YOURSELVES UPON MY BODY while my mage friend remains entirely protected in my warm embrace.
---
I'm running similar build in PvP. I'd say if you're tanking onyxia or offtanking MC take all the threat. Otherwise it's up to personal preference.   
---
I think I had improved bash so my second feral row is more like 4/5 2/2 0/5 but I got 9k armor in bear and I'm healing raids rather than tanking them.
---
The Spectacled Bear is sometimes known as the Andean Bear because they live in the Andes Mountains.
---
I’m so happy we don’t have to deal with Rey pallys on Horde.
---
We tell our guild that they can play whatever the fuck they want, but if they are bad at it we’ll make them feel bad about being crap.
---
I feel sorry for them tbh
---
Once seems harmless, just to see if it works. After that, no one is going to watch a montage video of it so just stop.

You should be good unless your server has exponentially more mid black pvpers than mine, which I'm pretty certain it wont
---
I’m not gay but coin is coin.
---
Have you tried leveling an Alliance character?  Everything about navigating as an Alliance feels like a pain while Horde's cities, zeppelins, and flight paths are all way more convenient.  
---
I won't argue which races and racials are "better" but I would argue that horde are more fun and immersive than Alliance.
---
It’s okay to admit you’re a filthy casual. No one will laugh.
---
Yes they should lol. Dualwield fury is overrated, at least for Horde, which OP is. WF makes 2h extremly powerful.
---
Yeah no...
---
I farmed them from Nagas in Ferelas. Got a BoE epic or two in the process.

---
In my opinion, from somebody who did grind out rank 10, this week is a horrible week to make any decisions on. It’s not realistic, I’d say 30-40% of people who played a lot this week aren’t people who are going to be trying to rank. They are just people who are trying to get their AV exalted, which by default requires a lot of time. So by default they also got the same amount +/- most of us.

Grinding 300k worth of honor is not a casual thing to do and I have almost that with only 4 days of AV played at about 5-7 hours a day played. And yes, I’m saying I play casually. Once people get their AV rewards, which I would estimate is gonna be about two weeks. I think that’ll be a better time to gauge what effort your desired rank is going to require. 
---
With that being said, no rank 10 is not easy and yes by the end of it, I was tired of playing BGs. However, it is completely doable with a full time job and a family. I know because I work a full time job and have a family. If you’re a solo player, it’s going to be tough, but if you’re spending most of your time playing with an organized premade, it’s doable. As long as you’re winning and playing efficiently. Just being in a premade won’t cut it. You’ve got to win and win quick. 
---
These next 2 - 3 weeks aren’t going to be a great preview of what to expect. It’s just the try hard mw getting their AV epics. So there is hope!
---
I love the mediocre men. Every week in benediction is reviewed in their videos both horde and alliance side and its just great.
---
"Just need a moment to meditate". MOM! BATHROOM!
---
Mish’undare &amp; Mantle of the Black Cabal (both BWL drops) is better than the R10 head and shoulders for casters. 
---
The R10 head and shoulders is far and away better than anything else out now though.
---
all the people that pve but don't pvp have been grinding AV to exalted for the rewards. On alliance that means a ton of people got 200-250k honor without even thinking about the ranking system.
---
There's a vocal minority within every group, they're usually the most salty and obnoxious people you'll ever meet, but you can safely ignore them, or troll them for extra luls.
---
Blizzard has been doing this for a very long time, they know this well.
---
lucky him on my server they are 800-1000g.. for  500g i would be finished since a long time x(
---
8-10 hours per day.
---
The lowest T
---
&gt; On the other end of town you have Arthas and the Alliance brutally murdering people who are infected but not yet turned to undead and lighting their homes on fire to purge the infected. Fires begin raging uncontrollably throughout the city and still burn hot years after the fact.
---
I don't exactly see how this is an example of him being super evil. It was a hard decision he had to make and, ultimately, either you murder civilians before they succumb to the plague--not hard for a paladin to do--or you battle undead who are much harder to defeat in combat (AFTER the civilians have died a horrific, painful death, literally rotting alive).
---
The people who tried to escape would've spread the plague even faster, and that's exactly what Mal'Ganis wanted. He sought to TRANSFORM them all into undead, using them to further destroy all life on Azeroth; Arthas was putting them out of their misery.
---
That's not exactly evil to me. Not explicitly, anyway. Are you saying it would be less evil to do nothing and watch as an entire city suffered in agony, transforming into monsters bent on ending all life?
---
Happened in my guild. We had low roll week sometimes too.
---
Without an MMR system, most teams just queue dodged to R14 without fighting other premades. You could get away with less or no skills as long as you were ready to put in the time. There's a reason a lot of Vanilla R14s lost their glamour when Arenas were introduced.
---
I just play the market and let other people waste their time farming stuff.
---
ye,ye while private server gm were doing it in their basement.
---
What are the main ranks of healing wave you usually cast for each situation? I just got the 8 piece tonight and I'm messing around with some different playstyles.
---
I've used the trinket, it's not bad, but it's by no means mandatory. Like I said, the two Mark's are better most of the time. While active chosen is more total tanking value than SHotM because stam and agi are excellent stats for bears (not counting the extra threat, but the trinket is more mitigation oriented overall)
---
I'm just letting them know it's a situational trinket when you need to have a larger armor level not some every pull bis trinket like Mark of the Chosen
---
Do you have logs? Sims?
---
Yep, as someone on sulfuras, i don't know where the fuck to go to shitpost/talk about guilds, and i'm too much of a boomer to use discord for anything but voice chat.
---
Nobody's yelling, dawg. Just you. I'm not mad or upset or even bothered. Just a bit shocked. Shocked at how much this seems to matter to you and a bit confused that you care THIS much about trying to make me look bad, lazy, or somehow inadequate because I choose to delegate tasks. 
---
But I'm not upset. I genuinely wish you well and hope that you resolve whatever it is that is making you feel... whatever this is. Have a great night, man. I hope that whatever you're doing right now is somehow bringing you joy.
---
Oh ya until they take a TEP.
---
The vast majority of people who say they're shooting for rank 14 now are going to burn out before they reach it. The grind is brutal and soul-destroying. It's still going to be a very exclusive title.
---
Are there any things I can make money with if I stick to gnomish engineering? Or should I just switch over to goblin after getting the bop things?
---
Use rank 1 corruptions on pally. They waste their mana dispelling while you pelt them with shadow bolts and do other warlocky things and it’s a pretty free fight
---
Duuuude love all your clash figures! I covered CR for like 2 years, still love and play it sometimes.
---
Yikes dude. Go read some guides.
---
Just standing in a corner should be enough to prevent being charged in a hole.
---
There's also a risk of being knocked into uncleared packs if you didn't fully clear the previous room.
---
Says the guy with the word "Retard" in his name.
---
I think you're the one who is confused here.
---
it is 58/42 in favor of alliance but alliance usually pvp less so its equal it has 16k listings on the alliance auction house (larger than Blaumeux a "high pop" realm). Would recommend Earthfury
---
I wish the Ring had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened.
---
I prefer high res and high refresh rate over sheer size personally.  At 27"  I feel like going bigger is not actually beneficial but to each his own.
---
Not with 13 minute queues lol. You get around "ideally" 4 sets of queue and play an hour for like 12-20k honor per hour. That's terrible.
---
Oh I’ll try that. Thank you
---
&gt;Ogres aren't playable solely because Blizz can't figure out the female ogre model to their satisfaction (really! look it up).
---
The bigger issue with ogres is people rarely play ugly races. Almost half the pop is blood elf, human or night elf. Even Void Elves, added this expansion, have more players than gnomes or dwarves.
---
Judging by Kultarans, Ogres would likely be the least played race ever if released.

You guys are dense.
---
Again not wrong but it's replies like that that make people get glib and elitist because it feels like you only know the one way to be.
---
I'm guessing you cleared Naxx in 2006, also. Everyone tries to make money off the AH, very few sustain themselves off that alone.
---
Clash Royale
---
It’s funny you say that, I’m on Blaumeux rn. 
---
I have a 26 rogue but I’m willing to ditch that as I’ve also ditched my 28 priest on Arcanite Reaper and 25 Druid on Azuresong. 
---
I just want a fun populated realm with balanced factions.
---
Lmfao no they're all shit in BGs and fuck off to do their own thing. Most of the time I see grob players fishing in av.
---
I raided as Ret thru BWL on Nostalrius so I agree they have some extra duties but it's nothing crazy. I got tired of playing a shit spec and rolled fury for Classic.
---
If you’re killing rams for ram hides and getting 2 rep per turn in or taming wolves for 1 rep each I would much rather have you in the game than Pesko the guy who afk fishes.
---
Refresh rate?  Frame sync?
---
Saw a guy today who is top 10 on my server, he has 1.1 million honor this week... I whispered him and he says he’s been playing 14 hour days of straight pvp
---
I will look at them as a disgrace tbh and maybe they are not mentally ok
---
You can make plenty with herba. Farm plague blooms, dream foil in WPL/EPL
---
Damn Balinda is all horde gets in a lot of AVs. This is brutal
---
Yep, on Whitemane there are literally thousands of fake names with 69696969696969 Honor and shit like that. Before it got fucked, I was projected to move up a full rank. Now it says I'm going to lose rank.
---
hemo is better with a slow weapon in main hand what i do is use a weapon switch macro to switch to dagger mh to ambush then switch back to sword mh for higher hemo damage
---
Plenty of good rets ore useful than bad mages or rogues
---
Yet here you are again, coming back to yell at me, a week later, three times in one day.
---
Good job kid, you absolutely played yourself.
---
What’s the optimal weapon setup in BWL for a non human non orc dw fury with edgemasters?
---
Make that money mane
---
Does is stack with PI?
---
Because I have no ingame audio, you want a 5min silent video over random music? lol
---
All you have to do is pool rage a little bit, and you can deal with any situation that comes up.
---
Prot is better for tanking dungeons, but tanking dungeons doesn't matter anymore.
---
Horde WF 2 Handed Fury.
---
I'm not seeing these tryhard horde raids full of warriors using OEB on 2handed fury. For dungeons optimization makes a huge difference, time is money.
---
Dude 4h per day is a fucking lot...
---
You can make the right choice, pragmatically, and still be doing an evil deed. 
---
The Culling of Stratholme may have saved Lordaeron from that particular Scourge attack, but it was the first crack in Arthas' soul and moral compass because what he did was so undeniably evil, and that atrocity is what set him on the dark path he followed.
---
That boss was so brutal prenerf.  Definitely was my guilds cockblock
---
But a bot can grinds AV 16 hours a day for the next 14 weeks no problem.
---
At least on Staalag, the guys in the top bracket are playing usually 21-22 hours per day with minimal sleep. One of the top this week played AV for 3 days straight.
---
Imagine still believing that this is a relevant factor even several months after Classic release.
---
It's that shitty samsung CHG90 monitor isnt it? Yikes, the image quality is so bad. 49 inch 1080p screen, that's terrible.
---
People who actively try in AV will burn out faster than people who AFK.
---
I mean, you're not wrong. But we're talking about mobs in a videogame.
---
I'd rather farm 350g from scratch than WSG Honored
---
isnt just gear, not everyone wants the burden of being the main tank.

It was actually an easy move. I just picked up Monster Hunter World again :)
---
You can already do that on a higher resolution monitor, with the bonus of all your text looking crisp and sharp too. This one is pixellated as hell.
---
Hey man a gold is a gold lmao
---
Ah bummer. Oh well an extra week is worth the reward. Thanks.
---
Awesome. My guildies and I experimented with FFXIV, but I wasn't happy and so we finally landed on a private server together. It's terrific so far.
---
It's terrible, the resolution is too low for a monitor this size. Physical size isnt everything when the image quality is crap.
---
why do you need pvp on pve server
---
I mean herbs won’t gather themselves and there are a lot of monsters in dungeons still do your job!
---
Its not arms, its 2h fury
---
i heard earthfury had too much alliance.
---
All day basically. 68 recorded hours of AV since it came out
---
Peanut butter and jelly
---
Exactly.  So many here talking about rank 14s not having skill.  When I started the grind in vanilla I was meh at pvp.  At rank 14 I could beat anyone at anytime.  If you pvp 18+ hrs a day for 6 months your skill will be top notch.
---
Lol this guy is like I work a part time job for 1 specific thing in a very broad and large game, it’s not bad!
---
i transferred from blaum to earthfury :)

https://wow.gamepedia.com/File:Ammunitioin.jpg lol...

The single most important addon you can get is an auction house addon. The default one is horrible and with browsing from min bid instead of min buyout you can end up paying more for items. I recommend trade skill master, buying and selling is way faster and efficient. Also if ever you get your hands on some loot out in the world the addon will tell you what it goes for on the auction house!
---
very self aware too. guy in my guild is named undeadmage. also have seen mageundead, udmage
---
If you transform into another race when someone hovers over you it will show what you're transformed as, Eg Goblin Rogue or in this case Gnome Paladin as he has transformed into a Gnome
---
The highest bracket was 0.2% pre 1.12, and increased to 0.3% in 1.12.

Accepted
---
But is it certified gluten free organic?
---
I gotta agree with this. Playing the game i always got the vibe that everyone was loving it and it was exactpy like what was expected.
---
Then i came on the subreddit...
---
It really is like this on just about every games subreddit though. People who spend hundreds of hours playing a game yet vocally bitch about it all the time. Ive never understood this. Every time ive played a game that I liked and then bad updates screwed it up (looking at you Gwent and DOTA Underlords), I’ll just stop playing it.
---
WoW Classic is great imo.
---
Its ok to fuck up.  But make sure you let the raid and officers know before the fight.  Otherwise you look like a player that doesnt do any preparation and just shows up to raid.
---
I was able to get songflower with a guildie once, but every other time I've tried it hasn't worked
---
&gt; the fuck does Classic+ mean if theres no "additional" content 
---
It means "you cant read you dumb fuck". The word is "continent", as an in landmass, as in Outland, Northrend, Draenor, Broken Isles, and Zandalar/Kul Tirus.
---
It's a really big ass screen with a low resolution. The image quality is crap.
---
Y not discord tho?
---
Tbc? This is classic
---
my guild runs 2 resto druids a feral and moonkin, min maxers can go suck a nutsack
---
Oh my sweet summer child, I think the longest I was ever in was 4 hrs but I knew people who had been in games upwards of days. One of my friends in Vanilla joined an AV game in the morning, played a bit, left for school, logged back on some 10 hours later and queued into the same game
---
No one cares about TBC. Foh
---
Nobody is getting R10 with 4 hours this time around. It's not so much that there are more players, it's that a significant portion of them are trying to rank.
---
Oh I can didn’t say I wasn’t :)
---
Or perhaps we can admit blizzard really fucked up a lot of easy things causing problems that were easily avoidable?
---
0 bre here, but 3 eyes and 4 or 5 bracers.
---
just called it it tells ya to go to bnet
---
That's true for the try-hard groups. If you can't find a pre-made to let you in than just make your own. I ran with a 10-man group of guildies today and won almost every game and had a lot of fun.
---
Garry wants to know your location.
---
That’s going to hurt. Incoming “Classic WoW is literally unplayable.” Posts.
---
What?
---
Yep. I'm generally the highest dps hunter despite having the worst gear. Kinda crazy that there are people who can't spend 5 minutes figuring out their rotation. Two hunters in the group don't use multishot for single target, including our raid leader. The fact that I can out dps people despite only having a single enchant is kind of absurd. It's starting to change as we've gotten a couple new hunters who are much better but gear isn't everything.
---
But they are all super super attainable.  There is nothing but apathy that keeps bliz from doing it right.
---
I'm neither of those and I have a binding
---
I'm not the guy you were talking to but i also dont get why would Classic die after Naxx release, BWL being released sooner will only give people more reasons to play and even if we get Naxx by the end of 2020 Classic wont di. Believe me, i know, used to play in a WOTLK private server that ran 3.3.5a for about 7 years and people kept playing it, once Naxx is out, unless Blizzard shuts down the servers i assure you people will be playing the game for years and you'll have a lot of time to maybe even get Naxx on farm.
---
&gt;but still manage to clear MC with ret paladins, ferals, moonkins and arms warriors every week, and we've usually been under 30 people. We use no world buffs and consumes are not required.
---
And it probably takes you multiple hours, even multiple raid nights to do this "easy" content. You also potentially gimp your guild's future by giving the wrong classes certain items (onslaught girdle as an example) and will not only hold your guild back from completing content (Upcoming BWL which you won't be clearing), but also likely forcing potential recruits to other guilds and stagnating your guild into falling idle, or apart. 
---
I'm not telling you that you need to kick ret paladins out of your raid, I'm just saying your need to be giving **EVERY** warrior and onslaught girdle prior to your ret paladins, or you're quite literally hurting your raid and your guild. 
---
There's a reason you don't see 1,000HP engines in cars with 13 inch wheels my friend.
---
Reminds me of madness combat
---
With AV, and even IF (a big if) the WSG meta comes back, a premade that dodges will get rank 14, even if they lose to every other premade. 
---
There is no skill.
---
I feel you.
---
I was just minding my business on my hunter - back when I was running a million alts I had just got it to 30. I decided to go quest in Hillsbrad since I am on a PVE server and that's something I can do when I met this strange Troll Mage. He runs up to me, starts spinning in circles and spams /fart, obviously he wants to fight me. He has three levels on me though and even though I might be able to beat him I don't feel comfortable tagging when he's in my deadzone, so I ignore him. 
---
He gets impatient really fast and runs around some more in a wider circle, probably trying to indicate that he is out of the deadzone, I kinda lost interest at this point though - that is until he walked a little too close to the Alterac Valley Alliance guards. They ran after him and he panic'd a Frost Nova and Blink. Show time. I immediately turn on him and gun him down there and then. I couldn't help but snort at how ridiculous it was.
---
Find arena/anger/golem runs. Shouldn’t take more than an hour or so.
---
Let's not forget about their 12 kids. Oh and alliance Skeram btw
---
If there’s anything I’ve learnt from nights being around my parents and their friends, even grandparents didn’t really grow up lmao
---
Actually funny line of names tbh :D
---
I was in a guild like that back in Vanilla. I only got in because I'd been helped by a level 14 who was wandering Elwynn Forest on my first night playing.
---
Made a couple friends in that guild. One of my fondest memories is a small handful of us questing through the 40-50 range. Started in Stranglethorn and ventured into Tanaris. 
---
Guilds like that are a great way to form bonds with other players. When we split and went our separate ways going into Burning Crusade we mostly stayed in touch no matter what we were doing.
---
I think a huge part of it is also minmaxing and this being the first wave again (also with better rewards than last time). Ranking will be a lot easier in a few months when the first wave has hit their max rank and stopped.
---
Unlike those beautiful Dwarf and Gnome models and female human weapons.
---
Lucky!!
---
Lol trust someone to post just to say "no, your being bad at pvp wrong, this is how your supposed to do it"
---
Is thete an herb/alch trainer in goldshire? If not wheres the closest?
---
IDK about fiery, since its so expensive and the lvl 34 gives you bonebiter from SM.
---
Fiery ain't cheap, I'd rather use a +dmg enchant that is cheaper.
---
Except for roughly half the population Taelan dies to the four elites outside the gate, for some reason. I have no idea how, bad RNG I guess? He destroyed everything in his path when I did the quest on two characters, while a resto druid I ended up helping tried something like 5 times before calling for help.
---
That would require blizzard to have support staff for classic. I think we have seen how little blizzard is willing to "support" this version of the game
---
&gt; alliance usually pvp less
---
yeah...no  
---
alliance were overly dominant for the majority of p2 on earthfury, ESPECIALLY after the 2nd round of new transfers opened
---
Did George Lucas write WoW?
---
He's not dead he's just passed out from the heavy drinking
---
Usually I'd say leave it to the rolls but in this case the guy put in the work.
---
this is wrong, shadow dmg is bis for warlocks while leveling after like 20, especially since warlock gets some of the lowest value from spirit out of all the classes.  
---
Plus the spells they use to kill mobs with have 100%+ coefficients, spelldmg is unequivocally the best.
---
Can you repeat that but as your role player character?
---
Since AV was so full, Blackrock mountain was almost empty! I saw alliance suddenly running around everywhere in burning steppes and searing gorge to kill. Was nice.
---
DIGGY DIGGY HOLE, DIGGY DIGGY HOLE
---
We had a ton of drama when we gave the eye to a (bad) enha shammy... The warriors complained that it should be given to a warrior for pvp and made a big fuss arguing that the enha shammy was bad.... Now, second eye drops and nobody bloody wants it. It goes to a resto sham who "might" make the hammer for pvp...
---
I hope global warming is killing humanity, so much human trash I can just pray the earth will be purged.

I'm in this type of guild on my shaman(my only hordie) and I had lots of great experiences with my guildies. But now they haven't been on for weeks and no one ever talks in chat anymore

Id pay 50s
---
Can also have the person that didnt get the same as the rest to leave queue and talk to npc again, go straight to the bottom of the list and join the queue for the AV that the other players are in cause the newest are in the bottom.
---
My favorite thing is when you're on a boat or something and like half the people there are guildies.  Nobody's grouped or anything, there are just *so freaking many of you*.
---
What does this mean for lvl 19 twinks? A lot of my guild is hoping to be rank 2 tomorrow and are sitting around 5k honor
---
I aimed for rank 3 for the mount discount and called it a day. As much as I would love to shoot for higher ranks, the reality of the honor system in classic is too much for me. I'm the kind of gamer that aims for to be the best at what I'm playing but the honor system is just too much. At the end of the day, it's the players devoting every waking minute of their day that come out on top. Family and responsibility aside, even if I had nothing else to do but play wow, the grind is excessive. Unless you plan on devoting your entire life for what is essentially temporary, settle for a few ranks up and enjoy the other aspects of WoW while getting your 8 hours of sleep.
---
Use the flair Vent / Gripe next time. That is what this is. It isn't a discussion. I've altered your flair for you.
---
Are you gonna grind two million honor in a week just to fuck with them?
---
Must be nice. On Faerlina it’s every man for himself. Every guild leader would just say tough shit.
---
The reason why Loot councils don't do that is people will very quickly leave and get upset if there's nepotism and unfair play. It's your job as a Loot council to make sure things work.
---
Nope. You chose this. If you want something done about this then nerf horde racials and introduce horde-specific login queues. :)
---
Your email probably got hacked
---
Yeah it seems like as quickly as these mega-guilds come together, they can fall apart.  Hazard of the lack of organization I suppose.
---
Hahaha I feel your pain my friend. I've spent more gold on FAPs than I did my epic mount. I was doing PvP pre-BGs in a 4 man team of Warr, Sham, Hunt, Mage. It was fun at times, other times god awful due to no dispells. Sitting there in nova forever is seriously enraging. And then every mage I'd fight has LIP, but luckily I had a shaman friend with me. I love Windfury but for PvP i'd trade it for cleanse/salvation -anyday-.
---
Daggers if you re good, swords if you re bad.
---
Same exact situation with my guild
---
I am having a blast.
---
How’s solo mob killing ability with the PI/holy build? I’m 52 and considering going PI/Holy in a few levels for dungeons and to build towards lasher farming if it isn’t significantly slower than shadow considering I have the AV wand and wand most of the time with shadow anyway
---
It just takes 34 matches to hit exalted?
---
Current sub drama is that a lot of the top ranked pvpers are playing 24 hr days afking, scripting or botting and that blizzard isn't doing anything to stop this
---
Me that kind of orc
---
Thanks!
---
You have no idea what you are talking about.  The game was completely different back then.  For one thing there were way more mobs in AV and they hit harder.  You also had much worse talents and itemization,  imagine having no +spell damage. So none of this rushing nonsence.  
---
AV games lasted considerably longer, lasting 8 hours on average, so good luck on rep from wins.  Not only that you barely got any item drops for turn ins for mobs and enemy player kills.  Imagine 3 armor scraps and a single soldier medallion, instead of 20 of each item dropping from each enemy kill.
---
Thank you for correcting me, apologies for spouting nonsense
---
Tanking as Fury/arms is fun and you have tactical =) did urbs AS Main Tank couple of Times more fun more rage more dmg =) If you want a more tanky approch Skill 1 Point in imp shield block and you are now full Tank that does great dmg ;-)
---
Just kick the whiner out and don't post this shit on reddit ever again.
---
&gt; If (GG - 20% Total) is negative, you cannot lose more than 2500 points.
---
Is this confirmed? I thought missing a week at 50k RP would drop you back down to 40k rp
---
I understand your outlook, but I disagree with it. I think it's really awesome when you come together as a guild to create an awesome item as a reward for the most dedicated player (of the applicable class - so Warrior, Paladin or Shaman) in your raid. Often Hand of Rag will be a reward for having to swing Nightfall in Phase 3 onwards all raid, too. The same with Thunderfury, your guild puts in weeks of work and finally gets those bindings to drop and it gives a huge power boost to your main tank, the guy who has been taking the hits for the whole raid, the player who has arguably the hardest job in the raid and we ALL benefit from him having it. It was really fun when we got our first TF in Vanilla - I'll never forget fighting the Thunderaan boss and our main tank finally getting his Thunderfury - we were into BWL by the time we got our 2nd binding and everyone was super happy for him.  
---
Contrast this with, say, Legion legendaries where everyone gets at least 2, and up to like 30 if you include all the specs, legendary items. Well, that's hardly legendary is it? How is that meaningful at all? Other than the Orange text, how are they any different to any other item?  When I played Legion, the only Legendary items I cared about were my 2 BiS items and  at first it was just annoying cos I didn't have them and it felt like all the other Mages did. Then I got my BiS and then I never thought about them ever again except to say "Oh, lame, a Titanforged wrist at max level. Pity my Legendary is in that slot so it's useless". As for the MoP or WoD style where you complete a huge long quest chain and upgrade your "Legendary" item, well, once again you've got literally every single person in the raid with the same item basically. How is that at all interesting? There's no excitement in waiting for it to drop, no raid wide cheers when it finally does, no guild effort in making a very special item that benefits the whole guild and no feeling of "This is something special that not many people have".  
---
If everyone has something special, it's no longer special.  
---
"When everyone is super, no one is."
---
Maybe a little handbond, I don't mind at all
---
Start from holy, end at holy.
---
LookingForGroup is bigger than LFG on my server
---
imagining basing how good a terrible raid weapon is based on how good it is in raids. People get loot to use in the entire game.
---
you can play 2h fury on horde and will pretty good damage with a weapon like that.
---
imagine still thinking orc male is meta in 2019
---
And paladin just precast and burst heals Ele Shaman:s target. His spell crits, ally player has half of HP, but there's noone to heal Ele Sham except of himself, so he steppes backline and burns what remains of his mana on unefficient nontalented heals hoping to leave combat and drink some mana.
---
Were server four on MC time, have six dps warriors in my raid and three of them are slam spec with 2h prio for pvp gear
---
Havent done AV yet, is it similar to retail? Skip everything and zerg?
---
Data doesn’t tell the whole story... the factions active time is so overwhelming who knows what happens you log on wherever you log on. Everything is at stake
---
.
---
No point in defense gear my dude.
---
I don’t have theory crafting behind this thought but I wouldn’t think that 20 defence would be enough to do any meaningful mitigation for a mage. I’d imagine more spell damage would trump all. 
---
That being said, the extra stam is surely nice.
---
Oh good to know, thanks.
---
I can't believe there are so many insane people...
---
Could look into RFK at 24
---
How about you reroll to Alliance ?
---
Wtf are these graphics. You playing on a tamagotchi?!
---
As a horde boomkin I approve this message :)
---
&gt; they’re just loving it.
---
Most people I know quit because horde outnumbered them 5-1
---
10 hours of AV from revered to exalted seems reasonable
---
Any guild that gave ED to a rogue over a warrior should be laughed off the servee
---
Also I am pretty sure that at some point somebody actually did ask him to join.
---
OP wasn’t the one doing anything?
---
For PvP I'd stick with that combo. For PvE I'd try to get distracting dagger from DM West as OH
---
Get consecration right away, then get improved righteous fury. Any prot talent points after that are basically for more mitigation. 
---
As far as tanking goes, drop a judgement on the main target, refresh your seal, then consecrate until you're oom. Make your consecrate a macro with  
---
-#showtooltip
---
-/startattack
---
-/cast Consecration
---
Then just spam it. Prot paladins are the easiest tank to play in the game. Try to make your parties caster heavy. You will be drinking alot. The casters appreciate the downtime and contribute the most to double-triple pulls which you will have to do because of said downtime.
---
I was big into pvp during the burning crusades but I don't think I can bother with the ranking systme and all this. PvPwise I'm just going to hold out for tbc classic and honor as a currency to buy lower end pvp gear and ranked gear coming from arenas.
---
Yeah I love the experience at first, but I've never seen one make it very far. Always ends up having tons of inactive level 10-20s.
---
What location is that? Nice scenery in the back.
---
Basically he got 21k rep in 34 games. From honored to revered its 12k and 3k from friendly to honored. So I’d say if 21k=34 matches then the total 36ish takes 56 or so. That’s with a greater than 50% win rate though
---
Lol do you even have three level 60’s? Fucking casual.
---
Here I am just wanting to get rank 10 for pvp mounts but it looks like that is also a lot of work.
---
What should worry you more is that you are obviously giving away 2 DPS slots and taking RetPalas with you.  Simply reinforce your Tanks with SdM to compensate for the "DPS" of the RetPalas, throw out the RetPalas and take the real DPS (like ANY other class) with you. Less drama, faster clear-speed = Win-Win.
---
How my guild got our first KT kill in wrath, I was a blood dps though.
---
Ran a walmart guild on Nost for a while and it was great. All the fun of being a guild master that gets to make friends with everyone and none of the stress of setting up and leading 40 man raids. It is always a bit sad to see a good friend you helped a lot hit 60 and move on to bigger things though.
---
Oops, I didn't know it was important to pvp early. Well I'm boned
---
The hell you gonna be raiding with a dude and not even talk to em about loot drops you want?
---
Getting R10 on classic will take longer on most classic servers.
---
How can you improve your pvp when AV is either a Zerg rush or aoe vs aoe most of the time ?
---
+7 weapon skill
---
1. Reduces your hit requirement to 6% instead of 9%
---
2. Reduces your glancing blow damage penalty from 35% to 5%
---
The second point is big, because 40% of your attacks are glancing blows against bosses.
---
&gt; #NoChanges was born as almost an exaggeration to communicate to Blizz to make an actual Classic WoW, not Classic WoW: Retail mode.
---
That's a nice way of saying "this sub was flooded with bad faith posters who downvoted all constructive discussion".
---
oK boOMeR
---
1st run on my hunter. Felt good
---
Offhand with hit bonus from queued hs does not generate as much threat as sunder does. Heroic Strike not consuming a flurry stack was hotfixxed.
---
Some matches, absolutely.
---
When Alliance zergs successfully, they win in about 6-8 minutes, typically. When Horde "zergs" I've notcied it takes about 10-13 minutes.
---
If you look at my chart, look at the times. You can see how long many of the matches go. The average match length is just over 18 minutes, so the vast majority of them are not a sprint to the boss (if they start that way, they usually fail).
---
So, the same record of a washed up MMA fighter? Who cares, gold is gold!
---
The phase between honor introduction and BG's was bad yes, but maybe they should try again now..
---
His stats are from Earthfury.
---
Please do show me a guide where HS is higher prio than sunder spam. ;)
---
I do ZF in 3 pulls as full shatter non imp Blizz spec because I hate that spec and take no defensive abilities. You shouldn’t be getting hit much at all and that’s with playing the spec more likely to get melee’d. Break ice block when they have all just finished their auto attack.
---
Was there ever a game with balanced matchmaking?
---
&gt;Back in the day when you saw a guy with Grand Marshal or High Warlord gear you were thinking to yourself how super awesome and good at the game they were.
---
Can you guys stop with this "everyone was so innocent those days nobody understood the game" bullshit? No, most people didn't think that to themselves. Most everybody knew that it was just a massive grind.
---
I can’t speak for everyone but the people that tried that on my server back in the day were banned pretty quick.  
---
Our biggest issue were the Chinese farmers that would play for eight hours log off then immediately log back in and play for 8 more hours then rinse repeat.  That was forcing us legitimate players to PvP upwards of 20 hrs a day to stay ahead of them.
---
The ones in Pyrewood village are humans during day and have titles like councilman.
---
Not just DW. Even as deep prot.
---
Shrug maximizing your rotation against the various mechanics and different types of bosses is a skill imo. For sure a ret will be behind but I’d prefer to compare classes internally
---
a very outdated PoV.
---
unless you are an orc with an axe or a human with mace or sword, OEB is BiS 2h for a very long time.  
---
you don't easily beat 3% effective hit vs bosses and +~30% glacing damage increase.
---
atm it's just about holding your level (maybe advancing in small increments) until january, when all pve-players and casuals are exalted av and the christmas holidays are over the competition will be smaller again
---
I’m home recovering from surgery so what else am I going to do. I’m off work for 3 months
---
HS is also more threat than sunder. Every swing should be a HS.
---
I loved arena in TBC. Every week, I'd round up 10 of my guild's most casual players and cycle them through a fresh 5v5 team. We'd walk naked into the middle of the arena spamming emotes. Even with a 0/10 winrate, we only needed ~4 games each to qualify for points each week and every 3 wks or so we'd get a free welfare epic. As a full raid prot paladin I was buying the Lamellar pieces to use for a threat set.
---
&gt;Picking up 2/2 or 1/2 Improved Blessing of Wisdom. But I don't know what to give up if I do this. Maybe Blessing of Kings and a Point from Unyielding Faith.
---
Take 2 points from Lasting Judgement. Your judgement gets refreshed on melee swing, so 20s is plenty of time to get your hit in.
---
&gt;- Is Toughness or Anticipation worth picking up? And if so, what would I give up for it?
---
You'd want Toughness because you don't get any benefit from Anticipation while casting. It's your call, but imp. concentration aura would be where you take your points from. 
---
&gt;Is Blessing of Kings worth taking over say, 2/2 Improved Blessing of Wisdom? (Changing another talent point over, probably one of the ones on Unyielding Faith)
---
Yes. Kings is pretty great. Most characters focus on a stat that Kings improves, so it's always a good blessing. Plus, Might applies to melee only.
---
&gt;Is Holy Shock a better talent to pick up over Blessing of Sanctuary? Especially considering PvP situations? How viable do you think this build is in PvP?
---
If you want this to be a PVP build, get Holy Shock instead of BoSanct. BoSanct sees the most value when you're taking hits from 10-50 mobs. You'd be better of blessing Light or Kings.
---
&gt;How viable would this build be for AoE grinding?
---
With the right gear, pretty amazing. You can tank for parties with several mages. RF + Consecration can hold aggro on Blizzard. The Blizzard snare makes it so you can S key, hold aggro, and nobody will get hit.
---
&gt;- Is there any other talents that may be worth getting that I haven't considered?
---
It's a solid build. Holy Power is a must-have for any serious healer. Imp righteous fury is as far as you need to go for tanking. I don't think it would be worth it to drop anything in prot for the retribution talents. The only thing I can think is if you're farming grays, you don't want Redoubt because they won't proc it, but that's about it.
---
How do I see the accurate run number on DBM? My other bosses show but not ‘ring of law’
---
Think I’m only around 100-120
---
None of that stuff was far out of your way if you just played the damn game though. By the time you had your pre-heroic gear from 5-mans you'd have enough rep to get heroic keys, and you'd be doing heroic runs anyway, and you'd be doing Kara/Gruul/Mag anyway.
---
It was a hassle for alts who dinged 60 and wanted to be carried through raid content for easy gear, but for mains it mostly just happened as you played.
---
\*putting my flame suit on\*
---
I have a lot of free time at the office, I can connect to my PC via Team Viewer and can log into WoW and sort of move around and do simple things, but not really play. 
---
Im 50lvl at the moment, If I join AV at 51 and just stay in the tunnel, will I get honor and rep?  
---
Sorry, it's my first character ever.
---
If we didn't, we wouldn't be playing.
---
that is true but you gotta be buffed for 1k+ crits. If you are not its more like 800-900 crits max
---
I have a friend who went from 55 to 60 killing harpies, kobolds, and rams. They came out at 60 exalted with AV. Huge bonus. 
---
I’d also recommend doing the main quest that starts near your general. Can get very good weapons from it at level 51 that are for lvl 60s. Specifically the pole arm is amazing for warriors and pallys.
---
If you are a healer, you’re useful if you stay with pack but overall you’ll get focused in any skirmishes of pvp and you get owned by warmasters Aoe ability. I’d suggest crowd controlling horde or helping guard the opposite enemies end graveyard from back cappers if you want to be helpful. 
---
But overall it’s also just fun.
---
Thanks so much!
---
In the 20/31/0 build is Holy Shield worth getting? Divine Favor looks like a very useful healing talent but it takes 21 points to get.
---
Holy Shield, to me, looks like a very awkward talent. Maybe I just don't understand what it does or how it would be used.
---
 Oh fuck me buddy I had no intention of getting into classic but a mildly drunk raiding guild sounds like s fkn hoot. 
---
No. I must resist.
---
Thanks, i glanced and seen avg time. Totally overlooked the detailed times.
---
Some of those weren't really part of vanilla (e.g. faction balance), others aren't universally wanted (small servers), and some we always knew we wouldn't get (first iterations of content).
---
Nice. Honest question do you get bored of AV?
---
I agree with what that guy said. I would tell your guild that you wanna play with your IRL buddy but that you appreciate them. Tell them to feel free to add you to friends. And if it’s okay with them, stay in their discord. 
---
Classic is a big game and we’ve got quite a while to go before it’s “over.” You may team up with these guys again someday.
---
Not on my server, there’s rogues queuing from TB and farming sili during queue
---
I’ve been building a thorns set for aoe farming as a pally.
---
I was planning to do a holy and prof split so I could still heal effectively but get sanctuary.
---
However, I hear DME solo jumps are much lower gold per hour then originally predicted. 
---
Where else are some good pally aoe farming spots?
---
Is DME as bad as everyone is saying? 
---
Am I wasting my time building a thorns set?
---
A shame the system released as is. This is clearly just not compatible with how people play/how much we know now.
---
I know this is late but you don't lose stacks when you mount.
---
Very brave comment fellow redditor
---
Remulos represent!
---
Don't know what you can do about it if you didn't have 2FA enabled. I seem to recall that you can try to recover your account by contacting support, but I've never had to do it myself.
---
The way you most likely got hacked was by using the same email address and password on some forum or other login-based website whose database was compromised. They then tried all the email/password combinations in various games and stole the accounts where the login worked.
---
Dude couldnt wait a month to repost ha?
---
That's just a one time thing though no?

---
This is my friend trying out slam spec with OEB on horde side.
---
Yes
---
Mages can't parry, so there's little point in stacking defense. 
---
I'd grab the Uther's Strength trinket. Absorption barriers are bugged. The last hit to take down a barrier, (any kind, trinket, priest, or ice barrier) applies to all melee attacks happening that cycle--Like when you drop your ice block and get hit 50 times. 
---
&gt;or i should just stay with the current intellect amount that i currently have in case a few mobs resist too much and i need the extra mana to kill them ?
---
If they resist a nova you're probably better off resetting the pull, because the only way to save the pool without having to evocate later is to use cold snap. The more mobs you pull, the higher the chance is one of them will resist. I do ZF in 3 pulls because of this, you don't even need to use Ice Block that way (though it helps)
---
I can't think of any class that has a single spec that is *great* for all three. Some are okay. Pretty much any lock or hunter spec is going to do okay in PvP and farming, even a full-on PvE raid spec. I would also consider frost mage.
---
Alternatively just find a guild that has no problem with you raiding in a PvP spec. Then you could go whatever you want.
---
Yeah, I didn't bother pushing prior to BGs. I was only R1. And I'm wondering whether a solid week of AV honor will jump me to R3 or not. Anyone expecting big jumps is going to be in for a rude awakening.
---
Also, the disillusioned will be the biggest source of people dropping out of queues.
---
Should be a list of instructions on how to freeze the account I don’t think you will be able to log back in tonight, but more than likely you can negate some of the damage they are doing. 
---
I’ve had to do it many years ago. Then to unfreeze it you’ll fill a form out and send them a photo copy of your photo id it can take up to 72 hours usually.
---
I don't know about money-making specifically, but I like the transporters.
---
The healers had soulstones.
---
Defense doesn’t really make a noticeable difference unless you can get a large amount of it (like becoming uncrushable). I don’t think it’s worth trying to make a defense set work for ZF farming. Sometimes you just gotta take the L if batching decides it’s your time to die is all I can really think to say
---
You probably need a better graphics card
---
Holy shit, as a paladin too! I can't even imagine how this decision can be an issue.
---
So all the people who pay $15 a month and couldn't care less about retail WoW are what?
---
Not sure it applies but what about this?  
---
Check your video card settings for Classic wow. I saw in the recent past on Reddit that for some computers it was changed from say your actual video card to the onboard.
---
The R10 Helm and Shoulders are bis until Naxx for **Fire** Mages, according to the Mage Classic discord.
---
They maybe tryna coping with their lack in other departments, unomsayin
---
wait literally 1 week and see lol
---
We do that to get better parses
---
Just drink a mongoose and wear Cadaverous chest.
---
System &gt; advanced &gt; graphics card. Set to your gpu. The update seems to have broken the auto detector and is defaulting to integrated graphics.
---
I’d be mad as a tank if the mage in the group was rolling on defensive gear.
---
what server is this? 400k is rather small on most realms
---
That's just match length, too.
---
I wish I would have recorded the queue times between each game, but it didn't even occur to me to do that until I was like 10 games into this recording.
---
But I can confidently say the queues were around 10-15 minutes.
---
Delet this
---
actualy you get rep only for balinda and vandar. rest of sourses takes a loooot of time and gives very minor rep. [https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/487003892421361676/655712837351637042/unknown.png?width=816&amp;height=755](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/487003892421361676/655712837351637042/unknown.png?width=816&amp;height=755)
---
The time per match is the crux for horde.
---
Alliance have instant invites and a huge pool of horde to fight against, therefore horde prems are dispersed among the overall horde population.
---
Alliance being the smaller PvP faction has more prems per pug, therefore you can hit prem after prem after prem on horde side, while alliance hits a prem every 10+ game (just some numbers, maybe they hit horde prems after 5 or 20 games, the point should be clear).
---
Im having fun - horde. Trying to win and we sre improving hugely. Won more than loss in last 2 days and honour for rank 10 gear is futile imo; never gonna do that every week.
---
Dropped on our first rag kill and no one wanted it.
---
Pick horde to minmax for pvp 
---
Complain about alliance for minmaxing for rep gain
---
Average length of match for Horde wins = 22.31578947368421‬ minutes
---
Average length of match for Alliance wins = 13.06666666666667‬ minutes
---
So, according to my data, Horde wins 55.8% of the time, but it takes over 9 minutes longer for us to win compared to Alliance.
---
Different people like different things. Something I reminded myself of frequently until I believed it.
---
They can use all dots on all targets
---
It's been like this even back then...
---
So many people are hyped now, we're just several weeks in. Most people don't realise it's just not possible for them and those will give up in following weeks. Only the people without real life will be able to accomplish it.
---
Come to ally world chat is ok ... theres its share of "trolls' ofc but i bet u "got" them also on horde side...
---
What happens when he pop Potion of invulnerability? :o
---
Let me guess, 97 is your birth year.
---
All this doom and gloom is for nothing. The honor grind entirely depends on the rest of your server. *A lot* of people *are* going to casually get rank 10, just not for a few months, and maybe some servers with a lot of PvPers might make it hard or not doable.
---
Back in vanilla I did casually reach rank 10. It was easy because my server wasn't full of try hard PvPers. I never PvP'd more than 2-3 hours a day and I got rank 10 easy. This will be also the case for many in classic - it's just impossible to say what each server's propensity for ranking is going to be. Since honor just came out, it's going to take a while for the hype and rankers to cycle through. After that there's going to be some servers where a lot of casuals are going to rank up.
---
Russians and Brazilians are potatoe IQ players
---
he's right tho, alliance kinda gay
---
Blizzard won't put any effort into Classic, because they can't sell skins and lootboxes.
---
Don't transformed players show as the race they are disguised as?
---
There is something like an ELO for a reason in other games.
---
You stop getting better when you steamroll plebs in Halo, WoW, CS:Go, CoH2 in 5mins. 
---
You will have some skill, but it will remain on that level.
---
How come when I have a bunch of locked chests in my inventory, I dont see the lvl requirement needed to open them? I used to be able to see them, but now I dont, even when I disable all my addons I still dont. What do I need to do?
---
I think if you wanna roll alliance and be on a "balanced" realm you'll be the underdog slightly. I don't think there are any ally dominated realms that aren't at least 60-40 and there's only like 2 of them...? I think heartseeker is one but it's like 80% ally iirc
---
Hours/day is a really poor metric, especially many of those estimates are based on Vanilla numbers.
---
Rank 10 should really read as "Can you play more than 95% of players for 12 consecutive weeks."
---
yeah but then you get tired of people LFG/M deadmines and start wanting to your own groups for end game dungeons or raids but you can't with your guild cause most people aren't 60
---
If you are holding threat as a mt and you are not fury prot your DPS just sucks.
---
Tactical mastery is great but deep prot just isn't viable with the numbers people are pushing.
---
Had a warrior do a 99 parse on magmadar and he died at 20 percent because he popped reck without communicating it and dropped a 5k execute. Insta died and still 99 percentile with 950 DPS.
---
Do you know how many sunders a 5k execute is? 5000*1.5 / 640 = 11.7
---
You need to be focusing on DPS with imp HS. Literally every top parsing warrior is predictions and core hound tooth spamming heroic strike.
---
Looking at how the majority of pvp server roll horde, i would say no one care about childhood but only "beat" the game.
---
It's not. If you're just starting, just look at Week 1 progression rather than Week 5.
---
Based on overall wow popularity, it peaked in Lich King, so it's not untrue.
---
I don't have a DB on me now so can't really comment, but my memories from vanilla involved DB making OP and WW cross the 1k threshold - I loved that weapon. I had some pretty significant AP back then though, I got my DB when I was in partial BWL-AQ40 gear and kept it through full AQ40 gear.
---
I distinctly remember critting for 1.2k-1.4k OPs in my best gear with both enrage and deathwish up, but it wasn't common.
---
Once Im done with the AV grind to exalted, I am really looking forward to levelling an alt without being killed all the time.
---
What the fuck.
---
You really had to make it political, don't you? I managed to touch a nerve while RPing. Damn you sensitive bitches.
---
Heartseeker says hi.

Two intentionally bad players, one is just a dick.

---
Literally can't fly thru Duskwood without seeing that pop up within seconds. Makes we want to rain down 1 tap frost bolts from my griffin
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
You dont have to use the catchup gear in retail though. It's funny because when this whole raid progression system is forced on you, you call it "a real sense of character progression" but when it's presented as an *option* it's bad. 
---
This is just evidence that players will choose to take the easy way out and blame the system.
---
You should be chasing your preraid bis. Int, Stam, spirit, spell dmg, spell hit, and spell crit are the only stats you need.
---
Found another 0.1%er it's amazing how many of them exist!
---
Also a good reason. Needn't only be money making. So good thought~
---
It was always like that (r14 having waay too much time on his hands). However much time back then would be spending ~8hr or so a day pvping. On my server I'm confident the top 10 only sleeps like 6-8 hours per day and is for the rest of the time always in a BG.... 
---
You don't just get 1.4 mil honor on the horde side with an average queue time for AV of 10-15 minutes. Its maybe 10k honor / hour. Though earlier on the queues were far shorter and there was more rushing, right now my average AV game takes 25 minutes and the queue 15 minutes.
---
No you didn't liar. They changed the afk rules already
---
500k is not a "starting point". The "starting point" for the next few weeks is going to be the average honor is takes PvE'ers to get AV exalted. Once that happens they will leave the honor pool. That number is somewhere around 200-250k, depending on their win rate. I got close to 300k honor and I'm bracket 10, which means I'm on pace to reach rank 10. If I consistently get 300k I'll get there quickly because while this week it's bracket 10, three or four weeks from, that' easily going be bracket 11, maybe 12, once the PvE'ers are all exalted and stop getting tons of honor.  
---
Regardless, 300k honor is probably rank 10 material for a lot servers, even if it takes the full 12 weeks to get there.
---
I know that feeling, am at 295 runs myself but seen it twice -.-
---
Queue time went from 4 mins day 1 to 12 mins for me so it's definitely going somewhere.
---
&gt;No skill is involved nor just a little bit of proper PvP
---
There is skill involved in camping FP?
---
HotW NS Druid here, never respecced for raid healing / offtanking / dungeons or pvp.

Farming is better with balance, but the biggest difference is my gear. Not the talents.
---
I really really wish Blizzard would balance classes in classic a bit more so all this "memespec" and "dead weight" bickering would go to hell once and for all.

Arcanist Bindings of all things we didnt even see till 2 weeks ago.
---
But our shaman/locks/druids/hunters? They fuckin' stacked, mate.
---
But this is incorrect aswell because historically horde has had less players on every single blizzlike private server besides maybe kronos 3, i dunno if its the streamers or all the retailplebs but this is a complete 180 to what we've been used to for the past 5 years.
---
Saw a hunter snipe one from a warrior, got kicked from his guild, then kept whispering to him “you mad bro” over and over.
---
Nahh, they'll still be there when you get back.
---
Also, 1k hours ? Are you sure your life priorities are correct ?
---
Hunters will replace it with the T1 chest, warriors will probably not replace it until Naxx.
---
Zugzug, me like big axe.
---
Imagine dying to someone with this movement.
---
Thing is, its so hard to organize any sort of effort in AV that even 5 people can prolong a game for 30+ mins, even if 35 gave up.
---
re roll
---
Sounds like you need to get better.

A difference of 5 strength and 14 agility, which is not insignificant but not huge either. 
---
People definitely obsess over BiS too much. I can’t imagine spending 100+ hours farming the same dungeon and almost quitting the game over not getting a 5-10 DPS increase.
---
Haha this was a common joke amongst our guild, especially because he was a super strict leader, but no.
---
nice
---
You can have the best friends in the world and still WSG will be less honor than AV: " A good WSG premade will yield better honor per hour. " was the premise of this discussion.
---
The whole point of this discussion was whether WSG will start to yield more honor and it will simply not do so if you have to fight premades all day which are - surprise - just as good as yours.
---
Even the best prem in the world will not pull 6min wins against a top 100 premade with a proper roster, consumes, dedication etc.
---
The others *do not* have the same situation to deal with, if you are artificially handicapping yourself by going WSG which is the whole point of this discussion.
---
 WSG vs. AV honorwise AV wins every time on horde side.
---
What? i have a fully bis horde character, thats it. Nobody knew this would happen, and when we picked our faction months before classic came out we had agreed that horde would probably be the underpopulated faction again as its been or priv servers for the last 5 years, we had no way of even knowing the population numbers until now because there is absolutely no official information regarding this
---
That's some great looking corpse paint!
---
id level as swords
---
I had a lvl 60 Gnome kill me while I was questing on my lvl 28 in Hillsbrad and then teabag my corpse. I have no doubt the King of Alliance came down to award him his medal of honor afterward
---
No worries. If you hadn't done any AV yet, you probably wouldn't be familiar with how long a zerg match takes, so just looking at the numbers wouldn't be very helpful without some sort of explanation, anyway.
---
i did not mean to doubt man. i kust want to understand math. i thought that balinda and vandar is the only steady source of rep. i was wrong apperently.
---
So you're telling me that people wanted enhancement shamans solely for their own benefit and not because of the massive buff they provide to melee dps...?
---
Kara was harder than most of vanilla content
---
I am level 2 because i can only play 12 seconds per month and i enjoy the journey
---
I was in an AV yesterday where about 8 of us recalled back and wiped them when Drek was at 3%.. while at the same time offense was starting Vann up north and we got the win.
---
Best AV ever.
---
hahahah thanks im glad you like it
---
You're supposed to be recovering from surgery,
---
Some of our warriors are all 2h hamstring windfury spec and pushing 99 parses.
---
We got lucky on the number of rag axes though. 3 of them.
---
With what evidence? Even in current content ret is substantially ahead of moonkin and ret scales better than any other hybrid dps.
---
Not to mention that the naxx logs from private clearly showed rets significantly ahead of eles, enahncement, moonkins, shadows and about on par with hunters.
---
and again #nochanges fucked "#nochanges ppl" in the butt
---
Ayy Tempest gangggg
---
Ye true, but ur post is about complains about the q time. When you log and have to 15 minutes to do what u wanna do is worth a bit of complaining.
---
I didnt leave ironforge this past week, only to visit the vendor at alterac, i dont care about dungeons any more, i just want fun in the battleground, thank god im alliance, no waiting for me.

I just wanna raid for gear. so much more chill
---
Depends on the fight and strategy.
---
Horde 2h is better than dw for all cleave fights. Including golemagg as you can tank the dogs ontop of him.
---
If you're pushing honor then why are you doing WSG? If AV is the obvious choice then just do AV. I don't know why you'd spend time complaining about it because it wasn't a mystery how honor would be rewarded when BGs were released. If you're sick of solo-queue AV and think that your "skill" should mean you get a higher rank then I have a bridge for sale. Vanilla WoW PvP was never about skill and Classic WoW PvP is not about skill. Whoever plays the most wins and that's why there's so many bots now.
---
That's just not true. Vanilla is about optimization. The person optimally grinding honor for 10 hours a day will beat a bot afking 24 hours a day. Someone who understands the market and has prior experience could have easily made thousands of gold by investing in the AH early on.
---
I was looking at warrior discord and their top recommendations include 2 pieces of black dragonscale gear, that means if you add the chest for that set you’d gain the 2 crit from that. It has 50 AP iirc
---
It depends whether people quit pvp entirely (fewer rankers -&gt; fewer high spots), or just do much less (many ranking low -&gt; more high spots).
---
Can't see any confirmation that that's accurate.
---
AV is new and I bet majority of players there are just wanting to get exalted and never enter AV again. A lot of people are already exalted so queue times will keep rising once more and more people get exalted. And once queues rise, also honor farmers don't see it as effective as it's currently.
---
I’ve done the wall run hundreds of times now, as you said there’s no where near as much down time for patrols, sometimes you’ll kill 2 demons as one can be spawned next to the ghost mushroom spawn in the room next door too. Not only do they drop felcloth and demonic runes they’re the only mob you kill in this that can drop librams, plus the wall run gets you closer to the book spawns.
---
Herbing can adjust your route but you always go right back to the same packs
---
Im not even gonna respond to that, you have no clue how wrong you are
---
So you've spent 52% of the last 111 days playing world of warcraft? This includes both day and night?
---
Why is the queue so long for you?
---
It's not so much obsessing over BiS, it's more about the fact that there is going to be a long was time before you can get something better, if at all. So knowing there is a peice of your gear you can upgrade is something that weighs on you ...
---
longest queue I had as ally was 3 seconds at 3am
---
suffer orcs
---
Other than status, morale boosts, and just being awesome. 
---
But if you live on spreadsheets then I suppose you have a point.
---
Your comment made me unsub from this reddit, gj
---
Obviously Blizzard never anticipated this kind of issue when they made battlegrounds for Vanilla. Remember, PvP was essentially an afterthought when they made the original game. Just because it's still possible in Classic, doesn't mean it's not a bannable offence.
---
But PvP is the way the game is meant to be played. You'll miss out on all the funsies. What's there to do on PvE after you got BiS. /s
---
Rolled PvE alliance, insta queues rock :)
---
Funny how you say this, because the chart you linked says the opposite
---
It's not a 1 shot thou unless you're talking about pyro blast which can only be instant casted once every 3 mins or has a long af cast bar, they are comboing you over a few secs and if it was a enhancment chammy the he just got lucky with windfury and hoj not a 100% guarented like a rekoning bomb
---
Nah. You just go berserk stance and cleave, like your DPS. You don't need a tank spec for any 5 man dungeon.
---
My life is ruined
---
I'm afraid I'll have to teach you something about third base...
---
400k is little? How much do dedicated honor grinders get the first week, do you reckon? I mostly run BGs for fun or rep, so I felt like my 150-170k over 3-4 days wasn't bad - although I realize it's nowhere near competitive which isn't my main goal. I also noticed a steep decline in AV honor / hour over the past days compared to launch day, as more people get exalted and que times increase.
---
G
---
Well, it's the version of AV which came into the game 3 months before the tbc prepatch. This is not the AV players experienced for 15 mnoths in vanilla and thus it makes complete sense to bitch about it.
---
Not to mention, that this AV version forces pvp groups to play AV instead of WSG. AV always was the fun zerg bg to me, not the honor farm.
---
Decent warrs already outdamage hunters by 50-100%, gonna get much worse in bwl and unbearable in aq
---
Yes because the servers named “normal” are actually the anomalies /s
---
They were summoned by Arugal from 'another dimension'. They also weren't technically like, evil evil. Just feral and bloodthirsty. You wouldn't ascribe moral intent to a rabid wolf, so I wouldn't apply it to the Worgen we see in the wild. 
---
So the classic lore, they're just extra dimensional beings that are full of rage and murder and stabbing intentions. In Cata, we find out that all Worgen from that other dimension are actually druids of the pack who attempted to master the wolf form and failed, unable to control Goldrinn's feral rage. They were also unable to be turned back into humanoids, because they lost their minds to the animal form (which AFAIK is possible with any druidic form, similar to how arcane corrupts, but isn't common.) , and so were banished to sleep in the Emerald Dream. Something about the scythe of Elune was also a part of accessing wolf form and of controlling it, I think, but I don't 100% remember that bit. It's covered in the Worgen starting zone.
---
Arugal's Worgen somehow began infecting people in Gilneas, and from there it spread through wounds. Even so, the infected still had to contend with the rage and ferocity I mentioned before which is why all turned individuals became feral and had to be put down, until a master alchemist found a way to restore sanity.
---
I know the frustrations.  Today, I got 60 on my warrior and got into an UBRS as DPS.  I hear, need one more tank and say, “I can off tank”.  Suddenly, somehow I end up solo tanking first time ever. I have no gear, can’t hold aggro, don’t know the pulls don’t know all the mechanics.  It was awful.  I hate tanking.
---
Now that bgs are out the server is alright. Not 50 50 anymore sadly but it's still decent compared to high pop pvp realms
---
Shouldve given some insight on the raid perhaps.
---
He was kind of a newcomer and the others are *decked* *out*.
---
I'm speaking Spinal Reaper on an orc and DBs galore. In these circumstances OEB really does not hold up as DB is only 8DPS below OEB as a 1hander.
---
He was about to die for me but then he just lay on hands'd himself and popped right back to full hp. I've done this quests 3 times now and never had any issues.
---
201 handies for those who are curious.
---
Why is that bad for you? On the off chance you get a short game due to being matched against a premade you get to collect your Honor and requeue immediately. You should hope to get those games if your goal is to maximize Honor
---
It's not that he doesn't "like" feelings, his condition just means he can't understand them, so he's scared of them.
---
Not the best analogy. Everyone knows what happens if you step in front of a speeding car. 
---
As things stand, most won't know about this kind of griefing. It's not reasonable to expect people to avoid a problem, if they don't know the problem exists until it happens, and even then they may not understand what actually happened.
---
Male Bloodelves aren't playable yet
---
I think the Forsaken consider that an added perk ;)
---
He's talking about rank points, not honor points.
---
For a nice write-up of how the honor system works, have a look here:  [https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Honor\_System](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Honor_System)
---
Dude, that was the exact question we were arguing. :D  
---
Is WSG better than AV? And we already came to the conclusion that it's not, if you don't meet certain criterias and it is if you do.
---
Thanks for the advice! I think I'll be taking Holy Shield if it really is that good!
---
I was able to level a pally up to 37 on a private server about a year ago. (Seeing if I liked the game before classic released.) I leveled ret that whole time and definitely enjoyed the experience. Now I guess I am looking for different experience up to 60.
---
I also will mostly be playing when I have a large amount of rested XP, so I think I may stay with Holy/Prot. It may be that I get frustrated and switch over to ret, haha!
---
You should really take his advice. Turn on floating combat text, so it's easy to see the hits, make the cancelaura w/ frost nova, and you shouldn't have a problem at all. I rarely take any Damage, except when they resist.
---
Wait, you are playing on a mac? How does that work?  
---
My Air gets overheated in minutes!
---
I mean, I don't get paid, I just do it for the reputation
---
Same for me. At first I was aiming for the blue set but now I realise how hard it's going to be in the first months...
---
Don't blame it on players. It's just shitty game design and #nochanges cancer
---
Well, sure there is overlap on plate dps gear, that's natural. But having a ret instead of another fury warrior in your raid mean,s oyu have less competition on your desired gear overall. So, instead of whining, that the ret got "your" onslaught girdle, be glad that the ret doesn't care about your chromatically tempered sword, drakefang talisman or chromatic boots.
---
No, because the people that are min/maxing entire raids are hypocrits.
---
You can min/max everything, you can min/max a ret dps build &amp; rotation, you can min/max a melee-moonkin build, or you can min/max a fury dps build. But if you're going to min/max an entire raid-setup and exclude several builds or classes because they underperform, then you better make sure that you ONLY have warrior dps in there. Otherwise you're not really min/maxing, you're just cherrypicking, probably because you dont want to share loot.
---
And you dont even need 1 of every class in the raid to get all the buffs, since top guilds clear mc in under an hour, they could just have 1 of each class outside the raid to buff them up before they go in with 34 warriors, 4 palas and 2 priests. Thats what actual min/maxing would look like, but even top guilds dont do that because either they dont want to waste too much potential loot, or because its hard to find 30 warrior dps that dont mind raiding with 0 chance on loot for months, because for most players loot is still the main drive to raid, not beating unofficial timers.
---
46 runs an no rend mh :(((
---
Interesting chart that confirms my suspicions. When the game drags out over 15 mins. Horde are more likely to win.
---
Can't see any confirmation that it's not accurate.
---
Wait, you guys are getting reputation?
---
That's what people tell themselves, so they don't have to think that they are lesss skilled than the players with less stuff. The fact is that skill and knowledge don’t matter, but time does. So if someone walks by in lesser gear or whatever, it might just be that they have less time than you... But there's a good chance that they have more skill and/or knowledge, too.
---
Idk 220 is pretty weak. I'm honestly not even sure why it's that low because our arms warriors and even our tanks do more on trash and we're alliance.
---
I taste salt.
---
314 runs deep. /suicide
---
Problem is, when the PvE'ers leave the honor grind because everyone is getting exalted, the number of people a bracket allows will also decrease, since I imagine many of them won't even get the 15 HKs to participate in the ranking. With smaller bracket size, you might end up even lower with the same amount of honor gained.
---
This is especially true for any PVE servers. On ours, before BGs, 1 player was in bracket 14, now its 7 players. The total number of ranked people went from around 100 to 700+ respectively. I'd imagine some people will do BGs that didn't do world PVP, but it's still only gonna be 200ish people ranking.
---
What are you soloing as prot, lashers? Based on packs we clear during our 2 man jumps they don't have that great drop tables - but hey, people still farm these and claim anything from 20-40 g per hour, so what do I know.
---
Does anyone actually care about cleave parses on golemagg?
---
Yes we have 1.5M top atm
---
Even if you buy gold, that's still a substantial financial investment. We're talking easily $500 for a weapon that will be replaced in the next tier.
---
Guilds won't really help you since it's a PvP weapon. And the same gold and resources would be much better spent on Lionheart Helms or Foror's or anything else.
---
Ask yourself why you want it. If it's DPS, you're probably gonna do similar DPS with Spinal Reaper. If it's prestige, then why not farm the gold yourself instead of buying gold for prestige?
---
&gt; and of course the onyxia 1 handers, which are BIS, except for BRE on horde
---
Surely DB &gt; BRE by a mile?
---
I mean at least a little bit, I'm proof enough of that. But if we're being honest horde are just as gay.
---
The best feeling is tanking a commander/Van or taking over when a tank dies and I get healed without asking. Ultimate recognition. I'm a relatively noobie tank with pre-BIS tank gear - so being able to tank AV feels kind of good. Much more enjoyable than PVE content imho.
---
Even if you did farm it yourself, you wouldn't save any money, because you could always sell it (opportunity cost). And if it was easily farmable, it wouldn't cost 200g.
---
Can you check DPS for trash fights? They're mysteriously low in the other log and I'm not convinced it's the spec's fault
---
We had a horrible phase 2, now you'll have a horrible phase 2.5, sorry.
---
Oh damn, can't say I envy you - that is quite the grind. Can't be very fun to squeeze out from running AV, WSG might be more fun but you'll need a team as dedicated as you, or two semi-dedicated ones. But still guessing that AV yields more honor per hour on average.. Yea, that is one crazy grind.

If you used to be able to see that text, then it is probably one of you addons removing it. Try disabling all addons and see if the text reappears.  If not, there is nothing you can do, unfortunately.
---
We had one drop and it went to a warrior under condition that the guild is not going to fund it (aside from discounted ingots), so nobody really cared.
---
A binding drop in the first weeks almost ruined everything though, considering there were only a few people in the guild at the time and not a single warrior.

Clearly, too much time on his hands and thinks he's cool for it. Edgy way to farm downvotes.
---
Especially with LC it should go to the guy who put in the effort to farm and craft the hammer himself, the total costs can go up to 15k depending on your server and how high arcanite and sulfuron ingots are.
---
DM east as a Pali you can easily make 300g in 4 -6 hours if you get lucky.
---
The difference is that a level 60 will get nothing out of helping a lower level (like under 40 or whatever). So there is no reward for helping them apart from helping them. But as a level 40 you can help someone like 10 levels lower then you and still get at least exp

Its not trash, its part of the fight?

Regardless. Thats one fight

luci, gehennas, garr, sulfuron, domo. All are stack adds and cleave.

Just got it yesterday after my first try in a couple of weeks

Gettin ganked in EPL when farmin herbs twice by mage and lock. When I get down 3rd time they just sit on my corpse and wait. I didnt wanted to corpserun away, got my ankh rdy. Typed /AFK after 2 min death and they mount up and leave, I ressed afterwards :)
---
Yes but the outcome is the same, you're doing damage that is 100% irrelevant to killing the boss. On other bosses killing adds is actually a part of the fight.
---
Compared to vanilla, sure. But comapred to how ssc and tk was pre-bt patch (the bosses that was killable that is), and even kael after the patch, BT was a breeze. It was a step down in difficulty compared to all other raid content in that expansion.
---
You do. Slam spec is actually OK.

Product. Like honestly, you think your subscription is the only portion you pay?

You think you're only worth the $15? You're worth FAR more to the company... they just don't give a shit, because they got you addicted.

&gt;OEB is better than Bonereavers Edge in raid PvE
---
On humans? In cleave fights?
---
So in about a minute and a half into every fight.
---
It most definitely is the majority of games lol
---
True. Your bracket is for your faction.
---
If everyone in your faction has the same 15min Queue then everyone has the same possible honor outcome meaning that everyone still has the same chances and it only depends on how many People are ranking in your faction and are better/worst than you
---
Is it Sunday already? The week goes by so fast.
---
so still doing better then half your raid with just mongoose. thanks for your input homie have a nice day

Grobbulus is definitely not worth your time. This doesn't represent anything about the server.

What is batching rocket boots?
---
**DON’T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT MY BAD REPUTATION!**
---
That dont matter. Kill bal you get 2k honor in 7-10 mins. If its a non alli premade you get a 2-4k honor in 20-30 mins. Learn you some math boy, it breaks even in the end. Alli premades is something you want in av.
---
A lot of people are currently not in AV for the honor, but for the rep.
---
I don't even mind playing 12 hours a day if I'm, say, sick and off work. But doing the same thing for 12 hours a day? Jesus.
---
It's worth noting that if you've got a lot of mana, it could be valuable to use mana shield as well as ice barrier. I do this with especially large pulls.
---
Honestly this guy sounds like a headache for a guild. By the time this guy finally farms his Mats for the hammer he might actually have another eye drop. Also, since when does how high your DPS is govern who gets loot? That’s a joke in and of itself.
---
ok, this is good to know, thank you.
---
its massive crap without WF
---
Link clip?
---
Why would I even lie.. You can still get kicked for being AFK for a longer time..
---
Make sure to pick up every single BRD quest before heading in there. After doing a good number of arena/anger/golem runs and turning in some quests you're probably 53 and partway into 54. If you get some guildies or friends to help you out you could potentially clear the whole dungeon at that level, although you'd have to be mindful of your aggro radius - especially so in the Torch room. You'd be wanting a 58-60 tank and 56+ DPS for smooth sailing, as well as a good amount of mana pots and water. 
---
The key here is guildie/friend group, as you don't know what you'll be getting with a random pug.
---
Druid and warlock are the best options, neither are "ideal" specs for pvp/pve but they're pretty close.
---
Spriest works too but you'll have to sacrifice some good talents to make a pvp/pve hybrid build. Same for hunter, you'll have an easier time getting into raids and premades compared to SP and tribute farming is OP.
---
Otherwise that's it I think. Healing priests or paladins don't farm well, arcane mages don't pvp well, neither do combat rogues or fury wars.
---
&gt;HS is also more threat than sunder. 
---
Yeah, if you've hacked some TBC raid gear onto your Classic toon. Otherwise gear levels at which Heroic finally surpasses Sunder are probably unobtainable in Classic. And by AQ40 you'll generate so much rage that you spam both anyways.

Try turning off vsync and set the foreground framerate limiter to a multiple of your monitor’s sync rate.

Is there anything that can be done about the absolute legends that spend their whole AV on the bridge snowballing their own teammates off the edge to their inconvenience/death?
---
No we want #nochanges and we want 1.12. Private servers ran 1.12 and was #nochanges for years.
---
Im at 74 and never seen MH or OH even drop.  I hate that boss so much
---
This is a shitty excuse. Battle.net wasn't there in 1.12, but we have that? This is an "out of game" feature, it doesn't matter if we had it or not. If we accept Battle.net being available, we can accept PCT being removed or altered.
---
This is how you win. An uphill battle for sure.
---
&gt;Tactical mastery is great but deep prot just isn't viable with the numbers people are pushing.
---
Alliance side you can comfortably hold threat until roughly 1000 DPS if you itemize correctly. Ad everything in MC is tauntable, so you should have no threat problems.
---
So? BWL has very little loot for ret paladins.

In South Germany its easy to get a Good Job.

---
What is a third base?
---
There isnt even that many demons at that level, better to put on vs or undeadslaying(if there is one, I forgot if there is one) since at that level most ll be at duskwood fighting undead.
---
How would the guy that can barely play be able to farm up the mats for the hammer? Do you expect the guild to do all the work for you with that?
---
Just wait for BWL and grab one of the many 2handers that drop in there.
---
Nice for him. Very good chest piece for a hunter.
---
I´m guessing most people trying to get rank 14 nowadays is not so much for the "look at me i´m rank14", but because of gear and weapons.
---
I´m not in any way trying to go for rank 14 gear and weapons but i´m trying to go for atleast rank 10/11. It doesnt require that same amount of time dedication as going for the rank 13/14 and still gives quite few good pieces of gear.
---
Black dragonscale shoulders, chest and boots= -1 hit -1 crit +40ap compared to savage glad chain, battlechaser’s greaves and truestrike shoulders.

If you are hit-capped it’s really a coin flip. 40ap vs 1% crit! I know i’m defo going for black dragonscale, don’t have time to farm arena for the rest of my life 😁

Yes you have to...what is a third base?

I never did wpvp prior and im at about 300k honor and honorspy is saying i should be 33% of the way through r3.
---
I think its gonna calm down i  a few months.
---
You could afk sure, but the r14 will try to get as many 200vh kill in av alone (like camping the graveyard). You are losing too much by afking and only getting passive honor
---
Sell all your gear.

So I just hit 39 with my Human Priest and I've got 55g.  I've got a load of auctions up atm which I'm hoping should net me another 10g.  What's the best method of getting the rest?  I was thinking of running dungeons until I hit 40.  I've tried farming the rock elementals in Badlands for an hour but only made about 3g - don't really want to do that for the next 10 hours.
---
48 hours of farming some low level dungeon / princess should be plenty of time for that amount.
---
I used it all the way till I got bonebiter.
---
Rebuilt from reference? But in a BFA client?
---
I got guildies to help for free. It's just a few trolls and elementals then an elite mob.
---
Maybe 10g per phase for a non-guildie?
---
Horde can backdoor the cliff. How do you think horde have been capping stormpike gy despite alot of alliance by the bridge?
---
Because they lied? If random dudes in france and eastern europe could cobble together wow classic non 1.12, bliz could if they gave a shit.
---
Why does the game look so much better than mine lol 
---
Can you screenshot you graphics settings?
---
hunter gear
---
XLoot
---
&gt;Just look at the apes.
---
Ya just look at one of the most dedicated and decently skilled guild in Classic. 
---
Average wait time for WSG right now is 15 minutes for Horde US. GL with that.
---
The rogue will probably use evasion but the best way to know is to try ;)
---
My sub just ran out but I have it on "classic" settings, but with maxed out distance view and water lol
---
I got my first one at lvl 54 and the 2nd one at 56 while leveling. 100hp on pvp one, +4 stats for the pvp one
---
First dervish kill for me(3rd arena total) at level 52. Hoj on 15th kill. Won the roll against 4 other people. Everyone rolled on it and I beat the hunter by 1. 2nd sgc dropped for me at level 56 and gave it to the hunter because no one else could wear it.
---
Even for alliance 20k per hour is rly high. The last 2 days EU horde is defending very hard which leads to longer BGs.
---
The higher level you got, the more passive income you will get. Just keep leveling and doing quests and you should be just fine by 42/43 I'd assume. Maybe even earlier.
---
Did the hacker hack your punctuation too?
---
Hold up, you guys bring TWO ret pallies?
---
I'm pretty sure that SGC is BiS for hunters until you have 8/8 T1 for the set bonus. It's a very tiny difference, but SGC should be slightly better than T1 chest before then.
---
&gt;HS is also more threat than sunder.
---
Not even close.. do the math. 
---
\- HS costs about 28 rage (or 25 talented) for on average 154 damage=154 threat (extra offhand hit-chance included)  assuming your target has 0 armor (5 sunder+ fearie fire+ 2 annahilator stacks) with Quelserrar+ Mihras Song. It does not get much better with Perditions blade + Core hound tooth or other popular weapon combinations available at the time unless you have the rank 14 weapons... and its still not even close to Sunder armor in terms of threat/rage.
---
\- Talented sunder costs 12 rage and generates 280 threat flat.
---
Goddamn first it was /r/wow where suddenly acted like my mother trying to make me not play the game too much when a new expansion releases and now /r/classicwow becomes the same shit? Let people make their own choices without judging them ffs. You have zero background knowledge on so many factors, yet you judge him. Maybe he just broke his leg and needed surgery? Sure, might not be perfect to get this little sleep but it isn't gonna kill him. Honestly sounds like you're just mad he gets to play more than you. And that's coming from someone playing like 1h a day on average.
---
Yeah true, that might be the best idea really.  Was kinda hoping I'd be able to get it at 40 but I guess a few levels won't make any difference in the long run.
---
Think you're kida exaggerating this quite abit..
---
MC is already cleared in under 1hour with 0 consumeables used.
---
BWL wont be much harder. but sure you might use some consumes the first runs.
---
its not like you will be spending every day farming consumes to support raiding 4 days per week.. you'll clear MC, bwl and ony in 1 raidnight.
---
Its first when AQ comes it will get abit more interesting and clearing all raids will actually take some time.
---
I suppose you could try and reason with them but I'm not hopeful for your chances.
---
You have profanity filter on? :O  (Good shit btw!!)
---
Deathroll
---
Yes please explain how people are negatively affected by this.
---
&gt; as a way to abuse other players who just want to play the game.
---
How are people's ability to play the game affected?
---
It’s just as good for enhancement as it is for fury. Does kinda suck since that shammy will prolly spend most of his time raiding as resto.
---
It's better for PvP.
---
yea man exactly what im doing. Im getting two new blue weapon every 4 lvls and enchant both with crusader every time and im already half a lvl ahead of a friend of mine who only uses greens.
---
I mean, im already 500g in the negative but who cares aslong as im killing the mobs 20% faster.
---
You need at least 12 weeks to get to R14 if you are every week top of bracket 14.
---
So right now you need to be rank 9 to get rank 14 in the next 7 weeks.
---
You need to plan definitely some more weeks 😅
---
Masterpiece
---
Early on it's gonna be rough. But later down the line, less rankers.
---
In a guild run (which i assume it was), it's super bad manner to snipe a pre-AQ BiS item for a pre-raid BiS that will get replaced by T1. I would also kick a hunter out of my guild if he did roll on that on purpose (without prior knowledge of it being warrior prio)
---
In a Pug run, I would assume most hunters would roll on that, although I still would feel shit rolling on that as a hunter.
---
But most of the healers end up using a lot of cloth anyway
---
Deep feral is not viable in PvP:
---
* you can't afford yourself powershifting with \[Wolfshead Helm\] and \[MCP\] for sustain or burst like you do in PvE
---
* your damage is pretty low regardless of your weapon choice (at least twice lower than a geared the rogue can provide)
---
* you have no reliable CD: Roots are usable only outdoors, Bash has 1 min CD. However your mobility is unparalleled, so you can at least escape
---
* your mana pool is limited in full melee DPS gear, so don't expect to be able to outheal any serious damage
---
Lots of people suggested respeccing to 0/30/21 if you are tauren or 1/29/21 if you are NE. This is a viable build, but you have to mix in both healing and melee dps gear. Your damage will be quite low, but survivability is unparalleled.
---
Why do u keep writing “depression” on everyones post? Stop projecting. Depressed people wouldnt even get out of bed or care sbout this shit.
---
That cancel aura + nova tip is really huge. It would make it so there's never a chance for lag. Just rebind the macro to your regular nova key and you're good to go.
---
That depends massively on age / country / economical situation. There will be plenty of students in European countries where the state is supporting students financially that will be able to do it. Ideally their lifestyle prior to WoW Classic was already setup in a way that the money that comes in covers all costs and it will continue to come in no matter that they do as long as they are a student. If part-time jobs are part of the financial package then it will become problematic. And if none of this applies, then I am all with you: Impressive how ppl live / survive for such a long time when there is clearly no room for any sort of employment.
---
I hope it helps him do 200dps in MC ;) 
---
In my book if you join as resto and don't say anything, I'm not gonna assume you're not rolling on your offspec gear.
---
40% of your white attacks. Still sugnificant.
---
It takes some getting used to but its entirely possible to play without tac mastery, conservative use of bloodrage and a healthy stock of mighty rage potions sees you through most things, the threat is better and you can actually do things solo.
---
Only thing that takes a bit of pre-planning is stepping into zerker rage with 2 charges of shield block as Rag's knockback comes off CD, the damage from the knockback guarantees you rage to intercept back.
---
10/10 would recommend
---
So basically, it's much better to lose :-/
---
What do you want to play? Both are viable mostly. 
---
Enhance is really fun and has some pretty good gear around that level. You can easily play enhance into ZF and get some good upgrades there. You can honestly get into a Mp5 rotation and not have all that much downtime if you're not spamming storm strike -&gt; shock. 
---
Ele is great as you can quite easily off-heal, often in your ele gear. You will go through a lot of fucking water and the downtime is a lot higher. 
---
Personally I enjoyed healing and healed as often as I could. It was easier to heal/ele hybrid but honestly none of the dungeons through marah needed a dedicated healing build. At 41 I did a 11/0/21 build and really liked it since I could do very good ele damage and healing was quite easy with NS and some of the more powerful healing talents. 
---
I pretty much just built on that build till 60 with no problems.
---
The alliance goal is to do that, the horde goal is to stop them from doing that and then get the win in a long game.

---
Only people who weren't really involved in PvP likely thought that in Vanilla. Anyone who tried serious honor grinding understood, or should have understood, rank was mainly determined by how much time you could put into WoW daily.
---
yeah i kinda come here for the memes
---
So you're arguing the Classic players are worth something to Activision Blizzard, which is what I was saying.
---
The blizzard description of the honor system only mentions a flat 20% decay. There's no mention of an honor cap anywhere. Being rank 12 and barely decaying into rank 11 sounds highly unrealistic.
---
You don't get a 15% damage increase that offsets the loss of defiance however, so you're actively gimping your threat gen
---
if people come to a subreddit for memes, by ending memes on there then now fewer people come to the sub
---
they have good memes i love that sub
---
People like to hate resilience completely forgetting that aq-naxx PvP is basically "one shot them before they one shot me" which was gonna get carried over in tbc and arena if no measures were taken.
---
At the same time, you want gearing to be rewarding and see those numbers go up, so blizzard can't just put in a flat -20% dmg to everything in pvp.
---
So the compromise of resilience was born.
---
the only thing catching my eye is, who would sell a scroll for 3s???
---
Don't forget that they shoot around walls like they're James McAvoy in wanted.
---
Then why not keep the memes every day and we can just filter them...? I come here for memes
---
There is no rewards from WSG exalted at the moment anyway. Just some silverwing tabard. The exalted rewards like epic bracers and legs come later. So you can just casually farm some rep, so by the time you hit exalted, or close to exalted the rewards come and you don't need as many anymore.
---
Yeah I wonder if this was intentional when they made the original game. Or it just happened to be like this who knows .
---
This is brilliant and I read the whole thing. Can you explain, in brief terms, your conclusion? I'm a little confused how you say that players who are not R8+ are not on target to reach R10. How can someone who will be R7 today not reach R10? Surely if you keep going, even at a less than optimal pace, if you keep above decay you will always eventually reach R10?
---
okay, take away memes, congrats posts, ranting, theres nothing left
---
That's not that bad. I know a lot of warriors that would pay 100g for a guaranteed 50/50 roll on the chest. It's worth more than 200g for sure, so odds are you'll come out ahead.
---
Yep
---
ppl keep saying MC is easy but i know guilds and seen their warcraftlogs where to this day, they are getting wiped 5x and cannot finish it as ppl have to leave
---
I'm 99% sure that turn-ins give rep to everyone of your faction inside the BG.
---
Due to how HS interacts with your offhand hit% this is straight false.
---
I can't stop watching the video and be amazed
---
It's slowing a lot though. Yesterday, only played 4 grutchingly long matches and only gained 700 rep or so. While my first evening I got 6k rep.
---
Still 15k to go for exalted. Funny how the first 21k took one evening and one sunday and it may take more than  a week to get 15k more :(

---
Same situation i'm currently predicted 88% of R2 from 54% R1.
---
I've done enough AV so far to be 10m off exalted.
---
Why is this item so important? Why not "just" get a raid-tier breastplate? I was grinding the SGC for like 10-30 runs, but now I just got Giantstalker breastplate
---
1.5m for AQ EU, I stayed at r11 with my 1m.
---
I gave up, hopped in to tank a guild BRD run last week (weeks after giving up) and guess what dropped first try!!!!
---
And this time around everyone will be playing one of those classes. RMP was the original, but I think it ended with Druid/Lock/Warrior? Or was it DK?
---
Paladin at 19 is an absolute blast to play. Go in deep, and all the hordes Will focus you while your Rogues and hunters single Them out. When you are close to die just bubble and use a bandage. 
---
Your hunter is in trouble from a Warrior or mage, use bof on Them and watch the Warrior get kited to death. 
---
Only remark is that their Damage is underwhelming.
---
Delete this
---
Isn't that in Dire Maul though?
---
Since there is a post already here, I will ask. Why sometimes I see +1rep continuously? What is happening then? And why sometimes there are +5 in between?
---
Back in the day I quit after 8. 2 bits of gear not worth the fight.
---
Give it like 1 more week and it should rapidly begin to turn back to normal. I play a decent amount but not enough to have hit exalted in AV yet. But expect to be by the end of this week. 
---
Just a matter of people not having enough time to no life it for the first 2-3 days when queue times were good. (At least for horde. Times are around 10-15 min now.) Currently half my guild is still on the AV grind but pretty much all of us plan on going back to dungeons afterwards. And I'm sure we're no where near the only ones with this plan.
---
That is why the meat should be WSG and AV should be nerfed into the ground for honor.  The top rankers should be the top WSG teams that put in the time and actually pvp.  Right now the meta with AV PVE to PVP rank is terrible.
---
How do you keep missing your grenade throws?
---
there is no BG weekends as of yet
---
In fact it is
---
Are you positioning yourself on the ledge so you only engage one group of mobs at a time?
---
Kinda just wondering how they support themself lmao
---
What are the sexiest clothes for a lvl 35 bank alt? Something like Black Mageweave Leggings, but those require 36.
---
&gt;No one farming 300k is going to be losing rank.
---
Bracket 14 on Firemaw alliance is 1.5 million... Bracket 13 is 1.2 million and Bracket 12 is 1 million. 300k puts you in bracket 6... If you are rank 8 this will actually derank you
---
Here comes the pain bitch!
---
I don't get why people don't want to help other people doing quests. It really doesn't matter if it takes 10 secs of your life or 15 mins. We play this game to have fun, it's not a job or competitive e-sports game.
---
&gt; would people just go ‘oh hey that’s someone with way too much free time who can do the most trivial task 15 hours a day every day?’  
---
That's what people thought back in the day as well. Because all they did was do WSG for 15 hours a day. For months. It had nothing to do with skill. Only coordination and having a good flag runner.
---
Source: Was rank 13.
---
done about 300 runs and nothing
---
Wtf? Top pvp are premade and do AV as fast as possible for max honor/hour
---
Im not predicted R3 this week and nearly have AV exalted. Low ranks will be easier later on
---
im a resto shammy and i got it on my first run :)
---
I think this was more epic!
---
First of all, HS costs 15 rage (or 12 talanted but nobody picks that). And hits much harder than you think it does. Take a look at some good logs ([example](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/ZdQ8kRaKxFfM7vH9#type=damage-done&amp;boss=-2&amp;difficulty=0&amp;source=50)) and you see that the average hit for HS is ~400-900, that's up to 1000 threat. 
---
Sunder will never generate that much threat. 
---
It's generally a good indicator to judge a tank, if he spams sunder, he is bad.
---
Lmao
---
Hang in there! I got it in 20 runs
---
Because, unlike Hunter, there really is no comparable alternative for Warrior until P5. Even some tanks will opt to use it until they get T2 chestpiece from Nefarian.
---
For the record, SGC is even better than the R13 chestpiece for DPS Warriors.
---
I see you're a Paladin. Idk for how much Essence of Water you have, but if you didn't do the final quest zones, western plaguelands, eastern, even winterspring felwood and un'goro are worth lots of SURE money and some pvp.
---
When I absolutely need money, that's what I do on prot. I'm almost out of quest atm but I'm pimped af, leveling alt that is entering questing money zones now, will follow by another one, rerolling to give everything to your main is fun, efficient and useful.
---
I had rank 13. I remember exactly how. I was about rank 9 or 10 when I hit level 60. Soloed till 11. The druid of a premade got their rank 13 and I joined them, just in time for summer holiday. I then proceeded to spend 14 hours a day with a total of 25 minutes for breaks, for approximately 2 months. We were the only alliance premade.
---
If you can play at like 6-9am in your server you can probably farm the fire elementals in arathi uncotensted.
---
&gt; In Patch 1.11, the number of NPCs was severely reduced. On some servers, this has led to a strategy that is known as "the race" or "the zerg". In this strategy, both sides bypass the main enemy group and rush the graveyard nearest the enemy base, quickly clear the two bunkers in the base, pull the Marshals, and then pull the General. Each side may also kill the opposing captain and claim a mine or easy Graveyard on the way, but the goal is still to rush the General without directly engaging players of the opposing faction. This leads to a faster-paced game which can be easily won or easily lost, providing more honor per hour than protracted games with the same win rate.

---
fucking 60% andy's, love it.
---
R14 was never about skill. Gladi and r1 was.
---
Yup.
---
I realize the warlock t1 set is rather useless, besides a couple of pieces, outside of pvp. I'm wondering if the (5) set bonus is useful for anything. Does it applies to enslaved pets, too?
---
Whereas Hunters have the luxury of replacing SGC in MC, Warriors are stuck with it until AQ at the earliest. You can't just get another chestpiece that competes. Even the R13 Epic Chest falls short.
---
Just curious, why do people pay this much for Skullflame? Seems like a ton of gold for something you will replace in a few UBRS runs.
---
I've had 1 single game last \~1h as well, although I'm still at 5/21k as I didn't have time to play much Wed/Thurs. 
---
That game alone gave 1250ish reputation though, I'll take that any day over 15 minute losses where we're not defending and the end result is 168-200 rep. Was a hell of a lot more fun, and also pretty rewarding.
---
With 20min que tell me again how you gain 42k rep in a day
---
You picked Horde. Tough ****.
---
No it hasn’t. WRAP IT UP BOYS
---
m8 how you liking them queues now? :D
---
Druid or Mage.  Which ever sounds more fun to you.  I’m currently playing a HotW spec Druid and loving it.  Can tank / heal / PvP effectively all from one spec.  Super underrated in Classic.
---
That strat is good but in my experience gets countered by major healing pots + healthstone to outlast my mana.
---
If warlock abuses pots + engi and has time to prepare the right pet + all cds they will win most fights. The flip side here is that without pet prep they can get stomped pretty easily. For instance a rogue easily stunlocks any warlock with felhunter out.
---
Can't blame em for not wanting to either.
---
It is pretty sad yeah
---
The problem you're describing is a direct result of stubborn people insisting on playing horde when alliance are outnumbered.
---
You made this deliberate choice despite the downsides. Now live with your choice and shitty queue times.
---
Definitely better. Especially if you pair it with another PvP piece (probably the boots if you can afford to drop 1% hit) to get the +20 agility 2 set.
---
Yes it's alliance. Afaik horde does not have organized brackets atm.
---
20k is achievable with premades. There are discords for this.
---
You gotta do what you gotta do. There's no shame in that
---
totally worth it 
---
not playing dungeons for a few weeks and in return get instant queue to all BGs... forever?
---
10/10 would roll alliance again
---
also most people who played on private servers saw this coming miles away, it was completely expected (horde have queue, alliance dont)
---
Which is stupid. Queue yesterday was 15 minutes. I get about 800-1000 rep for a win and 200 rep on a lose. Even a 100 minute game is better rep per hour than 5 fast losses. It would probably only start to become worse at around 130-200 minutes.
---
Do the math. It is not even remotely close even when you factor in the increased hit chance on OH
---
not worth 450g. Please tell me you got your epic mount already.
---
Thunderfury
---
I’ve been playing horde since day 1. Blizzard don’t release player stats so how can you blame the imbalance on the players. There also could have been a maximum capacity for each faction per server.
---
You nope the fuck outta there
---
No, it's not even remotely close to sunder. Also sunder can proc flurry even though it does not do "extra crit damage".
---
look at you moving the goalposts.
---
you made the statement that TUF is better than OEB.    
---
now you bring in 1h which is irrelevant to your incorrect statement.
---
the biggest selling point of OEB, which puts it comfortably above TUF, is the increased glacing blow damage. not to mention the effective hit. you can swap hit items for more AP/crit.  
---
twist and turn, OEB is the BiS 2h wep for anything not human or orc. and due to the 42str its not even far from BRE or SR too.  
---
in fact, OEB beats BRE on bosses in an optimized raid where the BRE proc is useless.
---
you are being downvoted for a reason mate.
---
awww poor horbie
---
AQ
---
better planning next time eh? :D
---
No
---
Well Horde players were 24/7 camping FPs, invading capitals on servers where Alliance are minority for those small honor points, people grew bored of it and stopped enjoying being farmed for hours.  
---
Running to BRM was almost impossible for Alliance while Horde players would just sit and chill waiting for next prey to breach intial line of Honor farmers, now you complain about queues?  
---
Welcome to reality of what happend on a PvP servers, Alliance quit, now you're stuck in queue, enjoy it :D  
---
I still blame Blizzard for not controling how this went out of hand, but oh well! ;)
---
Rad my post again... HS consumes the rage you would normally generate from the attack. With QS that's 13 rage
---
Sure but everyone so damn serious in endgame guilds
---
Because for one class it will be replaced after 2 runs in MC, and for one class it will not be replaced in the next 3 raids. Like come on, if you can’t see the difference I pity the fools who party up with you or are in a guild with you.
---
Thats weird. I also have a laptop with HD4000 and 8 gigs of ram, SD, but windows. On Vanillalike settings I rarely see anything above 40 and only in remote areas with not much details going on.  
---
Am I a sucker or is the mac the ultimate gaming rig?
---
Username checks out.
---
Only one people can craft **Lionheart Helm** on my server horde side. 
---
The price ? 500G with the mats...
---
Is this the same zizek from dragonmaw?
---
You deserve your queue times, I bet you didn't give a fuck when hundreds of alliance were camped outside the world. I still remember the " go to retail, OK boomer " spam from several of you. You can thank your dick faction.
---
I was talking to my girlfriend about this recently:
---
Back when I was a kid, those guys were my heroes. When I see a HWL now I automatically go: "That's either a dude who's unemployed, or a student neglecting his studies."
---
Mines could be worth if the AV were several hours at least. You need like 200 boxes (drop rate is 1) that spawns inside after you capture. Right now its just waste of time.
---
Same - in a cursed guild. ZERO 2handers, except Sulfuras (which isn't that great given a Warrior got it)
---
It's all elvui
---
Have you been in every endgame guild in the world? Wow, that's impressive.
---
Golemag is 2mil lol
---
A someone who got Rank 11 in Vanilla - I ain't touching this shitfest grind
---
Guild masters voice on Discord during Geddon fight, somebody is going to bomb the raid. half a second later, Boom 25 people dead. We still managed to kill Geddon. Had a laugh after that. 
---
(And loot banned the bloody mage for the next 3 raids he attends obviously. /joke)
---
Alliance transferring wouldn't affect your queue times if they continue to play elsewhere.
---
flurry is almost a 15% damage increase (30% of half your dps)? plus crit, impale, etc. I think it winds up pretty close.
---
I'm 400+ runs into this crap myself. I do duo runs, and try to add all the healers i go with. I have 13 healers in my friends list now just for this. I have 46 gorosh kills. What a shit boss
---
1 kilogram?
---
It happened in Vanilla and its happening in Classic. Those guild are usually very good at social aspect but not so good at end game raiding, which leads people to join more serious guilds (if you want to raid), which leads to social guild having less lvl 60 and making it more difficult to raid.
---
I think they already knew that, tbh.
---
Its a light handed comment for conversations sake, relax. This is kind of proving that point a little though
---
They re still there. Sort by new.
---
I agree with going 1/2 dirty deeds IF you have 5 set bonus yes.
---
I’m not complaining.
---
Which server?
---
Oh I agree, but that is not at all what I was commenting on. I'm addressing this no-sympathy-guy and his specific mention of Flamelash and Horde-bad.
---
They were enabled yesterday didn't you read?
---
This can drop off ONY as well. Won the roll and had no idea how expensive it was. massive upgrade for me.
---
Sry I'm tired. I mistook you for OP for some reason.
---
DEEEEAAAAATHHHHH ROLLLLL
---
you literally said what I said, (soloed to rank 11) and it wasnt that hard.  and to getting rank 13/14 we had website with names who to play x-hours etc system in place.  I dont have numbers but there was no wayyy in hell it was crazy amounts of honor like 1mil++like it is now  (it was also bg vs server enemy faction) que and world pvp while waiting...
---
Crying horde is such a joy after p2 :)
---
It is said, it will change when all the PVE'ers reach exalted. Which I think is true.
---
Only alliance. Horde queue times ruins their ability to premade like alliance are doing.
---
Every stick has 2 ends

If you pass on pre raid BIS as a hunter just because it's more valuable for another class you'll never get your items. Just roll on it, SGC is not the only chest piece a warrior can get.  You won't get anywhere if you try to please everyone, someones' always going to be mad.
---
&gt; he no changes people are the ones that want original AV the most. 
---
Objectively correct.
---
&gt; That's where we'll disagree. To me, the 'no changes' crowd were the ones that were the most against Blizzard making any decisions about Classic. 
---
Obviously false.
---
As Paladin, be it dungeon tanking or aoe Money grinds, you will never replace that shield as at least the healing effect is scaling with spellpower.
---
Running 3 mans. 400+Runs in (actually  counting with pen and paper). Killed gorosh 40 Times. No luck. I feel you
---
I read online it has a 15 percent and another website said 20 percent drop rate. Someone commented on here and said they have 5 percent drop rate, so not sure exactly.
---
Tbh i dont even consider 15 min que Times being a problem. Its People with 5 second attention span thats The problem
---
I'm not saying that alliance isn't killing horde, or anything of the sort. I'm just pointing out the faction imbalance to people who were saying it is a balanced server.
---
Devilsaurs use to be like 200g/hour if you knew what you're doing. So I imagine there are other other options as well.
---
&gt; drama    
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; We arent on a DKP system..... 
---
Surprised pickachu face.
---
Yes. In light of how much time it takes to reach rank 14 there is a ton of prestige. You don't respect a guy who lost a ton of body weight because working out is technically challenging, you respect them because they've exercised discipline for a very, very long time. Not to mention, with that much experience under their wing they will be skilled at pvp, if not for brains then by pure playtime. I know a lot of people on classic wow are adults with ego complexes, but it's okay to take a step back, have some backbone and admit when someone else did something impressive.
---
You can tell people that do this are just inexperienced tanks; tons of top-level npcs do this same intercept mechanic and return right back to you.
---
We had a good run while it lasted
---
That's a stupid comment, sorry. Not everyone who's end goal is R10+ aims to get it in the first wave. There are very good arguments to chill out for a few weeks, let the social security funded players get their desired ranks and then start the real push from 6 or 8 (where decay is still okay) up to 10+.
---
Im surprised that there ist no League of Legends at all im there.
---
That healing main hand for rank 14 is insane, just not worth the grind (by a long shot)
---
If you don’t have premade yes
---
I mean if that's your loot policy then you effectively do force everyone who wants the hammer to waste their money without guarantees about the getting the eye.
---
Kaplan for jeff ??
---
Our Boomking just hit 58, Im so excited for the next raid!
---
Yeah finally dropping to zero hp after 1 min and 10 healers afking next to you. Much enjoyment.
---
Who knows the full story , perhaps guy is going ham on consumables tries his hardest and doing decent dps despite class limitations.Position and rotation do matter for every class
---
AV has already risen a *lot* in the last few days. It was 1-4 minutes for the first two days. Now? 15+.
---
And AVs are going longer on average too. Pug horde don't want to zerg as much when they just spent 15 minutes in queue, so games are often 15-20 minutes instead of 8.
---
It's tough to get more than 2 AVs/hour now imo. That's not unrealistic to beat with a WSG premade if you don't lose. And if it gets even worse it'll start to become a sure thing.
---
New people to the game or to pvp will ask, does it take a long time?
---
Jesus... Im new to wow and sold librams for 10s on AH ... FML
---
Damn I was hoping this would fix it for me, sadly it didn't. Like even when standing still on the lowest settings with Vsync turned on and you rotate the camera around it skips frames. Only solution seems to be to play with Vsync turned off and limit the frame rate.
---
I also tried Older NVIDIA drivers and the result was the same, its something Blizzard changed with the latest Update!
---
It dropped my second time doing arena but we had no hunters. All the hunters in my guild gave up a long time ago. 
---
I feel your pain though. I’ve killed Rend probably 50 times and never even seen his MH drop.
---
Unless I'm remembering wrong, which is possible, that wasn't added until like maybe 4-6 months prior to TBC release.
---
I still stand by GL getting that 10% drop rate sword against 15 other fury warriors + rogues.
---
Trivago.
---
The cap on dreadmist is 850k for tier 1 players (top 10 or so) and 750k for anyone else. I'm on 450k and not even breaking into the top 100 people, think around 140.
---
Is it Sunday already?
---
Any server that is balanced probably
---
And you didn't actually see them, they tended to quit WoW due to burnout
---
&gt; The humans enslaved and tortured the orcs until thrall freed them.
---
That kind of happens when you try to invade another race's planet and attempt to commit mass genocide against that race *twice*.
---
Nah, please continue this "someone is wrong on the internet" - thread. 
---
I knew I did a mistake today laughing at the comment of someone saying "spamming HS as DW fury prot is correct rotation". This is just a prime example of someone who is DW fury prot for the sake of logs and nothing else. First you fixx your basic rotation , then start gearing and using consumables more aggressively, finally you respec fury prot.... Unless your DPSers are hitting above \~800 DPS you are still doing fury prot with a shield... DW fury is pretty much only for when you need extreme amounts of threat.
---
No offence but have you actually thought out how gearing would work if they aren’t going to go to level 70? The power creep in Naxx gear is almost game breaking as it is, if they put another expansion on top of that it would be insane. 
---
Yes they could buff up the worst specs with gear, but what are they going to give arms warriors and fire mages without making them stupidly OP?
---
*cries in sub-5k server*
---
I got rank 13 playing WSG and AB premades were you faced lots of other premades as well and those games took skill and coordination!
---
AV wasn't good honor cause it would last several hours but it was damn fun.Now that we got changed AV rank farming is dumbed down for sure
---
A lot of players that intend to rank have skipped or slacked through wpvp phase though, so the curve is very off atm.
---
Activate the boss first? Once all the graves are opened, wouldn't you want to reset so you could hop onto your epic mount? Do you kite them in the zombie room or the scarab room?
---
You dont get to complain about hunter while Ret Paladins exist.
---
You wouldn't get Flurry if you specced arms like above, or you'd lose out on either a main rage spender (MS/Bloodthirst) or improved shield block and defiance.
---
There's no way the Arms/Fury equation works out in a tank scenario, you're losing too much one way or another. And if the above mentioned spec that he supposedly main tanks with is something like 19/32/0, you're a DPS warrior with tank gear, not a main tank. 
---
In a 0/32/19 spec (fury tank) however you still get Flurry so that's out, the threat increase above mentioned player gets is from Impale and Deep Wounds, and this does not make up for what you trade for it. Imp Shield Block, Last Stand, Toughness and Defiance are traded away for... Deflection, Tac Mastery and Impale...?
---
if i randomly said that, sure. but it was in direct response to you getting defensive and lashing out with
---
&gt;They are still better than you though. Their disposable income allows them to do it and their ingame standing is higher than yours.
---
i've got nothing to prove to anyone on the internet, and paying someone else to earn video game achievements for me sure wouldn't help to prove anything.
---
are you the guy in the screenshot? r14 isn't the be-all-end-all to the vast majority of people. yet it's obviously something you're passionate about. passionate about it enough to pay someone else to earn it for you once you realized you are incapable of earning it maybe?
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/522577340?t=7h37m46s
---
What about this, where they proceed to wall hop even though Blizzard explicitly tried to remove all wall hopping for this very reasoning.
---
sodapoppin makes money while streaming while going for it.
---
This was how I made enough money to get my purple mount... it’s not worth the time, it took so long in fact I saw 4 sgcs drop by the time I got 900 gold from vendoring all the arena drops, on average the run is 2g. 2 g x 5 = 10g. 10g an hour ... It’s not worth it as healer unless you’re helping your friend or guild who really wants it. And everyone I helped get it didn’t add me to their friendslist, didn’t give me any extra tip and barely even gave me a thanks it was a bad experience for me
---
Seems like a ton of work when you could increase your dps by about 300% instead by leveling a Warrior and getting pre-raid bis.
---
&gt;If 1 army eradicates the other, they will not, within a couple of years, magically have the combined manpower. 
---
Except they will. 
---
&gt;Also fewer worries -&gt; less army. and less battles -&gt; less experienced Veterans
---
So Daelin was right for this reason too.
---
Can confirm. Leader of our premade was r14 in vanilla and two other pservers. That's 9 months of his life, at least, dedicated to farming AV 16 hours a day...
---
I can 100% tell you that turn ins give everyone rep. I just wasnt sure about hks.
---
Well, these all examples provide some scary examples lol. Cheers all for the input, it seems to be quite a grueling grind. Perhaps it will become easier in a week or two when most people who push AV for rep and the insane rewards will be exalted, and revert to a more relaxed honor grind. I know I'll only be shooting for a few WSGs or AVs a week for the fun of it after hitting exalted.
---
The air is the worst Mac product. I have comps from 2O13 I can run max settings no problem
---
You can't go past rank 3 at level 19.
---
As OP said it wasn't like that in vanilla.Better honor was in premades AB/WSG and you would play against other premades ao it was fun and challenging.With nerfed AV all that changes and its not vanilla exp anymore
---
Pre DM there was no opp cost to grinding this, and that's when I solo'd it and HoJ. Now with DMT runs on the line it costs hunters 100g/hr to farm this.. They should definitely just roll with Deathdealer or R8 (and t1 ofc)
---
Just use none, if you want to lvl fast use a full on quest guide
---
You clearly dont remember all the horde players telling alliance who didnt like getting camped to quit? So they did. Now faction balance is worse and you got queues. Seems like a problem of your own making
---
T1 set is useless for most classes, if not all. MC was the first raid instance, and BLZ didn't have a clear blueprint for itemization at that point. So cut them some slack.
---
When you wanna stop memeing and wanna try winning.
---
Dodged a bullet.
---
Ha i am the one of rare who choses fun.And other horde that wants to defend and win like Venruki for example
---
Used Questie and didn't feel like it was missing anything. It did get a bit boring though, ended up playing with it from \~35-54 and turned it off after that.
---
The only thing we learned is that Nostalrius devs were better.
---
Yes install discord and join the servers of every people you do dungeons or BG with, easy !
---
I am horde.
---
I'm very realistic about it and since I'm on a Pve server with no hardcore pvp ambitions, I'm going to wait the av rush out and go for it next year.
---
That's... Exactly it. I stopped focusing on so much stuff after realizing it was the vanilla honor system (my memories were from BC pre-patch) and started finally... Playing the game
---
thing is that if they ever go beyond vanilla they should definitely make TBC etc. progress through patches, because while in many ways Vanilla got better patch by patch in terms of how your class played and in terms of balance TBC/Wrath is kinda a different case where with every patch the game was just going sideways or even backwards at times
---
like i don't want to play 2.4.3 and 3.3.5 forever
---
i want to experience mace rogues in their original state in TBC, i want to play with pre nerf conflag and many other things ofc, fuck it, im even down to experience pre nerf wrath dk's
---
also obviously just like in vanilla all these changes that happened to classes over all the patches included countless buffs/nerfs/changes to not only classes, but bosses as well, means even if gear etc. progression system is in place bosses would most likely still be easier than they should be
---
I was speaking about you saying "if they resist, you need to reset", obviously you reset after opening graves :p Activate boss, yes. I open graves in 2 pulls. Zombie room.
---
Them Whitemane cheeks UwU
---
That's numberwang!
---
Probably around the same time as every week. I'd try for some patience and maybe a relog.
---
Dunning keuger
---
The guy is a mage?Earn that money
---
Bloodfang seems very balanced, and things have calmed down quite a bit since BGs were released.
---
Eu? Tomorrow morning. NA sometime today.
---
Who cares lmao
---
Well i dont want to lock items when i'm in a random grp but currently i run a different strat, i specifically look for heals who need second wind, a caster for arena waist and rogues who need HoJ. Doing it that way helps everyone, lots of people are interested and i made many friends on my server since i started. My gear is basically preraid BiS plus Lionheart helm and ony axe in mainhand
---
Except it doesn't always work that way, in fact, it seems like most of the time it doesn't. 
---
He dies to the pack of 4 before reaching the tower a lot. Happened to me several times.
---
Also.. it is kinda funny, but in the very log you linked. The tank in question did 16 casts per minute of sunder.. a little much for "just a filler" after gaining 5 stacks.
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/ZdQ8kRaKxFfM7vH9#type=casts&amp;boss=-2&amp;difficulty=0&amp;source=50
---
You know someone who takes them off?
---
Turn ins are raid wide, you get 1 rep for every blood/flesh you turn in. I usually get 100 rep + just for my stuff. Plus the rep for every other person who's defending, its a lot of rep.
---
Why not just level to 36?
---
Can you confirm your using the classic version? I think some people ran into this while using the version for live. Other possible situation is they’ve significantly changed the code and I’ll have to update the website to reflect it.
---
There's a bridge that we have to cross?
---
Horde loved to tell alliance to qq less about wpvp being imbalanced while they zerged people with 2:1 ratios average and now they want a fix cause they have a queue for AV? 
---
Lol trashcans.
---
Where exactly did. they wallhop?
---
U need a flurry axe for oh
---
Well if it is anything like my server back in the day they will sell their account after burning themselves out.
---
Must be fun to play with you.
---
Apparently not.
---
Im the guild master of my guild. We do not discriminate against paladins, and they can roll on the items they need just like everyone else. I don't give two fucks about how much damage you are pushing, if people come prepared and play well they have just as much right as everyone else to roll on the loot that drops. Same goes for boomkins and ferals :-)
---
Skill your fishing. You can fish for about 20-30g per hour in Tanaris
---
BRD is pretty easy once you understand that it's all about managing rank 1 and rank 6 blizzard to get them close to 15% before frostnova -&gt; flamestrike &gt; coc. Resists are pretty iffy, since you need to switch to flamestrike &gt; coc &gt; AE spam, but also need to time your last nova before they flee. If worst comes to worst i kite them around with r1 coc until i have nova for the last finishing combo.
---
Was making a Joke my Gnomie
---
No one else wanted that. Small servers would be trash.
---
Use hearthstone then or tip the mage you lazy ass bitch
---
I was considering the fishing - is it really that bad advice if it would only take a few hours to get my mount money and then continue leveling?
---
Thanks for your reply, but i wasn't ranting or asking about that..
---
For a Hunter no, for a warrior maybe?
---
Always wondered but just noticed? Hmm..
---
My experience has been different, 2g per run should be an absolute minimum not an average. That would mean the only drop in the whole run is the arena boss item and you got a cheap item. Per 5 runs I would normally get 1 elemental fire, a couple of greens, plus the normal 5 blues and some greys which would work out to be about 20-25g. This is for 25 mins of work (maximum) and then you get to chill for a bit because of lockouts. Not really "per hour" since there's so much downtime. 
---
I mainly did it to help my warrior friends more than anything but the gold wasn't as bad as 2g per run for me. Were you taking everything? Whites/Greys included or just the boss item each time
---
oh, you know what I just realized is that the misinformed people probably think "brackets" are "ranks"    
---
     
---
They're probably farmed up like 500k honor and saw that honorspy places them in bracket 8 or something and they're like "I'll be rank 8 next week, guys!"
---
What fish in Tanaris sells for that amount?  I assume they are used for crafting something.
---
Rogue PvP right now but also care about PvE. I have CHT + Darrowspike right now but can buy Lobotomizer. 100g is pretty big deal for me but I'm also below in DKP to 1-2 rogues in my guild so safe to say I won't be getting my Perdition's for the next 2 weeks at the very least.
---
Would you buy Lobotomizer in my shoes?
---
lol yeah you probably should, because when you say, "You literally have to do nothing but watch." but don't actually test that yourself, well, you can probably see why so many people read that advice and then complain about it on reddit and elsewhere.
---
&gt; Sure when we started looking I’m sure a few of us murdered, **rapped**, and pillaged.
---
The Horde was big on hip-hop, huh?
---
Happy cake day you filthy animal....   I hope my kids go up to be as flawless, and infallible as you... Wait... I want them to have fun, and live life to the fullest..  This can't be done with holier than thou blinders on....
---
You need to be in the dungeon to be able to get the drop. 
---
Mob will despawn in 2min
---
It’s like fear is coded to send you into tiny cracks in the mesh of nearby terrain, if there is a bad mesh somewhere some feared cow will find it.
---
Longer queue times for which faction? I saw on average 10 minute queues as Horde. It was my undetstanding that Alliance have basically no queues?
---
The vast majoritiy do! ;)
---
SCatTer ThEm sO WE DoNT hAve tO fIGhT toO mANy aT oNcE - I love this
---
Why is it bad advice? It is better than farming random mobs.
---
I think thats just the reddit or forum mindset. People complain about what they think could be better. Me and my group of friends who still play and most people in my guild are having a great time still. We just recently killed Rag and had a full 40/40 which is new for us. My only gripe is i wish i had more time to play lol.
---
Domo chest req person to be in MC to be able to receive loot.
---
You know that meme image of the guy putting a stick in his bike's wheel and then blaming it on the bike when he gets hurt? Yeah, the orcs are the guy and humans are the bike in this situation.
---
The thing that many people miss is that min-maxing often also sucks for the people who *aren't* min-maxing, because the min-maxer is often intolerable about it. If you don't do things the way they think it should be done, there's going to be problems.
---
back in the day we had a group of friends who would regularly get together for LANs and one of them was a min-maxer. Even when playing something casual like Borderlands, he'd read strategy guides to get the most optimal builds, leveling paths, etc. It was all about being the "best" and doing things the "best" way possible. And he'd get upset that the rest of us didn't want to play that way. The result was that we simply stopped inviting him.
---
Well times change. No matter what you do people will downplay your achivements I have a friend who has been multiple time rank 1 in LoL and the community thinks he is a bum. All this things that you grind for are just for you. It doesn't matter what others think.
---
Muhlio?
---
Need what you need.
---
HKs give 1 rep to everyone in your faction.
---
Some of the repeatable quest turn-ins give 1 rep amd some give 5, but either way they give rep to everyone o. Your faction.
---
You ger oily blackmouth which is vital for PvP, Stonescale Eel which is important for PvE and these mithril bound chests which on average gain you like 2-3g.
---
Got killed by my faction 3 times with snowballs :(
---
I hope Cataclysm comes back some day. I loved those areas, and fondly remembers the launch period and awesome quests.
---
I think swing timer works great for a job like this
---
NA Horde queues as of Monday afternoon were 13-15 mins.
---
Kirtonos is pretty horde heavy. Would have no shortage of targets, most of whom could use a smack.
---
You can be in a raid group and a battleground group
---
Haha well yeah.
---
Looking to pick up a cheap (emphasis on cheap) laptop for work travel, writing and possibly some wow Classic. What do you reckon, would [this potato](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-Ideapad-D330-10IGM-81H3000VSP.429310.0.html) be able to spin Classic with acceptable FPS on low settings? Would not necessarily raid on it, but do some farming/auctions/alt leveling or dungeon grinding. Dual core and integrated graphics makes me wonder.
---
Yes this is what I said. Horde has queue and thusly alliance obviously doesnt. Alliance make more AV's and used to win more, which leads to fewer alliance in the pool as they hit exalted faster. Horde queues were at 15 minutes yesterday. I bet it will be 20 soonish.
---
It wasn't much different in vanilla, you can find pvp videos of grand marshals clicking and backpedalling.
---
That doesn't matter though, of course there's prestige in having the time and dedication to reach anything.
---
I queue on Org and go to Winterspring to farm jujus and water.
---
But your idea is a great one, i shall do it after the next raid to farm my mats again.
---
hmmm How can I enchant weapons? I am a paladin and never knew about it, I am already at lvl 38
---
I mean, i don't really think my chart shows that. You end up getting more rep and more honor for winning a 15-20 match than you do for losing an 8 minute match.
---
Everyone and their moms on alliance side have their exalted. Now I am trying to get exalted and getting 1 win in 10 games. Feelsbadman. And I mean I am only there for help, cause pvp makes no sense to me in vanilla.
---
Mage in my guild equipped tebus blazing longsword... so yeah, he loves idling in IF with that equipped.
---
bannable , just report him .
---
You should be able to go in and change the output to what ever you want (in the LUA code). 
---
Im not sure what you mean by reskin, like square vs circle?
---
I personally don't see how it would help in any significant way for groups. The proc rate and damage is so incredibly low, you'd generate more threat with 1 sapper charge than SF procs through an entire fight.
---

---
hopefully never
---
I didn't record this information, but i got a lot less rep and honor in those quick losses than in a longer win.
---
When I hear someone who is going for rank 14 it honestly makes me a little sad.. just knowing they spent the last 4 months of their lives stuck in a room spamming bgs for hours on end. What really blows my mind is most of these people who are doing it now are in their 20s..how can people in their 20s have that much free time? or be willing to sacrifice their lives that much just for in game pixels. 
---
I know mental health will play a part for some of these players but it is still crazy to think about.
---
That makes sense but I still see it sell for hundreds and I play horde
---
Sadly not, my char is named Ragnathos (Patchwerk-PvP)
---
warlocks need to right-click a table in scholo (the one where you craft flasks, it's 3 mobs extra) paladins need to clear the rattlegore room, start a lengthy event there and kill another boss afterwars (about 20min extra)
---
warlocks need to do a super hard super long event in dm:w after that, don't know what exactly pala has to do, only that it's in dm:w too and involves the tree boss somehow
---
They're fighting melee and it's a duel tournament where you have everything to use every fight. I'm talking about general pvp.
---
Yep.  1 rep per kill.  And i don't believe it is affected by diminishing returns on honor.
---
Just spend the time leveling. Gold gains increase drastically with monster level. Exclusively farming gold at anything below level 60 is basically wasted time. You will get your mount soon enough maybe at 41 but you will be 41 and have a mount instead of being 39 and having a mount and fishing 200.
---
 [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/classicpremade](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/classicpremade)

Try that. We've had good success in our guild running premades. We usually have 20-30 people in group, and we usually get most of our members in. We can sit on discord and chat/plan and its a social hoot.
---
classic sux when's tbc
---
Don't care about honor just want exalted so I can go back to raidlogging. Fuck the alliance.
---
Holy priests are capable of doing DM:E Lasher farms. Pick up herbalism unless you are seriously attached to Enchanting and Tailoring, as both are low income professions. You don't get any real benefit from holding tailoring, unlike casters that want the Bloodvine set bonus in P4, so you shouldn't need to relearn it.
---
Yep.
---
The first day BGs were released, even Horde had instant queues.
---
It went away quickly as more and more people got Exalted. When I finished the grind last night, I was averaging 15 minute queues.
---
I suspected this would happen from the beginning. That's why I rushed to exalted. And I'm glad i finished before they got too much longer.
---
T1 is great for hunters and shamans. Warrior set has good stats (for tanking), so does rogue and some priest pieces.
---
Maybe you should orientate your gameplay about being social and leave those goals as secondary, if that’s what you enjoy.
---
I will do just that, should be easier to do this with a smaller group than 20-30. Thanks for constructive post.
---
It doesn't matter. Honor requirements and Standings are different for every and every faction within servers.
---
I Main a mage too and i allways give a portal at the end of the run, i even do 2 depends wich city they want to go to, for free.. But shazzrah is a really greedy grumpy server to be on honestly
---
I see bits every day in most zones bruh blizzard doesn’t give a fuck
---
Would you really ask all the people who want it to farm mats beforehand? It would be a huge waste assuming you can expect to see 1 eye in like 6 months.
---
It is a bit of a dick move to just farm mats and then expect to get hammer without it being public and determining who gets prio for what reason beforehand.
---
What GPU are you using? the HD4000? on my HD4400 I can get 30-40fps @ 900p with 1-2 setting. How are you getting higher?
---
You make a hunter swing the nightfall because they can brute force the proc with wing clip. Otherwise you’re not looking at having full up-time.
---
Alright nice! Very impressive army you got there haha! All frost mages too... Perfect...
---
If u lose AV you still get rep?
---
the infrastructe has been implemented, the service itself has not been.
---
First things first. At 60 and current phase of WoW, you can heal with **any** spec (would recommend 13 points in holy though for Helaing Light) as long as you buy mana pots and dark runes - your only limit is your mana pool. You can also tank with **any** spec, as long as you have 10 points in holy for Concecration and 13 points in protection for Improved Righteous Fury. So as long as you have those 23 points spent, you are golden to place the rest wherever you want.
---
With that said, my recommendation will be to go 31 points in holy for a fun and versatile PvP spec. You can handle yourself and you can be a very good healer or support for your team. I would recommend something like this  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxurxktVGkhcZM](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxurxktVGkhcZM) Your biggest issue as a tank, is going OOM and mana conservation vs. threat.

Here are some "trap" talents that are **not** worth taking if you go holy/prot:
---
* Anticipation 
---
* Shield Specialization (it is only your shields block value that is increased - not your entire block)
---
* Improved Blessing of Wisdom (this is a talent that requires you to have it buffed, and it's only 3mp5 per talent point)
---
* Reckoning (1. It's broken as f\*ck right now and 2. When they fix it, they have also nerfed it to the ground, because reasons)
---
Also Holy Shield is not very good, so you would almost always not be full protection unless you really want to immerse yourself.
---
Warriors will replace it with Chest from Skeram or T2.5 chest. Also mail chest from ZG snake boss is about equal. And leather chest from BWL is also about equal.
---
you’re a good person, you value other people’s time. Wish there were more ppl like you who care and appreciated others and didn’t think everything revolves around them.
---
All things considered about ten hours or so
---
If you're looking for a fully guided experience, maybe look at something like [this online guide](https://classicwow.live/leveling/)? I haven't really tried it myself, but at first glance it looks like it might be what you're looking for.
---
Depending on your gear, you could perhaps team up with a Fury warrior friend for DM:E jump runs. He'll need some decent gear as well, though, and he must have Mining for picking the Rich Thoriums at the end. You'd also benefit from Herb instead of Tailoring. Plenty of guides / video material on how to duo it, getting and easy 40g/person/hour with this as rShammy +fWarr, more when we luck out. Holy priests can also do some lasher solo farm (comes with gear requirements as well), but I don't think it will be very profitable as you'd also want Herb for that.
---
I think they dislike it conceptually but appreciate the attention it brings. I swear either Gamefreak or Blizzard tried to start suing r34 makers for taking their IP at some point though.
---
Tell me about it. I spent like 12h on Sunday and gained 100k honour because of the queues.
---
Dont buy stuff you cant afford.
---
Can someone ELI5 the difference between brackets and rank? I am not sure how they fit together on the way through the ranks..and brackets..
---
True, but a lot of MC fights don’t last that long
---
Maybe short italian plumbers are all the rage with the women these days? Must be the mustache.
---
Right now it's selling for about the same horde vs. alliance on my server, there's no profit in that. Maybe other servers are different, mine has a small horde population so maybe there's actual demand for it.
---
Yeah, that's why I quoted it genius.
---
Honestly, not getting enough sleep is a significant risk factor in regards to practically anything you don't want to contract, especially if it's over a prolonged time period. Many young people shrug it off with comments like "But I don't feel tired", which is likely due to their worsened perception. It's also completely irrelevant to the actual needs of your body which can easily be masked by the bodies defense mechanisms.
---
Except you're wrong though. AV games don't pop every 15 minutes, they pop every 10 seconds same as alliance you're just waiting behind 4000 people to get in one.
---
Are there any reasons to stick with gnomish engineering? Or should I just switch over to goblin after getting the bop things?
---
Now y'see... I loved some of the higher level stuff in Cata, but I hated what it did to the starting areas. I actually started playing six months before Cata came out and I'd loved the old-school Dwarf levelling in Dun Morogh, but then I came back after Cata to level more characters and the experience was much less fun. Less running around, less exploration, more flight points. They took all the soul out of it. It's why I was so happy when they brought back Classic.
---
Congratulations! Me and my Guildmate just finished our sets this week too. :) (We are a priest and a paladin)
---
As I stated above to the other poster I forgot to mention theses were leveling weapons. Also it is a top 10 list ranking the weapons so I would have to mention stats in it. However what I believe your trying to say albeit condescending, is that the post needs more personality, which is noted. I welcome all types of criticism, no matter how harsh it is.
---
You know what they say when you assume things, but to each there own.
---
Account is not bought, original account holder. again shouldn’t assume things.
---
I would be lying in saying that I’m not self promoting, however I want to promote discussion on the subject. This goes for any list that I have posted on reddit or anywhere else. Also my promotions follow reddit rules.
---
I mean if the quests is what you're looking for, they're all essentially exactly like they were during release on retail.
---
I’m alliance and constantly hear “rushing doesn’t work” but looking at your data all but one of your losses was under 20mins.
---
Downvote me all you like,  it’s not my data but it supports that rushing works.
---
Earthfury is absolutely an Alliance refugee server.
---
It’s BiS for fury warriors until naxx, what are even talking about my dude?
---
If you want 'easy' money on lvl 40 i would just recommend to do questing to lvl 60, you'll get plenty of gold.
---
SFK drops some good twink gear but its rare so you'll have to do a lot of runs.
---
As you stated "You have no clue how wrong you are."  I played Horde in Vanilla through Wrath.  Guess what? I rolled Alliance because I knew everyone was going Horde.  Now I have instant BG's. Deal with it.  The queues are not even that bad, I remember 35+mins for everything back in the day.
---
15 min queue means i can world pvp or farm while waiting it's great.
---
No, it’s all a lie. The Libram drops off Hogger.
---
A hunter needing on HoJ lmao
---
If they're using vw against mages and the mages aren't just ccing them, killing the pets, reseting the fight over and over the mages are dumb. Mages should win against soul link if the locks can't dispel sheep.
---
Tried messing with the triple buffer setting under advanced?
---
I would somewhat agree that could be the case, if, I didn’t continue to pvp for years after against countless other players and still could beat whoever I wanted.  
---
If you don’t think constantly practicing something for hours a day for months and years will make someone better then I don’t know what to tell you.  I liked  pvp so much that I spent most of the many years after just pvping.
---
I meant someone to respond to the report. Carry on with whatever agenda you are on about tho
---
Logitech mouses are great but the scroll wheel tends to be very sensitive on their low to mid end range. There should be an obvious bump when you scroll which indicates it has travelled one section, if you do not feel that bump then the mouse wheel is potentially damaged which may be causing your problem.
---
Hey, i have this EXACT same issue.
---
Most of the time everythings fine but then once in a while right clicking will drop by FPS to almost exactly 40 when i hold the right mouse button including microstutters.
---
Switching to windowed mode and back always fixes it but its annoying as fuck.
---
I have the same drop to 40 when i use mouse pointer trails.
---
Rushing does work for Alliance since you guys have instant queues. If you had longer queues like Horde, rushing would be a bad strategy. 
---
Basically Horde have to make the most of every minute that we're in a game, because we have approximately 15 minute long queues. You guys can just spam matches. You get your rep from fast completions. We get ours from turn-ins and farming HKs.
---
Daze.
---
Do you always point your camera through her wings?
---
Blizzard did not learn that because they already knew it to be true.
---
I don't think it's useless at all, I think it has its places depending on your current gear, like I had mostly pre raid bis and you jist don't get enough raw stats out of them I feel, with stam and int, I have used 3 pieces currently, belt, gloves and shoulders to even out my stats with my spell power, I had over 300 SP but was oom and a glass cannon, now with these 3 bits, I still have over 300 SP, due to also getting t1 legs and a huge chunk of stats stats now that I was really lacking following the pre raid bis
---
brackets determine how many ranking points you gain each week (the # of points can be a negative number because the automatic decay)
---
bracket 14 gets the most points, then bracket 13 etc, then bracket 12 etc.
---
The points then determine in what RANK you end up.
---
Example: Somebody with RANK 5  can be in BRACKET 12 that week if he played a TON of pvp  (because bracket 12 is very high)  Or he could be in BRACKET 1 that week, if he barely played.  His rank 5 will move to rank 6 if he got enough points from bracket 12, or decline to rank 4 if he lost many points.
---
I'm having a ton of fun in AV. Maybe you should focus less on the grind
---
Losing half a rank at 10+ is nothing to sneeze at. It's easy 2-3 weeks gone in flames. Enough to make rankers quit entirely.
---
Hi gentlemen. 
---
Oh contrai halfwit, this video is art.
---
Obviously you flunked your liberal arts degree otherwise you'd understand.   
---
Feel free to shave the hair on your neck and have a laugh.

Deep prot with impale has the same TPS as fury/prot if you are using shield. Fury/prot generates more threat only if you are dualwielding. And with the claw you r gonna be fine tanking bosses
---
I hope for OP's sake you're right, but I've talked to other players with this exact dilemma and they were unable to recover items and were told specifically by GMs that they couldn't recover them because it was a player mistake, not a game bug. 
---
I have not done this myself so I'll defer to you until proven otherwise.
---
That's been my experience as well.  I'm only leveling rogue now and not 60 but I can say with reasonable certainty I haven't had Vanish fail even once.  
---
But it will tonight...
---
Thanks for the chuckle
---
About $1200. And I bought the 1070ti on ebay for $300 when they were retailing for like $550. I can play new games on max settings or close and get 60+ fps. Mostly play classic wow tho. My computer sits at idle pretty much when I play and i get a solid 144fps lol
---
Ah ok, so when I do it I am group leader and I set the loot to free for all and tell the warrior not to loot anything apart from Gorosh. I take all greys/whites/greens/blues and elemental fire is 7g each on my server. That probably accounts for the difference.
---
Which if they just do the strat theyd get more honor per hour.
---
Because people who are not happy have either moved on or complain in different avenues. Don't fall for the confirmation bias of bubbles.
---
Yeah this is it - I was tempted to go for the rank 14 grind but then realised that any of the gear I would earn would be invalidated by PvE gear months later. In all reality it’s just a case of who had sat in a chair and clicked buttons longer with no real indication of skill.
---
I’ve decided to put time into getting my house renovated a bit more and levelling other characters up with friends. Far more enjoyable than spamming the same BG a million times.
---
you will be rank 3 I think, or maybe rank 4.  it's not possible to to skip more ranks.
---
Hi, /u/SingleCellSickness

This is "the MC that existed for 90% of Vanilla." Talent changes aren't that big of an impact (and half of them happened over a year before 1.12). The main difference is player knowledge which you can't just erase from people's brains.
---
No, I’m practical. Discord is so popular in the community because....the in game voice chat is not operable. Thus my answer was......get discord.

Wow classic made me not buy a new computer for a lot of money (i use a 7 year old Lenovo y500 laptop - 3rd gen i3, 8gb ram 1600mhz, geforce 650m 2+2gb sli, ssd)

Chirstian?
---
If the comments has taught me anything here, its that there is no correct way to ask for water. Its all down to the individual quirks of the mage at hand.
---
Lmao all the sad ally tears on this sub, am ally here btw.
---
yeah it sucks, the fact that there's this large imbalance sucks, and the fact that AV is the best honor per hour for horde sucks tremulously. IMO nerfing av honor gain is the only sense-able choice, that way you can premade WSG and play with your friends, and also experience a proper pvp ranking.
---
Also faster queues for AV spam, much much faster than eg in 3 months

Try this

Do you have a monitor to show those juicy fps? I top out at like 60, but hey - less than $20.

Any videos on that?

---
Imagine being this slow
---
&gt; Can anyone help me out? 
---
with what ?
---
Basically if you play Paladin, Holy is good late game and Ret is always viable.  Most people level as ret and then swap over. Protection might as well not exist.
---
If you play Druid, Feral Tank is good for specific end game content, and raids of 40 people will want exactly one Boomkin. (Balance). Druid healers also work.
---
Druid will be easier to level given how flexible they are.
---
Both are very fun to play, good for soloing  with self-heals and an array of tools.  If you love the idea of a Paladin specifically, do that.  If you want to slot into any party, go Druid.
---
Tanaris vs Winterspring teleport.
---
I will keep Gnomish for Tanaris and have someone else craft the goblin stuff &gt;:)
---
Yes, but you have to play a Warrior.
---
"Let us win or we wont play anymore" alliance really are a disgusting wretch of a faction.
---
Wow thanks for the answer! I'll try it out but these mobs are quite beefy!
---
A good way to farm dm e as i dont have herb!
---
Same thing happened in retail mythic raid, it is the nature of classic raid. You need 40 decent raid for future harder raid. Since you can't expect 100% attendance, you will need extra(bench player) to replace absent who those who quit. So they create a second raid for those extra person that are new or not good enough for the core team.
---
Awesome. 
---
Maybe WSG will be decent option then.
---
Hijacking this to also add if it's possible for a solo or 2 man anger for HoJ drop?
---
Let us win or we wont play anymore WAAAAAAHHH
---
Funny how it is always Blizzard's fault whatever bad thing happens. Like, did they make horde lock down most of the servers? Did they make horde borderline harass and grief alliance players to the point most of them found it better just to quit? Did Blizzard make you roll a faction that is clearly better in terms of racials, so you can have an advantage from day1?
---
The guy who played less would eventually be able to farm the mats  by why should he be punished for having less play time. The fair thing would have been to roll for the item.
---
Druid discord should be a thing
---
Yes, a rogue can solo angerforge using ledge kiting, it requires some decent gear I think.
---
Two man is a lot easier, and potentially significantly faster with a druid friend.
---
play a pve server if your a dadgamer who plays 1hr a week sure, if you actually plan to play the game play pvp because that way you're not missing half of the entire game
---
Took me the third drop to finally win it (i.e. taking nobody else who needed it) and about 220-250 runs to get it myself. Don’t give up!!
---
Because drops pre week are limited. There are only so many Vis'kags that you can squeeze from Ony and not many more brutality blades in MC.
---
Approximately 90% of warriors AND rogues Alliance side are humans and roll for swords.
---
&gt; HKs give 1 rep to everyone in your faction.
---
You sure about that?
---
Mine is 2H only
---
I love you.
---
You make healing in AV a breeze.
---
You make carrying the flag, NBD.
---
\-Healer in BGs 
---
Bonus: I love the warrior charge sound.
---
Yes to Anger, not sure about Princess.
---
Haha I love the games where we stop allies from killing galv and lieutenants so they end up with nothing.
---
For some reason it’s feels good to actively slow down the progression of your enemy. How weird.
---
edited my post, hopefully it's more clear now
---
Same thing happened in retail mythic raid, it is the nature of classic raid. You need a constant 40 decent raider for future harder raid. Since you can't expect 100% attendance, you will need extra(bench player) to replace absent and those who quit. So they create a second raid for those extra person that are new or not good enough for the core team.
---
Not if you rebrand yourself as an excommunicated Paladin.
---
I kinda did not realize memes are/were(?) illegal. Honestly what is the point then?
---
Iirc we cleared rag with one group then split the  raid into 2 groups and we've been clearing rag 2 times per week since then even if sometimes it was a bit messier/longer. And we're not even close to being good.
---
There have been like 5 croc death posts in the last 2 days? Is everyone leveling warlock alts?
---
Exclusive =/= Impressive. It’s still the award for who can spend the most time in game and is an unhealthy lifestyle.
---
yes.   Especially if you consider the time needed to get them.
---
as people replied to you, technically a few of those r10 pieces might be slightly better than t2,  the difference will only be like 1% .    If it takes  500 hours playtime (pvp)  compared to 50  hours  (PVE)  to get 1% better gear, I know what I will chose.
---
And btw, our PVE guild premade battleground teams usually stamped any opposite premade into the ground because the weapons and other gear of the PVE players usually are MUCH better than that of the pvp squad  (because almost none of them reach r13-14)
---
You *might* be able to solo Lyceum if you wait for 2x vanish 2x evasion/rush, but I'm fairly certain you can't solo Magmus, and absolutely no for emperor room.
---
then you read about not even lvl 60 characters raiding MC and i wonder why people even bother with bis
---
Plus 42 fire resist, which is nothing to sneeze at. Although I cringe to see more crafted gear to farm for.
---
Well I think it is pretty difficult to please adults who still need e-verification from strangers on their opinions on a website nobody would ever take serious in the first place.
---
On my first Onyxia I was kicked into the whelps.
---
I'm not even subscribed atm.
---
Or don't see the purpose of having an epic mount in pvp.
---
Firemaw PVP has decent balance.
---
&gt;Arenas are in roughly 2-3 years when bc comes out again. 
---
Who said anything about BC coming out
---
so what you going to use for pve then? trash blade? or you want to buy both and use one for pve one for pvp? not sure what youre talking about here the original question was about pve
---
There is a working version on the shaman discord.
---
You made the right choice. Warn / kick the whiner.
---
&gt;Or perhaps we can admit blizzard really fucked up a lot of easy things causing problems that were easily avoidable?
---
They were easily avoidable by playing retail.
---
This is vanilla.
---
**You signed up for this.**
---
People on PVP servers signed up for a month of being farmed like trash by the opposing faction.
---
- I told people a year ago you'd be farmed like trash and you'd hate it
---
And then when it finally happened: the last 3 weeks people have been complaining how horrible the honour system is. That they're being farm just like trash.
---
- I said wait for battlegrounds, and your inability to play the game because you're constantly did will stop, since people move to battlegrounds
---
Have people cried no this is different. This is much worse. We have to fix this now.
---
And then battlegrounds came out. And all the endless torment of people being farmed like trash has ended. Just like we all knew it would.
---
**This is what you signed up for**
---
- that gave that  you have Rose colored glasses
---
- or weren't around originally
---
Is nobody's problem except yours. if you don't like what it is: stop playing it.
---
There's a retail game just a drop-down away.
---
Are these required to kill Moira? I'm sorry, I haven't been that deep into BRD before.
---
Probably shouldn't aggro whilst we have no mana then.
---
Spinal Reaver or TuF for PVP as Enhancement? Got my TuF this week but if Spinal Reaver drops I may spend the EGDKP
---
The real answer is because the second raid usually comprises of less hardcore players who got to 60 later and don't take things as seriously. You often have attendance issues and a group of players not as concerned with speed running. If you started the game late and are in a second raid group and not enjoying the progression try being positive and helping organize and recruit instead of bitching about it or quit and find a guild with more serious players.
---
Being skilled enough to get into premades is a real thing.
---
if you get banned for playing a game within the limits of the game, you need to find a better game bruh
---
Faction balance was not "better than today" on most servers. You either got lucky and played on one of the very few balanced servers or were on the high pop faction so you didn't notice it.
---
A lot of people absolutely like the high pop servers. Before release tons of people were demanding super high pop because it's what they were used to from private servers.
---
There's basically only two "iterations" of MC and the first one was only played by a handful of players in the early months of the game (like March 2005, if I remember correctly). After Rag was nerfed (read: fixed, because he was basically unkillable in his bugged state) there were effectively no changes to MC, and that change was in like April 2005. The only thing that's changed since, other than class talents, which you already admitted would not have a huge impact on the zone, is that players actually know how the game works. That's it.
---
&gt;There are clear majorities on most things.
---
Lol.
---
I just bought mine and I'm essentially next in line for Perds. My reasoning is, even if Perds drops in my next raid and i replace Lobo immediately, well it helped against the first 9 bosses. Realistically, it probably won't drop in my next raid, so I'll likely get a few weeks of use out of it. I'm still undecided if I'm going to enchant it, though.
---
When you create imbalances it leads to this. Alliance would be doing the same thing if they had the numbers this is evident as they controlled many zones on my server and camped flight paths and dungeon entrances.
---
Lmfao what?
---
this has nothing to do with op and is basically just a weird and petty flex over something that isn't actually a problem for horde players
---
Yes. You can skip up to Lyceum but past that you actually need to do stuff.
---
Yeah, basically.  Horde have 2 choke points the alliance can't back door. The alliance have 0.
---
The hill north of Balinda, the alliance have to run up the road. The horde can stall there and pin the alliance. Vs the horde who can go around the bunker and jump off the hill and sneak the DB towers and gy.
---
Ali have to run threw a tiny tower to get into the RH. No back door. I've lost dozens of games stalled on that stupid hill, while a few dudes backdoor
---
Will recommend mograine too, great balance, there a lot of allies, IF is always full and always see allies in the open world
---
IDD people are saying it will get better when Rep grinders stop farming.
---
I hit exalter around 200k honor which is currently bracket 7 on my server. If you're lower that that, lack of rep grinders will make your life easier   
---
BUT everyone who's higher than 200k ish will have harder time because there will be less players in the pool  
---
Disclaimer 200k is my personal experience, actually honor average for rep grinders may vary
---
congratulations!  you spend 500 extra hours grinding for 5 SP and 1 crit!   And besides, the pve mage will STILL  have better overall stats because his neck/ weapon/ trinket / ring etc is FAR better than that of the hardcore rank 10 pvp player (because let's be honest, almost nobody reaches rank 13 or 14)
---
-banana man
---
Just unequip your pants
---
Why I dislike honor system. Less momments like this
---
Im using a 2013 MSi Gs70 stealth that's configured to all external stuff
---
1990s Aiwa oldschool stereo speakers, old Dell monitor and my Razer mouse and Keyboard i bought during Wrath.
---
Ashkandi represent
---
not their main dot, it says on the tooltip only one curse per warlock may be used on one target.
---
I bet if you bought the runes and kept a stack in your bag and traded the mage one for a portal that'd do the trick.
---
I chose tailoring and skinning and it was the best choice for me. I'm mage btw. Tailoring allowed me to gear up throughout the journey and skinning allowed me to sell a good amount of leather in the ah, making it easier to get my mount at 40.
---
You can also craft good items (for example bags) with leather, so tailoring-skinning is a good combo. At least until you get to 60, when you can reroll another profession (like engineering if you like pvp or alchemy if you like pve), but if you're a casual like me, you'll be ok with those 2.
---
Enable Vsync and then turn off Foreground FPS.
---
((You can leave Vsync off, but because this is the old client you can easily cause your GPU to 'whine' (aka Coil Whine) when it hits around 200+ FPS. So, with Vsync, it'll artificially limit the GPU's work to match the refresh rate of the monitor.))
---
Why is it not realistic? Even if one does it 20 min per run it's very good gold. Doesn't have to be perfect or anything. It just takes time to learn, but it's 100% worth it.
---
What I meant with my original comment was that there is no point in worrying about gold at that level as a Hunter. If gold is what OP is after, he/she is better of leveling to 60 (and end up with 200-250g in the process) and then start learning tributes.
---
Thank you so much for the links! Will check it out!
---
Most of the dungeon drops will be BoP but SFK actually has some really good 19 twink BoE blues
---
World on my server is non existent, we have trolls who put a password on it a few weeks after release and transfer ownership between each other once they get it
---
Thanks for putting the time into testing and following up. Super appreciate you doing the work for me to get better. Cheers!
---
You can use curses on more than 1 mob.
---
Do you think his question was, please tell me why discord is a better alternative to Communication in game? Because it wasn’t. Do you think he doesn’t know of discord or use it? Because anyone with half a brain can make the inference he’s trying to figure out how to use the Game chat over discord. 
---
A good analogy here would be some asking to use regular SMS messages in certain situations, over iMessages. Under normal circumstances would you ever prefer this, if you could use iMessages? No. Of course not. THAT DOESNT CHANGE THE QUESTION. He wants to know how to use SMS messages in the case, that he could benefit from the opportunity of knowing what and how to do it. You answered that hypothetical question with, “jUsT uSe IMEsSageS.” Well thanks for your input there killer, but that’s not the question being asked. Ergo, dense.
---
You can farm a lot, actually, but go for non-caster mobs. 
---
I regularly farm lashers in DM:E, stockades, deadmines, SFK, undead in WPL and you can also farm SM.
---
There are quite a few youtube-videos concerning this... Try searching for Roly the Holy, Quissy or the father of AoE-farming Wowhobbs. They are all nice, down to earth and informative.
---
And it's really great fun... Thankfully
---
Because tanks are haaard to find. And I can sneak my way there.
---
Happy to help : )

Frozenfire?

Only on Alliance side.  The "everyone queue on a timer" trick for premade AV only works with instant queues, so Horde can't do that.  Solo queueing, the vast bulk of what differentiates brackets is games played.  Are there gains to be made hunting kills in AV?  Sure, and I suspect the top rankers are doing just that, but those gains are tiny in the face of the bonus honor from just playing another game.  Would not surprise me at all to find that people realistically aiming for rank 12+ are playing and hunting for kills (even though that's harder when queuing solo) for X hours a day, and using an AFK bot the other hours of the day just to keep up with others aiming for high ranks while they sleep, eat, etc.
---
Great video impressive! You using sapper charges?
---
Is that your defense for botting? Jokes aside, you will know when someone is botting and when someone is not. Is it for Blizzard to decide which route they are going to take although the problem right now is that they are not taking any route.
---
Still doesn’t make sense he went from revered to exalted in 34 games. That’s 617 rep/game including the losses. I got about 600 per win which included killing galv, winning, and turning in the quest item for 100 rep
---
Funny, got way more honor/hr doing 'drek rushes' than trying to take out Galv...which usually ends up being a 50+ minute AV match.
---
&gt; future expansions
---
Ok we are talking about an expansion (Classic+) that happens after Classic, and way before WoD, in a different timeline. What happened in Legion has no bearing on what has to happen in another timeline (Classic+).
---
I think its because the more hardcore raiders might have chosen Alli for the slight over advantage
---
Thank you! I had no idea
---
15 mins would be nice but 30-50 min for oceanic kinda sucks tbh.
---
I have seen a lot of warriors with it, not sure why they go for it besides that it looks cool. But for Paladins, it is very nice, I can easily end up healing 500+ hp from procs in big pulls.
---
Would that mean it's easier to rank up on a PvE server? since you have less people contesting in your faction?
---
Awesome thanks I was trying to find stuff on YouTube but I guess my searches were bad I’ll check them out
---
This bonus is awesome.
---
But as Shadow you'll be the lowest priority. Pray RNG mate, you shouldn't have switched before at least having the 2 available pieces atm.
---
I mean on my server there isn't much WPVP within 15 mins of the FP for you, but go you man. Enjoy being part of the talentless horde zerg against people leveling. Cheers!
---
I will try the lasher farms, thank you
---
Regarding tailoring, as far as I know holy priest are only interested in the truefaith vestments, and I'm still farming those comps... But I think after this nothing else is needed in tailoring so I will follow you advice and swap it for herbs
---
Low quality ingame models. They have to be built from scratch by *content* creators
---
people are gonna have SGC long before they grind out either rank needed for the PVP chest
---
I'm having a blast. I hit exalted with Frost Wolves and the last half of my Rep grind was longer, way more enjoyable games and the queue timer made it feel a lot less hectic. Not sure what gave you the impression I'm not enjoying it
---
More like PVPers think Galv and Lieutenants give more honor than actually winning the match in under 10 minutes.
---
...ya know, instead of a 50+ minute AV match that tends to result in Horde winning.
---
\-\_-'
---
You're problematic. Sir.
---
That's a good thing, the worse honor per hour AV is, the more likely WSG to become the best BG for honor is.

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ebvux6/8_hour_down_time/).

How to calculate how unlucky that is?
---
Please correct me if I am wrong:
---
If you don't get it once the probability is 
---
(1-p) 
---
p in that case should be 0.07 (7%), source WOWHead.
---
If you don't get it twice the probability is
---
(1-p) x (1-p)
---
(You diden't get it the first time AND you diden't get it the second time... AND P is multiplied)
---
So if you don't get it 257 runs it is (1-p) x (1-p) .... x (1-p) 257 times.
---
(1-p)\^257
---
That is about 7,9454368154 x 10 \^ -9
---
Or in other words the chances are 1 : 125 858 404 for this to happen.
---
Is that right? That would be very very unlucky to a grade I can not think of.
---
Let's calculate that for the 591 runs claimed in another posting here.
---
That would be 1 : 423 230 935 755 1912 417
---
Those numbers are far from reality in my opinion.
---
1) I can be wrong and my calculation is wrong. Then please correct me where I am wrong.
---
2) Those guys have some kind of special unluck that is incredible on a galactic scale.
---
3) The droprates from wowHead are wrong
---
4) The random calculation of Blizzard is not correct.
---
I think it might just be (3)... The droprate in classic was about 15% according to old data.
---
Did they reduce it somewhere? Is there an entry in a patchnote that they did this?
---
Well, I don't know about you, but it feels like Lawbringer, Felheart and Cenarion have an exceptionally high drop rate compared to others, while the headcounts of Paladin, Warlock and Druid in a regular raid are very few. It's not fair.
---
No. They are playing BGs for fun with friends. If they wanted Honor, they would be in AV. It is obvious that a premade group in WSG isn't in there for honor. The only obvious answer is they enjoy coordinated PvP. Shocking I know that not everyone feels like playing with random people who do random things.
---
&gt;you will know when someone is botting and when someone is not
---
I mean, the fact that I get so many messages just because I grind or fish a lot tells me that no, people don't know when someone is botting and when they aren't.
---
Same with Gehennas sometimes. That's on them though, nothing that prevents you and I from making it a better place :)
---
If you know what you're doing the Rep rate per hour isn't much different than it was the first few days of AV
---
fury warrior with titan grip here...bring your homie
---
Not really. In my experience they are -1000 morale. Give a boomkin a staff of dominance and monitor your mages moral. Let me know how that goes.
---
Thank you! I willl try farming the lashers, I'm keeping tailoring for the moment, still farming some comps for the truefaith vestement, but once I'm done with that I think nothing else is interesting in tailoring as a holy priest, so I will swap it for herbs
---
Definitely this. People need to dial back their min/max and obsession
---
In Muad'Dib's name.
---
Use 3 pc black dragonscale (skip legs for devilsaur) and the trinket from DM Tribute.
---
&gt; I was tempted to go for the rank 14 grind but then realised that any of the gear I would earn would be invalidated by PvE gear months later.
---
This is actually not the case and the reason why a lot of minmaxers are grinding rank 14.  If the gear was invalidated with BWL most people wouldn't bother with it outside of the masochists.  Because the spellblade is released (which should've been phase 6), casters have the option to get a weapon which is equivalent to the bis mainhand from viscidus in AQ40 and won't be replaced until Maexxna's Wraith Blade.
---
Warriors and Rogues use their HWL/GM weapons and pieces of their R12/13 set long into AQ, human warriors I know keep GM swords until MSA and rogues hold onto their swords for just as long.
---
The people ranking right now only do so so they can perform better in PvE and gearstomp people in worldpvp.  There is no "prestige" or "I like pvp" mentality with most of them.
---
I only recall short bursts of rep and it often occurs when I'm not even near a battle, so I'm pretty sure it's only from turn-ins
---
Done about 100 runs. had it drop on my very first run, hunter ninja'd it. Someday... ..I will get this on my war :(
---
It's literally BIS in some guides to tank too eh because the threat? It's not even just good for dps, its good all round :/
---
&gt; from feeds for a variety of reasons, including keeping communities safe, civil, and true to their purpose.  
---
&gt;Hi there,
---
When someone is grinding his way killing mobs you can see the difference. Fishing is indeed tricky.
---
Hand of Justice is a myth. It does not drop.
---
When I Q for AV in alterac I head to WPL and pick herbs, every time I go up river I see two (sometimes three) dead unskinnable tortoises, always in the same spot near where the zones change over. Super weird.
---
Don't send your pets in if you value their safety. My felhunter dies in seconds, so I keep him by my side and send him to fight any opposing faction casters that join the fray with a mouseover macro.
---
like AT ALL - first few quests hint how they dont like theri allies and then you start researching a plague to KILL EVERYTHING IN AZEROTH.
---
So you basically want all Horde to win trade with Alliance?  Because they aren't letting you farm honor/rep in a zerg fashion?  Because they would rather try to play the actual game?
---
That’s insane
---
&gt;- Go to MC with 16 ret pallys
---
- Ragnaros submerged because DPS isn't high enough
---
- Healers run out of mana because the fight was too long
---
- ~~Wipe~~ Bubble-hearth
---
-blame wow for badly designing a class 15 years ago
---
Suddenly kkk
---
I'd like to say so too, but it's probably selection bias.
---
A slow wep speed will still not reach your maximum ppm 100% of the time. A fast wep insures max ppm, even when missing a higher than avg amount of auto attacks
---
You sound like a dick dude calm the fuck down
---
no
---
Eventually HoJ is supposed to drop off emperor, I think we will see an uptick in people running it then. I heard it was supposed to be this patch but don't think it was done so who knows when they will put that in.
---
That sounds prety good for me and way what would be easy to lvl. On my main i took mining and blacksmithing and found it hard to keep my mining on decent lvl, also realised that i also took blacksmithing when i was lvl 40 or something. But that was my very first time playing whole game.
---
With a queue that long you can set your hearth to your farming/questing location of choice, re-queue after a match and hearth to get stuff done while you wait
---
no we didnt. i hit rank 14 in vanilla and it was always "who nolifed it the most"
---
Umm.. I sure wish this were true. Looking forward to never queuing up for AV ever again. WSG so much more fun.
---
Same, he ninja'd it off me, a warrior. T\_T
---
It's kinda harsh as shadow since all shadow talents are useless (unless you have spirit tap, I think it procs off skeletons? not sure though).
---
Grab dynamite if engineer, oil of immolation and stratholme holy water to deal with skeletons. Wear high int/healing gear and use downranked heals (I think I was using renew 7 and flash heal 4, not sure though). Prioritize removing diseases, especially the purple one. Get an addon to show debuffs over friendly health bars, I used threat plates.
---
I recorded myself doing it, it was pretty messy and I was mostly wanding the skeletons.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4RFHaD8Z0U
---
It’s all about the rep. The fast queues allows alliance to effectively form premades which reward way more honor/rep per hour than any solo queue player can hope to achieve.
---
You'd rather tank without the most OP talent in the game making defense irrelevant, a very strong defensive CD and 15% threat over keeping 25 rage when stance dancing?
---
Aye 17/34 has better threat than deep prot, but that's cause deep prot sucks as all the goodies are early. a 17/34 doesn't hold a candle to 32/19 however.
---
You shouldn't be using Whirlwind or Overpower at all anyhow, Zerker stance and Battle stance have an innate 0,8 threat modifier whilst defiance talented defensive stance has 1.55, simply put dealing a 1000 crit in zerker stance gives you 800 threat, a 1000 crit in defensive stance gives you 1,550 threat. Overpower also shares CD with Revenge and should never be used in a tanking scenario.
---
The utility you lose out on with Tactical Mastery are two things, Intercept and Mocking Blow. Like I mentioned in my original post planning ahead with bloodrage and having mighty rage potions in your inventory is more than plenty to cover any situation where you'd have to use either ability.
---
Why would you waste potential rage from stance dancing instead of just equipping a shield to shield bash?
---
Sure if it's not fun by all means, but us tanks have, contrary to popular belief not the job of staying alive - that's the healers job. Our job is outputting maximum threat.
---
And Shamans &gt;.&gt;
---
I imagine the meme-specs will be in for a rude awakening once AQ hits and nobody wants to raid with them anymore.
---
This 200 IQ genius here.
---
300k gets me into bracket 10 this week
---
Nah it says you can't place different curses on the same target. But you can place how many single curses on how many targets you want.
---
Funny, I've experienced so many games where Horde just don't defend at all, whereas Alliance sends skirmish parties to every freaking bunker and turtle at Balinda.
---
I use Bagnon but just found Adibags the other day. I prefer Adi in terms of organization, but I greatly miss being able to check the bags and bank of my other toons :/
---
1. Run out from cave.
---
2. Use trinket.
---
3. Hide behind drek building.
---
When horde look at map you look like a loyal defence man.
---
This is my setup. The 42 fr is also helpful in current raid content.
---
Okay sounds good! I do more research about herb to see what i can do with it.
---
Me, you heard it here first.
---
Another way to avoid turtles is to queue at the same time as a buddy or two. People generally leave turtles 1 at a time, so if you get 3 people to pop the same AV it’s almost certainly fresh.
---
Literally what I've been doing with my rogue alt with mining!
---
Kinda sucks when you go through an arcane crystal drought.
---
It doesn’t matter. The surge in players is due to AV rewards. Many people will die down, some are going hard on top of exalted because they think they will rank up an astronomical amount which they won’t. Once they realize that they need to do that again and weren’t very interested in ranking to begin with, they will say fuck it and continue to raid for gear. People will get bored of AV.
---
and? maybe all of us are not doing BGs purely for honor!  Maybe we want to stop you in all you objectives. If Queue times go up, so be it!
---
when you spawn at the middle gy at field of strife, wait until no one is around and run behind a tree as a ghost
---
I think so.   Idk of a single guild doing a proper split raid.
---
He reason ally give up is they know if they hearth back to stop the horde then game is going to last an hour
---
Definitely would have for the mage I leveled with, at least. He just didn't always have the runes on him.
---
Warrior hitting mage once KEKW
---
omg THIS.
---
The smaller caps and server only BGs were what made the game memorable. Rivalries between guilds was the BEST in Vanilla. Coming up against a 10 man premade from a known raiding guild was always a challenge.
---
And yes, everyone min-maxing has made the game boring (xp/hour, honor/hour).
---
WSG is how I remember it, and I love it. I just don't have the time to invest like I did in college.  And my handful of WSG games, can't compete with the endless stream of AV speed runs that everyone and their mom is doing right now.
---
GearMenu works better in my experience.
---
this must be an US thing, whenever I join a guild with auto invite the only thing being said each hour is "welcome" and then silence
---
My raid 2, or "raid B" clears MC in 3 hours. Our main raid does it in an hour and a half. The difference is raid 2 is everyone's alts and overflow from raid 1 or core raiders that missed the tuesday raid. Sometimes we have to 5 or 10 people to fill and sometimes our dps is a little slow and cant 1 phase rag. Sometimes we wipe on rag once or twice because of that but we eventually clear all the content. &lt;Echelon&gt; Fairbanks horde
---
Doing 600 DPS while cleaving helps immensely. It's basically how I tank most trash in 5 mans. I switch to proper tanking for bosses and certain hard hitting mobs.
---
I actually saw one last night for the first time.  By the air elementals in Silithus.  Darker elementals showed up along with a level 60 elite one.
---
It’s actually super easy to do dungeons as fury prot, lots more damage I don’t see a reason to change specs, also noticed if you do it right you can just keep everything on you while DWing I don’t see a reason to switch back and forth
---
Wait you can?
---
Yeah, mining nodes are not very easy to find while leveling. Skinable mobs instead, are in every zone. I'm 46 and have 294/300 skinning.
---
in my experience it's alliance allways turtle at the hill behind balinda and horde always tend to zerg in mid helping no one
---
imagine thinking it's not, private servers had passion as a motive, Blizzards classics is garbage in comparison to the blood sweat and tears of the nost team + years of community development towards classic.
---
The only way this affects you is that ally will finish their Rep grind sooner and horde queues will keep increasing. The amount of Honor they get in an individual game has no direct impact on you. At some point it will level off, I predict 2-3 weeks max and queue times will stabilize as the PvE players get their epics. But through all of this if you're grinding Honor the longer queues mean you can push wpvp in between matches to maximize Honor and get an edge against people actually in your bracket
---
Ranking doesn't require skill. That said, skill comes with experience naturally.
---
 Every High Warlord / Grand Marshal will be good at pvp.
---
at level 40, you're struggling to solo other instances higher than SFK.  But at level 40, you should just concentrate on questing onwards. You need to be pretty lucky in SFK to get the BOE drops which get you great gold.
---
Take your time but please do it fast
---
So which is it?
---
Looking at long term potential I believe WoW2/Classic+ would be the smarter idea versus going BC &gt; Wrath &gt; dead game.
---
I agree that Drillborer is better but I can't raid since I'm on server time +6. Even then, I feel too old to dedicate 3 hours of an evening to WoW. Generally only have energy in the morning/midday.
---
What if I don’t give a shit about honor and just want to play the game?
---
Y’all are fucking dictators.
---
Not really though.
---
While your answer is 100% based on imagination, some people could have insight into Pserver history, with drop off rates etc and make a qualified guess based on those assumptions. Its still only speculations, but its based out of something.
---
&gt;I'll defer to you until proven otherwise. 
---
Still deferred, not sure what else there is to say.
---
Holy fuck the entitlement
---
undead mage being a cunt, whats new
---
Pro tip: let the healers know. As a PVE priest I will stick to you like glue.
---
He needs to go hard on consumes and probably get an innervate to compete. Shadow just goes oom so fast doing their max dps rotation.
---
Don't macro it, just keybind it and use it when you know you will get the full power out of it
---
bandicaM
---
&gt;  Also literally 0 eyes of divinity. NOTHING but hunter leaf since our first clear.
---
that is crazy
---
You also get gold. The question is "Is the pay off worth it?" Yes you might make friends or you might just hard carry a bunch of people though an instance and never even see them again
---
On the bright side do you know how much Netflix I get to watch while in queens and in match it’s insane.
---
I joined these guilds on my alt hunter, and quickly left both.   I have heard similar stories about several other guilds on the server though.  Idk anyone that does a proper split raid.   Even 10 A team members is a bit light, but at least you can summon rag.
---
No zug zug.
---
Succ succ.
---
I log out and reset on my alt :) leader transfers in about a min.
---
r/usernamechecksout
---
Dude. Let’s talk about this..on discord.
---
There's zero chance of classic+ and wow2 isn't going to happen when they already have 3 expansions planned for retail.
---
The unprecedented amount of ganking in p2 is the result of Blizzard changes. 5x more server pop and dropping the honor system when a lot of people were stacked up in raid gear did not happen in vanilla.
---
Do you know if its possible to see mana use / OOM stats on warcraft logs?
---
Because he never once complained about being OOM.
---
&gt; We know as Horde that we would have a bit of a time to wait in queue to av. 
---
That's funny, cuz on day 1, I got told I was a "bozo" for saying that horde would have a queue time. Has the furor petered out now that the Alliance that were queue-ing for rep are exalted?
---
yeah i feel dirty getting HoJ and Glad in ~30 BRD runs total.
---
Alliance - “We want insta q’s AND insta wins! “ 
---
Horde - “We just want to win.”
---
If you bought SOZ and mass, and enchanted both with crusader you'd pay less than just buying a krol blade and not enchanting it. Thinking is hard
---
Maybe quite young? Unemployed?
---
Atlas Loot says phase 5 is when HoJ appears in the Emperor's loot table, but I'm not sure how where they got that info/how accurate that is.
---
At 55 I would recommend having PI so it's easier :) but as long as you have more than 6k mana it should be fine :) just remember renew and stam buff.
---
Problem is the hunter could be making 100g/hr doing DMT instead of helping you.
---
significant figures.
---
you are reporting sub picosecond precision in a game that has tens of millisecond latency. you should report your results to the nearest second at best.
---
10^-14 seconds (the time you claim precision to have measured) is how long it takes for light to travel across the width of a human hair.
---
I am here for the rep. I dont care about your horde pvp butthurts that you have worse way to Vanndar and are turtling it.. arent even capable to push under 40 mins now. Learn to play or don´t turtle at all.
---
btw you dont need to put shazzrah (horde), theres no alliance on the server
---
I farmed my rank 11 back in Vanilla with my server 24/7 premade group. Most of these wanna be 14 rank were terrible at the game.
---
But then you have to outdps the dps. Just tank and let the dps do their thing.
---
Pserver dropoff rates and realm transfers, that doesn't sound very applicable but what do I know. One could point to the fact that they were introduced in Vanilla about 5-6 months before TBC hit, which is at least somewhat solid.
---
But as you point out as well, it's only speculations as history does not dictate the future - and I am frankly getting a bit tired of seeing this pointless question thrown around (as you probably can tell), as there is no real answer. We simply do not know. As such, my guess is still firmly centered on 4.2 unicorns.
---
Why is this being down voted? Simple genuine question.
---
What goblin stuf do you use btw?

---
If you want honor just go to all the bodies of water and kill all the afk fisherman 🤷🏼‍♀️
---
Can I be calm?
---
15 mins is nothing compared to corpse running for 30 mins to do any instance when phase 2 came out with no BGs.
---
Its also nothing compared to the 30 min queues we had in Vanilla on our server.
---
Like you said, its nice being alliance in classic. : )
---
20k honor an hour feelsgoodman
---
Confirms what I already knew to be the case from my own experience.  If a game is sub 15mins it is overwhelmingly likely to be a loss.  If it is over 20mins it is overwhelmingly likely to be a win.
---
Would have been even more interesting if you had recorded bonus honor, HK's, and rep for each of those games, so that we could confirm my other suspicion, namely that longer games, and therefore wins, are better for both honor and rep.
---
At the front of the horde entrance cave or the horde fishing pool.
---
Always a couple horde afk / fishing for free kills.
---
25k honor an hour feelsgoodman
---
Im in raid 2 of my guild and we got server first  flawless ony kill lol. "Chillers" - felstriker
---
Fury prot is great threat but by no means necessary. My guild urs are geared as fuck and I have absolutely no issues with threat as deep prot.
---
You just need to know how to hold threat. Use Force Reactive Disk on AOE fights, use concussion blows on any stragglers, and drop a dense dynamite at the start of a fight. Have had no issues at all holding threat with that.
---
New frogs PepeLaugh

Summon friends, hard spell 😉

I would think it would show in Resources tab but it doesn't seem functional. What is his ratio of mind blast to mind flat ticks?
---
Do hunters have any actual bis until aq from pvp gear?
---
Team Hat all day
---
Indeed, they are targeting you specifically. It is known.
---
I don’t know go to Darnassus or actually queue from the entrance portal?
---
You’re choosing to be miserable here.
---
Sure, but they probably would have done some class balance changes in 1.12 if they didn't know they'd be bringing out TBC pre patch as well.
---
I'm a holy priest and I can't stand that every time I join AV, it's a dice toss on whether someone is there to heal. I inspect a full epic tank warrior, decide to follow him and... he goes fishing.   
---
Not being able to queue AV by even a group of 5 really fucking sucks for non-solo class builds.
---
ITs not like flamelash people all logged out out the transferred servers and KEPT PLAYING. So they obviously are having fun with the game despite their server situation which no one really has any control over.
---
Okay that's interesting because I actually heard this is how it works for shadow. How did you guys test it?
---
Only ignorant people believe killing galv and LTs causes you to lose. I’d have many games won in 10 minutes killing galv LTs and then drek. I’ve also had many games where we rush drek and lose in 25 minutes
---
Rushing Drek is always bad because horde split the raid, the nearest GY is behind mid honor farmers and by the time the 15 people who have epic mounts and didn't get caught by horde make it to RH the horde just recall back and camp drek/push from tunnel.
---
 Until Ally start defending and actually doing objectives like towers and galv/lts they will start to lose more and more as more horde figure out how easy it is to stop the Ally zerg.
---
It's not a choice between losing in 50 minutes with Galv and Lieutenants and winning in 10. It's a choice between getting honor from Galv and Lieutenants and losing, and getting blocked at Drek and losing with nothing to show for it.
---
Not giving you shit for logs buddy all you’ll do is be more elitist about it based on your other comments here. I explained how I hold threat, don’t believe me? I don’t care honestly. I use consumables and Force Reactive Disk with Thorium Shield Spike - no issues yet.
---
Go look up top tanks on most servers, even though top 10 are fury prot (not denying that it’s better threat), prot tanks are still in top 20 range - it’s not impossible.
---
Furthermore, to your comment about people getting boned out of one of their FIVE DAYS to play, I can only say grow the fuck up. People with normal day jobs, kids, activities, and other responsibilities (myself and plenty of others) can find time to log in and enjoy the game, you can live with the minor inconvenience.
---
That means you can only use curse of Agony (for example), but you can cast curse of Agony on 5 targets. 
---
You CANT cast curse if Agony AND curse of exhaustion. At the same time.
---
To level
---
Combat swords
---
This is due to way better swords being available to you via quest rewards vs dungeon drops. 
---
For pvp
---
Daggers but your going to have to work for them. 
---
PvE
---
Its a mix of what BiS you can get first. 
---
Daggers will will out do swords but are much harder to get 😕

Complete a BRD quest to get the recipe, then spend a ridiculous amount of time farming gold/ mats to craft it--

---
&gt; The fact that we have a better 'Classic AV' on retail currently says it all.
---
That largely depends on who you ask though. I really liked old AV and I'm loving it on retail atm. Others don't. I also don't know what the current win rate on classic is, but from my experience in retail old av, it's currently like 9/10 horde wins. (over 100 games on both factions by now)
---
... every 'top tank' on warcraft logs is fury prot.
---
guys, please. it's winterveil!
---
Is there any of those guilds on Pagle?  
---
I stopped playing a while ago because I felt so left behind and if I could find other levelers that would be so nice, and I could play again :D
---
T2 helms are the easiest items in the game and having T2 leggings on everyone is probably good RNG.  As for the rest of your questions I don't touch shadow spec so i can't really help you, but i've never seen anyone talk about using T2 3p as shadow while i've seen people praising mp5 gear on them, so take that how you want.
---
Wrong. Kill galv, LTs and drek all in 10 minutes for 3k honor. Just have to have a coordinated team™️
---
Well, I was never in the No Changes camp. Vanilla is by no means perfect and could use a lot of improvements (which is why it was improved by TBC back in the day), feels silly to not do it to fulfill some dogmatic rule.
---
This literally made me thinking about canceling. I am a casual player but wanted to do some PVP to get gear I can't from MC/Ony (we have a lot of palas in the guild), but it seems impossible. Too bad, maybe ill wait a few months until things settle. Great post though, thanks for it.
---
games been out for 15 years, still clicks
---
Very true
---
This is too accurate 😂
---
Horde don't rush fast enough that you lose by doing lieutenants and commanders. It's just that ally fucks up the warmaster pulls way to often by that one person being up there that shouldn't be, afking at frostwolf Gy, or refusing to push into their base. And then by the time they decide to push horde has already destroyed towers and pulled marshals even though ally has a few minutes advantage
---
Back stab is shit unless your crit is high or if you have cold blood popped, otherwise I'd rather vanish and use my CB for ambush or cheapshot and get those extra combo points and do a 5 point evisc for much more damage. Backstab is kind of useless IMO. It has its moments but it costs 60 energy and if you're not on a clothy it's pretty pointless.
---
Get into the premade AV discord and there’s zero problems and it’s an easy turtle-buster too. Horde have very low % chance of winning. At least when I ran them it was easy exalted. The geared tanks are probably not queueing anymore though. Not sure, I’m done with that shot show myself too.
---
[Removed for low effort](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e23ye6/wow_classic_in_a_nutshell_atm/)
---
What does that do? You didn’t explain anything
---
That's not enough time to get anywhere or do anything.
---
Snu snu.
---
Which if classic is any indication, they've shown little initiative beyond reverse engineering it
---
Yea they should really let us 5 man queue.
---
The pool won't be much smaller on PvP servers. The PvE'ers hitting huge honor to get exalted with AV are very likely to stay in the pool and get 15 HK's per week. They still do Dire Maul, Strath/Scholo, UBRS etc and will run into world PvP. Aside from that, many are still going to casually be doing WSG to start getting rep for the sick PvE rewards to be added in later phases. And as a PvE'er getting decent honor from WSG is hard.
---
Imagine being this insecure that you have to shit on people taking something seriously.
---
He doesn't know.
---
nice wrap man
---
Prot is worse at holding threat on 3+ mobs than Arms and that's pretty much what all 5 mans are. Stay Arms until right before your first raid then you can respec to fury.
---
I guess you don't know what inclined means? No worries, my point is that people that play PVP servers usually will be more focused on playing PVP and doing it effectively. And therefore they will create pre-mades more often then people playing on a PVE server. It doesn't really matter that PVE server can do something as well. I'm sure they will. But it will be done less in comparison.

Warlords Silk Cowl, General's Silk Handguards, General Silk Trousers, General's Silk Boots, Warlords Silk Raiment, High Warlord's Spellblade. 
---
I don't have tailoring so no Robe of the Archmage, which is why the Warlords Silk Raiment, using Winter Night atm.
---
Will be revered today, but only level 56, so can't even wear it for a bit. Got my last two levels in AV, prob just keep doing that and a few dungeons to get the rest of the stuff I need.
---
EXACTLY THIS
---
That would cost 5000 gold on my server
---
Oh don't get me wrong I fully agree with you. I was just under a potentially false impression that the majority of the Classic playerbase wanted, nay, demanded the no changes policy...warts n' all.
---
it's more of a '' give a noob an answer for his question, he'll finish his quest... teach a noob how to google, he'll finish every quest'' type of deal.
---
and this is also why I don't join them anymore.
---
What's the dumbest reason you make significant changes to your character? I'm making my pvp Warrior Fury because getting back to back dual wield crits makes the monkey sitting at the computer inside my brain happy. And because Orc Fury Warriors are the most aesthetic class/race combo in the game.
---
I paused at 49 to run WSG and get my trinket and I have to say, it's been a ton of fun. Haven't run into a single twink (doesn't really make sense at 49) and the matches have been really even. I know it's a vacuum, but I was pleasantly surprised.
---
I really enjoyed reading this rant, thanks OP!
---
Think he's saying the guy who submitted the video is just a witness, so telling him to stop doing something he wasn't doing isn't necessary
---
Go send Activision-Blizzard a letter, with a request to change their weekly maintenance schedule just for you.  
---
Or.... you can realize that the company actually does that on a time slot that consist the lowest number of players and dont be a bitch about it, like the grown up you supposed to be
---
Then roll alliance. Everyone knew that horde will have long queue for pvp.
---
&gt;how much your developers haven't altered the game
---
There have been massive changes since day 1, what do you mean?
---
The problem is Alliance keeps using same tactics from first day of AV but we need too start adapting.
---
Just bound it haha. wasnt a priority yet barly pvped havnt really raided yet for me to worry abou it  
---
ShiftX
---
What about the people who aren't insane about min/maxing honour? And just want to log on and do 1 wsg/av before bed? I'd rather have instant queues than 15 min wait times
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/server/rankings/5060/1000#metric=dps&amp;class=Warrior&amp;spec=Protection
---
Prot Tanks crack top 30 in my server with pretty decent dps. Like I said, it’s not impossible.
---
I'm loving AV. Maybe you just don't know what fun is?
---
That's just not true. There were tons of 60s before TBC.
---
Ah, you have two accounts?
---
For sure, if you're not killing at least 2-3 fire elementals per run then you're missing out on a ton of gold
---
drive the alliance away from AV and into WSG?
---
sounds good to me.
---
Once it dries up, you can still make the elixir. 
---
You can make 600g in a out 30 days of selling easy. 
---
Just undercut and make side deals with mages to avoid AH cut of the revenue.
---
If you think premades are a new thing Ive got bad news for ya chief.
---
Sapper charges are amazing
---
Lol reddit is pathetic
---
Vanish.
---
That's not true. If you face a 40 man russian stack, they will always go to vandaar without taking any other objective and finish the game in 8 minutes. If you face them, you can still beat em by going to drek. But you gotta be quick.
---
No, I have my friend invite both of my characters to a group then he leaves :)
---
That windows game recorder killed FPS on my pc and they enable it by default. I think it was the in game overlay.
---
or go play the game, you jackass, you are part of a problem, dont ask for help here !
---
Was in a pug mc MS&gt;OS with a soft reserve. OEB dropped, not a single roll. There was another warrior that had a shitty 2h from BRD or something. Asked him why he didn't roll, he was hoping for a rag 2h and didn't want to waste his roll. I was like dude, thats a serious upgrade to not take on the chance a rag weapon drops (it didn't) and you win against several other rollers.
---
More of a problem is in dungeons like Zul Farak, Maraudon or BRD. The runs inside toward the place of wiping are long enough as is, but with this handicap, damn.
---
So it’s 7 vs 28?  4 times? If 5 went to the enemy mine, that’s still worth 20 of yours.
---
Leaving 8 more trips to yours.  that’s not bad
---
You're right. Blizzard employees should have their schedules cater to you.
---
I don't mind the current BGs but the idea that someone can look at the way they did the launch of classic, with rolling more servers out in a panic with huge populations and even larger queue times, implementing non-faction specific transfers during the queues which utterly fucked up the way different types of players are distributed in servers, picking and choosing what things to change (and there have been changes, server population and itemization among them), what versions of things to use from what parts of vanilla and then say "Oh hey this is exactly vanilla and you're just a big dumb who has the rose tinted goggles that's why you're upset" is disingenuous at best.
---
Y'all do what you want, I'm going to fish.
---
Well you could try earlier but remember theres more mobs down there not just lashers :) you might have a huge aggro range.
---
Since the queues are region wide where is a good place to join the premades?
---
Yes, I hit exalted but kept on going for more honor and the Horde definitely changed the meta into a turtle meta. Games used to be 7-14 minutes, now they are 25-40. But Alliance are adapting to meta and also sending groups to defend which make it just as hard for the horde. The thing is, though, that premade AV is easy to organize for alliance easy queues, and premade alliance games still win in 10-15 minutes if there's enough of them and they know what to do.
---
I think you can do /trinket reset too but i m stuck at work all day today so cant test it.
---
The warrior set has a severe lacking of threat stats, especially hit rating, which is your most important stat for holding threat.
---
I also like to help alliance when I'm questing in a zone. 
---
Except when they are rogues, rogues die no matter which level they are.
---
pickup enchanting and level it to 300 and get most bis endgame enchants. Easiest 1g of your life when everyone wants to tip that for crusader.
---
Fuck off.
---
Ya, that is a great plan dude. Try to be flexible with when you spec prot though. If you decide you want to spend 50-60 in dungeons, then spec earlier if you wish.
---
My guild only gets druid drops in MC for some reason, and has only seen a single weapon. Been killing rag since week four as well.
---
Have you read the 8 pc T1 set bonus for shamans? It's insane.
---
I see, after your alt has reset, can you login on main straight away or do you have to wait 1 min before logging back in?
---
This is incredible. Brings so much more life to this epic saga. Thank you.
---
Cropping is the process of cutting out extra portions of an image in order to focus the viewer's attention on the most relevant, important, or aesthetically pleasing part of the image. In this case, over 90% of your image is relaying completely unnecessary information. If you had cropped the image to just the item tooltip along with the section showing the rolls, the information you were trying to relay would be more immediately obvious to your viewers.
---
The other poster insisting you "ignore me" was telling you to ignore genuinely helpful criticism.
---
our first raid team clear MC in 1H15, give or take.
---
our second team clear MC in 1H30, they have more casters and can't chain pull as efficiently.
---
our third raid team cleared MC in 2 hour last time...
---
i'd say it's mostly balanced.
---
Got 15 wins in a row as Horde, and now 19 wins in 20 games.
---
Most pieces are for mitigation set, but gloves for instance are good for both iirc.
---
It's funny how this is a meme but I remember this episode. Poor morph
---
Warlocks coming in the clutch yet again
---
I'm not sure why you people are being so naive? Of course Blizzard have backups of every single version of World of Warcraft. You're crazy to think otherwise. It's stored and easily accessible, but 1.12 was the patch that required least work to replicate and Blizzard only had easy choices to make.
---
If Blizzard chose an earlier version, they would have much harder choices in terms of content release, item changes, etc.
---
1.12 was the easy way out (which I agree with), but of course they have backups of every version they ever released....
---
its a Horde VS Alliance battle and you complain about the Tactic of the other faction.  
---
Yeah right, either huge troll post , or huge lack of brain.
---
Hit cap is the same for both weapons in pvp
---
I've been AE'ing zombies through my 40s and the only thing that limits my pull size is the initial hits I take when I cancel block and frostnova... often I take 0 damage but sometimes they get a round where it feels like I just get locked out of nova for a second. What exactly is the macro just /cancelaura then /cast?
---
What is better in the OH for PvE Combat Rogue: The Lobotomizer or Mirah's Song?
---
The best part is the swing timer hahaha
---
I am genuinely enjoying the shifting AV metas, the fact that it's never the same game twice (for me at least), and the fact that as a resto druid there's a lot of things I can do to contribute and I can pick what I want to do each time.
---
I have an Acer Swift 3 (i5) and I can play on low settings. I don't think anything less than an i5 will manage.
---
You basically NEED to have over 6k mana... I'm running it on my priest with 6.2k mana and it uses every single bit of my mana.
---
How deep are the lakes where people fish? Warlocks could cast Unending Breath and dive to the bottom :D
---
Firemaw is basically Gehennas but as balanced as it gets (55-45ish Horde favoured).
---
And conversely having que times is only good for the hardcore no lifer. Currently no lifing is easier as horde and casual is easier as alliance. I'm jealous.
---
If you want to AOE grind. Something like this would work:   [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sqxu0gcZVGxcMzx](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sqxu0gcZVGxcMzx) 
---
Reckoning will be going off a lot because you should be getting crit-hit a decent amount of the time. 
---
Conc seems to have a chance to proc Judgement of Light and Wisdom on the first tick, **for each mob hit with an active judgment of light or wisdom**. So, Judge a bunch and grab a fast weapon (I recommend Linken's Sword). Then just tab-target spam between all the mobs, to keep the judgements refreshed; use Seal of Crusader for an even faster swing.
---
If you want to tank. This is the build I use: [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVVzZVGtI0zgoV0L](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVVzZVGtI0zgoV0L) 
---
PVP as holy? Can DO!  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxuzgRtVMZV0xzb](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxuzgRtVMZV0xzb) is a great 'hilarious build'.
---
Paladin isn't one of those classes you can dribble talent points around and still be effective.
---
* Like, why would you be a better tank than say a  warrior or druid? Warrior gets an ability to have 100% chance to block the next attack; you gotta get critically hit, and even then it'll only be +30% chance. Druid has an enormous HP and Armor count.
---
* Why would you be a better healer than a priest or druid (I'll leave out Shaman since it's faction-specific). A priest has HoTs and a Shield; all instant. Druids have a boat-load of HoTs, and for the same points spent, 50% chance to critically heal with one of their HoTs (Regrowth).
---
....what do you, as a paladin, have? - I view classes with a cynical PoV. Then, I try to mold the class (and spec) to counter that view (see \[way\] below).
---
Toughness isn't really that good at the higher levels because you're going to be near the 'armor softcap', where the percentage of damage mitigation only goes up fractional amounts. This is also why Imp. Devo is relatively pointless; every tank is going to be near the cap so that +25% may only yield \~1-2% more mitigation.
---
Anticipation...defense skills are useless for Warriors and Paladins; Druids sure could use it.  But that's because, unlike us, they don't have many options for +Defense items. - Uncrittable is 440 defense, and you start at 300 (at 60).
---
...I'm also working on getting an uncrushable build that is still crittable; Redoubt serves no purpose if you can't get critted.
---
I had some vacation days to burn or lose before the end of the year, and I took one the day after av came out.  Holy shit was that worth it.  Trying to do AV now for honor that I'm finished with the rep grind is brutal.  Contrary to popular belief, the most frustrating thing isn't going drek vs galv, killing lts or not.  It's that all the tanks who know how to pull warmasters are gone, so everyone keeps body-pulling the entire room and wiping the raid.  Even if the RH is capped, they just drag 4 warmasters back to the spawn point, and every time you res you get cleaved to death before you can go defend the RH flag to the 4-5 horde that recalled.
---
hate to be that guy but i got mine at lv 48 during ony attunement on my first run; to add more salt im a ret paladin. good luck though.
---
Mirah's, has stats, same speed, doesnt but a debuff on the boss. can proc sword spec
---
What kind of dps do you consider as geared?
---
When me and my buddy does it we tend to expand the route to have less downtime, 1st round is arena only and then reset to start the lockout timer. All the next runs we expand it by killing the corner camp if it has 2+ fire elementals, then do the window skip and clean all the elementals en route to Incendius. The added Elemental Fire and its less valuable variants easily gives us som extra gold without having to leave to other places. Other times we just log out for 35 minutes and levels alts in between lockouts.
---
This is exactly what the Horde went through on day 2/3 of last week. Then the queues kept going up and up and it became less fruitful to lose 6-9 minute games when you were sitting in queue for 8-15 minutes afterwards.
---
I'm on high pop and I will take getting ganked a few times over searching forever for a dungeon group.
---
im alliance, im just looking for easy honor like the horde get
---
What is turtle?
---
my old guildmate did over 500 runs
---
The bigger point is that they're doing it wrong, but sure okay, w/e scrub.
---
What you link your own character? 
---
Go through the top 10 speed parses every mt is fury prot.
---
And you don't need a top 5 guild. You need warriors who know how to play the game and who use consumables. The guild as a whole can suck. It takes one player to parse well and ruin your day as a prot Warrior.
---
&gt; if TBC Classic
---
Yea, if. Except a long time ago it was cited the devs might do Classic+, which would have to be a different timeline, as the story would have to be different. The devs even admitted a long time ago that TBC story was a mistake because they ruined Kael, on account of not knowing how else to make big characters aside from raid bosses. 
---
So no, Classic+ would not necessarily be the same timeline.
---
There are some good guides out there for warsong gulch, check YouTube. You can cancel rez because someone may ressurect you at your corpse. No there isn't an imbalance between alliance and horde, you most likely just hurt your chances and also a little unlucky. Pre-made teams of 10 are also a little more common on alliance because they have instant queues so it because an effective way to farm honor for coordinated teams
---
Nobody at rank 5 is getting to rank 8 this week regardless of how much they spammed, let alone rank 9.
---
&gt;This is vanilla.
---
No, it's classic. Big difference.
---
Oeb is garbage for PvP on a warrior. Sure sword spec is s thing, but 0 stamina, 0 crit, huge amount of strength and expertise that's useless in PvP. 
---
TuF is far better than OEB, stamina, crit, and a higher top end than OEB. 
---
Also ES is better than TuF. 
---
The only thing better are rag weapons.
---
Updated models....can't relate
---
"Coordinated team"
---
...herding cats is easier than coordinating a pugged AV. :P
---
What usually happens is:
---
We go Galv, Horde go Bel; send a couple to "critique our efforts on Galv". Horde smoke her. Horde then cap the nearby SHGY.
---
...meanwhile, Horde rogues are now up on SPGY.
---
....Horde then send some back via Recall to base to defend it.
---
....we lose.
---
.......50 minutes (or longer) later.
---
You can literally queue up at the AM portal and head over to their Portal for wpvp or go up to Chillwind, and hit both PL's for more pvp.
---
I’d go mining/engineering just cos it’s most fun.
---
So basically you want back weird bugs that gave you an advantage/chance to exploit certain things. Yeah I'm not unhappy at all they decided to leave such things out.
---
So about 3 months ago we started a second raid.  First week was half guild and half pug.  Clear rag in about 4 hours I think.  We gained many of those pugs.  Second week about 35 guild members 5 pugs.  Still about 4 hours total.  3rd week all guild members and main raid sent MT down to help guild's new MT learn everything, raid took about 2.5 hours.  Ever since the second raid has kept improving.  This last week main raid finished MC and ony in about 1 hour total time and second raid took about 90 minutes.  If main raid is short people they don't recruit from the second raid they recruit from outside guild.  
---
The biggest key I have seen over time is that these two guild runs are treated as equals not as feeders.  The mistake other guilds I have seen do is they treat all the other raids in their guild as feeder raids and this is a mistake cause you suck quality out of that run which demoralizes the people there.
---
Ready to work. Something need doing? Whaaat? Me busy. Leave me alone!! Me not that kind of orc! Why not?! What you want? Hmmm? OK! I can do that. Be happy to. Work, work. Okie dokie. Work complete.
---
Ready to work.
---
At the top brackets this is true. 14 and 13. Everything else below that, no this is probably the most difficult week you are going to have.
---
I bet horde has exact the same shit going on
---
DO NOT KILL THE FISHERMAN! Its a rule, jeez have some manners.
---
I really want the hunter r13 set because its so fucking good untill naxx. but man i dont have the time
---
get gud
---
You dont actually loot insignias, you get some silver and it doesnt allow that person to res at their corpse. 
---
You dont want to cancel the rez. You could run to your corpse but there is no point. 
---
Taunt and aggro abilities do nothing in pvp.
---
Not gonna lie, imo it'd be dumb to quit wow over one piece of gear that has an insanely low droprate.. just stop farming it and grab the next best thing. Let go of the pain
---
Took me 1
---
&gt; or would people just go ‘oh hey that’s someone with way too much free time who can do the most trivial task 15 hours a day every day?’     
---
Isn't that the whole game?
---
I almost can't believe that. There are almost 200 players in brackets 10-14 on Venoxis. You're telling me there are around 200 players with more than 900k honor this week on Lucifron Horde?
---
Tldr: OP is a scrub
---
is that the only way? if I break combat and re-stealth, there's no way to get it off me?
---
very accurate
---
I've gotten far more honor/hr going straight for Drek than this new 'meta' to go after non-Dreks and lose.
---
Sure, if you can win, it's like ~3k honor. But if you lose it's something like ~2k. Which wouldn't be bad if the game hadn't lasted for damn near an hour.
---
Meanwhile, going straight for Drek and killing him in ~10minutes nets around 1k honor.
---
Already managed to get AV exalted on 2 characters. I'm thinking not that many people left farming rep compared those those farming honor.
---
Grabbing 1-3 ghost mushroom spawns to fill remaining lockout time nets a solid 40-60g/h.
---
Here's a good video on it:  
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeexWU\_pPJg&amp;t=3s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeexWU_pPJg&amp;t=3s) 
---
I like to levitate down and PI the first two packs though.
---
And when raid 2 cant do progression, then what happens?   The good players decide they're sick of carrying dead wood, and jump ship.
---
I got exalted on day 1.. but to try and suggest that "most people have exalted" at this point would be false.
---
&gt; you need to essentially grind premade BGs for something like 18-20 hours a day for around 2.5 months of consistently being at the top bracket of honor for the week 
---
This is false.
---
First of, you do not need to no life for this long a period, you can start of slow and get most of the way, and then go hard for maybe 1½-2months
---
And second, the amount of "grind" you have to do, solely depends on how much grind people can do. It's a competition between your own faction, whoever plays the most wins(more or less). So there's no set time requirements. The community decides how hard rank14 is.
---
Next up. Yes it's a time investment thing. Like most things in vanilla and MMO's, skill does not solely grant you rewards, the grind is what makes this a MMO.
---
Also, you do NOT need r14. It's there for the taking if you desperately want it. Why should blizzard let more players get it? So what if only a few guys get it, YOU DO NOT NEED TO GET RANK R14.
---
This version actually is one which DID increase the number of people who can reach the top brackets.
---
I have been incredibly against bringing back this honor system the whole time and yet here we are.  I think people dramatically underestimated what the process actually entailed.  They either had no idea how it worked, or simply didn't understand it.  Maybe they figured since MC was so easy, pvp would be just as easy.  Well PvE you fight bosses.  PvP you fight time itself.
---
I constantly see people asking for advice on where they will reach this week or how much honor they need for the next rank and all that does is tell me these people have no idea how the system works.
---
I know people who did the r14 grind in vanilla, and by and large all of them hated it.  The last several weeks especially were 15-18 hour days and this was on a smaller server with groups that controlled PvP rankings.  Some of them still pvped, in fact I know two who did it again either on the same character or different ones.  THe VAST majority though either quit the game or quit pvping as anything but a side event.
---
It isn't a good system and it isn't a fun system.  It doesn't reward skill, it rewards raw playtime.  For all the South Park jokes, the honor system is where they should be focused.
---
Ah i was actually waiting for these posts.  
---
with the higher realm caps, more people can be R14 at the same time, that is a fact, since its %based.  
---
My opinion is:  
---
Let it be no changes for the first couple of months.  
---
After that the initial zerg race to 14 is over, and you might be able to get a high nice rank. (not 14 tho)  
---
They should only change it, when the ultimate min/max mentality is disallowing a lot of players to even rank up
---
OP, you're the kind of person who makes the world worse.
---
Horde is having this argument with defending/pushing. Were killing the belinda+lieutenants by default.
---
And i thought my 1h20 and 1h30 AV yesterday was too long
---
I am in the opposite ditch, I think it's super important to keep R14 as something that is simply unattainable by the vast majority of players.
---
I like that the game is not fair, and I like games that has a similar mentality (Anarchy Online, Eve Online etc) because it adds to the realism of it, and because it makes certain things become a 'big deal' - content on demand, pay to win, enforced equality is not good game play frameworks, but keeping equity in mind is. 
---
If you wanted to, you could get R14, but you choose not to because the costs are crazy high and you might not feel the rewards are worth that level of effort. But just because you don't want it, doesn't mean that the bar needs to be lowered. Players have a choice, and most will choose not to pursue this,and that's okay.
---
OEB is clearly better in all situations on Horde. The weapon skill is giving the full value no matter what race, and sword spec is much better in PvP. 
---
On alliance if you're in a guild that's maybe less serious and allowing the odd warrior to play the 2H slam spec for a while, TUF is very comparable to OEB and possibly slightly better for human warriors in PvE. OEB all day for PvP though.
---
I am surprised this post was allowed. I tried posting something similar and it got removed. But thanks for posting this.
---
It is the only chest piece, actually. It's by far better than everything else until ZG/AQ40, so taking it from a warrior is like being denied your leaf.
---
Well they could just learn how to do the submerge phase. My group is exclusively doing 18-20 man molten core runs now and it’s a thrill having to actually work against the mechanics
---
The worst part about humanity is the human.
---
easy honor ?

Yeah you are part of the problem, doesn't matter which faction you are.
---
You're never guaranteed anything.
---
Mine usually is:
---
/ra THIS IS PREMADE FROM SULFURON/FIREMAW/SOMERANDOM FOLLOW US FOR UNDER 6 MIN WIN
---
/ra GALV -&gt; LTS -&gt; DREK
---
And then we lose.
---
If people come to the sub Reddit for memes alone, their contribution is anything other than positive.
---
Mark of Resolution doesn't show up for me either
---
GT710 2GB is not enough to game on.
---
I would reach out in the community near you to see if someone has old parts they are not using, and then build a computer for those.
---
Maybe your local reddit group can help out too.
---
Except the game will still last an hour because going straight for Drek doesn't work reliably anymore.
---
The push gets stuffed and you lose.
---
Well, so far, the 'don't rush drek' has accounted for 99.99% of the loses across roughly 40 AVs. - I lost 2 'rush drek' match because Alliance got impatient and tried to down the 'adds' with insufficient healers...and no RHGY. The other ~3 were because the Horde sent a few mages back to aoe bomb us while we were fighting the warmasters and doggos (might not have been the wisest to fight them on the spot where you recall to; lol).
---
I think he's using it as "one will get banned if one keeps doing it".
---
How do you recall back?
---
I had a similar problem, I did 2 things:
---
1. I had a manually set DNS route, I changed it to auto 
---
2. I deactivated IPV6 in my router and ingame
---
Since then I never DCd again
---
Horde on Thalnos, our 2nd team is kicking ass. It took a few weeks to work out some kinks and get a consistent roster showing up. Now we’re working on clear times.
---
It's why we shouldn't listen or care about minorities; they're always bitching about something.
---
Blizzard does almost all of their shit on Tuesdays across all games.  It used to be much worse.  It used to be a solid 6+ hours every week, and that was if we were lucky and things went smoothly or didn't get emergency maintenance some other time.
---
Server stability in general is massively better even with the DDoS attack early on.  It was common to get comped an extra couple of days almost every month because of how much downtime they had.
---
it does exist.  
---
I even think every swing timer addon, shows you the boss swing timer as well
---
I use scroll wheel up &amp; down for battle/berserker and mouse button 3 for defensive. Back in vanilla I used the f keys but it's not convenient enough to be fluid
---
Most aesthetic for you lol
---
It is the ultimate medal of dedication. Whether or not you personally find dedication in a Videogame something to look up to is completely up to you.
---
&gt;a) this is the first gen. That's the most tryhard one. It will get a lot easier over time to rank
---
People are also underestimating how long this "first gen" will last... on high populated servers there are like 100 or so people who are gunning for that rank 14 and consider themselves "first gen".  There are however, even on the highest populated servers only room for 10-15 people in bracket 14 and they need to stay in that bracket for 4 weeks.... for all of these 100 "first gen" people we are talking 400/15= 27 weeks BEST CASE SCENARIO. This will be a shitshow for half a year and that half year has not started yet.. It starts as soon as we have our first rank 13 in a couple of weeks.
---
When instead of spreading out or dividing into groups the entire group, or raid, will work together in one gigantic defense against the other team. It's called a turtle because you bunker down and don't move very fast due to having to fight the other team for every metre.
---
A win and generally way more rep.  When queues are 12+ minutes, I'd rather be in the game playing than sitting /afk in the cave.
---
Or just walk away from the deal. :P
---
What's wrong with 2 resto druids? I consistently get top 2-3 heals in MC fights, especially if we are allowed to use our innervate.
---
The Lobotomizer is shit for PvE sadly. The debuff alone makes it unusable in raid situations.
---
All out defense. Going into your "shell". When you're in AV and a majority of your team is defending inside their base that is called turtling.
---
I've actually been blocking with flag a lot to block off debuffs if I'm in a bind or even to quickly block a spike of incoming damage. Since I'm the only one who knows exactly when I'm going to block, I'll be the only one ready to spam repick and I get it every time.
---
I think salty ally was p2, now its salty H and gloating A.
---
AV trinket
---
&gt; /ra THIS IS PREMADE FROM 
---
It's never really a premade, but calling it a premade boosts peoples confidence in the leadership.

---
One of the most fun moments, atleast one i got on stream.   
---
It's the small and silly things that makes classic worth playing imo.
---
Stupid americans, am i rite?
---
Is there a Teleport to either continent that I can get as a 38 warlock (enchant/tailoring)? Was Druid and the moon glade teleport with a SW hearth was nice for getting around quick. 
---
Running and waiting for a boat now is a major rhythm killer.
---
Your math is wrong somewhere.  You must remember that the chance to get the item is the same every run and that past results do not affect future chance.
---
The formula you want to be using is 1 - ( ( 1 - x ) \^ y ) where x is drop chance and y is # of runs.  Therefore, if the item has a 7% drop rate and you did the run twice, the probability of getting this would be 13.5%.  In your formula "(1-p) \* (1-p)", the probability of getting the item would be 86.5% which is obviously way too high after only 2 runs.  With a 7% drop rate, it would actually take 28 runs to have an 86.5% probability of getting the item.
---
Anyways, this guy ran it 257 times which means the probability of getting the item is 99.99%, but the thing that is frustrating is that after doing the run so many times, the 258th run still has a 7% chance to drop the item, individually they are unique events.  But theoretically the probability is approaching nearly 100%, so it is extremely unfortunate to have not seen the item drop by now.
---
Seems to be a lot of negativity around this comment. Yes, greens will suffice for leveling. But if this an alt and you dont mind dropping 20g to help it level better with blues from the AH (I wouldnt enchant) then that is the better way. Most blues will last you 10-15 levels. So you rarely will have to upgrade. Plus once you start hitting 45+ you'll be accessing better gear dropping dungeons.
---
Point is 20-30g on weapons is nothing and they do make a larger difference than you think. Ive spent a grand total of 12g on two blue bows for my hunter, and the second one (lvl 35) will last me til AV crossbow.
---
R3 can be achieved in 1 week if you're in the top 3% or so, even starting at zero rp.
---
Assuming you're not starting from 0 it's more attainable in a week.
---
Trying hard is a relative phrase in this case, you're right.
---
not if you find a decent guild lol
---
Good guilds are the best part of wow imo
---
If they're not good enough for the core team, then how are you recruiting players from it?
---
Depends on what your raid wants. If they want to just rush reputation and the zerg is beaten they my prefer to just let the Horde win to end the game as quick as possible. If they want to get honour they'll turtle up.
---
Not really, a warrior wielding it will still out-dps a Ret. Sure he/she won't dps as much as the other warriors using 'more optimal' weapons. But will still do more dps than a Ret with it.
---
Yeah, I just havent maxed my herb yet, doing it atm :)
---
"still an upgrade" :P
---
Dude that’s uncalled for. Grow up. He just wants people to stop wasting their life on achievements in video games.
---
You can login straight away :)
---
The world is round, dumbass.
---
My guild is not like what you’re describing. We started with one team, which has steadily been getting more serious (full world buffs, full consumes minus flask, clearing under 1hr). But we’ve been recruiting for a second, less serious raid team. We did this as an option for people in our original raid team that don’t want to take it so serious can drop back but still have a home with the guys they’ve been with for months.
---
The first team used mains and alts to help fill out the 2nd raid, and ensure it went smooth (we even raid short to make sure the new team was solid). Alts have zero loot priority. The raid went smooth. Cleared in under 1.5 hours and 1 shot every boss while teaching, which a good number of the new guys having never cleared the raid prior to joining. This is better than a lot of other guilds, and will only improve as they mesh more.
---
The original team will be helping the new team until they have enough people to run on their own, which then we’ll pull the alts and stuff out to begin splits for the first team. There is no “this is the good team, the other is the bad team” mentality.  We have plenty of older members willing to help the newer ones have a good time and clear content. We just have higher baseline expectations of one, which we are transparent about.
---
How many people in your raids?
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#bxzGsViZbZVMGpczo
---
Hey I was wondering about things. When I'm healing pvp like WSG I mostly use flash heal which isnt affected by the reduced cast time from divine fury anyway. And with mana being an issue how do you feel about this talent build?
---
If this is Zizek from Dragonmaw, you are one of the few people I remember from Vanilla simply because how feared you were by all of the Alliance, myself included!
---
I have that exact PC lol. I can play 30 fps @ 900p however it drops and gets very laggy in raids or if there are a lot of spells going on, and this is on low settings.. I recommend if you do buy this to invest £50-£70 in a better GPU
---
Woah woah woah, clearly better in terms of racials? Have you seen the dwarf and human racial called "able to play paladin". Ask the turbo neckbeard guilds like APES and GRIZZLY. Alliance is a better faction in vanilla, once you apply horde pvp racials to paladins, thats when the game is terrible imba. But 10 seconds of immunity on your healer with no counter play and insanely good scaling buffs makes alliance better at organized pvp and better at end game pve. They just look stupid af so no one wants to play them.
---
I did 15 runs and we got 3 hoj and 1 savage gladiator chain lol
---
how hard is to get rank 3 now? wanna get it for alts to have cheaper mount
---
Whats the strategy for a Paladin? I mean I try and kite and keep away and counterspell on heal, but that bubble is a pain. Any tips?
---
upper hand should be faster than the bottom hand for this rotation, you should try it
---
I'd just use google for that, simple 'Druid wow classic' followed by relevant topic points like macros, pvp, raiding, that sort of thing. Icyveins and WoWhead have great write ups on the topic as well if you are interested in guides.
---
There have been some adapting, a little bit. Going left past the field of strife instead of going right at the bunker. Makes it harder to slow them down at the center with mages when they do that.
---
35 people in each group lately.
---
So let me get this straight, if you get deserter your character is locked in place for 15 minutes and you can't do anything?
---
It seems a lot of people have killed this boss at least &lt;overestimated large number&gt; of times. I didn't get my loot until 1234 kills.
---
We knew at the announcement that there would be people that did have rose tinted glasses, and that would definitely quit within a couple months of playing it, forgetting how hard it was, or forgetting the time requirements. We KNEW there would be a group of people they wouldn't enjoy Classic, but that doesn't mean *nobody* likes Classic. Lots of people thought they did, but didn't, but there are even more than thought they did and actually did, like me. That's why I'm glad Blizzard stated they would support the game no matter the population level, because that means the game is left for those of us that wanted the actual game, flaws and all (even the ones Blizzard introduces when we don't want them to).
---
I love the little clap the lady in the back gives at the end there.
---
Then I'm getting extremely lucky.
---
Some people*
---
FTFY
---
Haha I have the day off and was planning to play but then I saw the maintenance message. My guild told me I was stupid and it was just a 1 hour maintenance. Guess they’re stupid.
---
I agree. Most of the time the games are generally more or less the same.
---
Rush Belinda, gather whatever commanders and lts you can get, kill em, some run north to get towers and vandaar and a bunch hearth back to defend.
---
This seems to be the new meta for most horde games I play. 
---
Much better this way in my opinion than the mass zerg rush fest that was happening day 1. I get it that it's better rep per hour, but like... this is a game and I'd rather have fun. If it takes me an extra day to get exalted, who cares? I'm still going to get exalted.
---
MH dropped our first guild run together and a fucking hunter won it. Me and the rogues lost our shit. The hunter wasn’t a troll just didn’t know his rare it was sadly. We ran it with master loot after that.
---
Wow, what a compelling argument you make there!
---
Nah, you just have shit taste :3
---
Yeah spending my limited free time waiting in a 15 minute queue is sooooo great. What a stupid post.

Yes! I normaly use 10-15 Juju's per week, so i gotta keep it stored.
---
Big oof if true.
---
Basically down 1 day a week.. cold you be more dramatic.
---
Im sure this was a weekly post on wow forums back in the range from 04-09
---
Seriously! Was hoping to stay awake to get a quest done once reset was done, but no, we have to wait for 8 hours?
---
lol I haven't even started focusing on my honor rank because I'm still trying to reach 60
---
The mentality of "If you have a full-time job you're a casual and just shouldn't even bother" is real and super annoying. When Phase 2 was announced and everyone here was discussing how bad it would be and whether it would even be possible to level at a reasonable pace, I said if the worst of those predictions turned out to be correct that would be a huge disappointment because I was only level 45. Then someone told me if I wasn't already level 60 I was never going to get there anyway and I should have known that going in.
---
The thing that's really interesting about it is that the vast majority of people I encounter in-game are pretty cool and more than happy to help and give advice, and even listen to me complain when I get too frustrated with how difficult it is to get anything done. The worst example I've ever encountered in-game was last night when I posted in trade chat saying "52 Hunter LFG I don't care which dungeon I just want xp without getting ganked constantly" and someone told me to go to a PVE server, which is still pretty mild. But online it's very different. Maybe I'll get roasted more in-game once I level up more and start going to BGs. Sure hope not though, I really like this game and haven't had much interest in other games since it came out. I love playing it the vast majority of the time but sometimes it can get really frustrating, and some of the player base acts like it's a huge affront to the dignity of the game to show that frustration.
---
Not deep enough to be submerged. Unless maybe you're a gnome.
---
I wish this graph was accurate. I play on grobb and I am regretting it a lot. Horde is completely unhelpful and spends majority of the day in org. Ally just runs around in deathball and ganks all day. I would reroll but I spent a lot of time on my character. I can’t wait until they open up server xfer again so I can get off this damn server.
---
How important is fire resist for rag as a mage? We're trying rag this weekend after going 8/10 last weekend. So far I've gotten by completely fine with nothing but mage armor and fire ward, even when we were short on healers that night.
---
Alliance is hopeless, now. If I'm feeling up for honor I'll farm it, otherwise I'll just afk like the other 10 people.
---
Don't fret I have done 165 UBRS runs, still no MH drop.

With item rack installed, alt clicking adds that slot to a trinket menu style bar. You can do this for any slot, not just trinkets.

It’s only the second time since release not really a big deal...maybe try going outside

god damn, i havent had a game over 45 minutes, even all the so called "turtles" that they bitch about in chat end in about 30
---
&gt;basically down 1 day every 1.5 months
---
Ahh yes, 8, which is "basically" 24
---
Longest AV I've had (4k from exalted now) was about 45min, so hours long AV are pretty rare. That said, the Horde now has 10-15 minutes queue, considering this, it's not efficient to let Alliance win the zerg race as it was at the beginning with instant queue.
---
Now we split the ally zerg at Balinda, kill the slower one and let about 20 or so get to galv. We then kill Balinda and all the CM/LTs, at that point 10-15 of us recall to Drek and wipe what remains of the staggered zerg, then we kill Vann. Takes about 20 to 30 min, but you get a ton more Rep doing it this way. Especially once you're Revered.
---
1/3 of one day =\= basically 1 day.

Literally the only way to express your displeasure is to unsub.

It's the second week in a row of extended maintenace. November 26 maintenace was 6+ hours as well, I believe

Keep going for it! It will drop.

as far as I can tell it's just the knockback. that's exactly what it looks like and as far as sprinting, I dont see the warriors feet moving at all
---
I meant a discord or something, my server isn't going to be organizing a premade, but server shouldn't matter as long as you're on the same region.
---
I’d say its the other way around.  If the looting rules havent been made clear and something that is valuable to everyone is needed on then its not their fault.
---
No one should have to ask for permission to roll on something that hasnt been explicitly stated as reserved.
---
Must not have been a good premade, wsg is the best honor of efficient
---
People that talk like this are usually mediocre at the game.  It's sad really.  They have to give off this elitist aura, because deep down, they know they're shit.
---
It’s really insane how different the queues are for alliance and horde.
---
I got exalted as horde yesterday, and I even missed out on Friday. So Saturday, Sunday and Monday grinding. The queues got as slow as 20 mins yeah, I wonder how quickly I could have farmed the rep if I was alliance.
---
It's because Blizzard has a skeleton crew for Classic, and the only smart people are on vacation this week. We're left with the unpaid interns who have no idea what they're doing.

Cool to see you scribble down this! Would be interesting if you added an average win game lenght, and an average loss game lenght!

Bunker Captain
---
repeating, of course.

F
---
Cool, that's what I was planning to do. I have a friend who """played vanilla""" who insists that everyone needs 150+ at all times.
---
I mean do we want more exploits in BGs? Do we want our honor to not roll over like it did for 2 weeks? Do we want random bugs to become prevalent? Are these things the community rather complain about than 8 hr downtimes?
---
Almost all prenerf gruul kills were with 7 or more mages.
---
the alliance side is deep, like 20 gnomes depth
---
This is completely wrong, at least on OCE I can tell you that. All the rushers are from Arugal.
---
Does anyone know what they are actually doing tho?
---
Man they're ruining one of your *five* days of free time per week? Rough life dude I feel for you...
---
Tuesday maintenance has been a thing for decades, in more than just WoW. They have to do it some time.
---
FFS i really wish people would stop soutiung this BS
---
the proc from lobo just like the proc from GGR is a low prio debuff, it will not knock off anything important. additionally all bosses in MC die so damn fast is a complete non issue
---
What about all the times MC didn't work
---
It doesnt count it. The only way to have the accurate number is counting yourself afaik, might be an addon I don't know though
---
Keep going!
---
People would have to be too naive (?) to think horde wouldnt have longer queue times for av atleast (dont know about wsg queue times because for now only av rep exists for me). Tho in the first few days i had at most 3 to 4 minuts queue but as more ally gets exalted the more longer it takes.
---
I had guild mates with time on their hands that got exalted quite fast as horde when av released. im not so lucky because i can only play like for 3 to 4 hours at night and even so i got more interests than to spent my free week nights only playing wow but already 5k into revered so im guessing probably this next weekend ill get exalted
---
Thanks! You bet!

Don't sweat the lost gold, you'll be able to print gold in Dire Maul when you hit 60

Second time since last week.

Absolutely this. The people who are yelling to "Rush Drek" are offering up bad advise, as it no longer works. Those same people are also the ones who flame the group and complain the whole time, blaming everyone but themselves.
---
It's a self-defeating cycle. Demand that we use old tactics that don't work. Those old tactics don't work. Insult the group. Quit. Wait 15 minutes. Try again. Repeat.
---
Those people will never admit that they are the problem, but unless they look to adapt to new tactics, they are doomed to just be angry all the time since their chosen tactic no longer works.
---
I don't know what to tell you. The rushers on OCE are all from the PvP server.
---
350 DPS.
---
Yikes.
---
Nice! I ended up going ally on Benediction!
---
I second this. 
---
Even building/buying a budget desktop means you have to get all the peripherals (monitor/keyboard/mouse) or even it it comes with these, it's at the cost of performance &amp; you get less bang for your buck. 
---
Get a used laptop + a decent mouse and you're g2g.
---
No, it's a quest you get outside the AV entrance - you have to go into a cave to retrieve a flag (for alliance, might be different for horde)
---
Do you have a source on this? Never head of only losing 2500 under threshold before!
---
My guess is that it will vary dramatically by server. Check out the honor tab for some of the smaller RP or PvE servers - it's not unusual to find someone with 40k honor last week and standing 9. Sure, the honor pool will be smaller on those servers, but there are still raiders doing BGs for rep, and R10 will be a whole different ballgame than on a larger PvP server.
---
The original ~6 PvP servers are going to be insane to rank on because the hardcore players are concentrated there, too.

I don't know how they do it, especially since horde has queue times in EU, but somehow they manage to queue up with 40 people. Maybe they wrote an Addon in order to coordinate that so well, that it works?
---
Where is the best place to AoE farm at 31? Looking for somewhere that I can get some decent XP and maybe some decent drops to vendor for gold toward my 40 mount or disenchant for mats.
---
&gt;Very few (if any) guilds will be okay with you raiding as PVE in later phases, especially if you're a new recruit.
---
I think you mean PvP
---
I rolled shadow weaver for our guild, but instead decided to do disc (31) / shadow (20). That means I am still healing and keeping shadow weaving up, and I can power infuse our highest magic dps. It's a fun spec and you still get to heal and get all your gear  :)
---
That's cool.
---
Lol so spoiled.  This was every Tuesday for many many years in WoW.
---
ahh shoot, I’m in Alaskan time so I always mess it up
---
Lol, losing sucks. Not that you're wrong, if Alliance keep losing they will keep quitting and horde queues will go up.
---
You can be both. Shoot for the stars!
---
Yea ofc :)
---
Are you shure it's not nawtzhi
---
Can be an issues with your systemtime. Check if your system time is accurate after shutting the computer down completely.
---
ew, not me.
---
Mages are pretty awful in group play in general. Couple MC runs ago we had \*eight\* of them, and I had to request arcane int multiple times before my group got it. That's just the worst example, it happens all the time. Getting water isn't usually as bad, one or two of them will give it out usually (this happens in 5 mans too often). Though you still often have to ask multiple times in a raid before someone decides to make some. I should probably not buff them until they learn the basics of cooperating in a raid/group.
---
Zandalar? :P
---
I hope so. I'm completely fine with this if they are actually doing quality maintenance and fix whatever the community has issues with...but I know from experience of Blizzard maintenance over the last decade or more, thats not the case. 8 hours of maintenance will bring almost nothing noticeable. Oh but everyones honor will update! Yay!
---
I understand running a guild CAN be time consuming if you're trying to run guild events, or experience a ton of turnover and constantly need to recruit. Honestly for us there is no communication, scheduling, and very little recruiting. Everyone shows up for raid, we clear, see ya next week. GM could be passed to a random raider and you wouldn't notice a difference. GM and officers (who got officer by being boys with GM and do nothing) are basically there to do loot council and that's it. It is what it is.
---
I've just been keeping a mental note, often run in sets of 5 so it's fairly easy to
---
in the current phase of the game TPS from deep prot/impale prot with 3 set might and drillborer is quite comparable to fury prot that will shift in BWL however.
---
bit of a difference between "oh bummer I was looking forward to playing" and letting this ruin your day dude.
---
Huh?  It's 7am - 2pm PST, 8am - 3pm CST, 10am - 5pm EST.  It rarely lasts the full 8 hours.
---
Oh it sucks, I was looking for to seeing my updated rank and having a rainy game sess today. Oh well, trying not to act like an addict ha
---
Or they want the pants and bracers, which are BIS for some.
---
2H Fury is very viable on Horde. Slam with the /stopattack macro makes sure that you still get your auto attacks through *and* get to slam while welcoming people to the jam!
---
For PVE, OEB is straight up better. Hell, on Horde it's as good as Ashkandi because you can't get 2H Sword weapon skill anywhere else. For Alliance, both are good.
---
ali
---
Drink a juice box and take a nap. It works for cranky toddlers.
---
Do you keep your raid frames like that during combat?
---
I'm not saying its good or bad though..? It's definitely not good by any means. But also it's a HUGE stretch to say its closer to 30/70, instead of saying its 35/65 or anything else. Considering one of the sites that checks warcraft logs says 35.2/64.8 (closer to 60/40), or https://wowclassicpopulation.com/ being 42/58 (though that seems pretty off) however its 37/63 at lv60. So it's closer to 35/65, and between that and 40/60.
---
&gt; it was the first crack in Arthas' soul
---
Stratholme is a horcrux...
---
CONFIRMED! Arthas coming back in Shadowlands!
---
I haven't seen anything in regards to that.
---
Unless Blizz is literally scanning your running tasks for TeamViewer, it would have no effect on the gamefiles.
---
+people flaming each other all the time. Its almost on  a league of legends level minus the racial slurs
---
They should just change the game so that everyone is a winner
---
Same, I've been having a great time so far. Made friends, got into a guild. Steadily progressed and became the raid MT healer. Classic has been everything I had hoped.
---
Slam spec also works on horde; It can trigger Windfury and with the macro deals very respectable damage.
---
I lvled a warr also and yeah stick to your plan.  No need to spec into prot to tank, only thing I had issues with while tanking is rage and it was because my tank set was too heavy on mitigation so my advice is use a combination of tank gear plus some dps pieces to keep the rage flowing so you can hold threat.
---
Won't get them anywhere close to r14. You may expect 600k honor from botting 24/7 AV, alot are easily double that
---
It's so weird seeing this video have this many upvotes, when literally 2 or 3 days ago someone posted about doing this very same thing and was flamed to all hell.
---
But now, since there is a video of it, rather than just someone explaining it, everyone is loving this?
---
Reddit is a messed up place man.
---
That's what I'm currently doing, gotta get that BIS though ;D
---
vanish
---
You also lash out like a child.
---
I think weekends came with AB, which I think is scheduled for phase 4, but they'll almost certainly release it early.
---
Amusing but in the end, that is toxic. It intentionally ruins the game for another.
---
Respec to a holy nova build
---
I played 5 hours straight last night and didn’t have a single game where 25+ horde didn’t turtle and not a single game under 25 minutes. No wins. It feels like a real shit show.
---
It's unacceptable is what it is, a multi billion dollar company pushing an update for a 16+ year old game takes longer than the pre-patch update for Legion and BFA COMBINED.
---
What bugs?
---
What bugs did they miss in last weeks EIGHT hours of downtime?
---
This is a 16+ year old game.
---
Want to know why it takes so long, probably because they have ONE part timer working on it.
---
I pay for a months worth of game time, not a month - a day.
---
What in the hell could cause 8 hours of downtime in a freaking 16 year old game.
---
I am legitimately unsubscribing because of this.
---
Tuesday is my one fucking day off a week and I get to not play the game for 8+ hours.
---
Yesterday it said 8-9. I can 'understand' last weeks 8 hours because of battle grounds, and that is a VERY loose 'understand' but what in the hell are they doing THIS WEEK that needs EIGHT HOURS?
---
The exalted AV mount.
---
Gorosh is a myth
---
#somechanges
---
Bring a druid, and fight under the ledge near the back of the stairs - the adds wont aggro you.
---
It might be doable solo, but is 110% doable duo.
---
This is how it use to be. Im sure the stuff they need to check doesnt change much.
---
Accurate.
---
Prot is far superior for both dungeon tanking and if your raid is doing progression raiding.
---
WeaponSwingTimer
---
Finally out of school, two Tuesday mornings in a row off, excited to get some long overdue gaming in. Sigh.
---
Yeah dunno what that asshat is on about. As if working all week only for the game to hit maintenance for 8 hours on your only day off isn't enough to put someone in a bad mood. You obviously must be ADDICTED to video games lmao
---
Thanks for the unhelpful and dickish response. Its a genuine question out of curiosity, not a complaint.
---
Probably not, since you wouldn’t be able to have a raid team.
---
Not at PC atm but there is one which shows you the swing timer for your target. Had swing timer in its name I believe.
---
The people who hit rank 14 are people with no jobs/life other then wow or streamers begging for rent money so they can contin3 to play 16 hours a day. Don't forget Twitch Prime though.
---
It was crazy easy to hit r4-5 before bgs. 
---
My rank will drop a lot I imagine. I’ve only done like 75k honor this week.
---
In Finland we receive money from the government by earning enough credits in university/ university of applied sciences and its not a loan. That money is enough to cover expenses in most cases. We also get student loan which is not mandatory to take and only 60% of it needs to be paid back if we graduate on time.
---
That's insane, j just have vendored at least 45 sashes from 2 man arena runs
---
It says right on the breaking news: 7am-3pm pst. You cut an hour off. Also I know it won't be 8 hours, but the guy above me thinks it's 3am for everyone. He must live on an island.
---
Perfect time for your weekly dig out from pizza roll plates and Dew cans to slay the Shower boss and collect his half-ass hygiene buff!
---
Fury/prot dual wield tanking provides garbage threat in dungeons unless you're on a pure single target fight.
---
I've only seen gorosh about 40 times out of all these arena runs
---
12.5% drop on eye vs 5% on bre or spinal.
---
Lol wanting to play during a HUGE chunk of the roughly 20 hours I get to play during an entire week equates to an addiction? 
---
You seem like you're very well-versed in mental health/addiction studies. Why are you even on a gaming sub?yYu should be out helping the world with all that knowledge.
---
This is what loot council does. Creates drama.
---
Yall are hilarious, please post more videos of yall leveling
---
Yup.. in raid boss fights your stam is valuable for survivability and with several lifetaps/ rune uses, stam = int
---
Daze
---
Its a function of your Defense skill, the level of the enemy attacking you, and being hit in the back.
---
I dont know the exact maths, but tanks will eventually become daze immune which is useful for mounted dungeons like AQ/ZG
---
You can find pugs early in the morning, but during the day it will all be premades.
---
Can confirm that it will alter anyone’s motivation to continue playing the game.  Back in vanilla, I hit R14 and then raided after but didn’t last long.  I quit and it was because I was just so burned out from playing.
---
Yeah fuck me for being cranky about 8 hours of downtime the one day a week I get off. You deserve a round of applause for your pious ability to refrain from the world of Warcraft, we’re all very proud of you.
---
Had one drop from a Lbrs gem run
---
This is my biggest thing. There's no reason for it, and I'm sorry, 7 AM to 3 PM is not the slowest time in game, especially when you consider time zones. That 3 PM to my east coast server is 6 PM, which is prime time.
---
It's also a shock to new players that don't know about this "tradition". As a long time gamer, I can't think of any game that experiences this much downtime on a consistent basis. My guild has 10-15 parents that can only play during the day and are newer to WoW. Many are considering quitting because 15 dollars a month to the budget just isn't worth restricted game time.
---
It hasn't been that way for a long ass time has it though? Kind of dumb to say you aren't allowed to be upset about something because it was that way like 10 years ago imo
---
Karma!
---
Yeah, I was on sick leave so I had some time to spend.... I don't think it was that much, but I surely spent 9-10 hours in AV over the day and since alliance lost 95% of the matches, I am still far away from exalted.
---
In the industry with planned maintenances you don't take down customer facing services in the middle of the day.  These should be scheduled in the middle of the night in a maintenance window.
---
This guy thinks 9 women can have a baby in 1 month.
---
I dont disagree at all. I just see that a lot of people say it shouldnt go to a warrior and I think its still a great weapon. Ofc its not perfect and lacks in pve but not everyone is min/maxing the whole content :)
---
Haha, I think you’re fine. I think this guy needs to learn a little more when/how to use vanish.
---
In early 40s levels, just as portals are available, those runes are disproportionately expensive relative to the gold you're making.  By 52+ they should be pennies compared to the loot.  Super short-sighted to be stingy with them at that point.
---
6 to 8 is a pretty huge jump my dude. You'd need like bracket 13 to move from middle of 6 to bottom of 8.
---
Honestly two weeks in a row and Blizzards statement about the week 1 and 2 honor investigation make me very suspicious that there are still honor bugs.
---
Considering how sensitive the WoW community is about Blizzard getting RP correct I'd advocate a little patience
---
If the pet is set to attack you before you stealth, then you cant get it off you unless you use Vanish. Remember Stealth isnt invisible, it allows you to sneak around.....but vanish allows you to disappear from sight, entering an improved stealth mode for 10 sec. Thats why you lose all pet aggro when you use vanish, but not stealth.
---
Please don't go fury prot for 5 mans... It is the literal worst warrior spec for 5 man dungeons. Fury prot excels at one thing, and that's building a ton of threat on a single target. That is not what you need to be doing in 5 mans.
---
Anyone that didnt get the honor equivalent of exhaltes with AV this week is going to get blasted in the standings. Literally hundreds of PvE only players are hovering around the 250-300k honor total (on horde) because thats about what you get from grinding full rep. Being below 250k will put you at standing 500-1000+ depending on server. 
---
Its going to be weird seeing it change from this week to next week.
---
Haha I wouldn't! I'm pve spec anyways!
---
It’s not about working around anyone, it’s about blizzard having 8h of game downtime without announcing reasons behind it.
---
Because retail is run and managed by the A-team, and they have smoothed out and optimized the maintenance process.
---
Classic is run by B-team and interns, and they have no clue what they are doing.
---
It ends up being not worth it even on longer fights.  I'd suggest sticking to your standard MP5 gear instead of losing out on a large amount of SP.  A few things I'd suggest you can do instead:
---
Firstly, you should be using major manas and demo runes on cd if you aren't already.  If your seeing longer clear times you want to spec into Mental Agility 5/5  instead of 4/5 imp Mindblast.  This will make your rotation more Mindflay heavy and less MBs which will improve your mana efficiency overall (Your rotation should go MB -&gt; MF -&gt; MF MB to MB -&gt; MF -&gt; MF -&gt; MF 2 ticks -&gt; MB).  It's also standard to down rank your spells for longer fights - mostly Mb.  There are also some better options out there if you're mana starved (R10 gear - I'll be using head/shoulders until I replace with Mantle and Hexxers Cover 12 mp5 vs 5 sp). Hope this helped.
---
I just bought a second account to dual box hunters, I actually unsubbed because of today's downtime.
---
It's unacceptable, 8 hours maintenance with no notice or reason (I am sure as shit all the bugs that the previous maintenance introduced will still be a thing after this one) I honestly don't care anymore.
---
My patience with blizzard was at an all time low after the Blitz Chung fiasco, and now with random downtimes that are as long as a work day, I honestly don't care anymore.
---
I honestly think you are right, with the stuff blizzard has done in the past I actually think this is a plausible reason as to the 8 hours of downtime today, and it disgusts me.
---
If they're still green to you, I'd say the Farmers in Hillsbrad Foothills.  Once you hit lvl 33, you can do Silithid is 1000 Needles.
---
https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/aoe-grinding-frost-mage-leveling-talent-build-from-1-to-60
---
Yeah everyone asks "who are the top rankers?" nobody asks "how are the top rankers?"
---
I have to second this, old dell, and a used GPU at a budget this low, anything new off the shelf is going to be really bad. Much better deals on the used market at that price range.
---
Just hit level 47 and helped some people with a dungeon yesterday. We got to a chest and everyone rolled for it and I won but a guy ninjaed it. I was upset because there were a couple expensive recipes in it. 
---
The worst part was everyone’s reaction which was to say nothing. The guy just asked me if I needed anything from the chest and said he was gonna take it if I did it. I’m lucky I’ve not had any bad experiences like this so far but I don’t get how to handle ninjas.
---
Horde on Incendius and in our guild we have 4 raid groups rollin through Ony and MC easily.
---
Best class is a troll hunter.
---
Then a paladin at same place as warriors
---
Then hunters overall
---
Then last place... Shamans
---
That’s why you always find better players to go against or play with a handicap to keep getting better.  People that actually like pvp constantly dueled, ran BGs and world pvp.  Always looking for another challenge and the rank 13s and 14s I cared to know all did that.  That doesn’t include the people that payed to have their toons lvled to 14 but most of them were banned.
---
*But...why poop socks?*
---
Not exactly the same problem but my latency has been skyrocketing from time to time after the latest patch. Some times in AV every raid member is running still on my screen at balinda and i sometimes get to drek (2-3mins) and see no NPCs or raid members and then suddenly i’m being teleported somewhere on the map. And this happend every 3rd game or so. Had same issues during last MC.
---
You didn't have to pixelated it, can't read those names anyway lol
---
Some Blizzard employee: "Our data indicates that BFA player numbers go up by 1.2% during Classic maintenance."
---
Blizzard admin: "Great. Extend all Classic maintenance to 8 hours."
---
Right. He passed on a guaranteed huge upgrade for like a 2% shot at a bigger upgrade...silly choice.
---
Herb(or mining) + skinning when leveling every class. Then at 60 drop and pick what you want.
---
Pretty much this. Server shutdowns was a thing for the first few years of wow. There are things in classic that requires them to shit the servers down this long due to #nochanges
---
If your team is better than other teams, you will get honor faster. Whats not to understand?
---
You will be more beastmaster and spam level 1 clipwing
---
I played against this specific bitch of a priest just last night in wsg. He stood there for basically entire game and nobody had any idea what he was doing there. Feels so weird seeing him here now xD.
---
Zv-Mograine the hunter from last night that stayed defense 24/7
---
Prat
---
Yeah, I feel you. It’s gonna be sad too when you check honor for the week and getting 440k honor for the week will maybe move me from rank 6.5 to rank 7... maybe...
---
So the raid just handles everything by itself, bosses fall down and no one pays attention to raid setup, sign ups, voice comms etc and you clear easily every week? Without drama about loot council from people who show no interest to improve the raid? Because that's what loot council is about - distributing items with priority to players who need or deserve them more than others, either because of dedication or general improvements to raid performance.  
---
Leaves open the question why any group of players that is capable of playing mc without communication and coordination would stay in a guild that provides nothing but takes what it wants for the few who "run it", if that's even applicable.
---
Yeah, except the difference is on those "sometimes" they credited our accounts with +1 day.  If you don't believe me, look at your account billing history and scroll back to 2005-2006.
---
Ok qt
---
thanks
---
Agreed that once the bugs were shaken out, downtime was 3-4hrs 
---
When BGs and honor came out you were lucky to get to raid at a 8pm start time after Q and any updates were done.
---
Spent 4 hours last night in desolace camping the same two troll hunters bots with Chinese pet names, never targeted me, would return to corpse in 4-5min after death and die again, they seemed to be farming the centaurs for silk nearby
---
They didn't implement the setting where you can turn XP off yet? I remember that from vanilla but can't recall what patch they did it in.
---
thanks homie
---
Man I think try 60-70% aren't actually pushing for honor and just looking for AV rep.
---
*Puts class ability in game*
---
*Player uses class ability*
---
*Blizzard bans Player*
---
Yeah....that makes sense.
---
You have 30 days before mail expires though right? Don't even worry about it, just farm gold hard
---
They put such a large window because whatever they are doing is going to take longer than usual. If they put the usual 1 hour time frame and it were to take 1 hour and 1 minute, people would rage and demand to see the manager. 
---
They are most likely patching the bugs with Honor and such, which requires a decent amount of testing in the live environment, including forced Honor rollovers and such.
---
They are fine most of them account share
---
Oh wow, one guild managing to hold chain. That's exactly the Same as camping every FP and gy in the world.
---
Yeah, people are adamant that now is the worst time to honor grind, but for casuals looking to get \~R7 it might be the best. The pool will never be larger than right now with casuals in low brackets.
---
Yep. In fact if you're in a group with one of your other characters, you can drop a portal, go through, then log your other guy and use the portal on them too.
---
Yes I get 1,5k xp at lvl 39 for 3 WSG marks
---
It can be feasible, but would require more staff.
---
At least one of them, namely Tom Chilton, was a designer for both.
---
This
---
OMG! Are the servers up yet?
---
You’re fighting a losing battle m8.
---
In my experience, most R14s are hardcore rankers playing extremely efficient, maybe 8-10 hours a day and only doing AV-premades.
---
With all the turtle-games the difference between unorganized and organized groups is colossal, to the point where solo-queuing and semi-afk'ing even for 16+ hours a day is not enough to reach rank14 on competitive servers.
---
i really preferred this tbh, nice having actual server downtime to catch up on sleep/real life self care shit
---
Not everyone is unemployed with no family.
---
&gt;  I don't like raiding, running dungeons for gear feels like a waste of time, and every time I queue for a bg it's a fucking premade every single time. I don't really know where to go. 
---
To a different game, I suppose.
---
Simply put, if you don't like raiding, then Vanilla WoW may just not be for you. Unfortunately, raiding is ultimately going to be a barrier of entry for end game material. All of the content patches from here on out are raids (well, save for arathi basin).
---
Make an alt, grind professions, help guildies with low level stuff. That's about it.
---
They take far less damage since their TPS scales off mostly block value they can just stack defense, and can also take the 10 defense from talents. I mean the 8 garr adds are like 5k DPS, so having a deep prot mitigate damage through extra parry,dodge, and just misses from mobs means you need less healers or your healers can do some damage whatever. I am sure its doable as fury they will just require more healing , just like deep prot can easily hold threat with the current gear in the game but with slightly lower DPS.
---
should be ULPT
---
&gt;:)
---
Alliance will still be doing AV, but it'll be more premades going for honor rather than quick drek rep kills. AV is still your best honor/hour for alliance due to the quick queues.
---
^this. Rushing never works now. Never.
---
The spergs on Arugal would have you think otherwise, however. Apparently *this time* it is going to work.
---
I fig this will be the norm for this and maybe next week. 
---
BG/Honor cal fixes/testing and the calculation for each server/faction ranks sucks (from what I remember).  This should get “better” after week 1 of BGs.
---
&gt; Assuming they aren't complete dead weight 
---
I'm confused, in that case it should never go to a ret paladin
---
That's how the spell it in chat - Drak. I'm not kidding.
---
Even if I was completely financially stable without full-time employment and had 0 personal responsibilities I would still never consider this ludicrous grind. It is, frankly, very unhealthy.
---
I had one go almost 1hr this morning, followed by a second that I had to afk out at 30minutes, which not much progress besides the ice lord about to be summoned.
---
I’m sure there are, try joining the server discord and looking for info through there. Also try joining the looking for group chat channel by typing /join LookingForGroup, this is an official LFG global channel that in my opinion makes finding groups for dungeons or questing so much easier. There are still plenty of people out in the world and active, just put yourself out there and I’m sure you’ll find some people to play with!
---
I'll concede that a larger player-base will have an affect on their overall maintenance. The problem seems to be that they still haven't dedicated enough members to the classic team. These aren't issues that should still be happening 15-16 years later.
---
Obviously their largest team should be focused on the upcoming expansion that they plan to make more money from, but having such a small team dedicated to Classic is obviously causing problems. Such as this whole post is iterating.
---
You are right. I forgot that you are not granted to get that spawn every time!
---
:)
---
So running it for 257 is not that unlucky at all... not even running it for 500 times...
---
Somehow I thought that the threadstarter did already care about "I only count the run if the mob spawned".... when he clearly did not
---
NA-West, NA-East, EU?
---
if your server is NA-West that seems reasonable because I bet a bunch of players are 1 or 2 timezones off AKA 1am server is 3am to many and 10am is noon
---
I’d guess phase 3 lands in January.  Phase 4 will be probably be April, phase 5 in September, and phase 6 in January 2021
---
It was never in vanilla, I believe it came out in cataclysm
---
It was not in Vanilla. They added it in whenever they added XP for doing Battlegrounds, since it made thinking impossible without disabling XP.
---
&gt; pick up some hobbies
---
That's what I would refer to WoW as for me atm. I have other Hobbies but I tend to only really focus on 1 at a time, but that's just how I do things. I suppose I'm more of an all-in kinda person. Another Hobby of mine is racing/building RC cars/vehicles. Again, I often will go a year or so without messing with any of it but then it'll become my primary focus as a pasttime. 
---
I suppose what I learned from my comment that we are all different, and based on the majority of responses, I'm surprised my comment is still in the positive. Although I don't ever sell off my old collections/hobbies when I grow tired of them, some can sit on the back burner for quite a while before I go all-in on them again.
---
Bitching player base is a haply player base!
---
/S
---
Very true...and Blizz saying that its going to take 6+ hours is just a buffer estimate. It could do in that amount of time or, sooner. And over the next few weeks, that time will keep decreasing.
---
Why are the servers down for 8 hours again this week?
---
I understand why people are annoyed, it’s justified. My only question is why doesn’t blizzard do maintenance on US servers overnight?  Most companies that do maintenance, do so when there is the least amount of traffic. To take the servers down for the majority of the day into prime traffic hours just seems stupid.
---
You knew full well that they have scheduled maintenance every Tuesday. This isn't a surprise downtime or a sudden dead server that's taking ages to come back online. As another poster pointed out 8 hours on a Tuesday when the majority of the NA population is working anyway is costing you less than 50 cents...
---
Now if only there was some way to trade water to your alts.
---
I miss back in Everquest when you could log your magician, summon up a bag full of stuff and then drop it on the ground for your alt to come pick up.
---
Gear Menu is a bit better IMO and you can use it for any slot, makes swapping items for pvp much easier.
---
Um... 
---
You must be a special kind of stupid for this to be your train of thought.
---
not in AV
---
It's a fucking multi BILLION dollar company.
---
Do you understand how much money they make every year? it's fucking nuts, your family would be set for life  if you made 1% of what they made for a week.
---
They make more money in a week than 99% of us will see in our entire lives, but yes, we defend the small and weak blizzard from the harsh words.
---
They are a MULTI BILLION DOLLAR COMPANY, 8 hours of downtime on a paid service during day hours in unacceptable.
---
What do winning battles gain from 1 more fighter on a field of millions?
---
I was just talking about classic. I had a day long AV in Vanilla, still didn't finish it.
---
I remember complaining hard about how shit the design of AV was when it released back in actual vanilla, it is good to see that this is still true. I wouldn't change it for the world now, what's done is done, but this would be such a different BG if they only made it so you're required to wait 30s on death instead of sometimes you luck into a quick res.
---
It was like this through WotLK too, when I started grinding the game. Its when I learned to not be sick on tuesdays anymore
---
easy, go sell a page of water for 1g , then log over and go buy a page of water for 1g ;p
---
Night owl prime time?? 
---
ROFL
---
People would fucking riot.
---
down for 1/3 of 1 day of the week**
---
It's all good no one's knows everything this is how we learn
---
Is it confirmed that frost power doesn’t stack with arcane elixir?
---
That is of course assuming you grind the instance until even good items get DEd. What I say makes perfect sense if you don't presume that.
---
As of thousands of people aren’t pissed of at the downtime right now? How selfish of you
---
Yeah all your aggro is based on consecration and reflected holy damage. Seal of Righteousness is great for single target aggro.
---
 Love paladin taking in dungeons as an aoe mage. &lt;333
---
Don't feel bad, some of them are worthless. You probably sold a worthless one.
---
Report them in the forums or your server's sub. It's not the ultimate solution, but it's something.
---
As a passably geared holy priest (mostly pre-bis, a few epics), I regen roughly 100 mana per tick when not casting.  Even if that was ALL from spirit (it's not) and even if I manage to double that regen in T2 (I won't) the T2 set bonus would only be worth 30 mp5.
---
If you're shadow, odds are you'll be prioritizing gear with a lot less spirit than this, so realistically the set bonus is probably only worth like 10-15 mp5 for a shadow priest.  There is absolutely no way that this paltry amount of mp5 is worth losing spell damage, hit, and/or crit.
---
Ha, but seriously... people don't even wait for honorless target debuff to fade before ganking. The game is so toxic now with all these exploits... you can be a total dick. Bliz will need to make the call to accept sub loss as just part of how toxic the game is... or make some changes to keep it from being so utterly joyless for the people being camped / griefed.
---
Last night... a guild was camping BRD / MC. Flight path. Ganked. Route to BRD. Ganked. BRD choke point doors. Ganked. Jump down by MC. Ganked. Door to BRD. Ganked. Took me 2 hours to get in. Just a miserable existence. And yeah, we were logging out and logging back in so when we came up we had honorless target... 0 fucks given by griefers. They're not out for honor, they're just out to shit on your night.
---
this used to be standard
---
i say keep it
---
Bots are cancer.
---
Traitor!!
---
For The Horde!
---
"32.3%.. repeating of course"
---
The greatest rewards require the greatest sacrifice. Realistically you're looking at 16-20 hour days to get 14. I won't get that, if I push really hard I might be able to get to 10, but right now I'm averaging bracket 7-8 consistently (still only rank 5 though).
---
Yeah, "I don't like the treadmill". That's all MMO's are. 
---
Get to max level. Get gear to do more difficult content to get gear to do more difficult content, ad infinitum.
---
Yeah, that was the cool thing.  In AV you could be PVE spec and perform really well.  It meant even more in the 1.8? version of AV I played along side AQ progression.  People that had defensive talents or raid gear on were really key to overturning a graveyard or bunker.
---
You're right. I forgot that Kalgan was an actual Dev for several years at Origin.
---
They have to take the hard drives out and blow in them to clean the dust out
---
The idea is to have a spec for both raiding, dungeons and farming smartass. I know arms cleave harder.
---
Honestly... if they are having fun doing that grind all the power to them. I for one can't wait until I get exalted so I can do WSG as I prefer it a lot more to AV. AV is fun, don't get me wrong, but it's too... I dunno... blah.
---
This isn't a hill you want to die on, you can't stop them, they wont stop, let them rage themselves into an early grave nothing of value was lost.
---
So my friends and I just joined a relatively inexperienced, smaller guild. Have not done any raiding outside of UBRS. Joining this guild, we realized they are going to be leaning on us for support in moving forward, which we’re happy to do. 
---
My question is in how to proceed. If we only have around 20-25 “raid-ready” players, then is that enough to start doing some MC trash runs on our own? Or should we focus on starting to down some bosses while pugging the other 15-20ish people? Just want some insight or advice in how to move this guild forward into MC, outside of our obvious need for more people. Just moreso in the short term. Appreciate any guidance!
---
I'm asking a simple question. No hate intended.
---
its so funny how all these people come up to me and beg me to stop getting honor... "wahhh ur messing up the brackets!" tough shit LOL! im just that good at pvp, its all natural baby!
---
some guys got it.... others don't! way she goes fellas
---
I'm looking for more of a open discussion on the matter. Then a stop to all talk about any changes with a simple line.
---
Lol, no. A good deep prot warrior can hold aggro over 1000 dps alliance side and 800 ish dps horde side. Most prot warriors suck and can't hold aggro and are using fury prot are a bandaid.  
---
The only people who need to be fury prot are those with dps pushing 1k+. The rest are just a bunch of scrubs who can't do the rotation in deep prot so they are stealing dps gear as a crutch.
---
I'm confused. So after 2 months of trying, you manage to get to the last room, but you don't attempt the boss? That's the reason you're there! And it's the easiest part. Which bit are you stuck on and maybe I can help?
---
Don't forget that a large portion of those who are in bracket one are botting and account sharing. At least on my server they are.
---
What experience do you have in the industry that gives you the certainty to say that?
---
Every time I've encountered someone equating money directly to dev work they're talking out of their ass.
---
&gt;Do you guys not realize that it's actually an advantage that Horde have queue times in AV? 
---
Most people are dumb.  On top of that most people don't understand how the ranking system even works.  You are 100% correct.  Right now anyone doing the AV rank should be pretty thankful there is a q.  The q is only annoying if you are playing for fun, which people aren't really doing much of now.
---
Laptop on the toilet, ya filthy casual.
---
&gt; Nowadays every fucking Casualscrub knows his BiS Lists, random guidless people run around with Bonereavers Edge
---
I hear ya man... It is funny to watch honestly.
---
&gt;We have seen blizzard approach PVE in similar fashion with mythic level difficulitys in retail that are made only for the .5% of top PVE players.
---
This is so incredibly wrong
---
I never said they were promised. I assumed most of the downvotes I would get would be from TBC lovers. Are most of the people down voting me because they don't understand the difference between saying something has promise and saying something was promised?
---
This is great, it's important to check out the flaws in addons to ensure that the data the community is relying on is accurate. Hopefully the developer of HonorSpy can determine a better method in securing this.
---
And botting. Lots of bots on my server.
---
Hey buddy im curious about this build. Will you share the macro? Would really appreciate.
---
Have you.... have you seen the meta of BGS?
---
ES has a 12% proc rate, it's actually unfair.
---
It's also the version that almost every single person wanted. Every private server is based on 1.12.
---
&gt; I don't know why they put it in or why people defend Blizz.
---
Probably because it was the cheapest and easiest solution.
---
No they didn't? At least not that I can ever recall, was always Tuesday evenings for us over here in Aus, maybe a couple of hours earlier?
---
(Sorry you got downvoted, but this is an inside joke on Grobb, you should look it up)
---
You might not find it fun, but many others do. Its engaging, and requires (at least for me) more attention to what is happening with the pull, the group, and any adds that may be near. IF, thats a really big if, someone pulls threat and requires an intercept, it isnt hard to quickly swap to zerker, Bloodrage then intercept.
---
Ideally, this shouldn't be a situation that'll occur. Everyone has their roles, and what dps/healers sometimes forget is part of their role is to manage their threat. Additionally, the tank shouldn't be chasing down targets. This can easily wipe the group/raid depending on the mobs being fought. It also severely hampers melee DPS (or hunters if you're running INTO their deadzone), so its better to bring that mob to the tank so they don't have to go anywhere or use intercept.
---
I do think that Classic + would have to incorporate some type of Arena / Rated battlegrounds . Even for Just classic atm i feel that the longevity of the game could be vastly improved by adding a ranking system
---
For people doing the Rank 14 grind it has to be the best day ever.
---
There is a blue post admitting the missing honor is real.
---
Please have patience. A small indie company like Activision-Blizzard can't afford a proper support team. They're doing their best.
---
Shit, is that the only lantern in the game?
---
I love how you’re calling everyone selfish....someone does it to you, and this is your response. Classic reddit loser with zero social skills
---
Definitely yes. Lobotomizer is a good upgrade to Darrowspike.
---
Also: whenever one makes such a purchase, the other item is guaranteed to drop, because Murphy's Law etc :D
---
Correct, after 4 failed attempts I ran to my bank and happily, I saved the yeti. An hour later my Anathema was conjured. The yeti made holy nova/strat water irrelevant, didn't even have any buffs on me on the yeti attempt - finished on the 4th wave too.
---
Alliance hunter isn’t using his brain to see that a priest is the one being a «cunt», whats new
---
How about a vendor / auction house mount to. Lol, jk, I don't like playing vs premades so I only bg on my lvl 47.
---
 some dude on ours honorspy showing 9m. Idk how
---
But what is there to discuss if the answer really is just as simple as one line?
---
You can't have 8 women create 1 baby in a month, no matter how often or hard you fuck them. Some problems can't be fixed by throwing more money or people at it, especially when dealing with a legacy codebase.
---
This is some weird ass sinophobia
---
Well if you know how turn ins work no, it really only takes 20 or so loots to finish most of the turn ins.
---
Yes 3 8 minute wins... Horde INTENTIONALLY turtle it almost every game now, why? Cause it's not fun waiting 66% of the time your playing a game. Their ques are like 15 minutes.  If alliance won every single time with the galv race and then killing drek in 8 minute then yes your way is faster.  BUT if one game 33% of the time the horde successfully defends then your way is screwed.
---
I've played horse most of my life, and they always will teleport back to the base and defend because it's more fun then sitting and waiting to play.
---
Further info: Friendly nameplates do show on players. They also show on my target, whether it's a player or an NPC. It's hard to troubleshoot due to the 2h lockout w/o bothering someone to help me. Googling mainly gets me results simply suggesting I turn them on, hence me asking here.
---
&gt; mythic level difficulitys in retail that are made only for the .5% of top PVE players. 
---
Imagine believing this
---
Like where do you even hear such a thing
---
This fucking guy, raging chomping at the bit over this MILLION DOLLAR COMPANY!  having downtime for routine maintenance and on the back end just ranting about  COMPANIES DISRESPECT ME FUCK THEM MAKE THEM WORK 24/7.
---
Just report/block this angry asinine troll.
---
Absolutely, no joke, the Sunwell patch killed my guild. Not because we crashed on Sunwell, but because were were late comers who had just downed Vash and were working on Kael when the massive raid nerfs dropped. All of that feeling of progress and working together to get better was just thrown out as the game became massively easier and they just handed you access to BT and Hyjal. We raided once the first week after the patch, then everybody just disappeared out of disappointment.
---
I dont know what you're talking about when you say its made it less social. Its made it more social for me. 
---
Theres a discord floating around with 500-1000 alliance members in it that have about 200-300 people queueing at any given time doing premades. Meet a lot of people, get to chat with different people each game, and it was probably the most enjoyable AV experience I've ever had.
---
You may be able to kill the lashers in 8 min, and thats a good time, but, your route isn't the best in terms of getting the herbs on the ground and the tubers. Even if your not a herbalist, those tubers on the ground net on average 2g~ish per run because they drop in stacks of 5-10 per pod.
---
If you pay taxes, or contribute to health care pool you are 100% giving as much or more money to Aetna/ Phizer through medicaid/medicare contributions and Exxon/Goldman/BoA through general taxes corporate handouts/interest free loans.
---
That said, there is something to the fact that you are willingly picking to give money to Activision whereas the money you're likely indirectly contributing to the others has little to no element of choice
---
Can you give an example of when it won't Because atm the majority of people I know are just farming AV every day as much as possible to make it into the top rank position. Maybe if WSG was more honor but currently that is not the case
---
Could they have communicated it better?  Yes absolutely, sometimes shit takes time.  Ever done a large data migration?  Shit ever change someones email from Exchange 2010, to Exchange 2016?  IT shit can take HOURS no matter how much money you throw at it. 
---
On top of this would you rather them take the time they need to QA things, or just fucking patch it and fire it back up so you can complain about the problems that causes?
---
Wake up, money does not necessarily make shit more efficient....  The federal government has a shitload of money too, and yet getting someones signature takes weeks....
---
Yep, I remember those days as well.  Many times they'd even give an announcement about the +1 day credit when the downtime was exceptionally long (like when it'd be down until 7pm EST sorta thing).
---
Last time I checked it still showed those +1 day credits as of a few months ago, it was fun to look at.  I'll check to see if that's still visible somewhere.  But I can 100% promise you they did credit everyone with +1 day and anybody from that time can verify.
---
I’ll make it simple for you, no changes, you want rated bgs? Go to retail.
---
I dont remember R10 to be that hard to achieve. I made it back in vanilla casually on my shaman. About 4hrs daily.
---
Tactical Mastery?
---
5% Parry?
---
Pretty much.
---
Amazingly some people can't no life the game. Im still 12k away from exalted. Honor is my secondary objective right now.
---
Let’s be honest: anyone saying they have a day off is really just unemployed.
---
Not a woosh, just thought your comment was useless.
---
TuF is much better than OEB for PVP.  Even with Sword spec, you are relying on a proc for that damage.  TuF has much higher top end damage so it is guaranteed per-hit damage increase on your target, especially if you are jousting with your target. In addition, the stun proc is extremely useful in PVP.
---
That's the whole sub lately.
---
There are legit instruments you can play in gw2
---
I know this now, thanks.
---
This is weird because nameplates work for me just fine.
---
you write like liking memes makes you a bad person
---
Yeah yeah coil buys you 2 seconds wowee what a game changer. If I was seriously trying to 1v1 a tryhard lock I’d shadow protection during your lip. At the current level of gear in the game you being in greens or bis doesn’t make you live any longer against me popping every cd
---
Name checks out.
---
LEL good meme 100/10
---
Cross-Realm BGS bring out the worst in people...
---
That's not true.  Revered gets rep from all the turn-ins.  
---
What gives rep prior to revered that no longer does after?  I haven't noticed any differences since hitting revered...
---
😂😂😂
---
I can definitely see how the travel system on the Horde benefits leveling and instances. Its funny because I have to ask my guild how to get to somewhere because I'm so use to the other faction and the way of travel. I almost feel like I am playing a new game.
---
Do you work in an office? I suspect not; Though if you do my follow-up will be much easier to understand. So let's start from point A.
---
a deathbringer finally dropped for the first time last week for our guild.  Annnnnd that was the first Ony I went to on my mage instead of my fury warrior.  RIP
---
You and I are basically the same. I went in to this week with 35 honor total. This week I hit exalted with Frostwolf and picked up a little over 250k honor. Let's see what happens. I wouldn't mind ranking a bit, but pvp really is not my thing. I do, however, lover AV and AB, so mid level ranks are possible for me.
---
More than the team is more skilled and accustomed to the codebase they've been actively working on for the past 15 years, instead of the 14-year-old codebase they pulled out of the trash and dusted off.
---
I've done probably 15ish Rag attempts now, most of them successes. I've died in 3-4 of them, despite GFPPs. The pots *generally* work, the problem is that unlucky fireball RNG can still kill you, particularly if some of your raid doesn't position well. I've had some guy run by me to get back to his original position, he got hit, I got blasted directly into a second fireball and then into the lava. Dead. 
---
My suggestion would be to get what FR you can without giving up significant damage. It's relevant for the hardest fights we currently have, and will be relevant in some BWL fights as well. Specific suggestions:
---
1. Dire Maul libram enchants to head and leg. Sacrifices 16 int for 40 FR. Small drop in damage, meaningful survivability buff.
---
2. 7 FR to cloak. Not giving up anything I know of.
---
3. Dragonrider boots instead of Omnicast. You lose 4 spell damage and 1 stam, gain 7 int and 10 FR. 
---
4. If you have any "bad" pieces of gear remaining, swap them out for FR. Trinkets and rings in particular tend to be harder to get on a mage. If you're using an int ring, or carrot on a stick, swap those out for things like tidal loop, blazing emblem, etc. 
---
5. If you want to drop some cash, Elemental Mage Staff is basically equivalent to pre-BiS damage and gives you an extra 20FR. 
---
In short: it should be easy to get an extra 67 FR, and up to 95ish if you really want. You'll survive an extra unlucky fight or two, and on the lucky fights, save some money by needing 1 GFPP instead of 2-3.
---
ok anime irl
---
Yes I didn’t know this was my server amazing!!
---
My nice small guild was disbanded because it got too small and the gm wasn't playing anymore so we were taken in by a guild we had been raiding with for a month. There were 200 people in the guild when came came over and in the last week there have been over three hundred people signed up. It sucks, stupid people posting stupid shit in gchat and causing drama. I miss my small guild of people who knew each other and took care of each other.
---
Yes. No one is buying tribute items anymore and if they are it is not going to be more than 20g....and it'll take them a bit to get there. As a hunter who does 11mins runs I'm not waiting for anything less than 35
---
 So the top .5 % was wrong but given these clear rates it shows that the majority of players never experience clearing mythic difficulty 
---
For Reference based on Wowprog here are the clear rates of these expansions Raids.

My last game was pretty awesome but was only around 35 minutes which I think is one of my longest. Biggest annoyance was the 3 who didn't get kicked for fishing after the first 5 minutes when ally took both towers and graveyards while offence was thin and facing a bit of a turtle at the bridge because someone capped SH GY. Screw those guys and wanting to give up. We pressed on and won anyways.
---
Life was hard. Ally even capped both GY and destroyed both towers. Our defence wiped them on Drek and retook both GY. Gave us enough time on offence to wipe twice on marshals and once on Vann. I was the only "healer" and as an ele spec I'm not super great at it and oom super fast. Basically I had to let a tank die each pull because I couldn't heal both allowing 1 marshal to run wild through our group of 15ish. 
---
There were 2 other ele shams next to me but they seemed to have never bough healing spells since they offered me no back up when I asked for help on healing or when I went oom.
---
All in all it was a great match that I wish was more common. (Outside of the 3 who gave up.)
---
You will farm more doing an "inefficient farm" for 5 hours that you enjoy than you will doing a high stress "efficient farm" for 1 hour.
---
Forget hunters, try MC pre 1.11, 1.11 you just handed all your mages +6% to hit. That is the stone cold nuts. Oh and not to mention fury dps didn't even exist until 1.6 when BWL was recent, and wasn't even really relevant till 1.9 when they buffed BT to 45%AP. Not to mention the access to +spell damage gear casters have. When 1.6 was out, nearly the only spell damage you could get in the game was that +23 bonus from your T0 set. Now Banthok sash [et.al](https://et.al) is a thing. Not rebalancing MC around the 1.12 itemization, EVEN phase 1 itemization, was an epic fail.
---
I've played horde most of my life, and they always will teleport back to the base and defend because it's more fun then sitting and waiting to play. All it takes is one backcap to screw the alliance
---
I’m not being selfish. I’m advocating patience for a better gameplay experience for everyone. Most issues with the game don’t concern me or affect me as much as others. That absolutely isn’t selfish. Do you understand that word, or just mentally stunted with a “takes one to know one” mindset?
---
At what point did I say "idgaf if the honor system is breaks and everyone has a shit gaming/pvp experience, I want to play on Tuesday mornings!"
---
You are reaching so fuckin hard for something it's sad.
---
But that's what makes him such a good character. Despite the plot hook of the evil crown taking control of him, you could still empathize with Arthas and his decisions. It's just really good writing for the morally grey areas.
---
Why would he be using fire spells in MC?
---
It doesn't really matter who was their first. No one owns a farming spot.
---
If someone in Azeroth works full-time on a low-class job (say, 10 gold per hour), then they earn 2200 gold a month. I'd think prostitution would be more expensive in such world.
---
reddit mods have to justify their worthless existence somehow
---
I honestly thought this was sarcasm before I read your replies. lol
---
Thanks for the tip! I'll do that quest before my next attempt and let you know.  :)
---
&gt;So I ask the question of why are rated bgs not an option?
---
because it's a retail's feature. and people on this sub hate anything retail-related
---
then you are asking the wrong question. the question you have asked is answered in one line.
---
the question you should be asking is: "why cant we have changes?"
---
then you will have your discussion.
---
Bots are banned in waves so they can get as many as possible without the people who make bots being able to fix whatever made Blizzard find them.   
---
Blizzard aren't the only ones who does this, most games where people bot does something like it.
---
I definitely wish more folks engaged in world pvp. Seeing horde camping IF for weeks is the “careful what you wish for” of this. Super content with the decision to roll PvE.
---
Might need to delete your wtf and interface folders (or rename so you can restore them) beca your settings should work
---
Pretty sure you’d have to put the loot on FFA before you pull to sell the leaf out of the chest
---
I never looked up to anyone in a video game, aside from that some people enjoy the journey and some enjoy the destination, it's a game and it matters very little how other's think you should play.
---
Bullshit
---
I am having this same issue. Not at home now but I will check the GPU settings perhaps it defaulted to onboard. Using an older Alienware Laptop with Windows 7.
---
Even as a Human Mage you'll be better off than tons of classes in many situations. And Peception can be a huge advantage. Just have to make sure you don't hesitate to use it often. It's not a long cooldown, and doesn't help you at all after they open. Even if you suspect a stealther is neaby or are close to capping a flag or taking a base, use it early and often!
---
Nothing at all wrong with a Human Mage. You should be way more worried about improving your skill than missing a skill you never had.
---
like 6g on my server. I had about 5g at lv 20. So just not worth it.
---
Had Skullflame Shield drop in one of my AVs yesterday.
---
This is at best an example of ignorance, and at worse just sheer stupidity.  QA takes time, and when they rush everyone loses their shit about that.  They are damned if they do, and damned if they don't.
---
I feel like it could have been communicated better.  There are too many variables involved to just assume that being stingy with money is the issue here.  
---
IT shit can take time...  Example:  I had an SQL query I ran for a customer looking for a patient number from within millions of pictures, on a hot(being used) database.  It ran for 36hrs before yielding results.
---
I'm on Skeram Alliance, And the top level bracket is determined by who plays the most and receives the most honor. I'm not discrediting WSG premades currently. I'm just looking at it from a competitive aspect and again most WSG premades are just stomping pugs all day for honor.

\#nochanges

But that can't happen as long as blizzard stick to their hypocrisy of "no change". I wish people would understand Classic is NOT Vanilla and just let them make it a better experience than Vanilla really was.

China censors everything tho
---
The ease of horde leveling is summed up as: Monastery; Zeps. I hated that as alliance getting to SM was such a damn chore. And the horde had BFD, RFK, RFD, SM all in their backdoor. Gnomer sucks and isn't worth comparing.
---
.... i don´t even know what to feel
---
Of course I do. Go test it for yourself instead of pretending to have 400IQ. 
---
But given you only have 400 IQ, you probably don't know how to do that... So here is how:
---
1. Make a stopattack macro with your sunder armor.
---
2. Activate recklessness. 
---
3. Use bloodthirst.
---
4. Use sunder armor with stopattack and be amazed that  you now have a flurry buff for your next 3 attacks or 12 seconds ;)
---
5. Come back to me and tell me that i am your overlord in WoW and you are not worthy.
---
6. ???
---
7. Profit!
---
Oh that's what i'm getting at and I know, I lost a lot of 3am to 8am kills and got a random half rank boost later on a result.
---
If it's slightly inconvenient downtimes or scuffed ranks I take downtimes 10/10
---
\#NoChanges
---
This is how it was before TBC.
---
It's not true at all. 3 pulls is pretty good. I do 15ish minutes resets, so your statement is just imaginable.
---
Sure, but it doesn't change the fact that blizzard is hypocritical and sticking to their "no change".
---
I was curious if I would get this comment \^\^

The rag neck is of course much better for caster dps, no objection there. But we are not talking about a progress focussed guild run, trying to optimize their roster, but a pug with simple loot rules, where being a huge upgrade for my main specc, and technically being bis (even if only by a small margin) qualifies me for rolling imo.
---
Now if I had won and the raidleaders are like "we won't give that to a healer", I wouldn't even be mad or anything. But rolling for it within the loot rules of the pug, no, not ashamed of myself at all :p
---
Go do something else you fragile boy. Wasting your day off crying on reddit as a grown dude. Yikes.
---
The only complaining I see is on reddit and wow fourms, everyone in game is enjoying themselves.
---
Probably addressing issues/bugs from last week.
---
But as horde when I go take a poop and come back to see missed the queue I have to wait in another 15 min queue :(
---
They are trying to fix the honor system. Which they won't. Because they didn't prepare well enough and are probably honestly behind 100's of man-hours behind in development. Blizzard proving again and again how woefully underprepared they were for Classic.
---
It is so boring at lvl 60 i cant bring myself to log in
---
The people working on classic make the same amount of money as us lmao.
---
Imagine thinking a billion dollar company swings their billion dollar dick at every single project that ever existed.
---
What a fucking memer.
---
NOOOO! YOU CAN'T TEMPT ME BY BRINGING MY MAIN GAME OFFLINE!
---
I think he's saying that all the toxicity is here.....  408k subscribers to this sub, and millions playing the game... Well not today, but you know what I mean...
---
Might be partially due to how much more logic the honour update is going to require
---
The hit \~ sp ratio changes based on your gear. There are plenty of sims out there where you can check the math.
---
For my lock with 440sp, +3hit, and +11.37crit, then one hit is roughly 13sp.
---
I understand but I mean still who does that
---
I would say mage is really the last class that needs fire resist on rag. As a frost mage, the ragnaros fight is made for you. If you have a details! or a similar addon, check how much damage mages prevent with just their skills, it's quite impressive.
---
I really don't think there's gonna be a ton of people who don't already play retail that would go over to it. Shadowlands looks interesting, but thats the future, and current retail has no appeal to myself.
---
Sounds like he was just assuming he had prio on drop without really asking or being told that?  If one of your rets had the hammer already I think you clearly made the right choice. 
---
Performance should count in LC decisions, but it's not everything.  If a raid member thinks they are prio or should be prio they should speak up and confirm.  LC typically doesn't have single hard and fast rules like "eye goes to top DPS, period."  
---
Loot drama is inevitable, and its better to have loot drama than no loot drop in the first place IMO.
---
Yeahhhh right now freezing rain is coming down and everything is covered in a layer of ice. Going out for a walk is gonna be a hard pass today.
---
It's pretty ridiculous too. AV hasn't even been out for a full week yet and people say "casuals" should be exalted.
---
Shit... I play a bit more than a casual would vs. a hardcore and it still takes ~30 hrs at least of game time to make the climb. Doing that in a single week is goddamn crazy for a "casual"
---
wsg rep grind ain't a joke like av
---
Sorry that happened to you. You are never stuck! If you feel bored and want something different reroll and start again. Maybe with a new class to ward away from the warrior grind. Personally I enjoy the challenge of starting new, I feel like it allows me to play the game without a crutch. When I leveled my alts, I tried not to aid them, with bags, gold, and gear, I attempted to keep it as "organic" as possible, even in retail.
---
This. People seem to be so confused and disgusted about this. It’s been this way since week 1.
---
Literally any server in the game lolb
---
r/NormMacdonald
---
it meant that in vanilla too
---
oh, understand.
---
I'm just arguing that in addition to maintenance aspect, Blizzard has no  incentive to try to shorten these downtimes.
---
Actually that’s pretty accurate. 
---
Maybe pay attention to your own contribution instead of criticizing others.
---
People on Reddit don't read the words you typed in context.  They read everything through the lense of their whatever crazy shit they believe in.
---
So you want to pick and choose which versions to go with variably depending on which aspect of the game? Who gets to decide this and the rules?
---
Watch strategy videos instead, if its your first time.
---
&gt;Activate recklessness.
---
&gt;Use bloodthirst.
---
This gives you flurry, yes. What is your point? And please at least try to be civil and say what you want to say, instead of lashing out. It's embarrassing to read.
---
Well youre either doing real life chores or virtual chores
---
I think for this you need to have the boss targeted.
---
80s for a SINGLE stack of mage water? God damn. At those rates he should be filthy fucking rich.
---
No chance of banging out all the adulting you must do for the rest of the day, and coming back @ 3pm PST?
---
Great video. Couple questions - is it worth doing without herbalism? Also, some have pointed out that there are 2 spawn locations for books - have you ever found any?
---
For anyone who read that it would be a 1 hour maintenance, it is a surprise.
---
This is also a thought, Something that exist in classic that currently does not in retail is twinking. The possiblity of a level 19/29/39/49 twink bg ranking system would be super fun and there is already a ton of people who enjoy twinking.
---
Assuming you're a healer so Gloves or Restoration, I don't see fire res being an issue for you. Bring the others with you if you want in case the leaders start asking everyone to fire res up, but I've never had to as a resto druid
---
Thanks, i check these things out better because i never heard of these.
---
lol nicely done homie!
---
I'll be cheering you on from work all day
---
If your guild works with other guilds on the server to maintain Ony head time it’s extremely annoying :/
---
To elaborate, when Vanilla came out and we were playing it those blank spots on the maps excited people because Azeroth was a living world that was going to continue to be fleshed out. People found ways to get into Hyjal and other areas to try to get a glimpse of what the future would hold. 
---
Then TBC came out and most of that expansion was leaving Azeroth behind. It didn't expand much of Azeroth at all. It literally left the world behind, and all these little zones continued to sit empty.
---
Maintenance days have always been hours
---
Haha I appreciate the skepticism, but this was genuine just a nice thing that happened to me. I'll post my realm character screen when I get back from work to verify.
---
&gt;dealing with even more hours of gameplay problems
---
What problems?
---
So what? They randomly hire and train or rip people from other projects during Q4 that still need time to ramp up? You realize people take vacations right now and staff gets short handed? Way too much fucking complaining its pathetic. Sorry the BMW isnt the m model or the color you wanted sarah.
---
That Blizzard-Activision can do whatever they want and we will still buy a subscription because our friends also play wow.
---
I only found out a few days ago which is why i'm rushing to R3. Some of my guildies hit exalted and found out it was over 700g for the mount as they where only Grunt or Scout.
---
Had 2 in the same day on Tuesday! Craziness.
---
Yeah let’s be real here, they are probably more sane than most due to the lovely bots/accounting sharing.
---
Better yet, queue some island expeditions and then immediately lighter fluid
---
I miss wvw on gw2
---
I tried for 2 weeks to get a witchblade in Scholomance. Then the second time it dropped a priest rolled need on it on a whim because she might try shadow priest. Been a month, I'm just there for the rep now - no sense trying to go for specific drops because Murphy will just say no.
---
The stun proc is almost actively bad since it DRs mace spec. However ur point about the top end is very true, id say they are close. My preference would be OEB but i totally understand why people like TuF better
---
this isn’t possible, someone told me all games are 7 minutes and there’s no PvP!
---
All the WoW classic forums are highly toxic and vocal.  JUst play. Look for a guild that meets your needs and then avoid barrens chat/trade unless you really need them or can be objective.   I found a guild made up of older returning players and the core of the guild is great....we have recruited some bad eggs but they move on...usually people who expect/demand to be leveled or carried through content too high for their levels. The guild gives new lowbie members large bags and some green gear upgrades for their class...maybe some mats to level a craft.  
---
I'm having a great time with classic and focusing on my goals most of the time and helping out some people along the way with their class quests or just getting over a hump or clearing aout an elite quest in the regular game world.
---
Or. How about this.
---
They don't release something that is fucking broken. 
---
They don't have to then take servers offline to fix a pile of shit they just fucking threw into the system. Id rather have had an extra month or two without BGs than for them to be in full on fucking panic meltdown mode trying to hotfix things and figure out from the outside in what is going wrong. Take the time and fucking do it right, one time. Not botched and rebotched and rebotched. 
---
It's just not the professional way to handle this at all. It's ridiculous. They knew it was broken. They know it's broken. So why is it in the game.
---
I can’t wait for season 2!!
---
This.
---
Someone who isn't me has been catching some fish in AV, he says the catch is not very special. The best thing he caught was some nightfin snappers.
---
Troll for horde. Only misses lock and druid I guess.
---
Ally... Human? No hunters or druid.
---
Coolest ofc would be a cow only cow guild.
---
that's weird, I play on the most populated server and I recognize sooo many people on my faction no matter where I go &amp; also quite a few alliance players as well.
---
that sounds very familiar to a game i just had, was it about an hour before the reset? 0 priests, lots of shamans
---
I had the pleasure to meet, and house a Finish student for a week, it is really awesome what your ppl did with the education, there is a video where an american student-stuff presidentish guy goes to Finlans and got amazed by how much it is advanced to all the other 80 year old systems.     
---
We have plans to move there with my SO, but it is more like a dream :D
---
SovietWomble vibes, which is pretty nice.
---
Listen here matey downtime between 3-9 am is not unreasonable, its when humans should be asleep, when 3 am on a Tuesday hits, I'm a gamer, I'm not asleep, I go play something else, go to bed at 5am, wake up at 1 pm and the game is back online. Do the same.
---
The servers will be up like 3 hours before they say they will.
---
yeah but in a very long game new people keep coming in
---
They do, but you probably have an addon that bypasses that, i've noticed that almost any addon that changes the tooltip you get when mousing over a player seems to make it say their real race instead of costumed race
---
The other one that helped a lot for a couple Priests in our guild was to have the Oil of Immolation handy - damage every 3 seconds for 15 seconds to mobs within a certain distance.
---
lol. Adds BGs early to make people happy, shits broken, people are upset. Never ending cycle in the world of video games.
---
I think it's different for CoDs; my mailbox says 2 days and he sent it through last night.
---
A) the end boss of mythic raid isn’t mythic difficulty, and
---
B) no, that’s still wrong
---
If your head gasket blows in your car. Can you get mad at the mechanic for how long it takes for him to fix it? It’s just the way it goes. Things take time in life. They’re not obligated to give us every detail.
---
I got destroyed yesterday. As alliance we won 5 lost 16. Was pretty damn fun though :)
---
&gt; the difference between saying something has promise and saying something was promised? 
---
You phrased it as a promise, not the promise.
---
There is a sub specifically for Wow memes.
---
Just pick the option to load out-of-date addons. Most addons weren't affected by the latest update.
---
I haven't but using the IPs on [this page](https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/7870), I get 160ms to US west and 119ms to US east (from helsinki)
---
Could I get that WA too?
---
So you're saying that the mage is OK passing as long as it's not his bis gear. You don't see how that's going to be an issue with something actually substantial drops like choker of the firelord or toep?
---
What about when BWL hits? You don't think there is going to be a fucking meltdown among warlocks and mages if a boomkin gets Neltharion's tear over them?
---
Thought you were boycotting Blizzard?
---
It said one hour last night but then today it changed to 8
---
Sweet. I'm an astronaut.
---
Ever heard of PVP?
---
I don't have anything against the idea of having a leaderboard with competitive BG's, but I don't want actual rewards for doing so.
---
Anyway, it wasn't in vanilla, we asked for vanlla. And the entire of having these kind of.. skill show up things, is 100% retail mentality. Vanilla wow isn't about being the best.
---
It's funny you say that because for the first months of this 3 month game, the mobs *weren't spawning fast enough.* anything that spawned was dead in half a second.
---
Arena I personally believe is not possible in Classic. the game is far to role based and a clear meta would form quickly. Rated bgs on the other had have a large room for advancement of a meta having 10 or 15 slots to change around to deal with different comps would be something ever changing. Rated bgs would have a healthy meta.
---
[WoWHead has a guide](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/alterac-valley-battleground-classic-wow#gaining-reputation-in-alterac-valley) with detailed information about rep gains.
---
It's almost 2020, I can't imagine still using "imagine X" as an insult format
---
Go to retail.
---
No, seriously. The reason horde prolong AV games is because it is virtually the ONLY way to win as horde. Classic AV has a flawed design that favors the alliance if the game is short. So you are essentially complaining about horde playing AV as it was designed in Classic, thus my response is "go to retail".
---
THISSSSSS. It’s not skill to get ranks now. It’s all who has the most time. Skill optional
---
Send me your Corel file so I can make some for my tree! ♥️
---
I mean....it really does work either way. My way (totally intended, dont @ me) actually could be argued to be a much worse form of stupidity.
---
Please read the instruction file, like seriously open it and read to understand how to set it up. Made that while waiting for BGs as I couldnt force myself to go and farm golds. Feel free to use, modify, evolve, hate, share and ask questions that are probably answered in the readme file.

They don't make you a bad person. They also do not contribute anything positive to a sub.

Karens. Karens everywhere. They’d like to speak to a manager. No, the regional manager.

Yeah. Wow players are the bitchiest fanbase ever.

Legends say this battle started over a battlecry of "Taiwan #1"
---
If he has an alliance and a 60 horde then doesn't that mean your server is PvE and he couldn't gank you if you simply turned your pvp flag off?
---
I was thinking about getting this chest piece too since it has 1% crit and 20 agility which is another 1% crit and dodge on top of that plus the stam and strength. It’s comparable to Deathdealer if not better. I think people sleep on this when they only see the 1% crit and either don’t know the 20 agi is another crit for warriors.
---
A client and backend jury-rigged to work with and replicate a 14-year-old version of the game. There are definitely unforeseen issues with each rollout.
---
I like sorrow hill. Alliance side beside chillwind. 
---
Nice slow pulls. Good cloth and grey's. 
---
The odd green and now that BGs are open. Less ganking. 
---
Plus argent dawn rep.
---
Is there a SPit co-efficient?
---
So being quiet and letting it go by without any indication of the impact it had, it will be addressed and handled better next time?
---
No. That's not how it works. Honestly you're daft if this is the way you think. The world would still have Coloured Only water fountains if your ideology was the common one. 
---
Your ideology is just wrong, friend. I don't mean to upset you, but here. You are wrong.
---
Best solution for priest : Go herb/tailoring first. Herbs are great money on most servers and tailoring creates the BIS chest for priest in truefaith vestments. After you have obtained the TFV respec alchemy. Or create an alt with alchemy and something else to make your potions, and than you can go Herb/Mining on priest for more money. You will find tons of nodes when farming herbs, also get a macro for switching herb finding and node finding and get a gathering add on : ) Good luck. Best case scenerio is alt with alchemy, and ditching tailoring after TFV for mining or some other money maker.
---
Mob rule is awesome! Right?
---
Some are professional gamers (people who literally get paid to play WoW and will get increasing rewards if they have super rare stuff like rank 14), others aspire to become professional gamers (not my cup of tea but more power to them), others just have no life.
---
How do you do an AV premade??? My friends and I queue for the same AV and it will still put us in different games lol.
---
It's only gay if you push back
---
&gt; 8 hours maintenance with no notice
---
They announce it before it happens every Tuesday.
---
&gt; random downtimes
---
Downtime is *literally* every Tuesday. Not even close to random.
---
Every rank above me is a no life try hatd
---
Ever rank below me is a shit ass scrub noob
---
If you're using lips to beat someone you're a bad player
---
We had our first Viskagg drop on sunday after over two months of clearing onyxia with 2-3 groups... Still no DB.
---
I was thinking it’s a bit more too, but I don’t have any facts or research that proves it either way. But I agree, there’s a lot of people who are just grinding rep and it just so happens that they also get honor at the same time. The whole system is thrown off
---
woof, check the mirror bud...
---
One of the guys in my guild who's grinding hard as fuck apparently does some kind of consulting work and works entirely from home over the phone/internet. Dude is online all fucking day every day and has been one of the top standings on our server since the honor system came out. Oh and he's a ret pally with nearly full bis including hand of rag.
---
Oh no, there's a third one.
---
And a fourth one.
---
And a fifth one.
---
LOL!
---
As a trigger-happy charging warrior, I usually see the third, fourth, and fifth one only after I've engaged :-o
---
6pm? No...
---
But he honestly doesn't care anymore!
---
Do it anyway. Most GMs of respectable guilds are actually super allergic to this kind of behaviour, too, and will take action based on this and at least question the guy.
---
Just do /ignore. Should work wonders
---
You can solo DMT with almost no gear at all but the learning curve is steep. It also has many items that are huge upgrades for fresh 60s. 2x tarnished rings, barb blade and ogre forged hauberk.
---
Don't plan on using it myself, but I think it looks pretty nice!
---
Because you're making them leave the BG, giving them deserter and removing their rewards for participating in said BG. It's essentially griefing.
---
so you're the asshole always ruining the hordes chances of winning in av, play or get out of av there is no way you're actually contributing in AV AND playing a fps
---
This gave me a lot of laughs - thanks!
---
I am not sure this is worth my time. You are the one gimping your raid with spamming hs over sunder, not me. When I prove you wrong will you record a video of yourself saying that you are not worthy and I am your overlord in WoW?
---
They must be gold farming in the mines.
---
Auction House spec need roll
---
Seargant Frankytomato sure do sell the best frogs in all of Azeroth
---
Quest text looks bad with that &lt;**Description**&gt; still in Arial or w/e. Also please get rid of those unsightly Blizzard borders 🤮 before calling yourself a UI nerd.
---
I play us west coast and I am in Sicily. I think my ping hovers around 200 it isn’t too bad.
---
Got a source for any of that nonsense?
---
That sounds very niche.  Also problem with classic w/ changes or classic+ is everyone has a huge difference of opinion of what that should be.  I'd love to see AV fixed, but some probably like the current broken one for rep grinding.
---
Healbot have this functionality.  
---
You just need to configure what buffs you need.  
---
As a Priest I added 
---
Solo: Inner Fire, PW:F, Divine Spirit  
---
Party and Raid: PW:F and Divine Spirit
---
This is representative of the world at large, not just WoW.  I assume you know this, but I wanted to shine a light on it....
---
Why the hell is everyone complaining that its longer than usually on the SAME DAY it has been forever? Theyre trying to make sure everything with the next week of honor ranks and what not is correct so that people dont bitch about it, but then you bitch about not being able to play for 5 more hours. I understand some people only have so much time to play the game, but damn go do productive real life things in that time then play in the time you just saved.
---
I distinctly remember having to invite people and form a group inside BGs in vanilla.. am I crazy or was this real?
---
I saw a lot of people spamming those snowballs in Ironforge for like half an hour straight. There were like 5-6 characters in one spot just throwing them every second or two. Maybe there are bugs that needed to be fixed with the holiday event?
---
I'll add this to the list of reasons not to play on PvE servers. Bad enough having some assclown come jack your nodes when you're fighting off mobs. Even worse for them to get on their opposite-faction alt and try to gank you.
---
3% hit pole arm isn’t better bruh
---
Quit fucking whining.
---
From what I gathered the person who was angsty was the second person to come to the spot. While there is no hard and fast rule, we all agree if you come in second and try to force the first guy out you are just being rude. If you are the first guy, and harassing the second guy through aggressive tells, that too is a bit much and may be try to approach it with grace. I have just had too many times where people force you out of your spot that you already had locked down. I rarely have enough time to play the childish games associated with someone so I ended up moving to just salvage my time. Mobs are mobs, no one owns them -- but we should all try to some dignity out in the world. I expect the least, and hope for the best to limit my own anger on these things.
---
He's talking about the duration which is all day compared to the usual 1 hour.
---
Well they've got to do standing updates each week, and now there's a billion players actively participating in the PVP system trying to get their AV exalted.
---
I was farming those jaedenar demons for the demonic runes when a fellow druid comes into farm as well. I didnt think anything of it until he would purposefully take my mobs. (Me a priest with really only wanding and SW pain for tagging).. He would moonfire the mob even after seeing me cast  SW pain.. Some people... So I followed him around after that and just feared all his mobs away from his hurricane when he casted it. He got all pissed and was saying I was the person in the wrong, even after letting him know he was stealing my mobs... He said that I needed to get better at tagging.. Lol.. Needless to say, he left after he notice I was just following him around fearing his mobs making his grind twice as long xD
---
Well, this is how it is and it's regular. I know you had different expectations, but reality won't meet them.   
---
And I didn't see any messages from Blizzard asking me to play retail :D
---
It’s by far the most powerful talent in the resto tree. How can you, as a healer, not se the value in an instant cast 5k heal. If I were your class leader I wouldn’t let you in the raid with that spec. You mentioned that you have never used it. I’d suggest you give it a try and you will see the value immediately. You’ve undoubtedly wiped in situations where you didn’t have to as a result of not having the best talent a resto Druid has.
---
Id just go buy manna biscuits if im paying more than 1g for 6 stacks.
---
Lmaooooo man you seem like such a loser!
---
Yes plz fade away to nothing just like my post did
---
Oh, lol I feel like an idiot
---
What’s gonna be even worse is when bg ques for horde go past 30 min because a lot of casual alliance get the rep rewards and don’t like turtle AVs anymore.
---
Me neither, I was just curious if I could recreate that when I saw the picture of it here or on forums during que times to log in.  
---
Might be actually fun to level an alt with "point-to-click move" in settings and camera angle.
---
I wanna play a paladin, but can’t bring myself to play with gnomes.
---
I have no idea what to think of his toolbar.  He's raiding as Arms, but he has Slam on his tool bar *3 times*, but only one of the keys is bound and it's with a worse placed keybind than Heroic Strike
---
???
---
&gt; So by being quiet and letting it go by without any indication of the impact it had, it will be addressed and handled better next time?
---
no, it won't be handled better next time either way... if you think your negative comments are going to have any affect on Blizzards behavior...
---
&gt;No. That's not how it works. Honestly you're daft if this is the way you think. The world would still have Coloured Only water fountains if your ideology was the common one.
---
Nah, that is a fight worth fighting. Comparing a 4hr downtime in a game to the civil rights movement is disingenuous and an actual affront to ongoing civil rights struggles.
---
&gt;I don't mean to upset you, but here. You are wrong.
---
the only one of us displaying significant emotion through writing is you homie
---
Run the deep prot build that has 2/2 imp OP and you'll rarely lose a 1v1 against another melee class.
---
My favorite thing to do between AV queues is dueling geared Arms warriors. All you have to do is stack them to 5 sunders and OP every time it pops. Once they're at 5 sunders  start using shield slam. Only warriors I lose against are ones either have BRE or are able to avoid a hamstring and sit in my dead zone while they wait for their swing timer.
---
Rogues can sometimes get you if they pop everything.
---
You can even get unprepared mages if you use FAP. Just need to Shield Bash/Conc Blow/AoE fear them when they try to poly you.
---
How many people need to have the aqual quintessence quest done to summon? Is it just 4 to douse the 4 runes?
---
I was running Strat last night with some friends, still trying to get the last piece of bis for my healing set, when an undead rogue and an orc warrior decided to open up on me. Swear to God I held them at the gate to Strat until my entire group ran from LHC to the entrance. Nearly had the rogue dead before they got there purely from my porcupine damage. 
---
I love playing a Paladin.
---
So does hitting harder...
---
Then they have the nerve to release the 1.12 PvP rewards!! It’s insanity. I can’t wait for all the “Classic is easy” guilds to start attempting 40 man Naxx.
---
Finished MC multiple times with base ~40 FR, zero issues.
---
Time is a part of the classic commitment either way. But imagine two groups that both have the requirements of engineering and consumables. able to compete on a equal level where item use since both teams have it would become a part of the skill required to play rated bgs well. Its something that only can happen in classic.
---
6pm EST? Yes...
---
can you link this post? the only one i saw confirmed that it was correct. but i could have missed something.
---
I'm a "code-monkey." I don't make a profit from my company selling the software I develop. But I get a decent salary and I get to help create something. So this is very close to me.
---
Realistically, he was stupid for telling you his plan. Classic Hollywood bad guy mistake. He should have just camped you till you left and shut the Fuck up about it. You would have never known it was him.
---
I think there are two types of retail players left in WoW. Those so invested in the game's transmogs and mounts that they can't help but try to maintain it and those that just want to wipe the new content ASAP then quit.
---
Im kinda wondering if youre being serious here. If so, then damn, that's sad.
---
What is this post, trying to pretend that having to wait 10-15 minutes for a queue is a good thing? If you're on Alliance and you need to do something, you can just....you know....not queue until you're ready?
---
I admit, I downloaded retail again (don't have BfA). Logged on a few of my characters... took a stroll down memory lane for about 5-6 minutes... then logged off and uninstalled.

The literal very first thing I was inundated with was the WoW Store. Fuuuuck that.
---
This is the only answer
---
I do the opposite, play EU while living on the east coast. Pretty consistent 120 ms, and it's fine
---
Some people put a lot more time in than others. Some people are account sharing.
---
Not just about "SKILL" or lack thereof, it's a massive time investment.
---
It's fun when you get good teammates who can react to weird situations with improvisation. We had the alliance spawn new marshalls while we were on Van. Someone yelled for hunters to kite, because we were shorthanded to begin with. There was no off-tanking to be had. Hunters dragged two marshalls out of the room and kited them long enough for the win.
---
I think its 8. One for each boss.
---
&gt;it's another "rant/vent" post mis-tagged as "discussion" episode
---
As someone with the day off, this is fine.  
---
Life does not revolve around wow y'all. If your day is ruined because of server maintenance, there's something wrong with your life that you need to address. Get some fresh air, read a book... I dunno what y'all like to do, but please don't let thoughts of wow downtime dampen your day.
---
&gt; I don't even know what to say anymore.
---
Then why post this whiny bullshit to begin with?
---
I can confirm this happens every game. You often get called out if you want to defend. While the horde recall in great numbers to defend, there are usually only 1-5 Alliance defending. It isn't that we can't fight back, it just isn't optimal.
---
Most of the time the drop tables on wowhead are completely wrong I'd take them with a grain of salt, they can point you in the right direction but many mobs drop much more than wowhead shows or have much much lower drop rates than wowhead shows.
---
I had a thought, but then realized it wouldn't work. I was spoiled by FFXIV and their maintenance always being overnight in the US, because they're based in Japan. Was going to suggest an overnight team but I highly doubt any of them want to do that, and it probably wouldn't help at all if stuff went sideways during the day.
---
Gloves of Restoration.
---
Fire resistance isn't particularly necessary in MC as any ranged character up until Ragnaros. The main benefit is that it gives you an RNG chance of not getting one shot by fire blossum during trash pulls. But the 10 FR is not worth the loss of intellect and healing power.
---
Thank god someone with more than 2 conflicting brain cells gets it. Thank you my friend!
---
Honestly I think it's funny to play with Gnomes. It makes me laugh when they wreck Horde in BG. I would never play one, but I must say their racials are OP.
---
Psh. Imagine needing science to do what I can do with my wand. Wizard from Atlantis here btw
---
&gt; I cant tell if this is a troll post.
---
No, it's just garden-variety idiocy.
---
Lmao imagine wanting people to be banned for playing the game
---
chris is the least hot, ill tell ya that
---
WAHHHH DONT GRIEF ME WAHHH
---
Thanks! This seems very good path to go, atleast to me. Also both profesions are new to me so more content to get into.
---
lol relax there, sir. misunderstanding.
---
So give it to someone who can get the hand of rag immediately, or wait for the drama-causing-idiot who will have to still craft the hammer (which can take a very... long... time....)....
---
Simple choice. Boot the drama queen, keep the hand of rag wielding paladin.
---
A lot of people really don't understand how the honor system works, no matter how many times you explain it to them. I have guildies that are pulling their hair out over having to wait for their honor, biting their nails as "all the other Horde players are getting honor while I sit here doing nothing."
---
&gt;They also do not contribute anything positive to a sub.
---
in your (wrong) opinion
---
And you're apparently incapable of logical argument. 
---
Have a good day.
---
i did this when i had to subscribe for the stress tests last summer, was fun looking at my gear but the rest of the game looked so alien
---
I did say it was a meme build, so it’s kinda expected it’s very niche and only good at doing 1 thing, which is kiting.
---
Idk what is this long reply for, I don’t sport the build either. Obviously I use the aimedshot build, it’s better in almost every way.
---
Anyway the problem with a 3s channel is not the damage, I use aimed all the time in AV cause it’s easy to be in a safe position. The problem is 3s in small fights, like is wsg is that even healers are smart enough to walk near you in 3s.
---
That sounds tasty af.
---
If you precast a pyro and follow it with a pom pyro and a few instant casts then 6k is quite easy

What a stupid question

Couple questions for my new 60 hunter alt. I am gearing up my new lvl 60 hunter, got some good pieces like devil set, av ring, tribute ring, some beast stalkers, ect ect..... 
---
1) My first gearing question, is barb blade really that much better than warmonger, I feel like I can use the 3 percent hit on the warmonger to my advantage for hit capping and swapping out other gear pieces? 
---
2) I use dwarven hand cannon as my weapon but a lot of people say the ud strat crossbow or av rep xbow are significantly better? I don't see it. Please tell me whats truly BIS item besides Rhok or other MC epics. 
---
3) How does attack power truly work for a hunter is it completely useless or do pets benefit from it? 
---
4) Any good guide on macros for my pets functions like recalling pet, dismissing idk just something to help make things easier if I attempt DM or something crazy in the future? 
---
5) Best farm runs for herbalism hunter besides mara or dm? 
---
Thank you for any help.

Well, I take that back. I literally typed. I don't remember if I spoke it aloud.
---
It's not in Arial and ye, it is the one thing I havnt changed yet cause MORPHEUS controls like 2 areas of text (quest log headers and mail-text, and who the fuck reads the mail?).
---
And please, opinions are and forever will be opinions. I imagine your UI looking like a total hellhole from my perspective, doesnt change anything really. You stupid for trying to argue about personal preferences, that's like saying a gaming-nerd that only plays CSGO and DOTA is not an actual gaming-nerd because you yourself only enjoy SC:BW and WOW.
---
Well fuck me back to brd.
---
NPC's were a lot harder previously, so you couldn't just zerg down marshals.
---
That's the best term for it, I think. It's like "hmm, this clone of World of Warcraft looks off somehow..."
---
according to wowprog, there's 720 X 20 people who killed M azshara, worldwide.
---
even being really pessismitic with 1'000'000 active retail player, that's 0,015% of the playerbase... 5 months after release? You're right. 0,5% is incorrect.. it's much lower than that.
---
now, I'd argue than if you don't complete the mythic raid, you haven't completed the mythic difficulty... but you could point out the first boss is (usually) a loot pinata... so let's go for the mid-tier wall (orgozoa kill in this case):
---
according to wowprog,  there's 4000 kill on orgozoa, 20 raider per, so 0,08% of the population.
---
... long story short,  yes, mythic difficulty is tuned for a ridiculously small % of the playerbase.
---
Yea, that was exactly my point. I’ve tried personally just to avoid the 9/10 posts with whining etc and stick to the decent content.
---
Great idea, I'll put that on my list of things to do.
---
They did at the end of vanilla, and they will probably do so again if we progress into TBC.
---
Players like this make everyones game a little more fun.
---
No, an 8 hour down time is not regular, and is not how it is. 8 hour classic downtime compared to 1 hour retail downtime seems a little off no?
---
What happens if I log out in a dungeon while soloing? Will I be ported to the entrance or my hearthstone location after a certain period of time?
---
So why do you have to add “family, a career, and a mortgage” in your title? Your age alone would’ve sufficed. Sounds like you wanted to humblebrag for whatever reason.
---
Any premade wanting to grind honor, goes for 7 minute victories. Farming GY slows down honor/hr.
---
Most of my WoW time has been Horde (except for vanilla) but I'm so glad to be playing Alliance again because I get so sick of the shady (basically evil) quests associated with the Forsaken and all the main Horde locations being spikey mud huts or a glorified grave
---
Wow that's amazing story man thanks so much for sharing!
---
there is an ads phase?
---
I DIDNT WANT TO CHANGE MY OIL MYSELF AND GO TO THE GYM! WHY IS THAT SO HARD TO GET!? I WANTED TO BE LAZY ARRGRGGGRGRGHH
---
Lol all jokes aside, I'm killing my errand list atm. Just wanted to vent because I woke up early today to get some playtime in! (ok, my girlfriend woke me up early cuz they cant let you sleep in on your day off :-p)
---
“modern problems require modern solutions”
---
&gt;I'm beginning to think you guys LIKE endless no-skill grinding
---
You just described like 95% of Classic WoW, so I would say anyone who seriously plays Classic WoW either likes or has a very high tolerance for monotonous grinds.
---
You do seem exactly like the type of person who loves wasting everyone's time. Very mature and collected. Cheers.
---
No idea on the downvotes just saw this reply right now.
---
Says the man abandoning argument for insult.
---
Take care.
---
Just to explain, I stopped grinding for it, I didn't get it. Never even saw Gorosh
---
The fastest way I can think to get to WS as an Alliance is either taking a port to Darn and flying or flying to BB, then flying out of Rachet. Yeah, that sounds like a task... I am currently leveling blacksmithing, I am not looking forward to the ore grind ahead of me. But hey, it's about the adventure, right.... lol
---
What happened to WvW?
---
in many cases, maintenance downtimes have nothing to do with hardware.
---
Just set it to masterlooter
---
Am I wrong thinking the rewards for this are just mediocre for the time actually spent? Aren't Naxx and AQ 40 items more powerful in PVP? He'll even BWL. Coming from a mage perspective.
---
pot meet kettle.
---
Meanwhile the rogue is sitting there trying to get his 3 more kills for a quest.
---
I forgot he even *had* adds. We just burned through Rag from our first raid onwards. What are your DPS doing exactly..?
---
Last night it said 7-8 or 8-9 whatever the regular downtime is.
---
Your goal should be to burn him before that phase, 3 minute timer. Range should go hard the second tank pulls, full balls to the wall DPS.
---
What is LiP?
---
Yup I was friends with the first 14 on my server in vanilla.  He was on 24/7 in a premise guiid group and they farmed bgs (and won every single one) in order to get to 14.  Even with that he was stuck at 13 for a few weeks
---
Woops Garrosh
---
But mom said there are no stupid questions uwu
---
problem with alt for alch (which is actually what i did) is that you can't realistically get the major mana pot recipe ( to turn dreamfoil into major mana potions) unless you get to 60, because it drops off the last boss in scholo
---
Don't  play semantics.
---
and I did speak with my wallet, I unsubscribed.
---
I really think we will see a serious correction to the mean the week after new years. You wont have to half a million honor necessary to stop decay at rank 7 crap.
---
lmaooo was wondering what you were on about. Made a /r/HongKong  cringe post sayin hes about to boycott blizzard and here he is, fully aware of the tuesday reset being 8 hours. LOL. thank you
---
Thank you! I mean, I still playing TBC and had fun, but I was disappointed with it from the get go. The devs seemed to take the easy way out and instead of incorporating new stuff in among the old, it was easier to essentially just abandon it all and pretty much treat TBC as a sequel instead of an expansion.
---
Hyjal was in as a Caverns of Time thing, but the zone itself wasn't open. I don't know when that opened, as I quit during TBC.
---
I've had people get REALLY salty over me aoe farming near them to the point where they have sent me death threats. I'm literally just chilling here leveling and minding my own business. I don't know what it is about aoe farming that pisses people off so much. Sure, perhaps they need the same mobs for questing, but there are plenty to go around, and it's honestly more efficient for everyone when you're not sharing the loot or exp.
---
Damn 0 eyes?
---
We just got our last one for our priests two weeks ago, and none of our hunters need the leafs.
---
The only 8 minute AV I’ve gotten the past few days was today.. Horde went full zerg cause server shutdown was in 11 mins 
---
Past that it’s been 30m losses
---
Sometimes it's just a reboot.
---
Okay get this... collect your brain cells for a moment.... has classic been down for 8 hours every Tuesday for 15 years? Yeah didn’t think so.
---
WSG queues can take a bit. I made it out of the war room in IF before the queue popped.
---
I’m always surprised when people don’t read the full post or comprehend the in your face obvious thing that people are posting and complaining about. Then comment and make jokes thinking they are so smart and funny but look like fucking idiots because it’s not the thing people are actually complaining about...
---
I messed around and got my shaman completely geared from mc/ony bc there is only 2 raiding shaman in my guild and shit just keeps dropping. That kind of made my mind up for me. RIP my 60 hunter and 54 rogue and 36 warrior and 28 warlock and 21 mage and... nvm no I haven't decided
---
The cap is 315 I believe. So probably 250ish with gear would be ideal
---
Dude, thank you. I always forget to check ALL of their community outlets for things like this and you reminded me I should. But thats not to say I wasn't expecting downtime, as I do every Tuesday, I just didnt think another 8 hour block. But yea I gotta be up on their twitter for the updates.
---
Yeah, damn.
---
Imagine being a blizzard dev asked to step out of Retail for Classic because many of your design choices were mistakes and there is actually more demand for the OG game than your baby.
---
Being asked to work night shifts in addition would be salt in the wound.
---
Ok Freud.
---
&gt;When I prove you wrong will you record a video of yourself saying that you are not worthy and I am your overlord in WoW?
---
No, but if you do prove to me that sunder armor is more threat than negating both miss chances and glancing blows, I will of course admit that you were right.

---
bleach stacks, can't wrap it
---
And missed one of the best, if not THE best expansions... good for you lol
---
Because maybe 10% of the people who went into AV the first few days alot are there for honor?
---
The rest are there for rep. My assumption is that in 3 days the vast majority of alliance stopped playing AV. In about 2 weeks the majority of Horde will have stopped. This is when the queues will go down again. In the meantime, a lot of horde will br going WSG to farm honor, because 20-30 minute wait + 20 minute game for 4-5k honor is not worth it.
---
Wait how many ret pallies do you have?  
---
Bless your hearts...
---
If all they wanted to do today was to stay at home all day and play wow then yes their day is ruined. There doesn't have to anything wrong with their life. If you planned to take your kids to the zoo, but then it rained for 8 hours, I'm sure their day would be ruined as well.
---
Dude that's sweet
---
.. Like I am not claiming to know blizzards maintenance process, but I VERY MUCH DOUBT the time is technologically limited and likely never was (though 2005 was a different time) 
---
They're not watching an 8 hour loading bar, it's 8 hours for a team to do a list of tasks, likely one that takes far less than 8 hours but with plenty of wiggle room.
---
You could make the processing power infinite, it still takes time for people to check lists, talk to their team leads, validate that the needful was done, etc.
---
Servers are down for maintenance for about another 6 hours, at least NA-side.
---
Yep. As someone who played in vanilla, these titles never meant anything to anyone, because they were not challenging to obtain. Literally just do x more, don't even have to be good or bad at it, JUST DO IT, and eventually, get title.
---
Don't know why anyone thinks PVP titling has anything to do with prestige.
---
Lightspeed engine mechanic here, slow day at the office
---
WTF you talking about contracts and shit?
---
In the 8 hours classic might be down, I couldn't find enough time to break apart the complete disaster of an argument you just tried to make
---
Also, i'm not sure, the math does seem kinda hard, maybe itll go over your head but i'm fairly certain 64% upvoted means MORE people at least SOMEWHAT agree with my venting than those that downvoted me (\~36%)
---
Just want to make it more obvious because I have a weird suspicion you're confused.... 64 &gt; 36...
---
It would be really great if Blizzard would open up multiple regions to a single account so both would be an option. It is closed to make less gold spammers? I don't know what the other benefits are for making that restriction.
---
Seriously though, with so many abilities how do you not click??   
---
I pretty much click everything except charge.
---
It is not considered an act of grief. I am helping my fellow mage be more efficient by assisting him in gathering targets to aoe.
---
Time for the weekly shower
---
“Nothing” huh? Do elaborate. Then please explain your solution for a competitive pvp environment.
---
It really doesn’t
---
The negativity is only on this sub and the forums. Log onto the game and you’ll see it’s actually a really fun time!
---
lol, shes a druid and I'm a rogue. Believe it or not, gf's that play WoW exist :)
---
That's good to hear you're killing it! And sorry to be so pushy with my mentality, everyone has a different life and I shouldn't project my own virtues into others agency.
---
Is corpse camping FPs then also greifing?
---
Am filthy casual dad that barely made it to 60 and dont even know my bis list. Asume mail is for hunters, plate is for warriors. Of course i roll, no shame about it.
---
No, usually it's an hour or so.
---
No changes mate. Long maintainence was part of early WoW.
---
I find it more annoying when the tanks are constantly taunting off each other and none of them can build any threat. It's like they make it harder on themselves.
---
Do you have problems with raids or AV?
---
They are using all their portal reagents to trick people into leaving AV.
---
Bird law. Check mate.
---
Tips for dps, no meme specs and should be fine. Other wise going to have to deal with add phase if it's super casual.
---
They are talking about how the client forced a patch download and now the server screen says incompatible.
---
WotLK was pretty solid.
---
BGs were added only a few days earlier than in vanilla. Idk why people keep saying this as if BGs came out extraordinarily early or something in classic.
---
yes but in EU they are on wednesday 3 am so in 9h
---
more like disarming the murderer. Yeah it's the people who suck, but now they can use fewer tools to annoy you.
---
"Don't blame Blizzard for the players behavior!!!!"
---
*Blizzard quietly chucking 1.5 AV into the trash bin*
---
but it's the most ideal time because most people are employed and working normal hours. Why would they inconvenience the majority?
---
Okay. That’s on me. I set the bar too low.
---
I’ll get downvoted, but he’s right. You should have made it clear who the eye was going to. I’d be pissed too if I was doing more dps and got skipped over. Who cares the other dude farmed the hammer? He only did that out of self interest so he could have a reason to claim the eye.
---
Same here.
---
Would be thankful for help
---
Bump
---
Sorry this is a very serious video game
---
Rofl as i said there likely wont be any any changes therefore the 12 of you left after a year can have fun trying to make groups for literally anything.
---
eh, it almost worked. I logged into retail... had all kinds of pop up alerts to go do this or that. I just alt+f4'ed. 
---
Everything is just a time or gold sink.
---
Ye going and make someone guildless over such a thing is petty indeed.
---
I think that's justified. Not all SM/Ruin locks take 5/5 suppression, but if they do it certainly helps in applying curses. You could also give the SM/Ruin locks prio on corruption slots due to nightfall (and suppression and grim reach). That said, are there any DS/Ruin locks left? It sims a tiny amount of more dps, that's right, but the affliction talents are so much better to do anything outside raids (farming, pvp,..).
---
Boomers fighting in the middle screaming ‘for teh hoerd/anlimance!!’

Oh man, the first day everyone joined the best fucking servers. We joined the worst and took that shit to the number 1 spot, watched all the noobs flood in wanting an easy win and we then  transferred to the worst again.
---
Good times. We locked EU wvw down
---
Dude, im just bullshitting and bantering with strangers on the internet. Be happier in life my guy, itll get better, I promise.
---
Most players don’t play 20+ hours a week.
---
During p2 I felt so bad for the alliance. Any time they would muster up a good PvP squad, horde would zerg in and just shit all over there groups. I think now that BG are out a lot of raid loggers ha e came back so it's probably back to closer 60/40 split.
---
Thank you.
---
The "get a job/life" posts are so stupidly condescending.
---
A lot of the time people get frustrated specifically because their life is so busy and on the day they happened to have a lot of time to play, Blizzard extends maintenance to 8 hours.
---
It's totally reasonable to be upset.
---
smh letting your gf play WoW was the first mistake I would never 
---
too many horny orcs
---
What do you suggest?
---
Well a few days ago Blizzard’s twitter said it would be a one hour maintenance so maybe people made plans based on that?
---
While also arbitairly changing devilsaur spawns. The entire situation is very frustrating.
---
Filthy casual dad here. I may have time to farm brd arena for 1 hour, but I will not have time for MC or a serious raiding schedule.
---
People "unable to tolerate the existence of non-Englis speakers"? Get over yourself, clown. Most of the people in this thread are clearly joking. Ultimately, that's what a lot of interaction with Chinese game players has been in the West. They sell gold. They create and sell bots and Chinese censorship is a real thing. If your first thought reading through this thread was to accuse people here of some form of ignorance and racism, you need to re-evaluate your life. This is an English speaking website on an English speaking sub.
---
Yeah that makes sense, I remember it going down at 7pm my time usually and it was a right pain.  
---
Totally forgot about the odd midnight maintenance, my bad.
---
The most annoying part of the week.
---
You know, that's an interesting sentiment... I wonder how many people out the real world are like IRL min/maxers? There's gotta be something to this...
---
Odd, I just updated my Bnet client, and got an error when I went to launch the game... So looks like someone screwed up.

Im not sure why this would be the case when Mace spec was the only thing anyone ever went in TBC (and beyond) for arena and BGs. The mace stun is just too godly

Seems like sometimes you can't get a straight answer on here. Yeah, both are griefing, but retaliatory can be seen as justified; fighting fire with fire.

Yeah dude, I work nights and don't really get to log much on weekends so this has been pissing me off as well. More time to play Halo Reach i guess, because there's no way I'm reinstalling retail lol.
---
Yeah dumb post tbh. It was a weird way of justifying the Horde still has it better. 10 minute queue isn't going to let you go wPvP against nonexistent ally who are all in BGs. 10min queue has always been the norm for BG queues during my 15 years playing this game. I don't really think anyone is actually complaining about it either?
---
Didn't you hear? This game all about honor grinding and not about actually enjoying the actual PvP aspect of the game.
---
Honestly it's just super common with MMO fan bases in general. They think any criticism of the game/devs is a personal attack against themselves since they put so much time into the game.
---
Watch your profamity
---
Ah, then they must have changed it to be a list. Back when I saw it in the TOS it was just a blanket you cannot name your character after a pre-existing npc. I had a character get force name changed a long time ago and I just happened to notice the rule when looking through the naming part of the TOS.
---
People are giant pussies
---
I mean that's what you would say sure. I also tell the Police I wasn't speeding and I was just matching traffic. I still get a ticket.
---
When it dropped for my guild we said: Who is gonna make this thing with no guild funding whatsoever. One warrior said he would farm however long it took. So we gave it to him and a week later the item was finished. If someone crafted the damn thing already its got to go to him.
---
Re-read what I said. I never said most players play 20hrs a week. I just said that those who do are going to have a high % that are already exalted.
---
you know you're dealing with a true casual with words like 
---
&gt; Then he left and went to **the scarlet monastery dungeon**
---
Except me, at work
---
Rank 14s were a big deal back in Vanilla.   At least the early wave of them.   The later waves, not so much.
---
I bought the game, saw what everyone *wasn’t* playing, and made it work.
---
That was the plan all along.... I'm sure.
---
I think it is just the quest which starts in eastern plaguelands
---
Because sword spec gices u rage, its aignificantly stronger for classic pvp. Mace spec cc is decent but that rage generation is just too powerful
---
You only get rep for a heroic kill if you were close enough to earn honor for that heroic kill.  Turn-ins give rep globally.  If someone kills somebody where you can't see them, you will not get rep for that kill.
---
Servers are still down, no one can get on.
---
His poor chair!
---
Who pays for porn? wtf
---
The great thing is since this is Vanilla and there is no resist gear, we can have fun raiding for gear that is awesome and pvp viable!
---
Leave battleground is right
---
We've been doing Geddon with me at around 200 FR; only pieces i have right now for resist are Gyth's Skull of FR, Drakefire Amulet, Dark Iron Shoulders and Plate, Wildfire Cape and a FR ring. I've been stepping away from his fire pulse waves, too much damage with my gear.
---
Is defense really irrelevant? Geddon has punched and crit me for 3500 before.
---
So what I take from this is aiming for 250ish FR from gear and then fill the remaining gear slots with threat pieces, right?
---
They have always known that
---
and then everyone clapped
---
yea my friend logged out to put a new add on and now cant log back in while im still playing.

I mentioned nothing about vanilla, BC, or wrath. I’m talking about classic WoW. The bare bones game they already had down pat 15 years ago. Saying “oh well the patches took them 8 hours 15 years ago so obviously they are gonna take the same amount of time now after 15 years of growth as a company” sounds a bit foolish no?
---
&gt; What do?
---
Wait for servers to come back up
---
My friend is ingame.
---
I’ve never had it take 10 tries with up to 6 players.
---
Usually about the same I think. I’ll double check tonight for raid but I don’t usually have any problems and I am off tank/main tank sometimes.
---
Full [battle.net](https://battle.net) client restart helps.
---
Man, I wish the internet was full of more people like you. 
---
I hope you have a great day and may Azeroth shower you with epics when THE FUCKIN SERVERS COME BAKC ONLINE FINALLY UGGHGHGHGH
---
It's the vocal minority.  Longest game I saw all week was 38m and that's only because Horde capped SH gy immediately and it wasn't a loss because our D wiped the Alliance zerg.
---
Yes the only douche was the mage who tried clear you out of his “spot”. Not the guy who revenge chased him across a continent.
---
/r/thathappened
---
Everyone clapped and had 2 accounts.
---
raid geared 60s beating up on 50s, yea amazing ganks!
---
Why do twitch thots have patreons that people pay 100/month for snapchat and other pics?
---
The people paying for that are paying for porn
---
What did you understand from my comment, specifically?
---
I've heard the timer is 4.5 minutes - but what will happen is you'll be at the start of a new instance, unless you're at the instance cap, in which case you'll be hearthed
---
Is this the TPB episode where Bubbles tries to punch that boxing star in the nuts twice for a thousand euros?
---
I got into the last room and died stupidly to dogs while trying to kill them.  that was the first and only time I got past all the trash.  My biggest problem is that I do 3 or 4 attempts on the run in, and then get frustrated and go do something else.  I understand that all I need to do is set aside a few hours to put the hammer down and get it done, just haven't brought myself to do that yet.  
---
The boss is kill is easy to execute you say?
---
Had the issue aswell, restarted battlenet, and within the duration of me checking reddit it magically fixed itself :)
---
$1.73/hr since there are 52 weeks a year it comes out to 8.67 hours a month. This does not account for sales tax depending on state.
---
but my pally trainer gave me a charger at 15% interest with 300g down payment
---
This is incredible.
---
As a guild leader, we appreciate people letting us know about stuff like this. If we don’t know about it we can’t address it, and the guild reputation suffers.
---
If the ninja was my guildie, I’d take your info and then have a chat with them about it, and if they’re remorseful it’s a one time final warning, if not remorseful it’s a gkick. And I’d follow up with you after to let you know how it went.
---
I think it's there from the beggining didn't play too much to be 100% sure
---
Nothing it’s a staged video
---
Yes! I hopped so many classes over the years and never really landed on any thing but this time I tried a Shaman and he is fucking awesome. Incidentally I do have an alt that is a warlock lvl 14. I deleted my druid at level like 30 ish? or mid 20s? because I didnt want him to distract me from my shaman,  
---
Shaman is awesome.
---
Oh yeah, absolutely expected. I remember having a strategy for Ragnaros's sons during phase 2. Turns out it's just easier to not do phase 2 and just kill him in one. That wasn't a think (or it was rare if it was.) I've also heard that the T1 gear that is dropping in MC is buffed compared to what it was in actual vanilla, I don't know the details though, just something I heard.
---
Lol at all the idiots in the replies posting screenshot of YESTERDAYS maintenance schedule trying to call blizzard out for changing the hours last minute. Must have been AV grinding so long they lost track of the date.
---
Ehhh, so i reached rank 10 in vanilla, champion.  I rocked that title or the conqueror title well through wrath.  Because they were some of the first titles they always felt special to me.  My guild really formed throguh wsg premades, so maybe my experience was unique.
---
Try to login now or restart your [battle.net](https://battle.net) client if you still cannot login: it helps.
---
Bro
---
You're a dumbass
---
They said it.
---
It's their chance of survival.
---
I'm going to get flamed so hard for this, but deep down you know it's true:
---
Legit RBG R14 is more impressive than legit Vanilla/Classic R14.
---
1. Barb blade is really good. +1% crit and 60 AP is a lot. Warmonger if you're really need the hit.
---
2. Xbox is way better. It can perform rotations without clipping auto shots. 
---
3. AP adds flat damage. Pets don't gain anything from gear except from set bonuses. 
---
4. I use scroll wheel up/down for attack and follow commands. Mouse 4 for passive and Mouse 3 for stay. You only really need the passive and stay if you planning on doing solo tribute runs. 
---
I highly recommend getting engineering and learning how to do solo tribute runs. 
---
Also you get 4 pre-bis items in Dire Maul North. Weapon, 2 rings and chest piece. Helm and belt in Dire Maul West.
---
You and multiple hundreds of people did the same this week - you'll likely fall in the middle of the pack and wind up Rank 2.
---
I think when you hit 60 and have nearly full MC gear --- thats kinda your main lolol
---
See, and that's something I didn't know, and I like that. On Horde, I knew the best way to anywhere. Now that I am on the Alliance, it's like a new game.
---
I must have fallen for some bait here.
---
So what you're saying is, that you are a no life nerd who grinds wow all day long, doesn't get laid, barely takes a shower, and goes out to be social and active with friends and family, don't go to christmas parties or even celebrate christmas or does new years eve, right on buddy, surely something to be proud of ;-)  
---
It's not because you have it, because with this current meta you don't got shit except endless hours wasted in AV all day long, for pixels..........
---
You sir are the definition of TOP KEK.
---
NOOOO DONT FALL FOR IT! UNINSTALL!!!!!
---
I'm waiting too :D
---
I have this week off and my only goal was to level in classic. I've done all my real life shit so I could play this week. I'm not bitching about the maintenance, I'd much rather play a game that is working as intended than one that's broken. 
---
telling people to go do productive real life things is bullshit, some people legit only have this time to play and that's an understandable frustration. Some people like me planned this week out and this affects that. That being said blizzard also have a decent amount of notice to allow people's plans to change based of the maintenance times(noone should have been caught off guard by logging in and seeing 8 hours, it was posted to the blizzard launcher and Twitter yesterday.
---
&gt; It’s by far the most powerful talent in the resto tree 
---
No, it's not.  As i said before, very situational.  Yes, it's helpful, and yes, it could save from a wipe.  I just can't justify spending a point on a talent that I'll maybe use once or twice in a raid...especially in my raid group, where we are healer heavy.
---
&gt; If I were your class leader I wouldn’t let you in the raid with that spec. 
---
Since we don't have Armory, this is how that conversation would go.
---
You:  Do you have that talent
---
Me:  Well of course I do. (wink,wink)
---
&gt;  You mentioned that you have never used it. I’d suggest you give it a try and you will see the value immediately. 
---
As soon as Blizzard drastically reduces the cost of re-spec'ing....I might.
---
&gt; You’ve undoubtedly wiped in situations where you didn’t have to as a result of not having the best talent a resto Druid has. 
---
Nope, we haven't.  As I said, my raid team is a little healer heavy.  Maybe if we weren't healer heavy, I'd give it a shot, but until then, I'm enjoying my spot in the top 5 healers in my raid team.
---
No its not
---
They won’t you still keep them.
---
for mobs 3 levels higher you need 16%
---
I’ve recently done the same thing and it was well worth it. You’re right, its really like a new game. I had to make the long journey from Stormwind to Hillsbrad for the first time for my Whirlwind Axe quest and it was a memorable experience for sure! I definitely enjoyed running Deadmines vs. Wailing Caverns as well. Opening up a whole new perspective on the World.... of Warcraft
---
The butthurt is stronk
---
I’m just sad bc I only want rank 10, but all the people going for 14 will make that nearly impossible for me
---
I love every minute of it. This is the wow I want to play, not that bullshit on retail. If classic didn't exist, I'd never play wow again.
---
 It's not about nostalgia, it's the mechanics and the environment that I enjoy.
---
🤣
---
It's just a game, and not very serious, but I'm sure you of all people would understand that, as a fellow adult with full time responsibilities, a family, and a losing NFL team to watch on Sundays - I really like my in game time to be efficient and enjoyable.
---
When another individual, who clearly doesn't have anything else to do, spends their time in attempt to kill members of their own faction, camping Reddit posts to make pointless comments and huehuehue's, and trolling on the net - then decides to ruin my free time? You want to swap to your ally and PK me, by all means, enjoy. Choosing to make bad XP for not only me, but yourself too.. like, why?
---
Anyway, like I said - I'm sure you get it, being a sensible adult. 
---
Enjoy your Holidays.
---
Literally dozens of them!
---
That would explain how random it is! It's unsettling to see when you're roamin around out there alone haha
---
Everyone is different, but i get your point
---
My main is a 55 Hunter and my main alt is a 25 Warlock.
---
I gave up on my 24 Preist, 22 rogue, and 17 Druid because the rested XP was too much to keep up with.
---
Ok, you clearly have no idea what you're talking about. [Google is your friend](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Shaman_(lore))
---
So...did you win?
---
Seriously do this
---
worth doing once, only to get Triprunner's
---
Imagine hating on old people.
---
It was changed yesterday at least. I made a comment about it to my guild. It was also posted to twitter last night.
---

When you extract each fragment, the two banshees spawn
---
Classic is run by a skeleton crew already.
---
Half of those are probably on vacation.
---
The half stuck working on the update probably don't have much of an idea what the hell they're doing.
---
All this could be resolved if Activision stood up to their stock holders and said "We need to hire more people for Classic" but that'll never happen. The goal is to milk WoW as long as possible with a little staff as possible, to maximize profits for the stock holders so they can buy more coke/boats/hookers.
---
It 100% is, cross collaboration is a suspendable offense.
---
Something doesn’t add up here...
---
I have a guildie that doesn’t sleep. I log off around 10 pm, he’s in AV. I log on for a bit around 6:30 am before work to check mail/post on AH, he’s in AV and has been in AV all night. He works a few hours during the day then repeats. Since AV released.
---
AP applies to both and RAP applies to ranged only. Note that world buff AP doesn’t apply to ranged for some reason.
---
in an idea world, yes.  But in reality some warlocks are just going to be better than others when it comes to damage, and some warlocks are going to be better  than others at curse uptime.
---
I had hoped this was because the paid transfer for a sec.
---
They will never because “you really dont want classic” 🤣
---
holy shit ahahahahahahahahahahaa
---
--cries in 100+ Yogg Saron runs--
---
...when else are you supposed to use it?
---
ESH
---
that was just last night
---
yeah i feel that, this shit is annoying, servers would be back in the morning time but now with BGs we have to wait even longer. SICK I use to look foward to server maintenance but now this BLOWS
---
Dude how has that game been? I was playing a while back and it was actually a breath of fresh air compared to the shit show of a card game it can be at times when you're not really keen on everything and mechanics and rules and have to stop just to look up whether you can cast a sorcery at a certain time lol. But the arena game makes everything so smooth and you can learn a lot more of the rules and shit by following how the game plays. Was thinking of getting back in.
---
That's just being petty mate. Thanks for showing your true color.
---
it's the other way around. there is too much of wow in diablo. fuck off
---
What other content is horde lacking that Alliance has? I've never really heard of this before.
---
Don’t recommend tank warrior. Good for finding a 5 man, bad for finding a raid spot
---
The benefit is you don’t have to look at a gnome everytime you play
---
You know this wasn’t on the launcher yesterday? And I don’t use twitter so how would I have known to plan that I won’t be able to play the game I pay monthly for for more than half of my goddamned day off.
---
If someone wants to enjoy their favorite game, that they pay a monthly subscription to, and all the sudden they can’t and had little warning, it’s gonna make them sad
---
Get off your high horse
---
dunno if youve tried shaman yet - but I was in the exact same boat as you with the druid until I hit like mid twenties and I just didnt like that I couldnt hit very hard and that my weapon upgrades didnt really matter all that much at the end of the day.
---
Shaman is where I landed. ENH till 40 is super fucking fun esp with windfury. At 40 I swapped to ele as recommended by general consensus -- so much fun. Chain lightning hits super hard and you can pump out a lot of burst dmg. With the 30/0/20 with last point going in either 30 or 20 you can heal and all that jazz as well. NAtures swiftness is better for healing but elemental mastery is super fun too.
---
Ive never settled on a class in wow until I tried a shaman.
---
Hi, /u/Naytham
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ebywzo/is_classic_playable_for_alliance_on_sulfuras/). 
---
Is this your opinion or fact?
---
My original question was to ascertain the actual rule, that's all. You offered an "excuse" that would fly with 0 GMs. That story isn't going to do anything.
---
If it ISN'T against the rules, then you don't need a story to begin with.. ?
---
See why I am confused?
---
I played alliance in vanilla and when I got into raiding in BC and wrath I switched to horde. I leveled my lock up on horde in classic but I wanted that 15 years ago feel so I made an alliance character and I love it! Never enjoyed the game so much.
---
TBH the exact strategy doesn't really matter (Galv vs. Drek vs. Defend vs. Whatever). There are exactly TWO reasons that cause Alliance to lose, and I don't know what the solution is as it keeps happening despite the BG being out for a week. 
---
1) Not enough healers south. There isn't anything you can do about this really. Just luck of the draw.
---
2) The big one: People pulling warmasters who aren't a tank. The solution to this is to spam the shit out of chat telling people to NOT even go past the stairs to Drek's room, as Horde are smart and try to fear/mind control/etc people into the room to cause a wipe. This include people being stupid and chasing down Horde into the room and pulling all warmasters. If this happens, and Alliance do not control FWGY/FWRH, they will lose 100% of the time. 
---
Nothing the Horde does really matters, as Alliance have an advantage in AV. If either of #1 or #2 happens, Alliance lose. Period. If they don't, Alliance wins. Period.
---
This sub is just mostly complaining so it seems a lot worse than it actually is.  But i also play on one of the smaller servers so there i dont deal with the over population issues.
---
mount is boe.
---
Sacking the VW is also great for soloing dm and Mara.  Definitely takes the edge off.
---
I think it’s cool that both of you had 2 accounts and both made Horde and Alliance characters on the same realm.
---
Problem now is you are also having to 'compete' with a whole bunch of afk / semi-afk bots/people who are getting easy honor.
---
I can relate. AV is fun as a tank.
---
lol remember that feel as a kid pretending to be sick to stay home from school and then realizing it was maintenance day fkkk
---
Hope you don’t take this the wrong way but if you looked at up someone who was rank 14 as someone who was awesome or great at the game that is more a reflection of your own ignorance on how rank 14 was achieved.
---
I can understand the sentiment but I was 11 and it was a hand-me-down that was the best I was going to get at the time. My mom's desktop could run it well enough but she liked to use it more than never.
---
CCing someone for 50% of the time is usually not enough. You need to be doing 100-&gt;0s with dagger build. What you have to do is cheap shot &gt; sinister &gt; gouge (can insert gnomish death ray here) &gt; kidney &gt; backstab &gt; blind &gt; restealth and sap &gt; wait till the end of sap (stun diminishing will disappear) -&gt; repeat everything above, but this time without gouge (this scheme doesn't work for all classes). Of course, all of this falls apart if they have trinket or resist your stun, then you need to adapt based on your circumstances, but if you let, for example warlock, out of stun - you lost the fight (unless you instantly use shadow reflector, but still its dicey).
---
Bet you use ice block when you’re surrounded and about to die too.. hehe
---
wait there is a winterspring mount?
---
wonder what they did...
---
Yeah but how does it work? Is it just the two accounts thing?
---
many people have multiple accounts
---
Some people to spend money
---
No. We agreed.
---
My question is: **Did you have fun playing?**
---
11 Hours of AV to grind revered-to-exalted sounds like a blast!  If you did it in 4-5 2-3 hour sessions, it sounds like a piece of cake and if you Love AV, it sounds like nothing.
---
But...do you like it?  Was it a true grind i.e. did you want to claw your own eyes out most of the time?
---
Insert “first time meme pic”
---
Yes but that’s the point. With 40 random people, SOMEONE will always click need. 
---
So you have two options, roll greed like a derp and never have a chance to win, or everyone just assume need this nothing can be ninjad.
---
Because most people don't want to work overnight.
---
Just doesn't seem like great XP anymore. Plus it is heavily contested. Think I am too low for SM GY spellcleave?
---
Lol. Yeah, and being mind controlled and run into the lava of BRD is stopping me from getting to my group, removing the rewards I would get while they killed stuff. It's essentially griefing!
---
Yeah,  I second this. Two of my rl friends joined me in classic wow (they've never played WoW ever before) and we just enjoy doing shit together, regardless of what it is.
---
mythic jaina kill are recording even after the tier is over. use M azshara.
---
if you don't kill rag would you still say you're clearing MC? then if you don't kill azshara you aren't 'doing mythic'.
---
it's funny how classic zealot alway have to ignore content.
---
Consider yourself lucky, it sounds like you are going to get the true classic experience where MC was a mountain waiting to be conquered. I joined a zerg guild and downed rag in week 2. In hindsight, joining a smaller guild and putting in the work to build a team and start with just trash and maybe 1-2 bosses while everyone gears up and learns the fights would probably have been a lot more fun and lasted a lot longer. Don't for a second feel like you need to rush this, savour it.
---
People trading HWL back in the day was so common and you didn’t even have to be good, just play a lot...much like now!
---
Many players do this.
---
because TBC and beyond had different/better rage gen, and people went mace spec to match the stun herald
---
Did you not like Wrath?
---
I mean I personally thought that BC was better than Wrath, but Wrath wasn't exactly "bad".
---
Yes and it use to be a 3days till they were deleted.
---
They're making you waste time standing around them instead of going after other targets. That's definitely not a bad thing to be doing for your team.
---
sorta same thing happened yesterday to me and my friend. we are questing together exclusively on these characters. he is a rogue and i am a warrior. Im fairly new so i forget what the zone was called but we were killing these earth elementals for some pocketwatch thingy that gives u movespeed. So we are minding our level 36 bussiness knowing that with 3 level 40 horde mages in the area we dont really have a chance to kill any horde. And generally unless provoked we dont kill horde, and if we do its one and done. One of them kills us during a 2 mob pull, but right before we die i get a big whirlwind axe crit and rogue gets a full bleed and they die. so after being chained camped 19 times in a row we decide that once we get our chance we murder all of them. one of the mages was gone, they made a bad pull while aoe grinding. i charge, rogue gouges one, the one i charged blinks and i intercept. rogue pops off we kill both. we camp their bodies 3 times. is that really even minor payback? anyways they call in their 60 friend, the mage that left before is back, a 52 warlock shows. two level 40s getting manhandled by 36s who finally got a chance. imagine being so insecure about your ability to use frost spells, frost armor, and tons of cc as well as blinks against 2 melees that you call in 4 reinforcements after we defend ourselves.
---
Normally I'd save it, but now... oh hell yea Imma do it
---
By overall statistics do you mean blizzards honor data? If so then nope, this is exclusively addon data.
---
A weapon to surpass the bubble hearth.
---
Im confused, someone is raiding as ret?
---
Before we had the gear to comfortably down him in phase 1. The guild bought flasks for mages.
---
&gt; and those that just want to wipe the new content ASAP then quit.
---
That definitely would be me, if it weren't for all the stupid busy-work they force you to do outside of raiding.
---
I came back for legion and really enjoyed the mythic shit, playing a class with an actual skill-based rotation and pushing for top parses was awesome.
---
*BUT* I fucking *hated* all the busy-work they made you do outside of raids. All the stupid RNG forging, legendaries, and AP grind was just fucking miserable.
---
I didn't last long.
---
Have you tried turning it off and going outside when the game frustrates you? It can help your mood
---
Not get an add phase....
---
LOL this is the video game equivalent of road raging and following someone home except the guy you followed is crazier than you and you messed up.
---
Glad I’m not in your guild then.
---
obv no time slot works for everyone's hours but the 9-5ers matter more
---
He's from Faerlina. I saluted him yesterday.
---
I tried Googling strings with keywords but found nothing. It could be totally legit, I have no idea. I'm just trying to find out. The only reason I commented was because I was SURE -someone- would know the answer because the game has been around forever, but it's probably such a small problem they might even treat it case by case.
---
The closest I found was "... under malicious intent.. " to interrupt the same faction player. I would guess they just deal with it ticket by ticket and avoid a blanket policy based on what I just read.
---
I wouldn't do that publicly - too much chance you'll get reactions of apathy and shrugged shoulders. Just like in your party
---
This has lost its meaning.
---
tons of guilds actively recruiting on Fairbanks. Join the /lfg channel and keep your eyes open for guild recruit messages. It's a great server to be on
---
yup and tbh i find it healthy to have a weekly few hours off for the entire game
---
rankers get to rest etc
---
Its in chinese.
---
Well put, I also do have to remember that using language like I did in the OP can be triggering to some people because it sets a tone for the general idea, one of aggression and hostility. But if you knew me IRL you'd just chalk it up to me being rough around the edges and well, being from the Philadelphia/NY area lol
---
We're vocal about our inconveniences but thats all there is to it, just want to let our a big roar to make us feel better.

To be honest I don’t really care what you think about the downtime :) Enjoy your day sir!
---
I suspect most complainers would never use the flair because they don't seem themselves as complaining.
---
I still have no idea why you're going on and on about tanks, you've gone completely off topic. Yes of course the more tanks transition from mitigation gear to threat gear the more risky it gets which has no relevance to this conversation?
---
The original topic was mageblades on paladins vs casters (heals vs dps), it literally has nothing to do with how much mitigation vs threat gear tanks are wearing because a mage blade isn't going to make a difference when tanks get back to back crit/crushed but when they don't the mageblade in the hands of a dps vs a healer will actually speed up the fights.
---
Also I'm a healer in a high end guild and when our duel wielding tanks die due to back to back crit/crushes (which happens rarely but did actually happened last night), nobody blames the healers, we laugh, an offtank picks it up and we finish the fight no problem since shit is dying so fast because we're prioritizing gear to DPS
---
While what you're saying is true, the vastly larger servers also played a part in the the average player getting banged literally everywhere they went.
---
This is wrong, Enhancement pvp in tbc was absoloutley terrible and they were left behind while other classes went forward they got literally ZERO tools to not be kited forever.
---
Dude 1: "Yeah dude, but then you need tol go to Duakwood"
---
Dude 2: "....................................... WHAT?"
---
Thats some funny shit right there!
---
&gt; Tell me again how the gaming community isn't a toxic cesspool.
---
Who in the world says anything remotely like that?
---
Yeah because premades rolling a pug is super fun right? I love that AV ruined it for them, premades should only ever vs other premades if you actually want a challenge
---
There are no streamers getting r14 through their players but like a true psycho you came in with a chip on your shoulder about something completely unrelated and shoehorned it in.
---
I'm assuming you're horde considering you aren't able to make a premade just by qeueuing at the same time as your friends.  
---
What me and my guildies do is make it social by hanging out in discord together.  Then we all play a drinking game where when a couple of us are out of the AV, they duel or deathroll against eachother and we all place bets (sips) on who would win.
---
I play on a West Coast server from Ireland because that's where my long-time guild is, it's not great but it's more than playable.  I average around 150-200ms latency.
---
Just bought 10 seconds for someone to get the flag, or if they have it already to run with it with at least one fewer pursuer.
---
I mean, they could've made everything easy to girnd outside of raids like WOD!!  
---
I miss WoD, I had every class at cap, all raid ready! Was like, 0 to do outside of the 1 day of raiding.
---
&gt; fix the game

no changes

I am always confused by the debuff more quickly thing.  If I as a Shadow Priest just do a normal opening like MB -&gt; SW:P -&gt; MF -&gt; MF -&gt; MF I would have the debuff maxed and then it would renew with each cast right?
---
When I hear people say to use Rank 1 SW:P - wouldn't it be more beneficial to be doing top damage while putting the 5 stacks on?  My guess is the normal rotation would get the stacks up in 15 seconds tops where casting SW:P R1 five times might beat that by a few seconds because it only amounts to five global cooldowns?
---
Just curious as I have a  Shadow Priest in the 40s right now and have had that question in my head since someone mentioned spamming SW:P R1 a month ago in something I was reading.
---
Alliance exclusive frostsaber.

He's a faerlina legend. Left one of the best guilds to focus on RP

Put it this way man, most people are on the game having too much fun to worry about posting to Reddit
---
I want to play Paladin so fucking bad but everytime I'm about to reroll I remember how Holy Paladin's look like in BiS gear and just quit dreaming.
---
It's such a pity that the Holy Paladin class fantasy didn't really exist in Vanilla. I would love to be a plate wearing bringer of justice but instead I'm demoted to using a skirt and other mismatching equipment.
---
amen, premade vs pug is stupid as hell for both parties, it's boring rolling pugs and it's also stupid being rolled by premades as a pug. premades should only fight other premades
---
And you yours
---
You are probably correct in your assumption. Considering their lax rules with ninja looting and scamming mats thats been evidenced on this subreddit, I'll keep my assumption that you won't be banned or suspended from body pulling mobs into others aoe. I am making this assumption with full knowledge that this may be incorrect.
---
This was nice when the meta was zerging and Alliance could just rush quick games, but it looks like that is shifting and Horde are playing more defense.  In this situation, because their queues are longer Horde are more incentivized to win and to get the most rep/honor out of their wins whereas a lot of Alliance will settle for losing fast.
---
If they resist they are instant cast so I'm not sure its a huge deal, but agree with your reasoning. You're only talking 1 second of the curse if the warlock is on top of it, which is completely NBD out of a 60-200 second boss fight
---
It's most ideal to only run one SM/ruin for pact on tank group, and everyone else is DS/ruin for best DPS. Pact isn't that critical once your tanks are geared, though, and more DPS may be preferred.  
---
SM/ruin would get preference on a corruption slot for nightfall procs.  You typically can only afford 1 or maybe 2, though, so again its ideal not to have more than one SM/ruin warlock.

---
Thats not classic
---
Dude it’s a DPS neck, you shouldn’t roll on items not for your spec. Casters get more value from it and you have better alternatives, you have no ground to stand on
---
Yes. 2 accounts.
---
It seems the patch added the "shop" icon in the lower lfet, wasn't there before ...
---
If u are getting to submerge phase then your raid group is not running on bis most likely, because if they were u should be getting him down before submerge.
---
 Anyway, if you are getting to adds phase (and assuming you have atleast around 5 to 6 mages) have everyone in your raid gather in the same spot and then let your mages do the work (frost nova and aoe them down), u can also banish some if you want and do not let adds die near casters (they burn mana on death).
---
Hahahahah yeah what up
---
1g for a troll girl? That sure is expensive, you can get four gnomes or two night elves for it.
---
Coming from GW2 this is 100% relatable and had me in tears from laughing hahaha
---
amazing stuff
---
Again, everyone knows its a possibility whether you expect it or not. You don't have to be rude and odds are the servers don't stay down for the full 8 hours, they didn't last time. My response was also to highlight how much you are actually paying/losing during a full 8 hour downtime.
---
We’re agreeing with you... the OP you replied to is saying that it seems like everyone has the day off today but the reality is most people are at work during maintenance.
---
Cess-pool guilds can be very enjoyable, you just have to be sure you know what it is and why you're there. There's a bit of an issue that can happen when the gm or someone has big aspirations to "start raiding soon" and stuff like that, or somewhat more common to retail, "get a guild" is pushed as a solution to lack of progress, and people find one of these guilds and don't go anywhere.
---
I've had a lot of fun with a more serious guild in classic, but I've been in cesspools in the past and enjoyed it.
---
Then totally. But raid spots are hard to come by as you only need a couple
---
Reminds me back when I was AOEing the farm in Hillsbrad, another mage kept pulling mobs into my aoe so he could control the area and was ultimately successful. I just logged over to my main and went on with my day...but not before noting he was a douche in the character notes addon. Flash forward a month or so later and im organizing a strat UD group. He whispers me on this same character and I remember him thanks to the note I put on him....I decided to fuck with him a bit. 
---
Let him join the group and come all the way over to the strat UD gate from Winterspring. "Can someone open the gate please?" and thats when I kicked him. He was so confused, thought he was kicked for not having a key..but I told him why I did it and he immediately logged off.
---
The honor system was built around servers beeing down. As you seen proof of in this subreddit, there has been issues of the top of my head. Also adding stuff before major content releases
---
There is one from Uldaman that is sellable called the beacon of light.
---
I do not play a Hunter, but you do not think so? I am curious.  I feel like the 2H HW Axe would be great on an Orc for Raptor Strikes and Wing Clip.  It has heavy stats when it comes to stamina.  You have the 2x 1 handed axes for the AP buffs.  You have a crossbow that is more or less only surpassed (in the near future) by Ashjre'thul that never seems to freaking drop.  You also get a bow that is good for more sustained dps in a raid environment.  You get all of that after a certain amount of time versus tackling whether something drops and whether you get it sooner rather than later amongst other raiders in your guild.  If you do not mind, let me know why you think it is not good for a Hunter please.
---
Lmao 2 much
---
Alliance literally wins 90% of the time? Horde has just as many AFKers. Stoneform and Escape Artist are arguably more OP than WoTF.
---
yes two seperate accounts/subscriptions
---
mmmm, no.
---
the one or two instances were large-scale WPvP has been interesting does not make up for the 99,9% of instance where it's 10v1 corpse camping

I thought it was just people better at minmaxing and knowing which talents and strats were helpful?
---
They didn't actually change the gear or the fights from Vanilla, did they?
---
Thanks, but I'm looking for more in depth resources. The guides are great, but I was asking more for like, theory crafting and stuff like that. I want to be amongst my druid brethren :P
---
back in vanilla there was a really really douche bag filled guild that was actually pretty damn competent at raiding and extremely well geared.  
---
I remember they were in a feud with a smaller/less competent guild.  I honestly don't remember what the feud was about but I do remember that the douchebag guild made it their priority to basically make everyone in the other guilds life miserable.  They'd track down lvling alts and just kill everythign in their path to avoid letting them get a kill until they logged off.  They'd whisper people and tell them if they left the dungeon they were in midway there was a payout or a free MC run for them.  a lot of really petty shit that must have taken a ton of time. Not allowing the smaller guild in any BG premades, etc etc etc.
---
The small guild after 4-6 weeks of just constant bombardment transfered servers and we never really heard about them again.  
---
AFAIK everything the douchebag guild did was "legal" and they werent' breaking any rules, they were just motivated to make everyone in the other guilds life a living hell.
---
Double over and then some
---
In many cases new software can be released with zero downtime via blue-green deployments, gradual rollouts, canarying, etc. In my business, an 8 hour downtime for a software release would be a huge SLA violation. They have test realms for addressing bugs and testing changes. I don't think the expectation of a small downtime window is unreasonable.
---
The server will somehow survive if a few dozen sweaty dps miss out on ony one time, you dont *need* it for anything besides try hard parsing
---
Relax, my dude. Use this time for your weekly shower! Maybe plan out the grind for this week.
---
&gt;The unprecedented amount of ganking in p2 is the result of Blizzard changes. 5x more server pop and dropping the honor system when a lot of people were stacked up in raid gear did not happen in vanilla.
---
Aka: *"I think is much worse this time. And I don't like it"*
---
I warned people it would be this bad. Because it was bad back then.
---
... You realize I would:
---
- come home from work
---
- login
---
- spend 3 hours as a ghost
---
- logout
---
- go to bed
---
- repeat the next day
---
A month of that and we abandoned our level 60s and started over with nothing on PvE.
---
I literally could not play the game because of roving death squads.
---
No. It was just as bad back then.
---
Don't employ rose-colored glasses.
---
In April 2005 was a fresh 60, and the game had been out for 5 months.
---
And classic had been out for...4 months.
---
We were demanding free transfers off; and they wouldn't even give us that.
---
Cry some more - like I did in 2005.
---
It can be done atm by rushing them down which seems to be the go too strat in the cdl atm, it really becomes a problem in the t2 and up they just become a god class
---
I'm not even alliance, nor am I in a horde minority. But considering that "insult" and the fact that you call everything you don't agree on whining I guess you're too mentally challenged to understand empathy.
---
The easiest way is respeccing to holy nova because holy nova makes it easy.
---
You can spam oil of immolations the whole time if ur set on not respeccing. Grab some strath holy water (45 second cooldown compared to 2min on nades). Use flash heals exclusively and major mana pots. I tried to do it without using flash heals and not potting, its supremely difficult since time is everything in the event. Its doable as shadow but you will most likely go through your mana very quickly as compared having 5 points in mental agility and then another 5 in the +mana talent.
---
I mean.... I dont think that logic follows.
---
But yea, he did deserve it lol
---
Thats exactly it, the douche mage has an alliance account and a horde account for whatever reason
---
All the hate and salt is a bit harsh. People work different schedules and would like to enjoy the game that we all play. The elongated down time is inconvenient and not cool for those that have days off. That's all that was said. Telling people to go die is ridiculous.
---
appriciate that you do this, but a lot is misleading or exaggerations
---
&gt; And in this min-max meta, we're talking 8 to 10 hours a day. R10 is now a full time job  
---
nah dude...  
---
im on one of the largest servers and barely avg 5.5 a day for the week. Not even close to your 9 hr avg.
---
This effort put me, on a large server, around the 3.5 percentile
---
which is far higher than i needed to be, at far less time than you claim is needed.
---
&gt; players who are not R8+ following the reset are currently not on curve to reach R10  
---
this is just patently false  
---
sure, maybe they wont get r10 within a month, but 2 months, 3 months down the line? absolutely  
---
if you meant "by a certain date" you should say so  
---
many people who play daily will hit rank 9 passively, so just 1 month of a little extra work and they're good. maybe a month or two later than others, but its coming.
---
Hardly, he said he wouldn't make excuses for it and then went on for 10 minutes giving excuses.
---
Fuck Markymark for abusing that system.
---
Can't sheep a mob tagged by some one else.  So if bliz allows you to fear them it is working as designed.
---
(Pssst if you think this discussion is about which spec the necklace is marginally better for you’re missing the point)
---
Oh gotcha. I literary just copied and pasted the number the calculator gave me when i find the averages haha.
---
I stayed DS purely for raid #s. We run loot council so I'm trying to justify my worth by topping dps. I can run mara fine and with AV grind not being skill related there's no real need to switch. With that being said, every other lock went SM with phase 2.
---
Clearing MC in 1 hour and 10 minutes certainly isnt NEEDED but it sure is nice...Ony buff helps with that.
---
That's your own fault, should keep up to date on when the game is going down :P
---
honor has been fudging around since the honor system came out
---
some peoples honor flips over at the exact time it should
---
random people end up waiting another 24 hours for their honor to flip
---
When this occurs on... a thursday, its not a major deal... not like you can buy your new stuff friday
---
but when this happens on a Tues, it can really suck... as your wont be able to buy any new rank rewards until weds
---
are you sure it's not rare
---
This incomplete extremely old game does not have balanced skills. Shadow word pain does not tag instantly, and moonfire does. SWP you have to wait like 3 seconds before it ticks and a druid can easily just hit the skill and its tagged while SWP has already been on the mob. Are you saying the terms of service requires that druids always win this competition and a priest is not allowed to farm when a druid is farming? that is what you are saying. 
---
I think we should have the developers implement a complicated solution where placing the dot on a mob instantly tags the mob and it does not require damage. alas such a complex solution will take years before we can expect it to be developed.
---
And they might as well just grab the +33 to all damage and healing offhand from exalted AV, since it's only one less and that helps Immolate damage as well.
---
They changed that during vanilla because people where doing it to grief same faction players
---
&gt; when's tbc
---
Its out right now. You can play through most of it on retail servers... where it belongs!!
---
I did something very similar. I played alliance back in vanilla. Rolled horde in classic, got my warrior to 60 and geared out. Slowly began missing alliance zones, paladins, etc. combined that with the insane unbalanced factions on horde side, so I stopped levelling my 23 undead mage, and began levelling a gnome mage instead on a completely different server. My mage is now level 44 (most likely with 2 days rested exp since I've been grinding AV exalted on my warrior). I'd much rather have no bg queue times.  I'm hoping to have him 60 before the year is over.
---
Stop, you're making too much sense for those people.
---
&gt;If you don’t think constantly practicing something for hours a day for months and years will make someone better then I don’t know what to tell you.
---
Time alone doesn't mean shit. The time has to actually be well invested. Most people don't care about getting better, they care about having fun. There a hundreds and thousands of examples in games of players who are still stuck in lower ranks after playing the game for an eternity.
---
Omeg
---
Imagine a downtime happening years for honor, then being surprisedpikachu when it happens, during scheculed downtime... imagine...
---
I shouldn’t have to download and use another platform regularly to keep up on the game. They put links to patch notes on the launcher there’s no reason they can’t put times there :P
---
So this is how I got that hernia!
---
Where would the line be crossed in the tos by him or me when he had purposefully swooped in to take my mobs after I had casted something that takes quite of bit of mana to cast mind you. Also, there was plenty of other mobs he could have taken, but it seemed as though he waiting for me to cast SW pain then moonfired it. Happened multiple times before I did what I did. I dont think I was causing any grief to anyone, in fact I was holding my ground against someone who being inconsiderate.
---
I'm an actual pepega... I thought a guild wars 2 music guild would be trying to play wow classic theme in guild wars 2.
---
Enjoyed the video nonetheless :)
---
i agree this is scummy
---
For real. I had to scroll way too far for this.
---
OP: "My toxic friend had a toxic interaction with another toxic player. Isn't that funny?"
---
/r/classicwow: "It is totally acceptable to grief a stranger for half an hour, pursue him into another zone and grief them some more, then gloat when they are forced to flee into an instance."
---
As a warrior when im soloing/dpsing without another warrior am i supposed to just do white damage while i stack to 5 sunders on every mob?
---
Also icyveins says put points into improved rend but doesn't have rend in their suggested rotation. Do I use it?
---
&gt;This is some weird ass sinophobia
---
[The Yellow Peril mentality never faded.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Peril)
---
All I think of when I see someone who hit rank 14 is that this person has not had a comfortable poop in months. They've either been holding in their poops during games so they can go during queues, power blasting it out of their ass during a queue so they can get back to their computers so they don't miss their next game, or straight up poop socking it like an utter degenerate.
---
Next time when the urge hits you, and you're taking a comfortable 20 minute poop while browsing Reddit on your phone...think about all of the pvp rankers that won't get to experience this for week or months.
---
Much easier to get the exalted mount. It may take months and months, but you never lose your progress.
---
I'd assume alliance will get some queue time eventually as well. The BG market, especially for AV, will go down in numbers after everyone gets rep
---
Ya the top bracket on Fairbanks has a few obvious botters and it's pretty sad. Gummiwarrior and Sosa have made it really easy to gather evidence but I doubt izzard will do anything.
---
Only the other guy had both factions. Other guy got on his hord, OP used a 60 alliance to kill other guys horde.
---
The only bad thing about Wrath in my opinion was the introduction of LFG which seemingly killed server community over night.
---
Every expansion had it's dud raid (remember Hyjal Summit?) and it's poorly tuned boss (remember the "unkillable" bosses like C'Thun, Muru, and No Lights Yogg?)
---
Class balance was really good throughout Wrath (except on launch), the only issue is that classes started feeling a bit homogenized.  Whether that's a good thing depends on if you prefer class balance or a unique niche.
---
Hah love it. I am all for sharing space, but when you are an ass, I take it as a challenge. Love pvp servers for this reason. The unspoken (or spoken in this case) politics can be fun haha.   
---
Side note... didn't know they let you have an opposite fraction toon on the same server. Did that change?
---
It's not. I farm demons in WS and, since my tag takes a couple of seconds on warlock, I have people with instant/short casts steal my mobs regularly. I fear the slayers into other mobs and run away if someone steals my tag. Is it petty? Yep. Is it against the ToS? Nope. If it's the other faction, I'll banish (30 second one) the mob indefinitely until they get the hint.
---
Biggest thing for burning him before phase 2 is making sure all the caster dps in raid are full consumed, and ready to throw down. You don't need flasks, but anything else to increase damage. Since DPS can never pull aggro, this just means that right after the pull they can burn him as hard as possible without fear of dying.
---
No I'm saying a priest shouldnt go spam fear on a fucking druid that has tagged mobs inside his hurricane.  You can auto hit spawning mobs with a macro faster then a moonfire also its not possible for a druid to get every single tag
---
I’m always amazed that people have two accounts just to play both sides on a pvp server.
---
Yeah for sure, big props to him/her for the reflection.  
---
I think I'll try that sometime.
---
Unexpected deep post on WoW reddit. But yeah I +1 this statement!
---
More than likely account sharing. Our top pvper has over 1mil honor for the week and hasn't logged off all week.
---
It's really dumb. Orc and undead racials are too fucking good in pvp and if you wanna pve as horde they have some nice af racials there too with trolls and orcs.
---
"What I'm saying is that these private servers still did a better job at making a true vanilla experience compared to Classic."
---
Servers are up
---
3 hours......
---
Again they say 8 because of a possible major issue....
---
I think your 6th point might be questers. There were often 3-5 in an AV.
---
Can’t decide warrior or mage :(
---
Dude this is the first maintenance of phase 3. How can you extrapolate that to mean EVERY maintenance for the rest of classic will be this long.
---
For such a small server it has such an active and vibrant community
---
You might be right. To be honest it's very difficult to accurately track rep gains in AV, because there are so many different sources and some of them are global. 
---
The bottom line is, if you want exalted with AV, queue up, do the quests, do turn-ins, and play the game.
---
No haha, I just timed my exalted with IF well
---
Arms is the best spec for tanking 3+ mobs at a time which is what you're doing for almost every dungeon. A sweeping strikes + whirlwind opener with your 2hander before switching to sword and board is amazing initial threat that is hard to pull off of you.
---
You mean back when they actually had new content to push?
---
Yup.  I ran up on a high level guy AoE farming.  I sent him a tell asking if he'd mind taking a break while I completed a quest.  10 minutes later I was done, and he was back from his smoke break.  All in all a great interaction.
---
3 hours* 
---
its up
---
You forgot the menu and gold and stuff at the top
---
People complain about this game, but there havent been many mmos in the past decade that allow as much freedom to be good or be an asshole
---
You are not
---
I wish I had time before p2 to hit 60 lol. This kinda thing would’ve been great to do
---
For about a decade or more I thought it was real. I always kept thinking, "why don't they let this dumb cuk just die?"
---
Because you join a group and then leave it while in a dungeon. Works the same way as if you leave a group in a dungeon. Ask your friend to leave an alt offline in the group and it should work.
---
3 hours*
---
wasnt 8
---
You also get 0 honor for winning.
---
Or like, we want to play the game?
---
“You get what you fucking deserve.”
---
Experience has proven that multi boxers are not good hombres.
---
hopefully this well help server balance, not make it worse.
---
I remember that as well.
---
My b
---
GL with that SM run soon.
---
Wait wtf how many people have 60s on both factions??
---
Oh fuck
---
No? Tuesday being off for one of those people wouldn't even dent 10% of their weekly game time. 
---
People like me who only have 1 day a week off is more significant with almost 30 to 40% of my game time coming in on the off day.
---
Didn't mind that Tuesday patches used to be 10 to 15 minutes but apparently now I'm just supposed to accept they will be 8 hours from now on? Guess I need to ask for a work schedule change.
---
I know why.  What I'm saying is that blizzard decides what is and isn't doable so if they allow you to fear mobs tagged by other players than it isn't against tos to do so otherwise they wouldn't allow it ala the way sheep is banned
---
oic, congrats! im dumb.
---
There is a secret campaign in Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne called, "The Founding of Durotar" with a full-sized Warcraft 3-based map of Durotar, complete with quests and everything. It was added to the Warcraft 3 in patch 1.13 in 2003 so it was a framework for WoW before we even had WoW.  
---
You play the role of Rexxar assisting Thrall with taming the lands for the Horde to establish their homes. It is effectively the Horde's backstory for World of Warcraft.

If you would rather watch it than play it:

I don't think that they'll quit from burning out, I think they'll quit cause they'll realize how naive they've been. There were hundreds of horde on my server parked at flightpaths all over Azeroth ganking allaince in order to squeeze out a few more HKs to get the next rank. 99% of them will not reach rank 14, and a good 50% of them will finally realize it over the next 2 weeks. I wish I could be there to see their faces.
---
"stop playing games DIFFERENTLY THAN ME REEEE" - you
---
Alliance on Sulfuras! Hope to see you in.... Arathi Basin!
---
family helps being unemployed actually
---
Letting? She played before I met her 5 years ago xD she hated retail, classic first time we got to play with each other.
---
neets have life
---
2 accounts, you can link both to the same bnet account. This way you can use your retail gold to fun multiple accounts.
---
even as arms you gonna lose wpvp
---
warriors have no abilities or utility to tango w/ the overloaded kits many dps classes have
---
Game ruined
---
Stupid Chinese porn
---
That's fixed by alliance all quitting the PvP servers. Also should be better now that BG's are out.
---
Finally settled on warlock
---
Take away here is that Might Shoulders and the crown of destruction are probably the two coolest looking items in the game. And that the hand of rag hits like a truck in PvP on a warrior.
---
Yeah they existed in game just as cross BGs did but not until the end of vanilla. Naxx had been out for a long time by the time we got both of these things. And blizz had a six month cool down on transfers originally too. Bet that isn’t a thing right now. 
---
Blizzard doesn’t get it. They heard why we loved vanilla. Communities. Rivalries. Cross realm battlegrounds killed the rivalry aspect. All the fun pvp and competition with my realm(Heartseeker) ended the moment they added BGs. Now all the rivalries I’d built up with alliance and vice versa are done since I won’t see those people anymore. And communities? Well that’s hard to have when you transfer around.
---
This is going to just create a bunch of EU-Draenors.
---
All 10 bosses killed
---
No, I have a hunter, rogue, and priest all in the low 30s, and a druid in the mid 20s.  Just can't settle on one…
---
The cold reality will be sinking in for many today. I had 300k honor on the week. Mostly from AV and getting my rep. I moved from Rank 6 55% to Rank 7 15%. 
---
Another week or two and there will be a mass fall off in participation.
---
Correct.
---
You sound like a POS and I'm sure you know it
---
&gt;**after 5 months**.
---
I used the same metric you did lmao
---
&gt;then if you don't kill azshara you aren't 'doing mythic'

In TBC, due to the token mechanic, you wanted to farm heroics and raids anyway. Since you ran those anyway, you would get the needeed quest items anyway.
---
Doing the attunements in order was not an issue, as long as you didn't start at the very end.
---
This is even more amplified with a staggered release of content. Even when there is no attunement for Karazhan, with only heroics and T4 content avaible you will eventually fullfill the attunement quests anyway.
---
Dungeon attunement was a different thing and could be skipped anyway, except for the heroic requirement (which involved reputation). But since you wanted to farm heroic dungeons, you did that anyway. And with how hard heroic dungeons were tuned, you had to farm the normal version to gear up first. (Not to mention you got a decent amount of reputation just from questing up to 70)
---
This is unlike Classic where you had to do steps that interrupted what you actual want (farming the note outside of brd, doing an escort, gathering materials to pay, other random drop stuff).
---
It's really not that bad. I've played an Alliance warlock since 2004 WoW. All WOTF really does is take away your choice of when to use death coil; you have to use it to neutralize their wotf pop.
---
Is there any way for a Druid to beat a Lock in PVP?
---
No.
---
It’s just us trying to get people to use it more often so people can filter what they want to see man. No big deal.
---
I remember the old days of Classic,  3 months ago when Reddit was full of posts about the joy of Classic and everyone was giving each other gold. Ah those days.
---
I'm beyond stoked about it.
---
Literally saved the future of my toon.
---
I agree and I think swp and other dots should tag a mob, but if me and a priest are farming an area and a mob spawns we both run for it I'm hitting it with moonfire
---
You buy two accounts and maintain two subs
---
I haven't seen anything definitive yet, but it appears that the bosses are either immune to it or it's so low priority that it gets knocked off my almost everything.
---
I have today off from the weather, the timing sucks :(
---
even then death bringer in OH is horse shit, you much rather want a rlly fast offhand for rage regen and Heroic strike hits.
---
Does this kind of behaviour happens often on NA/UK/EU-english servers ?
---
Never see anything like that on my foreign server.
---
That’s exactly why it IS against TOS. If you tell someone “hey I’m gonna go on my other account that has a character on the other faction and do x action in game” that is against TOS.
---
Dungeons aren't tuned as hard as pservers so you shouldn't be hit too hard.  I'd say you can start farming brd arena and angerforge at 55 which might take you all the way to 60 before you get HoJ and SGC.  Mix in some emp runs at 58 for some more tanking gear.  You'll be in a great position to run anything after hitting 60 then.
---
People will swap to servers that have their own faction majority and the 50/50 servers will get skewered by big pvp guilds on horde side, calling it. i will genuinely be surprised if the 50/50 pvp servers don't get fucked.
---
When will servers be up?
---
Sometimes I feel like Blizzard is trying to min/max how quickly they can kill off this game.
---
\&gt; horse characters
---
Oh yeah.
---
You can if you have two accounts, though.
---
Lol can you fucking read? IF YOU ARE BOTH ON THE SAME FACTION WHILE TALKING IT IS NOT TOS OMG
---
How is this againsr rule 4? Its just a hide spot or am I wrong? 
---
You dont glitch threw walls or anything else
---
Is this real?
---
I’ll take the blame for my vague title
---
Currently on a PVP server and want to transfer to a PVE server today, Alliance player.
---
Anyone know which PVE servers has a good economy and large population?
---
How is the population/playerbase on the RP-PVE server, I am interested in that also?
---
Thanks in advance, at work for several more hours and most gaming websites are blocked.
---
good lord this advice
---
What's wrong with enjoying engaging pve content? I like retail for those reasons, I enjoy retail pvp, and I also love classic's world building.
---
Doesn't have to be tribalistic. Also the fact y'all think Blizzard is giving classic huge downtime to get you playing retail is laughable. It really doesn't even make sense. You're just paranoid schizos if you genuinely think that is Blizzard's plan
---
The people raging here on Reddit are the people who nolife the game, are always salty no matter what, and use these forums and subreddits to bitch about the game when they cannot play the game.  Maybe their mom has taken them to the store to buy Christmas presents, but they are staying in the back seat of the minivan while she shops. They are angrily replying to people on Reddit while planning the optimal farm location of small eggs and trending ah data for when to post them.
---
Tldr fuck these morons, go enjoy the game.
---
This makes the complaint posts so much funnier.
---
Super fun ways to mess with a rude person AoE farming (esp a Mage) is run in their blizzard and fear the mobs. Hilarious.
---
Last week,
---
"We may implement this in the future"
---
One week later...
---
5x sw:p gets it up in 7.5 sec.
---
Please don't. We're happy as we are.
---
They have an easier time applying faerie fire quickly.
---
That's essentially all they do
---
play something else while you wait
---
I should have phrased my question differently. I meant what is better for raiding.
---
Slam spec is only better on alliance. Horde use hamstring for wf over slam
---
Dang, now we are going to have everyone crying about transfers and BGs!
---
wrong
---
Is the cooldown for HK diminishing returns the same in a BG as they are in the world?
---
Cloudkeeper dropped in a guildies AV and Skullflame in anothers... insanity
---
fuck you blizzard
---
After you get exhalted with Alterac Valley, you can purchase a mount for 720gold.
---
Is this mount usable all across the world or only on battlegrounds?
---
Also, while I have your attention, the 2 handed mace you can buy ( I forget the name ) for 140 gold - is that better than a Molten Core 2 hander that might drop? ( Asking as an enhance shaman)
---
Thanks in advance
---
Classic doesn’t have a way to participate in competitive pvp- it just doesn’t exist. You may get small, small tastes of it if you happen to be doing a premise vs premade WSG/AB...but let’s be real 95% of your matches are going to be against uncoordinated randoms. Arenas were one of the great addons to the game..hoping we see them in some iteration of classic.
---
It is possible.
---
They saw that horde were having issues and so this was the solution
---
&gt; it is impossible to get any gear on a raid with 10 additional mages as a casual
---
Even as a non-casual it's tough to get any of the good drops since most of the BiS has a pretty low drop rate and is shared between all casters (MIC, Choker of the Fire Lord, Band of Spellpower). 11 or 12 weeks and my guild still hasn't seen the spellpower ring, and only one choker and two MICs. Mageblade and SoD are also shared but have a relatively higher drop rate (like 75% that one or the other will drop).
---
An alliance player calling Heartseeker a cesspool? kek.
---
I ended up buying crusader enchant just because people don’t get that there mobs up and down so split the levels and share the mobs. Had a mage kept running up and down the tower tagging them all the time. I hope he is still farming and never gets the enchant to drop. Thankfully I sniped it at a low price of 250g. Totally worth it vs the aggravation he caused
---
I always wonder what these dudes are like in restaurants. You know the types, who always harp on about "entitlement". Would they complain if the meal took an hour to make? If it showed up cold, or undercooked? Or would that make them "spoiled" too?
---
What I do is I just dont move til the person hands over every single item in the chest through trade. But both my chars are tank and healer so yeah im pretty important to proceed the dungeon. If the guy is gonna be a dick then everyone will suffer the consequences of his actions not just me. Worst that can happen is they kick me and Im happy about it because Id rather not be grouped with that person anyways, or they kick him and he gets replaced within an instant. Either way in wasting that persons time until they embarassingly trade me everything and look like a beta or they leave/I leave and waste a greater amount of their time.
---
I've seen a few people who use the scroll wheel for attack/passive. how do you zoom with this setup?
---
It is possible
---
Forrest Gump was such a crazy good movie
---
Hahaha ain't that the truth.
---
I charge+thunderclap switch to def demo roar then tab sunder. Mark skull for main target and x for second. 
---
Never had any issues unless the single target dps decides to just start frostbolting random mobs. But then I just taunt and sunder once and its all good.
---
still, people say from the old days that they had to rotate turns who becomes rank 14 that week... so it wasnt possible to  have more than 1 at rank 14 then? 
---
Purely because server population?
---
At this very moment my honor spy has 149 pool size and only one person in the highest bracket. 2 in the second aswell as third, 4 in the 4th bracket.
---
Will  just have to wait and see how many rank 14s we begin seeing around once the realistic time for them has arrived.
---
Anyone on a full/high populated server who could share their standings? Its tuesday now so  your standings should be as accurate as they can get.
---
Literally unplayable.
---
the 60/40 and 55/45 servers are def gonna be screwed over now.
---
that's wrong, so many situational OH you want to use in pvp which makes staff just bad overall
---
weapon procs are are the lowest priority of debuff, so basically everything knocks it off. However it might conflict with annihilator, i'm not sure.
---
Lol true
---
Slim chance
---
Well that had always been the case
---
You can use the mount everywhere. 
---
It really depends on the 2 handed Weapon from molten core. It is better than most but as an Orc the Axe from Ragnaros is also really good.
---
This is going to kill more realms than help them.
---
Why? Because making bad XP for me is not nearly as bad as it is for you, since I obviously don't have anything else to do - so if I spend 2 hours in the evening preventing you from playing, that's just 2 of 15 hours of my daily gametime, while it might be all you have. I'd consider that a win.
---
I ended up around 50 games won, and lost about 22-25 as alliance. (I think I forgot to screenshot the first 4 or so losses so can't be sure, so raised it to 25 just Incase.
---
Nearly a 70% win ratio after getting Exalted, and honestly 10 of those losses where just joining in progress horde favored turtles.
---
The 15ish games that the horde won that I joined fresh ended at like 30-40 minutes and the alliance gave up if the Zerg failed like 10 minutes in. It was a miserable grind to exalted, even when winning most of every bg we did. Fighting within our ranks starts in the waiting room between the drek people and the galv people.
---
We often got less honor even when winning as Alliance, until we started to adjust to new hordes new strats and went Galv, LT's,  then leave 5-6 Alliance art frost wolf graveyard, and kill drek.
---
I knocked primalist close to spend last night to cover a choke point
---
Making another account and talking with someone by making a character on the opposing faction is exactly “finding a way around the in game text scrambling” it doesn’t matter how they do it, as long as that is what’s happening. People have been banned for it before so you’re obviously wrong. Can you fucking learn basic comprehension skills?
---
Your actions noted with your new notice. Furthermore, now that we have noticed your notice we shall take note and proceed properly to continue to use the megathread. 
---
Thank you for notifying the community,
---
I’m 22 outta college and using a laptop as a desktop
---
We have a dwarf/gnome guild, we also take nelf druids as strippers obviously.
---
Did the exact same thing in Classic, but from Alliance to Horde.  It is good to be home.
---
You can play just fine now. There’s pretty much no one ganking right now.
---
For the 3% Spellcrit-Aura, I guess.
---
Shazzrah mage here, will always give portal after run. Even two if groups want to. Disclaimer: sometimes I use teleport instead of portal.
---
New stuff always means a longer patching window; fixes/patch volume, caching, spot checking, validations,  etc. are going to take longer the first patch after a major
---
"trolls eat people"
---
Don't shame trolls for using all of the human. Trolls aren't wasteful like alliance races.
---
There are 4 main troll tribes allied with the horde. The Darkspear, the Zandalari, the Shatterspear, and the Revantusk. Horde was briefly allied with the Amani as well but that was the second war.
---
This also defies my point. Dishonorable humans claim orcs are here to steal their land but every human or elf settlement sits upon a veritable graveyard of troll corpses. Hell the first race to go to war with the trolls outside of old god/titan created races wound up being a devolved version of trolls and they were so irresponsible they split apart the gd continent. Trolls fight the aqir for thousands of years, fracture their empire and prevent the world from falling to the old gods and then these dumb upstarts are like, "hey how about this burning legion thing? let's throw their boss an invite I hear he throws mad awesome parties." Next some even further corrupted trolls (they called themselves high-elves I believe) built a city in a place where trolls were like "hey that's our land and also it's sacred don't build a city there", then have to bring in the physically deformed offspring of vrykull that stole troll land to live on and then are all like "Hey we won we're fucking heroes!". Jackasses.
---
"Trolls eat people" is just an excuse to continue persecution of Azeroth's oldest native race and continue stealing their land in the name of "justice". I'm sure you guys would have used pox blankets if trolls weren't so resistant to disease. Trolls were here first keeping Azeroth safe and you filthy humans think because you worship "the light" it makes you inherently honorable. PAH! I spit on your shoes!
---
minority that rises to the top and controls policy making, ensuring their own continued existence.
---
yeah sounds about right
---
Found the toxic player
---
Checked alot and it looks like mirage and netherkeep is one of the best. The other one is very small, keep off that
---
Also, there are plenty of spots you can AOE grind the jokerd did not use. On any high pop server the spots jokerd used are going to over run with other mages trying to do the same. Unless its 3am.
---
I used handy notes to mark out all the aoe farm spots I discovered myself. The xp or gold per hour might be a tiny bit lessthan the more popular spots but its worth it when no one bugs you for 5 hours straight.
---
alex was right... lol
---
There was a dude in discord saying his tank was using it for an MC and the logs didn't record a single second of the debuff applying to a boss which would mean they are immune to it, but I didn't look at the logs so I can't really confirm that.
---
I had a friend who bought cheap items from someone on the neutral faction auction house; turns out it was a Horde trading stuff to his Alliance character (think like 20-50g item for 1 copper in around the 3-4th week of the game). 
---
Anyways he messaged my friend asking for the item back explaining what he was doing, so my friend told him sorry about the situation but that was the risk he was taking doing that and he would be keeping the item. The guy proceeded to message him daily in wording that was creepy/hostile but subtle basically mentioning he would be camping him until he returned the item. My friend was like level 54 or 55 at the time.
---
He ended up being a 5x multiboxing warlock that would find and camp my friend \*anytime\* he logged on. Luckily after like a full week or two of it happening my friend hit 60 and didn't really go out and about anymore with layering now bring removed.
---
People can be so weird on this game lol, he did ignore and report him BTW; Blizzard told him that there was nothing they would do about it. Even though I would consider it harassment at that point, but whatever lol.. it is all in the past now (hopefully).
---
It is not ninja’ing. If you are going into an AV with the hope of getting items out of it, then their is clearly something wrong with you. The same dungeon loot rules do not apply in a battleground. A battleground is a literal free for all, cross server fiasco. If you expect 39 other people to pass just because you can use it, you are delusional.
---
Don't shame me!  My mount is economically efficient!
---
Exactly. Absorb them, get them what they need and they will move on.
---
It took my coalition about 10s to kill kazzak on feralina the other day. Horde didn’t even have time to intercept.
---
Haha get rekt fp ganker
---
In the real world, there are a lot more obstacles to min-maxing, and its tough. Doing it in a game usually takes time, and some dickery to screw people over to get to your goals faster.
---
that would be a bad design since if people ress one at a time because they also died one at  a time (its rare for people to die and release exactly at the same second) so then they  can easily be farmed in the GY by the opposing team since they only ress one player at a time.
---
Ressing them all in waves every 30 seconds helps with this so if theres 30 players ressing at the same time you have better chance of breaking out. People would have to wait anyway, noone is taking on 20 enemies alone. :S
---
6 hours later.. (SpongeBob narrator voice)
---
What if your guild is pro life and doesn't allow fire abortion pots?
---
You can't be this dumb.
---
Blizzard does not have a staff that maintains their servers.
---
They are outsourced. 
---
THE ACTUAL MAINTENANCE IS NOT APPLICABLE TO QEEKLY MAINTENANCE YOU DUMB FUCK.
---
Yeah it was.
---
#JustPVEserverThings
---
5 r1 sw:p is also a super safe opener vs instant high threat mind blast
---
Im sure they can be decent. Not inviting someone into a party and then getting angry they snagged the quest is just entitled.
---
I ran a couple of sims for you. TUF is decent but the closest you'll get is stormstrike hammer and mirah's song. The difference is not worth grinding for dal rends imo. Dalrends @245dps stormpike/mirah's @241
---
Someone doesn’t understand subjects of a sentence. THAT IS APPLYING TO THE PERSON PLAYING, not the one doing the talking.
---
i watched this happening to Smite sub, I dont want this place to the same
---
Rage generation is normalized, so weapon speed has no impact on rage generation. You're just choosing between more frequent, but smaller rage chunks vs. less frequent, but larger rage chunks. In the end, an offhand deathbringer would generate more rage. As rage generation is tied directly to weapon DPS.
---
A slower offhand weapon also gives better flurry uptime. Weapon DPS/stats are the most important factors, but when all other factors are relatively equal, the slower offhand is superior.
---
While back. 
---
As I was waiting for Solenor the Slayer to respawn (aka Nelson the Nice Gnome) for my hunter quest. A group of Horde came to the spot too. Obviously, out numbered. I cannot contest this NPC anymore. So I did the normal belly roll tactic. Some waves, some jokes, some points and /question. Yup, they are here for the hunter quest too. 
---
Lock, shaman, hunter, and rogue. Hunter gets curse of recklessness on him from the Lock. He pulls Solenor. Shaman drops ground totems for him (ultimate cheese BTW). And he makes quick work of him. And they all leave.
---
I had been having issues with this last Demon. He seems to be resetting when he death coils you. And I was learning the best way to kite him around the Ahn'Qiraj. Trying to not do the cheese strat.
---
Fast forward 20 minutes. Nelson (aka Solenor) Re-spawns right in the same spot! What are the odds! I talk to him to trigger the demon form. Pop my potions, hunters mark, etc. And right as I am about to pull... BAM. Curse of recklessness on me???
---
The Warlock came back and gave me curse of recklessness...
---
 **:( :( :(** 
---
Gives me a /cheer and I proceed to pull and kill the demon. Completing my hunter quest. We exchanged formalities and went out separate ways. Sometimes... it's small things like this that make wanting to kill the opposite faction somewhat harder if not out right questionable.
---
And the lord said “let the shit show begin!”
---
Good riddance Skeram!
---
Thats about right yes. After dinner, cleaning up, doing the dishes and sometimes a bit of overtime work, I play from 20 to 22 most nights. Some nights I can't and some weekends I get a little more playtime.
---
imagine not being able to play 6 hours a day
---
I don’t even have kids and 4 hours on a Saturday sounds like a ton.
---
It's almost like if you stop playing WoW at some point you don't get to gradually watch it evolve and it's foreign when you come back.
---
This is what happens when 60 bots are in a game together.
---
What else did they do? I feel like you already jumped the gun from this one thing
---
Best campaign ever
---
Damn I am missing out on the real WoW experience by not playing with people like this
---
**Appeared** to go uncounted. It's a display-only issue, literally every statement about it says they still have all the raw data.
---
2.0 came before tbc we had arenas and lfg in vanilla for a while
---
This community in a nutshell. Lmao
---
I keep wanting to come back, but every week there’s something stopping me from resubbing. I don’t wanna end up on a dead server or play on my current one and have it dominated by horde.
---
You could also just login to confirm it yourself like I did.  It's there, and I can xfer.  Have you ever tried to confirm things before posting?
---
Reddit is free though
---
The fact you want to argue this just makes you look horribly obtuse.  
---
Loading up a character, while still playing the other faction so you can personally gain from disrupting someone elses gameplay, is the point.
---
You should check your reading comprehension friend. I responded to your reply in the post you replied to.
---
That’s just strange to me. I don’t think I’d even bother playing at that point.
---
Most of the people who enjoy the game are playing instead of posting on reddit. As a whole with anything online people are more likely to make a post about something that upsets them instead of something they enjoy.
---
Easy money lmao
---
Omg soneone isnt fully min maxing lets get him!
---
The truth is a lot of warlocks wont get those situational items. They will want to pvp in bgs and having a stat stick with slightly less spellpower a better scenario than a pve 1h oh set up. Is this optimal? Not at all but it is viable, and something a lot of people will do.
---
Shhh that makes too much sebse
---
It's referring to the object of the sentence, which is the enemy player. So long as they are playing the same faction as you at the time of communication, it's not tos dude. Like come the fuck on.
---
Seriously? Fuck.
---
Lmao at people who think they speak for the whole community
---
Imagine a guild of multi boxers
---
I was farming and some guy said I had to leave or he would kill me, I said were the same faction... he says he has an alliance character too. Turns out that's against TOS so when he came I reported both characters for harrassment and he hasn't been on since
---
7 days is a lie. A quick look at the below will break it down. I also think your comment doesn't achieve anything but negativity. 
---
https://www.warcrafttavern.com/news/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-to-level-60-in-wow-classic-an-objective-look/
---
I agree. People invest themselves in too many things then complain about not having any free time.
---
Man that was some of the most fun I’ve had in any game. The first 2 years of GW2 were magical.
---
Maybe take your genius over to Blizzard and show them how to do a proper server maintenance.
---
When someone dies on the opposite faction, you can right click their corpse and remove insignia. When you do this, you will get items like armor scraps, lieutenant's blood, etc. In your home base, there is an NPC who accepts blood in stacks of 5 for 5 AV rep, and 50 orgrimmar rep, or stacks of 1 for 1 AV rep and 10 orgrimmar rep.   
---
So OP is saying if you are not an Orc, and wanted to ride a wolf as like an undead, you can use this method to farm Orgrimmar rep to exalted, thus allowing you to ride that race's mount.
---
How do you get the rage for that? You need to be in berserker stance for WW so as soon as you switch you have 25 rage and then it starts to decay. I'm low level (30) and I've just been pooling rage and tab sundering while using my 2hander the whole time. I think at higher levels the lack of a shield will hurt me but maybe not.
---
Agreed, it's pretty fun other than I wish i could queue with 1 or 2 ppl. I love that it stops wsg from being purely a premade borefest
---
Just stay Arms. Tactical mastery and sweeping strikes are money for tanking 5-mans.
---
So let me get this straight to make sure I understand you correctly.  After a misunderstanding with someone you spitefully turned it up to 11 and got them kicked from their guild.  Am I reading that right?  Is your ego so easily bruised that the only logical recourse is to potentially significantly and negatively impact this guy's gaming experience more so than was your experience?  You must be a delight to work the Wendy's drive thru with.
---
I really hope so!
---
Does the item disappear when event is over? Save me. I'm at work and cannot research.
---
If it’s not tos then why are people banned for the same action as in the post? Blizzard has decided it is against tos and you arguing differently isn’t going to change that.
---
That's a pretty normal time commitment to someone with a full time job and other responsibilities
---
Also of note if you get to rank 3 pvp you get a further 80g discount
---
After hitting 999/1000 with org, the turn ins start giving 2.5 rep to the other horde factions too. 2.5 to UC, TB, DT.
---
What do you use to sim dps for classic?
---
This seems like a double edged sword tbh. People complaining about not being able to level on pvp servers will benefit however the server they leave behind will potentially suffer unless people who stuck on pve servers choose to transfer over to said pvp server, idk. Hopefully this won't kill off realms.
---
When you have the pvp pieces and weapons, you need way less gear from AQ40 and Naxx.   
---
With other warriors needing weapons, shoudlers, chromatic boots (r12 boots are near equal), you being Rank 14 means you only need a few pieces of gear and loot council is basically forced to give you those pieces.
---
Is there a limit on how many times you can transfer? What’s stopping people from transferring to a low pop realm, ranking up by grinding AV, then transferring back?
---
“When will THEN... be now?”  
---
“Soon.”
---
With buffs?? Our melee are sitting around 1k, so double yours?
---
Well that's adult life to many people mate. That doesn't mean you can't enjoy a game :)
---
A while back I was waiting for the Fordring escort in WPL when a red name came into the room. Then another. Then another. Full party of five red names sitting waiting for the respawn. Sadly I'm a rogue and was quicker on the draw. I sat spam clicking where he was going to pop up and did the fastest mousework of my life to nab it before any of them could, then popped Vanish and Sprint to book it to the basement before any of them could CC me.
---
Was it a dick move? Yes.
---
Was it still really funny watching all the AoE effects lighting up the floors above me? Absolutely.
---
Only thing I regret was the friendly rogue I passed on the way out, who wasn't as slippery as me. F.
---
Taunting as opposed to mocking blow, would give the tank the same threat as the person he taunted from, so they would both have very high threat. Yes I imagine it is annoying for healers but wanted to clear up that both would have high threat
---
Have you checked out your server this last week?  Things have really mellowed out since bgs were released.  I spent 6 hours farming the other day and not one gank attempt.  Whitemane alliance.
---
This is when you tell him "My main is (guy you you hate), but you'll never manage to do anything to me, my guild won't believe you, I'll just deny everything. Kek."
---
He's pretty cute! I'm interested to see what happens at 60 😜
---
You can just right click the minimap icon and hit enter there too.
---
Or in a bid to retain what little population they were retaining they made it foreign.
---
This quest in particular has a very low drop rate but there were plenty of mobs to go around, he had no problem tagging his own, was just being greedy.
---
I've got most of my alts parked in one. It doesn't really make sense to bother my actual guild, since p much all of the active players are 60 and raiding.
---
I'm starting to believe there's more than one person on reddit
---
You're saying arguing makes me look obtuse...while arguing on the losing side. Like fuck man the writing is clear english and basically no legalese to read. It couldn't be MORE clearly NOT against TOS.
---
lol what? who is saying druids shouldn't compete for tags? 
---
we're saying you shouldn't steal them when there is already a dot on it...
---
That's why you get both
---
Careful! Youre going against the circle jerk my man! Retail bad, classic gud!  People arent allowed to enjoy both!
---
Enh shaman, definitely. 
---
I mean...what are really your other options ?
---
Really? So it will be 640 instead of 720? Are there further discounts If I get to say, rank 4 or 5?
---
&gt; Everyone I know who started in wrath prefers wrath,
---
I mean if they started in Wrath then they wouldn't have played TBC or Vanilla while it was current content so for them to say TBC or Vanilla would be disingenuous.  
---
There are absolutely grips you can throw at Wrath.  It started the "accessibility train" that many players rightly believe ruined the game.  LFG killed server community.  The first raiding tier was hilariously undertuned (Ensidia killed the entire tier within 3 days of the expansion launching).  It proliferated the catchup gear system (AKA wellfare epics) after every major patch to help get players geared up for the new raid which made the previous raids irrelevant. 
---
For all of what it did wrong it did many things right.  Whether someone prefers it over TBC depends on whether they value what was gained or what was lost more.
---
Does this include a faction transfer? That is what they should have released
---
1- yes, it's absolutely worth playing even if you're totally new to it.  It's a great game, there's tons of lore to explore.  It's a lot slower paced than retail or modern games and doesn't really hold your hand at all.
---
2-its a standalone client but it's built on the modern game so I'm not sure how big it is.  The system requirements are fairly modest, only calling for 5GB of drive space.

I really like Auctioneer + Auctinator together for the AH.  It makes the whole experience less painful, you can post auctions and tweak things like stack size, see per-item price, etc.   Neither is perfect, but together they're great.  They overlap in features, but you'll find each does something better than the other.  I do not like TSM, it dumbs things down too much, and the realtime and cross-realm pricing are less useful than you might think since markets move and people can also manipulate TSM's dumb pricing model (i.e. post whites for 200g). 
---
Details! with threat meter is essential for some DPS classes, particularly warlocks who don't have threat mitigation.  It has heal meters as well, I think dispell counting, etc. if you want to try performance. 
---
Warcraftlogs uploader.  It's useful for your raid to look over your parses to spot problems and improve your raid. 
---
I consider my long path of installing Elvui and tweaking it for many hours over a few months to now be an essential part of my play.  I've carefully tweaked it to help manage raid debuffs, watch my own debuff timers, etc.  It's not a quick setup, you'll have to immerse yourself a bit and invest the  time, but I think overall its a huge upgrade.
---
Imagine being a nobody streamer
---
Let the man play on a potato if he wants, the more the merrier
---
Excellent, that's about what mine's sitting at.
---
I love both i just can't stand  that BFA is basically a giant gold drain/"serious" raiding alliance side is pretty much dead. And the whole everything being a massive fucking grind thing. Mythic raiding's fun though but i just can't be bothered. Don't really get the massive hatred for anything outside of classic
---
Keep the balanced servers hidden and safe!
---
Considering rerolling my warrior alt because a friend/guildie/bitter rival likes to purposefully mispronounce my name to troll and the one he came up with the other night had me laughing for a solid minute. I definitely want to us it for an alt but I already have an alt of each class. The warrior is one of the lowest at only level 10 and it's a fitting warrior name so I might reroll and level it up a bit when I get tired of the AV grind.
---
Don't want to. Anyway it ended like an hour ago, so that's really comfy. 3 hours is much more palatable than 8
---
When off hand procs it uses MH for swing?
---
I have no idea what my other top tier options are, it's my first time playing shaman, or any type of meele class, so I honestly am completely in the dark
---
Getting raped daily cause of faction imbalance makes people quit sooner.
---
it says it all over the place lol.  Number 1 or 2 comment on wowhead classic even states "grind mobs then use stones after revered" lol
---
Someone tells you the truth and you get mad. How about reevaluate your insecurity.
---
Good shit! Make him eat his words
---
I literally see Firewater,Mongoose + Squid and they still pull 500. Oh please son. With buff's I'm around 600 I never said ret paladin was great. Thanks for your trash input tho.
---
You sure it wasn’t a noggenfogger elixer?
---
I love these points, but I'm glad they didn't do that. Plus, it would simply have made the Horde the  unimpeachably good faction vs. the corrupt Alliance. There's already too few reasons to roll Alliance. And the "might makes right" method of succession is arguably just as toxic as royalty. I think it works as a romanticized fantasy; because we are forced into playing for factions, we want our 'leaders' to be likeable. And for a while, both leaders of the Alliance and Horde had an argument for being the good guys. Actually the faction war didn't make much sense until Wrath. What might have worked instead is having no starting factions and gaining rep with one or another, like the Aldor/Scryers. I don't think anyone starts to think that monarchy is a good idea from playing WoW though. It's just an obvious shortcoming of the MMO genre I think.
---
You can also alter your text files if you don't want to bother with needing to get an addon
---
Not all multiboxers are jackasses. I 2 box and I gladly invite people to my party for shit like escort or kill quests.
---
That's insane lol
---
Have you logged in during the last week? The world is completely different after BG release.
---
They are not the best damage dealers, but they are good for control with there tools. Repentance + improved hammer of justice are great tools for locking down a single or multiple targets. It terms of damage pretty much everyone beats you, so you kinda act like an escort or support. If you are doing warsong gultch they make great escorts. I am mostly holy paladin, so other people should chime in.
---
Thanks I'll still run UBRS to get my quests done but I definitely won't chase DR over 4 DPS (even if I do prefer Swords over Maces)
---
I don't know who is the bigger dick there buddy....
---
You or the Druid....
---
The felwood satyr farming spots are a pretty contested area cross faction or same faction. For said reasons of the Demonic runes, you could go to azshara too you know¿ Instead of greifing people into oblivions
---
What class would you think is best to have an alt as?
---
Pretty decent on druid also
---
Servers eventually become pve anyway. Once one faction has an advantage, because one side has better racials or whatever other reason you can think of, it's over. The people who want to have a bigger pool of guilds to apply to will go to that faction and then it cascades from there. Go to wowprogress and see. Basically every server is either a horde or alliance pve realm.
---
If they don't lock paid transfers to faction dominated server players  to faction minority servers I'm going to be appalled. Everyone will just transfer off their faction imbalanced server onto a server where their faction is the majority..
---
Yes, whichever is rested :-)
---
The other Addon is called Better Vendor Price. Sorry for the late reply.
---
Did you read all my post or what? Because I literally said they were in my post.
---
If you can't compete stay outta the street. OP can compete, sounds like you can't
---
Start in zerk stance, activate zerker rage, switch to battle, charge, auto, sweeping strikes, auto, switch to zerk, whirlwind, switch to defensive stance + sword and shield, tab sunder.
---
I don’t think there’s any horde camps/quest hubs in darkshire. It’s pretty much alliance only from what I understand.
---
We knew this would be coming. 
---
Were paid faction changes available in vanilla?
---
Got a warrior to 35, then a lock to 60, then a shaman to 38, mage to 25, leveled a rogue to 10 last night and a hunter to 10 a couple days before.
---
I'll probably take the shaman all the way next then the rogue.
---
shhhh🤫
---
What you're saying is that you're borderline illiterate and you utterly missed his defensiveness in the comment above. That's okay though.
---
Yes I can confirm that sulfuras is a terrible server which is why no one hears about it. It's just awful. Steer clear
---
I play alliance.  I will transfer to an alliance dominated pvp server and I will have my revenge.
---
I can't speak for all multiboxers and I just 2 box, but I have no problems forming groups or playing nice with others.
---
Well I know plenty of adults who have mortgages and family but are irresponsible and will probably lose it all in the next recession. So it did t occur to me that those implied you were responsible.
---
Server transfers yes - mid 2006 (TBC came out in jan 2007)
---
Faction and race changes came later

He said rank 10 was going to take 8 hours a day. It's less than half of that. And "casual" is relative and a subjective word.
---
I screwed up when starting classic. At first I started as an Alliance hunter and loved it. Then I made a nelf rogue and got to 51, and for some stupid reason, deleted it and rerolled undead mage on the same realm. Got to 60 via AoE grinding and instantly got bored afterward. So I rerolled to Benediction alliance, again, as a dwarf hunter. I'm now the same level as my original dwarf hunter and loving it. I wasted around 2 months for nothing.
---
He had purposefully followed me around waiting till I had casted SWP for a while before I did that. I was standing my ground.
---
How do you get your action bars to look Ike that? Looks super clean
---
Prot for “progression raiding” lol have you ever played vanilla? It’s not better for dungeons by virtue of doing zero damage - you go fury for the DPS. 
---
Jesus Christ both are horrible for PvP so why even bother.
---
Give it a month not tuesday lol
---
You may be taking a video game too seriously then.
---
If you're an Orc, Spinal Reaper from Rag is #1 for current content. Good luck convincing any warrs that you should get it over them. Hand of Debt is the next logical choice, if you enjoy suffering while farming 2500g worth of arcanite and hoping your guild gets lucky with ingot drops. HWL axe/mace are better, but there won't be any R14 people for at least a couple more months, and that grind is worse than farming Sulfuron Hammer mats.
---
I think what I'm trying to say is, although The Unstoppable Force from AV isn't the *best* weapon, it's by far the most attainable.
---
Pretty sure I put a disclaimer on it.
---
Probably hunter for DM tribute runs. 150+ gold per hour is pretty significant.
---
I would assume at some point the following might exist:
---
* Appearance change
---
* Name change
---
* Faction change (this one's pretty doubtful)
---
I’m Horde on Grobb and scared for the same thing. I like our balance. :/
---
I'm open to advice but I don't find it that easy. DC lasts for 3 seconds, WOTF lasts for 5. There's also some situations which I can think of that dictate using DC for survival over trying to counter WOTF specifically:
---
1. Frost mages with double ice block and blink trying to get in close range for nova spam and instants. In this situation, I'm primarily focused on using DC to gain distance on them so that they're forced to use casts which can be silenced by felhunter. Also if they open up with a blanket silence, you're kind of forced to use DC immediately after.
---
2. Warriors... they're going to pop berserker rage which lasts for 10 seconds so the only chance I have of getting a fear off is by chaining it with DC.
---
Just look at every single private server ever released in the history of ever. They are all based on 1.12 because that's what the players asked for.
---
Not at all my point, but thanks for your insight.
---
Those realms will be completely dead now. Idk if that’s better or worse for the game
---
Not for Herod. All classes are pretty well represented. Sure the p2 prebg weekly brackets were straight rogues and mages but not this week.
---
lol, you won't, I HATE fighting pallys as a rogue and it's like the only class I avoid if I can, plate + those flash heals + bubbles makes for a frustrating fight at best.
---
All joking aside, glad you're having fun. I'll probably at least roll an ally alt for the trip through Westfall/Redridge/Duskwood - hands down my favorite questing experience in the game.
---
Thank you! I hate having a cluttered screen. All I did was download the bartender add on, then disable the blizzard art bar!
---
Desolace.
---
Sure, but the data speaks for itself. People flock to servers where their faction dominates. The revealed preference is undeniable.
---
jesus christ you're fucking stupid
---
You cant login to them both at the same time though if they are linked so its probably a competely different account
---
Everytime I see this texture problem, it’s with a Mac user. Also, it seems to always be the paladin mount. About half the time I log in for the first time, not all of my tool tips are loaded. If I log out of the character and back in, the textures are all loaded.
---
This started occurring about 2 months ago after a WoW update. 
---
I also remember his same issue happening during TBC, but it was not nearly as frequently, and it almost always affected the paladin mount. Never the actionbar icons.
---
It is not
---
same thing happened to me going into rank 8
---
PVE to PVP was the restricted one iirc.
---
Probably not
---
Apparently you can't transfer to full servers from what I hear.
---
It's a dick move for a dick move.  I always invite people to group, specifically if it looks like they're on a kill x quest, or whatever.  However...
---
There may be a reason why the multiboxer doesn't want the person in group.  Maybe they did something shitty, maybe they were abusive; maybe they decided to go full 4chan in barrens chat one day...
---
If there's a line, you don't have to be a dick yourself about it.  That just makes two potential assholes instead of one.
---
Ahh you've discovered the secret.
---
The whole world is full of them.  Academics, athletes, C-levels.
---
I play on Bloodsail Buccaneers but word of how terrible Sulfuras has even reached us
---
you keep it.
---
Nice, as long as you’re not &lt;Final Boss&gt; trash then we can be friends.
---
Same with mages. +hit boots and gloves for the 2 set heavily outweighs any other options currently available
---
Menu items are all bound and gold on your bag frame and not necessary to see all the time.
---
Can you transfer between accounts? Or only server change?
---
We live in the age of twitch tryhards who can play for 16 hours a day and people have become used to the idea that this is how you're supposed to play games. So when you have 15 years of data showing that one faction is better than the other, combined with the nochanges crew, you get massive faction imbalance right off the bat. Doesn't really matter, though. Even if there were occasional changes like in retail you'd still see an eventual shift towards single faction realms just like in retail.
---
They could have used faction specific queues, and they could have atleast shown faction % on realms so people knew how it looked like when they picked servers instead of having to rely on discord polls
---
Eh, I don't really feel like "LFG" if I can just queue up. Something, something, not social.
---
My choice, sure. But then for the first week or two the strat to rush to Drek worked flawlessly. Now people are trying to change it up because "more honor". But then lose after almost an hour-long match.
---
...then complain we lost because "people didn't listen". - No shit. People NEVER listen unless the proverbial gun is at their head. Be that with a job, and the threat of termination. School and the threat of bad grades or detention. Or just life in general with laws.
---
So, with that in mind, why change up the meta.
---
[One week ago btw](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-1-13-3-patch-notes/384542)
---
Is it $25 per character or does the transfer apply to all selected toons?
---
We are loot council - but also have been asked our preference on 1H/OH vs. 2H so that can inform the decision of the council.  Honestly I'll be happy with any but just trying to make sure if asked I have an opinion on my preference. 
---
I also am not looking forward to completing the AV rep grind since I am only just now a few thousand into Revered.  I'll do it anyways but if I get SoD I can take my time a bit more as it won't be urgent.

I wish people would stop bringing this up as some kind of argument, it's not like Blizzard is going stop the release of AQ over faction imbalance

I was  already about 40% into rank 5 last week ...
---
PVP is the reason to use an off hand.  I don't know what you play but the number of off hands that have some unique use is insurmountable.  You can even use a spell stone which is specific to warlocks and gives a huge advantage versus mages and priests.
---
Balance doesn't even matter anymore. Wpvp is basically dead.
---
That's only the planned maintenance.  Both this week and last week we were able to log in hours before it was planned to be back up.
---
If you are farming honor strictly through HK farming, which is exactly what a 30 hour AV is, you will earn more honor ganking low level players in Un'goro / WPL / EPL than you will in AV.
---
I didnt say anything about progression raiding. I think you think that I am the same person as the other messages above.   
---
Your dps as a tank in a dungeon really doesn't matter much at all. You aren't significantly speeding up the run with the small boost in DPS you get from fury prot. Pretty garbage reason to be fury prot.  
---
Deep prot is great in PvP compared to fury prot. Night and day difference. I don't think you know much about PvP if you are arguing this point. Fury prot is TERRIBLE in PvP.
---
How else are they always going to come out on top?
---
It depends highly on what you are doing.  Higher raw stats of int/stam will benefit in lower dps scenarios and places where the added buffers are huge helps.  PvP, grinding, and certain fights will make higher pools more advantageous that another 34 spell power.
---
If you do any pvp, you want as much stamina as you can get without gimping your other stats.  Sometimes the blue staff from AV with +25 stamina might be better than the much higher dps weapon from MC.  Look at what you are dying to and see if the added HP buffer would benefit.  If a rogue is able to 100-0 you in a combo, would having more stamina allow you to survive and deathcoil?  Would having more health allow you to keep throwing dots around instead of dying quick to the enemy team in AV?
---
The specialty offhand items are great but they lack raw stats and have long cooldowns.  What are you going to use in between activations?  What are you going to use in fights that the items would have zero benefit?  Skull isn't going to help against a warrior, priest, druid, warlock, or shaman.

You dont need a debuff slot available. I havent checked for lobo but i did check for gutgore before i got perds. I assume lobo debuff=gutgore debuff prio. You can check on wc logs or record to confirm the debuff will never land no matter how many times it procs. We have 16 spots reserved and they never fell off. As for dd vs lobo, you'd nees to use spreadsheet I linked depending on gear you have available.

In space, no one can hear you scream, except for the other people on comms with you

Wow someone’s sensitive today
---
They had to wait for everyone to fill up all 8 of their alt banks to maximize their transfer $
---
Yeah, was actually just discussing that with a couple friends. $25 is well worth it imo.
---
So Horde is going to leave Horde dominated PVP servers to go to...Horde dominated PVP servers?
---
80/20 servers will transform into 95/5 server. Blizzard destroyed faction balance with free transfers. Pretty soon all realms will be PVE. GG...

Looks like general information about transfers for both versions of the game.

Just checked. No 🙁

It was there relatively early on, though maybe not at the very start. Possibly the bells from the winter festival were the first? Anyway, they've added more and more instruments over the years.

Community rallies, massive transfers into Flamelash to fight the Horde...in 2 weeks time, alliance are occupying Horde cities and Flamelash becomes the #1 dominated alliance server.  BOOK IT.
---
I'm completely expecting character re-customize to come, it's the lowest impact paid service they can add, it won't change anything. Boosts though, sure hope those are never coming.
---
character and faction changes have always been 2 separate charges. all your doing is changing your classic realm,nothing more nothing less
---
Source? There were a million no changes threads prior to launch. Surely you can find links of all these supposed demands for 1.12 only.
---
I only 2 Box with my 60 main and my alt, but had to speak out about the flip side of this. I’ve had VERY toxic interactions with people feeling entitled to my help. Kill quest? Of course I’ll invite. Escort? Sure. But gathering quests? It’s literally double the time if I invite you. Yet you wouldn’t believe the amount of “fucking loser” “pos” comments I get when I say no.
---
Wrong prio‘s i think
---
It will matter for AQ. Not just the gates opening either. Silithus will only be playable for the dominant faction on certain realms and will completely restrict access for the minority faction trying to get cenarion rep. Take all of the WPVP and put it in one zone with inflated population caps.
---
Blizz is going to make a killing and servers will now become ridiculously one sided.
---
i have epic mounts on both my chars so i have done my share of farming on both a shaman main (instant cast tag like druid) and warlock alt (dots), so have experienced both sides. yes, when you are competing for fresh spawns its pretty much fair game but not all spots are always camped like that at least on my server.
---
the person you were responding to had a druid follow them around and moonfire as soon as he cast SW:P on a mob to steal it which is different than your assumption of it being competing for a spawn.
---
SpeedyAutoLoot is the fastest. It stops the loot window from loading and instead loots the item before the interface performs a query for item information. Every other speed loot addon is slower.
---
Well fair enough then. I see that I was wrong in my interpretation of your initial comment.
---
Yeah man I'm the same attitude, I love me some AB but I'm not hardcore in to my PvP. Lets see what happens!
---
&gt;Isn't selling mageweave on ah more profitable?
---
83.5silver per stack is the break even. Then you have the AH % cut and the risk of losing your deposit. Better to just craft bandages 1000 at a time.
---
I love how many people are complaining about how this will make servers super 1 sided
---
I'm sure some servers will notice a difference, especially if entire guilds move for pvp reasons, but I think those cases are very rare. Remember, this is a paid service and a lot of people are pretty well set in their guilds and playing with friends. 
---
I expect this to bring back players that had quit as they can now come play with their friends after they hastily changed servers on launch day to get past those first week queues.
---
We'll see how this comment ages

Indeed. They didn’t want people to level on PVE to transfer to PVP. Wouldn’t be fair.
---
Asking the real questions. Daddy wants to stock up on flasks
---
I'm pretty sure it's because they added character xfers, not to calculate rank.
---
I have been using this macro while leveling for some time but I  noticed when my slam doesn't connect via miss, dodge, parry, the auto attack at the end of the sequence fails to go off. Is this just how it is?
---
Any idea what guilds from Skeram?
---
Stay away from Grobbulus. That server condones vile behavior
---
I highly doubt they will do faction change since it would be way too messy for shams and pallies.
---
I find it so shit how things like this and roof camping are bannable when they're mechanically possible. Why draw the line there? My friend and I had more fun poly chaining people wasting their time than actually killing them in P1, heaps of shit can be exploited like this and the solution is banning? kek
---
You're one to talk about where other people post lmao, your top post is at The_Donald.

Thank you. I will always be Horde at heart, it's just that this is a new experience to me and I'm really enjoying the game again. Level your toon past Duskwood and who knows, maybe you'll stick with him.

Yeah - was originally asking because we are loot council and they want to know our preference between 2H and 1H/OH to help inform their decisions when loot drops.

Will anybody look up to you and go ‘oh hey that’s super cool’ or would people just go ‘oh hey that’s someone with way too much free time who can do the most trivial task 15 hours a day every day?’

I mean....what's the difference?  Knowing that someone grinded 15 hours a day every day can be kind of cool right?

To get to the heart of the question: Is Grand Marshal/High Warlord inherently cool, or is it only cool because of how hard it is to get (and therefore how many straight days of 15-hour grinding it takes)?
---
"You see I'm playing both sides that way I always come out on top"
---
90 days

/shrug
---
&gt;• If you got fewer rank points than you should have, we’ll increase your amount up to where you should be. 
---
&gt;• If you got more than you should have, we won’t change your amount.
---
That doesn't sound like a display error.
---
How were players supposed to know faction ratios when Blizzard told us nothing and literally broke the only tool we had to get that information (census)?
---
Everyone knew balance would be an issue and Blizzard did nothing to address it. Then they added free transfers and made the instance twice as bad.
---
I'd say they deserve a pretty big share of the blame, if not all of it.
---
Yes idk if they want to broadcast that out yet.  They confirmed on the ally only Guild Master discord.  Our GM informed our officer core so we can make an informed decision.
---
Which is essentially the same thing when it comes to most game companies.
---
I agree that Alliance will get some queues as well. However, because of the significantly larger Horde populations on most servers, i believe the Alliance queues will never be as long as Horde queues become.
---
Sounds perfect
---
Im currently rank 10 on what could be considered a "casual server" and I still play a stupid amount even with us having bracket stacking established.
---
Leveling a rogue right now. Excited as shit to stalk people like this lol
---
&gt;What’s the best way to run Scarlet Monastery?
---
There are four wings, Graveyard (about lvl30~), Library (32-35~), Armory (37-39~), Cathedral (38-42~) that are all quite short so ideally you just want to do what has the best loot/XP available for you.
---
&gt;I’ve been told there’s a quest I can get from the SW cathedral at 34 that has a good weapon as a reward. Any tips? Thanks!
---
The quest you want is "In the Name of the Light": https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=1053/in-the-name-of-the-light
---
You will need complete this quest in Desolace before you can obtain it:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=1052/down-the-scarlet-path
---
Honestly this is a situation where all possible solutions are going to Garner allot of anger. 
---
My proposal to have separate ques for RP, PvE, and PvP realms ,and you can only have people from your realm on your team would make me happy while upsetting others. 
---
Also I despise the rush boss meta that was developed for efficiency. The obsessing with efficiency also ruined Korrak's revenge
---
I thought you couldn’t faction change in classic?
---
there is no point, he's just taunting the horde pvpers for the lulz
---
we bring 9 warriors the dps is way to high to not bring them
---
I have one of everything apart from druid, and four priests. Priest was my "thing" back in the day so I'm really trying to branch out, but one of them has still ended up being my highest level (only 37). The next in line level-wise is my shaman but honestly I'm not enjoying him at all so not sure if he'll make it to 60.
---
Warlock is fun, rogue is fun, mage is fun, hunter is *really* fun....but I just keep rolling new priests. Might be time to accept my fate.
---
Its ok tho, i wanna go for Rank 13, but there is no way im gonna do the hard push before the holidays
---
if i pressed it from the start i MIGHT of hit 10 by Xmas week...
---
but the decay would of caught me as with 2 kids and a sizeable family, that week is BOOKED hahah - id hate to downrank during that time
---
figured id hold it out at rank 8ish until after holidays are over... then make the push
---
This system is so fucking stupid
---
For PVE, the pants aren't bad, they sim about equal to Skyshroud.  Not a horrible stand if for extra stam until you get Nemesis pants.  Bracers are not horrible if you need some more survivability even if a +20 BOE is better DPS.  Rest of the pieces are kinda garbo compared to pre-BIS, though, and probably not worth consideration unless you missed pre-BIS and can't be bothered. 
---
At least it is good for PVP for warlocks.  Some of the other tier sets just suck full stop.  Warlocks get an absolute boat load of stam on T1.
---
No. Very popular private servers, such as Light's Hope, progressed through the patches. This is fairly typical for pservers. 
---
Source: I played on Light's Hope.
---
Like I said, "and processing." They miscounted, they still have the data. Do you think they just made up numbers for the updated results?
---
The WoW Forums are filled with so much salt I love it.
---
that's a shame.  took me a whole 5 minutes to solve OP's problem when I first saw the stones.  Took me a second to say to myself "hey I wonder when I should turn these in".
---
But if people want to complain, point fingers at the players, and have zero critical thought, cool!
---
That you make bad assumptions when someone says there's any choice other than min maxing?
---
Exactly.
---
Blue happy.
---
Red mad.
---
You can, just type /pvp and you will be flagged as if you were on a pvp server
---
Wow what a classic multi boxer, didnt even read his disclaimer.
---
“If you also selected a faction change”
---
Lol welp
---
I just hope theres limits, like if the server you want to is 80/20 you cant transfer to the 80 side.
---
It is, but people act like the mobs in an area are THEIRS and touching one of them so you can do a quest is like stealing the gold out of their bags. I get that you need to make money... maybe group with me and you'll still get half of it, I get my quest items, and I leave the area sooner?
---
I like turtles
---
You should probably try playing again if you haven't in the last week. BGs have really changed the game and there aren't 24/7 roaming gank squads out and about anymore. Personally, I was spending 12 hours a day roaming the higher level zones searching for kills before BGs, but I haven't left a capital since BGs dropped except to go raid.
---
&gt;I ended up around 50 games won, and lost about 22-25 as alliance.
---
Is that starting at neutral or revered?
---
If revered, then there's a huge disparity in our total games to get exalted. I'm thinking you started at neutral, right?
---
You pretty much nailed it, but I’ll add a couple things. 
---
The ability to offheal is amazing when there’s no dedicated healer around, or not enough healers. Two holy lights can massively swing a group fight in your favor. 
---
BoPing a priest or Druid healer is also incredibly useful. 
---
Being able to dps through divine shield is huge. This can either help you defend a flag or finish off an enemy player in many cases where you would otherwise die.
---
No, they did not.
---
When did LH do all of the talent tree updates then? Because I had 1.12 tallents through the entire game. Weird.
---
They don't want people lvling in a pve server then transfer to pvp server. That's just ez mode right there.
---
If you think that mages offer was reasonable in even the SLIGHTEST way, I hope you stub your toe everyday for all of time
---
Phase 1 is 3 minutes long. If Rag goes into phase 2 it's usually due to lower dps. First thing to do is to check the gears of your raid team members. They need to keep collecting pre-raid BiS for whatever stat that can boost their damage output. 
---
DPS also need to survive long enough throughout the fight, this means using GFPP, popping survival ability cooldowns, and bandaging themselves then their health get low. Melee DPS need to know when to run out of melee range to avoid Wrath of Ragnaros. Ranged dps need to spread out to avoid knocking multiple players away when they are hit by Hand of Ragnaros (which knocks players airborne if they are with 10-12 yards of the person being hit). Unlike melee DPS, tanks should never run out of melee range of Ragnaros. If the current tank is knocked away by Wrath of Ragnaros then the off-tank needs to run in immediately. Otherwise Ragnaros will start casting Magma Blast on players outside melee range and instantly kill them with 6000 damage. Whenever I've encountered Ragnaros submerging it's because most of our melee dps and half of our casters are dead through the first 3 minutes.
---
If you have DBM installed, it will have a timer for how long until Ragnaros submerges. If Rag has more than 50% health at the 1:30 mark then your RL needs to make the call to prepare for a submerge instead of hoping your raid dps will magically go up for the remaining 1min30s (they usually don't because people will be dying). 
---
When there is 10 seconds before submerge DBM will add another timer in the middle of the screen. Players farther away from the collapse spot need to start running at the 10 seconds mark and the rest should start running at the 5 seconds mark. Practice this collapse a few times before you start the boss fight.
---
Once most of the Sons have reached towards the collapse spot, have your mages pop frost nova. Work out an order for it to avoid having all mages use frost nova at the same time. Once the first nova is out, everyone in the vincinity needs to run away because the Sons have an aura that drains mana. Mages can then start using blizzard to AOE down the mobs (which means at least 1 mage in raid needs to have improved blizzard). Save at least 1-2 mana replenishing items for this phase in case your mana gets drained. *It's very important to run in the same direction* if someone has aggro from the Sons. If they scatter then it will be a wipe as the Sons will slowly pick off players one by one.
---
Phase 2 is survivable if you keep trying a few times using what I've described above, but it's overall a suboptimal strategy and only suitable for your very first (and maybe second) Rag kill because at least 1/3 to 1/2 of the raid will be dead by the time he re-emerges.
---
There never was.
---
We had a 30+ Hour AV on Kargath back in Vanilla.
---
Supposedly if you do it you get an error and the transfer doesn’t go through.... so don’t mean to be the one you might’ve shot yourself in the foot but....
---
Like i said people shouldn’t be so protective, attack mobs for quests is fine, but people should be courteous is all if they are there to aoe farm, and someone is already established
---
And yet all of that data existed on private servers.
---
Meh, I hope the game dies quickly at this point.
---
not min/max, just max
---
The difference between vanilla is that the guys back then somewhat put their soul and enjoyment into the game. Now it's just a suit telling them what to do.
---
You sir are someone who appreciates landscape and detail, as well as me. IF and SW are awesomely detailed and laid out, I now have time to explore places I have never been before. It's really been an enjoyable experience for me. Thank you for putting in your comment and time, much appreciated!
---
even a broken clock is right twice a day
---
everyone thinks he's a gold farmer
---
I recommend maintaining 2 sets of gear. A plate set for soloing and the cloth stuff for dungeon and raid healing. I think my dude looks super bad ass right now with T1 pieces, ironslag shoulders, T2 pants and helm.
---
Yes, no more leaders changing it to master loot.
---
I'm worried that arenas would lead to the entire pvp meta game becoming insanely broken and blizzard almost being forced to nerf/buff classes because the game really really really isn't built around 2v2/3v3 and some specs like SL warlock, reckoning paladin, shadow priest etc. would just completely break the arena system and lead to certain specs (or the druid class) basically having no chance of climbing at all because all druids are truly good at in classic pvp is running away.
---
People did crazy things to avoid those 8 hours long queues. I hit level 24-25 on two different paladins until I rerolled again on a server, which eventually ended being the worst choice.
---
I had two big concerns with Classic:
---
* My pick of class is extremely important, but at least I kinda knew what I was getting into.
---
* The pick of ream is almost as important as the class choice, but you basically have no information besides some surveys done here.
---
(I failed both)
---
Hey guys, for both Horde and Alliance, Whitemane is a great server. Please transfer here because I want to keep the balance healthy.
---
&gt; which take 5 minutes
---
What to do with the remaining 45min? XD
---
((Seriously, why does it take the Horde so much longer to kill Van. I check the map and there's no ally that ported back or there's just a couple. They drawing it out to farm honor???))
---
Ya, balanced realm are about to become shitshow and the unbalanced one are about to become single faction PvE-like realm. Can't be mad at blizzard thought, how could they have predicted the effect of transfers would have on the servers health. ... Wait.
---
So the unbalanced PvP servers will become single-faction PvE servers. GG
---
Naw.. the old guys are the ones that have lived it and know better.
---
Yes, as of today. Check the front of the sub.
---
Ohh I thought you meant they did 1/15th of his hp wow I feel dumb.
---
CoA not allowed on single target fights and we only allot corruption for SM/Ruin. I'm honestly just wanting to drop my assignment so I can stand at max range and pump shadowbolts.
---
&gt; maybe item shop and insta 60 boost.
---
Please do not give them ideas...
---
“Paid server transfers”
---
I mean if you are farming in the fields over the tightly packed areas, it definitely sucks if another mage is in your area.  3g to have it all to yourself seems reasonable, otherwise you both suffer...
---
Same but it’s you and you’re reading the words I write.  Eat some o that sonic.
---
TIL most adults make thirty bucks an hour
---
I'm not sure it was a mistake... I think the servers split at one point between East and West coast. I don't remember there being a choice when I started playing back in August. I only discovered that I was EST on a West Coast server after I was already 60 in full pre-bis. 
---
I could be wrong though and maybe rushed to create my character.
---
If I had to guess if they ever did offer faction transfer it would be with TBC (assuming they decide to do a classic tbc)
---
Are we able to transfer from a PVE to an RP-PVP server?
---
Because he/she ninjaed the thunderfury binding and gets a lot of crap in general about it and now wants to hide.
---
Like hell I would buff you and get aggro from all those mobs.
---
Why? If they let it get unbalanced, then they can charge you again to move again.
---
PROFIT!
---
Nah, people consented to a PVP server, it wasn’t rape.
---
Deadmines was a rollercoaster for me between 17-22. I came across a lot of different challenges I never would have had while on a Horde toon. Though I'm face mashing my keyboard because of another player, I'm still enjoying it. Lol
---
Westfall Horde feels about like how original Vanilla felt on an alliance heavy server to me (I played Ner'zhul alliance in Vanilla). We don't get the instant groups for everything like other servers, but it's not that challenging to put something together. My guild has 2 raid teams full clearing MC and we've gotten every Azuregos kill on the server save 1 (plus a bit under half the Kazzak kills). The faction imbalance isn't much of an issue at end game, but you will be hard pressed to find groups for the obscure dungeons while leveling.
---
Yeah it might not be a bad idea to see if they can let you know where you stand on prio for both items to help make the decision.
---
That is how it worked in the past.  We will have to see.
---
Ah yes, the good ol' "but blizzard is rich with super monies and super technologies so how come they're not always perfect at everything?" idea. News flash, Blizzard isn't exactly amazing (in case you didn't already know that somehow). Lots of easy-to-find info about there on why they used the 1.12 client, and no it's not because they schemed to give us a shit AV from the start.
---
You'd certainly get at least a few ranks at an hour per day. Lower ranks have fairly low honor decay, so pretty much everyone is going to get to rank 3  or so unless they just refuse to pvp whatsoever. With good play and limited time, you could get at least a few ranks higher. You'd never do 10+, of course, but say, rank 6 or 7? Sure.
---
I know this is an old post, but Madseason and Asmon are the difference between positive reinforcement during parenting and spanking.
---
Jesus cry more
---
Delete toon.
---
Create new toon with same name.
---
Restore old toon.
---
I'm on Skeram and the place is pretty dead
---
And a little bit of doc
---
Fuck faction balance I guess.
---
So I realize it's all doom and gloom here, but keep in mind these aren't free transfers. The price will definitely make people reconsider moving. I don't think this is going to be as apocalyptic as everyone thinks.
---
At least I'm hoping 😬
---
2000G It is in the Blizz announcement they just released.
---
I never see my server name on this sub, I think they’re all in on keeping it a secret.
---
blizzard hasnt cared for faction balance since the game came out. if u thinnk they were going to care NOW even with the cenusu addons before they got broke you'd be a fool.
---
cydnarrus is 100% right,this is a player made problem,blizzard is banking on your choices now more then ever with paid server transfers.
---
Hey go post this on your official server forums and let me know how that goes down.
---
They should limit it so transfers to a realm with more than 60% of your faction is disabled. Maybe reduce cost if you transfer to one were its less than 40%.
---
Whatever means more money for blizzard lul
---
Tbh, u dont actually know so Idk Why i bother🤔its enjoyable tho
---
They’ve probably learned that people will pay $25 bucks, go to a one faction server, and keep playing.
---
Most retail PvP servers reached horrible balance with time, but notably, the big faction kept playing, AND they pocketed a transfer fee.
---
Soo getting information before I finalize a choice is shooting myself in the foot? Beg to differ...but k.
---
Sounds like one person made an impulse decision to find that out.
---
In b4 60 boost with BC.
---
He was seeing if he could get away with not having to come gank you. 
---
I hope he learnt not to be a lazy dumbass.
---
90 day cooldown.
---
Same man, but my premade did AB.  I forget exactly how quick it was, but we pretty much 5-cap won AB in like 8-10 minutes in 90% of my games.  Still didn't get R14 -- I burned out and my options were fail out of college (my turn to r14 lined up with finals week), or stop.   The grind got to me, and took a toll on my health. 16-18+ hours a day, barely taking time to eat, not moving, not working out, barely sleeping......  I quit.
---
Ah, master looting was quite 'toxic' indeed!
---
why the hell am i downvoted for literally reporting the server's population as they are ? What's next, downvote because i said the sky is blue ?
---
I don't know WvW enough to judge, even if its lack of popularity wouldn't surprise me, but Raiding has always been a minor thing in GW2, and there is no issue to find a spvp match ? 
---
and since when fucking spvp is the endgame ? It's basically the black duck of GW2. You can do it as soon as level 1, and most people in the endgame are farming in the open world areas, doing mercenary primes, events or fractals. That's where you'll find the GW2 population. Everywhere in the world.
---
Saying GW2 is dying when you'll see as many people in cities than in the capitals of most wow classic's servers is a bit far-fetched.
---
But hey, it's not like people already say constantly since 2012 that it's dying.
---
Short answer: there isn't one.
---
Long answer:
---
Google Classic WoW Census. Those sites rely on user submitted information so are subject to error.
---
Another source is a site where guilds log their raid clears (I don't have the link). But again that's user submitted information and only reflective of the top end of the population.
---
Actually I use shift+scroll wheel for pet. I still use just scroll wheel for zooming in and out.
---
Because no one gives a fuck about a dead ass spreadsheet simulator
---
Same but as a healer. Rolled to resto on my druid and I'm not sure how to deal damage at all anymore. I'll gladly heal the other guy that does, though.
---
This problem only exists because they opened server transfers to begin with. Server factions were decently balanced at launch.
---
thanks.
---
cant read those at work
---
This is kind of huge.  I haven't found a guild that I really like and am considering moving.  I would feel bad leaving them and all, but might have to do it.
---
Yeah one of the Guilds that had a bunch of R13s pushing R14 on Mal'Ganis were pretty bad PvE.  They just premade and grinded BGs
---
Oh boy you got me, I’m a racist, oh no I suddenly feel awful about my political views and will immediately change all of my views to satisfy you lest you label me a racist again.  
---
Literally get fucked.
---
Yes, it is surprisingly common. I had a rogue pop out of stealth and wave at me while I was killing a mob when I was below 50% HP AKA free honor.
---
A minute later I get a whisper "I love your name. I'm that rogue. I almost killed you until I saw the name and laughed." 
---
We chatted for a bit and then he went back on his Ally toon.
---
Keep in mind that your raid leader might get annoyed by the Lobo's debuff.  Not sure if it applies to raid bosses, but just FYI.
---
Horde want to turtle games as long as possible now because of queues
---
Most of my games are taking at least 30 minutes. It sucks especially that I couldn't play the first weekend so missed out
---
Yeah I’m having such a fun time, but this sounds...   bad. Luckily Monster Hunter: Iceborne comes out in January, so I’ll have a new grinding game!
---
Same on the Whitemane Horde, outside of BRM. I was casually questing in EPL and nobody messed with me.
---
Thank you for going along with what people actually want and keeping the daily thread. It's very clearly very popular!
---
Haha good one
---
not everyone went on a pvp server to pvp,u went to play with friends or a raiding guild,to say people consented is down right idiotic,because u had no choice no matter what u say. if u wanted to play with that hardcore raiding guild on a pvp server it was transfer or bust,there was no other option.
---
personally speaking its going to be entertaining in the days to come now with paid server transfers to see how this all plays out,especally since to my knowledge its no restrictions for classic.
---
Doesn't the system incentivize collusion?  Otherwise it's pretty much a competition of whose more unemployed with free time
---
This sucks actually.
---
Name and rep used to mean something. Not anymore!
---
This. Capped 2 toons by day 60 and now I just raid log. Lol.
---
I got exalted and knew to save my stones but I used the last of my stones to get exalted.
---
So I had convince someone friends to run scholo with me one last time and pass me all the stones so I could get my new shoulder Chant.
---
Also I rushed the rep because I wanted the tabard...rip.
---
&gt; only one racist guild *cough ssd pug*
---
You forgot &lt;UNBRIDLED ANIMUS&gt;
---
Ya that's around 60k a year which is pretty close to the average salary
---
id the fights lasted any amount of time you would be oom, but with the sub 1 minute kill times on MC bosses your fine blowing your bar immediately.
---
I should say that was just my leveling experience. I never personally found the VW to be very useful past 20.  Sometimes with really hard pulls, or multi mob pulls. But he can barely hold threat if you are doing any kind of real damage to a mob.
---
The bubble-sac is amazing though.
---
RoV is so good that every Warlock should probably roll tailor for it regardless, but the non-tailors should be getting Robe of the Winter Night.  Felheart Robes are pretty poor for PVE. 
---
1% hit, depending on gear, is only worth a dozen or so spellpower (just slightly more than 1% crit).  If you are otherwise fully raid geared (Mageblade, Tome of Shadow Force, TOEP, Nemesis 2/2, etc) that 1% hit might be worth slightly more, like 15-16 maybe, but never remotely close to the ~30 spellpower deficit Felheart Robe has compared to RoV or RoWN. 
---
RoVP will be better than all of those if you have ~350+ spellpower in good pre-BIS form, and scales well once you start hitting 450+ in full raid BIS.
---
Sure dude let's ignore that the cancerous community of most PVP realms brought this upon themselves with their toxic behaviour. It's all BLUZZRDS fault apparently.
---
&gt;Characters cannot transfer from PvE realms to PvP Realms and RP realms cannot transfer to RP-PvP realms.
---
Yup, that's exactly what happened to me. I don't think I even bothered changing the clock settings until I was trying to find a guild and they posted their raid schedule in server time.
---
I guess that depends on the server population, but I’m not willing to try and get even close haha
---
you don't actually HAVE to do all these things by the way! most of these raids are optional after a point.
---
people are misinterpreting this post but it's too late; this was more to show that current raidloggers upset about the state of the game being boring just have to wait, more content that will occupy all their time if they so choose for it to is coming. PLENTY of guilds will just be running one or two raids a week, or if they're running multiple will have different rosters. don't worry about it!
---
Step right up!
---
A previous supervisor once told me a quote, "Your attitude, not aptitude, determines your altitude" You can be the best at what you do but if you have a shit attitude no one wants to work with you. I would take an average joe that listens, can take constructive criticism, and is a team player over some highly skilled asshole who causes drama any day.
---
Made that mistake only once on my shaman. 
---
“Oh crap that Druid is about to die, I should help out!”
---
We both ended up with a long walk back.
---
Sabotaging open world bosses is a thing sometimes. But really most high end content can be instanced so it's not that big of a problem, plus the wonky times world bosses even spawn in anyways.
---
Haha I’ve saved every single one. Feels good.
---
Is this a guess or you know for sure?
---
thanks!
---
Yup, and in such small numbers, the recalling alliance players do virtually no good whatsoever.  I was starting to feel bad for this one druid last night who kept recalling again and again and again and never made it more than 20 feet before he died.  If the 4-5 of the actually coordinated and waited a couple of minutes and recalled together, they might have caught us with our proverbial pants down in Vann's room.  Didn't happen though.
---
This is pretty standard as far as things go. It's the same deal with the Timbermaw, you need to save your headdress feathers for when the mobs stop giving XP.
---
I mean yeah, it's really annoying the game doesn't tell you this, but if you ever looked up a rep guide for the faction this would be plastered all over every page. I'd hate to have been one of the first people to figure this out.
---
You were downvoted but are honestly speaking truth.
---
Paladins have no competition for buffs, and priest buffs are better too imo.
---
Yeah like... obviously every time I get an in game token I instantly start analyzing and considering optimal times to turn them in their effectiveness .... people are delirious if they think that’s how normal people consume information.
---
That is way higher than the median individual income in United States. The census has it at 31k a year. So half as much.
---
Every time you call somebody bald one of your own hair follicles dies. Keep it up cueball.
---
Nope, got a 48 Druid (spotted playing once P2 came out) 44 Warlock, 26 Warrior, 24 Mage, and a 19 Priest. I'm thinking about getting either my Druid or Warlock to 60, but I also kinda want to make a Hunter or Rogue.
---
My greatest dream in this game is that one day someone will recognize my name. But it's a relatively minor character from the Silmarillion so it's not super likely.
---
Hell yeah brother, it's a good cape.
---
Had a tank try and force us to kick him so he wouldn't get the deserter debuff leaving a dungeon he didn't like.
---
Convinced the rest of the group to grab some lunch and do some RL stuff making sure they kept their characters logged in.
---
I think he spent 30 minutes writing angry messages to a group of afk players before accepting his fate.
---
&gt; Characters cannot transfer from PvE realms to PvP Realms

Currently looking for a good Alliance US PVP Pacific server if anyone has any recommendations.
---
I had similar story, but I could not tell my plan. A red dude of my level came to farm my place. Since I am bad at pvp he killed me when it became obvious that mobs are not enough for two. Then I logged my L60 rogue and killed his lowbie. Then he logged his hunter to counter my rogue. Then I stopped trying to interact with his hunter and just stayed cloaked until he logged back to lowbie alt. We played this game few hours then he left.
---
So instead of moving to another place we both lost hours of progression. That was my biggest mistake.
---
Theres a reason why I am upvoted and you are downvoted. 
---
You misinterpreted the question and acted like a total douch to the asker. His question was very clear to everyone except you. So you not only look like an idiot who lacks reading comprehension but also an asshole for harassing the person who asked. 
---
Imagine being this ignorant.
---
I played on Faerlina US from the UK on garbage internet and its been okay. Got about 110 ping.

Have a centralized meeting location , have a solid challenging shout and aoe them all down, back before we beat submerged timer we’d have a warlock banish just one so people could bandage and regenerate some before rag came back, if you keep one banished he won’t return until timer ticks down, but if you kill them all he returns instantly
---
You can't go PVE -&gt; PVP. Though you can select the server, you'll get an error when you try to finalize it.
---
If EU then Flamelash
---
&gt; Team 1 Team 2, A-team, B-team...its all the same.
---
Nothing in that implies that Team 1 has more skill than Team 2 as you implied, only that the teams worked on different projects. There's also no mention of interns anywhere in that article.
---
Literally saw this happen to my wife in AV, she had 2 horde attacking, priest rolls up, and she's like YEAH can win this! Priest proceeds to start spamming smite, doesn't heal her, or shield nothing.  They both die...I looked at her and said "Its not really the faction imbalance that has alliance beat, its 400IQ players like that guy."
---
Do you not understand how confusing you are? Here’s what you just said. 
---
“The question actually asks if I should use BSH in my offhand, or AotDW.” YOU ARE ASKING ABOUT YOUR OFFHAND WEAPON AND WHICH ONE TO USE!!!! How the heck do you not see how poorly your question is written?
---
On my druid I gave everyon I passed mark. There is not a single character in the game who doesn't want Mark of the Wild outside of obscure situations. 99 times out of 100, a character will want mark. So I gave it freely to anyone I passed. Handed it out like candy on Halloween. Even gave melee classes thorns too.
---
Then I go and level a warlock and find the lack of buffs I can give to others, uh.... 'jarring' is the word I'll go with. But I still have this impulse, this fixation to give buffs to others and as it turns out, warlock has one! Endless breath. So, everyone I cross gets endless breath. Yes thats right, ten minutes of underwater breathing despite being landlocked because we're in Duskwood.
---
Is a faction change available with this?
---
It's almost like players to had make last minute decisions on where to play because Blizzard released far too few servers on launch and had to scramble to release more. But I'm sure that's not Blizzard's fault either, right?
---
&gt; mobs that aren’t there for quest items or kills.
---
this is definitely not the case for people who are leveling with aoe grinding. in fact a lot of the good spots have quests associated with them.
---

---
for aoe gold grinding your statement is true since its done in zulfarak, diremaul and blackrock depths.
---
Worse, I see this behavior even outside of the online world. People have realized they are effectively anonymous in crowds. So they play loud music on the bus, or that handheld video game in public. Same with driving, many people don’t care about politeness, just as long as they get theirs (see the amount of people stopping on onramps or missed turns and backing up). Or just straight shitty behavior. People are starting to increasingly take the troll/selfish online approach to real life interactions now. And it’s straight ugly.
---
I dont think I am going to hit rank 14, I work, have a wife and kid. Raiding and farming consumes takes enough time lol im just pvping for fun :)
---
Great, then they’ll be a geared tank without a raid spot. The raid spot is the problem, not the gear.
---
Because fuck you that’s why
---
I'm still using it at 41 lol.
---
Come all ye Horde brethren to Pagle! The alliance out number us....but no one cares cause its PVE!!
---
took me 10 days played and i have experience with wow
---
I believe rag will also target the ret pallys and blast them with his knock back like is done with ranged, which means any other melee will be blasted.
---
We have our one ret pally stand away from melee because this was happening.

Ironforge.pro isn't the best but it's all we got for a very rough estimate
---
there's a lot of people with the max rank trinket which has no cooldown on teleporting in front of drek's door. warlocks and priests teleporting in and fearing people is incredibly disrupting, and they can do it every 30 seconds over and over and over
---
ally don't do it because they're constantly told not to go north just go south and offense don't prolong the game (which was correct when that had a decent chance of working, but things are changing)
---
It's hard since not every opposite faction player is an asshole
---
Macro check please!  I copied this macro from a guide on Wowhead last week (I think that's where I got it):

It doesn't seem to work though, just posts that line in chat, most embarrassingly.  Is there a syntax error here?
---
ya we are 55/45 .. don't want all the alliance to leave :(
---
Why do you think this thread needs to exist when
---
&gt;https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ebzc85/paid_character_transfer_is_now_available/
---
is smack dab on the front page?
---
Just like retail? More like just like every era up until they stopped using the old server structure. 
---
Currently there basically are no servers in the traditional sense, for most purposes. Faction balance can be as good as they want it to be; it's just that the world is basically meaningless so it doesn't matter.
---
/hug
---
I honesty think anonymity as a shield has nearly always existed. It's just that people were younger and dumb kids rather than actively malicious for a lot of the older games. Also nowadays tons of people post stupid crap to like Facebook which is linked to their real name, forget about even reputation with a username.
---
i did want to grind for that AV ring so I had to grind for that
---
Does this include a race change when you transfer?
---
The prestige is the dedication it took to get there, in fact a lot of R14 people I have known are not good players at all, they didn't have to be, they just had to have no life and persevere to get R14.  You didn't even need gear for the entire grind.  It is actually funny how perspectives shift because I can totally see some young kid rolling up on a HWL/GM and being in awe of the weapons they have, but any half-witted adult knows that person is the crustiest virgin alive or had to manipulate in other ways to get it, like account sharing, which is morally ambiguous IMO as that's what it takes to hit the upper bracket so many weeks in a row.
---
I multibox and just spam dungeons.   I just wanted to avoid waiting for dungeons or any drama.
---
The game is great, it's Blizzard that sucks.
---
People were begging for this the last few weeks, but now everyone will act outraged.
---
If you have locks that do not have a curse assignment, but do have a slot, tell them to use curse of agony instead of corruption. It's more dps, even without amplify.
---
Imo a good tank can pretty much carry alliance AV in the current meta. If we could avoid scuffed drek pulls and have off tanks that are on point we could just cruise through and avoid a lot of the war masters.
---
The WoW gods have blessed you
---
Christ, you had to stretch so hard for this shit post. Theres no set limits for downtimes. Just like there's no set limits for kitchen mishaps and mess-ups. They happen when they happen and its reasonable to be pissed its 8 hours **now** when it wasn't **before**. Im not saying riot and rage or quit, its just really funny that there exists this culture of product loyalty so deep that any criticism or complaint is viewed as "entitlement". Its a little spineless.
---
Man that annoys the heck out of me when people are getting pissy in chat after giving 0 useful call outs or strategies. Like if you’re bein a good leader and people aren’t listening then fine, but 90% of the time people aren’t choosing to do poorly, they just don’t know what they need to do and flaming them in chat just makes everyone have less fun.
---
If leadership is lacking, step up or shut up but don’t just bitch. If we’re losing let’s have fun with it, underdog wins can happen, but killing morale doesn’t help.
---
Thankfully I haven’t seen that so much in classic, at least not like retail where I hope players are literal children cuz imagining adults behaving so childishly makes me sad.
---
correct, that change happened in late TBC or wrath
---
Imagine having a full time job, girlfriend, Christmas parties and graduations to go to. If only I could be a no-life like you.
---
no idea what you're talking about, my retail realm is almost 1:1 and my classic realm is like 55:45 a/h
---
My insides turn to celery as I release my warm and sticky cauliflower of love
---
I cant leave my current horde guild because I'd feel sad with how nice everyone has been to me. They dont need my main class for their core raiders but in terms of helping get items, dungeons, or just having friendly info it has been a great experience
---
My main is my Druid, because they’re great sugar daddies for gearing up alts due to stealth and almost no downtime. A fantastic farming class.
---
My two main alts are my rogue and warlock.
---
I'd rather have longer maintaince than scuffed honor calculations
---
the legs are not even worth it, you have eldritch legs from dm west available 
---
15str

vs the pvp legs of

---
the difference is truly negligible
---
though the set bonus is "nice" but it's still only a 20str buff and will likely cost you 1% hit from the boots you have(and boots also get replaced in bwl) 
---
the shoulders are also out done by the drake palon pauldrons bwl, lionheart beats all the helms from pvp
---
you need rank 12- rank 13 for actual good rewards otherwise shit just isn't worth it. Unless you just really enjoy the grind or the pvp part or whatever
---
On Mankrik, and queues last night were 12-13 minutes last night.  On Sunday night they were more like 10.  Last Tuesday/Wednesday, they were more like 4 minutes.  But last Tuesday/Wednesday, the games almost all ended in under 10 minutes and the Horde lost almost all of them.  Now, at least in my battle group, Horde wins the substantial majority of them but they are indeed significantly longer games.
---
Fuck you simply because of the "xD"
---
Oh shut uuuuuup with this shit over and over. We get it, you suck at the game and project that shit here. Go away
---
My main is 60. I want my rogue to be 60 also but now that my work has picked up more I've had mo time to play :(
---
Ok, I'll play. Loath though I am to defend Blizzard, sometimes they actually aren't wrong.
---
How do they incentivize faction balance? Because faction queues aren't the answer. That isn't incentivizing playing the other side, its just penalizing you for playing the overpopulated faction. So you've got a 3 hour queue for as Horde, what are your alternatives? 
---
For purposes of conversation, this applies to PvP realms because who gives a shit about faction balance on PvE realms?
---
1) Reroll Alliance and hope that after several days of playtime enough other Horde did the same so you dont zip right into the game just to get bodybagged by the faction imbalance that caused the faction queue.
---
2) Free transfer to a server where Horde are the minority, which is what, two NA realms? With the overall disparity, it won't take long to tip those servers and now this option is dead and you're back in queue. 
---
3) Quit because the queues are too fucking long.
---
The reason they've never done anything hands-on about imbalance is because there's no way to do it without creating even more problems. The only way to really fix the imbalance is balancing racials because that's what causes the issue. And yeah, I'm sure lots of people do genuinely like the Horde but I don't buy for a secone that faction population did a total 180 from Vanilla to Classic because of anything but smarter players minmaxing racials. And the time to balance that is long gone because even if they buffed Alliance racials, how many people will seriously reroll their geared up  and ranked up Horde 60s?
---
So please, I'd love to hear how you fix faction imbalance at this point without effectively punishing people or relying on average players making a massive time investment again. 
---
On another note, people are far too concerned with "server health". I've been around for a long time, I get the appeal. But people need to face the cold reality that server community died ages ago and Classic didn't bring it back. Maybe it exists on some smaller servers, but denying people the freedom to go to better environments or seek out more fitting guilds to protect the outliers is bad design.
---
On a serious note, alliance could use a little people. But the alliance on the server have a lot of good players.
---
This puts me more at ease about trying to get it. It looks like a huge stat boost, and I'm looking for something with a lot of stats for when I eventually heal dungeons. Thank you. You've cemented it for me to try for this weapon.
---
"pvp server sucks, let me off or i quit"
---
"omg transfers already? this is gonna kill the game"
---
blizzard (jackie chan wtf face)
---
Why would anyone choose to transfer to a server that's already 80% their faction?
---
I wonder what is the reason that you cannot transfer from PvE to PvP is. I thought it was to avoid people farming gold on PvE servers and moving it to PvP servers, but with the 2k gold cap, that cannot be the issue, so I don't really see why
---
/r/gatekeeping
---
I think if players were informed, and there was some policing on server balance by blizzard, I believe you would see many less unbalanced servers. You can definitely blame players for the mass migration from certain servers during the free transfer window (which could also be blamed on blizzard for letting them leave in the first place).
---
Is this a retail thing? The deserter debuff only applies to BGs in Classic. You're allowed to leave a dungeon whenever you want.
---
Alliance in the 60 bracket is lower than Horde. They could use a few more guilds. Overall the server is balance.
---
Lol the eye of sulfuras dissolved the largest guild on remulos due to drama and the ninja became a living meme
---
Here's the thing about BIS, if you just get the tier gear you are perfectly capable of clearing the next tier. Don't spend 10X the effort for 1% increases. Focus yourself in other areas.

You can heal 5mans as literally any spec, or even no spec at all (no points spent). I just wouldn’t advertise you’re a PI/SW spec, just come with healing gear and do that job. Some people might just be stupid enough to think you can’t heal as such a spec and refuse to invite you. But they are dumb, so you’ll have the satisfaction of knowing that.
---
All situational. All you have to do when the group starts is state what your main spec is, and verify it’s cool that you roll with that as your main spec. Even though you are healing or tanking said dungeon.
---
He wants to tank. Imagine that’s not the same as a dps warrior. If he wants to play a dps warrior that’s different
---
They should have waited a couple weeks for it to calm down like everyone said it would, and then did.
---
It sucks as much as you think it does 😂 I just regretted rolling an Orc so damn much
---
The MS ­&gt; OS rules applies to when you run group content, so I'm not sure what's your point with this comment.
---
As of last night, 10-15 minutes usually.
---
Awesome but not everyone wants to dps
---
So to you, playing the game is painful. Why play?
---
This has been a battle that I agree with. We have a low geared SM Lock who's corruption with nightfall is less dps than a more geared CoA, but they still give him a slow.
---
I havnt seen it either, whew. Whats the name so we know were talking about the same one?
---
Dude great input!
---
Uhm why does how many dps warriors they take have anything to do with anything? Dude wants to tank.
---
Yeah it's not ideal since the final boss is 37, but he's a pretty squishy caster and I'd say that getting to him is harder than the boss.
---
Be a tank a reserve scourgestones.
---
Did you know that it's a good idea to spend 5 seconds glancing at the front page to know if you're making a very obvious repost?
---
They allowed it back in Vanilla. It happened on Black Dragonflight. The best Guild on the server geared up on a PVE server.  Then their main raid group was banned by wall hacking Naxx.
---
Fair enough
---
&gt;*last minute decisions on where to play*
---
Said like that decision is set in stone and can’t be made again after the fact. C’mon...
---
Sheep will full heal the mob. Fear will not. BIG difference in the skills you're seemingly forgetting. One can easily be griefing. The other, not so much. Otherwise fear WOULD be against tos
---
Absolutely lovely sounding people, I would love to play with them! They seem like a hoot.
---
"well geared" is the name of the game. Im not a fan of these comparisons because of the early content gear imbalance. An all epic'd out T1 prot warrior will have a lot of raw str/attack power and will have decent output from their set alone and can get all epics. On the flip side for paladins, the early game, there really isn't an all epic set that they can get to other than +healing, only Field-Marshal/Marshal pvp gear. I know BWL is out sometime in the near future but Judgement isnt 100% Ret viable. Theres only a hand full of epics a Ret paladin can get from MC and such and I think to make a loose comparison argument is null and void. Biggest upgrade for any Ret Paladin comes back to the 2 hander they use for Seal of Command.
---
If you actually put in effort you can rank as solo warrior in world pvp. Many warriors are in top bracket.  Stop blaming your class for your lack of skill or effort. 
---
If your shit at world pvp and dont put in effort then yea pfc you wont rank up.
---
you sweet summer child
---
Merge alliance dominated and a horde dominated servers together.
---
This is why I play classic.  The opportunity for your actions to have a discernible affect on the world and other players.
---
Im not saying they would, im saying of you are gonna force people to respec twice a week you gonna have to pay them. Most guilds dont have a core 40 so good luck turning down meme specs, also i got a max level character but aight lol.
---
Same here. Hit 52 on my Prot Warrior (Alliance) on a PvP server as soon as P2 dropped. 50+ areas became unplayable with FP camping and killing quest givers.
---
I left and re-rolled on a PvE server until BGs came out so I could actually play. BGs came out so I decided to go back in. Literally the second I sign in, I’m killed by a group of 3 Horde 60s in the middle of nowhere in Felwood. Respawn, boom. Killed again. After a 3rd time I logged out and haven’t gone back.
---
People don't join PvP servers to do PvP. They do it to grief. There's plenty of *real* PvP to be had and that's in the battlegrounds which are available on PvE servers.
---
Currently playing druid, usually tanking since that's what most groups need. I roll on everything that I need whether it's for feralDPS/balance/healing/tanking.
---
I fucking love it, if someone complains, I'm more than happy to leave and they can find another tank.
---
I only ever played Horde in Retail and decided to roll Alliance when I started with Classic. It's pretty much the only way to get some novelty and refreshing experience out of a 15 year old game for me and I haven't been disappointed so far.
---
Yeah, they're like *super* hostile to anyone who dares to be OOC at any time.  Nobody raids - they're all just dicking around small towns in whatever gear looks purdiest, drinking virtual beer and pretending they're drunk.  Anyone who joins The Mobb is an idiot.
---
Right? Like if you want there to be less douches you also need to not be one. Just because someone else started it doesn’t make you not one for taking it to the next level. So childish.
---
Are the paid transfers up and running right now?
---
To be nitpicking, they added a fractal this year !
---
Also, GW2 content doesn't work the same like wow/ff14. You don't have gear treadmill in GW2. Content added in 2012/2013/2016/whatever else are still playable and useful. You don't "loose content" like in wow, where a new raid/expansion appearing mean everything else you did before could as well be deleted  or never existed because there is absolutely no point of doing it. 
---
So while it lack of "total" content in comparison to wow/ff14, the "effective" content that you can do and have interest to do is on par if not higher. For a dev team twice smaller than FF14 (which is twice smaller than wow) it's far from bad. There is more than enough for any normal player, even one who play several hours per day for months if not years.
---
It's expensive for what it is.  It's cheap in terms of opportunity cost, but that's not the only way to look at things.
---
HUGE HONOR
---
Because it’s the players that have a problem with it... Let the players sort it out. This hand-holding mentality of 2019 is ridiculous...
---
You know that’s how it was back then you right
---
For anyone interested, here is the macro for quickly turning in quests. You have to spam it, but it's still a lot faster than manually doing it. I also used it when turning in Runecloth for UC rep. I personally just have it on my action bar, unbound. I move it to Mouse Wheel Down when I need to use it, as I don't need it often.

To followup on this, once you complete the Plagued Hatchlings quest, you are eligible to loot "Healthy Dragon Scale" from those same Plagued hatchlings in Scholomance. They are items that start a quest to turn in to someone at Eastern Plaguelands and reward 50 rep. You can have multiple of them on you at once, and when they do drop, everyone eligible in party loots them. You get on average somewhere between 0 to 4 scales per run.
---
The optimal way of farming Scholomance run does this in a way to where you complete the Dawn's Gambit quest so you can kill Vectus and that other guy nobody cares about in that room. Once used, you turn in whatever healthy scales to that person in Eastern Kingdom, and that same person you turn them into is the one that gives you the Dawn's Gambit item you can use the next time you do Scholo.
---
It's how I got to exalted in phase 1 easily.
---
Did you end up finding something to solve this issue? I'm a druid who tanks and pvps, and am looking for something similar so i can load my pve profile or my pvp profile.
---
There were much better ways of handling it than this way. This way is completely unregulated and also will cost you money. Blizzard could have put in way more effort than this.
---
That's gonna be a no from me dog.
---
And now they want your money for you to fix the imbalance server which will never happen.
---
Eh most pservers were heavily alliance favoured
---
But genuinely, yeah, fuck the segment of this community that is unrepentantly jobless.
---
Minimum work, maximum money
---
Pfft all I wanted was sunfruit anyways. IDC about exalted until naxx, but future me can deal with that. Screw that guy.
---
I dont think the racials are so huge that you'll want to reroll for racials. I mean ofc its up to you but I honestly dont think its too big a deal.
---
I’m mainly talking about top 1% or more earners.
---
What stops you from buying 100s of cheap epics or reageanrs on the pve server and sell them on the pvp for more than 2000?
---
/cast [@hoffer605] Curse of Toes

I want to transfer my main to another server that I was able to reserve the name I wanted. If I create a character with the same name as my main on the new server Im transferring to ill be prompted for a name change, right? And then I can just delete the character I made to reserve the name and rename my main.

This was from 2 days ago. Horde russians didn't want us to zerg, so we started turtling instead. They threw everything at us. Flying riders, Icelord. We held our ground. After 2 hours we started to slowly push back and eventually win the game.
---
I would fact check that with classic. I remember the item clearly states a racial riding skill requirement.
---
Is it common knowledge or a common assumption?
---
You still need the training to ride it
---
Points for calling them "jamoke"
---
So now all AQ Scepter holders that didn't manage to hit the gong on their realm will just transfer off to realms with gates still closed. Good job Blizzard.
---
GW2 has zero maintenance at all due to some server thing they use.
---
&gt; The game is inherently flawed that Horde is slanted to PvP
---
Disagree. Paladins are ridiculously overpowered as PvP healers and completely negate any advantage horde have from racials.
---
&gt; I've yet to see a suggestion given that doesn't create another significant issue and isn't just a band-aid fix. 
---
I've seen plenty.
---
&gt; Something people were against Blizzard adjusting.
---
People were against it? Since when does that matter? There are people on both sides of every issue. 
---
In the end it's Blizzard's game and it's their responsibility to manage these things.
---
So wack having toons of different factions on the same server.
---
Whether or not they do this is a litmus test for whether they care about classic as an experience AND a cash cow, or as just a cash cow. This is a way for them to make money and fix issues with classic at the same time. Let's hope they don't fuck it up.
---
Not even Horde or Alliance. There's 9,500 people active on this subreddit right now. It's entirely possible that there's enough people on both sides of the debate to be loud and annoying.
---
Cause meaningful gear is gated behind the shit part. Gear that is useful for your team if you get it. Not to mention it is rude to your comrades to "be too good for the grind" whilst they went through grinding lots of hours in this piss poor bg.

I guess you decided to respond with out actually reading what I typed

&gt; Let the players sort it out.
---
By breaking the census addon so literally have no way to sort it out?
---
Good plan!
---
The right thing is to either follow-up with more heals or wait it out from a distance and rez.  That buff puts you on those aggro tables, eff that
---
Or the responding horde "See we have it bad too"
---
My main is a char who used to be an alt so i used the that belonged to a famous vanilla character. Now hes my main and i run a raiding guild and i wish i had used my original name that ive used for 15 years now.
---
What whelps are you talking about? The searing whelps in badlands that drop flame sacs are lvl38-43. Are there lower whelps that drop flame sacs?
---
That's like, maybe 15 hours of min wage work. Still a significantly lower investment than re-rolling if you're 60.
---
Too bad the Shadowplay gods weren't as generous :/
---
Every other clip has audio... no idea why this one doesn't.
---
That’s shitty, hopefully you tell the group before the run starts that you are planning to take everything.
---
Ah, i was just wondering because you can only gain 2 (or 3?) ranks a week anyway.
---
What are you, a bond villain? You just told me your whole plan.
---
Its my tiered out epic 60 mage i cant risk it. Ive heard there are stipulations to that process.
---
Does anyone think if things got even more imbalanced they would open it up to PVE &gt; PVP in the future? Just so that option is there. 
---
Also, if anyone knows the answer.. Why do they not allow the PVE &gt; PVP in the first place? 
---
Thanks in advance.
---
Same here. Got my warrior to 60 with some epics and my mage and priest both in the 40 range. The only benefit is the 35k xp an hour through zf and sm with rested.
---
All these people with 2x 60s... feelsbadman
---
Really I think the mounts just changed how zones are approached enough I have a hard time meandering around in them like I used to. Good to hear raiding calmed down, I had multiple full ascended sets for various stat combinations and rune choices, along with literally every legendary my profession could use, but because I skipped the first few weeks of raiding, no one would entertain the idea of taking me. I eventually got my way into raids by faking an item tooltip for the marks people were asking for, but ultimately was too far gone at that point to keep invested. Went hard on fractals for a long time, but after awhile, it just wasnt enough there to keep me going with them. I added a bit on pvp to my old post after you had already replied, but nothing too important.
---
I still very much love that game and am watching it carefully hoping I can justify going back to it one day, but atm I feel like I am better off hoping for a GW2 Classic or something along those lines. Glad to hear it is still active and that people are enjoying it though.

You're completely wrong about the ragecost of heroic strike, queuing heroic strike turns your offhand into a yellow hit that generates rage negating glancing blows and giving it hit cap. 
---
You are also nowhere near dual wield hit capped so you can't count the main hand hit as guaranteed rage. 
---
This is all ignoring that you will be nearly rage capped dual wield tanking.
---
I don't want to use blind on the pet, and gouge doesn't work for me. if I gouge I'll get the restealth, but the pet will still be following me which I'm trying to prevent.
---
Uhh this is straight up wrong. 
---
So blue shoulders + legs or shoulders + helm is phase 3 bis depending on faction. The 40 AP makes it better than drake talon pauldrons. Your lack of awareness of this being BiS is concerning.
---
So if I have r10 shoulders in BWL, then I get to pass on drake talon pauldrons, but I basically get  a weapon or a DFT instead. By getting rank gear, you only need a few pieces of loot from raid and they should prio to you as others need Drake Talon Pauldrons.
---
It doesnt require wolf riding.
---
I tried getting people to do this and got told basically /effort. Hell I cant even get my guild to make warlock summoning alts for the world bosses: they just gave up and conceded that the server first guild (that made said alts) will get every SINGLE WB kill. I don't understand them. Same guys happy to farm Dm:E for 800 times for the dragon book and live in ZF for gold, won't push for a scout alt?
---
i didnt think ye could make characters from both factions on the same realm
---
Estimated time:  Several minutes
---
Yeah, that is a good point, but the difference in value of items is huge between some PvP servers as well, this is not an issue that is exclusive to PvE-PvP transfers.
---
Whitemane is also the 3rd most populated server and has queues every other evening. I'm not sure if the server could handle more transfers.
---
Are these still restricted by server balance? Are alliance freely allowed to transfer off again?
---
Exactly, so thinking that 300k will get you to r10 is laughable
---
They have flaired official reps in here.
---
Wellll. You stopped replying so guess I win this one. Thanks for making me feel like the victor.
---
Haha that’s exactly what had me dying!
---
I don't believe there would be a realistic difference playing on an 80/20 vs 95/5 server for either faction.
---
Surprise!
---
The smaller the sample size the larger the margin or error.
---
Today
---
Yes, because it it technically buffing a different stat within the "potion" buff slot. 
---
Later when elixir of fire power is added to the game you can coincidentally use it with frost and arcane elixirs.
---
Im hoping so too.. seen a lot of ppl at like 99% into their rank
---
&gt;I am better off hoping for a GW2 Classic or something along those lines
---
Urk, honestly, GW2 today, even for his faults, is way better tha, GW2 "classic" in every way. While there is an interest in coming back to the primitive state of wow, i don't think vanilla GW2 have anything where he isn't inferior to the recent one.
---
However, a "GW1 classic"...hm...
---
Back in phase 1 when Devilsaur was still expensive, there was a guy who stood on our kill and said “I’m going to stand here until despawn if I have to.” So my friend opened trade request window with him and I looted/skinned at the same time. We successfully got that skin and the guy told us to go fuck ourselves or something.
---
After that, we got super lucky with all the spawns and got every single one for a couple hours. Eventually, we ran into the guy again about to kill a Devilsaur. An undead rogue came in to jump him and get honor and his leather. Of course me and my friend were true gentlemen....we let the rogue kill this guy then we killed the rogue and then the Devilsaur =D
---
Best part was after this, the guy asked to team up with us and split the leather.
---
They lubed that’s butthole up for like 3 months now they’re slowly inserting the dick of real money services. Feels a little premeditated.
---
&gt; Players are only allowed to log in from the faction with fewer players currently logged in. The faction with more players on line waits in queue.
---
I pay a monthly fee to play a game, not to be forced to wait in a queue.
---
This idea sucks balls.
---
Oh, so I did miss that. Mb. 
---
Easy to miss a small line of accurate info when the person has been going on about something silly. 
---
Humans being humans lol
---
You cant on PVP servers.   
---
So something is off with this unless everyone involved turned on their pvp flag.
---
Getting over 1 million honor does not mean account sharing, thats "easily" doable with a decent premade. Though not logging off all week is something else :^)
---
you all are not understanding what "spending 5 minutes reading up someone else's analysis on a website where the info comes from the game 15 years ago" means.
---
It actually doesn't even take 5 minutes.  Takes 1minute with searching the item name and scrolling down to see what people wrote 15 years ago lol.  It's not rocket science lol.
---
The top dps rotation for hunters is melee weaving by far where you use multi/aimed when off CD and get in auto attacks with your melee+ranged. This is also probably the hardest dps rotation in classic.
---
The big thing for me is the Onyxia quest line.  It's built up as a grand conspiracy, which you start pulling threads on at level 10.  The Defias Brotherhood, the Blackrock Orcs, the Redridge Gnolls, the undead in Duskwood, the unexplained absence of the King of Stormwind, all are part of the story.  You cap it off with a pretty sweet escort quest out of BRD and RP event in the Stormwind Keep throne room.  Turning in her head for the quest reward is the completion of the entire story.
---
You'll be fine as disc or holy with shadow.  Just go deep enough in shadow for weaving and then Holy/Disc to taste.  You should be raid healing as your talents won't lend themselves well to high sustain for tank healing.
---
Lawl #nochanges
---
I can't help but feel like that's the goal. It will be much easier to start closing realms and forcing everyone to transfer when their population has already naturally dwindled (and they got money from all those who were willing to pay for the transfer on top of that)
---
Cries in Feral
---
Our guild got an Eye of Sulfuras, and crafted the legendary and we STILL have not seen an OEB, Earthshaker, or BRE.  It's bananas.
---
Are race changes gonna be available too  now? Or soon?
---
As horde I don't mind the queue, I farmed my swiftthistle for the week + some, but I'm definitely jealous. See you on the field!
---
Yeah some people are asshats some arent. I was farming soul shards at Raven Hill last night, another lock came I invited him, he said he only needed a few, I gave him a mistletoe buff he whispered me when he left 10 mins later. Sometimes people are nice.
---
right?! I got flamed for saying it takes less time than making a cup of coffee to find yet people want to waste hours grinding after the fact lol.
---
I have a 60 Paladin and a 57 Warrior...when the warrior hits 60, they’ll each get two days a week and I’ll work on a Hunter
---
Maybe it wasn't so much the game, but they realized the community was a toxic piece of shit and they had no interest in continuing to play with them.
---
and so the game died
---
Lookup "sow" in urban dictionary. It is a derogatory term used against women, commonly used in the oriental erotic material.
---
I feel that way as well, but I feel like the game became super stagnate to me and I had to do it. If you feel like that's the case do whats right for yourself. I'm sure your guild would rather see you still playing than quitting all together. Nothing wrong with leveling a toon on the opposing faction on the side, that's always an option as well. You can always go back if they need a fill spot!
---
Im poking around with it and there does not seem to be any pve or pvp restrictions
---
Not available in EU as of now. Someone in US already tried if it works?
---
Can we give this up? I get it, people are mad, but this posts and posts like have been necroed a hundred times over the course of phase two.
---
Ok. I’m on Kirtonos so that’s the same battlegroup. I haven’t been keeping score but I’d say alliance has won about half of the games. The longer the game goes on the more likely horde is going to win though. That’s definitely the experience everyone has had.
---
Frostbite is better. My question is should I continue using the Bone Slicing Hatchet as my offhand? Lower DPS and Stam/Agi instead of STR but a much faster attack speed than AotDW.
---
So basically, after Frostbite: Continue using Bone Slicing Hatchet or use AotDW?
---
This is the question you are saying was poorly worded.
---
This was your retarded response:" Well Axe of the Deep woods is main hand only so I would say you have to keep using Bone slicing hatchet. "
---
Then you give this asshole statement:" Sorry for answering your poorly worded question with the most logical answer. "
---
Jesus christ dude figure it out.
---
It wasn’t me who did it but my buddy. And it is true.
---
Find a different hardcore raiding guild on a pve server. If you join a pvp server expect pvp and ganking. fuck off
---
Oh thanks. Do you know how it works now? Does it still global threat wipe the entire raid?
---
No but since it’s easier to get gold on pve server, it’s easier to buy a lot of stuff. 
---
That same stuff is harder to get on pvp meaning it will be more expensive. 
---
You will potentially disrupt the pvp economy at no cost since you farmed on pve
---
No shit. What you’re not picking up on is that people don’t analyze that or consider that when given a token that says to turn in for a reward. No one cares that much. This is a funny meme post about that reaction and it’s not even that big of a deal. Relax.
---
I play on satelite internet. I have yet to play the game on less than 700ms. I'm having a blast and am 11/11 with my guild. It's what you make it.
---
First mistake was having your day off on a Tuesday. I never fell terminally ill where I would have to stay home from school on a Tuesday as a kid. And now as an adult Tuesday is the day I show up early and stay late. 
---
Wednesday is my show up late leave early day mwahahahaha
---
from a blue post 
---
&gt;Here are the current rage generation formulae (note: these are slightly different than the ones which are on the current public test realms).  
---
The notable changes include an update to offhand rage generation (previously it was not being normalized correctly), and an improvement to rage generation from crits (essentially, crits now generate double the rage the hit would have ordinarily caused). The later change should help ensure that certain specs (ie: sword specialization) don't become clearly superior to crit-enhancing specializations like Axe/Polearm.  
---
For Dealing Damage:  
---
Main Hand Normal Hits: Factor=2.5  
---
Main Hand Crits: Factor=5.0  
---
Off Hand Normal Hits: Factor=1.25  
---
Off Hand Crits: Factor=2.5  
---
&gt;Rage Conversion Value (note: this number is derived from other values within the game such as a mob's hit points and a warrior's expected damage value against that mob):  
---
Rage Conversion at level 60: 230.6  
---
Rage Conversion at level 70: 274.7  
---
Expansion Rage Gained from dealing damage = ((Damage Dealt) / (Rage Conversion at Your Level) \* 7.5 + (Weapon Speed \* Factor))/2  
---
Pre-Expansion Rage Gained from dealing damage = (Damage Dealt) / (Rage Conversion at Your Level) \* 7.5  
---
For Taking Damage (both pre and post expansion):  
---
Rage Gained = (Damage Taken) / (Rage Conversion at Your Level) \* 2.5 
---

Strange take, since historically these myths have more often than not been an excuse to wage war on anyone who believes in a slightly different myth.  The Opiate of the Masses is the oldest way to manufacture consent.  Granted, modern mass media has to a large extent eclipsed these older methods, but it still plays a role.
---
You want people to be kinder to one another?  Teach them philosophy. Realize the importance of social IQ.  Encourage open-mindedness and tolerance.  Taking fables as literal truths are completely unnecessary to spreading the positive values that may exist as a component of the overall mythos.
---
Anyone in here from ILL? I heard they were active on Sulfuras earlier today and need to know if this is true.
---
The long game:  Allow paid server transfers, resulting in extremely unbalanced servers. 
---
Then, combine alliance-dominated with horde-dominated servers. 
---
Result:  balanced servers.
---
Your honor woulda placed you in the top 75 on my server
---
Just use a friendly guildie as a mule.  Or pay some shmuck in a major city to hold the water for you.  A random level 10 would gladly hold a couple stacks of high level water for a few gold tip.  3 gold to a level 15 would make their night.
---
I’m talking about top 1% or more earners. A significant portion of life at that level is doing things that aren’t pleasant.

There are core facets of wow classic that still connect with players after all the time, sometime along the way we lost what made a lot of us fall in love with the game. Sometimes its the small things. Classic isnt perfect by any stretch, but theres a reason people will continue to play it in spite of its flaws.
---
Did you know that you can go fuck yourself?
---
That's actually my favorite part of gw2 is the gear, the issue is if they developed the game with any sort of urgency there should be an ocean of raids dungeons and different styles of pvp and maps, look at how much legacy content ff and wow have if gw2 was doing things right the game could be absolutely massive with relevant content and it just isn't.
---
Oooh that's makes more sense, sounds like I should just farm the extra 100g for my mount haha
---
Unless you're with friends, guildies or a PUG that allows it, the unspoken rule is to only roll on MS gear. Sadly, in Classic, if you want OS gear, then you gotta respec or you're going to keep getting harassed unfortunately.
---
I’ve been running full dmeast runs recently. I kill hydro and the satyr boss. There’s another book spawn deeper in the dungeon by the girl+big imp boss. I don’t kill the 4 packs of demons but I kill all the packs of big demons+small demons. The gold gains are ridiculous with the added felcloth, and like 4-6 ghost mushrooms per run. Essence of water and blues to sell from the bosses. Dm east honestly has insane gold making potential
---
Keep spreading that PvP lie you probably don’t even play the game at all. It’s not half of the entire game you are missing. On Pve servers you can still do world PvP as well as BGs are our now which is what most people do. Unless you consider half the game just getting camped by higher levels. It’s such a stupid blanket statement to make by people who just blindly state that PvP servers are “better”. You said 1hr a day but even if you play like 3hrs a day that’s not enough for a PvP server you’re going to spend all your time corpse running. Not everyone who plays classic is an unemployed person who can play 8+ hours a day.
---
&gt; 5 AV rep
---
for EVERYONE in the bg.
---
Weird, i got a warrior to 54 then tolled rogue and got him to 60, now im on a 38 mage, its worth it.
---
What’s there to plan for?
---
Even if it knows what it’s doing, but the DPS is slower
---
Have 3 level 40 toons and my rogue at 47 is by far the most fun. Have not done many dungeons but whatever
---
Fair enough.
---
you really enjoy building multidimensional gradient matrixes, dont you
---
you cant incentivize pvpers to play alliance because of outdated balance. alliance leveling is worse, alliance world pvp experience is worse. are the factions closer to being balanced than not for the top tier of players? maybe, but that doesnt matter when 1% of players are the top (by definition).
---
faction queues are legit the only way to do it, but its far too late now. and btw they DID change racials in wow's history and people DID reroll/faction change. the problem is horde has been so good for so long, that its far too late.
---
u fked upppp
---
Nope, I still don't have any idea what class to main. I decided to step away from the game for a few weeks and come back fresh and I still can't decide.
---
What is that addon that I see streamers using to hotswap trinkets by hovering over something on their cast bar?

Hopefully for their sake the next tabk they get isn’t a greedy prick...

I’m in this comment and I don’t like it

Thank you to everyone who commented, even those who have scorned me for leaving the Horde. If there is anyone on the realm Heartseeker, send me a PM and I'd love to play with you. Best of luck Gamers!
---
Imagine being this socially inept.
---
Could be.  I met a rogue leveling my alt that was an alliance mage that was leveling a horde rogue for this exact thing lol.
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxuMgktZVbhtr](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxuMgktZVbhtr)   
---
I'm actually running this spec for PvE and PvP and I never had this much fun playing the class really.   
---
You get the same healing output a pure holy pally would have, but you can also deal a crushing burst (Hammer of justice, melee swing (SoC proc??) judgement, holy shock. I frequently find myself clapping 50% hp on hordes with that spec.
---
As far as I can tell with the 1 pull we've had since the fix is that it wipes everyones threat and knocks up 3 random people.
---
&gt; It takes on average 7 days played to hit 60.
---
Do you have a source for that that is relevant for Classic? Or is it based upon data from private servers?
---
I was playing on Thunderfury for a little bit. How is the faction balance these days?
---
Tbh if anyone wants an easier rank 14 they will transfer TO flamelash imho
---
If there’s only enough space for one person you should respect that the spot is taken if it’s on your faction. Just because it’s a game doesn’t mean you abandon common decency. People use video games as an excuse to act without grace. Not that I care. Just a game. I ain’t a mage.
---
It's really not that big a deal.  If you cloned the same guy and had them put in the same amount of effort and time, except one on a PvP server and the other on a PvE server...their gear would probably still be identical, or maybe one negligible difference here or there.
---
Signed,
---
Someone that's only ever played on PvP servers
---
On a pve server? Not a chance. Only world pvp going on favored ranged so heavily that melee is at least a month behind.
---
Faction queues are negative incentives.
---
You *could* try positive incentives. Level 60 horde on a horde-dominated server? If you press this button that faction-changes all of your characters to Alliance, you get some gold and 30 days free game time for each level 40+ character. 
---
Like with warmode on retail, where blizzard encourages Alliance to opt into PvP. They get weekly quests to go and kill 25 Horde for a piece of gear equivalent to normal raid gear. They get +25% rewards from open-world activities while in war-mode while Horde get +10%. 
---
I'm not sure if this sort of stuff would help and how much it would help, but it would be a start. The fear of course is that the only people switching over would be the more casual horde players who wouldn't help much with faction balance.
---
If only the necroknight garb was available, would be bis for this type of farm.
---
I rushed the creation screen on launch so I would be glad to finally redo my character.
---
You can know what you're doing and just be undergeared. In weeks 3-6 of Classic my raids had add phases. Getting everyone geared enough to do sub 3 minute Rag takes a while (Though it is easier now with Dire Maul).
---
As a troll, he/she cannot.
---
Would that keep you from making very obvious reposts?
---
So, what you are saying contradicts your previous statement. If they can only get shit gear and not very well tuned for Retribution, someone who has similar time in MC as a prot warrior being able to do more damage is then expected, not "not gear properly or are shit at what they do"
---
Thanks for the help!
---
What about the servers that have &lt;100 alliance? Now you locked out 99% of the server player base from playing there characters.
---
More like stare and wonder how this person had so much time to waste in their lives.
---
Now the *real* wait: Will Faerlina lose its evening queues (or even fully become a Horde playground in open world) or am I taking that dive to Mankrik PvE
---
This dropped a lot sooner than expected though but at least now I don't have to consider rerolling a third Warrior
---
Meant honor obviously
---
literally it's common knowledge and not in any way an assumption
---
If all you want to do is stay home all day and play wow on the maintenance day, you need to pick another day where you like to stay home and play wow all day!
---
Same thing with the rain... If you are doing something outside you check the weather forecast. Obviously not perfect but you mitigate a lot of chance of bad weather by taking 2 seconds to google "weather on X date".
---
3 months is nothing. Gonna be a bunch of people server hopping for AQ gate steals..
---
TrinketMenu is a solid guess
---
F Blizzard for allowing my server to get completely screwed by the free transfers - and now making me pay to transfer in order to play on a remotely balanced and populated server. I was about to question their logic, but I think they just don’t care. I’m so disappointed in how they’ve handled all this.
---
No resist gear?  You mean haven't needed resist gear YET.
---
6 of my IRL friends started on launch day.  ONLY 1 of the 6 have a 60, the rest of us are leveling "main alts" still lol
---
I think it may depend on server also im guessing ? Im on herod and people go HARD on this server with farming anything
---
This only describes most guilds on most realms just join any guild that advertises in trade chat and doesn't seem to have any requirements.  Or sit unguilded on a lvl 5 character and wait on invite spam, it won't take long.
---
Mhm yeah, I can see that! I had never played WoW before this- and going in blind was honestly pretty magical.
---
I don’t understand what these people playing 16-18 hours a day are seeking to accomplish. Yes you get “gear” and online clout, but at what cost? Do these people get paid to do this? What incentive would someone have to essentially sacrifice real life to play a game for 16 hours every day? No wonder blizz is shutting it off every Tuesday.
---
I don't tell them unless they ask, the same way the healing paladin doesn't tell us that he's going to roll on +dmg gear, the same way that the shadow priest doesn't tell us he's going to roll on +heal gear.
---
I've never had a problem with that because the natural assumption is that they are going to use it. 
---
Yet people here seem to get shitty at the idea that you roll need on something that you are going to use outside of the instance.
---
Horde have a slight 1v1 advantage but Alliance have the strongest racial ability in the game in group PVP. Blessing of Freedom.
---
damn im sorry brother lol thats worse than mine
---
At Mid-40's you should be able to solo anything up to SM.
---
Took us 3 weeks to get it down, but one week we amped fire res ok tanks up to 345 and we killed rag after a single try after that. Runs used to take two days, but we’ve now got it down to a comfortable 2.5 hrs
---
By making balance changes.
---
Just look at the history of Vanilla through TBC. Alliance was over populated, so Blizzard introduced a pretty Horde race (Blood Elves) and gave them a flat out overpowered racial (PbAOE silence AND mana back).
---
They absolutely were not. There's spreadsheets and Reddit posts showing that.
---
Well in my ranking I was 942 last week and moved up to 440 but Barely moved up
---
I was under the impression you did. 15 year old memories are not the best haha
---
No they aren’t! Literally look at all the helpful comments! People say lots of different things that will help me think about what a better weapon would be. You’re basically calling everyone that responded helpfully un trust worthy, or even wrong. You are in a terrible little cynical bubble
---
Maybe cause more people are playing and methods have changed?  Not sure though.
---
Sure, but the way the comment was phrased was instead of shadow force, because its just one less, but shadow damage is all that matters pve
---
The guilds that are going to achieve Rank 14 are accomplishing something though. They plan meticulously and coordinate their honor so their members hit R14 and then others can move in after. Lots of top guilds rolled alliance because they can mostly get into the same AV together. If you watch them fight in AV they are just as coordinated as any raid team because that's what they are. AV is basically a raid, but there's a bunch of people trying to make you fail. Guilds min maxed their faction decision for queue times to max honor per hour and the truly coordinated ones easily stomp AV. That's the game to them and that's how they like to play together. On this sub today every post about R14 is slowly working through the stages of grief realizing they will never be Rank 14. Your post is the first step denial. Denial of any achievement associated with 14. Next is pain then anger and bargaining and finally depression. Upward turn happens here though and the last 2 are reconstruction and working through the grief and finally acceptance. Don't get to caught up in ranking, play the game to have fun the way you have fun with the people you play with and let others do the same.
---
Probably a lot. I mean this is by no means a surprise. I guess I was just hoping that they'd keep balancing incentives in place.
---
Only way alliance possibly could. Can’t get past 30 on most of the pvp servers.
---
I live on the east coast and I remember wow frequently still being down on tuesdays when I got home from school.
---
Priest can be the most evil class in the game if they want.
---
They got the MC stuff but for horde priest, if you give fort buff to people falling off zepps, most of the times they'll die. Except for rogues obviously.
---
I had 2 accounts in BC when I was young and had extra money to burn.
---
Yes, limitations.
---
can you transfer chars to another account with the same name?
---
Does this still happen? I read that the infernal disappears after a kinute.
---
The honor belongs on my character, not in some random database. If it's not on my character for any reason, it's missing. You can try to spin it that it's not missing because they had the data somewhere, but it's clear that "missing" means "missing from where it is supposed to be." If my keys are lost in my couch instead of on my table where they are supposed to be, they are missing even though they still exist somewhere in my house.
---
Would be interested if this turns out to be true.
---
But the feral dps mace is gold from gnomer. Horde and alliance.
---
Dead meme and I’m 23 fucking nonce. Why don’t you fuck off your opinion is worth less than shit to me.
---
I feel the "xD" has done something to you personally
---
Oof, I feel like it's father obligation to pass an item like that to their son who has been farming.  He probably knew no better, but still!
---
Anyone looking for an easy ranking experience come to Noggenfogger! 800k is the honor cap here.

---
Another revenue stream for Blizzard to not fund HotS
---
k.

Blizzard thinks so too!
---
Yes Dbm does if you are in range.
---
I think dbm only gives you like 15-30 second.
---
Dropped one other night and noticed.
---
Yes you do.
---
I think you're mistaken. More people are going to play **because** they have the ability to choose what server they want rather than quit because they ended up on some shitty 80/20 server.
---
Yea our server, Westfall, has slowly gotten better horde side. Those original couple months were brutal when there were only a few of us ahead of the leveling curve of most players. It started out 80/20 Alliance/Horde. The few weeks of wPVP were not fun either, when everytime we killed a few alliance in Hillsbrad, another 40 alliance would show up.
---
exactly, don't waste money on mighty rage when the cheap one does the job just fine. 
---
for added benefit, macro your bloodrage to \[mod=alt\] /use Rage Potion
---
Horde or alliance dominated?
---

I got downvoted for basically the same comment.   It's not elitist to expect some standards. Also if my character is lvl 30 and still hasn't joined your spammy guild it's obviously because I don't want in.

---
Only 3 different individuals though.
---
There will be literally hundreds of people ready to hit that gong as soon as it is physically possible, the next 100 people still get the rewards. There's more risk transferring to an unopened server than there is just racing on the one you're on.
---
It's so obvious that a druid will likely roll on healer gear that you shouldn't even have to state it at the start, even if they're tanking. I'd be more surprised if the druid WASN'T looking for healing gear.
---
I actually considered adding "Unless of course Colbert plays WoW Classic" to the end of my comment lol
---
Hunter pet would get more fire resistance too. Hunter 3 set gives more stam and healing too.
---
I take it you didn't notice my flair.
---
Boohoo
---
This would be a failed plot

&gt; 8 hours of downtime per week is 96% uptime, which isn't bad. 
---
Stats are fun. But compare it with the amount of downtime prior to the BG patch. Doesnt look so good. 
---
&gt; Especially so when, as I said, it's something we all already agreed to by playing the game to begin with.
---
No one agreed to a set length of downtime. I guess you didnt get my kitchen angle. Let me try again. We know there will be downtime. Just like you know sometimes a kitchen messes up and there is a wait. You agree to both when you buy the game/sit down at the table. But, an 8 hour downtime in 2019 *is* unusual. And its  a large increase over the previous months. Its totally reasonable to complain about it, just like you can complain about a long wait or messed order at a restaurant. No one is asking you to fire the cook, its just about not being so massive a fan boy that you cant see the obvious. Its about having enough self confidence to hold people to standards. 
---
&gt; condescendingly waving your $15 in the air 
---
No one cares about the money. No one is quitting over this. Its about you guys coming to a thread like this and desperately feeling the need to tell other people their opinion isn't valid. Its just goofy. Like you want a gold star or something for having low expectations.
---
Except if all no life pvpers do the same then they're joining a server with tougher competition.

Honor cap on noggenfogger is 800k if you want an easy ride  to ranks transfer over.

Jesus shit if I’m going to spend 10 or more hours grinding rep, you’d better fucking believe I’m gonna take three minutes to read comments about what I’m doing before I start 
---
That’s how normal people think anyway
---
You right click the minimap icon and open the tab that has your gear. Alt + right click any piece of gear to create a floating button for it. It will show up in the middle of your screen, drag the button wherever you want it and click the button to see all other items you have for that slot.
---
weird flex, but okay.
---
It one shots lowbies so in the span of a minute it can kill quite a few, completely souring the experience for anyone that has never played the game before.

Aggravates me they charge $25 for something that's wholly automated and doesn't give a "product" in the way pets and cosmetics do.

Yea its either bugged or people on my server just farmed too much honor im not sure i hope its a bug and they fix it
---
I was thinking fires of heaven but they might have renamed?  Idk, was a long time ago and details have faded.  Both of the names sound familiar.
---
Indeed
---
Log out and wait 5 mins, you’ll be at the start of the same instance when you log back in and can just run out and quickly reset.  
---
I do it in Dire Maul heaps.
---
or you wanted confirmation and knew reddit would lean more in favor of your opinion.
---
Probably a hunter from the other night who ganked me at Hearthglen while I was at 400hp.  I found his shadowmeld before I took my rez and just absolutely dunked on him.  I expected it to be easy 1v1ing someone who ganks you at 400hp while fighting a mob, but this player backpeddled, keyboard turned, I thought they might have been a bot.  It was my first time corpse camping someone and it felt so good.
---
So they were down for 6 hours instead of 8.., still down for longer than usual.
---
Its weird when someone gets a sense of identity around a guild that spams invites to literally everyone.
---
stop being so dramatic you big bubba baby
---
guilds moving, individuals moving.  I'm on a low pop server, every person counts.
---
last survey i saw of this showed a 60/40 horde alliance - Playing Alliance on this server i related to every complaint made by other Alliance players of getting into BRD, questing in WP/EP.  I think this is accurate.  You could NOT quest before BGs and after World PVP dropped.  It is known.
---
Don’t forget people. You lose all of your honor it basically gets reset when u transfer
---
I'm fully aware of all this. I've been playing since Vanilla.
---
Blood Elves are not germane to the topic because until Blizzard says otherwise, Classic is Classic and any changes need to happen within that framework, so things like new races aren't really worth considering.
---
Lol that would be nice , I would grind to R14 if i was you !
---
Exalted is less about attunement costs and more about the full set of +frost resist gear you can craft. For tanks, it is also about +5 resist all.
---
Is Solo Dire Maul tribute farm on a hunter the best average gold per hour in the game currently? And will it remain to be the case for the rest of classic?
---
It's really not a flex. Everyone in my neck of the woods is bilingual.
---
Glad you're impressed by it though.
---
You know what he means, dont be coy. He is talking about the minority faction of the server.
---
Horde for sure
---
I know at some point before TBC you didn't need the faction riding skill, of that I am 100% certain. Which part of vanilla that was I'm unsure of.
---
Doing reliable premades in AV isn't super hard, but I wouldn't call it easy. The logging off bit is the key part, I agree 😁
---
so its basically like bfa, got it
---
I’d love to if I had time. Top dude was still over 800k though.
---
Made this mistake while leveling. Lucky for me I only turned in a few times before I remembered from the Vanilla days that I might want to save these and googled AD rep.
---
&gt; desperately feeling the need to tell other people their opinion isn't valid
---
For the 2nd time:  I never said it isn't valid.  In fact that's the very first sentence of my last post.  I simply disagree with it being a big enough deal to complain about.  To me, it reeks of someone desperate to latch on to something that might get them a freebie.  Like someone throwing a fit in a fast food restaurant.  It's a small inconvenience and complaining about it or asking for recompense as many do frankly comes across as kind of classless.  Again, *in my opinion.*
---
That's not normal...
---
Normal is you roll on the gear for the role you're playing in the dungeon/group and warn people before you roll on something else.
---
What you're doing is a dick move.
---
Which is why I'm saying priest is the hardest to gear, you can't compete with druids/shamans/paladins for leather/mail/plate healing pieces that they might be able to use, but all of those classes will be trying to get the same nontier-cloth pieces that you're trying to get.
---
Hell yeah. I can finally play again. My 60 has been sitting on Arcanite Reaper for idk how long. I made a stupid mistake taking the free transfer and it stressed me the fuck out when I realized it.
---
I just hope people don't wreck the realm populations
---
Is this only if you dont have Aged core leather gloves? If you ignore the wep skill since u get it from gloves. Is lobo a better weapon than DD in off hand?
---
If the last son is banished doesn’t Rag emerge?
---
Leveled warrior first, which at this point I really only log in for raids and when I can stomach more HoJ farm runs. Got druid alchemist alt up to 60, but not really feeling it. Trying to decide what class I want to get to 60 and actually farm with.

the post was mainly looking at the prestige and the value of a competitive combat bracket vs earning rank 14. This can only bring good things to the game. I didn't discredit rank 14 i spoke truthfully about it. It is a time investment. I'm not asking for it to be taken away or even for any new rewards to be added for a different system. I'm asking why not add something that holds more value for at least myself and I'm sure other rated bg / arena players. The system we currently have including cross realm bgs has removed a social aspect of servers that existed prior. The AV grind is even removing some of the WSG premades that would be showing up. I believe that a ranked system could revitalize the players that are dreading a title that is not earned by skill but by time. Let there be two systems and have each hold their own value in the individuals eyes.
---
Ok so it won’t be 100% horde. It’ll be 99% horde and 1% alliance rankers.
---
If you were talking to me, I mentioned we only had add phases in weeks 3-6 of Classic. Another point you didn't cover though is they might not have a full 40.
---
Hold up.  Druid here...if you're tanking, the healer should NOT expect you to roll against them without warning.
---
You can either warn people or just roll if they don't need...but surprising the healer with a roll against them is a dick move.
---
There's a lot to it but this guy outlines it quite well:
---
Uh, yes, crazy... *nervous chuckle*
---
&gt; horde outnumbering us alliance ever so slightly at level 60
---
Say goodbye to all your alliance!
---
Balance wasn't too bad on our server, then they opened free transfers and the alliance fled to Heartseeker.
---
Still need a minimum of like 200 alliance pvpers every week
---
Your logic is flawed. Queue times didn't increase because more and more people were getting exalted. It's because alliance were reaching exalted much faster then horde since horde meta seems to be dictated by the lowest IQ players.
---
People camping outside, checking for it takes longer time than doing the full run due to that. Though battlegrounds made it better.
---
I can never understand ppl who only ever play 1 faction, you are missing half of the game

I don't mean religions, but the collective institutions large numbers of people believe exist, religion included. We all still believe in collective myths today, countries are a myth, so are corporations. They exist because we believe them to exist. The myths are just the cultural rules we follow that force us to interact in certain ways and allow us to work as a large scale group. Religions exist in the same sphere and while they have been used to justify war, they have also been used to encourage coexistence among large swaths of the population in the same way that countries and corporations also do. Without these myths humans in groups larger than 100 would likely not be able to cooperate in a way that has created our modern society. Here, Yuval Noah Harari says it much better than I can:
---
&gt;How did Homo Sapiens manage to cross this critical threshold, eventually founding cities comprising tens of thousands of inhabitants and empires ruling hundreds of millions? The secret was probably the appearance of fiction. Large numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths.
---
&gt;Any large-scale human cooperation - whether a modern state, a medieval church, an ancient city or an archaic tribe - is rooted in common myths that exist only in people's collective imagination. Churches are rooted in common religious myths. Two Catholics who have never met can nevertheless go together on crusade or pool funds to build a hospital because they both believe that God was incarnated in human flesh and allowed Himself to be crucified to redeem our sins. States are rooted in common national myths. Two Serbs who have never met might risk their lives to save one another because both believe in the existence of the Serbian nation, the Serbian homeland and the Serbian flag. Judicial systems are rooted in common legal myths. Two lawyers who have never met can nevertheless combine efforts to defend a complete stranger because they both believe in the existence of laws, justice, human rights = and the money paid out in fees. 
---
&gt;Yet none of these things exist outside the stories that people invent and tell one another. There are no gods in the universe, no nations, no money, no human rights, no laws, and no justice outside the common imagination of human beings. 
---
&gt;People easily acknowledge that 'primitive tribes' cement their social order by believing in ghosts and spirits, and gathering each full moon to dance together around the campfire. What we fail to appreciate is that our modern institutions function on exactly the same basis. Take for example the world of business corporations. Modern business people and lawyers are, in fact, powerful sorcerers. The principal difference between them and tribal shamans is that modern lawyers tell far stranger tales.
---
The very part that gave away the fact that this was fake the first time I saw this... As a teenager...  Still baffles me that anyone ever thought this waa real.
---
Rip.
---
Does balance even matter now that BGs are out?
---
Last thing before I go. I’m petty. But atleast I’m not you.
---
To be fair, this is my first time levelling Alliance. Stockades was wonderful for that level bracket. Go to the AH, repair, mail some gear and check your bank. Walk next door to the instance with a super short run back after death.
---
Dbm has been wrong every time I've seen it warn.  It'll give a 45 second warning and we get the buff 10 seconds later.
---
Ahhh, I see. I guess I read it to mean “can these people get in trouble for terrain abuse”
---
After playing with almost every class to level 10 or higher (minus mage and warrior) and even have made multiple characters past 10 for some classes, I am happy to report I have finally settled on a main. Unfortunately due to my altoholism I have started all over on a new server(s) so my main, which is a priest btw, is barely at 15 &amp; any future alts are at 0 :( Also I still have very strong urges to start an alt bc I see videos of certain classes &amp; want to play with them, but I have fully accepted my priest is my main and will try to not start on any more alts until I at least get my mount
---
Will do, had no idea... lol
---
I rolled an alt on Pagle during phase 2 to get away from the PvP madness and lvl18-40 had super fast groups for every dungeon, because the server was bustling with new characters due to the pvp refugee influx. However I imagine it probably has gotten worse since BGs released as a lot of ppl went back to their mains (I haven't logged into my Pagle alt for 10 days).
---
Hah! Yea, they never notice. I even keep my healer on follow at all times, yet no one questions why a priest is just walking into the middle of the mobs I pull.
---

What? The first post says frostbite is better. The second says check this spreadsheet (best answer). The third asks the question you had such a huge issue understanding. The fourth talks about how much rep you need for frostbite which was totally irrelevant.
---
The fifthsays that the proc from axe of the deep woods can proc windfury. No it can't. This makes no sense and has 0 impact on this discussion. 
---
The sixth is useless drivel. You dont need a flurry axe. 
---
And yea I 100% would run the spreadsheet myself and not trust some random guy's word on reddit. I see incorrect information touted as fact here every single day.  If you haven't realised the average redditor in this sub is pretty stupid yet, well maybe you are an average redditor on this sub.
---
How do you get the recipe for frost power elixir?
---
I'm not advocating for overhauling changes, but for tweaks to abilities and what not. Keeping things 100% static is just dumb, given current balance metrics.
---
Some suggestions would be to make Perception actually useful, tweak Escape Artist to instant cast, or make Paladins be actually anti-undead (forsaken) machines like they were in Wow-Beta.
---
Farming as a raid spec tank was so rough in vanilla that I leveled up a hunter w/ mining/herb just to fund my warrior. I logged the warrior for raid nights and BGs.
---
&gt;So instead of moving to another place we both lost hours of progression. That was my biggest mistake. 
---
"The only winning move is not to play."
---
I don't enjoy the PvE aspect as much as you then, dungeons especially since they're standard encounters with absolutely no risk of the opposing faction and done so often that you're basically following a scripted event unless someone facepulls a big group/pat or something.
---
It's just a process for me to acquire gear, and from the groups I've seen on PvP servers, they're there to acquire gear too. 
---
I honestly don't think I've ever had someone form a scholo/strath/BRD/BRS group 'for fun' and not for loot... I'd genuinely be surprised if that was the reason the majority of players here went to dungeons.
---
Me and my friends are basically holding all gold that we make from group grind (we split profits from certain farms) until my one friends share is 800
---
I ranked up when I don't think I should have... does that count?  I bought my armor as soon as the servers came up in case it was a mistake and I get knocked back down again.
---
Well toxic a word that has officially lost all meaning.
---
People want to play on unbalanced servers. Just unbalanced in a favor that advantages them.
---
My main is on a private server, scrub
---
We love premade vs premade, but we can't have that all the time and compete with the ranking system.  I would rather have rated BG's, but this is vanilla, so whatever, we stomp pugs 90% of the time and get 1-2 good games a day.
---
Now there's going to be haven servers where the balance is actually reasonable being swayed hugely in 1 direction or the other.  It's not going to create less imbalance, it's going to make the current imbalances worse and the current balanced servers unbalanced.
---
People in here acting like blizzard is Satan. This was literally a thing in Vanilla WoW I hope people do realize this.
---
Yeah, I haven't lost all hope yet. Plus there are a few extra hints that I'm hoping someone will pick up on which should help them figure it out. My character is a dwarf and is named after a dwarf, my pet bear is named Beorn after the guy who can transform into a bear from The Hobbit, and I have a macro that I use sometimes when entering melee combat that just does "/y Baruk Khazâd! Khazâd ai-mênu!" which is a Khuzdul battlecry that Gimli uses in The Two Towers. Although I'm guessing whenever anyone sees that in chat they just assume it's scrambled messages from the other faction.
---
The fucking idiots did it, found a way to ruin it

If you have two accounts, you can

"no one ever mentioned it." Must be hard to play without eyes and ears, congrats on making it this far.

Huh, thanks for the tip, I'll save my stones in the future :p
---
Just getting our wins back from the first three days we let you have free reign.
---
Druid scratched the itch for me. I can do my stealth assassinations, save the day with a clutch heal, take charge and tank, or just start blasting with moonfire, all from a single character!
---
PvE Servers are gonna get BIG.
---
This is now a Biff Tannen-level shitshow.
---
It can't be said enough, how the hell would you crunch numbers to calculate win % when we can't even do that shit 15 years later?  Nothing like that existed then, later, or even now.  If you thought it was real...  Idk what to tell you.
---
Can you transfer to a different account on the same realm?
---
Gear doesn't exist for any class/role in 40-man Raids. Once you lose that expectation, it becomes a lot easier. Also, Druids are not real classes since they are actually Unicorns.
---
It's not a dick move to nab the quest first, though. When multiple people are waiting for a mob, a limited quantity recipe vendor, a quest giver, etc.. it's a free for all. There's no social convention requiring you to wait. OP gave him a chance to mitigate the risk by grouping but when he refused he took the risk that he was competing for the quest giver.
---
There's currently a rumor that 4 skeram alliance guilds are planning to transfer to my server.  Not going to say it here, but you can PM me if you want more info.
---
Big if true.
---
Blizz isn't gonna care about balance, they're gonna care about that $25 you pay so you can actually play the game, on top of the $15 a month you pay.
---
I like this post for the same reason I love instant ramen. It's extra salty.
---
Am I missing something? Wowhead shows the only reward for exalted rep is the +5 all resistances to shoulder? That seems..... not worth it...
---
It's weird that you were ever considering removing these. They consistently have over 400 comments and having them makes your jobs a lot easier. What was the thought process behind removing them?
---
Flamelash
---
&gt; To me, it reeks of someone desperate to latch on to something that might get them a freebie. Like someone throwing a fit in a fast food restaurant.
---
Is anyone asking for anything? Its like probably less than 25c of sub time. Its 2019, a new patch hit, and blizz (the small indie company that it is) cant handle downtime in under 8 hours. Thats funny. Its worth talking about. 
---
And instead of just moving on, you gotta make sure we all know that you think its not worth talking about. Like ok, cool. I guess.
---
Eh. The dude in that vid is in great gear and is getting healed out the ass. Sure, you don't need a shield when raiding if you're in full t1 and have t1 healers.
---
Thanks for that. Got it figured out but slightly different. I had to alt click in my character screen. Whenever I did it in the itemrack menu it would just set the item to "hidden" for itemrack.
---
I'm pretty sure it levels them all up.
---
Playing the game and getting HKs while also completing objectives is the "best" honor.  Sitting AFK in AV won't get you shit because every person that is actually doing something is getting MORE honor than you sitting AFK.  You'll still sit at rank 1-3 because you aren't getting MORE honor than people at your rank who are actively getting kills and more honor.
---
Sounds like you took it the wrong way tbh
---
Ty friend
---
you're wrong about the ratio and horde population isn't the reason why you're struggling (and will struggle) to find new recruits
---
I agree, doing nothing is the wrong move. I just see people putting forth broad changes that wouldn't happen unless Classic+ happened, which is 110% wishful thinking right now.
---
Yes, alliance are really bad at PvP it turns out and they have no interest in adapting like they told horde to. Horde adapted.
---
Sir, this is Wendy's
---
Maybe on most servers as a horde player. But you have to put in 20 to 30 mins of extra time every time you want to visit brd ubrs lbrs as alliance on most servers. Its gotten a litle better with bgs but you definitely dont get the same with the same effort
---
No. You can get rank 14 without leaving stormwind
---
Yeah I wondered the same thing. I even auto followed the mage for a while just to make it look less suspicious, but after getting rubbed off on terrain a few times I just went back to auto following myself.
---
Jennnaaaaay*
---
Asking the important questions.
---
My server was 50/50 before then they opened up transfers and now sits 70/30.
---
So I don’t entirely agree with your logic.
---
Wait, what happens if your PVP realm goes PVE?  Can you transfer back to PVP?  Because the 1 restriction I'm aware of is that you can't go to a PVP realm if you're on a PVE.
---
I hate it when they dangerously cut you off, just to get that extra 20ft ahead of you. Then you see them weaving in and out of lanes ahead of you, until eventually you come to a stoplight, and the guy is a whole two car lengths ahead of you for all his effort. Was it really worth it?
---
I've also learned about missing my turn, that I can just turn later, and it's not worth being "that guy" just to delay one or more lanes of traffic for your own mistake. In fact, I try to make as many right turns in my route as possible. It's not only safer, but less stress. Sometimes it's longer, but I'd rather take an easier path and relax, than a shorter but more stressful one.
---
Annihilator armor shatter sticks, but gutgore ripper debuff won't stick. Like even if there are 0 debuffs on boss gutgore will proc but debuff won't land and can't push off anything. It's essentially immunity. The part I haven't confirmed is if lobo debuff works the same way as gutgore ripper, or if it works like annihilator. I supposed we will find out soon now that people are hitting av exhaulted and lobo is available.
---
More like 80:20 by my own numbers.
---
Every fight is the same - people put so much energy in the beginning arguing over galv+lts versus drek rush that they somehow fail to realize that people pulling the entire war room at drek is what consistently wipes the raid (if they wait for RH cap, they just pull the warmasters back to the spawn point to ensure horde can re-cap).  I'm not sure why this is an alliance exclusive problem though...
---
Do we know for sure yet if all of the exalted rewards (bracers, legs) will be released in p3 as opposed to p6? Seems like conflicting info on Wowhead versus atlas loots.
---
Forward slash // is how you ignore formatting in Reddit.

Blue seems to be the one always crying, I’m horse and I’m enjoying the game to it’s fullest

Literally nothing you can say to me will ever affect me.

I’m also from Wondseeker
---
I don't think classic has any premade detection built into matchmaking.
---
lmao, of course. I don't want to know how much I've spent on subscriptions, transfers, and faction changes over the years.
---
Yes, premading AV is the best honor, and everyone on our server does that.  AFK AV is STILL better honor than playing WSG, and that is sad and dumb.
---
oh wow, that's actually a really stupid point you just made!
---
Touchè
---
Transfers were opened a couple hours ago and magically a fifth of your server has moved?
---
Heartseeker. Trust me I’m horde on it
---
for about 2 weeks I stick to one and level them 5 to 10 times. Then I either start feeling like playing another class, or leveling other proffessions. between levels 20 and 37 with 4 characters. A warrior, a rogue, a shaman, and a warlock. Probably going to start playing my hunter and get him to mid 20s soon. If you aren't like this as an altaholic you're a FRAUD.
---
Im sure downvotes are coming... 
---
I’m in the minority, but I’m glad about this. I regretted rolling on a PvP server and with my limited playtime I do have and not being 60 yet, I was basically having entire nights wasted by griefers camping me all the time. I stopped logging in pretty much. I didn’t want to put in all that time to catch up to where I’d already gotten - I felt attached to my character and I am 5 levels from 60. People said “just dungeon grind” - I started doing that and literally getting into BRM and getting going took an hour minimum every time... No exaggeration. Don’t have a lot of playtime, felt like it was getting wasted, would rather just quit then reroll on pve and start over. 
---
I’m 100% moving to a pve server. I love to pvp, but I want to do it on my own terms. I understand why so many people are upset due to the faction balance issue, but the game already became completely broken in balance aside a few servers and perhaps selfishly, I am now interested in returning to classic and I know a lot of my friends feel that way too.
---
I'm interested to know where you actually got that information.
---
The classic who can out petty who story
---
the one shadow priest who rolled on my healing boot in DM:north ended up on my ignore list pretty darn quick.
---
that was the only time a non-healer rolled on healing gear without asking me first.
---
Yup just today
---
Fury warriors have the easiest and most predictable gearing curve of all DPS specs aside from Warlock and Hunters, and hunters have a way harder time than DPS warriors to find raidspots. You can right now get 7-8 pieces of gear that can easily last you until classic is over, and several of your pieces that are BiS/close BiS throughout the game are BoEs which you can farm. In AQ/Naxx pretty much all warriors will be in BiS/close BiS gear.
---
Free transfers were opened for awhile. Just close recently, have you been under a rock?
---
Of course it is.  Did you really think the alliance was better at pvp?
---
Why u have a sad face, pvp is fun
---
I don't even blame Blizzard for milking this cow, God damn was this some easy money
---
&gt;So please, I'd love to hear how you fix faction imbalance at this point without effectively punishing people or relying on average players making a massive time investment again.
---
It depends on how far you want to go. I've heard private servers that can go really far (introducing dual spec just for Alliance in example). Would that be welcome in Classic? I remember an official poll ran by Blizzard months before the beta even started that had some outlandish questions, so I wonder. 
---
&gt;That isn't incentivizing playing the other side, its just penalizing you for playing the overpopulated faction.
---
Many of the changes done during the years have done nothing but penalize people who play on the underpopulated faction or server. No advantages for low pop servers due to sharding, no real advantage for playing Alliance and so on. So why is it a concern to penalize the overpopulated faction? Not everything should be advantages
---
&gt;The reason they've never done anything hands-on about imbalance is because there's no way to do it without creating even more problems. 
---
They have done it though. They added Blood Elves to the Horde, they added Paladins to the Horde (still more popular class than shaman) and they have nerfed EMFH a million times. When they nerf an overpowered Horde racial, they actually buff it due to gameplay design changes. There is also the Mercenary Mode that directly contradicts Ion's reasoning for no cross-faction grouping. 
---
&gt;On another note, people are far too concerned with "server health". I've been around for a long time, I get the appeal. But people need to face the cold reality that server community died ages ago and Classic didn't bring it back. Maybe it exists on some smaller servers, but denying people the freedom to go to better environments or seek out more fitting guilds to protect the outliers is bad design.
---
Server health is not just about server community. It's a mix of overall population and faction balance. This affects all aspects of the game: Economy, PVE, PVP and then, a part of it, which is server community.
---
I'm not saying there are easy fixes, but faction imbalances and low pop servers have no advantages have been growing for years and Blizzard have decided to do nothing except very small attempts (an achievement, seriously?). They must not see this as a problem, because you could at least **start** to fix it. It has taken years to get to the really bad point it is now (although it already started during TBC), so perhaps there's no going back anymore.
---
and fewer bracket spots for them all to fit in
---
I'm guessing you're horde, because the horde have one too but it's unreachable.
---
Sounds like a change to me
---
I think what you aren't understanding is that it's an extremely odd intuition to have. The game gives you a token and you're immediate sense as a player is to use it. It doesn't make sense that the formula would change without indication. I think everyone understands that information is available on wowhead but this optimization mentality you're preaching is not intuitive to players and hence the meme

Oh you sweet summer child

97 is the number of times he was dropped as a baby.

I am going to earthfury, I started a twink there and I really like it so far....
---
Sure its important for some people, but 99% dont craft their own gear and +5 is Not important in Most cases aswell. You never Need that +5 for cap. Not saying its bad, just dont saying for new people that think exalted is something they need
---
Perfect timing. 30-60 has so much overlap horde vs alliance.
---
Not gonna happen
---
I was going to say "lucky!" but then I remembered the accident part. Sorry my man hope you get better.
---
&gt;if they didnt want us to do this, why else would they of added portals into a fucking battleground??!?
---
FYI, the horde one is unreachable.
---
I was horde on that server. Leveled with LFG KFC and raided with Company of Wolves.  Good times.
---
Can you please drop your windfury totem, it's what you're here for. Thanks!
---
- melee who actually does damage.
---
Blaumeaux server used be 50/50.
---
It’s easily 70/30 now.
---
They opened up free transfers and like five biggest alliance guilds dipped.
---
So wait does curse if recklessness hurt or help the quest?
---
The Ony buff warning is fairly accurate. You have about 25sec to get in Org after someone turns in the quest and the NOC starts walking.
---
However, Warchiefs Blessing comes out almost instantly. If you aren’t online when it comes out, you aren’t going to get it. But for some reason DBM gives a long ass 45sec timer. We usually have someone camping by Thrall and checking out any lvl 55+ that walks up. Any that walk up, we ask if they are turning in and if they can wait a minute so we can get people ready.
---
I seriously hope you didn't take Tuesday off with the intention of playing. If you just happened to have it off, that's better. But I wouldn't schedule my life around the infamous Blizzard timetraveling maintenance.
---
Are you legit comparing **free** transfers which were in response to **queue times** to **paid** transfers for no reason other than server balance?
---
Does anyone know how this warning works?  What triggers it in DBM?
---
A warlock will lifetap until a rogue is just smiling ear to ear waiting for hp to go lower....lower.
---
Me neither bro
---
It's Reddit, no one reads the article. Even when posting an article.
---
I see what you did there.
---
Paid transfer weren’t entirely for queue times.
---
This is the way.
---
Being able to find dungeon or raid groups, items on AH, world pvp. ??
---
It also makes you immune to fear.
---
Golemagg
---
whats the client thingie that updates all your addons? help! mine are out of date xD
---
I don’t think that Shamans-Paladins would be that game breaking. I guess the real fear would be that shaman players would not want to make that change and that they’d quit if their guild left or something. Hell, you could let shaman players reroll to a class of their choosing at level 60 if they faction-changed. 
---
Take their character’s gear and they get a mix of dungeon set and tier 1 for the given class that they pick. 
---
War-mode and changes to sharding have also made it significantly better for the alliance. Head to the call to arms zones for the week and they’re often a bloodbath with multiple groups from both factions farming the weekly. I had little to no issues doing world quests on an alliance alt, and I’d see as many alliance as horde while out doing emissaries. 
---
Every classic PvP server is slowly going to become 90-10 in favour of one faction or the other if blizzard isn’t there with their thumb on the scale. 
---
Even the ones that are 50/50. 
---
We’ve seen this already, with near 50:50 servers falling to shit in phase 2 and becoming 60:40. 
---
They aren’t going to get better, they’re just going to get worse. 
---
So the options are: 
---
1) positive incentives
---
2) negative incentives
---
3) 90:10 servers 
---
I think positive incentives are the way to go. Retail has showed us that the required incentive lies somewhere between +25% bonus gold/AP and heroic raid loot, they just need to find that sweet spot for classic.
---
Lol there's adds on rag? Just does faster??
---
I wish they’d take faction balance into consideration. Like, if faction imbalance percent differential is more than 10 or 15, it does not allow you to transfer to that server if your faction is overpopulated on that server.
---
Weird, never seen them.

Plenty of people have lost their virginity in 20 seconds.
---
Every single MMO that was ever worth a shit has been about time management being the #1 factor in getting the things you want. This one is just ultra hardcore mainly because of the makeup of the population you're playing a 15 year old game with, and because of the level of quality these items are compared to everything else currently in the game.
---
For alliance it's much shorter. It is triggered when somebody in your guild with addon is in SW when the head is handed to the npc and he  shouts out then a short timer starts on dbm
---
I am not totally sure on this myself. I think if neither side is defending, the alliance are able to take out the horde boss faster due to the route there being shorter for our side and maybe our advantage in PVE content. When we won, we usually took the graveyard but we didnt really need it if no horde were defending. We always pulled the adds outside and killed them a few at a time and then went all inside to get Drek.
---
Isnt it harder on low pop?!
---
So why would somebody not bring 40 people: 
---
a) they want more loot for their group and therefore bring less people-this wouldnt apply here imo since if youre having trouble with bosses, loot would be secondary and you'd bring as many people as possible to avoid wipes
---
b) you cant find enough people (maybe you have a small guild and dont want to pug or cant since you have a bad reputation, you play on a low pop server or you raid during inactive server times) - 
---
-all of these could have been avoided, maybe with the exception of low pop which is a real bummer (hey, at least we have paid trasfers now) 
---
Week 6 seems reasonable, it problably depends on your loot luck and how early you got all the douses
---
FYI, he's account sharing.
---
Paid transfer has nothing to do with queue times.
---
Sad face for people who want to stay on a PVP server, but might end up getting screwed by the faction imbalance that paid transfers cause.
---
Cannon guy in strat luve and last guy in BRD as well
---
&gt; the one shadow priest who rolled on my healing boot in DM:north ended up on my ignore list pretty darn quick.
---
Fair enough, you are entitled to ignore whoever you want for any reason whatsoever.
---
But honestly though, he likely did need the item and planned on using it (I can't say for certain, he may have DE'd or vendored it), the same way that you did, so they should have been entitled at a shot for it. 
---
&gt;that was the only time a non-healer rolled on healing gear without asking me first.
---
Must vary then, I saw this happen all the time on my mage while leveling. I don't think I ever saw anyone kick up a massive fuss, usually a comment or a depressed reaction, but no one was ever salty enough to add them to the ignore list... I think that's pretty childish to be honest.
---
Ok this is so absurdly shitty to do to a person that I couldn’t help but laugh. I’m sorry buddy.
---
My advice is to confirm for sure with a spreadsheet in rogue discord I linked. I believe if you have aclg+lobo OH it is within 1 dps of using NS gloves+dd OH. DD is almost always the goto bis until you have a CHT+(aclg or muggers belt). Depends on gearing and whats available to you.

Oh wow okay...  So yeah,  it triggers when the head gets handed in???

Does anyone know how long it takes for the buff to be deployed once someone hands in the quest for the head spike in Ogrimmar?

And paladins should get crusader strike which has 100% crit chance and buffs all party members +100 of their primary stat and stacks.
---
You can port your main with one account too. Just make the port then log over
---
I'm not saying don't warn, it's the polite thing to do. I'm saying that a majority of druids end up healing. And with the usual shortage of tanks, it's easier to gear up by tanking. If a healer is keen on rolling uncontested, they should be grouping up with a warrior.
---
he will first collect some gold, but I'm not sure if he really will transfer to a pve realm, probably more to a alliance dominated pvp realm ;)
---
&gt;Server factions were decently balanced at launch.
---
50% more Horde than Alliance in all first (pre-release), second (hours before release) and third generation (released during first two days) PVP servers is not balanced. The only ones that are not like this are the 4th and 5th generation servers, the ones created to allow free transfers into.
---
That’s exactly why I picked it at first—no one else was playing them. Feral and Balance were utter garbage back then as well, so I leveled to 60 as Resto.
---
1 mil honor doesnt seem that much to me for a week? I started doing AV 2 days ago and Im now at around 200k doing it solo with normal sleep, getting stuff for christmas etc.
---
Absolutely. There is a reason to go for exalted, just like there is a reason to have max enchanting with all recipes. Only one guildy needs that +30 spell damage enchant or crusader. Every other person is optional.
---
Complete the Xmas event to kill the grinch, you get a present at the end and it can contain one of like 5~ recipes (Enchanting, Alchemy, Engine, Smithing, LW)
---
It's been giving you that rep behind the scenes the whole time it just didn't notify for some reason. I only noticed when I got exalted with Darkspear while turning stuff in then started watching. By the time I hit exalted with Frostwolves I was over 3k into revered with Darkspear
---
Get in with someone got for the SGC to get your belt, get in on some jump runs for money to buy your of frozen wrath pieces off the AH (and riptide boots are mad ok, the neck is better than nothing), and find some friends who are running strat and scholo for some other pieces (dagger and wand from scholo, neck from strat and a shot at the cape).  
---
Having a guild helps a bunch here so you don’t have to put tanks as often.
---
Ahh good to know about Warchiefs Blessing, thanks.
---
the only working option I've found so far is WeakAuras 2 using [this](https://wago.io/RDC5y57BB)
---
"My you're a HUNG one"
---
How much does it cost?
---
It’s more about rep/the spirit of winning, if horde wanted max honor they would do like first 2 days and kill LTs and Belinda for that 3.8k bonus honor in an 8 minute loss. Even with a 10m que, 3.8k every 18 minutes vs ~4.2k-ish every 40 minutes including que (most my averages are 30m now if alliance dont zergrush victory)
---
One game our whole team went to Belinda first and wiped the horde. Then we went to Glav and killed him. Then back to Belinda and wiped the horde again. Then down to Drek and won the game in 18 mins. Seemed to work really good but I haven't been able to get a group to try it again.
---
We are already in Classic+, anyone denying it is living in lala-land. Consider the following:
---
Servers and infrastructure is modern WoW. Because the underlying framework is modern WoW, there are potentially hundreds of random small behaviors that are not consistent with Vanilla.
---
Spell batching is the biggest visible effect of above.
---
Am i the idiot for not realizing you can roll horde and alliance on the dame server in classic? They allowed that on the reboot? I thought back in the day you couldnt do that
---
When Exodar rep was released in 2.0, I grinded to exalted in AV and it wasn't too bad. So I had an elephant mount day 1 BC. Rep goes way faster when everyone does the turnins
---
That's not what OP was referring to.
---
They meant no **faction** limitations like the last round of free transfers had in order to prevent minority factions from fleeing.
---
Exactly... I thought I was going to make bank with all the ones I saved. I felt like wow spit in my face when I turned them in.
---
Damn, I didn't realize it started at such a low level like that. I really need to give Alliance a chance just for the lore.
---
Well that would be quite an assumption. I will continue to play the priest into BWL and beyond as I enjoy healing, but does it still have to be my main?
---
My main could end up being my warlock and have no raiding gear at all. Hopefully that’s ok with this sub reddit. 
---
And another assumption that the gear would have been given to anyone else. We have 3 priests in total and can’t seem to recruit anymore.
---
Went on my 37 druid yesterday for the first time in a while, within 5 minutes a gnome mage killed me, I alt f4'd. Came back an hour or so later, ran back to my corpse, within 5 minutes a different gnome mage killed me. Ngl I'm not resubbing, I'm just not having fun.

Made two accounts so the dude is paying over $30 a month just to look stupid

just saw some guy with over 1 mill honor from last week and hes champion (rank 10) no way I can outhonor some of these players
---
Because half the shit eve players used to do before ccp fucked the game up gets you banned in most mmos.
---
I mean take griefing for instance, like 95% of organized pvp in eve is literal griefing with the goal to make other players stop logging in. Doing the same in wow is a ban. Ninja looting, scamming, being intentionally toxic to other groups is pretty much the cornerstone of eve.

God I miss eve before ccp decided to drive that game off a cliff.

---
Okay.. Okay. Could I just have a Frosty and a baked potato please.
---
Except this wouldnt change anything I said since a) offhands are meaningless and b) mace specialization didnt crit more. If anything, those changes better benefited Swords (and axes/polearms) since more attacks = more chance to crit. Yet still, Mace stun was absolutely dominant (&gt;99%) amongst gladiator warriors. The kill potential of a 3s stun was too much
---
I think I get the sentiment, but you seem to be ascribing the label of *myth* to anything that's a *concept,* which I'd disagree with.
---
I believe morality is relative, but I'd argue that *myths* get in the way of us finding mutually shared moral axioms, subjective as they may be, rather than assist in this process.
---
&gt;believe in the existence of laws, justice, human rights = and the money paid out in fees.
---
Laws, for example, are a very real concept, though subjectively derived.  If you violate a law, you can be punished by the collective for said violation. Human rights are also subjective, but by agreeing upon what constitutes a human right, we can enforce it.  However, a *myth* can be universally believed to be true, one can be punished for claiming to not believe in it, and yet, this does not make it true.
---
It's the difference between stating *this is the way things are* (without providing evidence to support it) versus, *these are norms which would be beneficial to adopt for the sake of a well-functioning society.*
---
Want some pepper with that salt?
---
Now that the WpVp problem has been solved with Bgs. Blizz will sell you a solution anyways.

hahaha, that is amazing!  I love people that are willing to throw away a shitload of gold to troll, the more value an item has the more epic the troll!
---
What about it? I just said you can chase them off there
---
Same,  I was rank 4 and did did AV for rep and kept going semi-hardcore and ended up in bracket 11 so im now close to 6.   If I can just make a big push and land solidly in bracket 12 this week i'll have rank 7 and I'll stop there since the next thing i'd even want is in rank 10 which is going to be more effort than i want to put in.   I'd rather level alts.
---
Basically this honor system is AIDS.   It's so bad...  I wish AB was out or at least Warsong Exalted rewards because other than rep rewards and doing it for fun the PVP honor system is garbage,  by far the worst part of classic.   And the rewards are so disproportionately not worth it over other content in the game.   BWL/ZG Gear will outpace all but the HWL weapons for most classes.   Also rank 9 is just straight up bullshit garbage.    Rank 9 should be shoulders/helm, and rank 10 should be blue weapons.
---
I wasn't a big fan of the whole #nochanges thing because there were necessarily going to be changes,   i wish this was one of them to give more people a reason to pvp and to make it less about just day after day grinding....
---
Put in the TBC pre patch honor system IMO.
---
I thought weapon procs like that were low enough priority that they were basically a minor inconvenience at worst? Is that wrong? Would be nice to know before I run into a raid with lobo, lol.
---
Yea.. i did the av thing. Interestingly there was more pvp in Retail Event AV then there is in Classic.

---
4 hours a day is hardly casual. I also ranked up to 10 back in vanilla playing "casually", but it also took many months to do so. This just speaks to why it's hard to achieve. 4 hours of pvp a day to the average WoW player in 2005 was a lot. Now the average WoW classic player considers it casual. This is why ranking up is slow going. You're competing against a much more hardcore community.
---
Curse of Recklessness makes you immune to fear. The demon does a constant 600 damage "deathcoil" that fears you for 6 seconds
---
Maybe it was just the people in your circle that didn't know.
---
There is no spirit of winning.  They aren't there to win, they're there for the rewards (in whatever form of currency is FOTW).
---
The amount of honor you get is also irrelevant.  If all of the Alliance get, say 500 a game, then it is no different than if all of the Alliance got 10,000 a game.  It is still compared to everyone else on your faction, all of whom are getting the same amount per game.
---
The Alliance don't want to stop the "rush drek" strat, because in their minds it worked one time, so it should always work.  They're just dumb.
---
I remember finishing one of the HoT meta events and was looting boxes when I thought I was hearing things. Sure enough, there was a group of people playing “Never Gonna Give You Up” on harps.  It made my day.

Look, to be fair... I may have smoked a joint before writing that comment so I lost my way. I apologize, dear stranger.

This is a lie, I transferred from a pvp server to another pvp server doing free transfer moves. All my honor which was calculated already moved with me. You are right if you honor grind on Tuesday/Wednesday and transfer in Thursday, then your honor you got before it calculated on Tuesday will not follow. So if you transfer, do it after a Tuesday and no honor will be lost
---
Yeah it was purely due to server pop. However the highest pop vanilla servers would actually get two HWLs a week but nothing back then approached the size of Classic Servers
---
Does faction play any part in this currently? I got a Horde Priest I'd love to move and change to Alliance as I rerolled months ago. Just sitting there at Lv 60 currently.

You want to encourage your healers to heal. You want to stick near your healers and protect them.  
---
During the beginning zerg, you can have your slow mount alliance run further right and go around snowfall graveyard if the horde try to cut them off. This usually gives them a path around to get to Galv and stay with the group.  
---
Make sure to cap FWGY and have alliance ghost run south if they need to. Be careful not to rush towards Drek too soon, or you risk losing too many alliance that then have to ghost run back to FWGY.
---
Why did they remove DestroyTotem and GetTotemInformation from the public API without listing it in the patch notes, or giving any indication they'd do it?  Who knows.  They're winging this shit.  I'm sure the devs didn't want to make changes that completely screw over the player base.  The business side said "optimize money, we actually want classic to die before Shadowlands comes out anyway."

Sure but casually putting in 5 hours a week raiding/farming/pvping has nothing to do with being forced to pay someone in China to play for you when you sleep.

That's how all the HWLs on my vanilla server ranked. They'd literally be on 16 hours a day, then they'd logout and they wouldn't respond to you because they only knew Chinese.

I'm alliance playing with a large premade discord server(100-200 people queuing together). I've been doing this constantly since release, one session playing over 60 AV games. I'm having a great time TBH. The premades are generally organized, communicate strategy well, and have a very high win rate. To elaborate on the win rate in the session where I played over 60 games I lost 2.
---
Can confirm, server feels generally balanced. I've enjoyed my time here.
---
Not just MC though, pre raid bis dungeon gear to get to mc in the first place. That was for all practical purposes impossible to do on my server during the period between bgs and the release of honor.
---
Also on Incendius Alliance. Pretty solid server.

True story.  Might make WSG and AB exalted as long term goals, which take a ton of time, but at least not in a fashion where you compete against everyone else to sell your life with the threat of decay.
---
its pretty fckin bad when the groups new or bad
---
Just drown it with custard, thats what I do irl with fruitcakes.
---
I haven't noticed dropped attacks ...
---
you can't transfer to Faerlina, thank god
---
Faerlina is about to double in pop.  Who knows what kind of shit fest it'll have now.  It's going to cause a server fire, burning down the building and literally killing classic.
---
Is bwl hard? People in my guild are freaking out. I know it's gonna be harder than mc but that's not really saying much. If everyone is in discord and geared it should be easy right?
---
I got got
---
If a druid is tanking, I wouldn't expect them to roll over the healer in the group on healing items. If a druid is healing, I wouldn't expect them to roll over the tank on tanking items. It's fine to roll for offspec if and only if no one else in the group needs on their main spec. 
---
Saying "let me roll on all loot because I have 3 specs" is selfish and also is a good reason for people to be pissed off at you.
---
I never hate Alliance half as much as I hate Horde that tag the mobs I need lol.
---
Aaaaand there’s faction transfers lol
---
Hope incendius holds strong.
---
So most people just go in blind and do zero research before doing anything at all? Hours of grinding something just... GOOD LUCK, ME!
---
Go buy a car? Just go to a dealer and just be like “that one yes good”
---
Want a new phone? We’ll figure it out when we get there! 
---
No, I think normal people do a modicum of research before doing anything that takes a moderate amount of time.
---
They really answered his “call to arms”....
---
That's not the really problem.  The real problem is the ones close to balance will swing way off now.
---
They type /who warrior 60 and just start whispering
---
this applies to almost all rep factions, save your turn in items for revered + phase (possibly quests too), same with timbermaw, no one mentions it that the more u progress the worse it becomes
---
In later phases they will unlock recipes, gear and enchants and also it will give you free entry to naxxx instead of paying gold every time to enter
---
But like.. for whatever reason, they still CHOSE to play on a PVP server
---
Of course they would if they cared about the health of the servers.
---
Name exactly one change to MC between 1.11 and 1.12.
---
You're just wrong.
---
I want your gear
---
It matters for world bosses and desireable resource nodes or farming spots.
---
“A quick scholo” lmaoo
---
if you think about it for literally 15 seconds, you will realize that its impossible for it to make anything better, and a guarantee that it will make things much worse.
---
Gz to blizzard on all the cash. We're still not gunna play Shadowlands after you intentionally kill classic
---
Did Swifty go to Anathema so he could have an easy ride?
---
That's what I'm saying though, people would say that a feral druid shouldn't be healing though or a resto shouldn't be feral, if you get my drift. It's the normie society in WoW Classic that makes the rules, not me.
---
I think he meant resilience
---
my main spec is a hybrid spec.
---
You play horde, right?
---
Lol bullshit. Guilds, by there very nature, have an established set of rules. In fact, Blizz will sometimes intervene if a set of looting rules that were established in-game aren't followed. 
---
You don't owe anything to a rando waiting for the same quest as you who refused to group.  It's entitled as hell to expect you to wait when he refused to group for a quest with a timed respawn.  That's like saying you should wait in line to grind a small number of quest mobs until whoever was there first gets all their drops.
---
In a similar boat. Rolled horde warlock. Fully bis from mc/ony. Found out my old vanilla guild is elsewhere as alliance. I dislike my server and really want to reroll there but I cant bring myself to do a second warlock.
---
lvling is significantly eaiser when u have gold and locations are not filled with ppl as they were in 1st month, also giving that you already done most quests, you know exactly what to do and you remember much more how to do stuff
---
It's not time limited. You can start planning now.
---
this is fucking great
---
unregulated and so early? Tbh, no.
---
I deserve to be punished for have any faith in this company, ggs
---
Those people are called "Hunters".  Their aggressive pets and drool covered keyboard give then away.
---
Bli$$ard
---
We need a "salt" flair
---
doesn’t this just punish the guy for filling the missing role so that the group can go do the dungeon instead of sitting in LFG for another half hour? it doesn’t make sense.
---
I mean this in all seriousness - is wpvp even that big of a deal now that BGs are out?
---
Honestly I just think the cold invites are rude. At least whisper me and wait for a reply before you invite. If they do that they just get a no thank you.
---
BWL requires better gear and a bit more co ordination than MC, but I figure most guilds will have it on farm after a few weeks. 
---
One of the big things about Classic is that we have 1.12 itemization, so right now most mages in MC are getting like 300+ spellpower... When BWL initially came out I think my mage barely had like &lt;100 spellpower. People know what to do, the tricks, the DPS checks and what consumables to bring, so as long as everyone is prepared and coordinating on discord it should be a relatively easy process. 
---
It might not be easily puggable though, but we'll see as time goes on.
---
who the fk is Alex
---
Wal-Mart guilds? These shitshow have always been called cesspool guilds for a reason lol
---
of course they dont admit that they are just losers without a job.
---
Nah Pagle sucks. Transferred off there a few weeks ago when they allowed transfers off. Alliance side guilds are either (1) total trash that are only rolling on a PvE server because they can’t handle big boy servers or (2) elitist PvE-only guilds that have already have their permanent raid teams and aren’t recruiting anyone else that doesn’t want to use flasks on MC runs or donate mandatory 100g per week for the guild bank for god knows what. Like if you’re just a normal, semi-hardcore player that wants to do a little bit of everything there’s really nothing to do on Pagle. 
---
I’m over here on Westfall now and couldn’t be happier
---
Becoming Honored for the Insane title is a requisite and they also reward you with a pirate outfit and hat. As far as i know, there aren’t any quests or other benefits.
---
I’ve done this quest with a group of 3, two of us got the note pretty much immediately, one of us had to farm FOREVER for it. We thought the exact same thing, even submitted a ticket to blizz. Sometimes they just take a long while to drop
---
/&gt; See's someone playing the game
---
      
---
&gt;omfg you're doing it wrong, you're so douche.
---
Alliance seeking shelter should head over to Grobbulus, quite balanced but could always use some more Ally!
---
That's quite a knowledgeable guild! I've seen an average of 12-14 days /played for the guild I'm in.
---
Can't on flurry.  Too low ilvl.  You can use dense.
---
Horde have been adjusting to a much more defensive style. In general more horde stay at objectives to slow down Ally but there's been a huge increase in those staying at Drek and those teleporting back. I think the best way to counter this is smart and quick graveyard captures to send dead horde back to IBGY.
---
nothing, but a low pop realm wouldn't make ranking any easier.
---
for people that like pvp sure
---
Looks like Earthshaker for EU, but its only 58% alliance
---
Im usually playing premade and our fastest run was 6. Min. That run is about 3.5k honor. We kill all commanders/galv/drek (0 warmasters) and we control our own bunkers wich is 198 per (800) if we dont wast time in between and we dont meet turtles we can have 9 games an hour which is almost 30k
---
Its unrealistic, but possible
---
Dont really blame people for leaving. Server is done unless theres some huge influx of Alliance to take back the server.
---
Hope this doesn’t effect my 55/45 balanced server. If it does this might be the end of classic
---
Large tight-knit guilds would need to coordinate transfers to ensure their main raid groups are present and available on the new servers.
---
Shhh. Don't tell them.
---
....and this is the hill where a lot of PvP servers will die. 
---
Just history repeating.
---
Dual boxing while high? THAT'S ILLEGAL!
---
I tanked scholo like 20 times after turning 60 on my warrior. Been there, done that, collected all drops I could potentially use. I don't get anything from that place, why would I want to go there again?
---
I suppose it's a general problem in classic; most dungeons don't really give any reason to come back after you got the drops you needed.
---
Stormstirike has a 20 sec cd dude. Fuck off.
---
yes
---
i see you've read the top half, now read the bottom half
---
Every decision this company makes is motivated by greed and laziness.  It is very easy to predict how everything will pan out for classic if you apply that understanding.
---
If you tell people ahead of time, do whatever you want.
---
Surprising people by rolling on 3 gear sets over people who actually need that gear more as their main spec...that's rude.
---
I've rolled on OS gear many times, but I asked first and made sure the group was cool with it.
---
The idea was to encourage more questions and discussions as individual posts, rather than pushing all discussion into one giant thread. We also are concerned that the giant threads are nearly unsearchable via Reddit or Google, and it's unfortunate to lose so much good information due to Reddit's stacked formatting.
---
However, none of that really matters if people genuinely really prefer this method. So, we'll maintain it.
---
What are the disadvantages of Rogue Daggers vs Rogue Swords, in terms of leveling and PvE? The downsides of Swords seem pretty harsh considering it removes abilities from your toolkit, but people insist on Swords for both categories.
---
You might be able to get it restored to your account if you accidentally destroyed it then they usually have no issue giving it back to you. Did this with a quest item that I needed to complete this long ass quest chain, accidentally destroyed one of items they give you that you have to return back to them and then that deleted all the quest items and essentially I would have to do a lot of the quest over again. But I found the restore items page, they said as long as it's been less than 2 weeks (could be wrong there can't remember time restriction) since you had the item then they would restore it, put in request and got the item back 10mins later.
---
My guild in vanilla had bwl on farm with worse gear than we have now.  It's harder than mc but not that much. It's naxx and aq40 that gets hard.
---
It’s not a time sensitive issue...you can transfer today, tomorrow, or in 6 months.
---
Scholomance has a lot of preraid BiS pieces and the set in there is pretty strong for PvP and AoE farming as well. I think its a pretty good dungeon to spam and get familiar with.
---
Blizzard have said that they replicated the 1.12 version of the game world. (Mostly, obviously phase 1-2-3-4-5-6 are different and they can't all simultaneously be replicas of the game world. But mostly.)
---
Same if they attempt a conversation even if its just "hey wanna join" I'm not going to shit on them in their own guild chat.
---
yeah i still don’t even understand what this means. but i just talk to the group about it and in the worst case i like running dungeons so i don’t mind giving an item to somebody else who needs it and going again. so it hasn’t been a problem. it’s stupid, though.
---
If you do an organized push, 20 rankers can accomplish that themselves with lvl 10 alts.
---
There was a download when I logged on, well after maintenance because they've literally done it Tuesday's for 15 years and I expected it.  But my point is, this wasn't a normal one.  They patched something.
---
What happens at revered? Just hit that today
---
I think English may be a second language here and "minority" is a bad translation for "alt"
---
People chasing horde into dreks room. Pulling all the room with HoTs and wipung assault before relief hut is cappedm
---
can I interest you in a warfront challenge!
---
 but theres stuff missing what would have been in 1.12, not sure what the diff between that and what any p server would d is. the ones i played on did the same thing more or less
---
All the PvP alliance leavers who are leaving out of frustration of getting killed while questing or while minding their own business in their cities will be going to PvE servers, which are already heavily alliance.  So yeah PvP to PvE will just make all the already alliance dominated PvE servers even more so.
---
It's because even the game can't take the cringe of having your name be legolas. It left you alone as you deserve.
---
The best part is how none of you got any xp for a long time
---
Premade suggests there'd be more than 1 person with 1.1 mil.  Our top player was showing 1.1 mil on Monday with the closest to them at about 900k.  Also, this person is constantly in AV.  Like, literally all week long.
---
Me am that kind of orc
---
i came from the future and made another account
---
Fuck you
---
Good to see blizzard kept with tradition and fucked this game up
---
I don't think BWL will be particularly challenging after 2-3 weeks for guilds currently clearing MC in under 2 hours.  Players are significantly better now and the itemization in this version is better than when BWL was initially released.
---
This is a good plan, but still sounds like a zerg. Getting most of the group to FWGY is the hard part. Def a good idea to send the slow mounts further right. That is usually how they first break the zerg. 
---
If we can get zerg better to work I'm down, but they are good at cutting off the slow group and choking the rest on the way to FWGY.  Then its headless chicken time.
---
Imagine charging $25 for something that should be free. It’s the players fault that they need to abandon their servers because blizzard doesn’t know how to release a game.
---
According to [wowhead](https://classic.wowhead.com/faction=87/bloodsail-buccaneers), you get [a hat](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12185/bloodsail-admirals-hat) and some white clothes at friendly.  It also mentions an associated achievement at honored, but that's obviously not relevant to classic.
---
somewhere around 25sec at max I believe
---
Guild Wars 2 lets you transfer all characters for $10. But hey, it's blizzard.
---

I got a whisper from a lvl 58 priest who asked me to tank but I had to be full prot. Whispered him and told him I only run with 60 priests.
---
Shhhhh nooooo don't tell them
---
lol
---
More likely he doesn't want to visit any dungeons at all be it dps or tank role.
---
My bad, still funny.
---
Some ppl dont know this, but the drop rare in brd is pretty ehhh since only some of the mobs drop it near Arena. Kill the non elite slaves outside brd and youll get it in less than 10 kills
---
r/theydidthemathmoreaccurately
---
Bro you literally went into my post history to try to find something to troll me about. Don't go into any rivers bud, you might turn into an ocean with your salt levels.
---
Zerg is still the strat. You want to win before they win. And you don't want to drag out the game. But with more horde playing defense you have to slow down the zerg, else you wipe and are sent back to SHGY or worse.
---
Did you even try to understand his comment? Lol
---
It does sell well.
---
I think the only players who’ll consider it will be those after R14 and the ones truly determined to reach it are probably few in numbers. The mass exodus of players you’ll see will be those looking to switch to a more dominant/balanced faction or moving to a different category of realm (PvP/PvE etc.)
---
It’s true that PVP servers have a lot of griefing. Few people really like that part. 
---
What keeps me and others like me devoted to PVP servers is the unpredictability. I love how a random ganking can grow into a zone-wide battle complete with raids on bases. I love the slight apprehension every time you leave a base. BGs are fun but they lack that.
---
When you're an indie game company you need as much help as possible
---
I'm curious in the purpose of 4 priests, I kinda get having 1 of each spec but why 4? Asking as someone else playing Priest
---
Bartender and Neuron will both do that. Personally, I would recommend Neuron because it will give you more buttons than Bartender. But Bartender's documentation is better, you can update it with twitch, and it's a little more intuitive to set up. Neuron has a lot more power though.
---
Come to Smolderweb. Slightly balanced but a bit in horde favor. I am alliance and I wanna kill you
---
Halfaman , forgot guild names
---
I played alliance warlock on nostalrius, let me tell you brother, youre gonna be a master warlock if you can get around it. You just have to fight them differently. Grenades are good too, sleep dust, limited invulnerabilities, if you got the cash roll you can win.
---
once living action potions come out you can win much easier
---
they cheap shot
---
you break it, deathcoil, fear to get them to burn WOTF
---
then kite them for 5 seconds and sleep with a succubus, win.
---
dont you want to spend 2g to win?
---
My friends should be happy then.
---
It IS* a shitshow
---
where should i move to rank easier to 12 as horde?
---
Please commit against sulfuras, don't ruin our server like others by transferring multiple guilds
---
Dodgeseeker
---
and it will be awful during any of the events that require the world.
---
For starters, I would never in 10 million years roll Alliance PvP on a TBC realm. And I'll never play Horde.
---
That ties into one of your points: adding elves to the Horde. While it was done to shift population, I should have been more specific about what I meant by hands-on. I was referring to putting systems in place to encourage it, not balancing things/adding things in new expansions. I apologize. I'm trying to keep things as rooted in the framework of Classic possible since as far as we know right now, theres no plans for any new content. 
---
As for the Horde having their collective balls tongued on Retail, yes I agree its ridiculous. Which is why Blizzard basically threw up their hands and just made War Mode. They tried numerous things over the years like Blood Elves, Every Man For Himself, unrestricting Shamans and Paladins, etc etc and nothing ever really caused balance. It either took things too far or made a miniscule difference. Frankly I think factions should be done and dusted in Retail. The population imbalance makes recruitment a chore for Alliance and the lore no longer really supports factions. So in that particular context (Retail) just make the whole game mercenary mode. The point of no return was crossed ages ago there.
---
Regarding perks a la dual spec, maybe that would help a bit. But I would be hard pressed to believe many people would reroll just for that and the idea that we're gonna get so many new players in the future that it will even dent the imbalance is...well, lets just call that very optimistic.
---
Also fuck Ion. If you heard anyone booing him at Blizzcon, it was probably me. I tried to be as loud and obnoxious as possible. 
---
To your points about server health:
---
PvP is already dead and buried as a healthy part of the game. It was unfathomably cancerous pre-BGs and is mostly dried up now. Deck chairs, Titanic, etc.
---
PvE is much the same way. Most of the overpopulated servers are so hideously one-sided that players are sitting in queues on the minority faction to engage with a community of the same size as a balanced medium realm. Faction queues just share the misery if a 1:1 or 1.5:1 ratio is enforced. I'm sorry, but the megaservers are already broken beyond salvation. As I told people during the WPvP debacle, they aren't salvageable and even if they were, its not worth it.
---
Economy is an interesting point. We're still seeing the effects of layer exploiting and down the line it will still be fucked up by even small/medium realms having more people than the world can accommodate. So I'll concede this point to you with the caveat that that transfers just exacerbate an already horrible issue as opposed to creating one.
---
I was thinking about rolling on an RP server as horde as thralls bastard son.
---
Raid schedules are serious business for some people.
---
Yes, it was pretty clear.  Horde try to win now.  Before they just killed Bal and let the Alliance run over them.  Now they don't, and the Alliance can't be bothered to even try to win.
---
As long as you announce it before hand then its cool imo. I play HOTW/NS and have both full heal n tank set so i know how it goes. But just expecting to be able to roll on whatever without warning is just plain rude and will piss people off.
---
Thus the free transfers. Go to another server with better faction balance and no queues. And you don’t have to worry about being on the low pop faction after transfer, since all servers have balanced online population.
---
A frost mage with double iceblock is always going to be about outlasting the amount of burst they have in store. If you have low stam/survivability and/or they have insane amounts of damage  (gear, buffs, sheer luck) you will lose. Feldoggie is paramount to keep devouring their ice barriers. Spell locking their frost school would be ideal but a good frostmage will not be casting, as you've figured out already. This matchup is honestly about gear, or you being SL specced which will basically turns mages into easy mode.
---
Warriors are a question of gear too, if they are well geared and you're not you're gonna be shredded up like paper. Otherwise it's about wearing them down with draintank or burst, depending on your spec. With SM/ruin or SL I like to fakecast a drain life to bait their pummel, then draintank them. As nightfall/conflag I can usually just melt them in a DC + grenade.
---
Oh yeah, and if you have trouble with pvp, do grab engineering. It's extra strong on warlocks because we lack the tools that exactly that prof provides. I don't even use that much stuff from it; mostly grenades which are god-tier and the net trinket for catching people.
---
So take the free transfer to a server without queues. Balanced population servers will not have wait times.
---
Yeah, osrs in its infancy was fairly curated by the mods and community. With Blizzard is just feels like they flip a switch and don't care much for the community, which feels really bad to me. RS3 issues are a whole different beast though.
---
I just rerolled as Human Mage to a Gnome Mage. I’ll be playing Classic until they release TBC. So I thought fuck it, now is the best time to do it. (Just before BWL)
---
But do you understand it was better for the horde when they lost in 8 minutes?
---
More people are playing, but x-server and more frequently
---
But retail faction imbalance is just as bad or worse.
---
I don't get why people are so gung-ho about server health. It really feels like people clutching at a bygone era. Let the 90:10s exist, so long as people have a way off.
---
Is there any gear you can get from pvp at this point? Just started with pvp, probably got rank 1 this week. Still in my lvl 40s. Trying to remember back in original, there was a pvp trinket you could get pretty early on. What is there now?
---
You can buy a second account. Then, yes you can have both. Several people in my guild do this for various asshole type reasons
---
Any time I see the warning pop up or get a message from dbm from a guildie in town, you have about 5 seconds to respond. Seems buggy atm.
---
Killing guards stop giving out Rep (5), so turn in and especially victory gets a lot more important.
---

If any Alliance guilds are transferring Contact Onra#5748 about the guild coalition, here is our mission statement: [https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/131111738962739201/656615617075347486/SAP\_Discord.PNG?width=400&amp;height=242](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/131111738962739201/656615617075347486/SAP_Discord.PNG?width=400&amp;height=242)  
---
We are also recruiting exceptional players who have a community spirit.
---
Yeah that's the perfect take away. Use as little FR peices as possible by getting big-ticket FR boosts. Then mix in threat/mitigation as deemed fit. For your helmet definitely get the +20FR libram going for it, and also definitely do the Dark Iron Legs with Libram. The less peices you need to stack FR with the better, so having a few MASSIVE pieces turns the tide for better threat gearing. 
---
My personal FR set is Gyth's Skull of FR with Libram (38), Dark Iron Leggings with Libram (50), Cloak from UBRS with FR enchant (27), Dark Iron Bracers (18), then one Blazing Emblem Trinket (15) and one Flame Reflector (18).  Just by swapping in 4 items and 2 trinkets I get 168 FR alone.
---
 Now pair those few key items with my standard tank/threat items.. key items add minor FR.
---
Onyxia Tooth Chain (Threat) (10)
---
Gauntlets of Might (Tank+Theat) (7)
---
Shoulders of Might (Tank) (7+5 enchant)
---
Draconian Deflector (Tank) (10)
---
It might take time to build your "Master Set" that you create for yourself, but that's my go-to build for maximum FR and general tank mitigation. I had an item for every slot for maximum FR, then gradually balanced out the spread as real raid teir tank/threat pieces came in.
---
15% more XP is miniscule and provides no longterm benefit.
---
Whos gonna drop their geared 60s for that?
---
It’s called curse forge, google will help you with the right link!
---
If you want to tank and role as a healer...just tell the group that when they group with you.
---
I'm just clarifying that you shouldn't surprise the group.
---
Good on him for warning you first. He gave you the chance to leave if you didnt want to waste the time and aggravation. Obviously it didnt work out in his favor but none the less.
---
This is where I re-rolled to and it’s good.  Bringing my pvp characters over when I get home.
---
Faction change available? I want an undead epic mount lol
---
Battlegrounds are just more or less larger goal-oriented PvP instances. 
---
Warsong Gulch (WSG) is a big game of capture the flag, for instance. 
---
Alterac Valley (AV) is an odd sprawling map where the end goal is to win by killing the enemy general in his bunker. You have a full raid of 40 on each team.
---
It wouldn't hurt to look them up on wowhead or YouTube for a tour of them.  
---
WSG is available once you hit level ten and includes players from every level in a given bracket (10-19, 20-19, etc etc up through 50-59 and then level 60's are in their own bracket).
---
AV is 51-59 and then 60. 
---
The only thing to keep in mind is if you enter a bg when you're at the low end of a level bracket  you will get rolled pretty hard and won't be very effective against higher level enemies. Some people will be assholes about it, but it doesn't matter a ton.
---
You can queue at the battle masters in any city (castle in SW, military ward in IF for alliance and I've forgotten about Horde). Though the instance portals proper are on southern ashenvale/northern barrens for WSG depending on whether alliance or Horde, and in the Alterac Mountains for AV.
---
Is there a version in Papyrus?
---
All those NPCs with blue names, right?
---
Yeah from memory it was an oculus run in WOTLK.
---
Pagle has most alliance of any pve server I can see
---
You seem extraordinarily upset while reiterating exactly what I said before.
---
It's a dick move for a dick move.
---
Now, you can be a fucking little bitch about it and get more aggressive in nature and language, or you can man the fuck up, and realize that if anti-social behaviour is your forte, perhaps you shouldn't be playing an MMORPG.
---
Because there's a big difference between role-playing a psychopath, and being a fucking psychopath.
---
Who would actually WANT to transfer to faerlina? Lmao, I'm betting the person meant in the context of the exodus of people once people like asmongold transfer off the server, and the ally followers to follow
---
You can't have alliance and horde characters on a pvp server though? What am I missing here?
---
Doesn't even matter. I sometimes drew aggro just from being next to the person that died. No damage, no buffs, no interaction.
---
cool. thanks for the information.
---
It’s dodge and parry, but only 25%
---
What issue? Just leave the damn realm. 
---
I genuinely do not understand this fixation with server health and community. Health is already shot to shit on most PvP realms and community is a pie-in-the-sky for most people on megaservers.
---
I think it's 3 accounts. He logs on his 3rd account to sit by the lake and cry, after his ass gets handed to him.
---
ＨＥＬＬＯ &amp;nbsp; ＰＲＯＦＥＳＳＯＲ &amp;nbsp; ＦＡＬＫＥＮ
---
Yeah I was about the same.
---
The PVP trinket is Rank 2 and does not require a level.  Rank 3 gets you a cloak, Rank 4 gets you a necklace and Rank 5 gets you bracers.  All blue quality with level 40, 50 and 60 variations.
---
It's not though.  For the same reasons I've pointed out:
---
The amount of honor you get doesn't matter.
---
The amount of rep you get does matter, until you cap.  But even that isn't really relevant, because turn-ins give a shitload of rep, so long games are just fine for Rep.  Plus it makes rep completely worthless to you from that point on, so all you care about is honor, which is completely meaningless.
---
That I'm an Alliance Hunter.
---
&gt; If you tell people ahead of time, do whatever you want.
---
In general that's great advice and everyone should adhere to it, but from just about every single run I've been in this has not been the case. I'm honestly struggling to find a dungeon run in recent memory where someone said they would roll for OS before rolling on it, typically they just roll and there's never really any problems with that.
---
Hell I can't really remember any scenario where players got salty over someone rolling for their OS, one of my last UBRS runs on my mage had a druid tank roll need on Brairwood reed over 3-4 clothies and the only response was stuff like "damn grats". 
---
The last loot dispute I can remember is when a mage rolled on the +shadow damage mask in ZF over the priest/lock because it gave him more int than his previous helm, but even that didn't really cause much issue since it was an upgrade for the mage. 
---
&gt;Surprising people by rolling on 3 gear sets over people who actually need that gear more as their main spec...that's rude.
---
If characters are planning to use the item and actually need them, it shouldn't be considered rude that they roll for it. If a character wants an item for a meme spec or as a laugh, then that would be considered rude. But to actively need an item and plan to use it should be fair game whether it's part of their main spec or not. This feels like calling DPS warriors rude because they roll on leather/mail/plate, yet I've never seen someone complain ingame when a warrior rolls on TSS. 
---
But to genuinely need an item, work to get it to drop, then be denied because your role in the current dungeon was what the group needed at the time seems incredibly crass.
---
&gt;I've rolled on OS gear many times, but I asked first and made sure the group was cool with it.
---
Ideally everyone should do that, but from experience, this is simply not the case.
---
Leveling a mage from 1-60 I honestly didn't care too much about healer/tank/DPS gear or whatever since all I could use was cloth, in scenarios where a DPS warrior would roll on tank gear no one complained, in scenarios where a healing priest would roll on shadow gear, no one complained. Now that I'm a druid and rolling on OS it's become a problem according to this thread.
---
Nobody. Its an incentive for new characters. 
---
You could also do free transfers to the outnumbered faction and a gold bonus or free respecs if you prefer.
---
They would definitely like to believe that, but no, most alliance are absolute dog shit on this server.
---
Nostalgic?
---
I think they mean the smaller faction on a server?  I'm not sure why they think that the smaller faction "has to leave"...but i agree and I'm not crapping on their language use, just confused by it.
---
sorc dagger is a welfare epic. same people that roll on the epic MC 18 damage neck.
---
I agree with this.
---
There is no way to fix it without micromanaging it to the point people will quit for new reasons.
---
The amount of honor the 40 people inside an AV receive doesnt matter? You realize its those 40 versus thousands in a race to get the most honor right?
---
Does it give the same amount for Darkspear Trolls?
---
Yeah it's pretty silly
---
Anyone think blitz will do faction changes? I kinda assume they will and I'd love to try pally on horde side. 
---
My assumption is they're going to implement it for like 25 bucks so to play a pally on the pvp server you want it would be a 25 change faction on another server and 25 sever move.
---
I guess its more common than i thought :o
---
I guess we'll find out.  But they don't "have to leave".
---
Server and faction?
---
Teehee, please don't come to Sulfuras indeed! :P
---
Buuuuuuut, if you do..... 
---
I'm Onra, Leader of &lt;Norrath Classic&gt; on Sulfuras as well as being the organizer and creator of the Sulfuras Alliance Coalition.
---
I've put on community events such as: [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dmrkw2/server\_first\_sulfuras\_on\_sulfuras/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dmrkw2/server_first_sulfuras_on_sulfuras/)

If any Alliance guilds are transferring Contact Onra#5748 about the guild coalition, here is our mission statement: [https://i.imgur.com/V3VuQSB.png](https://i.imgur.com/V3VuQSB.png) We have over 20 raiding guilds participating.
---
In pve swords are a bit better.
---
Its a one time attunement cost, you dont pay that every time you zone in
---
Glad you could bake it, Arthas.
---
I mean it means female cow/elk/bear, etc. Bull is the male, sow is the female
---
Yes ofcourse. People will have to play more, and their brackets will get ruined since br 14,13 and 12 stop at a certain honor threshold to stop overfarming and fucking each other up
---
If you have both sets, you can tank dungeons and deal damage in raids
---
you have committed the classic blunder of having an opinion on reddit
---
W OMEGALUL W
---
Knowing the quests/route is huge. My friends constantly ask "where do I go next" and while I can tell them the zone, quest pathing makes a huge difference in efficiency... and knowing when to grind
---
Gold/bags is more of a QoL thing unless you're playing rogue/warrior, but even then the main thing you'll need is a good weapon
---
Took a look at your post history. You have made 3 posts recently asking which weapon is better. Don't you think you'd be better off learning the game so you can make these decisions for yourself? In each post, someone has responded with a link to the fight club discord and a dps spreadsheet you can use to figure it out. However, you continue to ignore that advice and instead rely on being spoonfed by whatever reddit user happens to respond. I am sure next time you get a possible weapon upgrade, you will just be back here again, blindly relying on reddit. 
---
I bet if I looked at your gear, I would find all sorts of issues because you have just been relying on being spoonfed what items to wear, rather than actually learning what stats you need and how to properly balance AP, crit and hit chance.
---
Paladins would not be able to faction change, same as Shamans for the Horde.
---
[deleted]
---
Back then when they brought in paid transfers during the Naxx patch?
---
Yeh, cos this is exactly the same as then!
---
May i introduce to you the double warlock buff combo. Water breathing + detect invis.
---
Oh my god I remember you! Gnome warrior
---
I still can't get into BRD after an hour long corpserun. I've been 54 for two fucking months now.
---
Just honor grind AV and install HonorSpy. 1-3weeks depending on how much you play
---
Boy when it came to a paid service, released "in the future" meant after like a week. They wasted no time to get the paid feature up and running.
---
That entire series is amazing. Please watch the Back Seat Gaming one. It’s so funny
---
So I just tried Bartender and maybe I was using it wrong, but as far as I could tell the different profiles only moved the location/style of my action bars. I'm looking for something that will allow my "1" key to use maul in one profile, and then I can load a different profile and have "1" be feral charge, for example.
---
Tac mastery is overcome through increased rage Gen from dw and/or rage pots. Save bloodrage for when you stance dance if you need to mocking blow immediately or something. Although you shouldn't really need to because you shouldn't lose threat nearly as often as full prot.
---
Sure I'll give you the 5% parry point. However most people that have gear past Mc gear are using an impale build and might only have a few points in parry.
---
Still think the benefits far outweigh the negatives. Believe me, I wish they didn't. Shield slam feels way more fun to me than dw fury prot, but it's just too good. My guild does sub 1 hr Mc clears and the dps autistically grab every raid buff possible, even playing a prot war for 5+ years pm private servers I'm not able to hold aggro without going dw fury Prot.
---
He actually wants to PvP and casually 5-man, as he said in literally the comment thread you’re responding to
---
Weekly reset?
---
I'm SM/Ruin since I'm still actively raiding with my guild. Now nearly 4k HP unbuffed since I just hit rank 8. I'm also engi and try to make use of nades when I can. That damn net though... probably net myself more times than it nets my opponent. I definitely agree, SL spec would probably make all of my problems go away.  I also feel like you probably need at least 300 SP for SL spec to probably be worthwhile (I'm at around 250 right now). 
---
The biggest problem with SM/Ruin is not being able to swap pets.  I usually favor VW since it's more of a one glove fits all type of thing whereas felhunter is more situational, specifically for casters. Getting jumped by a rogue or warrior with felhunter out is no bueno.
---
1v1 with undead warlocks is a major pain too since they have that fear advantage... but again, doesn't help if I already had VW out.
---
As a random passerby reading this, you're the one that looks like a little bitch, man.
---
Delete
---
It's more of the experience of leveling on the Alliance as opposed to just swinging a hammer
---
Just wait until BWL when we get to murder our guildies on Nef.
---
Hunters have a lot of things that give parry, pvp gear, passive talents, and active deterence. It's probably not above 50% but pretty close with the active.
---
They could just match some items or hand out lower ones if you want to switch, wouldn't be that hard to implement and it would be your own choice if you do switch.
---
Hey man check the the community resources link in sidebar, link to the mages discord in there has a channel for farming
---
And people will pay for it like junkies, no wonder why blizzard don't merge realms anymore.
---
Have you watched Barneybee on YouTube? He almost made me decide on rerolling to an RP server haha
---
Thank you!
---
More than likely your honor addon was not counting diminishing returns from repeated kills of the same player in a 24h period.
---
AV just gives too much fucking honor.
---
reeeeeeeeee
---
Lmao, horde is the only faction with big pvp guilds?
---
So, I came over to EF a week after it opened to escape queues. For a long while, it was fairly balanced. But because of that, when P2 hit, Alliance started coming over. Now it's not balanced. Alliance out number horde. Last we looked it's 57/43 A/H. While that's not completely bad, it's still fairly tilted, and given the choice of transfers or not transfers, both Horde and Alliance generally agree that people shouldn't transfer here.
---
Am alliance. We're a dad server. You'll have more fun on other servers.
---
there is no one with that much honor on my megaserver (horde)
---
"Fuck you we're gonna compete for this quest spawn!"
---
...
---
"Hey!! You stole my quest!!"
---
It's nice to see the kids still get into WoW
---
It gives 2.5 rep to other factions, I confirmed.
---
So it doesn't give as much to trolls, but it still gives. If you grind it for a week or so, you should be exalted with all horde factions.
---
People from my guild who played on pservers think it wont be a problem for our casual guild.
---
Meatball surgery. “Brother, you’re fucked but I’ll try to put you back together.”
---
Yes, Blizzard is responsible for ALL of this. Why? Because they were only interested in adding subscribers not providing a true classic experience. All they would have had to do was to make Classic a separate subscription and we wouldn't have to deal with the dickheads on retail. They are also responsible for creating super servers and not changing the spawn timers on resource nodes. 5x the player base but resource nodes are exactly the same.
---
Private servers had NONE of this bullshit.
---
Yeah I play as a horse there. Its fucking terrible (for me)
---
Should have said cute instead.
---
Oh wow. Didnt think of that
---
Warlocks also make a great choice, considering you don't have to buy a mount at 40 and also make perfect gold farmers in DM/Mara.  Plus leveling is easy: if you can fear it, you can kill it.
---
Traitor!
---
Whats TuF?
---
Impale build is shit. Anyone using that is just bad and outdated. Ever since we knew about crit suppression months ago impale build is dead. 5 crit in cruelty and 5 parry is way better than the impale build. 
---
And yes, if you actually have DPS that go hard, you need fury prot. But most of the people currently playing fury prot don't actually need it to hold threat. 
---
My point was criticizing the idea that you lose "nothing' by respeccing fury prot. Because 90% of tanks should be deep prot right now.
---
Was done three hours early last week. It was done five hours early this week.
---
As someone whose only day off is Tuesdays, this is totally fine.
---
No need to go to Feralas, when you can go to Hinterlands (the High elf lodge has a lake).
---
&gt; But retail faction imbalance is just as bad or worse.
---
It's a different sort of faction imbalance. In terms of numbers of players, it's not an issue. 
---
In terms of the competitive playerbase aka raiding and pvping and what not, yeah it's horde-dominated. 
---
Retail has sharding and cross-server gameplay which solves the *actual* game-ending issues for players, not having anyone to play with. 
---
In classic, there's your server and that's it.
---
"Just change servers" shouldn't be the solution. 
---
Let me ask you this: What is the negative result of a balanced server? What are the negative results of positive incentives? 
---
&gt;Let the 90:10s exist
---
But why though? 90:10s seem like a negative for everyone. No PvP for the 90 faction, very few friends for the 10 faction. If you offered incentives juicy enough to start balancing the server when it was 55:45, you wouldn't end up in the 90:10 area and you wouldn't have the negative experiences.
---
Yes bring me more prot warriors. Easy pickings for a rogue
---
Fall damage is % based on total health. Buff increases their overall health total but doesn't heal them, so technically they're at a lower % of health after. Oops you'll no longer survive at 1% health. 😂
---
Could you link to that item/quest please? Never heard of it unless I'm missing something.
---
I accidentally sold mirahs, can't get it back. What's best? I have brutality and dal rends set.
---
&gt; The shaman planned to use them, they were an upgrade, he just wasn't at the necessarily level. I agree that they were better for your mage compared to the shaman, especially since the Omnicast Boots are BiS for mages. But to deny him a chance at the boots when he does plan to use them seems incredibly greedy.
---
Yikes buddy. This is how I know you will never get it.
---
And yes, if you are only needing on things you need this wouldn't even be a post. But you yourself said you need on any spec gear. That is not NEED, that is GREED.
---
Thank you all for the help/suggestions
---
Theyre open now, as of today. Looks like you can transfer now!
---
Being forced to use a rage pot or bloodrage instead of stoneshield or mighty rage at more optimal time is a crutch. There will still be times you want to intercept AND mocking blow. There will still be times you want to use a different stance and don't have access to a rage pot or blood rage.
---
Half the server is doing fine
---
I moved to pagle and it's been great so far - lots of friendly folks, guilds, and even our own no-life lv22 horde rogue twink named Escortfailed who spends 24\7 camping moonbrook just to Hank the defias traitor all day.
---
&gt; 不會讀中文🤷‍♂️
---
250 sp is pretty shit for pve gear. And you do way more dps with mind flay tank 1, and fulfill your true purpose of maintaining shadow weaving.
---
Yeah I mostly do all these posts cause I have nothing to do my first two hours at work and I wanna hear people out. And it’s mostly just weapons. Also sorry I used to play a Druid where weapons are just stat sticks. 
---
Also my gear is pretty solid. Got like 3/4 of the way through my pre raid bis. 
---
Could use a lil more hit and a whole bunch more crit
---
I mean depends right? Normal realms are probably a lot harder to have people agree to bracket stacking. Faerlina has issues with it, whereas Herod (at least ally side) doesn't as much.
---
I've been waiting for this! My stupid ass made my main on a west coast server before it was clear which servers were which, Does anyone know how to find out which servers are more populated( more then the game just saying low medium and high) I don't want to have to switch realms again. lol
---
Which means what.
---
Sorry but 90% of those assholes are from retail. They are unhappy with retail so they come here to shit in our wheaties.
---
Sounds like Mograine-EU. Aaand probably bunch of other realms.
---
Anyone else not seeing the WoW shop on the character screen?
---
Just backing you up here that the way you are describing it is also the way it works on my server. I also play druid and got my healing gear by tanking, but it was always with healers that were ok with me rolling on those pieces which was checked before we started the dungeon.
---
Atiesh is about 2 to 1.
---
parse != performance
---
he appears to be on MT heals, and quick skim of logs reveals MT death on magmadar. I would rather have 10 green parses then be responsible for my MT losing world buffs 20% into the run.
---
MT healing a DW fury tank is naturally going to parse higher, but here the choice of fury tank is unnecessary (raid dps doesn't justify it) and is actually harming your raid.
---
This is a lot of effort to pretend you're retarded... I really hope you're pretending
---
So funny. People were begging for this not long ago. Now they are bitching because it happened. Time to leave this sub. Insufferable.
---
There’s a staff off the water elemental boss in Gnomeregan that grants underwater breathing if you hold it:

---
I mean if someones dropping that money to rank I think thats fine. Its not like it takes any skill to get r14, you just need to no life it. If someone wants R14 that much I say its fine.
---
LOOKS LIKE IT WORKED MUTHAFUCKAS!
---
IMO after testing I think axe of the deep woods is better. The more damage has made it so much easier for me to keep agro. So you wrongly assumed I didn’t do any testing and took peoples word as fact. You have assumed so many things. Like I don’t even know hit chance? You are just saying these things to make yourself feel better. I’ve heard hit chance is about 8 percent, and closer to 5 percent if you have 5 extra weapon skill. With dual wield I believe this is just so you don’t miss special attack’s with your main hand but you can still miss auto attacks.
---
"We miss Classic WoW because community!" also "We don't want you here in our community!" /r/gatekeeping
---
Yes I did that during the free transfers. Worked no issue
---
It's also worth mentioning that there are people who want 13 for the purple set, and for whatever reason don't think 14 is worth the investment.  I'm not trying to judge the accuracy of this claim, but for example, we have a mage who claims they will be stopping at 13 because the Nefarion staff is good enough.  Another example might be a warrior with BRE, who just doesn't feel the weapon is enough of an improvement to continue.  Kind of sucks for my class, shaman, though because we don't see anything like that healing mace for a very long time.  Even the sp damage dagger would be better in a healing set than anything we'd see from raid in a long time.
---
That's what happens when you both go for the blonde!
---
I usually just say "All need on the hat if you want."
---
This alerts everyone I'll be needing, and let's them know to need or pass respectively.
---
Same with bags and so on.
---
I didn't play in classic, so I don't share those mindless sentiments. modern players are more competitive than back then. If you cant compete, get out. easy as that
---
How does this work for dps, like rogues? Cuz i have PVE and PVP gear for the same spec. Is that fine?
---
&gt;They do it to grief.
---
LOL 
---
And ya that AV battleground sure is some real pvp
---
Canon boss in strat live and the emperor in BRD I know drop it as well
---
Well according to the facts that flurry axe is better for tanking. I don’t think it’s better cause I lose agro easier. 
---
Just because one list says something is better. Don’t take everything for fact moron
---
Sounds a lot like an activision cash register XD
---
Assuming decent gear and skilled player, can Fury/Prot pump respectable DPS while not tanking in raids?
---
Stop being such a tryhard.
---
No we don't want any refugees. I like my server the way it is. I'm slighty outnumbered which leaves the "I'm not locked in here with you. No, you're locked in here with me" situations that are too much fun.
---
Horde will pick off slow mounts from getting to galv in the first place. That's why you tell them to go far right around snowfall graveyard so they survive instead of getting blocked off from galv and drek.
---
actually a lot of pugs exist, not sure how a pug means you're "carrying" the person who organized the pug anymore than any other person in the pug.
---
Also, there are a surplus of people who want to tank raids compared to the available slots.
---
So wrong on both counts there wp
---
You're still shouting. Dude you have anger issues. Nobody has yelled at you. At all. You came in here swinging then cried the victim when popular opinion didn't fall on your side.
---
You need help.
---
Yeah 5 minutes you think he died 9 times in 5 minutes?
---
When setting out to do something people definitely do research. We are referring to how when given a token for something - most people’s reaction is to turn it in. 
---
Sure when your goal is to do rep then yeah people do a little research or ask around like in guild or friends. That’s not what’s being discussed
---
Similar thing happened, kinda, to me. I was 57ish mage trying to finish aoe to 60(was before phase 2 lol) at hearthglenn, there was a fellow alliance already 60 farming for gold/runecloth? Real dick. I was fine with sharing spawns, he was not. When I rounded some up, he would pull elites I and other groups into my blizzard and fuck my rotation up, killing me several times. Well two can play that game. As he was mounted rounding up mobs, I would tag them then run. I gave up on lvling for that time and just fucked his pulls for hours (I added him, he was there all day for days) at one point we just sat there staring at the mobs for about an hour and a half cuz we would just ruin each others pulls. It ended when I watched him get ganked by a horde group, which I honestly could have helped and both of us would won the fight. I /lol spammed at him as he was getting murdered. I got got as well but I didn't care. I wanted him to see I could help, but preferred us both dead than him alive. He whispered me called me a piece of shit and insta blocked me. 
---
Fuck him. He started it.
---
No it's a joke mocking wu maos.
---
yes, that's why I made the comment.
---
How is it completely wrong when what I said is the same thing just not as detailed. Lol
---
Very easy even as arcane/raid.  Have herbing to make the most out of it.
---
Odd choice of music boomer
---
Blacktooth Grin :)
---
I believe it’s called “Dawns Gambit”
---
Wish this was a bit more common info. I would love more tank variety being accepted.
---
Tribe has a published list of useful WeakAuras for classic, and one of them is an AV Timer. 
---
You can find the list here: https://pastebin.com/WUDCfg1A
---
AV timer is the second from the top. In case you haven't used a weakaura, you'll need to download the weakauras mod, and then import this aura.
---
You can see what they look like if you skip around through [this video of Tribe using them](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/520403742)
---
Wait wait wait. I attempt to engage your silly mindset and \*IM\* the one who's a tryhard?
---
no wonder this community is toxic, it eats itself alive
---
No taser can harm me MORTAL!!
---
Faerlina has had open transfers out to decently popped 50/50 faction balance servers since the game released.
---
Anyone who wanted out had plenty of opportunity to do it for free. Highly doubt we'll see anyone leave.
---
Asmon is a special case because he really wants to play on a PvE server, so he actually might leave but I honestly doubt he will, and also Olympus is now just one normal sized guild and I doubt even many of Olympus would follow him to a PvE server.
---
Even if all Olympus left it would have an extremely minimal impact on the server at this point
---
The only way Faerlina would get fucked by this is by allowing people to come in to the highest pop server that also has pretty fking decent faction balance. (Absolutely guarantee you people would flood in if they were allowed. There's a reason they aren't letting people lol)
---
Oh snap. I've avoided weak auras my entire time until now for no reason, but when I get home from work i am going to look this up. Thanks a bunch!
---
Wooo can move my high lvls off the pvp server. Wasnt confident in that choice and really wanted RP. Worth the 100 bucks  for me
---
Lol okay. If you're in a guild that prot works to hold threat then good for you I guess.
---
It's an open world game.  That's the very definition of creating your own fun...
---
I play on Bigglesworth but rarely see any discussion about it. Is it a good server? I don't play enough to know myself.
---
where did i say it was not bis? 
---
i'm talking about this from a pure time/effort to reward stand point 
---
i genuinely hope all the other warriors in my guild go for rank 10, free stuff for me
---
Honor gets reset when you transfer it says
---
  Nah I mean what is the prob with strong arming you there? He just wants to contest a spot.
---
     This dosent have to become some personal war, or something where we talk about how the community has changed. I think this concept is a bit foreign to WoW players but in other mmos, maybe typically eastern ones you can flag and kill people grinding in your spot and thats essentially all that really happened there.
---
This isnt out of the ordinary, and it isnt a bad or good thing.
---
That's right! Pagle sucks! Worst players, trash economy, even Darnassus smells bad. Stay away!
---
Wrong. It is not 8 percent. It is 9 percent. 6 percent with 5 extra weapon skill.
---
The dual wield penatly is 19% for a total of 28% miss without weapon skill. This only applies to white swings, not yellow/special attacks.
---
However, currently while heroic strike is queued, your offhand white swings lose the dual wield penalty as well. So you will not miss with only 9% hit while heroic strike is queued. This essentially means that 1% hit past 9% is worth like nearly nothing (6 AP ish). This means that we should only ever gear for hit cap and nothing more. So a prebis list with 3% over hit cap is wasting tons of potential crit/AP by taking that hit instead. In the orc list, you should have eye of rend instead of mask of the unforgiven and riphook instead of satyr's bow. Once you get lionheart, you cut more hit (vambraces of the sadist instead of battleborn and a better ring over blackstone). 
---
But yea, you don't know any of that, and neither does the rest of reddit. So asking questions here is just pointless.
---
60 Priest with pretty good gear, epic mount, etc. is stuck in raidlog land at the moment.
---
35 Rogue, kinda meh.  
---
34 Warlock, kinda meh.   
---
I'm sure if I put more time into those two toons, I'd have a lot of fun, but... My 29 warrior. I'm having a freaking blast with warrior.
---
I haven't personally ran into any of the "warrior is awful leveling," that everyone seems to talk about. Sure, the leveling slowed down at level 25 or so, but I made it to (almost) 30 faster on my warrior than any of my others (1d8h~), and that's with crafting, skinning, and mining.
---
So yeah, maybe. I seem to be cursed and not be able to get over the level 30 bump.
---
So now we will see a bunch of alliance heavy realms and a bunch of horde only realms?
---
my point was that this is not "quite a lot less". you made it sound like it would be a significant difference. less than 3 dollars is not a significant difference.
---
To be fair Alliance on Stalagg were leaving to get away from Grizzly as much as the Horde
---
i actually get a LOT of level 1 spy accounts whispering me asking what the honor is like, i think Flamelash is actually very ideal for the people wanting to get to rank 10+ on easy mode. 
---
also our guild organized our first MC run with the remnants of people that either stayed behind or find out later that their guilds left without them, [fear the rare Alliance train.](https://i.imgur.com/OZyZARd.jpg)
---
13k av rep to go, 15m queues, brain is mush, woop woop
---
If youre there as a tank you shouldnt be rolling on a rogues BiS item its just etiquette. If youre there as a cat then you have just as much right to it as him
---
GW1... 13 year old me bought so much gold in that game.. 55 monking and learning the word "doppelganger"

For warrior tanks:
---
Does sunder generate the same about of threat when applied at 5 stacks and when applied at 0 stacks?
---
No problem! Weakauras are amazing, you can display pretty much anything you want on the screen with them! 
---
They can be a little bit complex to make yourself for the first time, but there's tons of great ones out there that are easy to import
---
I posted this in another thread but thought you might find it interesting: 
---
"If anyone is curious: it took me roughly 20hrs to reach exalted in AV as an alliance playing on US servers solo queuing. I had 72 wins, 25 losses for a total of 1187hk and 203895 honor. One match took 90 minutes where we summoned Ivus but still lost where I got 359hk. Other than that most matches were between 12-35min."
---
This was all within the first 3-4 days of BGs being released.
---
you just boosted the quality meter for this sub by 1000%

Really nice editing and I’m in for more!

[Use blizzards item recovery](https://us.battle.net/support/en/restoration)
---
Same level as me, attacking while I was low health fighting mobs. Does it really matter? Problem is there's \~5x more people in the world who might want to attack me out of the blue.
---
Yup, they've fucked up beyond repair as of now. Faction queues, with free faction transfers is the only possible answer, but that brings a whole other score of problems.
---
The point is just that Blizzard are responsible, and could have accounted for this problem, earlier.
---
It sure does!
---
People always bitch and complain. You will only really know these answers once you experience it for yourself.
---
From my perspective, im having a lot of fun ranking, and so are all my guildmates, and various friends ive made. So its not all doom and gloom for everyone.
---
Lol you know what I mean. The simulation made the list.
---
I find it funny you’re under the impression that min/maxing matters at all and that anyone trying for R14 isn’t a masochist. 
---
The DPS warrior that has his shoulders and legs won’t do that much more DPS than 1 rocking Flameguard and Eldritch. Not at all. It’s an insane waste of time for minuscule upgrades that is only completed by masochists. 
---
I’m guessing you understand how hard it is to actually get to R11 but you talk about it like all min/maxers will get R11-13 and they definitely will not considering only about 150 ppl per server and faction will even be those ranks any given week and those people aren’t just going to quit and let mid Ranks take their spot. Not to mention if you’re not R10 at the time of this writing then you actually don’t have a chance for months to get there. 
---
Wish folks like you would stop talking about these ranks as if they’re just easily obtainable and if you want to min/max then you have to get them. Don’t put that kinda thought into other gamers heads as if they don’t play enough already.
---
The engineering trinket solves that issue. Sadly it’s on a 4 hour cooldown. If you can get to WS, then Felwood and Ashzara are a short flight away. I’m also a warlock that does jump runs and princess, so my hearth is in Gadgetzan or  Ratchet since I’m mailing all my auction items to my bank alt and only need to access my bank. I kind of wish I was a mage with engineering.
---
Oh, hai! How much rank did you gain this week? I hope the reality of this honor system rewarding bots, account sharers and the unemployed isn't crashing down too hard on you.
---
Sounds fun, hows the survivability?
---
&gt;I mean enjoy being blacklisted by half the people you run with at endgame
---
Is this some sort of knee-jerk reaction to someone rolling on an item you want?
---
I've literally never known anyone blacklist me or anything of the sort for rolling OS despite all these reddit claims, in general most of my runs finish with a good vibe and with someone being added to my friend list. 
---
A good attitude, friendly demeanor and willingness to help is generally a better way to attract people than whether they roll on loot or not. If you are basing friends/blacklists based purely off loot... I'm sorry but you are probably a cancerous player and I wouldn't want to group with you. I'd much rather have a decent run with people that are nice where I don't get loot, than a run full of people with that sort of attitude and the item actually dropping. No amount of loot is worth being grouped with people like that. 
---
As for the endgame content... I've got a core raid spot for my druid for BWL when it comes out, so I'm not too worried. As for being blacklisted from level 60 instances... If this happened I honestly wouldn't be aware of it considering the amount of PM's I'll get a day asking me to tank dungeons. 
---
&gt;I would never run with a Druid that did this without discussing it first.
---
And you don't have to. But if you don't discuss it, don't be surprised when it happens.
---
spoken like a true fucking dumbass.....the former guild of blood legion was and is still on illidan to this day,a PVP SERVER.......you know how many people had to transfer over to illidan to even trial for them,far too many to count...but yeah go ahead u fucking dumbass go back in time 5-6 years and tell them to transfer off of illidan because u dont want raiders on your server and tell me what their response is.
---
its people like you who dont understand and never will,thats why retail has warmode,because of people like you. and thats why your classic server is about to be topsy tervey,and i cannot wait to see people like you bitch when your server dies.,
---
Update worked for me but otherwise can't login to Battlenet or the game
---
I know, how dare they not be perfect and 100% infallible.
---
I've never ever seen an MMO that doesnt have regular downtime and updates. In fact almost every single video game I have that's not 5 years old still gets updates. The fucking nerve right?
---
I mean seriously are you fucking stupid? You must have no fucking clue how coding works otherwise youd never say ignorant shit about every working 100% the first time.
---
Go over to any programming subreddit and ask how feasible it is to code for an MMO and put out 100% flawless bugless updates that dont require further updates to fix.
---
They will laugh at your dumbass till they are blue in the face.

You never noticed other people talking to eachother or posting about forming a group? No one ever whispered to you or invited you?
---
The wow classic community is killing itself and blaming Blizzard. Fssss.
---
That's why I decided to go for rank 8.  My class gets a good set bonus, not worth trying to hit 2 higher tanks for 2 pieces of blue gear. 
---
I barely missed my R8 this week which really sucks but at least I just need to get barely into bracket 8 for next week.  This is honestly the least fun I've ever had grinding in WoW and can't wait for it to be over.

Honestly when I was a kid in vanilla I did this, just not cross faction. I caused a lot of people to turn on eachother. I considered trolling an art
---
What’s a good leveling build? I just hit 30 and want to feel strong.
---
I didn't see him waiting around. I think he was in the area and just happen to come back to check on me.
---
I know in Vanilla anything after 2am server counted as the next day.  It would also not show on the tab until the next day's calculations happen.  Perhaps that's what's goin on?
---
I have strong sense that some WoW players have caveman as parent.
---
Holy shit you are dumb. Being off by 1 hit when you only need 6 is huge. If you remember one number, it should be your hit cap.
---
Just because you are missing some attacks doesn't mean that it is optimal to add more hit. 
---
You should be queueing heroic strike as much as possible and cancelling it if you don't have enough rage. 
---
However, when fully raid buffed, you don't even have to cancel heroic as you will have tons of rage to spam it anyways. 
---
Even if you never queue/cancel heroic strike, hit past cap isn't worth it to make your auto attacks hit a bit more. Consider that 1% crit affects both your yellow swings and your whites, where as 1% hit past cap only affects your whites. 
---
I'm not going to sit here arguing with a moron about facts. You want to continue to be ignorant and feelcraft your way through the game, fine. But you are also relying on the worst resources available (wowclassicbis and reddit) while feelcrafting. Your gearing is incorrect. Your play is incorrect. Your knowledge is incorrect. Your approach to acquiring knowledge is incorrect. 
---
Crowd sourcing weapon choices off of reddit LOL. What a joke.
---
I guess my basic understanding had been mages are the best gold farmers, but have locks and hunters surpassed them at this point in classic?

They're BoE. You can tip a crafter, provide mats and call it a day
---
I did the same thing with my warlock! Just didn’t get them as far as you. I got a UD lock to about 20, but starting feeling like I wanted to try an Orc since none of my toons were Orc. Got him up to about 17 or so, then rolled to another class.
---
Lmao maybe you’re right. In that case, I feel pretty lucky
---
It does, but the others are just spillover, meaning they increase by 25% of whatever the main one is increasing at.
---
What’s ur opinion on Star of Mystria VS dark pendant neck. I switch around with them not 100% sure what i like the most.
---
A guildie got banned from "trolling AV" so they definitely do have support staff for Classic.

---
That’s a huge part of Classic for me that I love. 
---
In my experience, the two different factions feel like ENTIRELY different games.
---
It’s a time sink game where you compete against others but it’s purely about who has more time and nth else
---
We are from Hungary, my gf even speaks Finnish, he was studiing the Finnugric languages, thats how we met Finnish students.
---
I only know words though ;(
---
This guys call to arms was pretty cringe, but he won me over with the way he took it.
---
I'm in a guild with two raid teams. I lead the second raid team.
---
One team is tuesday. One team is thursday. Occasionally people swap between raids based on scheduling changes.
---
Both teams clear MC and Onyxia in the same night in less than 2 hours every week.
---
On the second team weve been clearing MC and Ony without fail for two months straight. In fact weve cleared MC faster than the original first raid team.
---
Raid team one has gotten a binding and our second team got Sulf Hammer.
---
Another guild on my server has four full raid teams. Three of them clear MC and Ony in under 2 hours, the fourth clears MC and Ony in less than 3 hours.
---
What about once you cap the main capital rep?
---
BWL out on 01.01.2020 it is.
---
This. We get youre a hybrid and have multiple gear sets. Try to sympathise that dps only have ‘one’ spec so you rolling off against them looks and is greedy.
---
Can't get Ranks as high as 13 or 14 if you have a job and a life honestly.  Most people that get those either don't have a job or do some sort of account sharing.
---
I am sure there are a very small number of outliers that manage to work 8 hours a day, no life 12 hours a day in game and get 4 hours of a sleep a night that could do it but that's not healthy nor sustainable for any period of time.
---
Wow this is an amazing post, I’m a mage so now I know what the hell is going on in a good Warriours head. Didn’t realize charge had to be (out of combat) . What are ornate mithril boots and the belt you were talking about?
---
Couple of things: 
---
1.Where would this data be available to you? 
---
2.Im coming from Blaumeux (26 Rogue) and Arcanite Reaper (28 Priest). Is the population active enough for me to not have any issues finding dungeons or groups? Arcanite Reaper feels like a dead realm (but is listed at Medium) while Blaumeux feels like it’s not really that densely packed for a server that’s supposedly “high population”.
---
Why would it take 30 minutes?, we do double raid groups we wiped horde every time we went to raid.
---
Well the trend exists bc the customers love it and demand it
---
Elemental Fire is farmable inside dungeons as well, so not possible anyway
---
Nice try buddy, we heard all the info over on Horde side, you can't change our minds now!
---
I settled for a warlock. But then battlegrounds came out and I love healing in BGs.. aaaaaand now I am undecided again, my 53 Priest is getting lots of playtime and might be the new main soon. I have lots of other alts, but these two are the main contenders. My warlock is already raiding though and I've put so many hours into it. Decisions, decisions...
---
I'm at 190 runs and still going =/ still hopeful(ish)
---
15 minutes doesn’t sound that bad of a queue when people in this sub where predicting over 30 minute queues. But when you put it that way, having a queue last longer than a match sounds awful.
---
Do you have different talent specs between your priests? One of my higher level toons is a 53 UD priest. I basically leveled dungeons exclusively by healing spellcleave groups from 28+ but was shadow spec from level 40.
---
I will probably get him to 60 at some point but healing get old fast and the shadow dps rotation isn’t too much fun. PvP is a whole different story though.
---
You got called out scrub.
---
No wonder you end up on the B team in every guild.
---
You won't see it but it gives it.
---
Thats what she said.
---
My sides when none of my friends believed me at launch. And wasted hours of their lives waiting in queues. I tried to tell them.... they just wouldn't listen.
---
I don't have a list of your current gear because you are avoiding providing it. 
---
I responded based on the assumption you have the pieces on wowclassicbis, the one piece of information you provided.  But it was worded in a specific way, talking about the value of hit past cap. Because it was so clear, you could take that information and do something valuable with it, regardless of whether my assumption was 100% correct.
---
So it sounds like my post had plenty of value. 
---
Now, move along little orc. You know the hit cap, you know your gear list is scuffed, hopefully you can be a better player in the future. But you will probably keep relying on the internet to spoon feed you because you're an idiot.
---
pretty sure it covers both, IDK tho, because I'm NA.
---
their only requirement is that you have an epic mount.
---
message serade#7594 on discord for inv
---
it’s to discourage just anyone transferring, they don’t want people switching around like it’s nothing.
---
because if you blind them after opener they can't do anything.
---
I fckin hate AoE farmers. It's nice seeing that they kill and distrupt eachother.
---
Druid here. Main spec bear. I reccomend you do as well.
---
When you're the tank it's usually easy to gear. My cat spec is 2/3 my healer is 3/4 my bear is almost full pre bis and my moonkins is lacking 1/4 of the way.
---
But I just tank and I roll need if nobody needs it. Though I ALWAYS ask first. Never once had an issue.
---
Though I've also passed on gear I could've used and noone would have been mad at me rolling (LFG roll if you'll use. Not MS&gt;os) I still passed the hit necklace to the warlock. Felt really scummy tbh.
---
I mean we were all in SM for 15 levels anyway I don't really see the issue.
---
I really thought about it. But i didn't because i like to run minimal addons. Every one i use is essential for my purposes. 
---
I just watched streams during queues. Every hour I'd hearth to Kargath, after queueing, and pickpocket BRD until the queue pops. Make a bit of gold, you know.
---
Was between my druid, shaman, and hunter for a while. 57 on druid atm and pushing for end game but I'm starting to get the itch for an alt. rip
---
That does not answer my first question, which would be yes in terms of real life
---
OP dropping wisdom from "The Way of Kings" on us.
---
&gt;Many are considering quitting because 15 dollars a month to the budget just isn't worth restricted game time.
---
Good, tired of all you fucking whiners.
---
I get off between 4-5PM like a huge majority of people and never ever see servers down for maintenance.
---
Either unsub or get a better work schedule.
---
from herod, looks like the lag js isolated to just kalimdor for the time being here.
---
hopefully this doesn't fuck our raid.
---
How do premades work for AV? Just count down and queue at the same time, and only join the same game # ?
---
Do not go gentle into that good night, you beautiful bastards.
---
Asmongold watched a video about a guy on stream last tuesday (while waiting for the update to finish) who had made a few thousand gold doing death rolls. Ever since then everybody has been trying to do it.
---
This thread makes clear that you're in the minority. 
---
I'm glad it's working for you. 
---
It would piss people off on most servers.
---
Viper sting to make the little dick life tap for mana then aimed shot the little prick
---
and then you cant reset because there is a pet on you... Either way youre using vanish, why not stop the pet damage, and maybe get a stealth off instead
---
Yeah you could get rank 10 pretty easy, its just gonna be WAY more hard right now.
---
Yeah as a fellow druid of the Horde I do not condone what this dude is preaching. When I'm tanking, I roll on tank leather. When I'm healing I roll on healing leather. Everyone else should be like this, or clearly state what type of loot you are going for before you start the instance so they other people in your group can leave before they waste their time.
---
I honestly don't care, in the end the gear difference between pvp and pve people would not be that massive
---
The only issue I see are massive pve guilds that did all content transferring to pvp just to ruin things
---
It would do a little more damage but you'd also lose more damage from the time your raid had less shadow weaving bonus.. as spriest u just gotta realize you're not there to be top 5 casters dps so just put raid first
---
You kidding, being an adult with disposable income and no kids is awesome. Given how many people quit after hitting R14 it's that grind that sucks.
---
Not to mention they already compete with up to 3 or 4 of the 5 members depending on group composition
---
Rose tinted eh. Not a single example.
---
Well, one of the reasons I'm doing it is for the cheaper epic mount.
---
Guess I'll just power through it. Only about 3.5k to go.
---
When people have nothing in common with their neighbors, they lose any incentive to care about them
---
Losing half a rank when you're up there is fucking insane. That can easily be a 40-50 HOUR setback. 
---
To compare, if you have a way to grind 30 gold per hour, 50 hours is 1500g, gone.
---
So it took you around 100 matches to get to exalted.
---
I would wager it took me around 70, since revered to exalted is the halfway and that took me 34 games.
---
Your games were significantly shorter than mine, and you likely didn't have much of a queue time. 
---
Interesting.
---
Do.. um. people have jobs or nah?
---
3-4 hardcore ranker that transfer to your lowpop realm can fuck up the whole pool
---
Every time I've been in that situation I PM'd the farmer with what my quest needs are. They all invited me for 1 or 2 pulls so I finished my quest and I yeet out of there with a thank you. Good experiences for me so far.
---
Just had a match where a few of us stalled allies out in that one GY near their big bunker, rest of the group pushed north and won eventually, was some of the most fun i've had in that cursed BG
---
I agree with that. But then it isn't "loot rules", it's just common sense.
---
Exactly! In my personal experience so many druid players do this. You either tank heal or dps and get items accordingly. Its idyllic to think in such a loot based game that you could consume 2 or even 3specs of loot until its literally at disenchant level.
---
if you don't blind the hunter after opener he can sit on flare and eat or scatter trap you and wait out pet blind. if you blind hunter after opener, you can vanish the pet and reopen hunter. I don't see a situation where blinding pet is good because it guarantees you're getting trapped which means blind isn't doing anything for you.
---
Interesting stuff. Thanks for sharing.
---
I am in the same boat, my guilds discord raid chat is more serious than a court of law its a bloody rp server for gods sake.
---
Thanks mate. Glad you’re good at wow and I can take your advice, and happy that you’re terrible at arguing so I could keep trolling you all day. You saved me from 3 hours of watching terrible Christmas Shows on Netflix with my family.
---
It means you do different things depending on what the fight (or even the situation) calls for.
---
Well, you're right, some multiboxers just can't take a joke and struggle with social interaction. They're a one-man "Party of Five"
---
i have the same problem and want to solve this,dont know if it was addon or not but i refreshed everything and its still not there.
---
The build matters much less than your weapon. If possible, get whirlwind axe. Otherwise, RFC, SM arm, and Ulda have good weapons.
---
Honestly though, leveling didn't really start to feel good until I was almost 40.
---
&gt;This thread makes clear that you're in the minority. 
---
I agree that this reddit thread shows that. It's a good thing the game isn't a representation of this thread though. 
---
&gt;I'm glad it's working for you. 
---
Me too!
---
&gt;It would piss people off on most servers.
---
That really is unfortunate, but I'd hope they understand that rolling for loot you need and plan to use isn't some sort of personal attack.
---
He is completely right. If all horde rush and all horde get 5k honor every 10m, then it's irrelevant because the competition is between horde.
---
Now that ALL horde get 20-30m matches, we also all get about the same honor/hour so it remains irrelevant.
---
This is a grind, not a competition or a sprint.
---
You only need 200 dps a person to do it without adds, I'd be concerned about any group that can't hit that.
---
Hopefully it stays dead so I can enjoy the salt of the horde not being able to do AQ. Man, I hope it happens.
---
This week is the hardest week to rank up. Because of all the PvE guys. If you wait for next week and get every week into bracket 12-14 it will take 5-6 weeks.
---
Yeah. I think that's partially why the meta shifted for Horde so dramatically after like the first or second day. At first it was "let the Alliance win in 6 minutes, it's more honor/hour for us." Now it's "play D, stall the Alliance zerg, try to win."
---
Horde now try to maximize every game because of the queues.
---
Fuck it, damn Blizzard, that was my present for Magic Kings on January the 5th...
---
Do you know how big of an impact not speccing into the Arms tree makes?   
---
I know not having Anger Management is more a QoL issue, but how much does missing out on talents like Impale influence DPS?
---
Do turn ins for free massive rep gain with your main faction.
---
Also it sometimes helps the match or whatever.
---
You deserved it. You went from fair equal level pvp to ganking.
---
Oh okay I'll have to look at my rep on the tab during turn ins then. Thanks for the heads up, I haven't been too concerned with turn ins because they give such shitty AV rep and that's all I'm there for.
---
I've made sure my addons are up to date with the Twitch desktop app, but when I go in game it still says almost all of my addons are out of date. Occasionally I'll get a Bagnon error message where I can't see all of my bags and I'll have to reload the UI.
---
How do you guys level so many alts? I hate being a weak low level so much whenever i try to level my warrior alt i kill like 3 or 4 mobs before saying fuck this and going back to my 60 warlock lol
---
Calling people pussies and playing on pve server.
---
300K honor and not even one rank, thats sickening lol
---
Yea its just a time sink.  Much better time playing the game/learning your class than zerg farming honor.  
---
That way, when you do end up with those R14 players, you end up using skill (and some catch up pve gear/blues) to hold your ground.  You might even smack them around leading to some quality meme posts.
---
Eve is more macchiavellian then?
---
Easily the funniest video I've seen all day.
---
Yeah I suck at the game because I don't read a fucking BiS list and do everything via guides because I'm incapable of thinking for myself. That makes a load of sense.
---
Would you like to play a game?
---
You are complaining that nobody on a PVE server wants to seriously PVP?
---
You probably should have chosen a PVP server then.
---
PVE servers are for casuals who dont want to be bothered in the open world while they pick flowers. You rolled on a casual PVP server, so you get casual players.
---
Paid transfers are available if you want to leave scrub land.
---
Completely justified bitching, brother warrior. Completely justified. Those who haven’t leveled a warrior will never know.
---
Check https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/warrior-leveling-classic-wow
---
But really keeping a good 2 hander feels really important from my experience. An old weapon with lower damage can cripple you.

Never played retail, can you guys suggest a class for me to play? I've tried Rogue and thought I would like it, but didn't really (got to around lvl 25), and Priest has been okay but something seems missing (also around lvl 25)
---
If I give my favorite League of Legends role and characters perhaps this will give you something to work with in a suggestion?
---
I'm a Jungler 98% of the time, the other 2% is when I'm forced to autofill.
---
Darius (good gap closer, has INSANE combo), Volibear (ability to ambush people with his GOTTAGOFAST abilities), Zac (amazing ambush gap closer), Nocturne (assassins are fun but he's a little too glass cannon for my taste), Diana (same as Nocturne but this was when she was still considered an assassin a few years back), Shyvana (again, great gap closer, can ambush people with it, but I dislike her lack of CC)
---
Basically I like the ambush tanky-ish characters with great gap-closers. DPS doesn't matter as much to me but I like to do some. I like having CC and many different ways to use it to help my team with good timing. And being a Jungle main I like the ambush part.
---
2.5k honor per hour... that’s why only 4 stayed till the end.
---
Yeah you’re right. It was cross realm BGs that came out after Naxx. Either way my point still stands. We had over two years of vanilla and I don’t think Blizzard should have given us the features that came at very last patch. It would be like having Naxx in classic right now. Seriously it’s them picking and choosing what 1.12 features we get. I stayed quiet on things like the talent system despite it making all PVE significantly easier but cross realm BGs AND transfers coming in a 7 day period when BWL isn’t even out yet? That’s a bit much for me to swallow. 
---
Also I’m told they don’t even have the six month cool down on transfers like they originally did. It’s dumb.
---
THIS. OP is an idiot or trolling
---
Bland, sci-fi looking font imo.
---
if you mean the chain lightning skill thats 1.5k dmg per target on crit with buffs and consumables from what ive seen but if you can send me a vid or something to some me otherwise and that's still 3 secs you have a chance to use consumables, engineering or have a team mate help you while rekoning bomb uses a bug that was unintentional to kill someone instantly not over a few secs but instantly buy hitting 5 autos + hoj procs + marco glitch bonus swings
---
Classic was/ is
---
 ruined by cheaters ...what a shame
---
&gt;horse
---
Yeah? Well I'm cow.
---
How does it work in EVE?
---
Just curious, if you’re able to explain it without spending too much time.
---
Earthfury has room for more :)
---
Yep... don’t need new gear till Naxx so they just check out and likely don’t come back.
---
Because it's a *time grind* not an *amount grind*.
---
If everyone makes 10k honor every 10 minutes is the exact same as everyone making 500 honor every 10 minutes. Literally nothing changes between those two.
---
The grind is to keep doing it in a month, it's not to do the maximum honour now because, again, that is irrelevant.
---
Same deal. It's still just 25% spillover. Just that your rep doesn't actually need to increase for there to be spillover.
---
don't be german :P
---
My bank alt is a female troll. The animations are hilariously bad and it looks like she's wearing a diaper.
---
I mean. idk about feasible.. I have trouble getting a 5 man done every day. But, yeah, assuming no responsibilities.. or something. 60 hours of WSG in a week is feasable
---
But everyone is saying this to themselves. Wont ever get easier imo
---
Pagle is trash. Trust this guy and roll on a good server.
---
undead is best race for a warlock
---
The only thing hunters are good for is Misdirection which isn't in the game till tbc.
---
I hope you didnt take part in any Fp/Neutral city ganking because now it was all for nothing.
---
Everyone who said that the wpvp slaughter was necessary for all rankers and not just the top 1.4% are about to get a wake up call.
---
&gt;Basicly got a bit ''how about you go fuck yourself for being here early and leveling. How play on another realm because you got longer Q for no reason'' will just quit the game entirely. 
---
Better than "how about you go fuck yourself for being here early as a minority faction and now after several days /played the game is unplayable because the other faction camps everything"
---
It's solely based on your server and your faction. 38K is a very small amount of honor, sounds like a very small pool.
---
I always report them.  I understand the idea there may be nothing wrong with it.  But it’s clear there needs to be a change to loot in BGs
---
Round 1 is going to hit with BWL I think.  Bad guild will start to die and the well geared pure specs will start to join other guilds and team up.  If MC wasn't puggable, I'd have left my current guild by now because they are kinda bad.
---
All for a tabard currently. 😅 A pretty one, to be sure, but a tabard nonetheless.
---
I don't see it.  Alliance have it pretty good for ranking on servers like herod and fairbanks, if anything this should encourage more horde to leave those servers if they want to actually rank.
---
Spot-on. I was playing EVERYTHING all at once, couldn't decide. Just discovered how amazing Druid is, and now I have a main. I love being able to fill all roles, plus it's extremely engaging and fun to play overall. Haven't encountered any problems so far as a Druid.
---
Firemaw EU... Progress, their alright
---
On the other side, I’m not going to run the dungeon up 3x the amount of times, one for each spec. Lol. If it’s not MC or Ony, I’m rolling on my normal main spec. Just because I’m tanking because, doesn’t mean my main spec for raids isn’t healing. And for lower dungeons, I’m definitely rolling on my heal and tank gear so I can continue to do either role effectively in 5 man dungeons. 
---
Now I do comment in DM, strat, and those others that I will roll on my healing gear. If you have an issue with it, I’ll go tank for a group that doesn’t mind while you spend another 2 hours trying to find a tank.
---
i had one for 2h15min or so, both sides summoned their bosses, it was very tense. we both got pushed into our own bases but we ultimately lost when a bunch of ppl got mad that they kited ivus and went afk
---
I’m not wrong about the ratio. I have two accounts I’ve kept track of this for two months. Horde population is 100% why every guild is struggling to find new recruits. Whereas alliance on this realm are not.
---
AV has way more real PvP than an open world gankfest. That's not PvP, that's farming.
---
Fits with the bland, sci-fi game ;)
---
&gt;Logged in today and was moderately surprised to see that after running AV around 4 hours each day last week
---
I mean, really though. 4 hours a day. It's a competition, and you're competing with people who don't work and limit their sleep. People have been saying since classic was announced that pvp is all about how much time you can put into it, how did you miss the memo?
---
Paid xfers killed my server and guild. Totally was a thing in Vanilla.
---
It’s mental gymnastics to accept that:
---
-the playerbase has gotten better at the game in 15 years
---
-being better at it now vs then creates higher competition
---
-inability to compete isn’t the collectives fault
---
???  And I never said ‘we don’t want you here’, you’re putting words in my mouth.
---
We do have a really good raid leadership too... which plays a massive part. Beyond that, I spend close to 20g per Raid night (2). That’s over doing it, but I’m not well geared compared to other members, so I try to pick up the slack when it comes to consumables.
---
Nog really. The rep grinders and holiday pvpers inflated the numbers a lot this week but in the lower brackets. That means that there are more spots in the top brackets. It will only get harder and more competitive from here on
---
Before the transfers it was 55/45 horde, now it's 60/40 ally at level 60... ruined our almost perfect balance with faerlina transfers
---
You need to understand that WoW Classic is game from 2005.  
---
It don't have a gameplay that could be close to LoL.  
---
Also it's completely different genre, where your individual actions matter much less.  
---
In the raid you need to avoid getting damaged, while dishing out maximum damage. And all bosses are immune to CC effects)  
---
Maybe PvP is the thing you are looking at. But then it's rogues that have the best tools with tons of stuns, slows, vanish and combat reset.  
---
Anyway, your leveling to 60 would be a boring. Either find groups of people to play with, or just stick your teeth, level to 60 and then start to PvPing.
---
Once again, where are you getting this info?
---
Wait what? Lol
---
Welcome to the Netherlands. It’s normal to be near fluent in English here (among the younger population). It’s even considered weird if you have no basic understanding of the English language. Most of us also speak at least German/French/Spanish in basic form next to Dutch and English.
---
Native English speakers don’t realize it’s not a flex to be bilingual, its more uneducated if you’re not.
---
The horde guy has two accounts. My buddy just had an alliance alt
---
Faction or just server?
---
Yeah, except it's a one time use. Which means you need the perfect conditions to want to use it and it takes up a bagspace slot. This is truly an evil item
---
Two people agree on a amount of gold to roll for. Then you roll x10 the amount of gold you rolled for, and roll what 1-what ever the other person rolled. The first person to hit 1 loses.
---
No it’s not. Wtf
---
A lot of people are only doing it for the AV rep. They're already starting to hit exalted and slow down or stop grinding AV.
---
In the configs, go to state config, and then paging. Should be able to set every bar.
---
I don't know but I'm not looking forward to more queues to get logged in.
---
Shadow Resist
---
Hunters can sometimes make 100gph but not consistently. I've solo'ed trib as a hunter maybe 20 and gold varies wildly.
---
But I did find Forors one time :-) oh well.
---
I tank in my off spec. I’m rolling on healing gear which is my main spec. I’m not going to run dungeons twice or 3 times as much in each role just because people get pissy. They want a tank? Then that’s the cost.
---
I am on a quite competetive server.. there are 14 people in bracket one and had over 1.5 million last week.
---
Linking my post from a similar thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/eblrp0/honor\_ranking\_realistic\_expectations\_week\_6\_update/fb77jxi?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/eblrp0/honor_ranking_realistic_expectations_week_6_update/fb77jxi?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
---
Kinda hope they bring in race changes to be honest, or at least paid character re-customization. My guy is ugly  lookin.
---
&gt;now it’s looking like rank 10 is going to only be one full time job with R14 being 2-3 of them.
---
Honestly, the pace will die off hard in time. You'll get more of people who put in decent hours, barely move up, and get disheartened all the same.
---
So this is saying smolderweb has 0 alliance players?
---
Got a 60 priest, 39 druid, 38 hunt, 32 rogue, 30 warlock, 29 mage and I feel like I haven't played that much
---
I disagree, rep grinders were mostly in the higher brackets and there's going to be a lot more holiday pvpers this week and next.
---
Ah okay, so you're saying even if I'm in the bottom 3 brackets it will only take 5-6 weeks to make rank 10?
---
Same here brotha.
