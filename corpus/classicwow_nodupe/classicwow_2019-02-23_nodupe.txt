How do you decide to put a guild down after 8 years, is the real question
---
Yea but even that undersells it. Purge doesn't stop your friend from being a useless ass hole for 45 seconds. Dispel magic do. I used to main a priest on Nost. For me breaking a sheep, trap, or fear is like critting to rogues. The big smirk I get is amazing.
---
This is a top tier satire post. 
---
It's a bit too on the nose, though. The real people who talk like this are delusional to the point of being handicapped. 
---
Pve bis also doesn't care about armor or stamina, those are pretty frigging important in PvP.
---
Looking at the """" Ele sham bis lists """" (who raids as DPs as Ele?!?) Its all cloth, no shield,  no mana per 5... Its a fucking disaster.
---
In the Classic demo shown at BlizzCon, there were sliders/toggles which let you choose between modern or vanilla shadows, water shaders and foliage. It is unknown if these options will be available in the release version. There were only original character/NPC models available, but it is unknown if they will add a model slider/toggle for the release version. They have been open to the possibility, but have not confirmed anything.
---
Overall it looks like it will be possible to get extremely close to the original look, and it also looks like you might be able to dial some settings all the way up to modern standards.
---
SoC is holy damage that bypasses armor, however it never resists because it still counts as a physical attack and can miss, get dodged/parried.
---
I wouldnt say theyre similar at all though, its the paladins analog to MS, but they work and are used in different manners.
---
If you've stuck with WoW or so long, then you obviously like it. Guild obligations or not, any rational person not enjoying themself would have quit by now. I say go with a mix, give it a few months then choose the one you enjoy more.
---
I tend to stick to similar bindings for all classes. E is for a mobility ability (Blink, Ghost Wolf, etc.), R is for an instant, typically not damage/combat related — like a shield or Mend Pet.
---
2 is my most frequent cast and 3 is the big cast or proc, etc.

Is there a way to get a slideshow desktop background on windows?

You can play at work best by not joining dungeon groups. Almost every time someone tells me they’re playing at work, *after* we get to the dungeon, they have to afk half the run or just leave.
---
That's genius!

On an rp server goldshire was always weird.

I feel a horde bias.
---
Are you talking about retail? Because you can just server hop if you start getting bothered.

But, but, but.... there's only 9 classes in vanilla. 
---
I assure you my findings are rigorously scientific
---
You really think they're not gonna stay in the same zone even if you had a 30 minute delay? lmao
---
I’ve had great dungeon runs with a warrior as a dps in the group.
---
It actually has some decent pvp uses.
---
* Good against ele shaman. Use AM immediately after they earth shock you, to 1) kill the grounding totem they will drop in a second, 2) pushback if they decide to cast anything else.
---
* It's also great against other mages AFTER they've already used up their counterspell. The damage and pushback helps you burn through their health a little faster.
---
* Against druids when they suddenly realize they need to run behind something to heal.

Is that Gamon down in the corner?
---
Yeah, can't have you enjoying the game *too* much. It should be a chore to enjoy all aspects of the game.
---
Yeah no problem, I just think that its a good you have a reason for using it. 
---
I always thought in classic allies could understand you if you just typed like this. A M   I  W R O N G  A B O U T  T H A T? I  A L L     W A Y S  T H O U G H T  S P A C I N G  W A S  K E Y.
---
Only elitists and poopsockers are against it because it allows them to dominate all aspects of the game. 
---
Maybe I'm a little OCD, but personally I prefer things to be laid out in an intelligent and well thought out way. If my years of evolution can help a new player, it will then make me more happy to be fighting with a more capable comrade, or against a more well matched enemy. Someone who can press any spell on reaction, without looking, or moving your hand off your movement keys. The ideal. I want to play with you.  
---
Movement: By default, the game does not have standard WASD movement like in a FPS. Some people prefer to have A and D bound to turn left/turn right so they can run around without always needing their mouse to turn their character. Simply holding right click then makes those keys function as strafe instead of turn. Personally, I prefer standard WASD with strafe keys as holding right click becomes a hassle when strafing a lot, but it seems pretty preferential to me. If you prefer to strafe or turn with Q and E simply swap the binds below for A and D.  
---
Okay you with me so far?
---
Main Bar: 1 2 3 4 5 Q E R F C X Z  
---
12 buttons perfectly filled, in a row. All within reach while holding W with your middle finger. Notice how the Letter Binds encircle your Movement Keys? This isn't some new discovery I know, but I believe in symmetry and completeness.  
---
Your second and third action bars can be exactly the same but with your preferred modifier (Shift, Ctrl, Alt) Pick the two you are more comfortable with. I always use Shift and Alt, while my friend with larger hands can't get his thumb over Alt, but can reach Ctrl like a champ.  
---
Further binds should take advantage of the following keys wherever you like (~, T, G, V, Mouse back, Mouse Forward) Personally, I use Mouse Back for Auto Attack on melee classes, or Pet Attack/Follow on pet classes, and hide this binding on a bar that is not displayed. I like ~ for my PvP trinket since it's right there and fast to hit. ~ is a good button for Pet Attack/Follow too. Not going to cover every idea, comment with your class I'd be happy to suggest what spell/action to put on your Mouse Buttons if you want. Moving onnnnn
---
To fix your default UI buttons simply adjust the following.  
---
Character Screen: K  
---
Chat reply/re-whisper: J / Shift-J-0
---
Sit: Ctrl-X (or Alt Whichever modifier you're not using on your action bar, remember?)
---
Sheath/Unsheath weapon: Ctrl-Z  (or Alt Whichever modifier you're not using on your action bar, remember?)
---
Unit Frames: Ctrl/Shift/Alt V for the 3 different display options.
---
Auto Run: Mouse Forward all day! It's the only possible option, the only logica!#!$!... Or whatever you want to put it on this isn't Soviet Russia...
---
Next step is to think about where to actually place spells. Number one thing to consider is your left hand. Think critically. If you are running with W and strafing with A and D, what keys are uncomfortable to press? I'll answer for you, because this is not a contest to see who can contort their fingers the best. While holding movement keys, it is not comfortable to press keys 1-5. 1-5 should be reserved for spells with a hard cast time, because you will most likely be lifting one of your movement fingers to press it. QERFCXZ on the other hand, can be pressed comfortably while holding W to run. So for casters, a good general rule of thumb is to have your most used instant cast spells on Letter Binds Q, E, R, etc. And to place spells like Frost Bolt, Healing Touch, or Mind Flay on your Number Binds, since you will be lifting your middle finger off of W to cast them. For you Warriors and Rogues thinking, "Pfft, I can Sinister Strike on 2 just fine bruh.." you can go ahead and bind your spells in a repeating grid over your entire keyboard and just roll your face over the keys while fighting, you will pull 1k dps at the very least. Haaa just playing, but really my expertise ends at the Hunter deadzone, for those of you playing melee classes I would just suggest to have your most used abilities on buttons that are easiest to reach. Simple advice :/ Moving onnnn
---
DRUIDS: 
---
That god damn bottom bar changing when you go into animal forms, so whatdo? What spells do you want to have access to, no matter what animal form you're in? That's right Beavus, ALL OF THEM. You need the EZDismount addon, so it automatically takes you out of animal form when you try to cast your spells. Your main action bar should be populated with abilities that can only be used in that animal form. That means you need ALL YOUR HEALS, ALL YOUR PVP ABILITIES, HIBERNATE, ROOTS, MACROS THAT WILL INSTANTLY GO BEAR FORM AND CHARGE/STUN, MACRO THAT WILL INSTANTLY GO CAT AND STEALTH, ANY OTHER INSTANT CAST SPELLS LIKE INSECT SWARM, MOONFIRE, OR FAERIE FIRE on buttons that are not on the main action bar. You need to be able to see/press the keybind for all of your spells regardless of the form you're in. 
---
*Posting for exposure while I think of more things to add..*
---
Paladins can AoE farm gold pretty easily with Spiritual Focus and Consecrate (shield spike will help too). Without concecration, theyre not bad in terms of single mob DPS.
---
I think the ret "stigma" will be realized when classic hits. To put it in perspective I knew a lot of Arms warriors that raided in Vanilla (it really sucks for DPS, ive tried it) and knew 0 paladins that were allowed to raid ret.
---
Ret in PvP is a big question, they can be very good is the short answer. The long answer, theres 3 ways to go about it; hybrid Holy/Ret, DPS Ret, Reck/Ret. Hybrid Ret, in groups youll primarily Heal and fight when taking pressure. For gear, the 1.10 PvP set and T2 are the kind of stats you loom for. Solid healing and Int with a good mix of Str and Stam. Youll be welcome in premades. Its not really a healing spec per se, but PvP isnt about maxing +heals and regen, its just about throwing out a few heals so your guys are alive and theirs are dead. In 1v1s, you rely on self healing to keep you up while you SoC your opponent down, but fairly short fights unlike a full Holy Paladin that grinds down an opponent after several minutes.
---
DPS Ret and Reck/Ret aim for Str/Crit/Stam and forget about Int and Healing. I dont really recommend DPS Ret because it doesnt make full.use of Repentence for pausing enemies to heal, as your gear doesnr give you enough mana to heal much. Reck/Ret is just fast paced all out offence on opponents to burst people down as fast as possible, healing is not in your name, just getting procs and bursting people down. Even though i consider Reck/Ret useful, most premades wont take them, nor DPS Ret.
---
For Rogue/Warrior, it depends on you. In PvE i felt no difference in terms of importance, youre either contributing to the massive healing pool or the damage pool. The most important ive ever felt is tanking, since the raids survival kind of hinges on you and as a Hunter pulling and kiting, since I kind of chose when things moved along and kiting is a somewhat unique role. In PvP, i kind of feel more important as a damage class simply because i can top the board from KBs, but I know plenty of healers that feel far more important as one of the few PvP healers ( a lot of healers hate PvP because theyre often left unprotected).
---
the ''raiding is already known'' thing bugs me soooo much, especially because most of the people who say it are laboring under the assumption that like retail, raiding is one of the only things that classic has to offer and everything else is just a slog to get to raiding. not true at all. and tbh in a good game, you would ideally have fun doing the thing even if you already know how to do the thing.
---
New classic guild "Streamer Campers" :)
---
I would let your enjoyment decide. Unless I misunderstood, you are currently abstaining from leadership duties. I’d imagine it’s quite draining at times. No need to force something you aren’t enjoying though. 
---
Dip your toes and you’ll find yourself preferring one over the other. No need for a decision now. You may not enjoy classic as much and find yourself wanting to play with your guild on retail. So do that. On the other hand you may find yourself not ever wanting to log in to retail and only wanting to play classic. In that case do that.
---
The nice part is even if you aren’t playing with friends on retail you will still be able to chat via bnet while on classic.
---
Very valid point. Must be satisfying! 
---
Especially once you get to tier 2 and beyond, one person's single mistake can wipe the entire raid. People in here still saying "heroic BfA raiders are gonna do Naxx ez" I call complete and utter bullshit.
---
Yes there will be a few top tier guilds that smash everything. But that will be the absolute exception, not the norm.
---
How hard are you pvping?
---
Warrior enables you to do both at a spectacular level. The problem? Getting there is hardest since warrior is one of the slower leveling classes..especially VS a warlock for comparison.
---
Both will most always get you a group invite though. Summon is just too good
---
If anything, they are pretty anti-streamer going as far as banning streamers if an event they hold causes server instability.
---
I know what i calculated.  I also know that 1-the chance you won't proc it is the chance you will proc it.
---
Paladin is number 1 on the list. Auto attack and healing seems boring AF. Hunter is close 2nd- huntard. 3rd is Druid. It was my first 60 back in the day, and won’t ever roll another. I want to be good at something, not ok at everything.
---
Sounds like you are describing a warlock.
---
But you could just as easily be describing the hunter as well
---
Alexensual would be camped even if they cared about streamers, and probably by one of his 5 viewers 
---
&gt; You've had a successful guild in retail so you can do the same in classic.
---
Not to sound discourageing but I really wanna add:
---
Being a GM in a successfull vanilla guild is A LOOOOT more work considering so many grindy/management elements thats removed from retail is back. ALso adding DKP systems/handling the council if you use Lootcouncil system. 
---
The common system guilds had back then, of which I experienced on a higher level, had a structure of this:
---
GM
---
2-4 Officers
---
A class-leader for each class (this guy is who you hit up if you need rotation,talent, enchant, gear etcetc advice. Theyre read up on it).
---
And often also "Profession Masters" in each profession. Since recipes were so effortly tied into PvE and its progress and had low droprates etc it was worth investing into certain loyal ones long term.
---
Shit was a lot more active and layered then. 
---
You should play horde.
---
Thanks!
---
Alchemy doesn't necessarily have to be on your main character. An alt at level 35 can max out alchemy and feed your main. Herb skinning is great.
---
When leveling id recommend two gathering professions to maximize your income (vendoring). Then pick after you've hit 60
---
I’d be all for it. I think adding some fun content like that is s great idea. 
---
Quality hunter with enh shaman work surprisingly well. my favorite combo by a mile. Not sure why it works, but it works. both classes are kinda tanky (mail armor) and dirty with tons of utility tools that can help and support each other, and work and play from each others abilities.
---
hunter is that type of the class that don't need full healing and just some help here and there. which works just well with enhs. and shaman are kinda masters of area control and slows, that works with a hunter, and hunter being ranged dps really helps where shaman gets kited. high mobility and area control for both these classes. this high utility dirty tanky range+melee combo just works wonderfully. 
---
Pretty sure it only drained Mana
---
So if I just have a raid schedule and not log on too much in between I should be good?
---
One thing I loved about the class. Makes me feel better I could get over the hump of mid levels.
---
would be awesome, so i wont need to launch dat shitty battle net in steam for using the steamcontroller any more
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
too sad its satire
---
Haters gonna hate 
---
no
---
The poor man's monk.

Hey I played with Yautja! Pretty sure that was when he got his Thunderfury!
---
Nope it came out as random gibberish 
---
Source - me and my friend ran characters on opposite factions halfway across the world when we were 11 to decode cross faction speech. The only thing we learnt is that lol = kek 
---
Do people in your current guild feel similar? Seems like a good time to put retail on hold and go kick ass in Molten Core together.
---
No
---
I saw 14,000,605 versions of classic WoW.
---
There was only 1 authentic classic WoW.
---
We're in the end game, now.
---
Awesome post. I felt like an upvote wasn’t enough for how awesome it was. I hope you guys enjoy the grind just as much the second time!
---
shoulders for my rogue for turning in tokens on that island in stv for doing zg content.
---
I like the NE wearing 2 helms
---
No but it’s OP on casters
---
no fucking way
---
Haha, if only.  I feel as if I'm one of the only classic supporters in the guild at times!
---
It would be amazing to have a multi-totem at the same time macro. I'd have one to counter each class. As it is if I run across someone in the wild I'll be lucky to put two of the most important ones down before it kicks off.
---
This is correct! It was the only Thunderfury &lt;Sadface&gt;/&lt;Virtus&gt; ever got.
---
Would you happen to know what a warlocks role is in bgs? Also, how bad is soulshard farming? That seems like an annoyance especially losing a bag slot but granted the utility of a warlock is awesome 
---
Taming as in hunter. He's got a pet ability that makes him a pretty good tank.
---
Crescent Staff!
---
The analogy was fine. The first premise of the analogy is that they defeated the boss(paying for your food) and was lucky enough to get a drop the wanted (mcnuggets).
---
However one person got extra lucky and achieved a mcforge (warforge/Titan forge)which gave him a better reward, for the same work.
---
The out-of-range thing was nerfed, but you can still use AM when you anticipate someone may line-of-sight you soon, and punish them for it via AM.
---
It's also a good optional pick in Frost builds, which lack any other option to avoid damage pushback on spells.
---
Lastly, it's actually a really strong option against casters, particularly the mirror match. If your main school gets interrupted, you can just cast AM. Not only does it deal good damage regardless of spec (as there are no talents to improve its damage anyway), but you'll also be giving your opponent a lot of damage pushback.
---
It's definitely a spell that PvP'ers will find themselves frequently using regardless of spec.
---
T3 warrior, of course. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I don't know the most about classic but from what I do know it seems like hunter is good for you in terms of dps (can get big crits on clothies) and for healing hpal maybe? Good in pvp and as a healet your going to do well in dungeons and have a lot of survival to solo things but don't quote me on that.
---
That's because binding anything else to your jump key is retarded.
---
Oh wow, that’s surprising considering how long you’ve been running your guild.
---
I largely play with the same group of guys I met during Vanilla. We play off and on, but most of us skipped Legion. We started texting a bit during Blizzcon and we all got the bug to come back for Classic. A week later, most of us were playing BfA together to kill time.
---
Who knows what everyone will be thinking when Classic launches, but I know myself well enough to know I can’t effectively split time between both. It’s just not my mindset to do something half ass and I know I won’t be able to be at my best if my time is divided. As of now, I plan to dump retail and go full into Classic, but who knows what changes in six months — maybe 8.2 will be the best version of WoW ever made...
---
...I’ll see you in Classic, lol. And if you’re looking for people to play with, a guild invite is waiting from a fellow lifelong Mage.

I thought he was memeing.  I upvoted him.
---
Sorry for the delete but no mana back.. however it’s over powered on casters.  
---
Viper sting:(rank 3 classic wow) stings the target draining 1108 mana over 8 seconds. Can be active on any target. 
---
I had a full tier 2 priest on vanilla wow and hunters were the only class that could really destroy me (considering they had gear) they could drain my mana completely in under a minute obviously rendering me useless.. haha pair that with a pet constantly attack you and a hunter firing at you with nearly instant casts and you’re practically done for. I think that’s why they ended up changing the spell in later expansions...
---
Costs you 215 mana with a 35 yard range.
---
YESSSS
---
Were these things really client-side?
---
Check out "Definitive Warlock Guide" which is a decent starting point for talents and basics.
---
Dual gather, likely vendoring the leather and stashing the herbs or ore to use to support whatever profession you want at 40 or 60.
---
I’d also suggest stashing things like cloth if you can (perhaps even the leather). All you want is the minimum for getting a mount at 40. Once you’re 60, re-evaluate the economy and figure out the best path to get an epic mount.
---
It really was a challenge, especially if you combined keyboard turning with a dial up connection! 
---
If you can change specs at will with no drawback what's the point in having specs?
---
People like having meaningful decisions. 
---
Hi, sorry, upon re-evaluation, this was removed because Halwin (the originator aka u/Halwin1) posts this from time-to-time anyway, so this is essentially a Rule #7 repost. Sorry for the inconvenience.
---
.... wtf, nice breaking the auction house enonomics :( real life currency? what the hell!
---
That was BoP :)
---
Wiping in WC is a right of passage for every Horde. 
---
I did this with the door to Scholomance way back in the early pitches, this was before &lt;Overrated&gt; got busted for exploiting AQ. I stopped doing it after they got banned. 
---
You could do other really awesome stuff too, like change your character model to another race or even an NPC only model. 
---
That certainly won’t be true. Barrens is going to be a mess at launch with competition for tagging zebras and shit. Alliance has more options to level and should be smoother leveling during that level segment.
---
A two handed sword called the Archaic Defender for my Nelf warrior.
---
Why should there be a drawback to every decision?
---
They already made a meaningful decision; they invested 300 hours into a certain class and several hundred more to get gear for whatever specs they want. 
---
Well that is some good to know information. Thanks! 
---
Classic is honestly called classic for a reason. There’s nothing like it.
---
It’s SO much fun. I stopped playing after hitting 70 in BC because I missed classic too much and it wasn’t the same. 
---
You WILL have a blast. Just know.. it takes a SHIT TON of time to hit 60, but it’s all SO worth it. 
---
So glad it’s going live- sick of all the private server bugs! 
---
I know you won’t be disappointed!
---
You're right about the threat, I had forgotten that Arcane Subtlety also reduced threat. And after considering it, while you definitely can't just spam spells and let the mob hit you all the time, having a good amount of stamina and eating often would allow you to safely cast arcane missiles when clearcasting is up. Assuming 5/5 in the pushback talent of course to not make it mana inefficient.
---
Back to your original plan of this build being for dungeons I compared the level 32 ranks of frostbolt and arcane missiles as frost and arcane/fire spec respectively and came up with the following numbers: 
---
Frostbolt Spam - 77.38 DPS, 1.75 DPM
---
Frostbolt:Fire Blast in 3:1 ratio - 85.10 DPS , 1.54 DPM
---
Arcane Missiles Spam: 83 DPS, 2.20 DPM
---
Arcane Missiles -&gt; Fire Blast -&gt; Repeat: 92.38 DPS, 1.9 DPM
---
You can compromise between the last two rotations by only using fire blast if clearcasting didn't proc, which might be the best general rotation.
---
The frostbolt rotations get a bit better at higher levels since there are more ways for frost spells to scale than arcane, such as dipping into arcane for arcane concentration or going deeper frost for shatter, though in dungeons it often breaks before your next frostbolt lands anyways. Still, the arcane/fire build and rotation should perform better most of the time.
---
I liked Ret pallies in BC. Gave them a cooldown and an instant attack, as well as some reworking, all of which they needed. Plus divine storm was just more homogenization. 
---
How do you kill that which has no life? 
---
I had a similar thing happen during a Molten Core run as a rogue. Except instead of PoM, I had Cold Blood permanently active. 100% on my abilities, it was awesome. I had a dedicated healer to keep me alive. 
---
At the start of a game you generally start out with your main crew trying to wipe the other team in mid because it makes it easier to support your FC and/or converge on the the EFC if you're not being peeled off of them. I respect that strats vary and the focus shifts with the flow of the game, but if you can establish control over the middle of the field it does make it a lot easier to play the objective.
---
3 letters in "wow"
---
must be something
---
To any people who have played multiple healers in Vanilla, how do you like Paladins healing playstyle compared to the other classes?
---
I’m not necessarily asking who you think is better, but if you’ve had more fun as a different class, or if you find yourself bored often as a holy paladin. 
---
Yeah, only that it’s not worth it. It’s cheating and you get the ban hammer. Sucks.
---
Oops haha read that wrong 
---
for op:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLmMHQErD88
---
They swapped the colors around. Shaman was originally pink, Paladin was blue.
---
I don't even remember why.
---
Both
---
The fact that Alexensual is your name of choice makes me happy.
---
Even with no gear as a hunter you can sometimes totally change the outcome of a group fight with little more than a few quick viper stings, it's great fun!
---
I am talking about retail prior to Cross Realm shard tech, also private servers and current retail without server hopping, aswell as other PvP games.  
---
Its a non-issue in all of them, always will be. Honestly ive yet to see stream sniping be an issue in any game at all.
---
???
---
Shamans can't use swords even in retail.
---
It does less damage per second spent casting. That's about it.
---
Would you consider leveling a Mage as melee just because you have an auto attack feature?
---
It was quite intentional since he doesn't see himself as a streamer for some insane reason :)
---
No, never.
---
Or dont google it and experience it
---
Ah I remembered incorrectly, he hired the Nost guy for his game development company.  I thought he said Blizzard did. 
---
So true and so OP! Lol 
---
You can do both. 
---
RMAH?
---
Whelps in badlands and the gators in SoS.
---
I think world PvP is a bit overrated. For the most part it boils down to high level characters ganking low level characters. I think the battlegrounds are a far better source for PvP since it's more of a fair environment.
---
I mean you say that sarcastically, but there is truth to it.  Guild A kills Rag twice. Gets 2 Band of Accuria.  Guild B kills Rag 3 times.  Gets 3 Shard of the Flame.  If guild B demands that the BoAs are taken away from guild A because guild B didn't get any, you'd think that was justified?  No RNG would kill the replay value of a lot of content.  I know because I played on a private TBC server where the &lt;61 dungeons (i.e. Azeroth dungeons) had bosses who always dropped exactly the same things.
---
At the same time, excessive RNG can be a problem too.  I've played phone games and it's rampant. Pay 50 or 100 bucks for a box with a *chance* at a usable item or unit.  If you want to be mad at how low the chance of getting something good is, fine.  Being mad that someone else got something better than you is just childish though.  And that's the subtle but important difference between "hey this game is broken because this mechanic is unfun" and "it's unfun that someone else has better gear than me".
---
Content is known - I didn't quit in cata because the raids were bad. Like the raid encounters were fine, interesting etc but i was still bored AF. I don't get bored raiding in vanilla as easily just due to how class mechanics and loot works. Ok i get bored in MC, MC is just boring. The rest though, love it.
---
No.
---
However these kinda Drained it and gave it to you. In reality, even if you hit a target with no mana you still gain the 8, but if they have mana you also drain 8, but still only gain 8 mana
---
Lol same!
---
DM E has some herb nodes which can picked after the lasher packs have been killed. Some extra money in that. Too bad this was before plant mobs were possible to herb, else the lashers would be worth even more per kill
---
Right on! Wasn't there some connection between Sadface and Og? I forget what it was but I remember them being the top guilds on the server. Man, I bummed hard when I saw them in BGs. 
---
Could you give us the original source?
---
I know it sucks ass, finally getting to play on an official classic WoW launch which might be the last chance we have to re-live that experience in our entire lives. But real life comes first for obvious reasons.
---
Classic WoW might release late August for all we know though, so you might be lucky in that sense.

Ah I read your comment wrong. I remember him dropping a shield that was a turtle shell
---
Awesome. I can't wait for people that are new to Classic to hit Ashenvale and STV. I think it's going to blow their minds. Especially when they see the same names over and over again and learn to hate people. Their hate will make them strong. I can already feel their anger. It gives them focus.

Adds such a great dimension to gameplay. Night time in the Barrens is a fav spot of mine 
---
1. Generally low-medium demand, its a popular class and has a large share of raid spots.
---
2. I think as soon as you hit 60 you want to switch to dw fury for raid DPS. The rage generation is just better, which only gets compensated when soloing because of rage generation from taking damage.
---
3. Moneygrinding sucks solo, really good with a healer buddy.
---
4. Theres almost no gear that goes to a tank that a fury warrior would use for DPSing.
---
As a note, youll find it extremely difficult to do 5mans without tanking. Most warriors make groups themselves and will refuse to take you to not compete on gear.

Vanilla UI was absolutley terrible. Zero room for customization. Youd get a lot out of a ui frame
---
I really hope that the devs figure out how to get weather effects into the new engine.
---
As of Blizzcon and the Classic demo, they did not have weather effects working in the new engine and even mentioned it as a challenge.
---
But it adds so much to Vanilla. Hopefully they get it in there.

Og? Don't know what that is. &lt;Sadface&gt; used to be &lt;Virtus&gt; then the GM of Virtus (Exivate/Varak) stole the guild bank and as far as we know just straight up quit WoW. He basically booted us all and quit, so we moved into &lt;Sadface&gt;.
---
highly doubtful. Considering the WoW engine will be on the 7.2. All that jazz has been fixed years ago.
---
Not Method, but we did out homework. I was in what could be called a semi progression guild in vanilla (like usually 3rd or so to get to stuff in our faction), and we definitely expected people to do their homework before new bosses.
---
Only time that wasn't available was the very beginning of MC; within a few weeks though strats started being out; we also already had figured out the whole certain specs sucks, already knew just about everything people know now about min/maxing. 
---
One thing I think some people don't think about enough is there was a bigger barrier/jump to raiding back then; majority of servers never got to the end content of any raid or even walked in the door (Naxx, but also AQ40, even fighting Neff was rare on some servers). Private servers are fun, I play on one, but I think you are getting a much more hardcore group there then you'll get on a release classic server.
---
...I got nothing. Fite me
---
The Warlock discord is very informative, can’t remember the details exactly however, you’ll be able to google for it though. 
---
Also, a Youtuber/Hardcore private server player called Alive is extremely good. Quite criminal how little subs he’s got as he definitely knows his stuff. Just be aware his guides are for Uber Min Max players, I don’t plan on going hardcore as I work full time but, it’s nice to know a few tricks. 
---
Hope this helps mate. 
---
Here's what you do to make yourself stand out as a DPS.
---
Get an equipment swap addon and set up custom gear sets. Optimize one set for bosses, and the other set for trash. Very simple idea and to probably the top 10% of players it's nothing new. In my experience from private servers it's an easy way to make yourself stand out above the 90% who don't do it.
---
Here are some screenshots.  
---
[1. Damage done vs bosses &amp; trash](https://i.imgur.com/O9ANNXV.png)  
---
[2. Damage done on bosses (successful kills only)](https://i.imgur.com/WmaYMhp.png)
---
Most of it comes down to small optimizations. I only hit capped myself on bosses that frenzied since a missed Tranquilizing Shot can cause a wipe. The rest of the time I wore 8% hit because with the gear that was available to me, 1% crit was a bigger DPS increase than 0.6% hit. Against trash I'd wear even less hit. Why hit cap yourself for bosses when you're not killing bosses?  
---
I farmed [Doomshot](http://classicdb.ch/?item=12654) every week.  
---
To compensate for my class' lackluster AoE I used stuff like [Ez-Thro Dynamite](http://classicdb.ch/?item=18588) and [Crystal Charge](http://classicdb.ch/?item=11566).  
---
I had a whole pile of trinkets that I would switch between for extra.  
---
When we were clearing trash in MC I dual wielded Dal'rend's with elemental slaying enchants because it was a marginal DPS upgrade to Barbarous Blade vs. elementals.
---
None of the stuff I did was revolutionary at all, but the fact that only a few other players did that stuff was enough. Try to think outside of the box, and actually think about why you do something before you do it.
---
Opening a portal to a capital city in pre-game Alterac Valley and saying "click for summon".
---
I was a MT and an OT for a guild that hit rank 80 world wide. I quit shortly after Cat, I was just too burned out. Here’s what I remember about being a warrior in Vanilla.
---
Whatever gear you can get to level 40. Spirit gear, yes spirit gear works better for leveling as it reduces down time the most.
---
At 40, get your whirlwind axe and then save up for an Arc Reaper. Pocket tank gear as you get it.
---
Here’s the trick that no one will tell you about tanking molten core for the first few times...
---
You’re a warrior, the best tank in vanilla, but you suck because you can’t build threat. Why can’t you build threat? Because your stats suck, there are going to be missed and you’re going to dump rage waaaay faster than you use it. So...learn to pot, learn to shield wall; Taunt will be part of your rotation, and heroic strike is a “wipe now” button because it dumps rage like no ones business.
---
Get that sunset armor up, and never pass up revenge.
---
Anyhow, here’s the trick about tanking in vanilla. The better gear you get, the worse tank you are. Reason is that you won’t get hit as much, and that means no rage. You will get to a point where you’re wearing nothing but a helmet, boots, maybe gloves, and nothing else...and one or two of the things you wear will likely be leather. 
---
As your raid gets gear, they’re going to become aggro machines, and the only way to save everyone is to generate as much rage as possible. It is then, when you have an endless supply of rage, you can get stupid and start dumping rage using heroic strikes and whatnot.
---
Anyhow, everyone’s job is to not stand in the fire, give you a few seconds to get aggro and then DPS their brains out. Super duper gear in vanilla wow will keep you rage starved.
---
Now for DPS, once you start getting good gear out of BWL, go fury (1Hs) and you will out DPS everyone, period dot the end. You will clown meters on melee focused bosses. You’re not going to be out dps’d by some rogue.
---
Finally, raiding as DPS, go fury and don’t be afraid to use a dagger in the OH. Find the slowest dagger you can, and the fastest 1H for your Main, and watch your damage skyrocket. 
---
GL
---
This could be poor advice but it makes sense to me. Level the warlock first, at least to 40 or so. The warlock gets a free mount, and you will have more than enough gold to funnel some into leveling your Warrior, whether that’s when your lock is 40, 60, or anywhere in between.
---
Warriors are so much more gear dependent than warlocks. A good warlock can level in pretty horrible gear at a very good pace, never needing to drink or eat much. A Warrior, on the other hand, will need to eat often, and a good blue weapon could let you kill twice as fast, and kill twice as many mobs before you need to eat. You could put 1/3 of the money saved from not buying your mount, around 30g, towards blue weapons for every now and then, level 21, 25, 31 etc.
---
Also, you may have an easier time getting your Whirlwind Axe questline finished later in the lifespan of the server. Getting anybody to help you in the first month is going to be hard, and you’ll have to do it closer to 40. That’s 10 levels you miss out on the feeling of being broken-overpowered.
---
Ideally, you should level both simultaneously, to get that rested xp going, also.
---
If you’re leaning towards rogue, I don’t think it’s a bad choice. Warlocks are very fun to level and are great at PvP, but their raid rotation is dull.
---
This is interesting, I might want to try this and make a spirit mage to get the most possible out of clearcasting, it might make for some interesting gameplay. Not overly concerned about efficiency or dps, but it might be fun to be the only mage in the game that doesn't ever need to drink
---
Shaman? In raids, they’re pretty much just healers, but on your way to 60 you can do a whole lot. 
---
Perhaps ele shaman, if you want to keep a safe distance, it has some serious burst. Ele shaman *destroy* creatures, but they aren’t mana efficient, so expect to drink often. 
---
Most of your gear will be intellect based, so you can easily heal dungeons without a hitch. Throw on a shield if you want some good armor, reap the benefits of a million totems, and experience one of the most open-ended vibrant classes in Vanilla.
---
DPS Warrior or rogue, both are pretty good at both.
---
As far as healing goes, shaman healing is more fun. You may only have 3 real healing spells, but druids only really have one. Chain Heal is super satisfying to use, and you will always be desired in a raid, mana tide totem saves lives.
---
&gt;maybe some more screen

Yeah, the dark nights and weather effects are super important to me. I’d be pretty bummed out if it wasn’t like in vanilla. I’d still 100% play the game. I’d just be kinda bummed.

Shift space for mount

No you bind mount to shift space retard.

That is why you are a scrub, a pleb, a stupid noob.
---
Gitgud but reality is after all these years you still suck, you will die a noon.
---
&gt;Alliance
---
Naturally.
---
Considering I live and die for the Horde, I wouldn’t know much about pitiful alliance portal magic. 
---
I was a nornal part of my dps back in the day, but since I had a lot of frost damage gear which I crafted frost spells were my top spells
---
I believe in actual vanilla, projectiles would hit as if the enemy was still within whatever state they were in when the projectile was fired, with the exception of becoming immune through ice block etc. So if the nova broke just before the last one got fired off, then I'd guess that only the first 4 would get the crit bonus.
---
I could be wrong about this mechanic though.
---
What is the purpose of this boss?
---
What's next, digital downloads? If they don't make it so that everyone has to use physical disks then this game is already dead.

---
Broooooo. I just saw this and my world stopped for a second. 
---
Warlock t3 imho
---
1. You'll be able to find a guild easily enough if you're dependable and a good player.
---
2. Horde that might be true, though things are pretty set on Alliance side. Your pre-raid BiS alternatives are Arcanite Reaper and Dreadforge Retaliator as 2H, and the Dal'Rend Set/Mirah's Song/Thrash Blade. There is also Ironfoe/Felstriker, though those are really hard to obtain.
---
If you're an alliance warrior, you'll want to aim for Dal'Rends/Mirah's/Trash and Ironfoe and Felstriker. If you're horde, you'll want to go for Dreadforge Retaliator first, but then continue to either farm the Dal'Rend's set or Ironfoe. Both will wield more DPS than Dreadforge. You could craft an Arcanite Reaper, though I'd put the bars towards a Lionheart Helm which you will never (ever) replace.
---
If you're playing alliance, you'll only ever use a 2H if you have BRE. No other weapon comes close to it (Might of Menethil excluded). If you're horde, as you get BWL hit gear it might start to outdps 2H, especially if you get Crul/DFT/Chromatic Boots etc. Also note that if you get an Edgemaster's you'll 100% do more damage as DW than 2H.
---
Provided you have BRE, you'll only want to move away from it late into AQ as it's still an insane weapon.
---
3. You should definitely go Engi/Mining and you should definitely do DME, they're by far the best source of money. You could also farm Eko's and sell them to lazy people, but if possible I'd make a schedule with a friend you find to farm DME.
---
4. Tanks and DPS warriors won't be competing for gear at MC, for the most part. Items that might overlap include:
---
The bracers off of Domo (which are crazy for threat, but BARELY better than the ones off Rend)
---
Onslaught Belt if your guild is ~ really ~ having threat problems (but by that time you'll have already killed Rag, so kind of a moot point)
---
QSR, maybe? I've seen it go to tanks, though I don't agree
---
Accuria, which should be prioritized to tanks anyways.
---
The bigger overlap starts in BWL with items like DFT, Maladath and Chromatic Boots which are excellent for threat while still providing very good mitigation. In that case, it depends on your guild's priorities. In my opinion, these should only go to tanks if your guild is really struggling with threat (and by that I mean 4-7 people constantly throttling their DPS in order to not pull), and even then it might just be that your tank is not doing something correctly/abusing consums.
---
Okay,
---
since you couldnt even comprehent what i was talking about. let me throw you a couple hypotheticals.
---
you are a disc priest, dala arena spammdispelling a mage-disc in their opener. you probably use some kind of shift modifer for macros ( in case YOU dont know what that is, you can write macros with conditions such as party1/2, player, target, focus, arena1/2/3) and you have to move in and out of loS so you dont get petnova- counterspelled from the mage. cant do that very good when shiftwasd is binded huh?
---
having shift on wasd is RETARDED.
---
That stuff is still there actually! :D
---
Even better is that some of your more respected Alliance could come over and duel too without being attacked by guards.  
---
Steam offers much more than just being a library. 
---
So amazingly this isn't a trick I was aware of, judging by the title I assume your General chat changed to Silithus? That's rather strange compared to all the other places in the game that do that.
---
"Pvp was too easy"
---
Oh buddy those people have a whole revelation coming their way.
---
I'm thinking warlock or mage. I want to do range dps this time around. Looking to mostly raid and do some BGs. Only thing about a mage that concerns me is the amount of people who usually play them and migjt be harder to find a raid spot.

End of the Thunderfury chain.
---
Paladin is simply the most boring seeming to me in every iteration of the game I played (stale and simple), plus I don’t play alliance.
---
For vanilla specifically out of the other classes, Druid. It just seems so weak? This is especially frustrating with the knowledge it gets strong in BC. Most classes have various strengths that can be argued for pvp, but druids seem pretty poor for everything except the niche of flag running or getting away in world pvp. Supposedly they are the worst healer in pvp with a lack of spammable heals, amongst other things. And the hybrid tax is bad in vanilla, and hurts them especially. Warriors being the only real end game viable tank really makes paladins and Druids in vanilla seem like they are missing out. (Shamans and priests at least seem a little more versatile to me.)
---
Meanwhile, warlock, mage, warrior, and hunter are all characters I desperately want to play in vanilla. Priest, shaman, and rogue seem interesting too.
---
okay then bigboy, got anything to back that up? you have any chars on wotlk unnamed 1xrate 0%buff server with buffed contend? anything else is below me.
---
&gt; For one, it has a (roughly) 50% chance to proc clearcasting per cast
---
This is what some private servers got wrong. Clearcasting can only proc on the first hit of any multi-hit move. If it can proc on all hits, you're right, AM becomes the most efficient single target spell by far. If you're playing on a server where this works, you should definitely go for it.
---
If clearcasting can proc on all hits, it becomes a little broken. This is why you see videos of people AoE farming where every AE cast triggers clearcasting. Once you have enough targets, you can just run around and spam AE for free on nearly every cast.
---
Thank you. This overall sounds reasonable. I’ll probably try to keep enough mats for levelling but vendor/AH the rest. 
---
/r/nothingeverhappens
---
&gt; but if there's going to be a flood of light leather and copper and no one has expendable gold yet, **is that a bad plan**?
---
a) yes
---
b) as someone who plans on being an AH kingpin - post everything you get on the AH for vendor price + 10% --- it'll sell, and hey, it's more gold than nothing, right?
---
Plus its the single most resisted spell type in the game.
---
   First of all I just want to say that if you have fun playing around arcane missiles because you like the aesthetic of it and you have found some nuance in it, then play it and ignore the haters.
---
    But as far as leveling goes, frost is objectively better in every aspect. The survivability of the spec is not only good for pve but pvp as well, and things like pvp matter while you are leveling unless you enjoy being corpse camped by the melee classes (roughly 35-40% of players will be rogues and warriors based off of private servers I've played on, not claiming it will be like this in classic, but it will be a lot of what you run into while leveling) As arcane missile spec, once your spell gets kicked you are locked out of arcane tree spells for a period of time, making you extremely immobile and vulnerable to stuns because you can't blink.
---
    If you are trying to level as fast as possible, AoE farming as frost is the best way to level in the game, only rivaled by hunter speed leveling. If you plan on just questing and doing dungeons your whole way to level 60, things like 100% increased frost crit damage and 50% increased crit on frozen targets make frost leveling insanely mana efficient while keeping amount of casts low.
---
At max level, specifically in molten core and BWL, the highest dps spec is arcane/frost spec revolving around spamming frostbolt. Arcane missile spam doesn't even come close. The only other option that tops the arcane frost spec is fire spec when AQ/ZG/Naxx are being raided.
---
With all of this said, I think you should play how you have the most fun, but to answer your question of "why people don't use arcane missiles as much as x y and z", it's just simply the least versatile of the three specs while having not enough strengths with too many weaknesses. 
---
I don't remember when this was fixed, but there was a graphical/pathing glitch in Orgimmar I found by accident on my gnome mage. I liked to go into Orgimmar and take out the NPC's in the inn and mess with the bankers and auctioneers. One time I decided to get on top of the AH and found a small section on the roof that looked normal but you could actually walk into, so that you were inside the roof but no one could see you. Other flagged horde would try to find me, and I would sheep them and emote them. There were dozens of horde looking for me but couldn't find me.
---
I've always wondered if anyone else ever saw this. I was able to use this glitch for a couple weeks before it was patched.

What do you mean rend is worse damage per rage? It's way better even before you consider that heroic  strike replaces your auto attack
---
Hi, /u/Fractales
---
Jesus... is THIS how people were able to duel in IF? I always wondered how the hell they did that. Hearing swords and shields clanking when Im trying to sort my mail and wondering "How can they duel here?".
---
True, true 😂
---
Nope. I remember after they added the drain it became useful in certain raid scenarios to viper raid adds with tons of mana just to refill your entire mana bar or a good chunk of it with a single shot.
---
Good times.
---
1. Fury competes for top dps through the entirety of vanilla wow, the only 2 other classes that can beat warriors are rogues(mostly fights where threat is an issue for the warrior) and mages once they can go fire in ZG/AQ/Naxx. Hardcore guilds rushing for server firsts are always very VERY fury warrior heavy. Highest demanded class by far.
---
2. As others have said in this thread, 2h is only viable as horde with windfury and as leveling. Dual Wield is far better and hit gear isn't that hard to come by, you just have to be willing to put in the work to get it. (warriors are the most gear dependent class in the game, but this honestly makes warriors the most rewarding in raids IMO)
---
3. Go either skinning or mining or both. Arcane crystals sell for a good chunk of money. Devilsaur leather is needed for every single physical dps class (35-50% of the server will be warrior, hunter and rogue) and fury warriors can easily solo Devilsaur (on a new server, literally 5-10 people will always be killing the devilsaur and there are only 5 in UnGoro on 10 minute respawn timer each) Side note: I've seen people say you can sell tank services, this is one of the biggest benefits of playing a warrior. You are the best tank in the game, it is the highest demanded role for dungeons. You can easily reserve a specific piece of gear you need and form a group in the fraction of the time it takes other people to make groups, or if you are against reserving items, simply only invite the classes you know won't roll on your gear.
---
4. This answer really depends on the guild you are in. Most of the gear that is good for you early on, you will get in dungeons and not replace until BWL or aq40. All of the warrior tier gear is itemized for tanks, but after a while you will get this gear handed to you like candy, especially if you are willing to tank on encounters that require more than just two tanks ( quite a few fights and trash packs, but not enough to take too much away from playing dps warrior) It is somewhat common for a tank to take gear that is Best-in-slot for fury warrior because he needs to build a set of gear that optimizes his threat (these items include things like Band of Accuria off of Ragnoros and Drake fang talisman off of ebonclaw in BWL) but after the main tank gets it, it opens up to the fury/rogue/hunters. As far as remaining competitive on dps, if you play the class right, and spend the time acquiring dungeon gear (things like Hand of Justice literally last you until you are clearing Naxx), and are using consumables, you will always be top 3 dps
---
You used to be able to change the curency values to read out as decimal (cant remember how ) but eventually it would overflow and 3 copper would turn into silver then gold when buying and selling items the more you fucked with it (Super early vanilla)(like as early as sheep skinning gives wool early)  
---
So it's not getting multi core CPU support... That's a shame with 40 man raids.
---
nobody seems to get that it's not the same as walking into a dungeon in classic and one of your groupmates getting loot while you don't. that's fine. it's doing a dungeon in classic and you both get idk whitemane's chapeau (example) but one of you gets the regular hat and the other one gets a hat with upgraded base stats and extra stats and a socket Just Because

These certain streamers are kidding themselves. Even if they played on a PvE server the game will be unplayable. If they don't end up crashing the server whenever they log in, they'll have a constant horde of stream snipers following them and killing the mobs around them before they even get the chance to tag it. PvE server is out of the question. The only way they'll be able to play Classic WoW is if they just don't stream it. 
---
&gt; PvP Servers would just be stupid due to this camping
---
PvE would be stupid entertaining wise. Everyone and their mother will play classic on launch why the fuck would someone ever watch a PvE stream residentsleeper leveling when someone else is providing a PvP shit show.
---
Was planning on going Eng on my Sham, definitely will now.
---
Leveling as frost is a blast though. You can take on either hordes of regular enemies, or take on elites. You have to utilize more than 1 spell here obviously, but yeah, raiding is a little less intense. I try to focus on everything else I can do to max my dps, positioning, cooldown/mana management, being the lucky bastard that gets Power Infusion, and of course trying to handle boss mechanics 100% as effectively as possible, because you don’t have to focus on the rotation so much. Although you will use other spells often, like for AoE, in MC, ZG etc.
---
If you want more PvP buffs then blacksmithing will give you access to [this trinket](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10418/glimmering-mithril-insignia).
---
If you care about where you land on the dps charts in raids, play mage. Locks and mages are both pretty good in pvp, but warlocks are bottom of the barrel dps until they basically beat the game (naxx geared) Both mage and warlock are easy to level, locks get their mount at level 40 for like 1 gold. Locks summon and banish shit and that is their main function in the first two raids.
---
Why? They're just trying to play the game like the rest of us.
---
Doesn't matter if the lowbie you're camping is being watched by 20,000, 5, or 0 people. You're still a pathetic loser for doing it.
---
Man up and fight someone who's on even or better footing with yourself. That's real PvP.
---
If you want to be competitive on healing charts, play a holy paladin or priest. Druids are a niche class that offer superior HoT's while being able to battle res, but as far as raw HPS they are bottom of the barrel. If you're playing for fun, that spec is fine and you will be able to find a laid back casual guild, but if you want to be in a competitive guild that spec will get a lot of criticism. 
---
If you're asking MY opinion on male night elves well... let's just say if i had a gun with 2 bullets and i was in a room with Hitler, Stalin, and the manifestation of every male NE in one single body, I would should the NE twice.
---
This is cute.
---
Did not exist until AQ.
---
I’m not sure if this has already been commented but if you leveled a mage to Lvl20 back in the day you would get BLINK and you could blink through and invisible wall in the game. Blink paired with SLOW FALL, meant you could go almost anywhere in the game. 
---
I think hunter or rogue would suit you pretty well for your playstyle. Hunters actually have a decent rotation in pve and are a lot of fun in wPvP. Hunters are also one of the best at farming gold and leveling. Rogues are great in the open world. Easy to avoid ganks/corpse camping while being good at ganking and corpse camping. 
---
As far as having time to raid, you'd actually be surprised at how much more time it takes to level and get dungeon gear than it does to raid. At a casual level you might only have to dedicate 4 hours a week to clearing MC or just looking for a PuG ZG/AQ20 whenever you have time (later on in vanilla is when the 20 man raids come out)
---
I agree with Warrior and rogue, but i'd also add Hunter. Though hunters are a notch below warriors and rogues in pve
---
I'm pretty sure stopping a frostbolt or fireball mid cast because your last spell procced clearcasting is a terrible idea. 
---
Amazing! Truly the best healers in the game. But you don't really need holy shock THAT much, you can skip it if you're specing BoSanc. 
---
If you care a lot about PvP go horde. If you want a marginally better community I would recommend alliance. As far as pve, there is a good debate on whether or not horde or alliance is better. I would argue horde has a higher ceiling but lower floor, where alliance is a lot more consistent and easy to manage due to paladin buffs. A lot of annoying edgelords play horde for the superior pvp racials. That being said, no matter what faction you play there will always be "that guy" trolling world/trade chat.
---
On a completely different note, I prefer alliance major cities SO MUCH more than horde cities. I can't fucking stand undercity and TB. Stormwind and Ironforge are just so easy to navigate and have a very cozy feel to them. But of course, this is just my opinion.
---
To start this off - I wasn't top tier at PvE or PvP. I played to have fun and accomplish goals with my guild. My first level 60 was a Rogue, but then leveled up a Paladin for healing.
---
While leveling I did go Shockadin/Holy-Warrior type play. Paladins have a bad rap for being boring levelers as there isn't much interaction aside from Auto Attacks and the occasional Judgement. However, I really loved the fact that I had to really TRY to die in combat instead of trying to live through a fight. It took longer to level than the rogue, but I certainly had more uptime as I could just manage my mana and constantly pull. I really did enjoy the nice holy crits to finish off mobs (Holy Shock -. Judgement of Righteousness -&gt; Hammer of Wrath) but because Holy Shock was on a 30 second cooldown, it wasn't the most advantageous way to kill anything.
---
I only did a little bit of WPvP but honestly cannot give you a thorough answer on their viability. I mostly just ended up healing instead of trying to do any damage. Tons of utility, and Holy Shock really was a life saver more times than I can count. 
---
I would say that if you were thinking of doing a Shockadin build at 60, it is wicked gear dependent to do any real damage, and in most cases, if you're trying to do a massive amount of damage, you'd be better off going Reck-Bombing with the classic /sit macro. 
---
I will be playing another Paladin come classic release, and I hope you try out Shockadin if you play a Paladin, but I hope that you don't expect it to be overpowered in the damage department, just learn to utilize all of the great utility parts of the Paladin kit.
---
You're unfathomably stupid.
---
It's a formula based on cast time.  You get the same amount per cast time as you would if you were spamming another ability.
---
Fireball and Frostbolt get a slight boost because they get a reduction in cast time.  So you get the SP coefficient of a 3.5 sec cast but it only takes 3 seconds to cast.
---
I think something between BC and WotLK would be the best Ret Paladin.
---
I think that about a lot of things in WoW, though.
---
Someone else did the math and saw it can do more.
---
So...there's that.
---
Not sure.  Never tried it.  It says "spell" so that could apply to the whole cast based on tooltip.
---
I remember that some spells were pretty wonky in how they worked in Vanilla.
---
no gnome mage REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
I just [couldn't find a definite answer.](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=14280)
---
Hi, /u/Sawyermblack
---
It's not.  You save more mana and you quite likely get the chance to cast more Arcane Missiles, which do considerably more damage than either spam spell.
---
I just have videos of my Pop-Pop fingering himself
---
This is an excellent question and I hope I can provide some insight.  
---
  
---
To answer your point, "no one has expendable gold yet", i think there are a few things to consider.  
---
First off is expecting proportional revenue to the amount of gold in game. If you're expecting to make actual gold within the first week, you will need to farm a hell of a lot of mats as I would anticipate the standard player having a very low amount of currency on-hand. That's not to say that you wouldn't be wealthy catering to these folks. If you've got 10g in the bank to the plebs that may only have 1g to their name, then you're doing quite well.  
---
Second point to consider here is that not everyone will be using dup gathering professions. If they are, then the supply may far outweigh the demand due to likeminded folks as yourself, and your revenue will be quite low. However, if it is expected that most players may take complementary professions (Mining/BS; Skinning/LW), then it opens up a venue for you to provide to a market that is in need of using their expendable gold to reach their own goals. That's when the demand for your lower tier goods comes into play - will they spend the time creating an alt to farm or go to the AH and purchase your goods?  
---
For an example of what I would expect to happen, check out True Iron Ore on the undermine journal, and on the daily summary, go to "all". What you see is a steep parabola from the first folks testing the price, to those that try to sell at a super short-term high price, followed by an undercutting storm leaving it at rock bottom. A bit of time later, you're seeing more purchases, slowly driving that price up. Granted, this is a bit skewed in this example, as they released equipment in tiers requiring this mat. The example in the short-term stays the same, though.   
---
So in short, you should expect to make money from these mats. You shouldn't expect to be wallowing in riches right off the bat, but depending on the disparity of players choosing two gather professions vs. complementary, you may have some good avenues of making money. I expect the AH to flood with mats and then quickly wipe out, but prices will be stable on the lower end. This will right itself several weekends post-release.  
---
I'm in the same boat as you for the double gathering - if you want to play it safe, cater to the needs of those that will have disposable income. Those needs come in the form of: Level 19's; raiding essentials (food, pots, flasks); craftable high-end gear.  
---
Me personally, I'll see you at the goldthorn rounds in Arathi. 
---
I've always been seriously impressed by people who know how to play the auction house. I never spent the time to try to figure it out.  
---
It's hard for me to stay focused on the subject. I know I'd gain more interest if I ever had any success though.  
---
I dunno if I'd hold out for a Burning Crusade server. I'm pretty sure the company would want to avoid a Yellow Wallpaper incident ("now we want bc servers" "now we want wotlk servers") and only considered classic servers because the pre-cataclysm zones don't exist anymore.
---
I have no idea what this means
---
Reason: am horde. Care to expand what you mean?
---
Wait im terribly confused. I had a Jintha alor group the other days with two hunters and one was always oom and they other over 75%.
---
He claimed it was viper sting giving him mana back...Was he just lying? Because the other hunter believed him and said he never used it
---
It’s odd that you somehow think that people didn’t try that back when TBC was current content. 
---
Oh my gawd, how dare you use common sense!
---
Unless Blizz goes full “we’re using Classic as a way to soft reboot WoW” it won’t happen. 
---
You can get the uncorrupted Ashbringer in Legion. Tirion cleanses it in Wrath and wields it from there on out.
---
It being in the game files doesn’t mean much. Martin Fury was as well, but that was clearly a joke item/GM item. There is literally no actual evidence that the uncorrupted Ashbringer was actually intended to be in game anytime before Legion. 
---
"And that's how I met... Abraham Lincoln." "Okayyy" "Yup. Abraham Lincoln."
---
Same.
---
That really won’t be possible in Classic. 
---
It’s quite possible on Private servers due to the size of the population. 
---
You’re awesome
---
Aww thanks Butt Bandit
---
if you just need toe zone to find them then just use /who
---
lmao
---
https://i.imgur.com/KI8NWA0.png
---
I think there was a non-mage version of that glitch, that involved some rooftop jumping
---
** casts Rebirth **
---
&gt; (I suspect they mostly are)
---
Laughs in Flame Wreath, Netherspite beam mechanics, chess event, and countless rooms that would never fit 40 players. 
---
The same reason they watch a guy try to climb a mountain instead of the guys showing off actual new stuff, personality.
---
I clearly remember blowing people off of their slow flying mounts, as a mage in TBC. 
---
So I don’t it’s even mandatory if you were on a PVP server. 
---
As long as it's not Leatherworking, Blacksmithing or Tailoring then each of the crafting professions can create reagents that are somehow used in Engineering.
---
IMO Alchemy is useful.
---
Gather and hold, wait for economy to even out.
---
Hold on. How can you play at all when there's Rule #1 AND Classic wow wasn't even released yet?
---
Wish I could hit you
---
&gt; easier quest information, where to go
---
😬😬😬
---
Same way you fit them all on a keyboard, use modifiers so buttons can do double duty or more.
---
As a streamer, 100% this.
---
Protip: Everyone still currently playing retail WoW is just "some pleb".
---
I wonder if this is part of why "more people raid Horde". Lack of Paladins requiring better tanks, then when Horde gets Paladins in TBC classes are equal, and Horde has better skill.
---
Then you killed off your entire clan
---
Surely this is a troll/joke post. 
---
&gt;  Clearcasting can only proc on the first hit of any multi-hit move.
---
Not Arcane Missiles.  Patch 1.9 changed it specifically for arcane missiles.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.9.0
---
The problem is, I don't want to have to raid heal to get there.
---
I thought this discord was just for warlock RP?  
---
Go where the most fun is, let all the other details fade away.  
---
I can totally hear the selection sound going off in my head as you move from character to character.
---
Should of used a snowmobile 
---
"DPS" meters arent solely for DPS though. The problem is that they always seem to default to DPS/dmg. This is reasonable though as DPS is the easiest metric to judge against. "Not killing the boss fast enough" is something everyone can understand. The other metrics are likely more narrow, and people are too lazy to use them (because meters are always marketed as "dps meters")
---
sadly the toolkit just doesnt allow for interesting flashy plays. so even a very good paladin will just look blend in a video. think thats the biggest reason there are only a few.
---
A lot of Monkeynews' greatest moments aren't flashy at all. They're methodical, that's why they're so interesting to watch.  
---
Lol I mean dude all you need to do for Paladin highlight reels in a premade is to watch a warrior’s perspective. Watch when the freedom hits and his health bar goes back to full from one heal crit. 
---
But for actual pvp aside from reckbombs Paladin pvp revolves around judgement spam and holy shock. With the sustain and damage they can have after t2 swaps over to spell power plate they are actually a fight in most 1v1’s using all their tools. It’s usually a slog tho.
---
This is actually a super good supporting build tho since you’re deep holy. So if it’s world pvp as soon as you get backup you can ya know, peel like 600 or so damage off somebody while being a bomb ass immune healer for whatever your backup is.
---
I played an arcane mage / priest 2 box through TBC.  If you are soloing alot, its hard to ignore how bad ass frost is.  But with a priest to throw down pw:s i gotta say i loved leveling arcane.  
---
Your general chat changed to Silithus, you got pvp flagged when you played on a pvp realm, you were able to do things you couldn‘t do in cities like starting a duel, mounting up etc.
---
There was a bug, when you were behind this pillar right to the bank entrance that your location suddenly changed to silithus even tho you were in ironforge. It was a location bug that lasted fairly long because blizz didn‘t fix it. Everbody used this bug to start duels in the middle of ironforge.
---
I’ve always used ESDF instead of WASD since Starsiege: Tribes as it gives me access to more buttons on the left. May not make a difference for people with smaller hands, though.
---
Saw a reckoning paladin beat like 6-8 players who all happened to attack in turn. Was pretty awesome and he used basically the whole toolkit, but reckoning's there only burst so it's hard to find any good pvp without it.
---
All the warrior sets and pala tier 2. Also like druid tier 1
---
You aren't "lucky enough" to get what you want when you pay - that is exactly where the analogy fails. It's lot like you buy gear from a vendor and it can forge, that would be the McDonald's analogy equivalent in game.
---
Forging now is exactly like a lottery, where as in classic it was like a raffle. I don't like lotteries in game because the odds are too high, raffles are ok because the odds of getting what you want are much better. 
---
Should have used proper grammar. 
---
Not an experienced played here, but I was told paladins are quite fun as raid healers and pocket healers, because they have some upper edges over other classes. 
---
In raids, they have faster heals through *flash of light* than other classes and therefore have more healing done, which, as I had heard, is quite an enjoyable experience. 
---
As pocket healers, they have a lot of situational tools to avoid sticky situations as well as they are hard to kill. BoF against Frost Mages, BoS against pretty much anyone, and all the other things like bubble or lay on hands.
---
Are they fun? From what I heard, they are quite strong in both PvE and PvP and therefore are a lot of fun. As I said, however, I'm not an experienced player to tell the differences.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9372/sulthraze-the-lasher
---
even better :&gt;
---
Yea sorry, I should have worded better, I just meant AH fees in general, thanks for the catch ^^
---
You are reading far too deep into the analogy my friend. 
---
The point was that one person that had done the exact same work got a much better item, simply because of luck. 
---
Can you interrupt a paladin casting a spell while bubbled with things like *kick* or *earth shock*? Unexperienced player here.
---
Do everyone else a favour and be a healer 
---
Or dont roll the Class in the first place
---
This.
---
Just go panda alliance shaman!
---
&gt;They edited some stairs into something small and were able to get to him immediately
---
They edited the stairs into a chicken. The entire guild got banned btw, not just the raid.
---
**In PvP**, what are paladins' best and worst matchups, considering both sides are equally geared? 
---
No, they are immune to every player effect or damage while bubbled.
---
I fucking miss going to STV at night, with the rain completely pouring down.
---
A lot of people complain about how retail WoW made nights too bright, which I agree with, but I rarely see anyone complain about how retail WoW got rid of weather affects.
---
I can’t remember the last time I saw a shit ton of rain in WoW, if any at all. It must have been before Cataclysm.
---
The economy works how you'd expect, rare valuable stuff is worth more. What's rare and valuable? What's not in the AH yet? With thousands of players in the game, the only rare items are higher level items. So it really just comes down to a leveling race. The further ahead you are the more you can jack up the price because you'll be selling to people who've jacked up the price of their stuff for the players below them.
---
If you're with the pack you'll be broke so don't buy all your skills and don't buy from the AH if you want a mount at or near 40.
---
Tragic vision, but it's the truth. ;)
---
Oh yeah!
---
So it works in PvP but not in PvE... which is not like private servers at all and is the point of the comment chain.
---
Get an MMO mouse, you have like 12 buttons all accessible with your thumb. Takes a bit getting used to, but super easy to use. Also your PvP will see dramatic improvement
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOXrGmulbMk Personally like this oldie but goodie.
---
Tipsout did a good video which went over rotations and gear and stuff check his YouTube. Pretty insightful. 
---
That's a vague description, but I do hope you're right. AM can have an interesting niche if it can proc on each hit.
---
For sure. Here's my toon, early TBC still in vanilla gear https://i.imgur.com/UmKbHoE.jpg
---
Back when you didnt see the WSG flags on the map, I used to hide as a flag carrier in plain sight at the flagroom.
---
You could wall jump the pillars next to the flag pit and get really high so you couldn't be reached and if at the top you used /sleep it would hide the flag inside the wall. A similiar spot was near the ballistas outside the flagroom, in the corner near Alliance graveyard. You had to walljump to get between the vines or something iirc.
---
Yeah, patch 1.0 forever. I want the game I paid for warts and all. 
---
Is there any exception? 
---
Biggest lie ever
---
Nope. Zilch you can do to a pally in bubble in vanilla. In TBC they added mass dispel but nothing before that.
---
&gt;professions at level 1
---
Instead of level 5? Horrifying, I won’t stand for this. 
---
There is genuine decreased visibility at night in Vanilla WoW, and that's cool as hell.
---
I really hope Activision Blizzard manages to recreate the visuals and don't dumb it down for the general audience like they did retail.
---
i love night in wow
---
its a lot easier on the eyes
---
Interestingly, how you make money off a late economy is the opposite of this, you take advantage of the rich players with disposable income.
---
Jack up the price of copper, if they happen to be leveling engineering right then and don't want to be delayed they might be willing to pay way too much. Twink items too, auction them for insane money and those rich fools'll pay it. They know they can earn a hundred gold in a few hours anyway so they'll pay a hundred now rather than wait a few days and hope the price will come down.
---
Funny story actually
---
cry
---
Never played one myself but I dont think you can solo much more than lashers since the sit macro will not work in classic.
---
It's amazing the most downvoted comment has the real up to date for 2019 advice.
---
You people are gagging so hard on shit binds that don't use OP combos like scroll wheel and shit binds like f1-f5.
---
This would impress player maybe 7 years back. Really shows the general skill level of wowservers honestly. 
---
while that is true it doesnt represent what makes 90% of popular vanilla pvp videos popular in my opinion.
---
i was not saying you cant create good pvp videos for classes with non flashy toolkits im just saying the latter is a big reason why they are comparably less of those classes.
---
definitely I'll remember. That unlucky year, when it was raining all the time in my town. And, in WOW, it was raining a lot. People were complaining about that on the forums.
---
Then, all of a sudden, it started to snow in Stormwind. In the middle of June.
---
Also, I'll never forget how I had to clean my monitor, because it was nighttime on the server, but still sunny IRL, and I could see nothing but dust on screen.
---
&gt;going to STV at night, with the rain completely pouring down
---
Yes, tropical rain in STV. The flight from Stormwind to Rebel Camp. The time when you hear the ogre music of Duskwood's ogre camp, and in one specific point of the music, you know you'll start to hear Stranglethorn music.
---
But, that day, I heard rain instead.
---
No idea but one thing is for sure, gold is much better from AoE farming as you can get random drops and cloth from humanoids which will help your tailoring a lot.
---
Shocked nobody has said rogue t2. Iconic.
---
Old models? You mean the correct models.  
---
The new ones look like disney was consulted to make them
---
It's the fastest if uninterrupted. Faster than hunter or any class.
---
Prior to 1.9 you would have been wrong. 
---
Is it at all possible to hide your realm or character name?
---
But ganking streamers is surely more fun than ganking anyone else.
---
Why not make it Epic games store exclusive instead?
---
I started playing from day 1 and didn't even have disks because the store I preordered from didn't get enough copies and I missed out. So I got someone else to buy me a copy in another town and text me the key.
---
What the fuck are you talking about?
---
No, blizzard have already said it was fake.
---
Its doesn't mean that will work with am, spell tooltips ironically often wrong. 
---
Seen few videos with mages spamming am and they got clear cast proc only on start of am. 
---
So you killing 8+ mobs in one pull, while Hunter killing only 1, simple math. 
---
Shockadin is just basically heal pala so lol. 
---
I guess the problem are not the streams but the amount and age of their following.
---
"but can't find any official-looking source for this rumor."
---
Which usully means its fake. 
---
They could cover it all up on stream, but it wont take long for someone to scour every realm and find them. It happened on every stream I watched for the demo. And the demo had sharding too. And once the streamers been found out, everyone will know.
---
Paladin t2 is obvious but Paladin t3 is also extremely good looking.   T1 is garbage though. 
---
I think its better to wait for 22 so you can have cold snap and 2 imp blizzard though, The reason i asked is because every 1-60 speed leveling attempt is made by hunters and sometimes warlocks.
---
No:
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=288412/blizzcon-2018-wow-classic-interview-with-brian-birmingham-and-john-hight
---
Hunters have no downtime and they can kill 2 mobs at a time... But I wasnt trying to compare to hunters... I'm thinking questing mage vs aoeing mage. And the reason I ask is because every 1-60 record  that ive seen is made by questing with a little bit of grinding
---
Yes, it is true.  
---
If you don't believe me, [here's a link to the video where they said Nost devs are on the team](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gullible)
---
Nobody is rating it from a fairness point of view. It just adds a lot of immersion to the game and some "real danger" when you are wandering around outside your city. It also creates very epic situations outside of raid entrances.
---
The reason why you see those is because almost no mage goes uninterrupted to 60.  
---
When I level mages, I just level with the AOE spec even while questing, and then if by some miracle I see an AOE grind spot open with no one around, I'll do as many rounds as I can before someone comes along.  
---
Sorry but first hunter was likely just autoshooting :p
---
Since when PvP stands for "Consensual, fair terms player VS player?
---
I'm the other way around and considering horde 
---
Well, entertainment wise they will run BGs and Instances and Raids and do Events with Followers and all that stuff. Having people camp your corpse from level 1 onwards is not entertaining to anyone aside from those camping the corpse so...
---
I'M A PALADIN!
---
hot
---
I'd be curious to see if ANYONE has a video from retail Vanilla showing two Clearcasting procs during the same AM cast.
---
If there really are five rolls per cast then it should be fairly common to see a first proc from the 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th volley of missiles then a second proc (that would just refresh the buff duration) from the 2nd, 3rd, 4th or 5th volley, right?
---
I mean, it mathematically should have been common, but I have yet to see any footage showing it.
---
However, there are definitely videos showing that the Clearcasting proc of the first tick actually happened before the target was even hit, but when the spell mana was actually consumed instead.
---
I agree that the talent tooltip is misleading, but this was really common. Not to mention it is absolutely certain that Arcane Explosion did NOT have a chance to proc per target, however the tooltip from the Clearcating talent would suggest that it did, proving that the tooltip was in itself not accurate. I think that with the mention to "when you deal damage" Blizzard referred to the fact that this talent only affected offensive spells, not self buffs or whatever, and that's it.
---
I think it is more plausible that the 1.9 patch refers to a bug that prevented Arcane Missile to trigger some other "on hit" effects, or other spells or talents from the target that would be triggered every time damage was taken and that AM wouldn't have a chance to proc before the patch.
---
If anyone has a solid proof or a better explanation, please share it :).
---
imagine going to the lotto, ticking 6 numbers, and pay 3$. Then some other guy ticks the same 6 numbers, and too pays 3$. You win 10000$, and he wins 20000$, because he got JokerForged.
---
Now, imagine some other guy who chooses another 6 numbers, and wins 35.000.000 $, because he got \[Legendary\]
---
Then another guy chooses another 6 numbers, and gets nothing but \[Artifact Power\]
---
Warchief Alexensual vs King Asmogold.

I used to do a lot of AV as ret. I remember destroying shamans like they weren't even there and beating warriors, hunters, mages and druids 1 on 1 routinely. Warlocks and shadow priests were really hard.  Don't even bother duelling other paladins. One of you will die IRL before it's over.
---
for me it's the other way around. I tend to focus on one or two things, until I master them, only then increase my range of interest.
---
That is, I keep watching copper ore prices, waiting for a bargain, for 2 months... and then get bored with like zero income.
---
If you want to be super valuable in the raid, use a Nightfall axe and keep the buff up on whatever the mages and locks are shooting. Your personal damage will suck but you'll be responsible for more damage than anyone else in the raid.
---
&gt;The economy works how you'd expect, rare valuable stuff is worth more. What's rare and valuable? What's not in the AH yet?
---
Rare and valuable is gold.
---
Anyone can post the first devilsaur leather for 40g. But why waste your deposit?
---
Classic AH is more of a resource/currency market, rather than goods.
---
Warriors are technically more 1 dimensional compared to BC, but better at what they do (huge burst). 
---
Even though engi, and trinkets/consumes were still somewhat common in BC, still not as much as vanilla and if you go places prepared you have enough tools to outplay almost anyone with gear.
---
And the thing is a lot of players like myself didn't even raid much but still loved the game for the community, levelling and dungeons. I never completed molten core and I can't wait for classic wow 
---
Kargoz's class guides are pretty in depth and entertaining to watch.
---
Shaman, Lock, or Hunter.
---
Didn't Blizzard change the tagging system some time during Cataclysm when Athene got world first in a couple of hours because he had an army of fanboys tagging for him?
---
Anyway it's the servers that handle the game rules not the client. Unless Blizzard intentionally changes the mob tagging system in Classic it should still work the same way it did back then.
---
But who knows? No way of verifying it without access to Classic.
---
I play on a private server. Nothing changed, people are still clueless. Also, people are going to wipe big time on the trash in MC.
---
Questie was a vanilla add-on. It had coordinates, a giant arrow over your head pointing you in the direction you needed to go, map and mini-map integration, and it modified the tooltip when you moused over things to let you know they were part of the quest. 
---
I was 60 before it came out but I used it to complete every quest available in vanilla and level alts. 
---
guess i also have to explain... if the player base doesnt grow, its not infinite grow &lt;insert pikachu meme&gt;
---
AoE farming is faster than everything else. Only limiting factor to its effectiveness is the amount of competition nearby and your movement speed.
---
It's a good point for sure. A good play by a non-flashy class would be harder to see for what it actually is for a casual viewer.
---
Hard to make a highlight reel of auto attacking with the occasional freedom
---
One thing I've been trying out on pservers is to unbind the move forward key and to use toggle autorun (bound to middle mouse button) instead. 
---
Seems to work pretty well so far.
---
I don't really like casters that much, I was looking at shaman since frost shock is good for kiting and instant, but thanks for the advice I might try those classes out once vanilla launches to see if I like them
---
I hope they force Alexensual to play on PvE due to endless griefing. 
---
how fucked am i pve wise if i actually want wear plate like the class description promises me?
---
dude swallow that pride jesus christ. you were wrong. 
---
even the point you are swerving to in hindsight is retarded- who cares if you are brit- this is reddit, the internet - you cant go "correcting" people for speaking american english while thats what just about everybody except australians and brits are speaking here. I dont flame people for saying Turtle instead of the dutch word for turtle either.
---
even on pve servers big streamers will get streamsniped through killing mobs and quest givers but it was their choice to become one so own fault
---
While leveling, the top level gear goes for a lot. I'm speaking from experience. Maybe they SHOULD save their money instead of spending it, but that's just an opinion. 
---
Also, blues aren't worth a ton because no one has the cash for "bulk" purchases like that, meanwhile they might spend everything they have on a green that's only slightly cheaper.
---
What do you mean "figure out"? They didn't get removed because they don't know how to do it or the engine isn't capable of it. It got removed because the vocal majority didn't like it.
---
Why wouldnt you want to play cloth in raid and plate outside? Thats what paladins do
---
I honestly don't have any pride, in this case I will admit and say it really depends on where you come from. In america it is correct, but in Britain it is not. 
---
If I was prideful about it, I would have insulted you, and your intelligence, which I am not going, that'd be quite the dickmove.
---
Memes didn’t exist in 2004 so no. It was a shit spec 😂
---
Lol perfect.
---
&gt; they'll have a constant horde of stream snipers following them and killing the mobs around them before they even get the chance to tag it.
---
I honestly can't understand what interest/fun people have in this kind of behavior.  
---
Like, do they think they'll become notorious for having harassed a streamer?
---
because if i wanted to play a scuffed priest im gonna roll priest. Want to wear my plate in battle, not as glorified transmog
---
On that note i also read that for some classes their tier gear is shit and they dont use it at all/just pvp. Is this also true for paladin?
---
I'm leveling Hunter atm, 36 lvl, cat pet, so you can't chain pull more than 4-5 mobs, two mobs at same time isn't really worth, because yours mana drains alot while you using multi shot. 
---
I prioritize agi&gt;spirit&gt; other stats
---
Check out Drakova 
---
As am patch 1.9 fix i think it's about new proc caster items, iirc there no caster proc items before aq content
---
&gt; "Raiding content is known". 
---
I would like to add here the "Raiding in Classic will be easy" mantra, which is like a given because "Raiding content is known".
---
People who say all the things you mentioned are people who never played Vanilla, be it the OG or on private servers. But they are also morons.
---
I mean, look at Method and other top retail guilds. They deliver full raid content and tactics (thanks to alphas and betas) months before the raiding is live, and even in these conditions, most retail players are unable to finish heroic raiding more before the next raid content is live. They have all the information, but they still suck.
---
And why is that? Simply because most players (retail or Classic) are too lazy to inform themselves and unwilling to dedicate to raiding (for different reasons).
---
The biggest advantage of Classic is the fact that a player can spend his entire time without raiding. There is SO MUCH to do in Classic outside raiding, as opposite to retail, where raiding is basically the game.
---
I had friends and guild mates (lots of them) back in Vanilla that NEVER raided, yet, they were always playing 4-5 hours/day. They were doing dungeons, farming materials for the guild, WPvP, working on reputation, leveling alts, or simply TALKING with other players. 
---
The social part in Classic is extremely important, and it will be the main thing that will keep players in Classic even if they won't raid for months and months after hitting lvl 60.
---
I, for one, can't wait to see how all of those people saying the things you say, will cope with the reality.
---
Or not, because they will quit before lvl 30...regardless of how much information is out there.
---
When I call in my guildies to help with a camper, I always make sure they take turns 1v1ing. None of this 2v1 or 3v1 stuff, CFTPVP is the way to be. /s
---
On a totally empty server it sounds possible. But then you're talking about a private server and all speed records on private servers are suspect for a bunch of reasons.
---
This was not changed in tbc. If they will make it authentic, they will not change how this works and tagging/boosting will remain.
---
Streamers will most likely roll on PvE servers.
---
They will just get roflstomped on PvP servers, and they know that. None of them will want their stream to be 70% ghost corpse running from GY to the body.
---
Especially in massive zones, where the run is really really damn long.
---
Yeah...you really have NO IDEA about WPvP in Classic.
---
You think is overrated? Sure it is.
---
See ya in Ashenvale, STV, Tanaris, Badlands, Searing Gorge, Blasted Lands, Un'Goro, Silithus, raid entrances. 
---
Also INSIDE your capital city :)
---
Orc or gnome, others suck
---
Warrior need good gear, at least r10 and zinrokh or av mace and you will be pretty decent as pvp player, orc can do good burst and rng stun resists, gnome feel fine vs slows/roots
---
And engineering must have ofc. 
---
Pocket pala/shaman makes you just hk machine, but even w/o heal  you can do some serious shit.
---
BUT! if you don't have a gear you will be beaten by anyone. 
---
I mean warrior scaling with gear better than anyone else. 
---
So naked warrior is 1, naked mage is 10
---
Geared warrior is 20 geared mage is 20
---
But anyway all depends situation, world pvp, random players bg, premade bg. 
---
So the Seal of Righteousness build was not included, since they already stack spellpower and mana they might be ok to bring for the buff and possible a healer when needed. I am intrested in how many healing talents they can get without sacrificing dmg.
---
Since getting together enough paladins was a bit harder then i thought when playing alliance, since not everyone wanted to heal we had a retribution paladin to get enough paladins together for all the buffs.
---
I love when people try to make an argument based on "Well, your  damage is not the best one, but on the other hand you bring some utility, so it is viable". 
---
It does work in certain cases like druids with 3% aura, but not with paladins. You don't bring anything holy paladin can't bring, but actually you bring less, because rets are kind of stuck with Sanctity aura instead of something useful holy paladin is going to use.
---
It was capped, in WotLK atleast, to 10 mobs worth of damage, after that the damage was reduced evenly for each new mob
---
You're not wrong, but this is about Classic WoW so there's no AoE cap. 
---
The Aoe cap wasn't introduced until version 2.0.1.
---
Since iv never played a paly before this is pure speculation. What if a ret paly used the axe Nightmare? +15% to all spelldmg is something everyone will benefit from. maybe that can make it a little more viable?
---
In my case, playing the Ah is something i would do while at the office. run the game in the backround, update the Ah every 30 min, check prices but the things i feel might have value and any under priced green item i can disenchant for a profit. 
---
I'll bite.  What looks wrong with it?  I don't personally prefer it, but it looks completely functional to me.
---
From what I saw in Asmongolds classic demo stream, they all just looked like they wanted to chill with him in game. The side effect of it was just a negative for him.
---
Of course there are people who just enjoy stream sniping. I don't think it's a notoriety thing. Imagine being able to see the reaction of the person you ganked in vanilla. It's a satisfaction thing. 
---
It was, badger badger badger
---
Reckoning is legit in PvP. Ret is wheelchair mode in PvE and PvP.
---
Nightfall, yes, they can or just a warrior offtank or 2h fury. 
---
I'll be hording all my mats and any I can afford to buy until there's enough money in the economy to be able to afford the current prices on pservers (which match what I remember from vanilla).
---
It's a legitimate service to offer within the game for boosting alts, pretty lucrative late server. 
---
Very in-line with older Blizzard philosophy, like boosts in Diablo 2. 
---
Had a friend who just hit 60 on his hunter, he could chainpull endlessly with first aid breaks, and if u use immolation traps and serpent and tank a mob with the hunter you can easily take 2 or 3 mobs every now and then
---
And the amount of mobs in an area, and spe respawn rates
---
Bags are vital and making these, even smaller ones, is a great idea.
---
setting stream up now :)!
---
I really enjoyed watching Sacris - kid of Zeus 
---
Ive seen tons of videos talking about classic wow Paladins and how you will only play Holy in raids.   Am I the only person who remembers each guild having 1x ret and 1x prot pally for Sanc and Kings buffs?  I've not seen a single video that mentions people speccing for those.  I filled that role myself in many guilds.  
---
I remember going under stormwind with the glitch and showing it to people for gold haha 
---
He [mentions](https://youtu.be/2bsY688L6J0?t=287) nightfall in the video
---
Sorry, I must have missed the memo. Are Alliance players stereotyped as people who correct dumbfucks who state wrong opinions as fact?
---
Can't wait for Classic to be flooded with manchildren like you.
---
If you can find it Omas on wildhammer did a good pvp video. Showed full world pvp fights from memory duo with a warrior (hosebeast) mainly was a good watch I thought.
---
I wish I could have had such an amazing warm experience with my father. Unfortunately when I was a kid playing wow (vanila and tbc), my dad would simply call me a retard and tell me to go study instead of playing. Most often than not punishing me and taking away my pc. I had to hide my wow disks and wait for him to go to work, as it was the only time I could sit down and immerse myself in that beautiful world where I could escape all of the pressure from his side.
---
You are a very lucky man and I am truly jealous :)
---
Topping the charts has never been my focus. I do like that the lock brings more utility but the mage would be easier.
---
&gt;amount of mobs in area
---
As long as there's more than one, what kind of argument is this?
---
&gt;respawn rates
---
Well most areas have the default spawn rates. Why would you farm an area with low spawn rates anyway?
---
&gt;reset distance
---
The reset distance is the same for pretty much everything. This doesn't have much on an impact on AoE farming since you can adjust once you see one of the mobs reset.
---
&gt;gear
---
You can safely do AoE farming in greens that are 10 levels below your level.
---
Quite sure these 4 stages are suggestions open to change
---
One of the best I had the pleasure to play against https://youtu.be/y_-u0B4vLJg
---
trollspecc
---
Any1 that has seen zalgradis knows that retpaladins are op as fuck
---
Those are hardly efficient ways to get to rank 14 LOL
---
Yea but World PvP is about the sense of danger and some spontaneous fights that break out around the World of WARcraft, not AFK grinding in a premade 12 hours a day for Rank 14. Although if that's your jam, go for it
---
This is the way to go
---
I cant make any sense of this!!! I need Ja Rule to explain it to me. were is JA!
---
If my memory is good it was introduced with naxxramas invasion event to block mage from farming the reputation like hell.
---
This event was before naxx opening no?
---
Yeah they did. The original concept of memes were invented in 1976 by Sir Richard Dawkins. Internet memes were coined as a concept in 1993 by Mike Godwin. Same guy that's known for Godwin's law.
---
Get off my lawn before my hip breaks.
---
Chain-pulling endlessly is actually less efficient than drinking while your pet DPSes something, then using your abilities to the max and pulling a second mob once your pet has good aggro and the first mob is alive.  Mend pet works out better than firstaid because the pet is still attacking something while it's being healed.  Also, you don't need auto-growal if you're taking drinking breaks while it builds aggro, which increases over all Pet DPS.
---
You gonna start selling gold bars for warlocks since they need a gold bar for there class quest, but my advice is to sell them one by one and not a stack of 20 
---
Ret is good in WPvP and Duels, you just need good gear like Avenger and engineering/potions to close gaps/speedboost
---
Yes, nightfall is the easiest way to justify your raid spot as a paladin.
---
It's usually just easier to give nightfalls to offtanks though.
---
Aoe grinding could be faster than questing at release simply because quest mobs will be super contested, other than that I don't think its the way to go
---
No offense but I trust patch notes even more.
---
I mostly grind breasts, so i don't have enough cloth for first aid. 
---
Traps isn't efficient i think, you need to peel mob on it and its decrease yours dps, i tried. 
---
About drink: i just trying to regen mana while killing mobs, 5 second rule, because water costs alot and you need to constantly buy it. 
---
yeah but WOW shouldn't be a casino or super lotto game, the magic was hunting bosses that drops a particular item, overcoming the boss getting the item and moving onto the the next challenge. The current model keep you grinding same shit. In vanilla WOW there was a good amount of time between drops and abandoning the content altogether.
---
This is what made Vanilla WOW awesome for me. One doesn't need to do same content over and over. Now the leaving a content depends upon the mercy of content drops. In vanilla if you got the drop, that is it you feel empowered and you are done with it.
---
Because enh offer nothing that a resto cant offer...
---
I think it's overrated as well. 
---
Rolled PvP back in the day. What I expected going into contested territory was epic world battles, actual back and forth. What I got most of the time was getting oneshot by an enemy 60 every time I wanted to resurrect, forcing me to log off and do something else on an evening I had planned to play WoW and get something done with my character. 
---
Some people may like it, but I think it's just lost time. Griefers stopping you from even playing the game is not some immersive "sense of danger" imho. On the contrary, it takes you out of the world because you know the only reason you can't play has nothing to do with the game world, it's just someone behind his screen thinking it's fun to not let you play.
---
There was this huge battle of mid 40s outside Gadgetzan once, that was fun I guess. In the end not worth it imho, but to each their own. I'm preferring Normal realms. 
---
Isn’t that what a shockadin is...?
---
Check out Sakris on youtube. He actually uses the standard ret spec and not reckoning
---
I played a pally throughout vanilla and even in a guild of friends with MC on farm if I wasn’t holy spec I have a raid slot. I didn’t see a ret pally raid until wrath came out 
---
That sounds kind of fun. I would watch that stream. 
---
Isnt there the 2 hander which given all melees the same enchantment or something
---
Why do you even need rank 14? PvE gear is better for most classes. 
---
I am lusting for a RP PvP server. 
---
"AoE farming is faster than everything else because there's no damage cap to AoE spells." 
---
my argument was that its not faster to aoe 2 mobs than it is to kill them one by one... But if its 10 mobs then its faster to aoe. And if you aoe down an area then you have to wait for respawn before you go again
---
*rite
---
Man. You really shouldn't read about the 30 Years War. 
---
T2 legs from Rag actually.
---
Got recruited into my first guild in full blues / greens. Did ZG then MC. Legs dropped and one of the locks that had HWL passed on them despite the officers encouraging him to spend at least 1 DKP so the new guy (me) didn't get the swag on his first day.
---
Dragon’s Call on my warrior. I was tanking ST and hoping the shield would drop from the last boss. Was blown away when I saw the sword and was the only melee in the group, so I got it. Didn’t realize it was a relatively rare drop. Such a fun weapon, especially when the Whelpling would spawn on hit. 
---
Epics meant nothing past WOTLK. I felt so cool have a purple on my character screen. Especially a BoP that not many people had. 
---
Sometimes I forget this sub has a lot of people in denial about the higher end of retail WoW PvE where encounters have actual mechanics now. Excuse me for trying to have an actual conversation about the reality of a system in retail rather than just "new bad, classic good." 
---
Streamers shouldn't get special treatment but most of them do. 
---
Esfand, Tips, Staysafe, etc. were gifted Blizzcon Ticks, for example.
---
I've done some testing on private servers with aoe grinding and i have to say i wasn't all too impressed. I tried the spot near the Hillsbrad Farm at 22 and it seemed really inconsistent, with Nova's resisting and your mana is really low so if you stuff up 1 blizzard placement you will likely die. It was much more consistent at around 24-25, but at this level you are already intermittently finding green lvl mobs which give less exp. Maybe with more practice this would be efficient at lower levels.
---
Realistically though, I don't see this working if you are playing at launch. Sure if you are hitting up the game a few months after launch and the early zones are dead then aoe grinding may be the bees knees. But when you are competing with hundreds of other players (especially on a PvP server), I  honestly think it will be faster to use the single target build.
---
After my testing I believe I will be using the single target build up until around 38-40 and then perhaps switching to the aoe build to push the final levels. I'll also be trying to do the dire maul farming strategies around 52 so I can make some gold while leveling to 60.
---
DRM and and a shitty, buggy, slow client for example. 
---
Goatse was a meme way before 2004 
---
Hello!
---
I saw https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bsY688L6J0
---
And wonder how a seal of Righteousness specc looks like, I know nothing about paladins.
---
We had the issue of not getting enough paladins to our raids at private servers, making us missing some paladin buffs. Making it perhaps a good solution to have a hybrid, that is willing to respecc or can manage a healing position with the gear and spec they already have. 
---
I know very little about paladins and played horde in vanilla. The few months i spent as alliance on private servers was not enough to learn very much about paladins
---
current wow is just as dark as classic was.
---
Two gathering professions isn't going to get you shit for money for a very long time aside from rare materials.
---
:thinking:
---
It used to in wotlk afaik
---
Youre using the wrong spec then probably if resists are an issue at 22 go 3/3precision 2/5 frostbolt 3/3 permafrost 2/2 imp nova 2/3 imp blizzard and 1/1 cold snap. If they resist use cold snap and nova again. They should only have 1% chance to resist at that point
---
And you should! I’ll check why my memory messes with me
---
I want something that is very fun to level. Leveling has always been my favourite part of the game since I started in Cata. Looking into classic it seems like most classes are very simple to play when leveling as they only use one spell / auto attack. Any suggestions for what the most fun leveling experience is? I’m also interested in what professions would work well with these classes as professions seem like a really fun part of classic wow.
---
ENHANCEMENT. Jesus Christ. 
---
PVP is plate oriented,you can mix gear(for resistance/+heal/Hp) (im talking healer because any other spec is not competitive). 
---
Pal is no scuffed priest pve wtf you can top hps as a pal on most fights. And tier 2 afk ironforge is absolute glorious. 
---
There is a bis list for each tiers/patch and if you dont have them, you will have the next best one equiped. No tier piece before AQ/NAxx if i remember.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzpndHtdl9A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzpndHtdl9A)
---
lmao. I remember I was still in the level 1 zone and I picked up mining, and I was like "wait...what?"
---
YOu will have to talk with other pal in raid, the best setup will be with one greater might/wisdom &amp; on with greater king. Sanc is a bit useless.
---
I'm pretty sure that neither of them worked in retail vanilla. You definitely couldn't reset an instance while you were still inside it and logging out and back in just put you at the spot where you logged out.
---
If you have proof to the contrary, I'd be interested in seeing it.
---
Zalgradis 1, 2 and 3 were all excellent. I used tips from him all the way through Wrath
---
Ret paladins can be quite OP in PvP in classic. Quite OP.
---
They held a panel at Blizzcon and were given media passes, they didn't just give them tickets for the sake of it - It was for marketing.
---
Unpopular opinion: Horde being outnumbered on the server helps their faction fantasy of being the underdog that is overlooked but is very strong. 
---
Is there some drama around him that I missed or something? He seems to be hated every thread I see him mentioned. I watched some of his videos and they seemed fine.
---
This has been theorycrafted into oblivion
---
"If it's not worth it to you that's fine but obviously it is to the majority of people and to be honest I expected more than that."
---
It is always interesting to know how you came to this conclusion. I really wonder if this is truely the case that the majority thinks this is a suitable price. But for argument sake, let's assume that indeed the majority of the people interested in classic WoW considers 15$ to be a fair price. Then still, it is not like politics where majority decides. Consider the fact that people like dookleeto and me think that 15$ p/m is too much. Even if the majority thinks the price is good, we wont play. Eventually that could cause harm to the player base. Everyone knows that you can't play blizzard alone, not even with 100 players or just 1000 players across the globe. You need a solid player base for the game to give the satisfaction everyone is looking for. In addition, some of that majority will also play retail next to it which puts even further pressure on the realm population. Therefore, I wonder, if they would stick to the current plan, if classic WoW will survive the current game competition especially with the rise of more freemium games.
---
Personally, assuming there will be no 'new' development to classic beyond the last original content, I don't think it is worth to pay 15$. I think a fair price would be the price of maintaining the servers plus some profit margin for them. Considering this, I think a fair price would be roughly 5$ p/m for classic seperately while for retail players it is included into their subscription. In that case, for the classic only players they easily got their maintenance up to level, make a decent amount of profit (in guess in relative terms even higher than on retail I reckon). However, if they would do this, they will compete with their retail version and it is questionable what the effects will be in terms of their total revenue and/or profit and the life expectency of retail wow as people might switch from retail to the cheaper classic version. Especially because I think it is really hard to play both retail and classic at the same time. I once played both versions on one day and it was terrible as you are used to all the "quality of life" perks in retail. That said, I cannot make true reasoning of what is going to happen whenever they make a seperate subscription for classic WoW.
---
ps: Why are so many people giving an argumentation about being able to afford the game, seriously. All dookleeto is wondering what price you think is fair. That has literaly nothing to do with being able to afford in the setting as presented by dookleeto here.
---
This guy hunters. I've leveled a few hunters to 60 now, and this is 100% correct.
---
Mage 
---
Warlock 
---
SL Warlock
---
I have no clue what you're referring to. Enhancement has some value to a raid, they'll have Improved Weapons Totem for more powerful WF totem. Enhancing Totems is nice as well, but this is pretty easy for a standard resto shaman to get anyway.
---
Unfortunately, improved WF totem is just not worth their own meagre DPS. Stormstrike also conflicts with the debuff slots which makes their DPS even more lacklustre. They're okay Nightfall users, but if you really want the best uptime on Nightfall you can actually just use a Wingclip spamming Hunter for a higher uptime, which results in higher DPS for the raid combined.
---
You'll see some guilds use Enhancement Shamans undoubtedly, but there's not any productive reason to do so. It's just that you'll manage even with one in the raid.
---
He was probably one of the most interesting Paladins on the scene! Deserves all the praise he can get really. 
---
Early on, BM hunter no questions asked, your pet can literally solo some classes pre-raid as the game progresses though you need some modicum of skill with most classes until you outgear people. Then that opens up several options POM pyro mages are a popular one, allowing you to basically delete any target of your choosing once every 3 mins. Elemental shaman are another with insane spell coeffecients and an absurd amount of built in crit to the class. Lets you easily 2-3 shot people without cooldowns. Warriors with a healer of course take the cake at late gear, if you have somebody dispelling you and make a few macros to play the game for you while stance switching you can faceroll 2 or 3 people at a time if you are overgeared.

tfw eggs

Mace Rogues. More stuns....
---
Take me back to 2005
---
He is just very vocal about his opinions and the people on this sub cant handle it apperantly.
---
Listing elemental and pom pyro in the same breath is heresy of the highest order. To me at least. :p
---
I think Esoterious, Paladins can DPS 3, showcases full fights 
---
That one was funny :D
---
that's the build I was using, but some of the mobs are higher level than you which gives you % to miss.
---
Athens did mob tagging dungeons for 80, then the mobs on the beach in twilight highlands for 85. (Not certain if the latter was Athene though), iirc it took 6 hours to do 80-85.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMIcMevvopI     just saying they have insane damage with very little skill involved at high gear levels
---
You won't be getting a stack of gold bars going regular mining. Silver, Gold and Truesilver were actually rare in retail vanilla.
---
Lmao
---
You can be braindead and still melt faces as a shadow priest in pvp.
---
Nah, I'm a minimalist. But looks cool
---
Private servers =/= actual vanilla.
---
Clearcast proced when you completed the cast of a damaging spell. For Arcane Missiles, the chance to proc it was immediately at the start of the spell.
---
Unpopular opinion. I would still absolutely play. I want vanilla and I want it on a blizzard server. 
---
The fear of days worth of /played time evaporating is pretty bad.
---
No because its hard for me to support their recent corporate decisions
---
Doesn’t really matter but most 19 twink rouges were gnome. In my twink guild and we were pretty competitive. 
---
To be honest, yes... kind of. I don't exactly remember his name, but I know a ton of people who have beaten a level 25 druid as a level 17 hunter.
---
With All the shit Activision Blizzard is doing lately i've lost any interest playing Classic. They used to use Money to make great games, now they use games to make great Money. Thanks for the good games but it's time to move on
---
Albinoblacksheep weeps at your ignorance
---
Long video and im at work can I get a TLDR
---
Drakova was awesome but he deletted the channel :(
---
I don't know a ton about retail but I know classic well enough to say it might be a shock to you even though you played TBC. Gearing is significantly slower, the 40 person raid/larger guild management can be a lot harder to deal with logistically, socially and trust-wise. Server politics can matter, and world bosses might be a curve ball.
---
The carrot on a stick is totally different and you seem to enjoy retail's version of the carrot. The biggest difference is that in Classic the carrot is the feeling you get when overcoming hardships and the achievements aren't visual that often, they're in your memories. Small scale it's "We managed to somehow kill that final boss in a 5 man before the respawns started showing up, which could've stopped our group in it's tracks. My heart was beating fast the whole time and even if our items didn't drop, it feels like we really did something tonight." Large scale can be all kinds of things and can get really huge but it all still lives in the memory, if you forget it it's gone. No mounts or "achievements" to remind you what you've accomplished or how you accomplished it, maybe some gear but maybe not.
---
Good luck with your decision. Remember you can always wait for the first or second round of fresh Vanilla servers before committing. Always an option to just bum around halfheartedly around launch while making up your mind. (Might get some more guild converts that way too, I'm sure they'll try it out on their own at some point and might have a change of heart before the first fresh servers launch.)

It was leeroy Jenkins.

Shadow meld is nice for restealths

You need to define what does viable mean before diving into the subject. 
---
Shouldn't aoe things more than 1 lvl above you ideally
---
When playing the WoW Classic demo, I rolled one of every class. I was expecting my least favorite to be Warrior, but it was okay really.
---
Least favorite class was actually Rogue. Although Stealth is nice, I hated just about everything else about how Rogues worked. Fragile with only leather armor, almost entirely melee, didn't like Energy as a resource, and the speedy dual-wielding attacks that lack any individual impact. Plus I don't like being a thief. I guess I'm just not a Rogue person.
---
NEW FRESH
---
I doubt it they do just 4 stages of content. And arguing about loot trading being bad just makes you look like a moron.
---
It is the fastest, you can start as early as lvl 14 if you have 2-3 pieces of eagle gear.
---
By lvl 16 I was pulling 7-8 mobs lvl 13-15.
---
Yes absolutely 
---
Would be cool but they way tech is now, they don’t even technically need a cd or at least not that many. Would be cool to see a collectors edition with some cool nostalgic content, maybe with a collectible item or “sword of a thousand truths”
---
Ah ok, well that pretty much answers my question, since I'm assuming most people in your guild did not create gnomes for looks. Unless the aesthetic of an mob of angry midgets was the ideal :D
---
Escape Artist is just that good I guess.
---
Repeating, of course
---
And good aoe  spots won't be?
---
You can't shadowmeld in combat in vanilla.
---
take a break from retail, vanilla will be over in 2-3 months, then you can go back in the next big patch. 
---
Getting the 'high gear' is the hard part tho. Caster dps gear doesnt really get throw at elemental Shamans. You will properly have to roll on it as 'off specc' since most Shamans will be healing in raids. Dont expect to have the same amout of gear as a mage during the first year :D
---
Where’s hogger?
---
Literally any caster blows people up with 1 button if they get to free cast with CDs / berserking up lol.
---
Still sacrilege to even remotely compare the two :p
---
Loot trading will be bad for classic, arguing that point doesn't make you a moron.
---
I would buy a digital collector's, I want the in-game goodies, not the rest.
---
:DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
---
Possibly just because I like having physical collector stuff
---
Yet here you are
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=19169
---
Nightfall is the item they are referring to
---
I hope they don't, it devalues the original CE, which is the whole point of a CE, it's collectible and only available for a limited time.
---
I'd maybe purchase a "classic" collectors edition, depends what's included.
---
Hells yeah.
---
&gt;It was for marketing.
---
Well duh, they wouldn't get special treatment because Blizzard thinks they're cool.
---
In a heartbeat.
---
Awesome! As long as I can't buy gold from other players using real money through the token I'm happy. 
---
Already have the first one.... so don’t think so
---
If you’re legitimately asking this then just play classic because you’re going nowhere IRL
---
I get that, but that isn't what OP asked.
---
Absolutely. 
---
They absolutely under no circumstances should re-release the CE as it's a slap in the face of the people who got it originally, (of which I am not one, was about 14 when it came out). If they do a CE it should be new updated for 'classic', (behind the scenes of re-creating the magic, etc.), different and unique pets, etc. I'd buy that in a heartbeat
---
Nope, I tend to avoid useless tat, irl or in-game.
---
We have no evidence to prove that the sit macro won't work. It's literally just /sit, and mobs cirt when you're sitting down. There's no magic formula, just simple gameplay mechanics.
---
And give Activision more money than the minimum required to play their game? No thanks...
---
Oh give it a rest. Enjoy your private servers were the GM sell gold, sell items, sell rank 14 characters, unknown armor/resistance boss values, cross faction collusion. 20 different languages and regions all playing on the same server etc.
---
You know your gonna play. Your posting on the 50k classic wow subreddit. 
---
I actually really like your keybindings and am replying to this comment to save it.
---
1000% yes.

Pre 1.9 you would have a few ret paladins for k
---
It rains in Daz'aralor (city not the raid) pretty often for me. But it always seems to only last a couple of minutes or it seems to stop when I phase onto the mission table boat or something. 
---
The effects still work, theres just something not quite right about the current implementation. 
---
You are holding so tight to your argument about its "rarity" and I just can't see how its relevant to the system having massive disadvantages. You're insulting my intelligence if you think you can convince me (or anyone) by repeating the same thing over and over.   
---
And let's just not go into the talk about how Titanforging limits design space for gear or how it promotes unhealthy gameplay by pushing people to repeat trivial content over and over just to "pull the lever" once more. 
---
Jotaro :Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes 
---
Ambush kill solo player &gt; Horde team running toward you &gt; Shadow meld until you can stealth again
---
I think it also passively makes your stealth slightly better.

Work as an IT manager.  Even if your on the guest network, it is monitored and easily reported against.   Even with a non-company device connected to a guest network they could find where it is in the building using the wireless heat map of the access point your connected to.  Or if they didn’t want to walk around simply blacklist the laptop.

To truly be safe you need to use your phones hotspot.

Anyone know what was on the behind the scenes DVD? Would love to check it out

That map is pretty damn tempting...

But the rest of it unnecessary.

Yes

Where is the title exactly a quote of? Has someone said that?
---
what would the talents for a spell power ret paladin look like? (the last one he described) 
---
Its exactly what he asked for 'When I say braindead, I mean tailored for an absolute retard who has no basic comprehension of gaming whatsoever'
---
Like what? A platform to further increase the amount of games in said library?
---
Learn which re agents to farm when leveling. There are certain mobs that drop items used in later patch releases that if you plan for will make you a TON of cash.
---
Anyone that's worked the AH before on a private server knows what I'm talking about. Beginning of a server supply will be extremely high with demand close to zero. Farm and grind as much as humanly possible to sell vendor trash. You want to keep a lookout for people who dont know to hold onto rare items and instead post them immediately in the first few weeks. You can get items for 1/4 of their true value.
---
With the influx of new or old players there are going to be many opportunities to make gold. Just have to know where to farm and when to sell or buy
---
“if” when they 
---
I can’t even use the cd to install lol
---
Make it the wow classic edition id be down
---
Have tried it..It's awful  
---
BT doesnt do any damage since your attack power is garbage when leveling.  
---
Getting a decent 2hander with MS is the way to go(Good old whirlwind axe.)
---
I played a shockadin back in vanilla. Dabbled in try. 
---
I think the best class for a rogue is probably going to be a rogue.  
---
Let me know if you end up going that route though because I'm thinking about my twink rogue as well.  
---
I think this is it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYxU7pIJHhk
---
Yes, but I don't think they should.
---
I'm all for them creating a new "Classic" collectors edition though, with the in-game pets and maybe some classic-themed items like a behind the scenes like they used to do.
---
Don't forget about the 15 skill added to engineering. I think that might give you access to greater engineering items. Could be wrong though!  
---
Paladins hard counter is priest. Any spec vs any spec. Get mana burned down, you dont have burst to kill him before he can heal. Once you have 0 mana the priest can just wittle you down.
---
Best matchup is probably Rogue. Depending on spec, you either outheal or outdps them.
---
For holy and hybrid paladins, good matches are druid and rogue. Neutral are warriors, shaman hunter and mage. Warlocks tend to be a bad matchup and priests impossible unless theyre really bad.
---
For reck/ret paladins; Warriors, druids and rogues are easy. Hunters and mages are neutral. Shaman become a bad matchup. Warlocks arent as hard and priests are equally impossible.
---
It does. Increases the effective stealth level of stealth and prowl by 1.  
---
I'd be tempted, but no. 
---
T1 &amp; t2 rogue gear is killer
---
It's a recording of a ventrillo raid chat.  They have a kid in as a substitute who feels a need to prove how much he likes women/has experience with them.  One of the highlights is when he tells the person he's talking to "I think these guys are virgins" with dead seriousness.
---
I can’t seem to get into any games recently. Just painfully waiting for classic. 
---
Probably not, I have 3 unopened ones that I purchased on release. New version would just devalue the originals.
---
In raids, theyre more or less the same as the other heal classes, youre pretty much just spamming. While your heals are faster, i never considered that more "fun".
---
5mansare more challenging as you have no flexibility, you just have to power through it with raw healing. It depends what you like. Priests have more choices and are easier, while paladins have less choice but are more difficult.
---
I see this a lot. I don't know what you mean by shockadin. Do you mean a holy healing paladin who specs into holy shock, or are you thinking of it in the way it was in BC and WotLK where it was more of a holy battle tank that used holy shock to deal damage?
---
The fact is, shockadins weren't really a thing in classic. In BC shockadins became a thing because you could spec into Sanctity Aura AND Holy Shock. Not only that, in BC Holy Shock was on a 15 second cooldown, not the massive 30 second cooldown you have in classic.
---
Most paladins in classic skipped holy shock because it really wasn't that worth it. Having that 30 second cooldown really was a huge boon to the spell that the developers realized later, which is why in BC it had the 15 second cooldown. 
---
Your build will be 30/0/21 or 31/0/20 if you are a going for a more healing/damage build. Not having sanc aura gimps your damage quite a bit. 10% bonus holy damage is nothing to scoff at. But, you can't take both Sanc aura AND holy shock. So you have to decide what is more important, 10% damage increase to you 8 second judgements (if you take the talent for it) or a 10% damage increase to your 30 second holy shock. Should be a no brainer.
---
Amazing, I wonder what caused that here, thanks!
---
Lmao ret was good in PvP
---
Warrior with top end gear and a good healer with good great was one of the most unstoppable things in vanilla. Without either of those, not so much. You could still get lucky and mess people up with no healer, but not the same way.
---
Yes there will 100% be mob tanking and dungeon boosting in classic. Get a 60 gain at least 2 levels in one run depending where you’re at. Can tag the whole instance if ya wanted.
---
This. In a heart beat.
---
I agree on this one. Rogue seems like a good class option if you want to play rogue. 
---
Maybe, depends on the price
---
Never played on a private server but since you know so much about it maybe you are the one playing it. I started playing wow in tbc and was really interested in Classic that's why im here but i can't ignore the facts if you are ok supporting a scammy Company good for you whales 
---
Agreed.
---
Yes, that would be instant "buy" cast from me.
---
I feel you my friend
---
Me too. It would still be the best MMO for me. 
---
Probably not worth it in an opportunity-cost sense. Better to just get the money quick, than to waste time selling on the AH for a measly 10%.
---
Could pop on a vanilla p server and get some exp for vanilla.
---
I haven’t been able to figure out how to do that. Any suggestions? 
---
Bullshit unless mobs were 7 lvls lower lol
---
It wouldn't devalue the original. In my view it makes the original more valuable. The originals are clearly originals and will be dated obviously as such. 
---
Absolutely not. 
---
nope
---
Have you ever watched loony tunes? Foghorn leghorn?
---
Cause this entire thread just flew clear over your head.
---
That cloth map just brought back so many memories. 
---
That used to hang by two thumb tacks on the wall above my computer during vanilla. Ahh good times. 
---
Do you happen to have a mirror to look in? You're repeating the same thing over and over as well. I already explained to you that NOBODY is running trivial content over and over for a chance at titanforged gear. Nobody that actually plays retail WoW would do that because the chance of it happening is so rare that it's not something you can reliably farm for. Try to dismiss it all you want but the rarity of it is a pretty important thing. If titanforging was reliable you'd have a point, you would then have a valid option of farming lesser content and fishing for an upgrade, but it's not so you don't. 
---
If you raid Mythic for example, you can knock out heroic in an hour or so each week and maybe get an upgrade or sidegrade every couple weeks or so. Running anything below that isn't worth your time. As the devs said in one of the last legion Q&amp;As, in a normal length tier one piece of normal gear will titanforge highly. There's no guarantee it's going to be a useful piece either. So even running normal isn't worth your time, and running anything below that is even less worth your time. I assure you nobody is getting their gambling kicks by running low content for an upgrade that they're never going to get. You've very likely got better odds on getting a rare mount drop. 
---
You can look at the armory profiles of the very top of the very top, people who engage in any activity they can to get upgrades to get every advantage that they can and they generally only run normal once. Ever. It's very much not worth it. So with that in mind, if you play retail and you've been running normal and below fishing for TF upgrades you've been wasting your time. 
---
So yes, the rarity of the system is important. That's what makes trivial content not worth doing just for titanforging, that's what makes it have zero impact on the high end when someone on the low end hits the lottery and gets an upgrade, that's what makes it a pretty sweet bonus when it happens instead of something that you should try to farm for. 
---
Arguing with you is like going back in time to two years ago when people didn't understand how the system worked to be honest. 
---
Gnome is probably best since most of the 19 brackets cc's are slows and roots. Human second since sword spec increases your hit slightly if I'm correct. 
---
Yep, but I agree with others. Make it a classic edition not the exact old one. Definitely want behind the scenes recreating.
---
Waddaya mean? I've always played Enchantment Shaman.. /s
---
I play a lot of DotA and Witcher 3 
---
Also fuck around on my personal private server testing stuff
---
I got the original collector's edition and TBH I was pretty disappointed in it and haven't purchased a collector's edition of anything since. The pets were cool. I liked the soundtrack the most but wasn't impressed with/barely remember anything else in it. I remember the 'cloth map' pictured above being advertised as a 'wall scroll' which I thought would be cool. When I actually opened it, it was a cheaply made, 8.5x11 piece of paper. Eh, whatever.
---
Lineage 2 Classic from NCSoft, but it feel really really oldschool but it pass
---
Who will not ?! 
---
Crunching numbers already?
---
I bought that box!  And it was worth every penny.   The "making of" DVD alone was worth it.   And the art book is just gorgeous.
---
Something was lost by moving to digital downloads. 
---
Everything will be cheap and everyone will be poor. You really need those high-level trash item grinds to kick money into the economy, and before level 40, everyone with half a brain is gonna spend their money primarily on skill training and mounts. I think the smartest move, is to get to 80g so your mount is secure, and then spend your remaining g on items/mats that will become valuable when people start hitting 60. Be on the lookout for exotic pets, Twink BIS, pre-raid BIS and rare recipes.
---
Should not be a very hard task to figure it out by yourself with https://classicdb.ch/ or similar resources with the help of filters, assuming you have very basic knowledge about the classes (like AGI being a good stat you should aim for as rogue) and adjusting it to your glass cannon/tanky/balanced playstyle. 
---
~~Can we stop the BIS list autism, please?~~
---
It may not be exactly as fast, but even at 60, you are going to need to spend time farming gold. 
---
Its worth it to aoe as much as you can just for that fact.
---
Shut up and take my money 
---
Gnome also gets 165 engineering which allows for mortar: [https://classicdb.ch/?item=4403](https://classicdb.ch/?item=4403)
---
Its one of the very, very few stuns available to lvl 19s.
---
Rend isn't actually horrible damage while leveling I charge demo on the way in Then rend. Swap to zerker, and continue on from there. My buddy and I did it on a ps and its very effective we were able to grind like 7-10 mobs before having to heal
---
Hear hear!
---
Youre not. Bronze mortar is 165 and  2second stun plus some pretty decent damage on that level.
---
Yes, that's how gambling works, my point is drops are not like purchases where you pay and expect something in return.
---
Many items from bosses are classed as not worth getting, thunderstrike for example - we both kill sulfuron in MC, I get T1 shoulders and you get vendorstrike? How is that fair?
---
You can't pay for specific drops, the analogy is nonsensical. Titanforging is shit, but it's just another layer of gambling on gambling - one that shouldn't be in the game - but if I get a drop and you get the same titanforged I don't think I was unlucky, because I was luck enough to get the item - I just think you are luckier because you got + ilevels.
---
If we both enter a raffle, we do t expect to win, but if I win a box of chocolates and you win a magnum of champagne it not unfair, it's just shit that there is such a massive disparity between prizes. 
---
If we BUY the same item, then you get a better item, then that's unfair.   
---
Exactly there are plenty of 1 handers leveling especially as horde that are good.
---
The actions of some people at the top making decisions does not mean it's a scummy company. If you go through life trying to avoid every company or product that don't have their hands 100% clean you'll be missing out on a lot of fun. That's just my opinion.
---
That's your opinion a missed attack with a 3.5 speed weapon feels way worse than a miss on a 2.7
---
I just want to use my panda
---
I don't think they should re-release the same thing.  The original would be de-valued if they did that.  Instead, I hope they make a "Classic" collectors edition, who knows what it would include, but I'd almost definitely buy it.  
---
Additionally, those of us that have the original collectors edition should still be able to summon our series of pets (Diablo, zergling, and panda bear).  
---
You don't really need to hamstring kite. You actually kill slower in this build doing it. Hamstring kiting is so good for 2 hander because of weapon speed with this you would be missing out on a lot of dps because of lost time. Thats why you take blood craze so when you get crit you heal. And imp. Demo allows you to keep the mobs AP lower so they arent hitting you very hard at all. Then grinding. At level or lower level mobs is super helpful.
---
"... as \[Blizzard\] owned the IP rights to anything created using their service"
---
That sucks...
---
This is the correct answer here. I have the original collector's edition and I love it and still have all the items. I want the "classic" collector's edition if it were a thing, but sure as heck don't want the same thing again. Just do not release the same thing, it needs to be a new "Classic" collectors edition that shows the process of how the game was reworked to go retro and the development they went through. 
---
The in-game pets should be brought back as well and perhaps be a new set, however I like your idea that if the original collector's edition is still bound to your account that you get the old pets too! Maybe it ends up being one or the other. Otherwise the art/manual/map/behind-the-scenes need to be replaced/updated.
---
 Try it , mages are op as fuck haha. 
---
Just google vanilla wow private server, they have links for 1.12 clients on their websites
---
Little bit of Slay the Spire. Literally nothing else even holds my interest for more than 5 minutes.
---
No, it only drains the target's mana. You might be conflating it with the BC ability [Aspect of the Viper](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Aspect_of_the_Viper) which had passive regen and returned mana with every shot.
---
On pservers, sitcrit works from everything. In vanilla it only worked from special attacks.
---
That's a pretty drastic difference and that's what people mean when they say /sitcrit didn't work on live.
---
&gt; Can we stop the BIS list autism, please?
---
My pleasure.
---
If DM North AOE farming works on a mage still at 60, you'll want to keep skinning.  
---
If you're not going to be a serious PVE/PVP'r then really who cares what you do for professions. Just do something you think sounds fun.  
---
Without hesitation!
---
I was so jealous of zzz panda owners.  Wish I had splurged.  They could make a classic pet pack where you get to pick only one and it has a collar with a C on it or something like that.  
---
A Vanilla version of ElvUI came out well after BC's release for use on private servers. There's a good something just like it will exist on official classic though! :D
---
search through the xpoff forums for 1.12
---
Faster than they could type WTS
---
They are literally doing what people have bitched and moaned for. People complained there wasn't enough content and that they didn't create enough interesting content. So what did they do? They fired people that had nothing to do with content creation or development and are hiring people to work on content creation and development. The only thing is all the news articles you probably read/listen to only say about the " They fired people" and not the "are hiring people to work on content creation and development" part and you don't look past what these people tell you to look at.
---
First thing I type when I log on for the first time is new fresh when 
---
Way back when there was a lot of things you had to do daily that wasn't just world quests to remember everything and know how to do everything my dad had at least 10 pages printed out that he used either Paint or Microsoft excel to make so that way he didn't have to keep opening the web browser to look at how to do something if he forgot. He taped all of the pages to the wall/computer desk for easy viewing. I feel like to ordinary people that probably looked very strange.
---
I know the Bloodvine set (patterns released with ZG) is BiS for warlocks until tier 2.5 gear, not sure about mages. But if those 3 pieces are BiS for mages too, you may want to consider keeping tailoring until you replace those pieces, since being a 300 tailor grants the set bonus of 2% crit.
---
The pieces are BoE, so u could always have another tailor craft them for you, but you'll lose out on the set bonus.
---
Just in case any of that info influences your decisions.
---
It’s a slap in the face!
---
In a heartbeat. I'd rather buy a Classic collector's edition though. The whole point of a CE is that it's time period exclusive.
---
Are people forgetting that Beast Mastery hunters exist? Easily the most brain dead class in the game, for pvp. 
---
Tailoring can make heaps of gold at 60 if you buy bulk runecloth and sell the runecloth bags. And they can also make tons of gold from enchanters, if you get the white bandit mask pattern. It is one of the most efficient way to farm specific enchanting materials.
---
Obviously not a resource but engineering to max level for the goggles is key
---
Same I don't even have a optical drive in my PC, haven't for years. Typically even when you buy a game on disc they give you a activation code that you have to use anyways and once you use that you can typically just download it. If you have even moderately good internet anymore its pretty much just as fast if not faster than it use to be to just download it off the internet.
---
No. You spend 70% of your time waiting on spawns.
---
I did 23-60 entirely aoe on a low pop server. You do make a lot of gold though.
---
Also you can be griefed by both factions, a same faction mage can spam sheep what you pull till you die or steal your tag while pulling. 
---
Yee
---
No, because Money.
---
Holy paladins can get blessing of sanctuary by sacrificing holy shock, which is lackluster and has a 30 second cooldown. See this [spec](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxurtoxxrt0Mu).
---
Also, even if a paladin had 0 points in holy spec and invested fully into DPS or tanking talents they would still be much more useful to the raid putting on healing gear and healing rather than tanking or DPSing. That's how bad prot and ret are in vanilla.
---
If they do this I hope they will include all the concept arts and other behind the scene stuffs, also a documentary would be nice.
---
Yes il buy it asap. Should include some rose tinted glasses 😉
---
Yeah I think thats what OP is missing here lol..
---
With a warrior you have other stuff to do, like drop combat to charge different targets, int shout or hamstring off targets for cc, position yoruself for cleaves and sweeping strikes, stance dance to break fears you see coming or macro a sword and shield to tank a rogue etc etc..
---
with a paladin its literally WALKING up to someone who you cannot slow... and white hitting. lol
---
I guess they also do a hammer of justice once every 30 seconds or so but really thats better in group play because a lot of times when the pally does it by themself they just get 2 white hits during the stun and then the opponent casually walks away
---
There is no magic secret you are missing, there is no cool style you are about to un-cover that the entire community has just somehow missed for 20 years now... 
---
I promise you the reason you dont see it is because its boring haha
---
I honestly thought this was the only way to do it. If you have classic collectors, you get the pets in wow classic.
---
What is loot trading? Sorry I haven't played retail since forever. Why are people afraid of it?
---
Hear hear
---
Thanks buddy
---
No, but the reasons that basically everyone is giving around here for loot trading being bad are pretty moronic.
---
I dont understand that question 
---
I would definitely buy it but I think it should be a Classic WoW collectors edition not a re release of the vanilla wow collectors edition
---
No lmao waste of money
---
There are no "must-have" addons.
---
Yeah I’ve been gaming since the 70’s and guess what, when I play games again they’re just the same as they always were. It’s just trolls doing their thing when you see the rose tinted glasses comments.
---
Depends on patch
---
Yup yup
---
Is anyone can share the Kalimdor version that goes with this map may the Light of Elune shine upon you.
---
What would you say is harder for a paladin to deal with: UD priest with Devouring Plague or Troll priest with Shadowguard + Blackout stun combo?
---
I do the same thing. I've leveled Shaman from 30-45 like six times since new year's because it's fun 😂
---
Same faction griefing in such a manner is bannable, though.
---
I've leveled 4 warriors since classic was announced...I think I have a problem
---
In a heartbeat. Name your price.
---
Not making something like this would be a terrible, terrible business decision.
---
Nope, it is just stuff I will lose rapidly.
---
I believe it said they are hiring people to focus on mobile development though. 
---
New vanilla WoW player, I'm torn at a crossroad of what I want to play. My intentions are to mainly complete all the PvE content and definitely dive into PvP, maybe go for double-digit ranks.  
---
\-Warrior- I've always mained this class, since WOTLK. Just been the most enjoyable and rewarding class to play in my decade of playing WoW.
---
\-Hunter- The only class I ever got to Cutting Edge with. I enjoy the fundamentals of the class and I can see myself playing it in Classic, but due to the nature of Classic hunters being extremely common and NOT in demand for raiding positions, this is probably my tipping point for not playing the class.
---
\-Mage- This is just out of leftfield for me. I've always enjoyed the concept of a mage but never actually took the leaps and strides to make the full transition of being a caster. I do think it'd be fun, but again this would be completely changing how I've always played WoW.
---
I don't really know much about Classic because I have very limited knowledge going in (watching a few classicasts and Kargoz videos). I know Warriors will be a challenge and probably also over-saturated in the servers, but I'm interested to see what other people with lead me towards. Thanks for the tips.
---
Thank you.
---
It I could get those few minutes of my life back, that would be great.
---
Yes.
---
it helps but because of the low proc chance and pally/shamans lack if instant strikes a Hunter spamming wingclip does a better job
---
Check out Sulfura's videos. Incredible flag carry/premade plays. If you want slower paced with more commentary you can try to find what's left of Drakova's videos. He made an actual pvp video at one point, I'll try to find it. But really ignore these idiots saying pally pvp is just auto attacking. They don't know anything about the game or class they're talking about.
---
o.O
---
No. 
---
I have the original collecters edition. Do i still get my zergling?
---
Absolutely!
---
Wasnt Emerald Dream PvE? Like Earthern Ring?
---
The RP-PVP in my time in the EU realm were Defias Brotherhood and Venture Co
---
Doesn't mean it won't constantly happen and ruin your farming. Plus every spot past the farm will be contested by both factions. Almost every spot involves quest mobs too so there is that as well. 
---
Questing as a mage is 100% confirmed faster than aoe farming, even with 0 competition, but if you are farming humanoids it's great gold. 
---
If you are first mage to hearthglen you are golden.
---
You will melt faces as a shadow priest in pvp.
---
You're welcome evil skellybones.
---
Rust has been eating my time 
---
I know how to aoe, I've played mage a lot before, Im just interested in what's faster 😅
---
I had Horde on Defias RP-PVP, and Alliance on Venture Co RP-PVP &lt;3
---
I just want some WoW vinyl soundtracks. I know it will never happen because of how much music there is, but I'd love a best of from each expansion. That's my dream.
---
To lvl 60?
---
Indeederooni I've been testing leveling routes and farming spots
---
Lol "You can be middle of the road in 2 subjiches if you min max the shit out of a class that's antithetical to minmaxing". Can we all just admit that there are some specs/classes that just aren't good?
---
Like many, my paladin PvP video consisted of me standing at the back healing.  :)
---
Ever heard of witcher3, original sin , dark souls (common you don't play ds for the multiplayer) , doom , .... the list goes on just like your insanity 
---
I think the most useful is Cartographer. It provides X,Y coordinates on your map, and allows you to shrink to map so you can still see your character while viewing the map. It's probably the #1 addon (or something with the same function) I'd recommend once Classic releases.
---
That's outdated (or just missing some spots)
---
I remember for sure there were flight masters in Searing Gorge and Burning Steppes.
---
Troll priest because you dispell Dev plague
---
Wow crazy how few flight paths there were compared to now
---
Only if the game would follow original vanilla standards. Classic won’t even be the same as vanilla was unfortunately since it will have loot trading, automatic report system, sharding etc.
---
no it wasn't
---
arcane missiles is dmg based since 1.9 you can even search for the patch notes 
---
Well, since they can play pretty much all day all they have to do is start by playing 24h straight to get ahead.
---
It didn’t. 
---
Your MT will suggest threat meters.
---
But we all know the only must-have addon is a damage meter.
---
Or even better, will they reprint the official Dungeon guide? I would buy that.
---
i believe this would be the optimal seal of Righteousness specc [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sgVzZVhZVfLxbcq](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sgVzZVhZVfLxbcq)
---
The parry is for situations when there are aoe packs and u might grab aggro as a paladin, and parry would increase ur dps via parry-haste.
---
This is the implementation of SoR spec [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg7t4Lwj4cg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg7t4Lwj4cg)
---
More details in the description box and all credit goes to the creator.
---
I don't spend money on collectors editions. I feel too old for that. 
---
Yeah, I noticed that down in the thread. I remember it being the case for much of vanilla.
---
I was sure I deleted that shortly after posting it...
---
Og was another top level Horde progression guild, must have been a different server. My mistake, thanks for sharing the photo though!! Good memories.
---
Mages have a lot of utility as well in the form of polymorph, intellect buff, decurses, conjured food and water, and portals to major cities. 
---
Nah
---
Watch Drakova and Esfand

No, because I'm not an idiot.
---
Alright, thanks!
---
 Do you know if holy paladins take improved blessing of might? 
---
I assume vindication works on bosses, 
---
Imagine if it was to scale. Westfall to Badlands would be like LA to NYC
---
This is cool, anyone have any idea as to where or how one would go about getting the coordinate system or basemap? I have an idea for a web based tool.
---
The Artwork gives me the shills
---
Yes, but only if the cloth map was nylon. 
---
No, because I bought one the first time around. It's one of the only ways to distinguish myself as an OG. No offense to anyone but you guys missed your shot and they should honor the sacred panda cub, mini diablo, and zergling
---
For rogues there's shadowpanther.net which shows BiS weapons and armour for twinks at every level.
---
That's from the minimap
---
Auctioning items at 10% over vendor price is a very bad idea. Every 24 hours an item is up and doesn't sell you lose the deposit fee, which is 60% of vendor price. Also the AH takes a 5% fee of your sell price.
---
I loved Nagrand PvP! Ring of Blood was always a fun quest in general, but having to contest with the other faction for it was fun also. Halaa days were so fun. Great story!
---
Can a paladin do that? I thought only dwarves can do that...
---
Arcane was a pretty different animal in TBC. It was a completely independent and wholly raid viable spec then. 
---
Not even subbing until I see how sharding and loot trading turns out. I highly doubt Activision is willing to invest in a different server infrastructure then they are using for retail, which means any kind of large gathering of people is gonna be much worse than it was back in 2004 or on any private server nowadays. Private servers will improve with the data Classic will make available, and they use servers that can handle more than 40 people in a small area.
---
In the old days the Retribution 31 points talent was Blessing of Kings, thats why you always had to get 1 ret paladin in the raid. In 1.12, the patch Classic is based on, BoK is the 11 points talent in the prot tree, so from the BoK point of view you dont need to take a ret paladin.
---
Man if they had an in depth "(re)making of classic wow" video I'd buy the collectors edition literally just for that
---
&gt; They fired people that had nothing to do with content creation or development
---
They fired multiple people from the Quality Assurance department, to the point where they only just have a raid team at this point. Playtesting is a big part of making interesting content as well.
---
Engi is useful for PvP and PvE sapper charges are a raid consum for serious guilds.
---
This is so awesome! Do you have the other half or know where to get it?
---
Gnome is crazy strong at level 19 Escape artist is amazing since you can remove the only CC some classes have to stop you.
---
Crusader Kings 2 is always a good game to pass some time away. Their last expac Holy Fury is quite good. 
---
I cannot get myself to play any games currently. There are literally no games that sound interesting to me anymore. Once Classic is released, all of my free time for games will be given 100% to Classic. I've never been more excited for a game in my life!
---
Than you dont know collecting. Any exact reprint/re release of an original item always makes the original go down at least temporarily and ive never seem a case where it makes the original go up. 
---
No, because I don’t have a disk drive anymore 
---
No serious guild wants a enh shaman in their raid.
---
Your best bet is to find a casual guild that allow all specs.
---
Eehhh depends on what the value is to you. A new collector edition won't make away the items you already have, but if the exclusivity is part of the appeal then yeah I can see a new CE devaluing the original for you.
---
And there's also the people who weren't there for the first run at all. They had zero chance at it. So why not give them a shot to get what they never could before?
---
If it will be released as a mobile game instead of pc game. 
---
The value of the originals comes from the pets and due to wow far exceeding blizzards expectations a very low supply of those pets. There’s no way a reprint wouldn’t slash the price of the originals
---
http://www.conradaskland.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/kalimdorflight.jpg
---
If they make it a real 1.12.1 experience mob tagging should be in the game yes.
---
Oops, I use raid frames too.  Forgot, hehe.
---
I would yes but I dont think they should release it. Collector edditions are one of a kind. It would be rude to the people who bought them originally.
---
Great but no instance locations
---
But I seem to recall flight paths into Un Goro and Silithus - none showing on this map?
---
No sadly not :(
---
More sharding then they claim, which they will have to do unless they upgrade servers from their modern game counterparts. Activision runs the finances, I doubt they want to spend more on servers for classic compared to modern.
---
Loot trading would also put me off, but not enough not to play the game.
---
Dev plague is a disease which priests and paladins can dispell also stoneform.
---
Fortunately I think that has a 0% chance of happening!
---
Indeed they even say they might change. If I could change things. I'd swap Dire Maul and PvP
---
Yeah it's a meme spec. If you are lucky you might get to be the nightfall boy in raids. Also don't forget to jack all the top end off piece items from everyone else. Use every pot and consume in the book known to man kind. And you are officially good to go!
---
Geared ret paladins can definitely be annoying to fight in PVP [tho](https://tho.You). There are times where you get those ridiculous string of crits all stacking together from SoC/Dark Moon card/HoJ/enchants/judgement all popping off at once.  But then there are times where you get no crits and that's like what happens most of the times. 
---
Also all it takes is one shaman to keep purging your ass into white auto attack mode until you afk out of the game. 
---
So good news for me then!! 
---
I agree! Sharding could be a huge problem. It won't feel authentic, or like one, big giant world like it used to if they choose to shard.
---
If they start seeing interesting use of game mechanics as game breaking. Potions and trinkets were a lot more game changing in classic. I hope to god they don’t try applying their retail style balance to items like nets, free action potions and proc damage scaling. 
---
That's not always true.  The last place I worked, the guest wifi was just a roadrunner cable modem that they didn't monitor at all.  Of course I know this because I know the network guys.  They didn't monitor or care about the traffic on it at all.  Some companies are more anal about it than others.  You have to find out yourself how your company monitors if you plan to use a guest network at your office.  Personal hotspot or mifi would be safest of course.  I'm pretty sure that was my first suggestion.  Just be smart and don't be on company equipment or network unless you know it's not monitored or cared about by the network guys.
---
Microtransactions
---
The official word at the moment is that they don't know.
---
But Blizzard have been clear in many other areas that they want to keep BFA and Classic as separate games with no crossover - if they let people have their collectors edition pets, do they let people have their blizzcon pets and mounts? TCG pet/mounts? It gets a bit messy. That's why I think it's unlikely you'll get your zergling pet in Classic (unless they make a Classic CE with the pet available, and you buy that).
---
My thought would be is that the original collector's edition pets were in the original classic game
---
He is negative and his overall effect on the private servers that I was on was negative also.  With great power comes great responsibility.  One can use it to make the landscape better or worse.  IMO he makes it worse.  He still has a right to do that, but I also have a right to not like him for it.
---
I would love to see that map in a giant game pad/mouse pad form.
---
I agree 100%.
---
It's still up in the air but I'd imagine they'll treat it the same as people asking for their old raid gear or their old characters back, they're seen as different games and people may need to re-earn/re-buy items if they want them again. But we'll see what they do soon.
---
I'm honestly very afraid for microtransactions. Especially level boosts, etc.
---
Won't the streamer also have a horde (no pun intended) of helpers to *prevent* getting ganked and people kill their mobs?  If I had my own personal army it might make the journey easier or at least doable?
---
Or no?  Do the streamer's fans not like seeing the streamer do well?
---
30/8/13 Dagger rogue is absolute brain dead spec. All you do is surprise people with Ambush/ Back stab-backstab/finisher. Rinse and repeat. 
---
Priests and Warlocks can be pretty brain dead if you are the guy who will dot up everybody in your area. 
---
Pom pyro for sure. It's usually the guy who will run for the zerker buff to 2 shot people and then suck until his next cooldown.  
---
I completely agree.  PvP servers give you a sense of danger in the world.  It adds an additional layer to your gaming experience.  I very rarely instigate a fight, but I will always pick a pvp server.
---
"Normal" realms?  You were being so magnanimous right up until the end there. :) 
---
Only if the game was 100% vanilla with no changes and no sharding. But alas that won't happen.
---

Hello there fellow cultist!
---
Someone allready posted it here but the [classic warlock discord](https://discord.gg/D6TrRkq) is the place to be. We are an active community and have an channel with \#resources .
---
Aswell as I actively keep a \#changelog of all the changes I make in my spreadsheets.
---
There are aslo faq channels for pve, pvp and leveling.
---
Etc.
---
Yes, I would spend several hundred dollars on a badass one in a heartbeat.
---
No, all that other junk would gather dust or sit in a box - all I want is a download link.
---
Decursive was huge back in the day and same with threat meters. Those are definitely must have raid on add ons for Tanks and healers/dispellers. 
---
This is a well crafted response, thank you!
---
Mats for raiding like flask and pots will be bought up instantly at a cheap price off the bat by experienced guilds. There's no question about this and it's the most important aspect. 
---
I'm level 20. You can't AoE farm until AT LEAST 20-21. Improved blizzard is absolutely required.
---
You didnt pull 7-8 mobs unless they were a significantly lower level than you.
---
Here are some of my favorites
---
Kirill
---
Zalgradis
---
Timangi
---
Griffith
---
Sickn
---
Chipman
---
I had an enchanement shaman ALT in Vanilla.  I used to run with the High Warlord crew sometimes (I was a bench warmer pretty much).  I got a purple mace called Hand of Edward the Odd.  It is a random world drop from high level mobs (55+ or so).  It procs a 4 sec buff on yourself that makes your next spell instant cast. 
---
I would follow our High Warlord warrior around, drop WF totem, War Stomp/Earth Shock healers and wait for my weapon to proc.  Once it procced I would target the Warrior and cast my biggest heal.  4 seconds sounds like a long time, but it is not.  I should have made a macro but it was Vanilla and I didn't know any better.
---
I had fun with it.  I tried to use my toolkit to fit in with whatever pvp team I had.  Shamans have a huge pvp toolkit, so you have some work to do learning to use it :)  The Hand of Edward the Odd is what really did it for me.  That thing was so cool and really made playing a pvp shaman fun for me.
---
All I want is for my original collectors edition to carry over
---
The cloth map would honestly be pretty cool
---
Cross realm
---
I remember back in vanilla my father printed big ass version of this map, laminated it and put it on the wall. Was useful to see all the level ranges and flight paths.
---
Not really a deal breaker but all the multiboxing is gonna suck. Many private servers dont allow it, however  Blizzard is all for it..
---
why would somebody spend the current going price of a vanilla CE, when they could purchase the re-release for probably less than 1/10th of the price?
---
I think a distinct collectors edition for classic could be awesome, but everything in and out of game should be unique to it.
---
Yeah I will, but please make it a real one, not some 80$ in game item only collectors edition. Give us a documentary, or maybe  a nice tribute to the history of WoW with interviews, something that shows you love this game as much as we do.  I'm a huge sucker for figures, and a Sylvanas or Thrall or god help me a Cairne would have me over the moon (maybe have an alliance version with Magni or something).  Hell just release the original one as is.  It could really help out some of the ill will and fears that players have that Activision/Blizzard is gonna fuck this up somehow if we got something that didn't feel like a money grab.  I want to spend vast amounts of money on your game, but don't want to do it through a cash shop or microtransactions. 
---
 (PS not that I don't want the unobtainable pets now that I'm an adult and can afford the diablo that I wanted so bad when I was a kid)
---
And for god's sake don't put the unobtainable pets in a CASH SHOP!!!!  (this is the panda, the mini diablo, and the trading card game pets)
---
I’m sure there will be both types of people, people who are going to help the streamer and people who will sabotage them. 
---
No matter how many people are guarding the streamer it would only take 2 rogues to gank them. 
---
I personally am going to try and stay away from servers the big streamers are going to be on. 
---
Yeah multiboxing is annoying to get ganked by, etc. Seeing them back in the day as a younger person was always cool to me for some reason lol
---
I believe they have ruled that out (for now). Hopefully that doesn't change
---
There's no real point in looking at vanilla addons, since they won't be compatible with Classic, and every addon will have to be remade for it. Cartographer will probably not exist since it's been abandoned for 10 years. Mapster is pretty similar to it hough, and it's still being developed, so there's a good chance the devs will make a Classic version.
---
It still blows my mind that there are private servers with up to 10k people online on peaks running without problems solely on voluntary donations without any trace of sharding while Blizzard might have problems running servers of half the population where everyone pays $15 a month. Pretty funny when you think about it.
---
Try out Dota Auto Chess. Might not be for everybody, but I havent had so much fun in a while. If you like games like Hearthstone, this should be fun for you.
---
Yeah its another one of those examples of a small change spontaneously producing new social interactions. 
---
If picking up skinning for extra income while leveling, is it sold to a vendor or always on the AH? Sorry if it sounds stupid.
---
I was thinking about rolling Mining/Eng at 60 even if i'm not super serious about raiding, but i was concerned about making profit with these two profs at 60...
---
There were flight paths in both. In the Northern part of Un'Goro and in the center of Silithus at Cenarion Circle.
---
T1 is  pretty nice as it is what you expect of a warrior: a metal-dressed menace.  Simple and clean. 
---
T3 is spectacular but has quite a dark knight theme which isn't as fitting IMO.
---
The comments here are hilarious. The thread is literally asking if people want a Collector’s edition and the responses are:
---
“No I don’t think Blizzard should have a collector’s edition for classic wow. What I want is a Collector’s edition for classic wow.”
---
If You roll a shadow priest, faces will be melted.
---
Naxx isn't hard, people on private servers clear naxx super easily.
---
The gear far too strong compared to rank14 gear which is equally as difficult(time) to get.
---
Yea breasts are awesome. I grind them also when i get a chance.
---
It is BiS for Mages too.
---
The general consensus is to vendor Leather if you take skinning as a leveling profession.  That is the advice I hear regardless of economy of the server.  A fresh server is unique, but I still think vendoring your leather is the way to go.
---
Ore and Herbs though, I don't know since I'm more of a self-sufficient WoW player.  I don't make money off auction house, I make money by having one of every profession and not having to buy anything.  Penny saved is a penny earned type of thing.  That is my personal preference though.
---
Trispec for imp mana burn and silence. Something like this: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxzGs0bZbhxhZVMgzcd
---
Or you could go with some sort of disc build, if you feel like that would be better than grabbing silence.
---
At low levels on new servers, it's probably not worth it to try and AH, but you never know exactly how the market will develop. It's once servers are established and people funnel money from their mains that prices start to rise significantly.
---
Camping won't be a problem for most streamers. Sharding will allow you to avoid campers as long as it's in the game, and streamers are going to no-life hard enough that they will be ahead of 90% of the players. And that last 10% isn't going to waste their lead trying to streamer camp. 
---
The reason weather is difficult is most likely due to the amount of sharding. They could probably render it client side but then it feels less genuine if one person sees rain and the other sees a clear sky. Maybe once they phase out sharding when the population is in check, patch "1.1" can be weather. Conveniently, 1.1 was when weather was originally introduced.
---
&gt; scammy Company
---
they're all like this bruh
---
This would immediately turn me off of Classic if there wasn't a new way to get the pets. A major point of classic for me is that I can play the original WoW and not miss any events and other things, if 3 pets were immediately locked behind being grandfathered in or a $4k paywall, I would know the game is not for me.
---
Probably an early vanilla map?
---
Id buy it in a heart beat
---
Not correct. Only the Bloodvine pants are BiS, for chest i still prefer the Robe of the Archmage and the boots from BWL.
---
This is where I'm at.  Had Activision not immolated all of their good will this past year I would have purchased a CE version 100%.  Now my inner circle isn't sure if they will play at all.  Activision can't be trusted.  
---
I totally agree. The best thing Blizzard can do is have a Classic WoW team separately develop new content for that version of the game.
---
There undeniably needs to be class balance and itemisation changes made to the Vanilla game to make certain classes viable. 
---
WoW Classic could go a similar route to Old School RuneScape by being set in a separate timeline with no expansion releases, content designed to compliment rather than replace the existing 60 endgame, and more of a player driven direction surrounding the game's development.
---
I would. I would also put it next to my original collectors edition. 
---
I would really hope they wouldn’t release them as an exact copy/reprint but would make them they ‘classic’ version instead with distinct differences while still paying homage to the original.
---
YE PYEP YEP YEP YEP YEP!§!!!!!
---
Yeah classic wow still deserves a collectors edition just not a duplicate. 
---
Hunters viper sting anyone with mana including mages and locks. Aside from dispellers like Pally/Sham or druid (and I know pally dispell is cheap not sure about others). 
---
If you haven't played them yet - 
---
Dragon Age : Origins, The Witcher, Neverwinter Nights 1 and 2.
---
Divinty Original Sin 1 and 2 (great cooperative game, play with a friend in another city)
---
Torchlight 2 (Diablo style game, they took all the best ideas and put them into one game IMO)
---
Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim (again and again, I never get tired of Sneak/Archery from 3 miles away)
---
Angband/Moria/Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup - Moria style turned-based games.  Oldies but goodies.
---
Tales of Maj'Ayal (sp?)  Also turn-based.  I'm a turn-based fan as I think you can make the content much more challenging.
---
I also go back and play some of these games on Nightmare mode with only one character (if possible).  I've solo'd Div Original Sin 2 on Tactician Mode multiple times (if you want to solo, be an elf for the extra action point, get Chameleon Cloak and use it at the end of your first turn).  Some of the fights are very challenging.  In Dragon Age:Orgins I play most of the game solo, but I do have to bring in a full party for a couple tough dragon fights.
---
I could get behind this, would be great. Maybe help my boi prot warrior to have a chance at OW ? :D Love that swordn'Board style.
---
I really hope the majority of players are this bad in Vanilla.
---
What a different time.
---
can you link it ?
---
Polishing the character out of.vanilla mechanics.  Wonky itemization was a part of the game.
---
Meh, an USB stick with a WoW logo or something would work just as well, but that's obviously not the point of this post
---
I don't get you at all. Consider, this way you'll be able to identify classic CE owners in-game. 
---
Use classic DB or wowhead if they release the database in a workable state.  If you are looking for a simple list to follow I don't think you will get the most out of a twinked character.
---
I love twinking and this is a little weird to say but BiS is not always best in my opinion.  For example every character's lv19 BiS head is the fishing tourney hat, http://classicdb.ch/?item=19972.  This is an amazing hat, and patently unfair to have which is the whole point of twinking.  But the engineer goggles from 150 eng are pretty good, http://classicdb.ch/?item=4385.  They also take 1/20th (maybe less) the time.  Plus you get all the cool eng tricks too on your way to leveling up to get them.  A ton of guides just put down the eng goggles, or just the fishing hat, when really its both in my opinion.
---
Now to help you figure out what item you are looking for, I keep it simple.  STAMINA STAMINA STAMINA is most important.  unless you are doing a real deep dive, off the wall, I know what I'm doing build (lv 19 evasion rouges or lv 39 one swing shamans for example) and don't mind wasting a week on something that might not even be that good, focus on stamina over everything else.  Next focus on your primary stat (look up a class guide and follow the ENDGAME stat guide, not the LEVELING stat guide, which gives spirit and such way to much value).  Don't forget to pick the right spec too, a kitty druid is gonna need way different stuff then a healer (but you can hybrid! that is a ton of fun too)
---
Really what I do is when I set out to twink I go piece by piece starting with the most important thing, the weapon, and then move from helm all the way down the character sheet to trinkets.  I'll go through classicdb item by item making a list of 2 or sometimes three things to aim for.  Also exp is a real bummer too when farming dungeons for stuff, probably no /experience off no live servers.  Plus if you start with the most important item, if you go over the exp cap and level into another bracket you havent  wasted a ton of time.
---
lol also don't forget exploration exp.  I dinged 30 once when going through ashenvale to the warsong vendor and had to start all over agian twinking for 39 (not that that wasn't fun, 39 is the second best bracket in my opinon, you get all your major abilities and some of the late game dungeons are available too which is fun)
---
One of the reasons it so hard to find good resources is that twinking is SUPER complicated and figuring out what really is BiS may be impossible.  Trinkets especially.  If you can get 2 Stranglethorn Arena trinkets, you have my undying respect (I've only ever gotten 1)
---
Also BiS is gonna change if they do progression, and the battle ground vendors when released have crazy good items.  One website is probably not gonna have all that information either.
---
Please a few of the bad ideas that you see are very popular so we can debate / dispute them. 
---
Keep in mind that Nightfall can proc on both white hits and Seal of Righteousness. Effectively this doubles your proc rate.
---
Uh, there's more healing druids going to raids than locks. Locks are for summoning and SS. It's actually not easy to find druid heals. Locks a fine class too TBH, just saying they're meh on the DPS side as much as maybe druid is meh, but harder to find healers for raids.  Honestly, seems harder to get into 5 mans for prebis as druid healer than raids as druid healer. Everyone needs 5 man tanks for prebis farming, do that to get your prebis raid gear and you'll get a heal spot. Maybe even run HoTW spec and do some tanking and healing?
---
As true as that is, it just can't compete with wingclip which you can use on every single GCD
---
No progressive itemization. This invalidates probably 50-75% of your item upgrades per slot as you progress from preraid through naxx as a warrior, along with insanely trivializing content (most notably mc/bwl/aq40)
---
The dog wants the raw amazing Vanilla, and yet actiblizz feels the need to make it "ready" for the dog.

#NoChanges
---
Every leather almost always Heavy and below should be sold to a vendor. I’ve never seen on a vanilla server, heavy or below rise to a price where it’s better to sell those skins on the AH (due to AH fees). Thick+ leather should be considered on selling on the AH, but definitely check the vendor prices before hand. 
---
There are cases where heavy will be worth selling on AH, but that is assuming someone just bought a lot of them. 
---
Ugh, no.  Every collector's edition of any game I've bought has ended up taking up space and gathering dust for years.  I might've flipped through the extra material once before shelving it.  Not a single one has brought any more enjoyment for the game, but have just been extra clutter I felt obligated to drag along for a few moves and store somewhere until I finally felt justified in tossing them.
---
Factorio is great, always trying to push efficiency higher and higher
---
Sharding in newbie zones won't be game breaking.  Loot trading only allows what a GM Would have manually allowed back in the days of vanilla and the 4 stages was a pretty standard compromise for a progression based release like classic WoW.
---
All in all I am pretty stoked we are getting the OG game back and don't feel the changes will ultimately impact my experience that meaningfully.  I am more concerned about finding a fun group of players to get through the content with all over again, that will determine if I keep playing more than anything.
---
You already can! In retail!
---
Classic WoW isn't linked to retail so why should the pets carry over?
---
The "necessary" raiding ones were KTM threatmeter, Deadly Boss Mods (alerted you to boss mechanics as they happened), Raid frames (for healers mostly as this makes their job a lot easier), Decursive (hit one button and automatically cures whoever is in need, just spam it until the whole raid is clear) and a DoT timer (for my warlock).
---
Cartographer and Auctioneer were popular although I never used them.  Questie was popular although I never used it.  Swing Timers for certain melee characters.  And of course DPS meters, which I dislike.
---
At least I have chicken
---
Is this a pdf for ants? I can't read any of it.
---
Hmm, really?
---
Archmage + Ringo's + Bloodvine Legs = 117 dmg, 2% hit, 1% crit.
---
Full Bloodvine = 83 dmg, 4% hit, 2% crit.
---
So, you're trading 34 dmg for 2% hit and 1% crit.
---
I honestly don't know the exact values/weights of each stat, but I was under the impression that hit was the most valuable stat until cap by a decent margin.
---
On retail all loot is personal loot, meaning that if you get something, it dropped specifically for you and you alone. There's no rolling or debating, you just get the loot and it goes in your bags. If you don't need the loot, and the item level is lower than your current piece, you can trade it to somebody else that was with you during the encounter for up to 2 hours after you get it. 
---
The idea of how this will work in Classic is that loot trading will be a protection for when master looter messes up and accidentally gives the item to the wrong person. They will be able to trade it without GM assistance.
---
The problem is that this system can be abused heavily by friends grouping together and all rolling on items to funnel desired loot to each-other.
---
For example you might join a BRD group as a rogue and once you get there you notice that the 4 people in your party are in the same guild. You kill Emperor and HoJ drops. All 4 people in that guild roll on the item, including the healer and the casters. The mage wins and trades the loot to their warrior friend that they are all there to help. You essentially had a 1 in 5 chance of getting the item, while combined the rest of the group abused the fact you can trade loot and gave their friend a 4 in 5 chance of winning. 
---
Druid Tier 3, it’s the best designed IMO, up there with Paladin T2, but less iconic.
---
That you needed fire resistance for Molten Core.
---
Blizzard is all for it because it will require multiple accounts with multiple paid subscriptions. So while the general rule is that it isn't allowed on private servers, it is of no cost to the user to run multiple accounts.
---
What? Classic WoW will be linked to your battle.net account, so why not?
---
Dude, just enjoy when you meet classic CE veterans in game. They're vanity pets. 
---
Is it just me or do people avoid darkshore like the plague?
---
Cloth drops are wrong. For example, once you got into mobs that dropped mageweave they would just drop mageweave. Private servers give mobs below that "line" that normally drop silk a chance of dropping mageweave, then the mobs above the line a chnace to drop silk. No mobs would EVER drop silk and mageweave at the same time.
---
Things will be listed at low prices at first because there’s no money to circulate. After a week or two there will be some gold circulating from vendoring and drops, but people will still primarily be leveling and working on saving for mounts. Later once people have mounts and spare gold prices will start to inflate
---
I mean sure, might as well sell the unarmored epic mounts to only the people who have them in retail right now as well, and same with the AQ opening mount, might as well not even have the opening event since they have already done it.
---
The whole point of classic is a fresh start, if things aren't equal for everyone on the new servers, I am out before it even starts. I don't mind them getting it for free if there is a new classic collectors edition and everyone can get it, but I do mind them exclusively getting it.
---
The change that scares me the most is Blizzard/Activision "listening to the wrong player base." This is the issue that has led us to current WoW with all of the quality of life "improvements" infecting it and corrupting it. When vanilla first released, Blizzard balanced the complaints of casuals with what was best for the game and community as a whole. They didn't do hand holding but did make the game a little more accessible (20 man raids, tier 0.5, retaining PvP ranked items  without maintaining the rank, etc.) The changes were good and well balanced. But then they kept at it and turned there back on the core mechanics that made wow so great.
---
I'm afraid that when classic releases, the massive complaints that will inevitably come out will cause Blizzard/Activision to adjust it, to tweak it, and make the game more "accessible". I'm afraid they will listen to the very vocal casuals (not referring to people who have limited time to play but people who demand that they ATTAIN EVERYTHING with such limited time) and forget that their core players, the players who want the original vanilla experience, will quit enmass if this occurs. 
---
I hope I'm wrong...

The After Naxx Parade.
---
Armor isn't going to be beneficial to you in a raid. Ideally you will never take melee hit unless shit is already hit the fan.
---
Just because you have some cloth on doesn't mean you are a scuffed priest. Your kits are entirely different. Paladin has the advantage of being able to wear priest, druid, shaman, and paladin gear. You get your picking of the best possible gear while priests are limited to 1 class of armor. 
---
It doesn't mean you can't wear plate gear outside the raid either.
---
No because i already have mine from 04
---
What server/time zone are you in? I'm probably going PVE on my main, might do some PVP alts. I am going to have somewhat limited time, so I have to make the most of it. Getting ganked constantly is really going to cut into my progress...and my pride. LOL
---
No a lot of that stuff looks kinda stupid, the only thing that looks cool is the cloth map, it looks like it would make a really cool mousepad. 
---
This is the same argument for carryover from classic-retail
---
Why won't mounts earned in classic carryover? Why won't transmog? They're a linked bnet account after all, they're vanity mounts/gear
---
They're re-releasing a game here, and the CE already applies to what vanilla became
---
You can tell in this thread which people originally bought the collector's edition, and which people want to keep retail and classic seperated.
---
I think a cash shop would do it for me, if it included 60 boosts for example. If it included stuff you could get from the tradeable card game,  Collector's Edition pets, or BlizzCon (Murky/Gurky), I wouldn't care. 
---
I'm afraid of all those things as well. I hope Classic is identical to how it was back then. However I agree with you that there are going to be a lot of casuals complaining, unfortunately. Hopefully Blizzard doesn't listen to them and stays true to those who want a true Classic experience.
---
Melt faces as shadow priest you will...
---
Vendor leather until thick which will sell for 1g 20s - 1g 30s per stack on AH or you can craft nightscape tunics to vendor. 
---
Melt faces as shadow priest you will..
---
I agree, we need no changes!
---
Absolutely! Are you Horde or Alliance? PvP or PVE?
---
Hopefully Classic is identical to what it was back in the day! All we can do is hope.
---
Don't get how you can compare that. Like at all. 
---
But then again, you weren't there back then. At CE launch. So how would you know. 
---
Yeah, in my experience most people seriously undervalue stamina and intellect when twinking. For example, I've been crunching some numbers for level 49 "twinks" and found that a BM hunter needs to do their Auto Shot + Multi Shot rotation for 55 seconds before 1 point of agility contributes 10 points of damage. Or they could just get 1 stam and have about the same value no matter how short the fight is. That's an extreme example with a poorly scaling class/spec, but most classes at low levels don't scale very well and it's essentially always true that 1 stam &gt; 1 damage stat for any class.
---
I honestly think a restart of the series would be best. And the reason I don’t agree with just having it go longer is because you will have people that completed everything just sitting there doing nothing. I always hated the end of expansion cause there was nothing to do but wait
---
I totally agree with you! A cash shop is something that absolutely needs to be kept away from Classic. ESPECIALLY if it included 60 boosts/gear purchasing, etc. I'd like to think Blizzard has their head on straight enough to avoid this, however Activision could have some influence, unfortunately.
---
Also, I love your content! Keep it up Soupa! :)
---
I started playing in spring 2005 so close enough, but nice gatekeeping :^)
---
I only did a little bit of WPvP but honestly cannot give you a thorough answer on their viability. I mostly just ended up healing instead of trying to do any damage. Tons of utility, and Holy Shock really was a life saver more times than I can count.
---
I would say that if you were thinking of doing a Shockadin build at 60, it is wicked gear dependent to do any real damage, and in most cases, if you're trying to do a massive amount of damage, you'd be better off going Reck-Bombing with the classic /sit macro.
---
in fairness, paladins can do some incredibly next-level meme things when theyre devout flag carriers in wsg
---
but otherwise yeah theyre dreadfully boring even in highlights
---
I think it would be better to make classes viable like a Druid but you can’t go near what it is today. The biggest issue with today’s wow in my mind is that everything feels to flat. There aren’t rewards for pvping anymore. I liked it when you put in the time and you got better gear that made you a force to be feared. Or like when you ran an entire raid got nothing for 2 weeks but then that third week you got pieces. Everything felt rewarding vs now even when I get gear it feels very bland 
---
Level a toon  to 14 and go to western westfall. 
---
There’s camps over there that have 0 caster and are easy to aoe on.
---
By the time I was level 18 with better gear the pulls were 10 mobs lvl 13-15 gnolls.
---
The technique is pulling mobs with rank 1 fb, wand , run around em with arcane explosion. Frost nova, arcane explosion some more.
---
Without any gear a lvl 14 mage can do 4 mobs. With good gear 6/7 is possible.
---
Once level 16 flamestrike helps a ton.
---
Emergency potions/scrolls are used since they drop a lot from those.
---
I used the 4 stamina cooking buff too.
---
Just buy your gold from the Chinese like everybody else!
---
So they could ruin said server with their followers? The reason why RP servers are more chill is because of RPers, not some magic that makes them more chill. You introduce horde of dipshits who come there only because of their streamer and there you go, this chill server becomes just like every other (maybe even worse).
---
No... dammit, yes.
---
That´s literally their name.
---
Uhg, don't play a holy paladin, they wear dresses and cleanse, buff and it's boring as shit. If you want to heal and wear a dress, be a priest so at least you have an aggro dump like fade and disgustingly good healing
---
We used to wear a ton of fire resist on our entire raid for vael and kill him after our essence of the red wore off.  I know we stopped doing that at some point in vanilla but I'm not sure when.
---
The best build for lvling priest regardless of situation is 5 points in Spirit Tap and 5 points in Wand Spec. Do whatever you want after that. You got the bis talents already anyway.
---
Probably.  It's the only collector's edition I don't have. 
---
Grand marshall and a clicker, name a more iconic duo.
---
Go resto if anything if you are raiding.
---
Enhance gives you very little compared to the usefulness of resto in a raid.
---
What happens when the AQ gates open? Will they shard then? Where would the line be drawn? 
---
Loot trading is so much more game breaking than saving GM time. I've been in guilds full of dicks and cool people alike. Let me tell you that the dicks will abuse the loot trading in its fullest. They will stack the rolls against pugs every single time, and even if it isn't as rampant as we make it out to be, it will form distrust in the community. I will personally be reluctant to join a group if I see 3 or even 2 people of the same guild just because I will have the nagging voice saying "what if the item I need drops finally and this dude wants it for his offset". People say this is a complicated ordeal but it really isn't. It takes like 2 seconds to say in discord - roll for me and then the covering of your tracks is all but known how to do. Or half pugging a raid like ZG. People roll for items for guildies all the time in later expansions and just leave the pugs with no fair chance at something. I know I won't join any guild majority pug in classic, because it will open the door to distrust. 
---
The easiest solution is to just say tough shit and if you make the mistake of mislooting an item or not rolling on an item fast enough just tell people this is classic and you have to be careful. They will only make that mistake once, usually. Possibly have GMs for master looter in raid environment tickets, those will be few in between, but for dungeons and small time things? Be more careful. There will be a small uproar from people from the first time but they will learn and adapt.
---
From Lord Knightcon in the comments:
---
&gt;Let me tell you youngin's a little something about 12-year-olds in raids.
---
&gt;Back in Vanilla the guild I was in was co-lead by a husband and wife. They were good people, and not really into the whole big raiding scene, but just gathered around them a bunch of solid, reliable players to go do some of the easier content. I was one of their off-tanks (an Undead Warrior at the time).
---
&gt;One of our most frequent fixtures in the Vent server at the time was a Tauren Hunter named "Tsaot" (Toast spelled backwards). Since it was much easier to pronounce (and because the heady lady of the guild thought it was adorable) we all just called him "Toast". I didn't know too much about him personally, but a lot of people really liked him. He was very polite, real quiet, and we often had to be told to mind the topics of our conversation because we would forget he was there.
---
&gt;One day we were getting together to go do Upper Blackrock Spire (a 10-man dungeon at the time), and our hunter lead had flaked out on us again. We needed someone to kite General Drakkisath (the final dungeon boss at the time), and the only person available was Toast. Quite a few of the players were rolling their eyes in raid chat when the husband asked him if he wasn't too busy to come along. He happily agreed and we pushed through the instance.
---
&gt;We reached the general's room, and it finally occurred to the main tank to ask Toast if he had ever been here before. He said no, and you could hear the frustration in the chat. The guild leader shushed everyone up, and calmly explained to Toast what he had to do: Pull the general, allow Gargos (me) to pick up the left guard, and our main tank would grab the right. Then he had to kite the general as far away as he could without dying. The raid would get the guards down as far as they could before General Drak could kill him and then come back for us. Toast very politely said, "Ok." without asking a single question, and we got started.
---
&gt;Toast pulls and takes off running, myself and the MT grab the guards while Toast and the general disappear. After a bit of DPS, both of the guards are dead, and the whole group is standing around in awkward silence. There's no sign of the general, and we haven't heard a peep out of Toast since we began. So the guild leader goes over the Ventrilo channel.
---
&gt;GL: "Hey, Toast?"
---
&gt;Tsaot: "Hm?"
---
&gt;GL: "Are you... still alive?"
---
&gt;Tsaot: "Yep."
---
&gt;Raid: O_O
---
&gt;GL: "Where are you?
---
&gt;Tsaot: "Running in a circle in The Beast room."
---
&gt;Main Tank: "He made it that far? What the hell??"
---
&gt;GL: "Ok... well, you can come back now."
---
&gt;Tsaot: "Ok."Then he promptly Feigns Death, and follows the general back to the group and assists us in killing it.
---
&gt;Now to give some context people who aren't vanilla veterans, successfully kiting the general is not an easy thing to do. Our Hunter class lead couldn't do it very well. And it was incredibly difficult to it without dying. This kid, on his first ever visit to UBRS, successfully kited the general almost a quarter of the way across the instance, ran circles around him for several minutes, and then made it back without dying. I'd been in several PUGs with more than a couple "professional" raiders at the time that couldn't do that. The head guild lady flat out told our hunter lead that she would have replaced him with Tsaot if he wasn't 12 years old.﻿
---
I've had quite a few experiences like this in WoW over the years.  You'll be surprised to find that a lot of individuals you play with that are really good at video games might be a different age/ gender than you expect.  Don't judge a group by a single experience.
---
Have her read the class and race descriptions and have her pick a few that sound cool. Then talk to her about the pros and cons of each so she can make a solid decision. Don't think that because your wife isn't into gaming right now, that she won't pick up on it and be incredibly good. My wife never played a game in her life until WoW and she's one of the best tanks I've ever seen play 5 man content. Unfortunately, I couldn't talk her into raiding because of how toxic a lot of players are and it was a turn off mixed with being intimidated. Questing and 5 mans, absolutely had that down to a science.
---
So, try not to let your bias of what you think is good and what you think she might be good at muddy the conversation. Simply provide the information and when talking pros and cons, try to stay objective about it. It will all work out.
---
Enjoy!
---
lol, the rap verse at the end.
---
Cash shop. Real sharding. Bad right-click reporting. Death by a thousand cuts is the most likely though.
---
Yah I guess I should not have mentioned tbc - when I say thru I meant vanilla thru tbc.  If you’ve got a priest to buddy up with or box, you can spec just about anything you want.  Frost gets so much love because you just cant really go wrong with it.  But arcane is alot of fun you just might not level as fast and you’ll probably have more corpse runs if you are solo.  
---
Wrong
---
Yeah anyone who thinks they original wow collect edition should carry over to classic just wants to Epeen flex. If they plan on doing a new CE for classic it should be new.. they could use the same three pets if they choose but EVERYONE should have to purchase it. If mounts and MOGs don’t xfer, which they shouldn’t as you pointed out, why would pets xfer? 
---
Holy paladins should always take improved blessing of might if they're PVE
---
Vindication should work on bosses; however, it isn't desired because it takes up a debuff slot with very low benefits to the raid.
---
&gt; What happens when the AQ gates open? Will they shard then? Where would the line be drawn?
---
They drew the line when they said only the starter zones. Your question ignores the answer to the very question its asking in order to just.... ask it again.
---
Very frustrating.
---
Orc fury warriors due to Axe skill, blood fury, and access to windfury absolutely have the highest theoretical Raid Boss DPS, under the assumption you have a tank who can produce enough threat.
---
&gt; With All the shit Activision Blizzard is doing lately i've lost any interest playing Classic.
---
Alrighty then, bye.
---
25% of all tickets are loot related issues.  This is a HUGE number and Blizzard is aware for this game to be successful they have to offer this service.
---
Loot issues are major issues to players so I personally would rather have loot trading, than no solution at all, since the player base would evaporate due to frustration over time.
---
I came from EQ, and they never offered stuff like loot restoration... there is a reason WoW ended up with 25x larger player base. 
---
Who cares, fight it anyways dumbass
---
I proudly have it already from release day. 😁
---
What would be the best boosting class? I remember powerleveling people through dungeons all the time, just can't remember what class I did it with.
---
I seem to recall people being banned in TBC for tagging in dungeons
---
lol far from the "best gear"
---
played some of them , oblivion was the best , thanks for the suggestions .
---
That doesnt make sense and Blizzard said themselves no cross overs. Retail CE != Classic. They are two separate products. Also, it wouldn’t even be Classic since people would not have an option to purchase it like they did in classic 
---
This just in: getting R14 wasn't about skill.
---
ActiBlizzard also said classic would be as vanilla as possible. Then says loot trading and sharding will be in the game. Their "line" means nothing until I see it. 
---
Did they though? Who’s to say they won’t change their mind when the time comes? 
---
Back in the nostalrius days Humans could do more DPS due to salv and the sword specialization. Human rogues and Human warriors dominated the DPS scene.
---
Definitely didn’t have anything to do with being the most casual friendly mmorpg at the time though did it?
---
Spring 05? So... you weren't there. As I said. 
---
Spoiler alert: they won’t reply.
---
I'd only be interested in PvP and pve healing. Thinking 1 11 39
---
Yes, they did, its on fucking tape.
---
And if your response to literally everything they say is. "Yeah well theyll change their mind" then why are you here? If nothing they say can be trusted, then why bother? They said classic... maybe theyll change it to MOP. They said no transmog, but maybe theyll do that too! They said no raid finder but maybe theyll do that too!
---
Hey in fact, maybe they wont do anything at all and just cancel it! Who's to say they won't "change their mind when the time comes?"
---
A rational adult doesn't spend months on subreddit making such stupid arguments for the sake of arguing. If you don't think they are trustworthy then move on to the next game and stop shit posting.
---
Still playing EQ.  When classic is announced I’m putting in vacation and canceling EQ subs a second time for WoW
---
Prot pally would work well for healing and BOP on the carry then aoe the packs down.
---
You will learn very quickly to appreciate the fact that Horde have RFC, WC, SFK, SM Graveyard, SM Lib, SM Armory, SM Cath, RFK, RFD -  all in Horde Territory.  You will cry tears of agony as your alliance 5 man groups disintegrate slowly over 30-60 minutes trying to get to an instance on a PvP server.
---
You will also very quickly learn to appreciate how long you can milk leveling in the barrens without seeing any PvP until 1,000 needles, which alliance your own level will scarcely enter, and not really have to worry about STVietnam...which is completely avoidable or doable in small chunks in areas near your camp by avoid the zone and Gankistan.
---
Much easier leveling process Horde side. 
---
I don't think the drop rates should be terrible. I think any content that gives better loot than Naxx should just be significantly harder than Naxx (and like you said, the loot wouldn't be *that* much better). It's more of a trophy than anything.
---
I think holding better gear behind increasingly difficult gear *and* skill barriers would really help minimize power creep and the feeling of a loot treadmill.
---
Actions have consequences. I'm very certain this is blown out of proportion, make and hold the law in their ToS - people will learn quick. People who leave over one loot piece mistakenly not being given to them will likely not play the game for long and go back to BFA. 
---
Loot related or not I believe more people would get MORE frustrated at losing multiple pieces of loot in dungeon/raid pug environments because of the stealth ninja ways of loot trading. Plus the distrust it opens is much more important in vanilla IMO than the few crybabies.
---
So much backpeddle
---
If Black Desert Online taught me anything, offering horrible RNG as a way to try slowing a power creep climb is like trying to weigh down an elephant with only a kitchen sink. People will grind through it intensively, obsessively, and to unhealthy extremes - and the power disparity will become apparent. I wouldn't play on a separate server with those rules for that very reason.
---
Not all games need to be never-ending. Classic WoW is simply a pre-cataclysm museum that we're being allowed to revisit.
---
Fair enough, but... you did ask where the line was in your previous post? Why ask if you don't actually want or care about the answer? You asked where the line is, then when given the response, its called pointless because you have decided nothing is credible until its in game. Seems odd to ask in the first place right?

Would be a dick move towards everyone that purchased the original collector’s edition and there is no way I would purchase anything that looks close to that on principle alone.
---
Yes absolutely.
---
My mistake, clearly don't want to bother refuting any of my points and just want to flex with your CE you already cashed in on retail
---
Maybe open up that gate every now and then though
---
What about with BiS kt swords?
---
Some folks on my old server would claim that GM island had mining nodes on them that would never despawn and could be mined forever. Was probably bullshit, but it added to the mystery of wanting to get there somehow heh.
---
I mean I'll be a PvE player but I assume the PvP servers are the place to be population wise? At this point I'm very torn with Horde or Alliance. How about yourself
---
Shockadin is offensive spec.
---
There's are flight paths even in Searing Gorge and this map isn't showing them. It's most likely an early map, certainty pre 1.12.
---
Shockadin is a PVP / offensive spec.

Hit is not as important as Lock for Mages since u have the +3 hit from talents that u always gonna take. That's my opinion ofc, i'm not a super min/maxer:D

then i rerolled shaman to play melee -\_-

Now this isn't exactly what you asked for, but maybe you'd enjoy "The WoW Diary" by John Staats. Given your obvious enthusiasm for the subject, this book, created by John Staats, an original level designer for Vanilla, might just tickle your fancy.
---
Yep. Sadly it's hard to find a better map.
---
But I would hate myself for doing it.
---
No cuz I still have one in my closet unopened :)
---
Probably not, but I would buy a physical copy of WoW: Classic or whatever they stick with 
---
True, my answer should have been "Don't open the door to it". No sharding in the first place should be much better than the speculation of them doing it down the line.
---
Thats my favorite thing about a fresh server though, especially as a warlock who can level my tradeskills while leveling because I don't need to save every penny for a mount at 40....
---
Silk is one of the major barriers of Tailoring, and its lovely how when you get to silk, you can buy it on the AH at next to no markup for about a 3 week range and quickly get out of the silk tailoring area before the price of silk explodes. Mageweave and Runecloth farming I can deal with... but Silk... fml.
---
Lots of talk about gnomes. From my experience, gnome was awesome since you can go places that other races can't go due to their model size. The downside of this is that gnomes cannot do some of the fence wall hops and also makes other wall hops harder to do, which hinders their mobility. I used noggenfoggen elixirs or deviates for the most part just to be able to follow people in fence hops
---
In Black Desert Online do those upgrades require progressively more skill or just progressively more work? If it's just the latter then yeah, it sounds like a terrible idea. The barrier to gear should not simply be how much time you have to play.
---
A lot of dumb stuff. Killing Mr. Bigglesworth makes KT stronger, fiery enchant makes more lava spawns spawn, sitting in combat makes you regen faster, stam is the best tanking stat, standin together or in one spot too long makes Ony deep breathe more. Load im forgetting probably.
---
Then it sounds like you already know why they got tickets and media passes, since they're considered part of the media - not just random players who have preferential treatment.

yeah sadly that was BS. I remember going to GM island following a big expolit way back in the day. It was just a small island with a tree, and a house I think.
---
This is quite a tricky question, because absolute BIS weapons are swords, not axes and the gap is quite noticeable. 
---
And theorycrafting Windfury is quite a challenging task as it resets the swing timers. 
---
So you're trying to say that you don't think it's toxic in the same breath as acknowledging the reason people prefer PvE.

Most guilds required a threat meter, boss addon and decursive i imagine
---
Sitting in combat is a hold over from Everquest, where you did have to sit to go in to mana regeneration mode. It was never true in WoW though: all you had to do to get full mana regeneration was not cast spells for 5 seconds.
---
No, but I think it’s a great idea to rerelease it. A lot of players will be interested in it.

I love when ppl upvote shit like this in an attempt to discredit pservers or something (motive?) with literally 0 evidence.

Do you just hope nobody is gonna call you out or what?
---
&gt;She deep breaths more.
---
Well they're technically other players too. Both are equally bad imo.

Yep. I'm playing. Having a great time right now.

The only thing I have ever put on YouTube is a revenge raid on Orgrimmar. It’s from TBC not Vanilla, and it’s very cheesy!
---
[](https://youtu.be/JaZqCBLm_Wk)
---
Yeah, so I guess the question really becomes whether windfury is better than human sword skill. Anyone else have the knowledge?
---
Why do you feel that? Sure they can be annoying to 1v1 since their healing are through the roof but I wouldn't call them all that offensive.
---
If the pug environment is so rife with poor loot trades it is killing your game experience that much, it isn't hard to create a network of like minded players who won't play that way and connect on discord or something.  
---
I just won't group with people who do shady stuff, the same way I would have avoided a ninja looter back in vanilla.  If I do that my experience is unaffected with the added bonus of if something legitimate happens to me, or a guild mate, we will have an easy solution to fix it quickly.
---
Lack of pet control ruined it for me.
---
Sharding is being implemented to prevent underpopulation, not overpopulation. The vast majority of players who play on launch will be tourists who will quit after a week, in order to ensure that servers have a healthy population once the tourists leave blizz will have to set the server population caps very high on launch. Assuming a 90% drop off (which is an underestimate if anything) you'd need a population of 30k on launch for a 3k pop server long term.
---
That many people crammed into the starting zones would be unplayable. I played nost launch which had 10k people crammed into the starting zones, and the only way to level was to roam around in groups of five fighting over every mob tag. Now multiply that by three.
---
The AQ opening event is not subject to the same kind of problems. There isn't going to be a mass exodus of players after the opening which necessitates throttling the realm pop, so there's no reason to use sharding there, it's a completely different situation.
---
As a shadow priest, you will melt faces in pvp.
---
You'd gain more by swapping one DPS with an elemental shaman who sits with the warlocks with tranquil air and swap one of your 8 resto shamans with a priest
---
Sharding, cross-Realm zones, Dungeon Finder and Looking For Raid.
---
I never got one originally and would love one of these and would probably pay way to much for it too 
---
Me too. I leveled a warrior on a private server and got it to 41 a few months back and got my mount and was looking forward to experiencing the end game leveling zones and all of a sudden the server died because people were screaming FRESH and running to the new server. Soured me on private servers.
---
Too bad, because you should. It's just an opinion from some guy compiled in the list of items he liked. 
---
For example - you can make an AP-oriented lvl29 twink rogue which will 1 shot every clothie, but lose outlasting fights due to the lack of survivability.  As another extreme it could be a flag carrier with almost 3k HP twink which won't bring much damage but would be almost impossible to kill. Or something inbetween. Some items are are better due to blessing of kings on ally side and the others are better on horde. 
---
There are a lot of nuances and individuality you are blindly cutting off by circlejerking to the bis lists.
---
Without hesitation.
---
Unfortunately, It's human nature.  
---
I don't upvote or downvote a lot, but I know the opposite is also true.    People don't like it when others disagree with them.
---
It's like that t-shirt.  People just suck.  lol.
---
Bad bot
---
I checked Unstable Affliction and you're indeed correct that it wasn't a curse at the time (never was actually, it's truly an anti magic dispelling thing. Always played demono/destro anyway). As for Hex of Weakness, I don't think I had ever seen a Troll Priest in game until inter-server BGs, so indeed I didn't even know it existed - my bad, but please agree it's a very marginal case, and that the vast majority of SPriests simply didn't have any curses.
---
Curse of exhaustion existed but was plain bad in classic, curse of Tongues was there though. However, it was rather rarely used. Mages and druids removed it anyway,  the rest of casters were often supposed to be killed the fastest possible, not to mention that in group PvP, you're often expected to use Curse of Shadows/Elements rather than anything else. 
---
I did not want to sound harsh or question your knowledge by the way. It's just that I played my fair share of PvP as a Druid (Horde side), and Remove Curse was always more of a PvE spell to me. Only locks have curses, they can use only one at once, and its 1 second internal CD for a slow casting Resto Druid in a PvP situation is enough to make you forget about the spell entirely.
---
That's what I am getting at in so many words.  WoW was founded on being a more casual friendly experience than the traditional MMOs at the time.  The result was a better game that didn't punitively punish you for every mistake, which benefited both newbies and veterans alike.
---
Because WoW was more casual friendly, you also ended up with more people which meant more hardcore players.  I would be lying if I said EQ raiding wasn't more intense, because we were competing for the same spawns, but it also artificially created a loot barrier which made the game less competitive.  Compare that to server firsts in WoW, which put everyone on far more equal footing.  Because you couldn't be prevented from progressing it created a more competitive environment.  The same happened in PvP during vanilla WoW, it was far more intense due to how accessible it was.
---
I already said it makes no sense making those comparisons. 
---
I'll open the gate and call forth my mini Lord of Terror for you if you like. But unless you have the original CE i honestly don't think you should have the trio yourself. 
---
I seriously had to bike out over 50km in the winter cold to get a CE copy at an obscure store because my reserved copy was given to a hawt girl at launch night. And for me, at least, I will put so much more into seeing these monsters around if I know only original owners have them. 
---
There's no reason why to justify anything.  Just level or play the way you want and have fun with it.
---
I would, but I don't think they should or if they did then it should be a new updated one.
---
The original is worth a bit of money and this would devalue it, plus this is going to be a new era for classic it should have it's own extras.
---
&gt;Don't get how you can compare that. Like at all.
---
They are all old cosmetics. Both versions of the game should remain separate, otherwise deciding where the line is drawn would be a bit sketchy.
---
If you bought the CE at launch, you still have access to that in the game which you originally purchased. Classic is a reboot.
---
10k people per server is not going to happen. Be realistic and blizzlike, and not nostlike. 
---
So this feels bad, i mean the class I wanted to play was warrior but seems no one thinks warrior is an easy PvE class to play xD thanks for the input
---
No, these are facts.  
---
Whatever you're feeling is irrelevant, we knew what was optimal in vanilla and it was arms leveling.  and with that slow miss you get a higher hitting MS(Which blows BT out of the water), Whirlwind and OP.  
---
There really isn't any point of being fury until you're 60 and decked in BWL epics.
---
&gt; If the game stops at naxx it’s going to be great, but after a while most people will stop playing including myself. I think that’s a horrible waste of potential.
---
I disagree. Classic WoW is not being created to give you a game to play for the rest of your life or until Blizz goes out of business. That's what retail WoW is for.
---
If you get tired of playing Classic WoW, go play something else, just like you would do with any other game.
---
They've never banned a streamer for causing server instability by playing the game, but they have banned streamers for intentionally trying to get their viewers to crash to server.
---
Important distinction. This was verified again recently when Asmongold (who is supposedly "disliked/hated" by blizzard) received clarification that he won't get banned if he raids somewhere and ends up crashing the servers.
---
“Exclusive In-Game Pet”??? Seriously? Whoever posted this clearly didn’t play Classic...
---
a new classic collectors? Hell yes i would. 
---
I get what your saying but businesses in general are pretty damn unethical, morally bankrupt in general to begin with.
---
Not sure about 1.12, but Blizzard nerfed a lot of the leveling areas pre-1.11.  They added more ranged to the murloc camps in the swamp, they added additional elites between slimes in Mara, and nerfed the DM Lashers.    Those were the big leveling spots.
---
They also made ZG farming impossible by adding additional elite fish in the waters.  But that was for gold.
---
If conditions are perfect, which is rare, then yes at certain levels aoe farming is faster.    But that's a huge conditional.  There is also the time you have to wait or respawns.  So is it faster?  Yeah.  But over-rated.
---
&gt; I think it would be better to make classes viable like a Druid but you can’t go near what it is today.
---
I think having weaker classes is a feature, not a flaw. Let the PVE casuals pick a pet class and let the PVP casuals bubble or eviscerate.
---
Players who want a little more of a challenge are served by a game that doesn't make every class equally viable in every aspect of the game.
---
It's almost impossible that sharding will be involved as it's only in the starter zones (and you can't just invite to group to phase out like you can in BFA, so it'll be a bit RNG), and as you say the streamers will likely be ahead of the rush.
---
Instead of being a salty little hyperbolic bitch, why don't you prove what you're stating. Link me the video?
---
Also, as you will learn in life as you get older, people lie all the fucking time. Saying something doesn't make it impossible to do the opposite of what you've said.
---
Why can't you just invite to group to phase out? That's how it worked in the demo. 
---
the spice of life
---
One of the best things about vanilla wow is its sense of community. What you describe sounds very depressing and more retail like to me. Just eliminate the issue by not opening it up. 
---
Ninja looting was rare in vanilla because it was noticeable and easy to see done. It was clear cut and because of its high risk most people decided their reputation wasn't worth the 100% chance of being caught. Loot trading ninja'ing is less noticeable so in that case people will do it more often, and it does have an affect even if people don't do it often it, because will affect the way of peoples attitude towards unknowns. I love pugging groups, but this is going to easily make me just stick to my own group of friends, which is something Vanilla isn't about. It's about meeting new people in my experience, and that is a great part of the fun. 
---
Your supposed to support the decisions they do right, like giving them money for classic. Thats how you get them to change their ways.
---
And it's tiresome af. This subreddit has previously downvoted posts I made where I stated factual information with sources included. Like what?
---
Because that will not be required for launch. The demo version of sharding was just to get as many people into the two zones over Blizzcon week as possible, which is why people would regularly phase out, and also why you could group up with people. It won't be like that for launch.
---
The gameplay is slow enough that you don't even really need keybinds. Spamming frostbolt on Rag is not somehow more optimable if you're hitting 1 instead of LMB. It would probably only make a noticeable difference in PvP.
---
2 trees, the building from SI:7 and an underground room with a single wooden chair.
---
I've found the gameplay of holy priest and holy paladin to be very similar. Both are potent healers but paladins are objectively better simply because of the mana efficiency. In the grand scheme of things, I have more fun in vanilla playing melee dps or prot warrior, so I avoid playing healer. But something I've noticed is that druids(every spec) really get the short end of the stick in vanilla. The devs added druids and warlocks at the last minute and didn't put enough thought into balancing them.
---
Never heard of this one, what about it?
---
You can make money with mining for sure.
---
You can try to play around with this [spreadsheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0K52-VEkRDTeWI3U3V2LTVVYUk/view?usp=drive_open) but it overvalues WF. 
---
My bet is that best DPS is going to be troll fury with Gressil/Hungering Cold.
---
There's like 3 vanity CE pets and they're the only in-game thing to set the editions apart. I suspect only a fraction of the original CE holders will return for wow classic. 
---
Hunter. Just way too boring.
---
You disagree with a lot of people not playing after a while? Or you disagree with it being a waste of potential?
---
The point is that a 60-capped classic version of the game with new content could appeal to a lot of people that retail does not.
---
My brother had three pieces of T3 and he clicked. He was also one of the best DPS warriors on his server. He was top 10 on WoL for a fight in a later expansion. Pretty good player despite clicking. 
---
It increases your mana total and gives some crit%. Dots cant crit so, no. 
---
Harsh. I did not explain that correctly. When I said "same time" I meant same time. Ignoring other drops, based on that parsed loot table that mob would drop:
---
13.2% Some amount of silk cloth
---
33.1% Some amount of mageweave cloth
---
53.7% No cloth
---
Private servers (or at least the ones I've played on) seem to have done something like this:
---
13.1% Some amount of silk cloth
---
32.8% Some amount of mageweave cloth
---
0.4% Some amount of silk and some amount of mageweave at the same time
---
?
---
Swifty
---
There were a lot of items on Thottbot that had the wrong drop rate or did not even exist.  That did not stop people from trying to farm God's Needle, etc
---
I think you're very wrong and we will definitely see multiple 10k+  populations.
---
I'm probably one of the few people left on the planet that actually has an optical drive.
---
You mean that stream where his friend was **encouraging** everyone to spam the server so that it crashes?
---
And then once it was clarified that it wasn't Swifty doing it, and Swifty was AFK when the comment was said, his ban was lifted?
---
&gt;We recently monitored a situation where a large number of players intentionally disrupted access to multiple realms by gathering together and mass-spamming game emotes. In some cases, individual players spammed an emote upwards of 30,000 times.
---
&gt;As a result, some accounts found to be active participants in this activity were permanently banned. Upon further review, we have made the determination to reduce some of these permanent bans to temporary suspensions. We're currently in the process of identifying all offenders who acted to purposefully disrupt game service and will administer proper action to each participating account.

---
Orc still highest theoretical dps, 306–&gt;311 wep skill is not really that much relative to wf. The largest weaponskill benefit is the first 5 points and it starts diminishing quickly. The second 5 are still a solid dps increase but anything over 310 is not worth dropping stats for, i.e muggers belt + aged core leather on a combat daggers rogue is not worth over the stats of even the zg belt of preserved heads
---
fucking crinnngggeee
---
I definitely would, because I remember buying the collector’s edition long ago.
---
It would mark a new era of Blizzard actually giving a shit about it’s community again, which makes me doubt they will do it.
---
I'm always so surprised that the ` key is never included in these threads. Being just next to the 1 key I use it for some important binds. Blink is bound to it. Then shift + ` for rank 1 blizzard, and alt + ` for cold snap. It's highly underrated imo. 
---
He seems to just be a child in an adults body. He has promised to quit this and that so many times but always comes back in the end.
---
If you disagree with him he freaks out at you and bans you, and his community is somewhat a reflection of him.
---
Wow thanks for posting all this. I think a mega thread with all these different after naxx methods would be pretty cool. And a very useful tool to try to figure out the best way to do it or best combination.
---
I just don’t understand why some people seem so against it. If you have servers that stay in classic why not try something out that could theoretically be a whole new run at wow, just executed slightly differently.
---
When I was writing this, I wanted to just say Activision will listen to them... but more and more, I think blizzard itself is corrupted by this thinking and literally doesn't understand what makes games great anymore. And even worst, once classic releases, all private servers will be forced down since they can't allow any direct competition. Classic is our only hope...
---
Ah yea, that's where they put people to punish them haha
---
Stam WAS the best tanking stat after getting defense capped though
---
But what is a gear check when the gear they're checking doesn't exist? If the health and (avoidable) damage of the bosses scale faster than the loot those bosses are giving then as the game progresses players will have to rely less and less on what gear they have and more and more on what skills they possess.
---
I sort of wish sites like Thottbot and Wowinsider didn't exist because they took all the mystery out of the game
---
If they allow it (talking concurrent). I think they will simply limit it to 3k-4.5k.  
---
They limited it to 2-2.5k back in vanilla because technical stuff according to old developers. Got to remember these private servers did a ton to accomadte their 10k concurrent populations like spawn rates to nodes/monsters/items. View distance and all that sort of thing. Blizzard will absolutely not do increased spawns or lower view distance to allow that much people.
---
Also got to think about the timezones. In a private server 10k+ is achievable because its EU/NA/OCE all in one server. Its crammed because there is no option, and having multiple servers for your own timezone will allow them to do it the way it was intended.  
---
You don't "need" it but it's really usefull.
---
I am not suggesting to stick with a group of friends, but rather create a network of like minded folks on networks we have now to avoid the issue.  Similarly I know it is more difficult to track this, but it still in effect can be handled like ninja looting.  When you catch it speak up, if the community cares they will act accordingly.
---
I didn't find my play style depressing, I played the way I did because it was the optimal way for me to enjoy the game and it allowed me to avoid problematic stuff like what's described in this thread.  
---
It may not be for everyone, which is why I am suggesting players be creative in finding ways to avoid this, since Blizzard has already said these things are gonna be a part of the game and likely aren't rolling them back for the reasons they have listed.  I am pretty excited about classic WoW, so even if I am not a fan of the change at all (like sharding for me) I'm not gonna let it be the focal point of my experience.  This game has to be for everyone, it's up to me to carve the correct niche out for myself.
---
There isn't even an RP section.
---
Do you have proof of this?
---
This thread is amazing. I realise there are other WoW parents out there and this isn't unique but the number of other people with kids who intend on playing just warms my heart as anyone I basically socialise with these days are  parents of my kids friends. So other parents are my tribe now.
---
I quit WoW just after Cata came out and we were expecting our 1st. I'm a UK based Forsaken Horde player and I hated with a passion the Tim \*\*\*\*ing Burton theme park they turned the Forsaken starting zones into. I realise they were mostly empty, took an age to travel on foot from one end to the other, the Son of Argual was a pain in the ass, but imagination and good times filled the emptiness of those areas. Raided through BC and WoTLK but got a bit fed up with the whole "knowing the dance" is worth more than "playing your class" thing they had going on.
---
We've now got 2 (3.5 and 6 year old girls) and I'm intending on playing again come Classic. My 6 year old has seen me playing retail again recently when I was curious to see what it was like these days and she expressed an interest mostly for the dressing up. I picked up one of the old Brady Games guides (remember those?) for Vanilla which she might get a kick out of mostly for the pictures and the maps.
---
My "plan" is basically to play when the kids are in bed or when I'm in meetings at home in the evenings. Nothing major. Just going to take my time with the old content again.
---
&gt;Blizzard will absolutely not do increased spawns
---
This seemed to be false in the BlizzCon demo, with faster respawns and higher quest item drop rates.
---
This!
---
I have the original still. So it would have to contain some new stuff for me to want to get it.
---
Well that’s kind of my point boomkins just weren’t viable for anything. It would serve them well to make them viable so that there were more choices. There really shouldn’t be a class that is horrible at pretty much everything 
---

Currently just my D&amp;D 5e game every weekend. I'm not a video gamer really. I just want a good old school style MMORPG ... BECAUSE I love RPGs, and want their roots to remain as RPG and not some cash shop, easy mode, mass market piece of Sh@&amp;.
---
I sometimes play Day of Infamy to humiliate other players over how bad they play. :)
---
This is the thing though. I left after Cata came out and recently picked up retail again briefly and was aghast at what they've done to simple things like trade skills. There was a time you could login, farm low level mats in low level areas, level some trade skills, all very chilled and don't have to be all that attentive to the game. Now with the zone scaling and whatever it is they've done to trade skills this seems to be a thing of the past.  We managed without voice chat back in the day, think we'll survive without it when classic comes out so I wouldn't worry.
---
No. I don't need more crap. 
---
You sir are wrong. Pre raid fury will still out perform arms. 
---
For warriors humans in tier 1,  orcs for tier 2, then it switches back to humans. For rogues humans the entire time. Real vanilla experiences will differ due to starting at 1.1. Warriors and rogues both changes a lot in 1.8, 1.9. There is a reason no one plays daggers. Swords were BUFFED in AQ. To push that dps on horde is hard because you are completely dependent on the tank. Alliance is much more forgiving. You need people to do things like roll troll for threat on horde. On private you would be surprised what tanks where for armor/weps. People simply don't want to do that on PvP servers often (troll warrior).
---
yeah I also read that guys comment

Currently I’m playing through the Mass Effect series. 
---
I feel like this is the closest to the answer I'm looking for. It's going to be pretty much impossible to know for sure until we get to Naxx with legit vanilla values.
---
One Chinese guy helping you on a quest one time is an excuse for the Chinese to cheat and exploit the hell out of US East servers just like they did with vanilla and every single private server? 
---
What an awful take. 
---
My wet dream :-)
---
What awful comprehension of what I said. Keep the uncharitable nature, it'll definitely serve you well
---
Cheap labor in Poland, an Indie game, A Japanese game that is more of a platformer with multiplayer than a RPG, doom is the only one from an American Triple A dev in that list. 
---
Of course we do but why would I want to go to kargath?
---
But assuming tanks and heals are on point and threat isn't an issue. Some of these private server speedruns seem to indicate a more dps oriented tank is enough to hold threat hordeside. Who knows how accurate their values are though.
---
Because it gets developed by ACTIVISION. You have to be living under a rock to want them to change Classic WoW.
---
There are enough games I can play, I'm not that desperate.
---
Because what GMs need is a source of copper ore.
---
Token integration inside vanilla because gold simply means so much in Vanilla.
---
Greatly sped up release structure of raid content. Vanilla lasted years. This better as well. 
---
That's about it other than if the servers work poorly with a lot of people on screen due to new network infrastructure. I'm hoping that isn't a problem.
---
Things I would like them to fix to resemble vanilla more is itemization to mirror original progression and more patches or content. It won't make me not play, but I think it will hurt Classic a lot and they would be setting the game up to fail in a year. Much more on PVE servers. They would be pretty pointless. I am not playing on PVE , I just want them to have a good experience to.
---
So defence is the best tank stat?
---
They were still integrating it from their live client. Nearly everything on the demo is going to change.
---
Also that is a test environment and not a live actual environment (and its one zone for everyone).
---
Intelligence does not boost DoT damage.  It affects mana and a small crit percentage.  Look for +spell damage, +shadow damage, or +spell hit on gear.
---
There will be added content to Classic, pretty much on the lines that you argue. Most people assume that Classic can have a long life as a permanent game (no expansions, no new content), coming with the example that "it works on private servers". But they are so wrong. Like DEAD WRONG.
---
There are FUNDAMENTAL differences between private servers and Classic WoW (and I am not talking about game play or content patch release) , differences that if Classic does NOT continues with either TBC or new horizontal content, will lead to a dead Classic WoW in less than 2 years.
---
The Classic WoW I am talking about is the game that will be played on ActiBlizz OFFICIAL SERVERS, not the Classic WoW as a game.
---
What are the differences I am talking about?
---
First, players expectations. Secondly, the financial aspects, BOTH from players and ActiBlizz.
---
Players expectations from private servers are, at best, limited. Most want acceptable lag and acceptable game play. NOBODY EXPECTS private servers to DEVELOP GAMES, because private servers are NOT doing that. Also, NOBODY expects private servers to live long enough, before another private servers opens and everyone moves.
---
Players expectations from ActiBlizz are HUGE. We are going to PAY them to play the game. Hence, we EXPECT (at first) , no lag (with minor exceptions, like AQ event or massive WPvP). We also expect NO DYNAMIC RESPAWNS. We also expect A POPULATION CAP, far lower than private servers. Why are we expecting this? Well, because WE PAY for. 
---
And we don't expect private servers to do the same, because we DO NOT PAY FOR THAT.
---
The second difference is that not only we pay ActiBlizz for the game, but also ActiBlizz is EXPECTING profits. In other words, they expect MUCH MORE people than those playing on private servers, to PAY and PLAY Classic WoW on their official servers.
---
Why is this important, and how is related to NEW CONTENT (be it TBC or added content to Classic) ?
---
Let's assume that 6 months after Classic WoW is released, the population will stabilize to 1 million players. This means roughly $15 million/month for ActiBlizz. Two years after Classic WoW release, most players would had already stopped playing, simply because they finished most of the content, or want to take a break, or life happens, or whatever.
---
UNLIKE Vanilla WoW, when there was a steady flow of new players...this won't happen with Classic. UNLIKE Vanilla, when only few servers died out, MOST servers will die out after 2 years of Classic. UNLIKE private servers, which are FREE TO PLAY, most people won't start AGAIN...because paying money for a product that you already paid for and played it is not something people do.
---
Now, there will be SOME players that will pay again and play Classic again...but how many of them will? Well, NOT ENOUGH FOR ActiBlizz to open NEW SERVERS for them.
---
Most people seem to forget that ActiBlizz is the DECISIONAL FACTOR for Classic WoW. If they made $15 million / month for the first 2 years...will they be happy with 10% of that for ETERNITY? Clearly NOT. But they want to make money...and the ONLY WAY to do it is to KEEP PEOPLE PLAYING. But also PAYING.
---
Private servers will deliver an EXACT REPLICA of Classic WoW, for FREE, while ActiBlizz will be unable (or unwilling) to force those server to close.
---
So...honestly, what would most people do, once they paid and played Classic, doing most or all content ? REPLAY Classic WoW on ActiBlizz servers, or REPLAY Classic WoW on FREE private servers?
---
If ActiBlizz does NOT deliver TBC or new Classic WoW content, you can bet your ass off that in 2 years after release, most Classic WoW OFFICIAL servers will be as dead as the private servers that existed 5 years ago.
---
The replayablity of Vanilla exists ONLY ON FREE PRIVATE SERVERS.
---
It won't exists on OFFICIAL ActiBlizz servers, firstly because we will have to pay for, and secondly, AND MOST IMPORTANT, because ActiBlizz WILL NOT OPEN NEW SERVERS, because there won't be enough players to make it profitable enough.

And that’s only half the world!  God damn this game is great. 
---
So make your own BIS list that factors in that nuance.
---
At the end of the day, you only get 1 item per slot, so whatever character you build, that's your BIS.
---
Well, you didn't ask who was the MOST POWERFUL.
---
You asked for the most brain dead yet powerful pvp class.
---
That is Paladin. NO other class can potentially crush another so easily. They can put their entire dps rotation on a one button macro, have plate mail for passive defense (unlike active defenses that require skill to use) and other powerful defenses providing periods of total immunity. They are immune to snares. You just point a direction, run up to people and mash one button for the majority of the fight.
---
The class that most easily kill, using the smallest level of planning and skill interaction. This is because the class is built to do this. A paladin has boring offense because the rest of the time they are supposed to support a group. But, if you just want to pound on someone, don't have to care about strategic movement and planning and have time to talk to others in the house, take a sip of a drink and eat ... play a Paladin.
---
You need to get defense capped though, I believe it was 540? So bosses couldn't crit you
---
Retail WoW and Hearthstone. I still play D3 for a week or so each season, though I skipped the latest one. I guess I’m a Blizz fanboy.
---
Highest theoretical and also practical DPS belongs to Chuck Norris.
---
Everything else is speculation.

---
Oldschool runescape :)
---
I was tanking back in 2005, and everyone was doing pretty detailed EHP calculations, even sacrificing stamina for more mitigation when healers were good.
---
Stamina usually bought you the most EHP, which was useful when your healers weren't quite as attentive.
---
I meant for PvP at level 60.
---
We actually have a site with the dps shown from the top parsers. Not going to link it for obvious reasons (subreddit rules). People usually reroll in or around AQ so Orcs are on top with their BWL axes. Before that it's Humans in Dal'ends and then MC/Ony swords. There are good swords and maces after Tier 2 so Human goes on top again. It's just no one actually parses with those. People don't farm Naxx on Private. They usually do it once and reroll to the next fresh server and MOST reroll in AQ to be honest. That is why sped up progression or release of content in Vanilla is very, very bad. PVP breaks in late AQ Naxx and people just don't want to play it. 
---
Keep i mind how broken 2 accounts is on private as well. Example. You can solo farm Misplaced Servo Arm with a mage alt for your melee. There is a reason people quit. PvP balance that worked up until then kind of breaks, pvp gear becomes bad and on and on.
---
I am so sorry for what I am sure is the stupidest question on the planet.
---
I have just started playing this game again after 10 years, and I apparently have no idea what I'm doing.
---
I have a Draenei Paladin, lvl 32 - I am currently retribution, but I want to respec
---
I have visited 5 different class trainers, and they all just ask me to enter "the proving grounds" no one is allowing me to respec.
---
please, I'm dying - what the heck am I missing here?
---
It's not a huge difference for PvE, the fights are predictable enough it won't noticeably handicap you. If anything it just makes playing more stressful. For PvP on the other hand it just makes you a straight up worse.
---
Or, crazy idea. They could just not give the new CFO nearly 15 million in signing bonuses and performance review bonuses, and then they wouldn’t need my money. 
---
I’m not sure spending a ton of money on a nostalgia collector’s edition is really my thing honestly.   And after how much i feel like I’ve been getting screwed lately for preordering anticipated games, I am actually nervous that blizzard is going to goof this one up some how. 
---
Nothing in BFA is like vanilla wow.
---
If u dont want to play on private servers Beta is your only choice for practice
---
No, not really. The entire world/quests/classes/mobs/mechanics are entirely different. On PS the game is almost identical to Classic and you can play instant 60 servers to practice/try out classes if you. So yes you can, but not if you need to avoid PSers for some strange reason.
---
What sort of PvP do you want to optimize for? 2v2, 2vX open world, 2vX battlegrounds?
---
Introducing their "Play nice; play fair" policy with their report system.
---
Definitely not. Pservers are your only choice for practice. The games arent even remotely similar down to the very core anymore.
---
A lot of gold influx comes from vendor trash farming. Mages excel at this but there are mobs throughout the world that are good to farm.
---
Skinning is still a good professions while leveling but just vendor the leather. It's extra currency and it adds up later on
---
Gotcha. It's the hardcore private server game play in me coming out.
---
The best thing to happen in Classic will be the influx of new players without that hardcore focus that private servers have.

Apex Legends, Destiny 2, D&amp;D 5e each week.
---
Paladin is the complete opposite of interesting to watch. It really is just waiting for cooldowns and waiting relatively safely because of high defense and ridiculous heals and not having to worry much about mana.  
---
It's interesting to watch Druid or Mage PvP, where one small mistake means you lose. Where you need to use nearly every skill you have, constantly be on the move, and monitor your precious mana.
---
Yes and no, the whole raid is doable blindfolded with or without fire resistance, with green leveling gear

Running around in circles in BFA herbing and killing other herbalists while listening to some audio books Have had the 15 percent dmg buff now on this rogue for a month. Have the 350 dollar Blizzard Cap, Account time until 11/2021 and am currently farming the 10 token cap to sit in my bankers bags. At 3.5 tokens out of 10. Will run out of "BFA content" soon. 2.5 years of game time and 500 dollars in Blizzard cash in case they make WoW 2.0 is plenty lol.  If The Outer World or Cyberpunk 2077 was out I would play those. Played Witcher 3 twice already. 
---
Everything about modern WoW is bad. The raiding is bad because I hate the people who do Mythic and no longer want to play with them. The PVP is a joke with melee who have infinite mobility and "casters" that don't even cast. Everything about PVP is horrible outside 3v3 Arena that I got bored of in WoD. The last it was good was MoP. The only reason I logged in the last month is I was exciting about Classic, I was bored, I could kill furries (druids) doing herbalism and I wanted to catch up on some books and playing current WoW is mindless.
---
Correct. I'd suggest picking the casual pve server (there is one with the most pop ... small but still the most for a pve) that doesn't use dynamic spawning to test. 
---
If you want more players then any large one will do. You will get to maybe around lvl 25 because you enter moments where world pvp will begin to stomp you. 
---
Most are on later patches now so getting pre-BIS level gear is much easier if you actually get near 60. Don't expect easy dungeon runs on low pop servers however.
---
Or just wait and keep Classic fresh. There will be tons of players who will be learning the game at launch. I actually want to meet players actively trying to learn and enjoying the game. The hardcores I've been facing on private servers are typically unable to see Classic in any other way than the private server meta. It's why I'd rather avoid servers with private server progression guilds and hopefully fewer streamers.
---
Community is the #1 reason why I enjoy Classic. I know how to compete against hardcore players, but I do not enjoy their lack of humility and narrow vision of the game and community.

What if it was a mineable arcanite node? Good way for the GMs to make gold without having to cheat

Make sure to use the "A LOT of texture" packs. They look really nice :). For 1 I think it's just a stand alone MEUITM. 2 and 3 actually look better than the new game with the 4k texture packs.
---
In Retail? No effin way:D

Only on private servers. You should give it a try. For practice only, it is well worth it.

I love my original WOW collectors edition pets.
---
Mini Diablo for the win!
---
Why is paying  tribute to those of us that bought the original collectors edition a bad idea that will turn you off? If you didn’t have it in 2004 then why should you be able to get it now? 
---
19, in college. My roommate failed out of school his first semester coz all we did was smoke weed and play.
---
I assure you, hanging from their nutsack doesn't make you any cooler
---
It's not useful at all beyond the tanks. Healers will heal the fire damage on the raid easily. 
---
Permanent sharding, class "balance" and poorly implemented loot trading.
---
That’s because the collectors edition for vanilla already exists for those of us that bought it in 2004. Why is paying tribute to those of us that bought it bad? It’s not a clean slate. It’s a 15 year old game they’re letting us relive.
---
As long as it's different than the original collectors edition because that would make the value of them plummet. 
---
When Classic goes live, I can't see my forum conversations being on Blizzard forums. I'll for blue posts, but that is about it.
---
I'll stick with reddit and discord or private sites and put the major emphasis in supporting the guild.
---
I’m one of them, it will really cheapen it if new people can get it.
---
Incredible work on this site.  Its very simple and easy to follow, but I say that as someone already quite familiar with vanilla WoW.  I imagine it will be trickier for a brand new player to follow something like this, but they will likely be in the minority.  
---
Screenshot in case people think I am exaggerating. My banker is arcane to  blink to the mailbox and teleport back to the auctioneer. My rogue has gear on from the first month of content. Gear is so useless in BFA that it's still relevant somehow and I drop anyone but tanks and healers in about 8 seconds with laughable talents like nightstalker on sub. I just strike, dot for dmg buff, Mastery trinket on use, symbols of death, dance cs ss evisc, marked for death evisc, coldblood cheapshot dance ss evisc. Most players are so bad they had the auto trinket talent and can't even break the cheapshots. It's pretty hilarious. Awesome expansion/game. 10/10 IGN. :)

---
It's a good, good thing to be sure, as proven on private servers. 
---
My only question is how Blizzard will handle to Fresh/Old server cycle. Sure your character remains in Classic, but Naxx patch can really kill the server population if Fresh servers pop up. Only the hardcore guilds stick around. I hope Blizzard learns how to mitigate this.
---
Ah okay so you bought it back then? Try to put your entitlement aside and think what is best for the community and longevity of game. 
---
Also, Blizzard said themselves no crossovers. Retail CE is bought for retail not Classic. It wouldn’t be vanilla either since players wouldn’t have the option to acquire those pets like they did back then, in that sense it isn’t reliving and for some players will be a turn off. 
---
I don’t expect you to take any of these points to heart if you bought the CE, however those are the arguments against it. 
---
Is there anything more insulting than being called a pocket healer? Call that fucking warrior your pocket stabby guy. You don't exist to heal him, he exists to stab stuff for you so you can contemplate the duality of light and shadow or some shit.
---
Ive heard this so many times. The best player Ive ever played with was a clicker.  He got to an arena rating of 2250+ with an enhancement shaman in the summer of 2008. Back when enhancement shamans in 2v2 were a fucking joke. 
---
Were most clickers shit? Yes. 
---
Were there some players that excelled despite clicking? Yes.
---
This is the correct answer,
---
Essentially, BWL/ZG era is the best part of WoW Vanilla and after that with how strong Late AQ/Naxx gear is, the game falls apart.
---
POG
---
very cool
---
Should’ve clarified best gear on server then 
---
&gt;There really shouldn’t be a class that is horrible at pretty much everything 
---
Thats the thing, is druids arent horrible at pretty much everything. Balance is pretty horrible, but you don't just play a spec in Vanilla, you also play the class as a whole. They're not the best at anything, which is more of the point. Leveling up to 60 is very easy as a druid, since you have so many tools at your disposal. Bear form for high-damage fights, cat form for quicker killing, heals in between fights, innervate, battle-res, roots, hibernate... Druids are meant to be versatile, and as far as 5-man content goes, they can do well in every single role. You can go balance for Stratholme and Scholo if you'd like, and you wouldn't be horrible. If you want to raid as a druid, you're better off healing. Hey, raids *need* healers, and theres only 3 classes per faction that can do it.
---
The issue is that people want to change every spec to fix them for raids, a very small chunk of the game at large. It made sense that they made every spec viable in BC, as raid content was most of the game at that point.

Nope.  They're usually filled with junk that eventually ends up in a closet drawer somewhere. My house used to be full of this kind of shit until I finally grew up and shit-tinned it or gave it away to a friend.
---
I don't agree with this argument of "never" losing your playtime on official servers.
---
What if they bring out some ridiculous shit to the real money store, like character boosts and wow tokens? That'd kill the game for me, it might as well delete my account in the process.
---
Also, back in real Vanilla, people eventually had to go over to TBC, and later expansions, essentially making your old progress pointless.
---
In that sense, these private servers that have gone on for years are better for keeping your progress.
---
I'm fine with people in EU or AUS be able to roll as a fresh character in a different region (NOT ASIA THOUGH).
---
However, I don't believe you should be able to characters transfer to a different region.
---
But let's not consider druid as an acceptable rogue too, and fury warriors are a very nice rogue to rogue around as. Rogue
---
I want a sequel
---
But how does it make sense to gimp them for most content just because they were decent at 5 mans. I get that original wow had it that way but that’s why it’s a quality of life change. That way you can play as a boomkin. Boomkin literally would cast maybe a handful of spells and be oom. How would that make sense as a part of the game and how would the game not benefit from fixing that to allow for more versatility.

I found leatherworking to be very profitable as I had a number of patterns others didn’t have. LW also tends to not be a very active profession, so people will have far fewer craftsmen to turn to if they need something.
---
LW is really great when people aren’t farming MC as well, and is still good even into ZG. Once AQ20 hits though it becomes quite easy for people to secure good leather items so you really need to hone in on the niche items like epic patterns, resistance gear, etc.
---
Overall it’s very rewarding and fun but definitely not the most profitable, even with curing deep rock salt. As for skinning, so few people tend to have it that you can often collect a lot of free money. I was sometimes the only person capable of skinning black dragons in UBRS, core hounds in MC, etc, so it’s just more and more free money with absolutely no effort.
---
One thing that always bugged me about the old continents was all the dead space between the oceans and some of the 'coastal' zones. So much wasted room for activities. 
---
Well that’s why they keep the unchanged classic servers. Then if they royally screw up the servers with post naxx content who cares? You can just play on the other servers
---
No, at this point I am hesitant to give Activision-Blizzard any money whatsoever. 
---

---
Yeah I'm against character transfers and all that :)

---
I skipped most of Rastakhan Rumble, but you’re right that missing a full year might put you behind the 8-ball. It’s tough to get back into without spending any money at all.
---
Micro transactions would instantly ruin the game for me. If it was only cosmetics, maybe I could handle it, although I’d still be disgusted. A level boost? Instant quit.
---
No I won't. 
---
You won't be using tier gear as a holy pala in raids, that's for sure. 
---
I have so many games it’s sick.
---
During the latest GoG sale i got a few classics missing from my library. 
---
Currently playing Heroes 2 and Doom 1 with GZdoom mod to make it a bit more modern.
---
Man doom 1 is so god damn good.
---
Yeah i like’em old. 
---
For me personally the problem is that Naxx kinda devalues a lot of gear just like TBC would devalue T3 eventually. 
---
There is no reason to grind BGs anymore once Naxx is out and you have access to it. 
---
I like the early late MC to mid BWL era the best, therefore I will reroll quite often on new servers.
---
I don't think there will be mob tagging or 8 yard melee for taurens or being able to jump charge or being able to cc someone at the same time you get cc'd.
---
Blizzard forums are so hard to read.
---
What people need to admit is that classes and specs change insanely much with gear. Paladin is utter garbage with tier 1 and stuff, in any spec. When you have T2 you become decent with Shockadin/Ret. With close to bis gear with AQ/Naxx, you are actually very scary in PvP.
---

The only TCG set released at the time of vanilla was Heroes of Azeroth. Through the Dark Portal released in April 07, 3 months after BC came out. So the only TCG loot that is even eligible would be the Tabard of Flame, Hippogryph Hatchling, and Riding Turtle.

---
Oh yea! I played for about 5 years and unsubbed recently as my raiding guild fell apart :/
---
But i mean on the flip side once you have naxx gear you can do BG's just to have fun with guildies
---
cross server anything, this includes battleground
---
Because you have the power of a mage with heavy hitting spells, but with crazy high armor, the ability to heal in the world, and still heal most dungeons *as* that spec. 
---
Again, raiding isn’t most of the game for a high majority of the players. You may say it’s a quality of life change, but I’m not a fan of adding quality of life changes that are actually gameplay changes in disguise, like LFG, flying. 
---
You can very easily get blown up by a boomkin in a battleground. They cleave through your health, root you, run away and heal, blow you up and then innervate and repeat. Give them enough passive mp5 to make that a constant barrage and you have a problem.
---
There is possibly a “perfect” solution to make Boomkins raid viable and not OP in PvP, but it would have to be very roundabout and invasive to the original class. What would be a decent solution? Less mana costs? Then they become all-powerful wrecking balls that can sustain themselves, and still have 2 other roles they can perform as a class. 
---
I've been playing retail on and off for years but since i played classic servers i've been hooked. I played BFA for 2 months but after that i quit again...
---
Shaman, brings nothing unique and is bad at everything.
---
Currently Smash Bros and For Honor. Good time sinks until classic drops 
---
I do enjoy the international atmosphere that private servers offer, especially in contrast to my very own local region. Dividing the game into some larger regions is fine, but why are we locked into a single region in WoW, when all other Blizzard games offer easy switching between regions? The whole Battle.net approach to regions is just weird, with their different friendslists it's like they actively want to *discourage* mingling with those who aren't living down my street.

I started in Cata with friends from other online game. WoD killed the guild and any hope that the game will be mmo again. I'm playing classic on private servers on and off since then.
---
That's probably why they're erring towards keeping the games completely separate and not giving people with Vanilla CE their pets in Classic
---
&gt; Well that’s kind of my point boomkins just weren’t viable for anything
---
You haven't watched any vanilla boomkin pvp vidoes then?
---
&gt; It would serve them well to make them viable so that there were more choices.
---
How many different viable specs should the druid class have? They have so many already. Do you realize how much micro-managing and balancing would be required to give every class as many playable spec options as druids?
---
&gt;  There really shouldn’t be a class that is horrible at pretty much everything
---
Boomkins are not a class. They are one of many interesting spec options for the druid class.. If you are suggesting that the druid class is "horrible at pretty much everything", then I would 100% disagree with you.
---
Thanks Kanye 
---
yeah the game got worse and worse each expansion in my opinion. I guess its just the community and achievement you get from playing classic that keeps me playing.
---
ESO online. Just nice working through quests and dungeons but their all pretty easy 
---
I disagree that Classic WoW should be designed to provide years and years of unique play value. It never did when it was Vanilla, so why should it now.
---
If you want a Warcraft- based MMO that evolves over time and provides new expansions and features to keep you interested, **that MMO already exists**
---
The reason Classic WoW is coming is because players want the original game. It makes no sense to spend millions of dollars to recreate only to then start changing it all over again.
---
Keeping a rabbit paw (white item) in your bag gives you more chance to loot nice stuff. I believed that one for too long..
---
Buddy, the last blizzard game I bought was Starcraft 2 WoL. I saw straight through Activisions influence on Blizzard and realized everything after would be hot garbage.  I dont share an opinion with anyone who bought anything after that or anyone who preorders games since 2012, when everythings digital anyway lol.
---
However, I still play Diablo 2 and Warcraft 3 and enjoy how they handle those games.  WoW isnt my life and I dont care if they mess up. What is sad is all you kids crying “im nervous”. Like who gives a fuck, if its not what you just dont pay for it and play your private server
---
Kinda sad that the game has come to this, but it certainly shows your commitment and excitement for classic.
---
Edit: I figured it out, you hit N - I knew it was stupid.
---
The downvote feels unnecessary though?
---
Rimworld
---
I had forgotten that hunters would claim their pet could tank something was a thing. Must've blocked it from my memory. 
---
I recently got the whole Pools of Radiance series from GoG.  Wow that took my back to my very first computer days, sitting next to my older brother watching him play all the games.  Good times.
---
In an instant. Have all the others (baught tbc and wotlk used) but the vanilla version cost around 300 euros even used
---
I played vanilla towards the end and only ever achieved mid 50s so excuse my newbie-ness. Did vanilla have different stats whether you were male or female? E.g. male characters had more str but female had more int?
---
Nice
---
There are lot of options in tier 1 and 2 on Alliance, and loot is shared with rogues with the swords. I couldn't tell you what most guildleaders do with them. I only know they parse higher on the site as I always play horde. On horde you just decide if you want to break meters or do PvP and wait for Ashkandi (and that is what I do). Horde is also weird because a 2 hander at one point is highest dps with slam spec in early content. Slam is not really that BAD either on Horde due to windfury, it's just a lot of people don't want to play that as it's way more work. 
---
Don't worry about all this though. If you are more focused on pvp I would go orc and it doesn't matter if you pvp as arms or fury as it's good for both. If you care more about meters and will be on a pve server go human because the population is going to be FUBAR on PVE servers and you will have no one to raid with as a Horde. Dwarf and gnome are both good at pvp if you don't care about 5 percent less dmg.
---
Trust me if you know what you are doing, farm consumables, tank 5 mans as dps spec to equip guildies? No one is gonna care what race you are.
---
LOL you are acting like CE pets can be sold for thousands of gold and are somehow more than just a pet that follows you around.
---
It seems you are just butthurt that you don't have the CE and don't want anyone else to be able to have them.
---
If they take it and go full on OSRS that’d be chill. 
---
most of the people who are interested in playing classic aren't really interested in topping raid charts. That's the kind of mentality they're trying to escape by playing classic. It's a whole different crowd, compared to modern WoW it's a whole different game and social environment. I'm going to take a wild guess and say that people who are anal about numbers and use addons to track other peoples' DPS, and people who exhibit toxic behaviors that sap fun out of playing are going to quickly find themselves in a position where they've been blacklisted and have immense difficulty finding parties to engage in endgame content. 
---
Warrior has the highest skill ceiling in the game, meaning a great warrior can make a good warrior (in the exact same gear) look like a complete newb.  A bad warrior is super bad, a good warrior is super good.  Kind of the opposite of braindead class unfortunately, sorry :(
---
I dont think it would be a problem in a big scale.
---
Even if Naxx is out not everyone will do it. Or will have time to invest in raiding.
---
I have gotten some pretty hilarious messages from the other herbalists. It kept me going. I didn't report them or anything. I might not finish the 10 tokens as herbs have halved in price the last week or so. People are probably done with progression and no longer need them. Ah well was good money while it lasted.
---
Pvp? Engineering
---
Pve? Engineering
---
Apex, I haven't really enjoyed any BR game for such a long time as I enjoy this one.
---
I'm also still sadly subbed to BfA, so I login to do world quets and rated PvP for a cap. Then I'm done with retail and I go back to Apex or to any other game.
---
I can't wait for Classic, seriously I need it asap.
---
Since BfA was a flop i've been replaying some games, and trying others which i purchased but never got around to trying before.
---
-Mass Effect 1, 2, 3 &amp; Andromeda. (Although i gave up and uninstalled Andromeda after hitting an infinite loading screen bug, which persisted even when loading an older save.)
---
-Kingdom Come Deliverance
---
-Witcher 3
---
-Dragon Age Origins, Dragon Age 2 &amp; Dragon Age Inquisition
---
-Smite
---
-Vampire The Masquerade Bloodlines
---
-Final Fantasy VII, VIII &amp; XII
---
-Resident Evil 2 remake &amp; Resident Evil 3 Nemesis
---
I’m 23. Started playing the game in late BC on my potato. I’m actually playing apex right now with some buddies and it’s a blast, and we’re all also waiting for classic to drop this summer cuz that’s what we’ll be playing. Can’t wait 
---
There are still people who play Planetside 2? I loved it back in the days, but I didn't think the game had much to offer when the servers weren't filled.
---
Yeah it's fine as long as they space out the content long enough. With tier 1 and 2 nerfed so much from talents etc AQ is going to be a HUGE jump in difficulty and I think people will have a lot of trouble. AQ and Naxx Gear will still be rare I think. AQ is when a lot of classes have to respec to, because some specs/classes work for pvp/pve before then. Only thing I could see ruining that is if they sell a gold token. Consumables/resist gear are the main thing and gold will completely trivialize that. Decursive not working could possibly make encounters much harder to. Blizzard repeatedly tried to break that addon and finally did. Probably a lot of discussion around it. Is it even possible on the modern addon framework? I doubt it.
---
Yeah i hope they can release it in July but i think its gonna be late august :( . Would rather them finish the game than release it early tho so its fine. Hopefully a beta in the next few months?
---
Looking through the window after Golemagg to get +100 FR
---
That one's true though
---
No everything needs to have CEs. Seriously.
---
That’s what everyone’s hoping for yeah. Like hopefully beta is out by May the latest 
---
Forza Motorsports 7, Factorio, Stardew Valley.
---
&gt; In retail mobs would NEVER drop silk and mageweave at the same time.
---
Lol wtf is this, I distinctly remember multiple levels of cloth dropping from the same type of humans.
---
I think the fact that the weapon was redeemed by a major lore NPC in the next expansion is more than enough proof that there isn’t a way to do so in game. 
---
The fact that John Staats clearly stated in an AMA that he didn’t believe any unfounded secrets were left in Vanilla bolsters that point. 
---
Lastly, no, but we all have heard stories about people running around the entire Vanilla world in ghost form looking for potential hidden quests. 
---
If you think you’re the first person to take that clue and decide there’s something behind it, you’re deluding yourself. 
---
As is, a quick google will turn up a lot of Ashbringer speculation threads from the TBC era. It was in a lot of people’s minds then and a lot of time and attention was put into finding a way to cleanse it. 
---
^
---
Most likely. There dont appear to be any twilight camps or a Cenarion Hold in Silithus, which would put the map pre patch 1.8.
---
Yeah but the gear is also very out of sync with health. I personally dont enjoy 2,5k autoattack crits from a warrior or 6k soulfire from WLs or counterspell + 4k fireballs
---
Yeah, I really wish there was arena when I played as the people I played with went on to win arena seasons and even the first Blizz tournament. (But what is WoW compared to SC, Dota, or Adrenaline Gamer?) Still, I'm happy with just having made the server forum "best PvPer lists" and my PvE accomplishments. 
---
Actually worked for my team once in RFC. The hunter in my team was around level 17-18 though.
---
This was beautiful
---
Well i gotta upvote grinding breasts, imeanright?
---
How do you beat a frost mage? Freedom into spell steal, bubble into IB, stun into blink. You're perma slowed and they're not. I really don't see how you would win. You might make it a long fight by using bubble to heal up and LoH, but unless the mage goes oom before you, which is extremely unlikely, you can't do shit, can you?
---
Warcraft 3 lol
---
And they would usually resist 3 mass dispels before the bubble would even come off
---
No it dodnt work like that, races had different stats, although not by any real significant amount
---
OH god ya
---
Awesome. Thanks for that!
---
Or have the ability to do it either. Its noting special skill wise. But a lot goes into clearing it.
---
Multiplayer games have just more appeal nowadays . A company doesn't want to make inheridly (with some exceptions) good games but games that sell . One factor is that if a game is good it will sell . Calling witcher3 cheap labor is insane for real . It was backed pretty heavily.  Original sin was by some kind of way indie but that doesn't mean it was lacking . Ds3 was firstly an rpg and then a platformer. Also multiplayer in an rpg doesn't make it bad or anything . It was merely an option . Calling in a platformer with multiplayer is delusional.  Doom in contrast was the less rpg game of these if taken by story and narrative part (which is what makes an rpg an rpg) , which you was the only one that you didn't roast . Strange . Also the whole  America - Japanese  thing is sad for real . In the end you want a great game . And you tell me about all that American companies that do rpgs . If you pay close attention , today's rpgs that were actually really good in storytelling and having a breathing world were almost all non American.  
---
In the end companies will want money . Ppgs don't make that much compared to other genres .
---
You have no points . You just seem that you have yet to grasp the reality .
---
Classic is a good time for the warrior class, just keep in mind the difficulty of leveling. Watch a few guides and you will be fine, be prepared to tank dungeons. 
---
Dont know too much about hunter tbh 
---
Mage is awesome. Aoe farming is one of the most rewarding and interesting play styles in the game imo. A great first class to level for their gold farming ability 
---
you said "hey i had a good experience with a Chinese player so that excuses their culture of cheating" 
---
&gt;So defence is the best tank stat?
---
The point is there is no such thing as the best tanking stat. What you need is effective health so you wont die from the hits you take before healers can heal you back up.
---
The "best" stat will always be determined by the amount of other stats you have.
---
Having 75% damage reduction and 3000 HP is terrible. So is having 10.000 HP and 30% damage reduction.
---
It’s not too bad. There’s a five dollar welcome back package that gives a guaranteed dragon legendary and then gold from quests can help you pick back up. Plus if you only play standard you can D/E cards now in wild
---
im playng refresh r/classicwow page every day
---
Mage is a fun time in the pre-raid scene, farming stupid amounts of gold and the easiest leveling speed post 52 (dm lashers) I've leveled both mage and lock to 60 and I would go mage hands down. Unless you like the edgy boi style
---
Well, to be fair, I’ve never had a problem while actively playing — but I do pay into the game each expansion. I was just assuming a year away with little gold and dust banked could be rough.
---
There might be numerous people doing the same as you. Saving as much as possible so they can get tokens for Classic.
---
Those sites only exist because the players have a desire to understand the game and share information about what they discover. It's naive to think that the lack of mystery is the fault of some site that just does exactly what the players want them to.
---
Without thottbot, players would just be sharing this information through some other means, because randomly killing mobs hoping they drop the material you need to craft the item you want would be idiotic.
---
This is amazing lol
---
&gt;0.4% Some amount of silk and some amount of mageweave at the same time
---
In nearly five years of playing on private servers I have literally never ever seen this happen. Do you have a source of this occuring or are you just making this up as you go?
---
I’m 17 and have been playing vanilla pservers since Nost, and started playing WoW when I was really young in late tbc, although all I did was make a bunch of characters and explore the zones pre lvl 30.  
---
In classic I plan on raiding and going for r10 for those plate warrior shoulders on my human warrior. 
---
Yes 100%
---
Yeah when i started playing it was pretty much my first game so all i did was just level up toons and get bored and repeat. I'll be playing a warrior too, im really into pvp so il be focusing on that
---
It has great fights on primetime . You still see the zerg and the lag fights . They have added weapons , new implants and they have reduced the grind for them . 
---
You...you want to practice leveling? Sorry I find that really funny 
---
Nor is anything I pursue
---
Lol idc I’ll still call deadmines VC
---
I think you vastly overestimate the amount of people that are going to be running around in tier 3 gear
---
There will be tons of casuals
---
BFA (Mostly as I'm excited to RP a Kul Tiran) and League of Legends are pretty much all I'm playing while waiting. In the final month before Classic launches I plan to play through the WC3 campaigns over again so I can continue right away with the story when Classic is up :)
---
From what I remember from when I played... boomkin was shit, cat was shit, Resto was extremely sub par although arguably better off than the other specs. And every other healer had a viable dps spec they could play if they wanted to. I’m not saying they should be the best at everything but the Druid class was easily the worst off in vanilla. Boomkin suffered from massive mana problems, cat form was over complicated and even if you managed to get good at it you were barely keeping up with other dps, bear form didn’t offer enough to be a viable tank, and again heals were just lacking a little. I really don’t understand how making 1 out of their 4 forms competitive would hurt anything at all. I’m not even saying fix their mana problem and leave how overpowered their spells were. I’m saying rework it make it viable... I really don’t understand how you guys think that would be bad
---
Ignoring the salvation army guy outside of the grocery store on Christmas eve is uncharitable. I'm not sure you know what that word means. 
---
Ignoring the damage the Chinese cause on every single server they play on isn't just ignorant, it's dishonest. 
---
I don’t like giving Blizzard money but I defined would buy some sort of collectors edition. Idk if they should do the exact same one or something that kind of honors the same idea.
---
I plan on going tailoring/enchanting on my mage. Once I grind out enough gold, I'll drop enchanting for engineering, and have a level 5 pick up enchanting for disenchants. since you can disenchant everything regardless of level.
---
is that a viable plan?
---

0:30 got me real gud

Revantusk Village, too. This was from game's release and those flight paths weren't added until later.
---
This would be a sweet backround if the res was better. I like the style

Interesting. Wow is awesome.

Don't you have a phone?

On my server people said, that if the baron dies in the circle in the Boss room the mount would have a higher drop chance. 
---
Poland has cheap labor. You actually just had a writer leave CDPR to go work at Blizzard AFTER they lost half their value. Think about that. I view Witcher 3 as the greatest game of all time btw. Still couldn't be made in the US and turn a profit.  The only Triple A single player left in the US is console exclusives and they don't sell because of streamers. See the praise lavished on the Naughty Dog games. Doesn't match the sales and it doesn't match the sales because you can watch the game. Witcher 3 is different. It's 100 plus hours of gameplay that again can't be duplicated due to labor costs.
---
I'm going tauren I think. Orcs are too fugly for me. I'll try and score a BRE and then life will be :) 
---
I doubt I'll play enough to get into a naxx guild, even though that would be legit. 
---
It's ok in pvp, but you're going to have a hell of a time getting geared enough to do pvp well unless you go resto to get into raids. And overall Elemental is a much better pvp spec, enhancement is really just a meme spec for when you get windfury crits
---
Young man could you tell me what a yeet is? Or how I might go about purchasing one.
---
[Better](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/wowpedia/d/d3/Maggy.jpg) ? 
---
Its from the wow tcg
---
Enhancement Shaman is one of the most dangerous vanilla classes. You are fairly gear dependent though.  With the right gear you can kill people in 3 seconds or less assuming they don't nerf wind fury.
---
The fish in zg do nothing if you're on land 😉
---
Absolutely, I use ` for vanish since it's a key that's incredibly easy to hit in an emergency. The other easy combo I use is shift+space.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi1YNjZyHG8
---
This is how it will look. Its not very good its all RNG based if you get procs or not.
---
I personaly dont like it Since most of the time you are just standing there waiting for a 3.8 sec swing timer
---
That wont happen bro! its going to be the grind festival, no new player base
---
You will only need a sub, no other purchases required.
---
Welcome 
---
I'm 23, started playing properly in wrath december '08 but played a bunch of trials in late vanilla or tbc (cant remember the year). Have played some private servers and reached 40+ with a few chars and 60 + some mc bosses with one but stopped after classic announcement. Me and my friends have basically the same story and we're hyped
---
im 23, was 8 on release and played minimally. I will be playing a ton of classic when it comes out... Given its of a good enough quality.
---
Yes!
---
Non-viable, please stay out of my raids 
---
Yeah im super hyped too hopefully we get a beta soon or something 
---
As a pvper I'm quitting once naxx releases because the gear doesn't belong in the game. Hopefully they make fresh start servers shortly after Naxx.
---
yeah hopefully they don't mess it all up.
---
I’ve thought of doing a mage first since none of my friends are interested in doing it. Be the token vending machine and portal you yyou know :p then maybe try warrior later
---
Other keys have Shift modified to them, yes? Shift 1-5 Shift QERFCXZ thats 12 bindings one might use while holding Shift, yes? If you are holding Shift to use one of those 12 bindings, you suddenly can't jump because you bound something to Shift-Spacebar. BAD! SO BAD.
---
19, played off and on for 5 years.  Normally every expansion i renew the sub and level a brand new character to max to learn the game again and get some pvp in.  Ill be playing classic in hopes of actually experiencing world pvp again instead of warmode.
---
Loved it.   
---
But its called DM. Not VC.   
---
Please stop calling it Vc lol.
---
People believed that dungeon set 1 was good pre-raid gear.
---
yeah the difference between classic world pvp and crappy warmode will be huge 
---
You could definitely ping pong a boss back and forth between yourself and your pet. That was always fun.
---
Absolutely. As soon as it was available id buy it. I used to have a map of azeroth.
---
Speedrunning like in the video is overhyped...
---
but the video is nice.
---
Works fine with the off-tanking basilisk in Uldaman but that’s bout it.
---
Wtf is this lol
---
I had the newer version.. Legendary edition or something but anyways it was hands down the best MMO mouse I ever had.
---
No, not even close.
---
Great. Now I have to go to oncology. Thanks.  
---
I never bought the TCG stuff but man was the turtle mount my favorite mount. RIDING A FREAKING TURTLE. I wouldn't hate if they brought back TCG stuff (although I didn't start til the very end of Vanilla so I can't remember if TCG was around in Vanilla or not till TBC). 
---
Oh my god they said that on my server too, ha!  
---
I'd like to add that I've never seen it either. Not 11 60s, but 2 on the latest project and several up to 30.  
---
I'm 19, started in wotlk but been playing almost exclusively on vanilla servers ever since wod.
---
"its just nostalgia" my ass!
---
Isn't the BRE on private servers already itemized to the Naxx patch version? I don't think it is supposed to stack 3 times until a late late patch in Vanilla.  I could be wrong but I think i remember hearing that.
---
Gotta downvote you bro. You're a bad person. 
---
That annihilator pull at the end had me rolling.
---
thats my mouse!
---
My expectations of this were low, but then...  
---
holy lord how accurate can a thing be?  
---
I honestly just type Deadmines out fully now as a result of this stupid impasse.  
---
That or his weird ass clicker based movement made him harder to fight
---
Using VC makes more sense when Dire Maul is a thing
---
Further to what bwa said from the perspective of a network guy. If you want to actually monitor a guest wireless network with the tools/appliances on your corporate network then you would have to connect the guest wireless network to your corporate network. This will be pointed out the first time you face a security audit as it's inherently insecure. Why would you want any device owned by anyone to potentially be able to access your private network? And who has the budget to buy separate appliances/licenses to monitor a network that just provides internet to guests, visiting contractors etc?
---
Honestly, if that is your current configuration I'd review it, in particular if it's a network containing any sort of public or customer records because you would be in violation of HIPAA in the US or the GDPR in Europe and those fines are \*saucy\*, especially if you get breached.
---
I really can’t anticipate anything that would be a deal breaker. I think Blizz is going to do a good job recreating the Vanilla experience.
---
And I’ll be coming with it.
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Missing that one guy that's always like "whalecum" but otherwise perfect.
---
You will get fed up with the playstyle and the rng pretty quick, plus it takes a shitload of time to get to a point where you really have the potential to oneshot someone and to me its definitly not worth it. Enh pvp is a nice sideproduct if you are a heal main and grab some nice items here and there from raids but going all in for it from scratch is a waste of time and probably not what ur looking for. Warriors, mages rogues hunter elementals can do pretty much the same and still be viable in all fields in thr game ontop of it.
---
You may be thinking of Nightfall, a 2 handed weapon that procs a spell damage booster on the boss.  All mages and warlocks will do more damage if you keep the proc up on the boss.
---
:(
---
Im 16 and i started playing WoW when I was like 6. Definitely coming back to classic, lots of nostalgia 
---
I would say BWL gear suffices for ret if he has HoR. He still was no pushover, but man, you really wanted to keep that one away from you
---
yeah same i started at the end of wotlk when i was 8
---
Dire maul is 2 parted tho. So its not really DM anyway
---
I'm super young for this genre of games. I'm 14 atm and joined in legion. Saw how shit the game was and came to classic.
---
Great book
