Good topic. i have the same worries.
---

---
Back in vanilla i was a good T2 hunter. But this posts here helps.
---
now i will try a new adventure as healer and spriest. yes i am scared that i can fail, and the hard way to get 60 as spriest.
---
But i think and hope later in 5 man dungeons i will have a lot of fun with healing.
---
---
---
Sideways progression  is the dumbest meme this sub seems to have a hardon.  There is nothing interesting about running a new just so a few of your hybrids can get gear for garbage specs.  If you aren't making your character stronger than it isnt interesting.  This is why expansions are the only answer.
---
I can’t wait for Classic to come out I’m going to play and stream it everyday. Right now there are not that many games out there that can keep my attention like I know classic will. I know it’s not going to be the exact same as back in the day but I’ll still take 99% original or whatever it ends up being. 
---
oh totally, i feel like since the mechanics are always there but don't really become important to know until a certain keystone level it leads to a lot of people ignoring them and then going... AH SHIT I'M DEAD after a certain point, adding new mechanics could help that although i'm sure it'd cause new problems, what are you gonna do
---
it was also pretty cool to see more focus put on designing dungeons as a result, like? return to karazhan? that shit is lit
---
Then fuck off and play it, stop being a sook.
---
"ignoring variables like enemy players"
---
I'm asking which boss is the most difficult on their own (with relevant NPC guards  present.) Are some more difficult than others? Do we have any base stats available?
---
Hey thanks for the kind words and feedback.
---
I agree that only 2/5 shadow focus is ideal.
---
I don't think opening with holy fire is ideal. For example comparing Holy Fire -&gt; SWP -&gt; Wand combo to Mind Blast -&gt; SWP -&gt; Wand combo. Holy Fire only does slightly more damage after the full tick of the DoT, so using it instead of mind blast won't reduce damage taken by much. Both combos use mana at only a single point in time so time not regening is 5 seconds for both. Mind blast has significantly better DPS that outweighs its additional mana per second cost.
---
&gt; Mine is when I'm on a skinner
---
Mmmm that is a good one, running around shimmering flats.
---
What about returning to a quest hub and your auto vendor add-on reports you vendored greys totaling gold amounts not just 50s 10c.
---
Or being the only person in strat/scholo with the Argent Dawn trinket so all the scourgestones are yours.
---
Or like getting full tribute and world buffs and not dying until they expire on their own.
---
Or having a run on nightfin snapper catches
---
Or looting a quest item(s) from a notoriously bullshit quest on the first few kills.
---
Or like being 224 in some profession with only enough materials to make one more something that's already a green difficulty craft and that pushes you to 225 so you can make those bitching shoulders.
---
What an odd post haha, I had just posted about Dwarf Rogues too. I'm stuck between Dwarf Rogue and Dwarf Priest at the moment; i think they're awesome frankly. 
---
That ain't shit, hitting friendly players with a snowball to disrupt them while they're herbing and then stealing their herb as a tauren.
---
Dude I resubbed specifically for the return to karazhan. Blizz had a lot of good moves in legion imo. It's sad that BfA appears to have been such a dumpster fire (couldn't even bother to level to max after having played every single xpac since release lol). Hopefully the next xpac takes some lessons from the past and puts it to good use.
---
There are even some next level awesome things you can learn as a priest such as dispelling enemy buffs. When people see you going above and beyond without breaking a sweat, they'll remember you and you'll get whispers randomly because you're known. 
---
but I just explained how it can be also bought using Classic gold
---
charge is 25 yards, roots is 30 yards, fully talented it's 36 yards. probably won't make much of a difference, outranging enemies in pvp is a bit of a myth if you ask me, you'll rarely get to choose what distance you engage in.
---
wasnt a certain way to multibox banned at some point? maybe during late bc or wrath?   
---
feel like i remember some shaman had to alter how he went about it
---
There's no elementals for mages in vanilla though
---
Classic actually requires some team play, occasional CC and paying attention to aggro even in early dungeons.  Many players coming to retail are going to run into a learning curve in this regard, and may well blame the heals for dying the first 20 times they try to chain pull an entire dungeon while wearing quest greens.     
---
Do not take it personally, and please don't let it dissuade you from healing.
---
I just blame the hunter.  That's much less complicated.
---
idd, was just using it as a reference. I also know hunters that changed the gun sound to the silenced M4 from CS. 
---
Me too tbh even if it's me
---
How is multiboxing any different than 5 people playing toons? It’s not. 
---
This thought has crossed my mind as well. I can’t wait to see the blame and rage going around when people starting dying because of their impatience.  Im sure these types of people will make me hate Wailing Caverns this go around even more than i already do.
---
Well sorry for not realizing they're staggering raids. 
---
Maybe if you're a balance druid? Druids aren't about kiting they are about hit and run and casting roots frequently is just bad gameplay
---
Yeah same experience here except it was a few years ago. Grinding being hard like he described is awesome for me. Makes it feel more epic when you have to kite and tryhard just to kill same level mobs as a warrior lol
---
Paladins were the strongest melee DPS for the Alliance in Warcraft II.
---
You're so fucking clueless it hurts.
---
Wanting to PvP over meaningful objectives and resources in the world is gameplay I find satisfying. Stop mislabeling shit that I find enjoyable.
---
yeah totally! i came back for legion and it honestly was so much fun. i feel you there too because bfa was the first expansion where it took me forever to level up my main, like usually i'll spend abt a week or so just taking everything in and getting to max level on him but i found myself procrastinating on day 2, damn. i'm hoping it improves too! it'd be nice to play both classic and a good modern alongside each other
---
vs. Other Rogues, Dwarves are better than Humans. The ability to Vanish far outweighs Perception
---
In PvE, Humans are better, their weapon skill is very very good.
---
Escape Artist is nowhere near as good as people make it out to be. It sounds great in theory, but is middling at best in practice.
---
currently playing on the most popular vanilla server and there are so many new players who  have absolutely no idea what's going on. i don't know where they come from, but they're everywhere. ppl will get used to it and official servers will be less elitist anyway. 
---
but more importantly, expecting joy in every moment of your life is a very 2019-esque syndrome. people want vanilla back because the ass powdering, constant rewards and impossible to fail environment is simply not how to design a good game, let alone live a good life. shit will go down, you will learn from it and it will make you stronger. everyone's depressed nowadays because we don't face emotions anymore, we avoid or repress them, and, sadly, western life is rich enough to always offer you an escape in form of endless distractions. it would be really important for vanilla to stay not only a very punishing game, but offer free speech to the max. however, since blizzard is in control, they will 100% cater to sjws because that's what they stand for. so maybe you're in luck and people will get banned for throwing insults after a wipe and you can stay in your comfort zone for eternity x)
---
id go 29/11/11 over feral any day. Running around in cat form will get ur ass whooped real fast
---
Just don't be the hunter named Dankula that is too stoned to understand CC or control his pet.
---
&gt;I play WoW to do end game content and have fun...
---
Yeah you know what though, there are first year cs majors out there who think writing lua code for multi-boxing is fun.  Wanting to perform on a live server instead of a private one, a few hours of multibox dungeon grinding every weekend gets them their subscriptions paid for and then some.
---
He's saying that he didn't have rogues in his raid back in Vanilla, which means he most definitely never got past Vael and Suppression room in BWL.
---
I guess his point is that rogues are scum and nobody should invite them because they're rogues... or something like that? 
---
Ming? Grim? Daddar? Talking out your ass. If a loan warrior wiped four of you at once then no wonder you have no idea.
---
TIL Blizzard reads minds when they can't even read the BFA alpha feedback forums.
---
Yeah, he would certainly count. I found some info on him too.
---
Raids are really hit or miss. I've had pretty awesome raid leaders and never had to deal with people raging. That being said, pugs are pretty bad. You will likely get blamed for many things that are not your fault lol
---
My biggest concern is that the game itself will be classic, but the people are 2019 "raised on the internet" insufferable sploiters, botters, and well...A-holes. You can't fix that part. WoW could be nostalgic, it could be fun, or it could be terrible and completely destroyed by the obnoxious types doing whatever retarded thing it takes to claw to the top, that they've been planning since announcement. Hey, who knows, maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised. Haha....heh...hoo..[sigh].
---
Undercity would be pretty crazy to attack if it was the most populated horde city and the raid was tipped off giving horde time to prepare a defense.
---
Long hallway with guards at regular intervals provides defenders with an extremely long chokepoint to defend.
---
Warmasters in same room which means anyone whose BG finishes automatically ends up in the room defending her. Also people could quit out of BG to defend if the alarm is raised.
---
Was there an achievement for killing all faction leaders of the opposite race? Did any of the leaders drop anything or give honor?
---
I don’t really care if classic “fails” I guess, it’s not like Blizzard ever closes anything down anyway. A few thousand dedicated vanilla players on official servers sounds lovely. Hopefully they do it in a way that lets some of us optionally escape the FRESHcycle and chill out on PvE realms.  
---
I hope frostmourne isn't Oceanic. That was my og server.
---
Fandral Staghelm was a huge PITA with an AOE root spell, and summoning treant adds every 20 seconds or so.
---
Yes.
---
Achievements were never in Vanilla
---
I'd say he was the most difficult then, simply because he's the only one I've never seen killed. And he was the most often attacked that I was online to see. I ran with my guild on a killing spree and downed all horde bosses in 1 shot. Sylvanas was probably the toughest for us, not the fight itself, but all the adds constantly streaming in. Not to mention getting everyone through UC alive just to start the fight. Abomination spawns gave our healers hell from what I remember. 
---
:o 
---
There is serious joy in doing a solid job healing, knowing that you covered everyone ass, and most often it goes unrecognized BUT it is still totally worth it. And good people will see it and acknowledge you with an atta boy and that feels great too. 
---
Leveling to 60 gives you plenty of time to learn the ropes, don't sweat that. 
---
Since we are talking about same class my vote is for either 4 shadow priests and a disc priest or 4 ele shamans and a resto shaman. 
---
Also a note on Bolvar for Draka server. If we noticed horde brining only 1 raid to the table, we wouldn't even interfere. It was a common sight in city defense for someone to say "There's only 40 of em, let Bolvar handle it."
---
One guy gets to do 5x damage because he pays 5x more than others. Yeah that's fair /s
---
If you’re part of a decent guild, healers will not be blamed first in an encounter. That’d get old fast. 
---
Usually dps is the one that’s mindlessly doing stuff to chart meters and gets the flack. 
---
&gt; 5 people playing 5 characters
---
5 brains with 5 different motives for playing
---
&gt; 1 person playing 5 characters
---
1 brain with 1 motive for playing, but has 5x the means a normal player does
---
Literally automating 4 additional inputs, but it's not "botting" because blizzard gets more money from it.
---
Literally half of a team in WSG/AB is one dude, obviously horrible for the team that has the multiboxer (ruining the experience for 15 other people).
---
It only takes a minuscule amount of honesty to see how different it really is. As a single person playing one character, if I want a defense squad to protect me as I farm out in the open world, I have to convince them to do it (their motives are different than mine). If I play blizzard more money, I can do it myself and avoid those difficulties.
---
This. Also, as a healer in demand. Keep up the positivity. Add people that aren’t dickheads. When a good tank moves at the pace you like, add them. 
---
Best advice I can give is to find a group of friends or join a guild.
---
There are going to be those negative people in the game.  Just move on from them.  Do your part in spreading positivity by not jumping on others when they fail and offer help.  
---
Man ogres would’ve been awesome. They were in warcraft 2 for pete’s sake. And appeared in warcraft 1! 
---
Unfortunately they never got the chance; Blizz never really expanded their lore too much beyond the basic need.
---
They also wanted to nulify faction uniqueness in an uninspired (IMO) bid for equalisation. That’s why in TBC horde got a pretty race with paladin while alliance got an “ugly” race with shaman.
---
I still can’t believed they left ogres out but added... pandarens...
---
You can run with me. After ten years of tanking it's easy to ignore the complainers. We'll just boot them.
---
Cyber Security makes more than your fake day trading... lol. You need a hug man? I can give some financial advice if you want to live comfortably and happy. I may not be warren buffet but I have investments and a nice car/apt/pc/clothes.  I meditate and go to the gym too, great ways to be happy. Let me know if you need any advice. Sounds like you’re (I used the right one btw) in a bad place, asshole.
---
I think it defies common sense and logic to say WoW Classic will "fail". WoW vanilla had more players than WoW does now. They played the game for years and most of them were "casual" who didn't give one turd what Molten Core or AQ was or what rank 12 meant. WoW vanilla was an engaging well designed game and that never "goes out of style".  
---
I'm not saying it's going to be Fortnite big or even as big as vanilla WoW was but it certainly won't fail and I think it's going to popular for a very long time. Especially with good live support from Blizzard.
---
I mained a dwarf priest but want to try melee for a change. Let me tell you, mind controlling people into lava/sea/abyss got so bad, my class officer demoted me. I duelled him for fun on the boat and mind controlled him off the boat in booty bay with no HS... 
---
It feels to me that, in a post Game of Thrones world, they are more interested in creating “omgwtf” moments than an actual rich world.
---
This is why every expansion focuses on a few characters for the main lore while very little care is given to the little bits and pieces that actually form the WORLD of Warcraft.
---
Also Warlords of Draenor explanation: “don’t think about it too much” - Chris Metzen. Forgive, but never forget.
---
I've been practicing on a server that I'm not allowed to name for the past few months and it definitely isn't nostalgia. The game was just better back then. The sense of adventure is REAL in Vanilla. And those long runs back and forth across entire zones, are filled with interactions between players. The heavy rain visuals and sound effects make it atmospheric. The fact that normal mobs are actually a threat keeps it exciting because you really have to think about every move. Everything takes way longer but the process is actually enjoyable because you're talking with people ... there's a sense of community. And you get to know the people around you because there's no sharding/cross-realm bullshit. Reputation isn't just something you grind up, it's a real thing that you have on your server. You have your own rep! Wanna be a ninja? go right ahead! but good luck finding a group again after it's broadcast across trade and general. 
---
Balance between classes dps wise wasn't even an issue because every one of them was unique and brought something to a group.  All these people saying you have to play the meta in vanilla are talking shit.  The only valid reason for picking a 'meta' class and spec is if you're going for serious hard core raiding or a world first. People in Vanilla are a lot more forgiving than in retail, as long as you play fair. The toxicity within the community is almost non-existent, and it's not even because it's different people, it's just that being a douche bag just makes your life more difficult. People don't just leave group and disappear during dungeons. If you wipe, you're gonna do that corpse run and try again because it took you 45 minutes spamming in chat to find this group and another 45 minutes to get to the damn dungeon entrance.
---
I for one cannot wait for Classic. And if blizzard fuck if up, I'll just continue playing on the server that shal not be named. 
---
All great ones!
---
You can even play Goldeneye with dual sticks if you plug in two controllers.
---
Are you serious? Stay in your safe space &amp; play rogue... smh 
---
Yes Classic (A small niche product) is going to save Activision-Blizzard. Jesus Christ this sub is more delusional than the Star Citizen subreddit.
---
yeah mane, people played for the experience itself. but to be fair, it's easier when the game isn't terrible
---
I absolutely loved aoe tanking on a pally in Wrath, was the MT of a casual guild for a while and probably one of my best experiences in wow. I understand I need to roll a war to tank, is it anything like a pally? I leveled a war to 60 in TBC purely through dungeons but don't remember much (memory problems).
---
Same thing happened with runescape now oldschool is over double the playerbase as rs3, if they make classic wow well and keep adding content  the same could happen.
---
I don’t know many people who do pet battles or farm mounts that don’t explicitly do just that lol. Most people I know are are high MMR pvpers who couldn’t give two shits about mounts or pets, or raiders pushing mythic+ or trying to finish the newest raid. 
---
The majority of the people on this subreddit are literally the same ones you find in the capital cities complaining about the current state of the game on trade or general. They’re the same people who are awestruck when the REAL players in Vanilla came out of Naxx or AQ40 with epic loot that they’ll never see when the game rereleases. 
---
The DPS are to blame 99,9% of the time and it's infuriating. They do so many incredibly stupid things just to top the damage meter. 
---
It usually is the hunter. I hate hunters so, so much.
---
M+ is pretty much the only thing about legion/bfa that everybody likes.
---
Do you consider achievements not a part of a good experience? If so why not?  And although I may agree that the current version of the game isn't the best, the second part of your response is very subjective. 
---
With no pruning and all the toys being usable in BGs, I remember MoP wpvp and BGs as very funny. Some toys were insane for pvp but not many people used them. And I met a lot of PvPers thanks to Oqueue. Casual PvP was very fun in MoP and even WoD. Pruning, new honor system and toys nerf kinda ruined BGs in Legion.
---
You'll get yelled at no matter what you do. Group content in WoW classic is tough and requires full concentration of everyone. Most people don't have the best personalities when they're under the gun and have even worse personalities when they lose.  
---
Don't sweat it, if you know you're doing your best then why worry about what others think? You're the healer, they need you more than you need them. There will always be another group looking for you. So Hunter #1358 and Warrior #9996969 are advised to keep their mouths shut.  
---
Ultimately the best MMO experience is to join a guild you get along with. It will increase your chances of success and ensure people don't treat each other like shit.  
---
I'll say from my memories WoW vanilla wasn't toxic by nature. You definitely did run into assholes but in general people were well behaved because it was an actual world with an actual community that depended on individual players. Being a jerk simply wasn't profitable for anyone. I think that's a big reason why people don't want sharding in Classic
---
I need some people to play with and find a cool guild. Everyone I used to play with won’t be coming back :(( I’m super hyped tho 
---
Glad you're setting up the raid comp in my guild.
---
Classic will fail and North Korea will take over the world, anything is possible in the land of make belief! 
---
Will be fun to watch modern day MMO players learn the concept of aggro/threat
---
If they do gate them to 3/4 weeks after release then there will be no race to clear them because it's a given all the semi serious guilds will clear them instantly as soon as they open. In that instance the only race will be the 5 people that truly want to min/max no life the levelling race.  
---
  
---
Without them gated the race to get 30 people attuned/rep'd and with enough mana pots and +defense gear to get the kill will be an entertaining race across many guilds for sure.
---
i think only doing things for the sake of an achievement/reward indicates a severe design flaw. 
---
There really wasn't many great MMO's that where like EQ and WoW, so it really is a question of "is it popular" or "is there just no good mmo's that exist". I really dont know at all
---
That’s kinda what I thought and since my main was a rogue then I took offense. I didn’t raid past BWL just because of time priorities with having kids but I always had a consistent raid spot along with many other great rogues. 
---
And as far as PvP went we were amazing! Broken in some instances when we could literally kill other 60s with the defias set and a worn dagger just for lulz. Obviously you had to know what you were doing and the opponent was no t3 or rank13 but don’t talk shit on my brethren because we poo’d on you. 
---
I'm probably just going to play it.
---
If the wipe was your fault, own up to it and learn from your mistakes. If it wasn't don't take crap from anyone, they need you more than you need them. The group could progress after losing a dps, they can't progress without you. So they can learn to be more respectful unless they like searching for another healer and waiting a half hour for them to get to the instance.
---
Nuc was fun to watch as well. 
---
in vanilla the pvp trinket doesnt remove stuns on rogue, and rogue vs rogue is a meme matchup and you just get stunlocked (unless usage of ZG pot), but dwarves survive that since you can remove blind.  
---
Its a pretty nice advantage if you're geared against another rogues tbh, i would prefer dwarf. Gnome scape artist is really good but since you're alliance, freedom exist tho you wont get it a lot of times because those go for warriors mostly.  
---
Human master race in PvE, in pvp each race has a decent racial, being the NE the worst one in general, and human perception imo being the second worst one, its overvalued because of TBC arenas, since its mostly kill objective and a sap will win you a lot, but since vanilla's BGs are not kill objective (or world pvp), perception becomes not that usefull unless you know what you're gonna find beforehand
---
Classic can't die, I wonder how many people like me stopped playing wow a few years ago and have been waiting (Hopefully) for Vanilla to come back. I haven't had a computer in the last 5 years since I was travelling and such, but I will build a computer just to play classic wow. I can't wait to get back into WSG, AB and the old AV which sadly I've never had to chance to play. I was level 57 on my first character when BC came out. So sad... Haha! I totally want to live the true hardcore experience.
---
I don't like achievements either. As you say, it's subjective, so I'm not sure I can reasonably explain to you why I dislike them.
---
To make it short: to me it's something that cheapens the experience and I find it to be lame. I don't need in-game systems to track and show my achievements, let it just be known by the gear I'm wearing, by the name of my guild or because other people talk about what I did. World of Warcraft doesn't need all these systems. Retail is filled with all these systems and it's all just a pile of shit. 
---
have been trying out healing on a private server that shall not be named. i've never had anybody yell at me even when we wiped, the general atmosphere was very chill and forgiving and really helped me to practice my healing better. i'm sure there'll be douchebags come classic, but i think especially as you get to a higher level that kind of gogogo no mistakes allowed mentality will get weeded out, and it'll be easy enough to avoid grouping with the people who still act like that. don't worry about it :)
---
Roll a shaman and explore both worlds of healing and windfury crits.
---
I think the perfect counter argument is present in OSRS.  It dominates the online player numbers compared to RS3.
---
Never really happened when I levelled a priest in a private server. Druid on the other hand is rough particularly grinding for preraid BiS which is heavy in Strath. Had a few very frustrating runs. 
---
"Link curve"
---
I don’t know, unpopular opinion but I think the “healer abuse” is over played. I switched to healer last expansion and have seen very little hate come my way. 
---
I think the biggest problem people have is why players don’t get how to play there class with SOOOO many resources. Class websites, class discords, class YT channels, etc. There is no excuse to being clueless in 2019. 
---
It is mainly the set bonuses that make T3 so much stronger than anything else in the game.
---
What if we get Chinese version full of bread? :)
---
I only played Horde so I can’t say for sure who was hardest, but I can say for sure who was easiest: Cairne Bloodhoof.
---
Cairne could be kited off the mountain and his guards would eventually stop following you.
---
Also, he is basically just a crappy warrior with no real good skills. A few hunters can basically solo him. Whenever one of our real faction leaders was under attack, the entire server would go ballistic trying to repel an invasion. Whenever Cairne was under attack, we would let him become steak.
---
There's also a big difference between Wrath and Cata. Former being far better. Honestly for me, WOW is one of those games that got worse with each expansion. The only one that maybe was not worse is Wrath, it was just as good as TBC if not better, but it added LFG and that's where it flops for me.
---
Yeah, if you don't do your job correctly, people will get angry. How they specifically respond varies on the person, but to think the classic WoW community will be devoid of all the toxicity of every other online community in today's age is asinine.
---
If you can't stand under-appreciation, healing is not for you. It is a thankless job 90+% of the time. At least people notice tanks; no one notices a healer unless they do amazingly (which is even harder to notice in classic) or they perform poorly.
---
And BFA dungeons are notoriously easy. Honestly, everything in WoW is now. On the one hand, that creates a community that is extremely unforgiving. On the other hand, if you are failing at healing in current WoW, classic wow healing isn't going to be easier. You didn't say why you wiped; were you failing to heal or dispel people? Or is it general wipes caused by other people that just automatically gets blamed on the healer?
---
If you are only doing things for the sake of the achievement you are not gonna have fun. Achievements are supposed to take time, years maybe,and are supposed  to just be a small congratz. You can't say the game is flawed just because of the achievement/rewards. If you decide to play for the sake of an achievement in my opinion you are creating a bad experience for yourself and of course u won't enjoy the game as much.
---
The set bonuses! I forgot about the set bonuses! I just compared a random cape from Naxx to a random cape from C'thun.
---
The game is supposed to act as the dungeon master and you are supposed to create your own experiences. But like u said once the game starts overloading with Achievements and unnecessary rewards it doesn't feel fun anymore and it feels like the game (DM) isn't leading a fun experience.
---
Mass layoffs are not a sign of good health no matter how many people they are employing. 
---
Don’t forget getting to Westfall for screech..
---
If your OCE I’ll do it w/ you 
---
End of summer almost works though. I want it now, but people take breaks in the summer anyway. Also, plenty of time to get some hiking and fun with family in while kids are out of school, and then as weather turns, we have the best game ever made back!
---
Definitely. The barrier to entry is pretty high for private servers considering you have to find an illegal client and set up your realmlist file and all that.
---
There will be a ton of new faces since it will be so easy (and legal) to jump in.
---
In Wintergrasp in Wrath of the Lich King I used to (and still do but it doesn't always work now) go step on the invisible trigger bunnies on the bridges to respawn the guards for kills!
---
Also in Legion I found a bunny in LBRS if you break through the front door to reach what used to be the entrance area, it's only visible with Spectral Sight.
---
Bunnies make the world go round yo
---
That is true, and unfortunately extremely scary. Don't get me wrong, I think classic will be a success, but depending on a 15 year old game to turn things around is fucking pathetic.
---
you okay mate?
---
Well the reason people are worried it will fail is because blizzard is going to put micro transactions. Aaand if it’s anything like the demo it’s gonna be bad.
---
No it never was. Automation in terms of not being at the keyboard (botting), was and always will be.
---
People do that in Retail if they've been gone a few years, hopefully people will learn quickly but I'll admit it's a bit funny as a DPS when the Tank pulls half of the universe and we wipe and someone says "This isn't 2017 dumwad"
---
I'm only worried about those that left in Legion and didn't come back, which is likely not a huge pool I hope! Then again WoD...
---
Except that's not good enough for investors. Not all of them joined in 2000 and had their investment pay off massively. There are investors that were late to the party and their investment lost half its value. So yes, Activision is I deep shit at the moment, especially when it doesn't look like they have anything interesting on the horizon announced yet.

Tanking in Vanilla is very different from tanking in Wrath in that threat is much harder to hold, especially AoE threat. Vanilla warrior isn't at all comparable to wrath paladin, almost as big a difference as trying to compare two completely different tab-targeting based MMOs.
---
It was taken out before it ever launched
---
I'm not too surprised. Its a super easy way to do it. I did it all the time when making Warcraft 3 maps. Have an invisible, unkillable npc in an area and give it the ability you want it to do. Want a healing fountain? Place your ghost NPC in the middle of the fountain, give them a healing aura, modify some stats to taste and call it good.
---
There are ways to make your character stronger without just increasing your ilvl. Even if no individual piece of gear on its own is better than any other, the synergies between pieces can mean that your character is still getting stronger.
---
Lots of games are built around "equal but different" loot. This isn't some newfangled idea that has never been done before.
---
Actually had me laughing lol
---
I played on several private servers over the last few years, from small ones you probably haven't heard of, to the big one you definitely have (if you've heard of any at all). 
---
When I first stumbled onto the scene, I absolutely had the same thought about enthusiasm for vanilla being heavily nostalgia influenced. I had played retail from early 2005 to mid-Cata, with some pauses, but probably 80% of vanilla to Cata, including being in progression raiding guilds from mid vanilla to the end of Wrath. I didn't really experience difficult progression in MC/BWL, I don't think I hit 60 until about when ZG came out. I do remember doing my first MC in a mix of greens and blues, as a mage with somewhere north of 6000 mana and somewhere south of +50 spell damage lol. 
---
Playing on private servers changed my mind. Especially on the bigger population servers- the level of mandatory multiplayer interaction in the game, the fact that you had to maintain a reputation as a player within your guild, and as a guild on the server, in order to actually progress in content- sure, the raids themselves were not terribly hard, especially with 1.12 talents, but there was still healthy competition between guilds to see who could do the fastest speed runs of Molten Bore, it was still exciting as hell to get a thunderfury or Bulwark (and I was still playing as a dps class!) because it meant your TEAM was getting better and more competitive, doing pre-made BGs and fighting against other pre-mades you have seen many, many times, it's so much more rewarding than logging in to do a few heavily-scripted raids with random people you'll never talk to again. 
---
Sure, itemization was pretty bad for many specs. On the other hand, some items were so good, they were literal game-changers. When you finally had gear good enough to replace your bloodvine set as a caster. When your guild got a tfury. Hell even molten bore was worth doing for Rag loot, which was the best in the game besides Chromag/Nef loot for many classes, and when you had a good guild that could clear it in under an hour, it wasn't even that boring. World pvp fights in BRM, yojimba isle, wiping guilds as they tried to get DMF buffs. All this is fun as hell gameplay that doesn't exist in current retail. 
---
There may be an element of nostalgia in the initial desire to play classic, for many people. But the game itself was simply better then. For all its flaws, it was still a *better game* than what we have now in retail. 
---
Double the player base in a game where subs are measured in the thousands is hard to compare to a game with subs in the millions though. I enjoy OSRS and play a fair bit now that mobile is out, but it's an apples to oranges thing.
---
Uhhhh hello? Abolish Poison? Newb druid tbh. Not even gonna mention the clicking. 
---
This was the end of the Warcraft story and the end of WoW as far as I'm concerned.
---
Shadowpanther.net
---
in a good group you shouldnt get raged at but if you do just check out who you healed most, if it wasnt the tank you know something is wrong that isnt you
---
&gt;However when I tried healer in BFA everyone just got mad and yelled if we wiped.
---
Well, did you suck?
---
Honest answer: A sucky tank will get yelled at if they suck. Sucky DPS will get yelled at if they suck. A sucky healer will get yelled at if they suck.
---
Don't want to get yelled at as a healer priest: be a good priest healer.

---
 Seriously. Fuck haters. Wow classic has my money until I hit 60. 
---
I plan on playing a holy paladin in classic. I leveled ret until 80 and switched to holy in wotlk. The first few dungeons I healed I was kicked from and yelled at. But you either leave from your mistakes (letting people know I'm new to healing! And gearing up and YouTube ) and I eventually got the hang of it. I think being able to be successful at any role depends on how hard you are at working at it. You will always get criticism for anything you do. It's what you do with that criticism that dictates how you will do. I never healed during vanilla so it will new to me and I fully expect to be yelled at for not doing things perfect but I'll take it with a grain of salt and perfect my healing the best I can. It will be fun.

Show him the fishing minigame!!!

&gt;PvP would be awful

Because 1v5 is a winnable encounter in every other situation /s.

If you're 5v5 vs a multiboxer and your team loses, you should uninstall.
---
&gt; Gold farmers ruining the economy
---
So, how in your naive little brain do believe that multiboxers are ruining the economy.  Multiboxing is not autonomous, there's no 100% up time like there was with glider back in the day.  The spawn rates for high value mobs, herbs and nodes in the open world are finite and thoroughly camped by players.  So if a multiboxer would target these resources they're not introducing any additional commodity into the economy.  
---
That leaves dungeons, but multiboxers are not nearly as efficient at running them or as capable as five individual players.  The fact is that dungeons are farmed for materials and gold solo dmn, by duos dme/strat live and parties of 5.  Are multiboxing characters exempt from riding costs, mount costs, repair costs?  The gold they generate does need to go somewhere, whether it's one character or five, it doesn't matter.

It can fail in an artistic sense by offering an inferior experience to private servers. 
---
It can fail population expectations if very few people play a poor mockery of Vanilla. 
---
I think it could even fail financially, since Blizzard surely hopes for a major two or more years injection of $15,000,00/mo.
---
Thanks!
---
I'm planning to play a mage, but I'm trying to decide between Enchanting/Tailoring or Herb/Alch. Enchant/Tailor is a classic, but herb/Alch could be more profitable later on, especially if it turns out I might not have a ton of time to play during the week. Any thoughts?
---
Or you just do dungeon runs with mostly guildies 
---
How did you hit level 55 and classic isn’t even out yet?
---
How is the male troll crossbow animations? I love the bow animation and the way they squat when taking an aimed shot, but know I'll be using a crossbow for a while prior to the epic bow.
---
my brother got interested after hearing people (amongst me) get excited for classic, so I offered to have us both try out a new toon on a classic server. 
---
despite my frequent advice and warnings he soon got himself killed by being stupid, ran back to his corpse and soon after appearing again managed to pull 5 more, fled, got dazed and was killed. 
---
he immediately rage quit the game and I doubt he'll ever try wow again  lol. 
---
told the idiot that modern wow was probably more his style.

I play on a private server, that when I mention the name, the comment gets deleted.

Anyone got a link that doesn't go to Kotaku?

Your shadow priest should keep Shadow Weaving applied and other than that heal. As a support player you shouldn't care about the dps meter.
---
People will always shift blame off themselves. And healers are the first to blame then the tanks. You will have rogues try to “1v1” a 61 elite then be pissed you didn’t heal them enough where if they could just attack the tanks target everything will be fine. Hunters will complain that you keep letting their pet die. People who shouldn’t be taking any damage on an encounter will refuse to self heal and blame you if they die. 
---
You will be bitched at if you need to drink. You will be ordered to buff shadow protection when nothing in the near future does shadow damage. And depending on how rage and bubbles work on the implemented patch tanks will bitch that you are using bubble on them too much. Such is heals. You’ll grow thick skin. Just find a tank to run with and if dps wants to be stupid let them die. 
---
This subreddit isn’t for private servers, that’s why. Maybe look for that subreddit or find somewhere else to ask?
---
The wolpertingers were there all along, we just had to wear Synthebrew Goggles to see them.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/quest=11431/catch-the-wild-wolpertinger
---
Dont be afraid to call out idiots who are getting themselves killed. I healed in BC and wrath and people can be lazy cry babies with mechanics and try to blame healer. And sometimes people are just assholes and God forbid you let them die they lose it. Just tell them to shut up or threaten to leave if they are being a real ass. 
---
And if you do plan b theres no harm at all doing that. If they select pvp server and get camped they have no right to complain, they should of rolled pve. 
---
Im guessing on the more complex boss fights, the avoidable AoE's are bunny spells?
---
I wasn't old enough to play WoW in the glory days but I can't wait for classic. I have a ton of friends that are going to play too.
---
Give them a worthy experience and people will come.
---
Well. That explains it. Adios.
---
&gt;Easiest to kill is night elf in darnassus.
---
Yup, I was part of a raid that killed Tyrande for that sweet sweet War Bear. 
---
&gt;Sylvanas is pretty notable on the other hand. She's crowded with all sorts of annoying NPC's. The war masters themselves are decently strong,
---
Don't forget people dying in the elevator or getting lost in undercity. 
---
Is end game raiding really a 40 hour per week (minimum) commitment? 
---
Yah i have to agree. I'm all for classic (i can't fucking wait to have a challenge lvling again) but a huge part of retail is competitive PvP and PVE. I love pushing high keys in mythic + to improve my score and vanilla cannot provide that. I know in this sub we love to sick vanilla's dick off but retail has some valid points to it that people actually enjoy. I can't wait to play both 
---
You could get a pretty sweet mount: [https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=619/for-the-horde](https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=619/for-the-horde) 
---
Think that was added in TBC though. 
---
LFG was great because all it did was help people run dungeons. It didn't dumb them down or give inordinately better gear like LFR did. I generally do prefer Wrath over Cata as well, but I honestly enjoyed Cata despite the two major mistakes it made (talent tree overhaul and LFR).
---
How long does the usual dungeon take with the average group? 
---
It's not mislabeling at all. There isn't a good reason for world PvP that doesn't bring with it several dozen negative effects and consequences.
---
Didn't remember the title but found it! it is, Muse - Plug In Baby
---
The argument is so bad lol.
---
There is a reason we are still waiting on WC4 RTS
---
Yeh I didn't notice it until I was editing the video way back than, lol :P
---
Bungie just split, could we possibly see blizzard separate from them? Seems like they're kind of going down the drain.
---
That was my thought too. Little bunnies with 20 yard auras of pain moving in a set path. 
---
The chances of you playing long enough to get full Naxx gear is slim to none. Once you're capable of getting full Naxx gear, most good PvPers will already be in full Naxx gear, and at that point it comes down to skill and what class you're playing.
---
Thanks glad u liked it, yeh Muse is pretty classic! the second song was a little more odd maybe, Naruto had just released its first movie and I liked the songs from it so I think it might have been a singer from that.
---
But yeh cool to hear about the bugs in Wotlk, I guess it must have been fixed in even later expansions than.
---
They can be found with detect demons/undead and other tracking sometimes. For example, in ToS Sisters of the Moon, you can find the 'Glaive Toss Stalker' bunnies and find the exact points glaives will *always* travel to. The glaives don't get thrown randomly, they get bounced by invisible bunnies in the corners.  
---
Rhyolith in Firelands is chasing an invisible bunny that runs along the perimeter. When you attack his left leg, the bunny runs left, attack the right leg, bunny runs right. That's why he's so fucking awkward to control sometimes - if the bunny is very close to him as you're try to turn he'll spin around it trying to catch it and it's hard to understand why he isn't moving the other way.
---
"People are going to realize how bad it was when they start playing!"
---
Then why didn't people think it was bad the first time around? This game was an overnight cultural phenomenon. Was every just a complete moron 15 years ago that had shitty taste in games? WoW was a massive success because it was an incredible game. 
---
Like I said, I joined a really good guild.  Good enough to clear naxx before almost all the other guilds.  Whether I stick with it for 2 years is a whole different story.
---
Please get this aCtIvIsIoN garbage out of this sub please. Blizzard is fine, and Classic will be great. Every other Blizzard sub is a cesspool of negativity, overreactions, and blatant ignorance. Don't bring that here.
---
It really depends. A hunter in full T2 with xbow from chrom is still going to destroy most people. You won't see many people in T3 unless you're unlucky and get up against a premade.
---
Yeh I have no clue! but I wonder if this could have happened it it was a portal to TB or Ogrimmar instead, I would have to guess not since they are on a different continent and there is loadtime inbetween.
---
But it basically turned into a flightpath rather than dropping me through the world, so the game really wanted me to go to Undercity : P
---
While I agree you could also use it with raiding. Did people raid for the sake of gear or did they do it for the challenge? Either way it does make sense to be able to show achievements for doing hard stuff just like standing in T2/T3 on the roof of OG bank did. Achievements also give goals which many MMO players like.
---
Did you really need layoffs to happen to conclude that maybe things aren't going so well at Actiblizzard?  
---
From a race perspective it would absolutely be more interesting if it's not gated, otherwise it'll pretty much come down to RNG. But if I'm considering the possibility of people walking around with gear from Rag at the same time some people are still at level 20 because of server issues, it just makes more sense imo for them to gate the content for a minimum of 2 weeks. We'll see what happens, though I don't really have a lot of faith in Blizzard at this point honestly.
---
&gt;They probably will fuck it up based on their recent track record.
---
Recent track record of what? An underwhelming WoW expansion and the discontinuing of a dead e-sport? THE END IS HERE!
---
Chill out, Blizzard is fine. 
---
Ah cool! I do wonder if people could see you flying through the air, it really looks suspicious, I would not blaim someone if they freaked out.
---
&gt; Don't bring that here.
---
Yes please, only pure vanilla circlejerk allowed in this safest of spaces.
---
Damn, this is some of the most cold blooded shit I've seen posted here. And that's saying something.
---
Wish I could disagree but... yeesh... there's an element of truth there.
---
Dude would literally 1 shot anyone 
---
Yes! it basically turned into regular flightpath rather than an instant teleport, one way to nerf mages I suppose!
---
I wasn't really aware where I was going at first when it happend, I thought I would just go in a straight path until the end of the map.
---
But when I started to close in on Undercity it dawned on me, I was going to my teleport destination.
---
Don't be an idiot. The game isn't even out yet and people are saying Activision already ruined it. 
---
5 people don't simultaneously target and cast the same instant damage spell to instakill someone every 6 seconds, or farm something for gold then give all of it to 1 of the 5 players...
---
When Naxx is out everyone will have T2 and T2.5. So you’re asking if the difference between that and T3 is high? 
---
Come on dude take some control here and don't put yourself in that type of situation. If you're choosing to raid do so with a mature group of people that won't "yell" at you or anything else. You have the ability to minimize the chances of this type of situation happening to you. 
---
Pretty much.Also, didn't know that everyone will have tier 2.5 since AQ40 is pretty hard.
---
It same about efficient  in dungeons, because vanilla dungeons have pretty simple mechanics, i think only problem can be last boss of scholo with his teleportation, if he port tank. 
---
Anyway, i know how to play with isboxer i like it, but i want more social in-game, i want healthy economics, i want healthy pvp, i just don't want world of multiboxcraft. 
---
The truth really hurts doesn't it friend? Don't be blind to optimism. It doesn't change that Activision is laying off hundreds of employees and implementing money saving tactics on their end that is not conducive to the classic experience, such as sharding and loot sharing.
---
It’s not hard at all. I can guarantee you that most casual guilds will clear AQ40. It’s not 2004 anymore. 
---
Full naxx gear warrior with might of menethil will probably 1-2shot anyone in prebis even warriors. T1 you'll be destroying these guys, but you will feel their hits. T2 you'll be a fair amount stronger but not an insane difference. 2.5/3 other geared will be even'ish
---
Most casual guilds will wipe on Skeram then Twin Emps. Let's not even talk about C'thun. You're grossly overestimating the average skill level of Classic players (or you have a very loose definition of "casual").
---
not necessarily healer related, but one thing i like to do is to use the "sub-optimal" school to make the attacker panic and eat up one lockout. for example spamming mana burn (without faking) against a mage hoping theyll blow a CS on that -- at that point you can go back to healing. for a destruction warlock, freely using fire to damage them (which hurts like hell) until they panic and use their interrupt; then you're free to fear.
---
They won’t. You’re highly overestimating the difficulty of these raids as most people do. 
---
Mind control/mana burn if you got block on holy. 
---
Don't stand in the bunnies.
---
I am definitely familiar with Muse. The other song from Naruto I think I’ve heard elsewhere too. I bet the glitches are fixed at this point but back in the day there were a ton of glitches, to me personally, it’s what made the game even more fun. Of course Blizzard disagreed lol
---
There was a glitch In TBC where a warlock would summon people on flying mounts into an unknown zone in Azeroth and you remained mounted! Once you left unknown zone though it would instantly dismount you. But with help of lag software you could fly around for longer! Good times. It hurt no one, but was just fun. I believe Blizzard never fixed this one until a few expansions later when they allowed flight in Azeroth.
---
to be fair, dps are about 75% of the raid
---
Was about to say wow, blizz uses dummy locust casters too
---
&gt; Casual guilds will clear it in the first week.
---
Again, you have a very loose definition of casual.
---
That's the most foul, cruel, and bad-tempered rodent you ever set eyes on! Look, that rabbit's got a vicious streak a mile wide! It's a killer! He's got huge, sharp-- eh-- he can leap about-- look at the bones!
---
Good tips. I've noticed I'm not that good at fake casting, so when I know I'm against someone who can interrupt, like a rogue or mage, I usually heal a lot sooner than I would need to. (Like starting to heal myself at 75% health with a Flash of Light). That way, if it gets interrupted, when I'm back up, I'm at 50% and can Holy Light or throw 2 FoL in a row. 
---
It's really lose lose for them. If it does well the classic fans will be vindicated, if it fails the classic fans will blame Blizzard. 
---
I thought that was everyone on this board.  There's definitely 2 of us, anyway.
---
Micro transactions, pay to play mechanics, right click reporting, spell batching, cruise control addons, sharding, wow coins, loot sharing.
---
Do i have to go on? The game is gonna be a shit show with even one of those implemented.
---
Vanilla was a balance (not a balanced game) and everything ActiBlizzard is thinking about putting in for cash, will tilt it. They just laid off 100s of employees, cut the bonus system to senior members, retail is dying and the stock price is tanking. You dont think theyre going for the cash grab? All the morons on this forum sound like 2012 star wars fans. Completely delusional, always dissappointed.

---
If devilsaur is way too expensive, you're not closing in on R10 any day soon, and you can't raid for some reason, then you could arguably justify it to yourself to get black dragonscale. Just don't expect it to last very long.
---
I remember MC taking around 4hrs from start to finish. Onyxia could be easily another hr or so depending how long it takes everyone to meet up. I'd say you'd spend maybe 10hr a week including farming mats before hand, if you're just running tire 1 or 2 raids. 
---
Dungeon depending some are as quick as 30mins some last  2-3hrs depending if you do all wings or paths in side. 
---
TIL only sjw's play modern wow.
---
And here I sit, probably your definition of a sjw, waiting for classic.
---
Could you explain? Does that mean a good rogue does 600 dps and a great rogue does 900-1000? A good rogue does 300, a great does 400?  
---
And if you can, what does a rogue do to become a great rogue?
---
oh sorry, the picture didnt show that so well.
---
The person selling the gold has to keep farming it to trade. I assume people will do this continuously and not as a one time thing.
---
I wasn’t thinking of it as a personal thing. People doing it as a way to sell classic gold regularly. 
---
Equip vanilla blinders, downvote, repeat.
---
With tf and hand of salvation, would you say that ally locks shine a lot more in raids than their horde counterparts, due to worrying about threat less?
---
You are a China farmer not a multiboxer. Post on the isboxer or 5mm discord to prove it.
---
Is 1.12 the patch when rouges can stun lock and kill you with no gear on and a grey dagger!?
---
Next level, blame it on the hunter pet.  Then not even the hunter knows if that's true or not.
---
Faction/gear dependant but tracking weapon swings for extra attacks would be one. 
---
I'm hoping for the best, but honestly I think the community is  really hurting themselves crying 'no changes'. I get it if u give them a inch they'll take a mile... But seriously sending 1 item at a time while mailing- there's pushback against fixing that. 
---
Get a guild and/or core group of friends. You’ll be fine. It’s pretty obvious when you’re being yelled at my bads - they don’t matter and won’t be an impact on the server later on anyway.
---
&gt;  And if you dont want to be ganked avoid ~~ganking......FOR THE HORDE!~~  PVP Servers
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Fixed that for you.
---
It took blizzard 15 years to realize there is a vast community of gamers that lives for this shit.
---
It’s about what you expect. A good mage in tier 2 will beat a bad one in full t3. You can cobble together a very good set with just rank 10 pvp and the 20 mans without too much raiding. Mage isn’t a very gear dependant class. Warrior/paly/warlock you’ll get a lot of mileage out of t3 but it’s not like you become a god except to fresh 60s.
---
Depends on how bad you are
---
Needing achievements for goals is the sign of a bad game, players feel compelled to do things they otherwise wouldn't do for the sake of an achievement rather than deciding they -want- to do something of their own will/desire because it's fun.  
---
Modern single player games suffer from this as well to drag out play length.
---
The same as every other class during every expansion. Use your toolkit.
---
Your post makes it seem like fake casting wasn't around in vanilla, when in fact it was huge. It's not some magical thing that was invented for arenas, lol. There were still good pvpers in vanilla.
---
Raid ready is a meme for low end content. Will good/great players be minmaxing every item slot with full consumables? Yep but it's not even close to required.
---
Burger ples, I'm unemployment Russian who tired of breaking pvpstanding (pvp standing lol), but anyway what you want to prove abot isboxer? 
---
On 1.12 in few aspects is even easier to multibox, because you have OP healing macro, and debuff check macro, i had war/mage/2x wl/pala setup, done dead mines, bfd, but after i realize that it's pretty boring farming dungeons alone, and a stopped playing wow for a while and in this moment nost was released where multibox was forbidden, we played there , after few months from nost ded i with friends rolled to the small tbc pserv i played 3x mage setup, and my friends was pala and warrior, so we done all dungeons while leveling and few heroics, really don't remember what heroics exactly, or may be all of them, also i had blink keystroke, broadcast when you release blink button isboxer pushing follow keystroke after 0,1 sec or something. 
---
Id go Herbing/Tailoring. Farm mats for potions and gold with Herbing and you can craft your Epic BoP robe with tailoring. Leave enchanting to the hardcore players because many recipes are very difficult to obtain
---
How they will abuse it if you can't buy token with gold from classic, or can? 
---
I was looking for someone little less powerful.
---
Holy hell those are old.
---
Yeah true.
---
 I probably should of said If you get ganked chances are its because the other person has been ganked. Such a vicious cycle this life is
---
Ravager is pretty bad. You cant use abilities during its proc
---
they used bunnies for onyxia's attack animation too
---
also in WC3 they use timmy's (the little boy model) in the same way too whenever a unit casts a spell on a tall character model like archimonde
---
Had an entire 40 man raid die to him because some mage walked out of the AH and Frost Novaed everyone.  Saurfang just ate us alive.
---
It was mostly for bragging rights on the realm forums.
---
If you aren't coming through the back door you aren't doing it right. Varian knew this. 
---
All you need is "gold" farmers mass spamming something like this "14.99$ WOW MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION ONLY 7.99$ IF YOU GO TO &lt;INSERT BLATANT VIRUS SITE&gt; U BUY DVD NOW".
---
This wont directly effect the classic WoW economy which is 100X better then the outcome if they put WoW tokens in vanilla wow, however, this will be incentive to those who only want to play vanilla wow.
---
What?
---
As much as I want the "True Experience" the fact is that I hated WPVP and when TBC came out and rogues took to the air it was even worse. 
---
Because it's... What. Because it's going to occur in classic?
---
I really really like Kargoz vids, the class guides he has are really really nice and have quite a lot of research behind each of them and are entertaining imo. full disclosure I did help him work on a few of them but I still love his channel and work.
---
I'm a tank and I tank criticism and mitigate it for my healers. This usually results in me telling them what mechanics are and that dying is a DPS loss
---
Gnome rogues are outstanding in BGs.  They're quite hard to target via clicking them at range and make good healer assains. As a hunter, I'd typically hide in a bush somewhere while focus firing mostly on clothies and watching out for our healer, who typically wouldn't stay in a bush like they should.  A gnome rogue working the healer over was hell to target and kill.  In BGs, being hard to click gives you a much longer lifespan which is why tauren hunters just stupid to roll.
---
One...two...five!
---
So?  
---
Still not affecting Classic's economy in any meaningful way. So I have to use a spam blocker. Big deal. That's authentic vanilla.  
---
For a long time I thought it was "for me," not "before me." I always thought that in his dying moments, he got a glimpse of the hell that awaited him for the evil he had brought to the world, and that it was eternal blackness. 
---
Then I discovered cinematic subtitles.
---
Because the government is highly interested in my life in particular...
---
I get that and the type of chess feeling I got from pallys when I was AOE leveling a prot pally, but lorewise it just wasn't a good fit.
---
I don't think there can be healthy solution to prevent goldfarmers, too much effort(money)

Btw in Russia 6 months cost ~6,usd month, and you can play on eu servers, not only Russ ones, dunno about US servers.

Pretty much every game released today has Achievements though. Are they all bad games? I mean even Xbox has thier own gamerscores! I don't believe they take anything from the game. I dont feel as if anyone is losing any fun, and I don't feel as if players are compelled to do anything. If ur raid wants to go for an achievement so be it. An if they don't so be it. It's an mmorpg! If ur not gonna have fun then guess what? Don't do it! Half the game is making your own experience with thier storyboarding! 
---
Iirc WL t1 have more stam then t3 
---
Gotta love these cheap and easy workarounds. Its both genius and frightening. Reminds me of Fallout 3 trains being just NPC's running really fast with trains for heads.
---
The code behind many of the systems we use today are so hilariously patched together with any shortcut/workaround/hot glue gun the programmers could find.
---
I believe either some windows 95/98/XP code leaked and comments were hilarious, basically "We don't know why this happens, just display "Error, unknown fault, blah, blah, blah."
---
Wow thats some really interesting thing.
---
As a non-programmer i never thought about something like this.
---
Now i am curios to find out what stuff in azeroth is controlled by bunnies.
---
I see that affecting retail but I don't care about that. What effect would it have on the actual classic servers besides some chat spam that won't be nearly as bad as on private servers? The price of the sub doesn't change anything in the actual game.
---
They aren't because I specifically said they were bad if you **need** the achievements for goals.  
---
A good example of a modern (and old) game with a goal system that isn't achievement based is the Resident Evil series which gives you unlockables like unlimited ammo weapons/rocket launchers, other characters and costumes for doing what would generally be considered "achievement" worthy. Things like beating the game in 2/3 hours, not saving, using only 3 saves on hard etc.  
---
You're rewarded and enticed to do these challenges, not because of an achievement because you want to get these rewards for fun. Many modern games forget about adding in extra content like this and instead just put achievements in without any 'real' reward.  
---
And there are achievements that are even more malicious rather than simply lazy. For example "Fish 1000 times", "Collect 1000 Ore", "Beat this dungeon 100 times", "Complete 1000 daily quests".  
---
No one honestly believes these things are an accomplishment but companies do things like this to make people feel compelled to play more, just like how daily quests/time gated content compel people to log on every day, regardless if they're finding things fun or not.  
---
Vanilla WoW has so much random content you can do it whether it be farming, reputation gaining, collecting recipes/obscure trinkets, there's really so much to list. But it has more than enough content to keep people occupied for years without needing completely arbitrary goals. And when you don't have any more goals? Stop playing. It's not healthy for a game to compel you to continue when you would otherwise stop.  
---
Think of it this way, if achievements were truly just for fun then what's to stop you/your guild/the community from making up their own achievements/challenges? Back in Vanilla people did all kinds of things like beating MC with 40 druids, you could easily just say "alright guild we're going to try an immortal Naxx run with 0 deaths!", "we're going to try beat the raid with no consumables!", "we're going to try beat this fight backwards!". You shouldn't need a compulsive system to dictate activities and if you do, you should probably be doing something entices you with excitement instead.

For servers ask in r/wowservers

For classes [I found this video really helpful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0OMrgWBNK4).
---
thanks!

&gt; IF YOU GO TO &lt;INSERT BLATANT VIRUS SITE&gt;

Even in an anti-Token thread I find critics unironically stumbling over exactly why the Token was so successful in killing the Chinese gold farming industry and why Classic not having it will bring all of it back:
---
* [Why it would be irresponsible to *not* implement a legitimate way to buy gold in Classic.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a9qbj7/unpopular_opinion_not_implementing_the_wow_token/ecpoedz/)
---
oh man right in the nostalgia
---
Even bards have combat abilities in every game they're in.
---
Garbage specs? Uh oh, someone seems to be a bit close-minded. Nothing interesting for you, perhaps, but you don't speak for everyone, so while you are entitled to your voice and opinion, how about you let us have our hardon. Gearing an off-spec would be the ONLY way to progress your character assuming we keep naxx at top tier. Once you are in full t3, then play the game as a different spec. Sounds like fun to me! 
---
What is? WoW tokens? How will any of what youre saying effect classic?
---
Precisely. This is what I'd like to see. Options for gear. Gear in retail is awfully dull. Oh look, 32 more agility and stamina and 0.1% more crit. Compelling...
---
Vanilla encounters is mostly dps fights
---
you didn't answered the question or addressed the topic at all.  You even edited your post and yet contributed NOTHING to the conversation.  Just wanted to point that out.
---
I have not, which is strange really considering shift+letters close to WASD are great for the purpose, I simply never got around to do it.
---
spriest is probably one of the easier classes to level to 60, there is no hard way about it.
---
If you don't want to be yelled at, don't play an online game.
---
With that said, people in Classic are usually pretty appreciative of healers and tanks.  And sometimes mages.
---
I Agree that if your game NEEDS Achievements for goals your game needs a different reward system. Like u said Resident evil  found a good way to reward the player without using achievements. The conversation was about how Achievements ruined the player experience for WoW which they didn't (until they buttfucked the game with them) becuase the reward system for wow was alright at the time. I think we can both agree achievements don't  take anything from a game with a decent reward system already in place unless you overload the game with them or have dogshit goals like fish 10000 fish and sell your soul to blizzard for a Rune 2h.
---
Probably not considering it's a Kotaku article covering a conversation a Kotaku writer had with a WoW dev.  
---
I mean, serious question, would you prefer to read about this from a secondary source reporting on Kotaku's reporting?  Seems a little contrived at some point.
---
Due to respec costs healers are highly valued and carry weight. If you are a good healer and some scrub Hunter yells at you just have him kicked. With 40 man raids and small pop caps, there are only usually 2 half decent guilds per faction, no smart player will start shit with a good healer. 
---
Watch perplexitys vids and realize you have known very few good rogues. 
---
Short answer:  Yes.
---
Long answer:  Definitely yes.
---
I gave pretty detailed insight in my comment. I'm sorry it wasn't enough for you but then again it seems you barely speak English so I wouldn't expect you to appreciate me ACTUALLY contributing unlike you. Go ahead and fill me in on everything I got wrong. I'll be waiting for awhile I'm sure. 
---
I’m trying hard to understand you but I really don’t see how this will affect Classic or Classic economy. 
---
I personally think that WoW achievements had an immediate negative effect on the feel of the game and there were plenty of malicious achievements immediately I seem to remember.  
---
You don't need achievements for dungeons or raids when a single piece of gear tells the same story in a much better, more immersive way. You don't need an achievement for professions when just being able to craft things is testament to your craft.  
---
The game is better off without them, your character tells your story, not your account bound flashy link from a UI.
---
Oh yeah they totally had bash and stuff like the mountain king. Or did they have a heal, devotion aura, divine shield and resurrection. Holy prot is their archetype, not lol ret
---
I don't think they had an immediate negative effect on the game. That's just an exaggeration mixed with your own personal opinion.
---
I don’t know. I used to buy gold from the Chinese for years and years. I’ve never been scammed or anything. My order was always neatly delivered without a single problem. 
---
Many players wont even set foot in any raids. Then many will stop before AQ. Only a small percentage of players will be in raid epics.
---
&gt;There isn't a good reason for world PvP that doesn't bring with it several dozen negative effects and consequences.
---
You're literally against world PvP
---
In world of WARCRAFT
---
WAR
---
IN THE WORLD
---
OF WARCRAFT
---
IT FUCKING HURTS HOW STUPID YOU ARE YOU CLUELESS FUCKWIT
---
You are wrong. And you will see how wrong you are when Classic releases. 
---
Aaaand you just contributed NOTHING to the conversation 
---
It's certainly my own personal opinion but your position is also an opinion.  
---
It felt like immediately after the implementation of the achievement system people were less concerned with what was in the world and more concerned with ticking misc tasks off the achievement tracker.
---
Makes me want to roll a rogue for TBC classic if it comes.  
---
Buuuut I can't resist bombing people out of the sky on a mage. Was too damn fun.  
---
lol he's right.  Getting into raids required a bunch of crap most players aren't going to deal with.  Hell there's a good % that likely won't even hit 60 once either their nostalgia glasses wear off or they get frustrated with the spec they like being dogshit.
---
Let's assume people are willing to put in the effort outside of raids.  Now you need to find 40 of them that will log on around the same time and continually grind these old raids gearing people up to be \*good enough\* not great, just good enough to get to the next tier of content and funnel more gear into the raid. 
---
Classic was a test of patience compared to today's game.  Most encounters weren't hard because the mechanics were hard to wrap your head around.  The tools you had as a class were limited.  Threat was a huge pain in the ass.  The most important thing paladins bring is the salv blessing.  Tranquil air totem was hugely important in non-melee groups.  AoE threat is nonexistant, everything is single target sunders to build threat.  Onyxia is super fucking easy, stand in the right place and don't get a bunch of adds and it's just a war of attrition.  Why?  Tank threat is the other mechanic.  You have casters just freaking wanding their way to victory while melee are only allowed white dmg.
---
The encounters are simple because the way the classes were designed at the time were incredibly simple.  Overcoming gear deficiencies ended up being RNG in a couple of fights like Razuvious.... MC gets resisted that mob still gets the debuff and can't be MC'd again for a while.  You need the hit cap or you can wipe the raid with a single RNG resist.
---
Anyway I digress.  People are going to be fine killing the content, but to allude yourself into thinking it will be fast is stupid.  You can't "outskill" your way through shadowflames on Nefarion, you can't outskill your way through many of the resist check fights.  You either grind the gear out or hit the wall. 
---
Swap the two shadowpriests for 2 additional rogues/fury. Furthermore you only have 2 protections warriors. Unless your trying to min max you at least want 3.  I doubt you are, as you were suggesting 2 shadows. 13 healers is a lot. I'd drop 1-2 in favor of more melee as well. Probably a shaman or two. One in each group is not needed.
---
This quote is so brilliant that it needs to repeated:
---
&gt; Principal server software engineer Kurtis McCathern added that there aren’t as many invisible bunnies in WoW as there used to be. The WoW team’s tools have become more refined over time, so they don’t have to duct-tape rabbits to lasers as much anymore. **“Sometimes,” McCathern said, “you don’t know designers need a kitchen until they’ve made ramen in a flower vase with an iron.”**
---
&gt; But then you have LoL, HoN, and later Dota 2 show up and MOBA's get to be really big. Younger players start playing these a lot.
---
I still don't understand why people keep thinking that "younger players" play such games.  
---
Very few gamers I know are below 30, and they all play DOTA2, LoL, OW, TF2 and whatever else.  
---
I have yet to encounter an "age divide" in gaming culture, outside of circle-jerk places like Reddit.
---
In Classic Lore while the dragons are "good guys" because they protect the world (except black ones) , they would still kill any mortal that approach their lair.
---
So fighting red dragons would not be a problem, although I think killing an Aspect would be too big. Makes more sense to fight lieutenants. 
---
Later expansions made dragons less mysterious, much more cooperative and mortal-friendly. 
---
My hopes are always in the same place.  
---
I hope Classic will rock enough that Blizzard will release legacy servers locked at each expansion of the game.  
---
I have personally loved each iteration of WoW, and hold no grudge against any of them.
---
Hey, If you want their reporting to change, then give them incentive to publish things you would like to read. So if you trust OP to have found an interesting article, why not read it on their site? Maybe they will publish more stuff like that and less shit in the future.  
---
I had a hard time figuring out what your point is... but I don’t see how gold sellers being able to sell wow time at a discount is any worse than selling gold.. in fact that would only impact the retail economy...
---
I’m honestly shocked at how many people don’t understand why retail tokens are so bad.
---
Whos to blame? the achievements for allowing players to play like that? Or the players themselves who choose to play like that? 😱
---
Yes you did, however, a lot of people can’t seem to grasp the concept.
---
I just have you clear evidence that it WAS in the game, and you decide to call it irrelevant and the reddit hivemind downvotes it as always. Why is this community so beyond pathethic? Fucking hillarious that you people cant handle being wrong.
---
Three, sire! 
---
&gt;But ignoring variables like enemy players and the difficulty of reaching the leader,
---
I'm sure everyone will read this part and base their posts around it. 
---
Or not. 
---
Nobody really knows how weapon skill truly works.
---
I haven’t played since early MoP but I’m also not interested in replaying anything after BC. I never got to fully experience all of Vanilla and BC content. Wrath through MoP I played a ton and I got to see everything so I don’t feel the need to replay that content. 
---
It’s been so long since I’ve played I think a lot of the content will feel new to me. I don’t remember leveling my first two character in Vanilla, I vaguely remember some dungeons. I eventually cleared all of the earlier raids during Wrath but it’ll be completely different doing them at the appropriate level. 
---
I’m interested to see what they do if Classic is successful. I’d love to see BC servers. But I’d also want the option to stay on a static Classic server. I’d also think it would be amazing if they released new Classic servers that would continue to update with more content. 
---
I disagree with this. It's possible to get gear on any race, and any player can learn and get better. Once the two former is in place, the only thing that sets two players apart are the racials, making it the most important thing.
---
When it comes to psychology and peoples mentally it's always hard pin the blame entirely on the system but we recognize that compulsion and addictive qualities are powerful in manipulating people which is why we restrict things gambling and recognize that people aren't entirely to blame for their addictions.
---
There’s no way that newer players have the attention spans or patience for classic wow. It was like an actual fucking rpg back then. I’m pretty excited for it but I’m not excited for the shitstorm that will be newer players leaving in droves because they wipe a few times on deadlines or wailing caverns...”wait your telling me there’s no rdf and we have to actually walk to the summoning stone?!?!?” 
---
&gt;  the pet cancels the grenade stun 
---
That's why macros exist and are quite important specially as hunter. Otherwise frost trap would be useless as well since poorly managed pets are its bane. 
---
On the other side, eng brings quite more stuff to a combat and FD-&gt;trinket-swap (generally an already used active one to somewhat else, usually passive unless you can afford the 30 sec cd time) along the many trinket utilities eng brings are a great asset to have as is being able to craft ur own ammo and scopes.
---
Could her deep breath also be a bunny trigger? An invis bunny walking around the cave and when he touches a player, it causes a deep breath?
---
Send one ore two mind control caps before your raid enters. Saurfang is now a killing machime for the alliance
---
Some people like learning to play by playing the game and not by reading guides. 
---
I'd like a modern podcast about classic wow. Are there any?
---
Thats a good point. In Classic, when you spend a couple of hours with your group, you see them as friends. In BFA the group is only a tool to finnish the instance as fast as possible. 
---
I’d be down to join!
---
I guess these people always exist. But 5-man dungeons does not frighten me, its the 40 man raids that does. 
---
Dude fuck those toxic people, just find people who are understanding and not so up in their asses.
---
Heck you can start off with me if you want. 
---
Don’t let other people dictate what you roll.
---
Do what you want
---
&gt;paying attention to aggro
---
How important is this as healer? Maybe i should download an addon for it from the start. 
---
You’re an idiot, clearly you don’t realize how toxic people can be and there may be some people who are sensitive.
---
It’s an actual problem. It’s called toxicity.
---
Just because someone is sensitive doesn’t mean they are one of those people you’re alluding to don’t be quick to associate this person with a social justice warrior 
---
Thank you all for taking the time to answer my question, I'm very excited for classic!
---
This made me chuckle. Lok’tar ogar (or run),  for The Horde!!!
---
It won’t.
---
Not really. Racials give you a slight boost, but a skilled player should be fine even without the stronger ones.
---
I wouldn't worry about a threat meter at the start.  The times you pull threat as a healer will be either from body pulling a pat coming up to the group, or in situations where you can't easily avoid it.  Healing does limited threat.  As healer, you are for sure going to get aggro at times, but it will typically be in situations where you have little choice in the matter - like when no one has any threat on a mob at all and you cast a heal, pulling that mob.  IE when the tank is not doing his job, or the tank is dead. In either of those instances, hopefully you've got some tuned in DPS to peel for you.     
---
     
---
I think the way threat management will make your life as a healer more difficult is mainly indirectly.  - When DPS pounds on a target the tank is not hitting, or over threats the tank's target, you'll get (possibly squishy) party members taking heals at the same time as the tank, making it a bit harder to heal.  Managing your personal threat wont really make a difference there.
---
i dont think Classic will fail, i do believe there will be a huge peak of play at start, then a lot of people will realise it is not at all what they hope for and leave.
---
It really depends on the dungeon. The short ones like Ragefire Chasm should take less than an hour. Blackrock Depths is so big that a full clear can take all day, but you can choose to only focus a specific part and it takes less. Most dungeons are probably in the "1 to 3 hours" ballpark.
---
Orc resist is huge.
---
You will be at a major disadvantage compared to other horde rogues. It's not a 10 shadow resist or some weapon skill that increases raid dps by a solid amount- it's the chance to resist 25% of all stuns- a type of CC that rogue doesn't have a good answer to as insignia can't remove it.
---
But the biggest thing, and you'll see this a lot around here, is that you enjoy playing your character. If being a troll is more important than resisting those stuns, which is totally understandable cause troll rogue sounds pretty badass- go for troll, and if its the opposite, go for orc.
---
As you said I understand if people get mad when the same mistakes are repeated. That wont be a problem as long as I pay attention.
---
The reason for playing priest is because thats the only class i have not tried. Therefore I don't know much about it. I do know that they are great healers but also good in pvp as shadow
---
I haven't really had much of a look at more recent podcasts sorry, I would think so.
---
Though it's not a podcast, Preach's "Legacy of Vanilla" series on youtube is worth a look (a bit more modern look)
---
Ive played m+ (+13)  as healer and people never yelled at me. People usely get angry if you have no clue what you are doing. Just my experience. 
---
&gt;I have honestly no idea what a Tier 3 raid set for Elemental Shamans might do to the class. They could become unstoppable. 
---
Don't show up to Warsong Gulch Premades tomorrow.
---
Isn't Warrior T3 tank gear? Unless you just mean the plate dps bits from Naxx.
---
You could level with Enchanting/Tailoring, making your own bags, wands and Epic BoP robe on the way, then iff it doesn't do much for you at max level you could switch to Herb/Alch for the end game. It should be quick to skill up those two profs side-by-side as a 60 with an Epic mount.
---
You're right people usually treat healers better than a rogue for example. But i feel that my biggest fear is leveling a priest to 60, then i find healing in vanilla hard or dull. Then I need to start over. 
---
Haha you sir had me laughing. 
---
I don't think they'll deliberately nerf it, but the experience in classic but might be subtly different from the current pserver experience such that it's less feasible than people expect.
---
Paladins were as strong as ogres in Warcraft II.  They moved fast, hit harder than any other melee unit, and were defensible.  While ogres could cast bloodlust, which made horde in general better, the paladin spells were a reasonably inefficient heal, a holy vision for scrying that was superior to eye of kilrogg, and exorcism, which was meteor cleave damage to undead things.  
---
If you could get some paladins through to the death knights, you'd simply blast them to smithereens- that was the design of the race, really, though it only worked well on water levels.
---
classic just isnt for people with such mindset. rage quitting cause getting killed. i know some players like that. many of them just missing ambition.
---
Yep, I was just extremly confosed that you said you binded shift-9.
---
I couldnt get my head around it^^. If its comfortable you can bind like:
---
Alt-Q, Alt-E and Alt-1-4 or sth.
---
Thanks! yeh I tried to keybind atleast all the basic abilities that you regularly used, but I was still clicking important stuff like bandage, potions and even will of forsaken.
---
But yeh people were turning with their keyboard and all kind of stuff :P
---
I definitely had a newish computer around that time, as I recall earlier in WoW (pre BGs) I could not even get close to Tarren Mill because of the zerg pvp there because my old computer could not even handle it.
---
Fraps was also so taxing to use, if you record for 10 minutes you had like a 5gb file.
---
Just remember not to shield warriors as a priest but heal them instead. They will love you if you understand that small but significant detail.
---
Shams have problem with mana so you need something that give you mana, set bonus that gives you mana regen after bolt cast, for example but it must don't be really useful in pvpee. 
---
sugarcoated answer: no, just play what you'd like!
---
honest answer: yes. and in every other regard, probably - orcs are fucking gods in PvE too when it comes to rogues.
---
trolls are the sexiest motherfuckers ever and absolutely rule as priests and a few PvE specs (tanking, for example), but they suck ass when it comes to rogues.
---
&gt;  So SS and Evisc do not reset the swing timer right?  
---
Pressing sinister strike does not reset the swing timer.  
---
Pressing eviscerate does not reset the swing timer.  
---
Proccing sword specialization sets the swing timer from whatever it is to 0, causing you to swing your sword.  While this is always a dps gain, it is *more* of a gain whenever your swing timer is at maximum.  When white damage procs this ability, it's always maximally efficient.  When yellow damage, such as sinister strike, procs this, it's always a dps gain, but is only maximally efficient if your white hit has just gone off- for instance, if your mh weapon speed is 2.4, and you have 2.3 seconds remaining, a proc got you most of a second attack.  If you have 0.2 seconds remaining, you only accelerated your dps by a little bit.
---
No,  Blizzard had already buffed rogues a lot since that video was made.  Eviscerate scaling was changed from "nothing at all" to "the old damage is equal to about the AP you get out of blue gear", meaning that a rogue would need blue gear to be able to farm the terribads in the roguecraft videos, he could no longer do it naked.  
---
Good advice! I guess I have to talk my friend into wow, so that we can start together. He van tank and I heal, the dream team :) 
---
I think your in for a wake up call if you think there is such thing as a casual guild that going to even have 40 active members. Blizzard dropped it to 10/20 man's for a reason.
---
If people want to buy tokens then sell them on the BFA auction house who gives a crap and how will it affect you?
---
You say you’re shocked but don’t offer any reasons why you think they’re bad other then they’re “bad”.
---
I know people playing BFA that use gold they farm to buy tokens on the AH instead of paying with their own money for the monthly sub.
---
Mass loot was not present in the demo IRRC. Which means they already took the decision to remove it.
---
Of course they could still change their mind, but as far as we know, there will be vanilla-like looting. 
---
In raids against surgers and some aq trash.
---
For pvp if you have deterrence up and a healer helps out you can certainly surprise a warrior or rogue, but that's mostly on the healer, and even then you're getting back at range at the first opportunity.
---
Ofc why screw your customers? Wouldnt make much sense.
---
Pserver players coming out the woodworks dropping crumbs on the general populace.
---
Hunters have a ton of fun kiting strats in pve on top of a (relatively) complex rotation which keeps them involved even if they aren't topping meters. Downside is they get abysmal aq40 loot.
---
For farming gold it's usually mara solo runs or trib solo runs. The former is far easier and more reliable, while the latter has amazing payoff. Both worth trying out imho, assuming they're not made impossible.
---
Gear
---
To answer your question read OP.
---
In this case, bad means detrimental to classic economy.
---
There isn't going to be new content.
---
Personally I’m just going to play the game. I couldn’t give a rats ass what streamers or so called content creators have to say.
---
Pretty much the only time I've seen people yelled at in raids has been for completely failing to do important boss mechanics, like wiping the raid on baron or vael by not runming out when they're the bomb for example.
---
I am a little bit concered about the legion based classic client. Afaik many important macros a hunter used in vanilla will not work with the 7.3.5 build they are starting at. Knowing the *new* Blizzard, I am worried they will leave the macro  restriction to todays standards.
---
Woah I did not expect this on a monday morning :) 
---
Absolutely yes. Even with salvation and thunderfury there were situations where I had to hold back so I can only imagine life as a horde warlock to be miserable.
---
Btw you even can go for 10 characters boxing on wsg. 
---
A very interesting idea indeed. I want something after classic. Something new with the old ideals in mind. Not necessarily extra to classic, just something thats not designed like retail. Anyway thats just me being greedy, and im more than happy with what we’ll get this summer.
---
I wanted to empower you, but then I read your plan B. Makes sense that all those gankerrogues are frustrated priests :D
---
Priest, druid &amp; lock t2 :)
---
 &gt; The question of adding new content to Classic is a contentious one.
---
And the answer was negative.
---
&gt; Which raises the obvious question of what do people do next?
---
Either play for fun, start anew or quit the game. There is not much choice there.
---
Sorry for the delay. I'm not familiar with PvP for all classes so I can't completely make the WPvP/BGPvP distinction for all specs (and the classes/builds I'm familiar with don't really have them), but I think even classes like warlock are built/played slightly differently for WPvP and BGPvP. Soul Link spec is amazing in 1v1s with T2+ gear but I think destruction builds are better in group PvP since you'd want to burst down one important target quickly? Sorry I can't be more helpful with this.
---
Warlock: I was talking about MD/ruin being used in PvE, the only advantage of that seems to be -threat by having imp out, and you'd only want imp out when you're giving blood pact to the tank, but that's not worth what you're missing by going other specs. The build may have advantages/disadvantages but I don't think there's a reasonable situation where it's the most optimal spec, so I'm not sure about its inclusion.
---
Hunter: Survival is around T2+ gear and you'd still want one (or a few) marksmanship hunters to give trueshot aura.
---
&gt; who do you guys turn to for content creators to keep the memories alive
---
I try to ignore the streamers and hype as much as i can. How do they even help to keep your memories?..
---
In my opinion, when someone REEs at the healer, unless you *really* fucked up, they're just pricks. At that point, they've opened themselves up to being memed on. If you've ever seen the "healslut" memes, do that. I guarantee you that whiny asshole who's REEing at you will be absolutely **seething** when you do that, because you're just making a joke of his anger and laughing at him.
---
It's still a pretty dickish move to shit talk the healer on wipe, even if the healer was at fault. If you're just getting yelled at and nobody is even attempting to explain what you did wrong, you're playing with a shit group.
---
Nope, it's just that some people are trying to spin this as unimportant and normal.
---
i feel you. since i know classic will come in summer, i cant find fun in any other game. i am so hyped and the wait hurts. i tried to play on a private server, but i found it hard to keep being motivated when you know in summer everything you do now will be gone. nevertheless this weekend i started playing on that private server again. i dont know if that will affect my experience, when real classic releases, but its the only thing i can do. maybe i will just try what works best to be prepared for summer to get a smooth leveling. theres not much i can do besides that.
---
Lost Vikings is where all began for me :D
---
&gt;LFG was great because all it did was help people run dungeons.
---
It also meant you no longer have to talk with anyone except your guildmates for raids.
---
Show of hands who would go for a raid that drops T1 equivalent for your off spec when you're in T3. 
---
Hint: no one would go for that.
---
Also why would a fresh lvl 60 be able to stand his ground against someone who's in full T3? Of course they wouldn't. Same way a lvl 30 wouldn't stand a chance against a lvl 50. It's a RPG, you get more powerful as you go, it's pretty much the core concept. 
---
Make a T4 even stronger than T3. Doesn't matter. If you want to spare the casual players some pain, you nerf Naxx. 
---
Speaking personally, I played WoW back in vanilla, quit before BC, and didn't play it again. I never made it anywhere near Naxx, the furthest I ever got was a Rag kill. 
---
So I'm certainly not a hardcore raider and I don't actually have any plans to rain in Classic, not with a wife and child now. However, this is a topic of discussion that comes up a lot (adding new content) so I thought this could be an interesting approach. I'm well aware that Blizzard have said they have no plans to implement new content. 
---
Im just hoping that the vet's don't push out the new blood. Some people's view on new bloods aren't very nice, so i hope its one very small spectrum.
---
Incredibly common in many games 5-10 years ago. Just easier.
---
Riot was famously known for adding invisible minions everywhere in league of legends.
---
I'd love a day where they were all visible lol
---
True. This is simply a hypothetical discussion about how new content could be implemented without necessarily breaking the game. Given how often the question of new content comes up, I figured this could be an interesting discussion. 
---
You're wrong.  
---
Assume I want to buy a subscription for 8 dollars, to answer your Chinese farmer advert.  I go to his website, and give him 8 dollars.  What does he give me in exchange?  
---
- He can't give me a subscription token.  Here's what Blizzard says about WoW tokens:  
---
"You cannot **trade, mail**, vendor, bank, or destroy Tokens. Tokens purchased for real money can only be listed; Tokens purchased from the Auction House can only be consumed for game time or Blizzard Balance."  If he got a token for real money, he can list it on an AH, but not trade it to me.  If he got it from the AH, he can click it himself, but can't trade it to me or put it back on the AH.  
---
-He COULD give me vanilla gold for my 8 dollars, but now I'm just buying 8 dollars of gold, presumably at whatever his rate is.  This isn't great, but it's unquestionably vanilla- it was all over back in the day, at medium risk to the farmer and low risk to the buyer.  
---
So explain to me how on earth WoW tokens can interact with classic at all?  The only way possible is if Blizzard duplicates the WoW token ability in vanilla, where vanilla players can play the same trick that retail players do.  While there's a small chance Blizzard might actually do this, they certainly haven't announced it, and players would rightfully be very cross with them.
---
Oh I'm more than happy with what we have coming. My main desire is for the journey to 60 with my mates. I last played WoW in vanilla and I'm looking to experience that journey again. I have no desire to raid and never raided much back in the day, so this suggestion isn't for me. Rather, it's just a hypothetical about how new content could possibly be implemented. 
---
It can't so it won't.  OP doesn't understand the retail tokens.
---
WoW tokens have nothing to do with classic economy.  Give me an example of how a WoW token can effect the classic economy.
---
I think you’ll be yelled at more if you gank people as a rogue :D
---
Far too much.
---
Are you claiming that Blizzard has stated that they will be extending the WoW token system to classic, allowing you the option of buying a sellable token on either retail or classic?  While yes, if they do that, it will fuck things up, we have no reason to suspect that they are planning such a thing.
---
I am hoping WoW Radio is brought back...
---
Rogue's insignia doesn't break stuns in vanilla. Stun is the most common form of CC in pvp, especially if you're playing horde. Orc can resist 25% of those with a passive, completely shifting the balance of 1v1 duels, most notably against other rogues.
---
There's no real answer there. If you wanna tryhard, just go with orc else you'll be frustrated that your character is subpar both in PvE and PvP. If aesthetics are more important and you're sure you won't regret it after spending all that time leveling and gearing your character, then pick troll. Only you can decide, you seem to know what you'll be missing if you're not orc. 
---
"Horizontal" progression isn't progression. Good luck keeping your mages, warlocks, rogues and hunters (as well as all your hybrids who don't want to play an offspec) playing the game when there isn't any upgrades to aim for anymore. Allowing all specs to be viable through gear is a good idea imo, but there's a reason why "horizontal" progression was never used. We kill bosses to get shiny epics, if there's no more epics to get, there's no reason to kill the bosses.
---
they are going down thd drain, but I fear they're taking blizzard with'em
---
He'd just give you the retail gold to buy a wow token on the AH. But the entire though that a cheaper sub would have an effect on classic is flawed.
---
STV is legit one of my favorite classic zones. While the PvP server guys graduate from STV with eye twitches, PTSD and anxiety attacks every time they hear the stealth sound effect.
---
Indeed. Never understood al this nostalgia talking.
---
I've been playing WoW since late vanilla. Missed basically all its content due to little time to play (and being....well, late, as I said).
---
So I'm super itching for Classic. Nostalgia? Nope. Just never had the chance to really enjoy vanilla for good and with Classic I'll finally have that chance. 
---
What does that have to do with nostalgia? Very little, believe me. 
---
Ok, so I give him 8 dollars, and he gives me enough retail gold to buy a WoW token on the retail AH.  He sold me 8 dollars of retail gold in exchange for 8 dollars.   That doesn't seem like it impact's classic's economy in any way- no actual classic gold changed hands.  Given that classic subscriptions are the same thing as retail subscriptions, I think that's going to be a larger impact than anything else.  
---
Good try though, I really don't know what the guys in this thread are thinking, yours is the closest thing to an explanation.
---
10/10 shitpost 
---
Countdown to classic is the best one out there. He’s got his own website, check it out
---
I assume you want a composition that will work all the way from MC to Naxx. I'd go with something like this.
---
* 2 restodruids
---
* 4 hunters
---
* 6 mages
---
* 4 holypriests
---
* 1 shadowpriest
---
* 4 rogues
---
* 6 restoshamans
---
* 5 warlocks
---
* 3 protwarriors
---
* 5 furywarriors
---
Shandris Feathermoon anyone ?
---
I'd argue slice and dice mace/dagger builds work well - though getting an Ironfoe and Felstriker is pretty hard to weasel.
---
 \&gt;*I just love how big they are* 
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Fighting for ressources happens whether you can fly or not. You can't grind on your mount.
---
Will do, thanks for the suggestion
---
3% crit aura in tank group = 3% more threat = 3% more dps for the whole raid if dps are threat capped.
---
Feral are also great offtank and can make some encounter easier if they tank it (ragnaros, bloodlord lashlayer, patchwerk, any encounter where you want high threat)
---
Also make gearing the tanks faster since the only gear feral and war only share cloak ring and neck.
---
I just don't understand how someone can think the first three to be great and then hate on Cataclysm, aside from the world revamp it backtracked a lot of the choices made in WoTLK that steered away from earlier game design from TBC and Classic, the outrage made them have to revert it but Cataclysm launch was amazing, Blizzard has never gotten PvE as right as they did in T11, and I was raiding in a 10 man guild and was properly fucked that tier as well.
---
Or if they'll introduce TBC at some point.
---
The vanilla systems were fundamentally flawed.  Classic is recreating those flaws faithfully- for the purpose of this entire game, they *aren't flaws at all*.  Sure, surprise tricks like four horsemen won't be there to kill guilds, but the actual gearing drop rate is very low, and it will take dedicated guilds who trust each other to clear content, guilds who have avoided loot drama completely.  Those guilds will exist- you can see some of them on pservers now- but they will not be the majority.  Most players don't even *discuss* this, but it doesn't mean that the community has somehow transcended the need for loot.
---
If anything it would affect the Retail Economy if Retail players really enjoy classic they might bleed their retail gold away to buy subs and focus all their time on classic rather than retail which would actually be good.
---
Blizzard have been actively trying to reduce the gold in retail for years, so it might kill two birds with one stone.
---
that escalated quickly
---
What about "vanilla blizzlike" ? Because in vanilla people were buying gold. I know because we had new players on goldbuying runs spending 2000g on T2 pants in MC. Guilds fully took advantage of others buying gold, nobody cared where they got the gold in the first place.
---
 &lt;**UNITY**\&gt; - OCEANIC (PVP) Semi-Hardcore

**Alliance faction**

We are based in Australia (Sydney/Melb). We will be taking time off work at launch after then returning to work playing on a 6pm-12pmish schedule while trying to keep a balance of life. 
---
Weekends times are all day if possible. We are mostly 30+ but we have a few younger members joining us as well.   Priority is raiding and Dungeons. PVP is secondary but still promoted. 
---
We will be using EPGP as our loot distribution system (Not fully set it stone yet) and we will not be letting anyone just over-ride gear calls except to the main tank or unless there is some serious reason to otherwise.  Anyone can apply - more the merrier just PM me on reddit and I can send you the discord info. This includes those outside of Australia who play in the same time zone. Feel free to bring in friends we don't have a limit on numbers.   
---
Rules:  Standard non-Harassment rules. 
---
Clever, numbers don't lie! 
---
&gt;  Yes, enchancement shaman in vanilla didn't do "gud dps". The point was that they were there to buff the others  
---
Which they can do as resto.  If you're talking about optimal raid comps, the ideal number of enhancement is zero.
---
It's legit absurd to have only 3 rogues in there.
---
&gt; Making the Enhance shaman the designated nightfall-axe guy  
---
If you need nightfall, why do you want enhance to do that?
---
Honestly, it's shocking that everyone forgets this.  Many top guilds were composed of players that geared up in a guild that stacked gear onto them, and then they used that gear to go into a better guild.  The top guilds at the end of vanilla were composed of the efforts of way more than just the members of those guilds- they were composed of the efforts of the guilds that had, in many cases , put loot onto someone who then ran away with it.  
---
If gear drops at the same rate it does in vanilla, you either need to plan to make *effective* use of that loot, or you need to plan to poach heavily from other guilds- in which case, if you aren't the biggest fish, you'll have made a guild of poachable dudes.
---
i avoid ganking lowbie trolls because i respect they arent tryin to min max
---
i kill on sight /every/ undead player i see though.  
---
trolls just look cool haha
---
no rogues lawl
---
So, I'm going to be rolling a warrior leveling as a duo with my buddy (priest).   
---
This means I want an alt to play when he's not online, thing is Im not sure what class that alt should be.   Thing I would like from my alt (not expecting to be able to achieve all of these); farming, self reliance, healing. 
---
Awesome buddy, I hope more will continue sharing the word :)
---
I’ve been actively sharing my hype for the upcoming release and know for sure that some of who I’ve spoken to about it will join as well and discover the game and hopefully enjoy that thrill I had when I discovered the game !
---
Looking forward to that ! (And to kill them as an enhancement shaman when they discover that their mage is a one shot to me mouahaha)
---
TLDR: My evil plan in action.
---
I dont get why ppl see right click report feature as the BAD thing. If someone is breaking the rules, reporting him should be easy to make the game better for everyone else, right ? Now its only seen as way to harass someone.
---
Put the report feature in there and have support figure out the stuff manually. In vanilla reporting a player is so damn hard that people fuck around because they know almost nobody will bother to report them. Is that better ?
---
I will quote a legendary story where find treasure racial shines:
---
&gt; I dueled this Dwarf Warrior in fresh level 60 gear, then suddenly he feared me and ran off to loot a chest he found. Then he came running back and one-shotted me with the Ashbringer he just looted from the chest. -   
---
\-some random wow player
---
Imagine discovering fakecasting in 2019.
---
Haha exactly. I don't want to go to the dark side
---
On my shadow priest if I saw a flagged enemy on a flying mount with 50% health or less I'd jump off my mount near an airborne enemy and hit them with instant-cast SWP, VT and PW:D on the way down before levitating to safety. If they panicked and flew up they could die out of rez range of the ground, which stopped them zerging back to contest world PvP objectives.
---
In theory gank squads of three or four shadow priests should have been able to kill just about anyone that way, but it never seemed to be a thing.
---
Hypothetically it's huge. Like 2-shotting ungeared people huge, really unfair pvp advantage. Mage scales incredibly well in end-game and with T3 gear level you'll definitely blow up most players with a round of instant spells without casting anything.
---
Now realistically it's a different story.
---
How likely are you to meet ungeared people that late into the game? Back in 2006, very likely. Today, I imagine about 75-90% of the player base do not raid outside of LFR. These players are the most likely to drop out during the leveling or during the process of gathering pre-raid BiS because of the lack of LFG assistance or tokens. Only a minority of casual players without a guild will stick to Classic and an even smaller minority will attempt to do PUG raids after some time (MC/Ony/ZG). These players have little to no incentive to continue playing Classic after the leveling journey and thus will probably be back to retail LFG/LFR by the time BWL comes out, let alone Naxx possibly years after release.
---
And how likely are you to get Naxx gear yourself, or even play that late into the game? Back in 2006, WoW was the best MMO around and we were all looking forward to the future of this franchise. In today's standards, I'm afraid most people will find out that vanilla was mediocre at best. How many raiders will stick around for this piss easy raid content compared to retail? For how long can we realistically assume that people will log in on a reset night, clear 2 to 4 numbingly boring raids in a single evening, then log off for the rest of the week? What is the state of Classic going to be that far after the summer when they finally release significant raid content with AQ and Naxx stages? Impossible to tell.
---
I checked some of the SI:7 background and does indeed look like they have several dwarf assassins, one of them was even the leader of an assassination squad. Reminds me of the witcher 2 story, assassin of kings, where there was a dwarf looking main villain who killed rulers.
---
Here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCXw8m0PHI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCXw8m0PHI)
---
damn kids, wow was great until they released vanilla and ruined it
---
&gt; How good of a gear level would everyone else have at that point after naxx is released?
---
Impossible to say.
---
I was on a total failserver pre-TBC. The most advanced Horde guild barely got Rag down before TBC launched, and they couldn't even do the first boss of BWL. I think one Alliance guild was in BWL but couldn't do AQ.
---
So if you were the only Naxx guild in a server that was otherwise total fail, you could be in T3 while most people didn't have a single purple.
---
My guess is that outside premades, scrubs in blues will always outnumber MC raiders, who will outnumber BWL/AQ raiders, who will outnumber Naxx raiders. If you're in full T3 you should have a big gear advantage over most people you see.
---
A good rogue is great in 1v1. A great rogue is great in 1v1 + a Teamplayer. By CC'ing healers behind enemy lines for example.
---
It will all been down to your raid leader then or the core raid leadership and guild leadership.
---
I would say a guild shouldn't allow just other raiders to give someone shit. The person that speaks to that raider is their class/role lead and the raid leader etc. If there are issues such as training etc.
---
A modern one is classicast
---
paladin in wotlk was the best thing i ever played in my life. overall wotlk is my favorite game. i spend so much time with it. i just got destroyed when at the end of wotlk they change the skill trees and introduced holy power (i guess that was the name). after that it just wasnt the same anymore. i quit with tears in my eyes.
---
Yes exactly, like OP's brother a lot of people just want to see how it was like back then, completely different game
---
Abuses engineering, consumables. Knows how to manage energy.
---
Part of my issue is the lack of information about if anything has changed. I understand they want to do some quality of life improvements eg how mail worked.
---
A release date would really help with people planning leave and getting everyone on the bandwagon. We don't know how far they have things working but the Demo after Blizzcon was fantastic to see.
---
I don't think the game will fail, I just think some news could help.  PServers have been great for testing the basics but they are not a 100% mirror of the original. Hopefully classic gets as close to the original as possible.  
---
Mage or hunter for the two first criterias. No healing class is really good at farming but the most self reliant of them has to be a shadowpriest since you can easily heal dungeons while leveling. Holy priests can farm DM:e though.
---
Then you and I are in the same position and i think your way of thinking is awesome. Maybe getting yelled at is inevitable, but how we react to these moments is vital. Never give up! 
---
Countdown to Classic is the best one around.  I also listen to The Classic Casual. 
---
That's very sad when profit is above the experience of people lol. I hope anyone that multiboxes (especially in BGs) will get a visit from karma.
---
No it really isn't. I'm in a very casual guild on a pserver atm, we raid 2x a week, started with 1x week just clearing MC and now 2x when we moved into BWL. People are casual and we clear MC in like 2 hours and onyxia is another 30 - 45 min. We then do progression raids in BWL for 3.5 hours.
---
Sprinkle some random ZG and AQ20 in there but they aren't mandatory.
---
Cast hearthstone, if no kick then you win cause you hsed out of combat.
---
Excuse me, what Fallout 3 trains? It's been a while, but I honestly can't recall a single **moving** train in that game?
---
You never have enough shamans as horde... so like 100% guaranteed raidspot = roll a resto shaman.
---
This sub in a nutshell bro
---
"PSA: TIL If you move/jump/press esc during a cast you can bait an interrupt and then you'll be free to heal!"
---
And we saw only darkness after him :(
---
If you are good you won't be yelled at. And if you are, the rest of the group will defend you and might even kick the yeller because chances are he's the baddie
---
It's in one of the dlc:s. Can't recall which one though.
---
Positioning, clever usage of cooldowns, and energy pooling
---
Not being a viable dps for top guilds. As a 12year+ elemental shaman main it hurts.
---
UBRS last spot - key required!
---
Was really trying to get into this one... he spent the whole first episode going through potential changes and how they could be positive. Stopped right there.
---
I would really like a 100% blizzlike vanilla experience, and it sounds like he is coming from a different perspective.
---
Not to mention i felt like I was in the car listening to ABC radio... just waiting for him to introduce the weekend woodies &gt;.&lt;
---
You shouldn't be worried about all this. All the hardcore will tell you how big the difference is, but in the other end, if you are a good player or normal one, among an ocean of normal non hardcore players, it won't matter at all.
---
Just play what you like. Before a minmax job, Classic is a game with huge aesthetics involved. Don't get influenced. Most people won't care.
---
Now if you want to go 1st of server, of want to be one of the first r14 of your server, then I've nothing to say.
---
And that Scarlet patrol, dont forget about them!
---
4 hunters？
---
They can't really make a raid full of meme spec gear though, like why would guilds run it? To gear their 1-2 meme spec players?
---
I would try to gank him in such a way that the last hit was done by the boss so he would get durability loss. Too bad he'll probably Feing Death unless he's really terrible.
---
I'd probably just slow/fear him into mobs and watch it unfold.
---
Warcraft 2 and Diablo were two of my first and holy cow do both of them stand the test of time. Warcraft 2 map editor was revolutionary.
---
Im not sure when they changed these to be 5 man, but i loved those mini raids when they were still 10 man :)
---
Nobody yells at a dwarf priest
---
You left out the hours trying to assemble a group there :P
---
I will multibox a team of Warrior, Priest, Mage, Warlock, “Rogue/Druid/Paladin/Shaman” (haven’t decided on faction yet lol). And yes, it is a TON of fun!

 **&lt;No Plan Required&gt;** is an EU Alliance guild that intends to roll on a PvP server. If you're looking for a relaxed raiding environment with a pinch of competition involved, or a social enclave to hide from your severe depression, then you've hit the jackpot.  
---
The main idea of the guild is to create a community where casual players and hardcore players can co-exist and succeed - but the utmost importance is that we all have fun doing it. 
---
Talk to us on Discord! [https://discord.gg/pgW5Dz](https://discord.gg/pgW5Dz)
---
You're pretty much mirroring my thinking so far. Do you know how much worse holy nova farming in DM:e would be compared to a mage?   
---
Another thing I thought about, don't mages need to respecc a LOT, with PvE, PvP and farming all needing different speccs?
---
Bunnies are everywhere.  The archers on the bridge leading to Sunwell are firing at bunnies.  You will see them all over the place on badly coded private servers, usually they take on the model of an infernal because that's the first model that got put in.  Pretty funny to see archers firing at tiny infernals which are called bunnies
---
If you play with random people there's always a chance you'll be yelled at for no good reason. Healers get yelled at a lot by people that don't know what they're doing - so they just assume it's the healer fault.   
---
In raids (assuming to are in a decent guild) healer will only be yelled at if they need to be yelled at, in my experience. 
---
**&lt;Wanderlust&gt; [Alliance] EU-PvE Server | English language**
---
**Our Philosophy:**
---
No rush, no guides. Let's play the game and learn it that way. Many of our members are new to Vanilla or at least to Vanilla raiding. We would like to experience the game to the fullest by going in "blind" and taking our time. (This should be taken as "first few times", for fun and flavor. We are not overzealous.) Veterans are of course welcome if they are fine with the style. There are already members with extensive WoW experience. We know this will take a lot of time but we are fine with it.
---
Progression. Although we should be relaxed and not rush anywhere, we should progress through all content eventually. Wipes on first tries of raids are completely expected but eventually we should learn them and clear them efficiently for progressing to the next one. The same goes for characters. We should be somewhat relaxed, not demanding the utmost in min/maxed builds. But just goofing off with "joke" builds shouldn't be our style either. Anything which works reliably for progression will be fine but no less.
---
**Who are we looking for:**
---
Anyone wishing to experience the whole game in a relaxed but mature atmosphere and who is prepared to take it slow with us. Focus is on raiding reliably, which means that people should show up and perform sufficiently. You don't need to know know stuff or be good at the game now, just be willing to improve and get good enough for raiding. Gear distribution will favor reliable progression. We should also be able to help each other in every facet of the game but apart from raiding, everything is optional. 
---
**Raiding related information:**
---
* We'll start raiding at least 6 month from release. You can use the time as you see fit, leveling slowly or leveling more than one character.
---
* Raid times are up for discussion still but I expect two raids on weekdays. (Most likely around 19-23 CET)
---
* Loot council (most likely).
---
Anyone interested, message me!
---
I hope blizz doesn’t go fun police mode and stop us from going there.
---
there are many QoL which, each on its own, is a fine addition, but if you add them all together you end up with modern wow
---
a bumpy road is a more memorable experience than a flat road
---
My biggest concern is that after a year or so (assuming they'll release Naxx right at the start or soon after the start) there will be a part of population runnig around battlegrounds and arenas in full Naxx/AQ40 gear. This will almost everybody else practically unable to compete against them.
---
If Classic is here to stay, I wonder how will the endgame PvP look like.
---
\+1 i'm new and i'm comming (: 
---
Agreed. I am under 18 years old and I'm super excited to discover what most players call "the golden age of WoW". We mustn't forget that this game is 14 years old, therefore a lot of Classic players won't be here for pure nostalgia o/ 
---
Oh yeah, I watched his videos. They're super helpful even for a noob like me. Everything is also documented in a google doc which is in the Video description. So I can quickly peak into it. A super nice and knowledgeable guy.
---
Hello, i'm not the best but definitely not a noob :), I can hold my own against the best of each class. Do you have a char on Retro? Lets duel. And if you don't you can make one and we can do it with starter gear :) maybe you can teach me something.
---
You cannot reroll your race. I'd say it's better to pick a good race in case you'll regret it later.
---
I see no reason that would happen.

My favorites are Countdown to Classic, PvP workshop seriers and Good morning Azeroth series by Kargoz

You should have no problems finding leatherworkers who can make it. It's one of the better ways to make money early on in a server. 
---
Those people definitely existed in 2005. The thing is if someone ninja looted domo's chest or stole from the guild bank everyone on the server found out about it and the shitty people were basically ostracized by the server. People would say "Soulreaper? isn't that the rogue who stole from his guild bank? yeah no thanks I'll invite someone else"
---
What I really mean is that the support in WoW didn't seem heavy enough, and I'd like to see an MMORPG where it's much more.  Enhancement and Elemental Shaman was a lot nicer for support in TBC, that's for sure, but it felt like the devs were too scared to shift more of its DPS away into support abilities.  But anyway, now we're just talking in theoreticals, as fun as that is, lol.
---
And yeah, I don't doubt playing Support can be fun for people.  Once in a while, it appeals to me too.  I just always want it to be something that's a very helpful thing and has gameplay behind it, which is why Bard in Rift was so neat to me: Almost every attack did minor healing or some buff or debuff.
---
Generally speaking everything that only requires gold is easy to get, though it may take some tedious gold farming to get it. 
---
I hope so, I love your videos btw
---
Going off private server data the devilsaur set will cost you about 200-300g. The leather itself is pretty hard to farm solo as it comes from tough elites that are farmed by both factions.
---
Personally I would save up gold and just straight up buy it. Often there are several up on the AH and you can make a pretty decent deal if you watch the market. I bought my set for about 220g if I remember correctly.

Yes the t2, t1, t3 are references to access of gear not actual gear they will be wearing

**Epoch of Thought [H]** | NA-PvP | Wed, Thur, Sun 1800—2200 PST | Hardcore 
---
**About**: EoT started on Bloodscalp shortly after vanilla wow’s release &amp; became a top guild on the server. We’ve persisted as a gaming family ever since. Our goal has always been to clear content as a team while providing a second family for our members.  
---
For classic we will be a top guild &amp; clear Naxxramas. We have a solid core experienced through Naxx. Most of us have raided for years &amp; are ready to devour classic content. We run a DKP-guided loot council focused on awarding gear where it best serves raid progression &amp; best recognizes attendance, &amp; contribution to raid performance.
---
**What we expect**: We expect dedicated, skilled raiders who show up with consumes, proper gear, &amp; knowledge. We are team-focused so great performers are appreciated &amp; recognized, but divas who are unconcerned with the health of the entire raid team or overly self-interested are not tolerated. We are a diverse group of raiders worthy of individual respect &amp; the respect of everyone’s time.  
---
In short, be prepared, be knowledgeable, be on time, &amp; don’t be an A-hole.
---
**Raid Schedule**: Wed, Thur, Sun, 6 PM to 10 PM PST (GMT-8) (9pm – 1 AM EST) hard stops. Our guild has always been extremely active &amp; 20-mans, Onyxia, etc. will continue to be ran on non-core days. On most days, if you log in, you will find a good group of people to smash content with.
---
**Looking for**: Great people of all classes are strongly encouraged to apply; **specifically seeking: Shamans &amp; Resto Druids.** Core raid spots are earned through demonstrated competence &amp; dedication. If you are interested in leadership roles within the guild please send me a whisper &amp; let’s chat.
---
**Apply**: The best way to join is to shoot me a private discord message (Discord: 
---
Lne#2710 | Battlenet: Lne#1326).  The less social can also fill out an application on our Website &lt;http://epochofthought.shivtr.com&gt;  You can also jump on our discord at &lt;https://discord.gg/UqAVjJT&gt;

&gt;The reagent granted meaning to a buff you gave to someone else.  Removing it turned it into just another button.
---
As a priest, i can say the buff reagent cost was a non issue... The fact that group buff took \~50% of your mana pool WAS a issue. Lets say you used your free cast cd on one group, 2nd and 3rd group meant sitting drinking for 1 minute straight.
---
Considering the potential for how bad sharding can be and how game breaking loot sharing is. It's not vanilla wow anymore. Ruined? thats a bit of a stretch but is it still vanilla wow with loot sharing and sharding? nope.  
---
Based on how wow is currently being run and what their current servers look like when you have multiple people on screen I think it's unlikely we'll see a drastic change to their infrastructure that will bring us back to the vanilla wow experience of seamless hundreds of players battling over hillsbrad foothills or kiting world bosses to major cities. No one knows for sure yet, but it's very possible that classic will be an inferior product because of Activision Blizzard interfering with the original game design to pinch pennies. 
---
If I were a betting man I would say that Activision will probably ruin classic wow and hopefully cause the creation of a nostalrius 2.0 that can be run by a handful of people from the Netherlands that have more love and respect for the game than the company that owns it.
---
No idea how good holy priests are at farming it, but some guildies say it's pretty chill.
---
I started farming DM:e with the standard build for it, but now in bwl i am AP Frost and i can farm DM:E just fine with that too. Pull them all with manashield, gather, nova, flamestrike + cone of cold, kite around in a circle spamming AE. It's not as clean and efficient but you will get locked out due to 5 resets per hour anyway so it's np. Only thing is you can't farm DM:N unless you have imp Blizzard.
---
Everyone pretty much has to respec for PvP afaik anyway so it's not exsclusive to mages.
---
And that comes with you might get people mad at you. Picks your choices and accept pros//cons
---
Human are not considered to be Min/Max top spec because of perception. They're because of Sword and Mace specialization. But that's mainly a PVE thing. However, PVP both the Dwarfs and the Gnomes are better.  
---
This. People are also a lot more willing to accept that some healers arent specced for it and need to drink more often, are new to it and need to take things slowly, etc. Dungeons are a team effort.
---
Maladath has +4 for swords as a sword itself, so it is usable by rogues despite appearing rather late (BWL, Broodlord). Even if we consider the whole content KT drops a +6 sword (Hungering Cold) but ofc we're talking about the very last boss vanilla-wise. Last, but far from optimal due to weapon speed (two 1.7 weapons, not a good deal)  is the ZG sword set whose bonus is +6 sword WS as well.  
---
A similar thing can be said early on with Distracting Dagger, a blue offhand DM drop with +6 dagger WS which may be an option if no better OH weapon is available. 
---
Raids should be less of a problem I'd day. Find a guild with a good group and a good raid leader who won't flip out or allow other people to do it. If it's an awful environment, what's the point in raiding?
---
If there are 2 mages with the same skill level, the one with the best gear will win. That's a fact.  
---
Remember skill &gt; build &gt; gear  
---
That means don't go full arcane expecting to fuck people up with missiles only because you have t3
---
WoW tokens are a show stopper for me - I won't be participating in anything that resembles P2W, period. If trhere is any way to give the game company money which results in in-game advantages, no matter how small then I wion't be playing.
---
RCR as it exists in retail is also a show stopper. Any system where groups of players can conspire to abuse a game mechanic to affect another player's game is something that I can't support at all.
---
Sharding isn't that big of a deal, especially 1-20 which is mostly a shit-show of players trying to level. I don't really care if I see some particular random dwarf or not - if anything it will make farming Peacebloom easier for me. If they shard past 20 or so,then I will think about not playing.
---
Cash shop for pets (I think) was around in retail vanilla. Anything else such as mounts might be a problem, especially if people do things with those mounts to be annoying (which probably will be the case.)thing like the commemorative Blizzcon pet is kind of a cool tribute to people who actually attended in person. Simply "attending" on your computer at home is not cool &amp; not a reason for people to have a rare pet.
---
Then they need to have thick skin and tolerate being yelled when they inevitably mess up. People don't particularly want to play with people who don't know what they're doing and cause wipes because they are constantly messing up. I think it's great if people want to learn the game by playing the game, but don't expect everyone to be super tolerant of of all the mistakes. At the end of the day, it's not only wasting your time, but also the time of everyone else in the group.
---
STV is legit my favorite leveling zone in the game, and I never play on anything but a PvP server. PvE STV would be a gimped shadow of its true glory.

**&lt;Pertento&gt;**
---
**EU [RP-PvP] | Alliance**
---
**Dedicated PvE with a social atmosphere**
---
**Guild Information:** At Pertento, we emphasize the social and altruistic aspect of vanilla gaming. We believe raiding should be fun and engaging and not a mindless chore. As a result, we have tried to circumvent the currently prevalent min-max culture by making room for viable specs that are considered unoptimal and feeble by many. Ultimately, we value social cohesion and respect among our members which will ensure our perseverance, and eventually our success, in even the most strenuous PvE encounters.
---
**What we expect from our members:** At the same time, we are a dedicated raiding guild which means that our expectations of raiders are high. Like any ‘semi-hardcore’ guild we expect all players attending raids to be fully prepared, including those that are playing an ‘off-spec’. Members must also acknowledge that the freedom we provide players depends entirely on the difficulty of the content, and as such, if progression is too slow, we will take the necessary steps to get more optimal raid setups. Depending on the circumstances, we may also try to vie for server firsts, as we ultimately strive to be on a competitive level with other dedicated raiding guilds.

&gt;liberalisation
---
Is that even a word?
---
The act of giving $$ to a company is a very capitalist idea.
---
With the benefit of hindsight, it was the worst expansion because it introduced all the garbage that stopped the game being good.
---
Super easy difficulty, AoE spam dungeons, LFG etc
---
Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it at the time but looking back it was the death of the Classic gameplay and systems.
---
Hey man I'm 26 and only just started so I'm super keen to jump into it.

[deleted]
---
As s former Naxx-raider: A full naxx geared char is almost impossible and if you manage it then I think you are beyond normal pvp or use hyper maxed out pvp gear.
---
Wonder what difference does it actually make in the end.
---
With SND MH speed should be &lt;2 sec always with slowest possible MH 2.8 speed.
---
Mashing SS would make it random at which point it lands between auto attacks so it would be right in the middle at average of 1 second.
---
So ~25% of MH attacks (FOR HORDE) would be delayed by 50% = 12.5% (1/8) MH white DPS loss.
---
Assuming white damage is 50% of total damage, thus something like 37.5% of DPS is MH damage.
---
1/8 of 37.5 would be like 4.6%.
---
I think it would be fair to say that at worst someone might lose out on ~5% DPS, however that would be with perfect timing. With average timing, something like, doing SS 0.5sec after swing would drop DPS gain in half.
---
So, somewhat a DPS boost FOR HORDE but to be honest comparing individual, quick, boss fights you would not even be able to spot which rogue does watch swings and which does not.
---
For alliance that would be like &lt;1% dps gain, pretty much irrelevant.

In a way you'll have a harder time in Classic. The mentality is about the same (from what I've experienced on private servers) but they can't replace you as easily as they would in BfA so if you mess up a lot you should be prepared for a lot of abuse. 
---
It was in the beta not the live game.  As in a very minuscule amount of people witnessed it.  And even still, they wouldn’t make classic off a damn beta version of the game that never went live.  Do you know what live means you fucking moron? 
---
Thanks! My guess is that they'd only ban movement that benefits you, like running along mountainsides to cut between zones... but, I think that was always the case *technically*, though I've never heard of it being enforced. If they use right-click reporting/loot trading as expected, it signals there will be fewer GMs overall, and I'm guessing they'll be too busy with serious issues to deal with people sight-seeing or even using terrain to skip between zones.
---
Awful idea. No changes.
---
Ive no idea if those were the means that gold farmers used, however there were a lot of gold sellers. 
---
They would hack the game and write URLs to their website in corpses floating in the middle of stormwind lol. 
---
If they couldn't hack, they'd just do it on the floor. 
---
You'd always see them spamming in trade chat too.
---
TLDR; LOTS OF GOLD SELLERS
---
That first comment is gold.
---
That’s a horrible idea 
---
My question was if vanilla had same thing happening

**The Philosophy**
---
We're a guild consisting of three friends with experience from the private server hardcore community, and have participated in speedruns and realm firsts in various raids. However we haven't been active in that community for a while now and instead turned our attention towards planning our own guild when the official servers arrive.
---
We're planning to be a top-tier raiding guild, and hopefully realm first, throughout all of Classic content. We already have a lot of preparation done, and are currently on the state where we only need to recruit people.
---
**What we expect of you**
---
We have some fairly high demands for those of you who are interested in joining our guild, but deem this necessary as our expectations are high. However if you don't have any experience, don't let this scare you away, we feel confident that the leadership and class leaders will be able to help you out. However we do expect you to put the time and dedication in the game needed to participate in this level of gameplay.

---
That's not how the maths works, 3% crit isn't the same as 3% increased threat.
---
Seems kinda selfish to ruin the enjoyment others get out of learning the fight through doing it by insisting they watch a guide because you don't actually want to play the game and just want the loot at the end. 
---
Another way to look at it, check out tipsout’s videos ranking dps in raid tiers. Let’s look at mages. MC average DPS 362, Naxx average DPS around 1,000 (rounded down to control for rolling ignites). 
---
Be conservative and say it’s just over a 2x damage increase. Meanwhile your health has increased around the same (source = ?) due to more stam on gear.
---
So roughly 200% DPS advantage x 200% health advantage = 400% better in Naxx gear vs MC.
---
Obvious caveats around raid buffs etc aside, but it’s huge. 
---
If it's anything like PServers, most people PvPing regularly will have similar raid gear, so you won't have that much advantage.
---
If it's like it was in 2006 then you'll destroy a lot of people.
---
Here's an anecdote from an AV in 2006 to illustrate:
---
I'm an alliance Warlock defending SP, there's loads of alliance and horde here. I'm up on the hill behind the flag and some mage hits me with a frostbolt, it does about 600 dmg. Immediately, I can tell he has shit for gear because my shadow bolts do over 900, so I'm thinking I can 1 shot this guy for the lols. So I wind up a Soulfire while he's spamming frostbolt at me. He gets about 4 casts in, pushing my spell back a lot but I've got the HP to tank it. Eventually, Soulfire goes off, crits for like 3.4K and 1 shots him.
---
Now I had MC/Ony/ZG/PvP gear. 4.5k Hp, 321 Spell Power. So nothing special. I don't know what he had but he must've had close to 0 Spell Power.
---
This example should also illustrate how bad we both were. Since he didn't counterspell me and I just stood there soaking his frostbolts and nobody else interfered in the fight.
---
I know exactly what u mean, this happend to me too just 1 week ago. The server does always have 5k to 9k on, so when classic is out it will be way better. If blizzard decide on 3k servers there still might be a 60 on some of the spots during peak hours. However at night etc, u can do this eaisly with just a few hundred on because its regional based. Hope that helps 
---
I saw the crit/hitratings and was about to adjust for vanilla values but then 1) It would not be a direct quote anymore 2) we weren't talking about crit/hit but of Stamina. I was just answering your claim that "WL t1 have more stam than t3". FYI, I'm not downvoting.
---
Or 7 warriors and a druid :P
---
DPS nukes mob that is immune to taunt before the tank has even gotten a single hit on it, now the mob is running in the raid cleaving everything. Congratulations hunter who didn't feign, rogue who didn't vanish and warrior who's just retarded, you wiped the raid by getting aggro before the tank, dying, and now the healers have healing aggro and the tank is trying to catch up with threat but it's already too late. It happens a LOT. 
---
Blessing of Salvation dear :P
---
Ye, just in few cases blizzard change items stats on certain items, so if you see any rating thing you need to check stats twice. 
---
Haha just saying bud, predicting Blind is a tool you def need to have to qualify as “good” as a Druid. That’s all. Good videos that showcase the skill (pretty easy skill, actually, Abolish has a pretty long duration especially given how easily predictive Blind is) are the Stormx series, and Finarufurashu (Finalflash). 
---
I’m also a resto Druid player and it took me a bit to finesse this one. Especially as a flag carrier it’s incredibly important in Vanilla. 
---
EA suffers from how spammable are some slows and roots. You can avoid one? Next is applied immediately. 
---
This goes for warriors (hamstring spam if melee range and howl), mages (r1FB spam and so many other spells, ofc), shamans (frost shock+earthbind, you won't stop both), rogues (crippling if melee range), hunters (depending on spec, but wing clip, frost trap, counterattack, concussive... and even if you do a successful EA there's a potential freezing trap or scatter to reset and apply them again) and even priests (mind flay if shadow, holy has no such effects). 
---
It is only strong vs locks (if SM-Ruin, amplified CoEx being the only strong slow, basic CoEx is still there, tho, being spammable) and druids to an extent (it is useful against NGrasp, but roots are still spammable so by the time you break out you may be rooted again unless you react fast enough and he doesn't use NS to make it instant cast). 
---
No
---
Sounds like someone is salty about getting camped :)
---
&gt; In PvP, **dwarves** and gnomes have the edge over **dwarves** 
---
;)  Humans are so behind that they run away while stealthed... leaving only dwarves and gnomes here. 
---
Anyway you are just right. Just pointing out a funny mistake and trolling a bit. 
---
I vaguely remember level 60s killing my earlier level quest mobs. IIRC I whisper one and asked them if they minded if I killed just 10. The other player said sure and they needed a break anyway. So that was nice of them. I feel like being polite can go a long way in this game, but of course it will not work for everyone.
---
Also just because someone is mindlessly killing mobs, it does not make them a bot or mean they a "Chinese gold farmer."
---
I don't think that farming elemental earth is more profitable than farming dungeons. 
---
Show me where the bad warlock touched you....
---
Really? On all the servers I played on it was IF all the way. Started with the only AH and never really changed. 
---
I think you're thinking about the wrong game. 
---
If I remember correctly, the reason those elementals are farmed so much is because they have the best drop ratio of Elemental Earth, and that's an ingredient for Nature Protection Potions, and *those* are needed for AQ.
---
&gt;  That would solve some of these issues
---
...And introduce new ones, because you aren't solving the problem, you're just putting it somewhere where it does not affect you *yet*.
---
Seriously, how long have you been thinking about a suggestion such as "just let mobs 10+ levels below you not drop anything any more"? Because I've thought about for ten seconds now, and I can see a myriad problems being introduced that way, but not one single problem actually *solved*. Just goes to show that being salty probably isn't conducive to problem solving.
---
"Vanilla WoW won't fail, it's not nostalgia. They better release expansions doe or else it'll fail."
---
I like this philosophy 
---
It was but more shady, ppl was scary to get banned for buyin gold. 
---
I did these quests yesterday. I just asked a 60 if i could join them.  Id keep the quest item and thet could have all the rezt.  Worked great
---
Thanks. Edited!
---
I will make my own devilsaur set as a rogue. Why do people not think the AH will be full of them? 
---
The only time I killed magni, we snuck an entire raid into old IF by going to the airport and slow falling down to it or something. Then we used an air spell or hunters pet to pull him into old IF while no one could do anything about it. 
---
You’re 8 months behind the curve on a fast progression mega-pop private server. Not a good experiential basis for making design changes. 
---
I don't know, I enjoyed playing with black furred Tauren druid Milkomx.
---
It didnt, i had a gnomish death ray on my lvl 40 paladin and Bubble-HoJ-Death Ray was my go to move, i definitely remember not taking any damage with bubble up. This being sometime before ZG atleast.
---
It's strange how this sub constantly pushes flying mount TBC and lfg WotLK.
---
I would farm the gold and buy the gear. After the Epic mount, buying BOE items is where my gold is going next. A few hours of gold farming to buy items is much preferable to me than the frustration of instance runs with low % drops (and then probably losing the roll to a hunter anyway). Where possible filling a few key gear slots with purchased gear makes sense.
---
Except that’s not how selfish works. One person ruining 4+ players experience for their own is selfish. 4+ players being and at 1 for doing so is not. 
---
I used to farm devilsaur's solo with my druid in retail. Maybe you can find a druid guildie to help you get all the leather you need. Its an easily two-man mob
---
I know what abolish poison is, if you had taken 2 seconds to watch my other video where I dueled a skilled t3 rogue (who also is a streamer) you would have seen that I use it. In this duel the rogue obviously had no chance so I was just messing with him with moonfire spams. Don't want to throw anyone under the buss so no names but I frequently duel "famous" youtubers on retro and do very well against them. But thanks for the input.
---
How does it come nobody stated the most important point? The name! If your rogue isn't called Shadowhunter, -killer, Night-something or similiar you will have a bad time.
---
Also your own PvP-video with a b/w intro set to Linkin Park is a must have!

**&lt;Requiem&gt; - Horde | NA-PvP | Semi-Hardcore**
---
**Intro:** We are a group of friends from the mid-west all jumping back in for Classic. Most are classically trained up to and including MC, ONY, and BWL, with a few who saw AQ40 and NAXX content prior to the release of BC. Many in this group, myself included, have been active across various private servers over the years and are eager to bring our knowledge and experience to the Blizzard stage.
---
*First and foremost, this will be a Semi-Hardcore Progression/Raiding Guild.* Our goal is to progress through all Raid content efficiently but without tryharding and sacrificing the fun aspect of playing the game -others have referred to this as relaxed-progression.
---
Don't let this intimidate you, we understand we're all older now, with families and careers. We're not asking you to put in an extra 40 hours of WoW on top of real world responsibilities. We're also not asking you to give up PVP. And while we'd love to begin progressing through content as soon as possible we understand the level 60 grind, and preparing for raids, takes time and effort.
---
**What we're focusing on now:** Building a core group\* of like-minded players who understand the level of effort and coordination behind building a successful raiding guild and have the drive to make it happen in a friendly and laid-back, albeit efficient, environment.
---
*\*If you have past experience with being a raid/class leader (or even no experience at all) and are interested in applying for an officer position, PM me.*
---
**Expectations:** Be courteous and respectful of all members. No gatekeeping. We don't expect everyone to know strats to every encounter, but if you don't, we will expect that you show up with a positive attitude and a willingness to learn.
---
**Raid Schedule:** Thursday &amp; Sunday 6:00 PM PST. As more content becomes available we may add a 3rd day, this is still TBD.
---
Discord: [https://discord.gg/WkmxDEE](https://discord.gg/WkmxDEE)
---
Idk, when AQ40 opens elemental earth will be in high demand for the nature-resi potions, I made a lot of gold during that time by farming ee.
---
lol
---
I don't think you should base your class choice on this, but originally devilsaur was 80- 100g per piece on our server.  It was 100% not farmed out and it was pretty common to get stomped by wild devilsaur while leveling.  While people more realize more that the set is a very good DPS set, it still will probably not be tough to farm leather on a 2k pop server especially if you can play in off peak hours.
---
You're a healer, and that's probably going to be a big thing. Not many people will want to heal or tank, though a bit more will be willing to heal than tank...  
---
But whatever you do, if people begin yelling at you, you have the right to say "Okay, I'm done, no more healing for you guys." and leave the gorup....find another one.  
---
You don't have to deal with jerks, there's no looking for group in the game, so I'm sure in Classic they will be more appreciative of you investing your time into a group content....and if they are not, they can feel free to find another healer. If you really need to finish that dungeon too? Well....you make your choice...either you are willing to wait and find a better group, convince them to behave, or just suffer through it with them....up to you.
---
yeah, I can't put my finger on what went wrong in my perception, but I didn't like it, and haven't liked it since (and I've tried)
---
To some degree it also hinders cross-faction collusion, that's very important for the true vanilla feeling imo.
---
And a good spriest can heal all the lvl 60 5-mans (as well as UBRS if they know what they are doing and have another true healer in the group).
---
I said that it won't fail if they don't release TBC. TBC could potentially harm Classic's playerbase too much assuming Classic would even stay available. I'm not sure where you got the "They better release expansions doe or else it'll fail" part.
---
...was TBC expansion invalidating the months and years of playing and grinding you and your guild had done. So everyone was pissed, guilds broke up, long term friendships ended...
---
TIL that song is from a musical. I've always thought someone created it for this video.
---
MC was not open at launch.
---
I see this misinformation being spread around pserver discords too.
---
You do pickpocket runs for 4-5 hours and then you buy the devilsaur set on the AH. That’s how you get it. 
---
Go for it. Animations and looks are vastly superior to some dumb passive.
---
If you plan on going hardcore I think your biggest problem will be your own faction. Try hards might excommunicate you from premade bgs but if you're ok with making/finding a relaxed PvP group absolutely go for it.
---
Friend of the Darkspear. I do this to a lesser extent with Non-Priest Dwarves.

I agree. I find no enjoyment in rushing things like that. All games were more fun before internet guides and videos told everyone how they should play the game. It's fun to organically learn together and interact. Learning from mistakes, the reward for figuring it out yourself, etc. 
---
It's all ruined when someone with zero patience just wants to do what they want to do. That's selfish imo. 
---
madseasonshow is the ultimate wholesome youtubers imo. He likes to encourage discussion in his comments and does not beg for likes and so on.
---
"Like and subscribe" has become youtube's equivalent of "Thoughts and prayers" and I almost never like a video if it has that phrase in it.
---
I agree, Full Naxx gear even put you ahead in BC it was so good. Not just Naxx had this kind of power though, Thunderfury was used by tanks even in Black Temple, it was so good.   
---
When you got upgrades in classic, you felt the power in pvp;
---
Try playing a dagger rogue in pvp with and without Predition's, Corehound Tooth, and Ancient Core Leather Gloves. You can have pre-raid BIS with just those 3 items from MC, and destroy in pvp.

---
Short reasoning for comp:
---
\- Enough tanks for all endgame content
---
\- All melee groups needs a shaman for windfury + agi twisting
---
\- All melee groups needs a mix of warrior shout and hunter aura or feral crit buff
---
\- I want a reasonable distribution of classes to avoid too much loot rotting
---
So the sum is:
---
2 PROT
---
6 Fury
---
6 Rogues
---
1 Feral Druid
---
3 Hunters
---
4 Warlocks 
---
6 Froest Mages
---
2 Restoration Druids
---
6 Restoration Shamans
---
4 Disc/Holy Priests
---
Total of:
---
2 Main Tanks
---
13 Melee dps
---
13 Ranged dps
---
12 Healers
---
Long reasoning for comp:
---
I prefer to have more than 1 resto druids because innervate is nice and buffing a whole raid alone is not fun. Furthermore 2 combat rezz is also quite nice, especially for progression runs. 
---
I try to mix melee groups in such a way that they gain as much attack power and/or melee crit as possible together with the availability of totem twisting windfury and agi totem.
---
I like the 3 hunters + 1 feral split in melee groups as feral crit aura covers well for the lack of trueshot aura. On top of it feral can opt in as an extra tank, plus an extra innervate and combat rezz. Furthermore feral get some pretty nice pieces for themselves that pretty much noone else wants, which makes the loot strain less on the rest of the raid. 
---
4 Warlocks might be too much i am not sure. if i were to replace a lock it would probably be with a shadow priest seeing as we will have 16 debuff slots, but then again i don't think it will matters that much. I want 3 minimum for the curses. 
---
In group 6 i placed 3 warlocks together. The idea here is to make it easy for the shaman and the resto druid to group heal the locks when they have to life tap and also to use threat reduction totem for the locks. I figure a druid would be nice in that group since druid hots have really nice healing per mana if they are allowed to run full duration, which should be easy to control with life tap. 
---
Group 7 and 8 are mirror setup with 3 frost mages and 2 disc/holy priests in each. Basically i just needed somewhere to stick the healers i had left and figured that would be fine. Drawback of this setup is i cannot provide totems for the mages. However mages are pretty well off with mana gem and evocation so i figured they would be the best candicades to go without a shaman group, furthermore they have less agro issues compared to warlock.
---
I figured the setup is pretty well-rounded and i was wondering what you guys think.
---
I would kill for someone to find me Wrath Era episodes of WoW Insider/Blizzard Watch.
---
I mean if you want to pick your choices and accept the pros and cons, likewise you should be ready to deal with people who aren't looking to rush content. To me it seems selfish to force people to move on before they're ready. 
---
Also just any remaining Original Vanilla podcasts would be great! Love this thread!
---
Roll dwarf priest. They will keep you no matter how badly you mess up.
---
I'm just coming down off a Hype High thanks mostly to a new job. Besides that I just try and occupy myself with other stuff that's coming out. Lately it's been New World, a survival/crafting mmo by amazon that has Souls esque combat. Super hype for that and just found a bunch of leaked gameplay online and stashed it before it got taken down.
---
Oh I have Icosial and MadSeasonShow subscribed so I can watch their videos as soon as I know about them.
---
I have heard legends of Saurfang ripping people asunder because he was made op.
---
This. Don't get me wrong, TBC was a good expansion but they should have never upped the level cap.
---
oh yeah I noticed he wrote warcraft 2 now, I've never played it so I can't comment on it. But the most recent archetype of paladins is from warcraft 3 which is what we got in wow, a defensive healer/tank
---
Except it’s not your choice lol. Trust me, if the people yelling at people not willing to use their resources had a choice to not be with them they would take it. 
---
Once they are in your group, the choice is how you react  after they mess up your run to which there aren’t many cons. What’s the worst that is going to happen? They leave and you don’t waste a kick? Lord forbid lol. 
---
Again, to me it seems selfish to crash ones birthday party than insist they are selfish for you asking you to leave. 
---
A few good things happened in legion:' 
---
* Mythic + by far the best addition to making dungeons challenging and exciting.  
---
* The raids were legitimately good, Tomb of Sargeras was quite cancer with soak mechanics.   
---
* new zones and world quests layout we're pretty good too.  
---
   
---
I can't recall much else but I enjoyed it for a good year.   
---
On a side note I absolutely loved discipline priest play style. All three suspects were actually really fun. But they may discipline priest so challenging and so rewarding. 
---
It wasn't the gear that broke my guild, it was the transition to 25 man's and multiple 10 man groups. All the drama caused by that made the core officers quit, wasn't worth it.
---
You really never need more than 3 shards while leveling. Once you complete quest for Voidwalker at lvl 10 you will get Soul Shard bag. All shards drained instantly go to Soul Shard bag unless it is full. Also always use rank 1 Drain Soul to lose less mana.
---
What else could they have done?
---
Perplexity is a great example. But as Isaelia already said in this post. "Engineering". 
---
If you don't have engineering as a rogue then prepare to get shit on by alot of classes that you would have been able to kill 1v1 with engineering. Rogue is one of the classes that can utilize engineering the most, seeing as they can reset combat multiple times so they can swap gear, where most others can't. 
---
Furthermore they have the benefit of chosing most of their fights 1v1 and when to engage which again means they can pick the engineering items that suits the task. 
---
I played alot of rogue back in vanilla and my personal experience says you will dominate in world pvp regardless of engineering or not due to stealth advangate and in duels you will have to rely alot on engineering if you don't outskill your oponent. In battlegrounds i feel rogue becomes really boring, really fast. One fearie fire or hunters mark or /pet attack and you get super frustrated. Also jumping the backline is really hard if they have anyone that just turns around and cc's you or blows you up, so it quickly becomes a 1 for 1 trade. Just my opinion. 
---
Things may look completely different in classic if they don't change spell batching, which they have not officially stated that they will or won't at this time. If you cannot vanish inbound spells and if you cannot gouge someone that blinked and all those insane moves that was possible on a rogue they will definately be weaker and looking how much you have to use your kit to beat a well geared and compotent player at high-end play 1v1 i feel that rogues would be pretty underwhelming in that regard. Then again i'm one of those rare people that absolutely hate World of Roguecraft video's because they pretty much just stated 2 things. 1 Eviscerate does great base damage with no gear and 2. people were shit at playing and somehow that made rogues OP in many peoples minds, which boggles me still today. 
---
Subscription yes, latest expansion no.
---
I honestly don't know why you're getting downvoted so hard. Obviously not everyone is gonna have aq40 gear, but certainly a lot of people including many casuals will. Lots of people seem to mix their 2005 expierence with what raiding will look like today. 
---
It's 100% your choice. And I'm sure those people would want to avoid you too if they could.
---
If your choice is to already be min/maxing content at level 10-20 or even pre 60 and are getting mad at people who are learning the game or aren't doing things as optimal, you are the selfish one. It's fair for you to help them, and guide them to doing the correct thing. It's not fair to assume everyone is required to research a game before playing it. It's also just not realistic.

Sidegrades/item sets with other unique effects/item sets that focus on certain abilities etc.

**&lt; Filthy Casuals &gt; \[A\] US-PVP**
---
 
---
Hey everyone! 
---
We are an alliance based guild that wants to remain relevant through the lifespan of WoW Classic. We are looking for players who want to focus on the community aspect of the game as well as clearing content. We are not a hardcore guild by any means. I would put us in the category of "Semi Casual". 
---
Our objective is simple it is to work together, clear content and get the hell out so people can have their own lives. We know that everyone is an adult now with responsibilities for the most part so we will NEVER keep anyone longer than official raid end. If we finish early we will encourage people to work on consumable farming or just hanging out with the guild but it wont be mandatory. 
---
Additionally since we are semi casual and not extremely hardcore we don't expect everyone to min / max and use every cookie cutter spec out there. We want you to have fun while raiding and not get burnt out. We will try our absolute best to allow people to change specs / change roles and still raid. With that being said, we still expect people to do their role in raids and help us clear as fast as possible so we can GTFO. 
---
Something I should have mentioned maybe is that all of our officers and most members so far have PLENTY of WoW Classic experience either private server or just remembering from 2004. 
---
**Raid Times (PST):** 
---
* Monday - Off
---
* Tuesday - Off
---
* Wednesday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Thursday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Friday - Casually 8PM - Whenever (What does this mean)
---
* Saturday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Sunday - Off
---
Our Friday raids will be official off nights. This is when we as a guild form up groups to do dungeons, pre-made BGs, or anything else the guild may need help with. Need to do a Paladin / Warlock Epic mount quest? This is your night. Need to farm materials for raids, but don't want to do it alone? This is your night. This is the night we go out of our way to help others in the guild and build relationships.
---
**Loot Rules:**
---
While we've looked into many other systems we have decided that we will be a DKP based guild. Randoming a raid of 40 people just isn't a fair system. Loot council can ultimately be made fair, but I don't want people to think officers or people placed on the loot council are bias against or for someone else. Also with 40 people, loot council is a beast lol. So we are just doing the simple DKP system. Points per boss kill, bid on the items you want, top bid wins the item. No going negative DKP unless you're the only one bidding on the item. We haven't decided if we want to make it an Open bid or closed bid system yet. But we will keep everyone updated. If closed bid system is chosen we will be using a discord bot to remain 100% transparent as leaders. 
---
**Membership:** 
---
There will be 6 Ranks in Filthy Casuals.
---
* Recruit - Recruits are exactly what they seem. They      will be on probation for 2 weeks and must make an effort into doing things      with the guild to become full members at the end of that two weeks. At the      end of the two weeks, the officers will decide to promote to extend      recruit status. Last priority on raid invites, and only can get loot that      is going to be DE'd.
---
* Alt - Duh
---
* Member - These people are fully functional members of      Filthy Casuals with no restrictions. If a member goes inactive for a      period of time we will just place a note on them in the guild tab and move      on. When they come back, its like they never left. 
---
* Raider - These are members who have put forth the      effort to raiding. These people require at least 75% Raid Attendance to      keep the rank of raider. That number may change later on we're not 100%      sure yet. Literally the only perk that Raiders have over member is they      are given priority on raid invites. This will benefit them more if we have      a full 40 members every raid. 
---
* Officer - Currently we have 5 officers and we plan to      keep it that way unless something unforeseen arises. We will get no      special treatment other than raid spots for our mains. We have all known      each other for 12+ years and want to ensure that the classic experience is      great for members of our guild. 
---
* GM - Me.. I don't do much, I just look pretty and      stream while my officers do things for me. I will be the final say in any      major decision but I do not run a dictatorship. I listen to EVERYONE and      will try to do my best at leading a bunch of filthy casuals. 
---
That's about it. If I missed anything, you have questions, concerns, or just what to chat it up feel free to send me a message on Reddit or join our discord below and we'll get your member role assigned.

They did give honor. Something like 4000 honor points with an "HK: Leader"
---
This was Wrath.
---
I would like to add to the comment made by /u/Obsido : You will 'get yelled at' at some point, regardless of your role. But if you play your role just fine, the only damage they will do by yelling is on your mood for the following 30 minutes and their reputation. If you build a reputation of a very good/flawless healer, they will only damage themselves even further. That kind of action/reaction is what makes the community of a game like Classic more mature than that of other games.
---
Again if it’s my choice and like you said pro cons, there aren’t any cons. The worst that happens is you leave and we get someone competent. 
---
It’s fair to watch a 5 minute video to not ruin the experience of 4 other players per group. You are the selfish one inherently. You are fighting for ones right to ruin a group while I am fighting for a groups right for a decent run AS A GROUP. One player doesn’t have the inherent right to ruin a group and if they want to they are going to get yelled at. Again, what’s the worst that’s going to happen? The one wiping the group will leave? Oh no, not that, anything but that. 
---
Tyvm
---
Know your class. Watch “world of roguecraft” for inspiration, still such a good video!
---
You get the soul shard bag when you get your succubus, not at level 10 (unfortunately). 
---
getting the same 40-43 people online consistently enough to make any progress
---
I couldn't wait and I bet it's delayed. Started in a private server
---
Private server have proved that the only way Blizzard can fail with Classic is if it's not vanilla.
---
yeah.. I mean the real problem is that the 'economy' is aware of the future need for ee.  During vanilla nobody had any idea they would be so needed so they just weren't farmed as much while most people were winding their way to 60 which made this a non-issue.
---
The gold farmers were always fun to grind near.  They would give you free stuff if you helped kill people ganking them.
---
It would be a "save Alexstrasza" type raid and it would have to be a Caverns of Time-type thing, since she was freed years before vanilla-- around the time period of Warcraft 2, actually. If you're the reading sort, you can read the story in the book *Day of the Dragon*.
---
The cons are you potentially waste more time looking for someone else, possibly disbanding the group if the person was a tank or healer, than just sticking the original person.
---
If the game does not recommend the video, why should anyone feel like it's required? Otherwise the player has all the reason to believe they're skilled enough to take on the content ahead of them. The game is literally designed to be learned by playing or the world and dungeon design would be irrelevant. Guides have a place for people who seek them, but they are in no way a mandatory requirement or else you deserve to get yelled at or kicked. If the person is running into groups over and over and wiping you, then you have an argument but a guide won't fix that lol. 
---
But anyway I think you're being very quick to say your experience is "ruined" by one noob. If you only have one noob in your group you should be more than capable to help them out? Or one of the other 3 people? Most people enjoy helping others. 
---
Devilsaur mafia
---
People being bad at the game was the biggest issue. Noone knew anything, including the good people. No easy videos to go look at how to down bosses and no "one-click" addon's to solve every imaginable issue. NO deadly boss mod.
---
Even though we were shit we still managed to down Rag as the third guild on the server.
---
But still...
---
First raid day in Molten core. Did not down the first boss because it was apparently too difficult to understand how to cure a curse. (Before addons solved that by dumming it down to a one buttom press).
---
Then we had to solve the whole issue of banishing on garr. We resolved to our GM and close friend having to target each mob and ask the warlock to /assist on him. Great times. No marks to assign easy targets..
---
On mag we had to be silent in voice chat because or our main tank couldn't focus on counting because he had to count to know when to use berserker rage to avoid being feared (horde..no fear ward).
---
All our hunters were so bad (bar one) that they had to have our one hunter in the guild actually log into their accounts and do the rhok'delar quest. Even our hunter that was "good" could not save us when we hit BWL and the trainwreck of kiting Razergore adds happened. We solved this by having our GM kite it on his mage, because he was "mad skills". 
---
Then we hit vael and the guild almost fell apart because we had like 1.5 geared tank. Me being one of the dps warriors at that time. My tank set consistet of swapping my weapon for a shield pretty much.Vael was shitting all over our guild for months. 
---
Everyone in our guild played alot and we just nolifed the shit out of it and by brute force became one of the top guilds on the server. We were not especially good, but then again the others were almost as shitty if not worse. Everyone was balls back then. In time we learned the game and became better and of course if you ask me now i'm probably the best player in the world (#NoJoke). But back then...jezz. 
---
So TLDR; Worst thing about progression was you pretty much brute forced your way through it because noone knew anything and noone had any skills which resulted in alot of drama because everyone obviously thought they were gods (#LikeMeObviously).
---
As a healer, I fully disagree. I will not take an arms/fury warrior in dps gear for a tank in UBRS, Strat, Scho, or DM:N. I expect the tank to be accumulating tank gear before hitting 60. Best to start at low 50s in places like BRD and Mara. Lots of good items there.
---
This was changed sometime mid-vanilla. He cannot be controlled now.
---
I got promoted from Trial to Member i one raid because I knew how to use Cleanse.
---
Good point, the fact that we play this game a second time and know what will come ahead does change a lot of the meta game. 
---
If you're talking simply about getting to a high rank in pvp then just play what you want.  In group pvp it's very unlikely that being a different race will set you back too far on your rogue.  Honestly, it's going to be much more about having good teamwork and the time you invest.  There is no 'rating' system.  Losses don't count against you the way they do in arenas/rbgs in retail.  You get more honor for a win than a loss and that's it.  So it's more about the time you invest in it.  
---
You have to decide if being weaker in pvp is something that you are willing to tolerate in the long term.
---
I have a feeling that the Blizzlike private vanilla 1.12.1 servers will be more realistic than retail classic - Blizzard's version is simply the original game on top of a modern client - I don't know what qualms you have with private servers, but while they aren't a perfect experience they are very close to retail vanilla. The main difference is that the majority of players actually know what they are doing, lol
---
We don't know what kind of concessions Blizzard will make to make classic more like modern WoW - Pay to play, right-click reporting, sharding etc. 
---
Just let them die over and over again till they have to leave the group since they ran out of money to repair their gear. Rule #1 is that you don’t piss off the person that has your live in their hands. 
---
Certain people will even yell at you if their fort buff has expired and you aren't immediately re-buffing them... its all about finding the right people to play with.
---
Another from the depths of my RSS memory, Taverncast. A great &amp; less serious podcast that was a lot of fun to listen to and you could tell they loved making it as much as I loved listening.
---
I might have to go back and listen to some of the older world of warcast episodes too.
---
So many great memories
---
Sharding will fix it /rolleyes
---
I'd say classic has much more to offer casual players than retail does. 
---
That’s only a thing on pservers and maybe pvp servers in classic. Pretty sure blizzard will pit a stop to cross faction collusion.
---
Those cons aren’t really cons. They are indefinite and chances. Chances that these groups are clearly willing to take or they wouldn’t be yelling or kicking the player. Logistically would rather reform the group for 5-10m than wipe for an hour or teach someone their class for an hour when the group signed up for a 20m run. The worst case is I spend 10m to reform a group. Oh well. Boo hoo. The worst if I keep an incompetent player is over an hour of wipes and headaches. Especially in max level content where players still somehow don’t know there classes. 
---
I just don’t get how hard it is. I wanted to try tanking coven with a pug. Told them upfront I may need help so put me on off-tank, and asked them when we were wiping if they wanted to find someone else and left so they could complete the run. It’s called putting yourself aside so the group can succeed. 
---
If most people enjoyed helping others instead of doing the content they signed up for these posts wouldn’t exist. So that’s just not true. Most players enjoy completing the content they sign up for and do not sign up to teach players the game and extend the time for completion by an unknown amount of time doing so. One person being unable to do their job and needing to be taught for an hour while wiping over and over doing so generally ruins the experience, yes. 
---
Yeah, the best they could probably do is a consort of Alexstrasza.
---
You don't need collusion to control it.  It could be possible that horde will own all the devilsaurs until alliance really pull together to make something happen there (or vice a versa) on some servers.
---
Doesnt matter on a non pvp server 
---
That didn't even occur to me, lol.  But you could still have a group of alliance and a group of horde control a large portion of the spawns, but it would allow for competition, you're right.
---
Tips is genuinely enthusiastic about vanilla/classic - a couple of his vids discussing dungeon &amp; raid design were really good.
---
I can't get behind everything he says. I do like the enthusiasm, though
---
"Just goes to show that being salty probably isn't conducive to problem solving."
---
The entirety of the internet needs to learn this.
---
repair bills as off-tank. Main-tank got spoiled, i had to farm tyrs hand, tyrs hand, tyrs hand... 
---
Probably, but I wouldn't put up with that. If your guild doesnt enforce treating people with respect find a new one that does. No reason to play with manchildren in a game this old.
---
Mage will get you a near-automatic invite to a lot of raid groups.
---
It will be harder to find a spot in raids as a Shadow Priest. If you really want to go Priest, learn to heal because a lot of groups will want a Priest healer.
---
I got to aq40 with essentially a band of idiots. It was amazing, really.
---
An expansion of sidegrades...
---
Mostly customer service folks.
---
Well, that's why the shadow weaving is now done by holy priests in try hard guilds. 
---
Whoever tags it first gets it. Simple as that. Since I’m a rogue usually so I’ll be right there to skin it when it dies. If there’s loot on it I won’t loot right away if someone is nearby. 
---
Oh so if the gear doesn't straight trash the previous tiers then it's not good? wow..this is why the game got in the state its in today
---
I would rather put up with farmers than WoW tokens. Let them ban goldsellers...
---
Did you play vanilla? 
---
It did not take 10 minutes to reform a group lol. It sometimes took an hour or more. People desperately tried to make the original group work because they knew it meant if not, they'd have to hearth to a city, and spam trade chat for however long it took to find a replacement, meanwhile hoping someone else didn't leave in the process adding more time finding another replacement. THEN, you have to either be summoned by a warlock if you're lucky, or spend the time running to the instance on foot or mount, which could also be another 15 minutes. Pretty big consequence to take a chance on.
---
Anyway, the choice you made in your legion scenario was your own. You offered to leave when no one asked you to. Also you described a raid, which is end game content where a guide would be more fitting to recommend to someone playing as bad as you describe. Not a 5 man dungeon.
---
Ah Muse. Right, thanks!
---
I don't know if there's a way to do this, I certainly haven't heard of one. That's pretty much the big appeal for soul bags, it keeps your shards tidy and it's easy to make a macro to delete them from there.
---
Unfortunately I recommend sucking it up and getting a soul bag. The loss of inv space isn't as bad as you might think.
---
Ya fuck that. Been playing wow for years, never had an account for wowhead and i am not going to make one now. ffs. 
---
Why would I buy an EXPANSION that offers 0 abilities progress
---
I love classic but I understand why tbc happened.
---
If you do dire maul north tribute run you can click on the invisible rabbit next to the king

**&lt;Hate&gt; (EU, Horde, PvP server) is recruiting knowledgeable raiders.**
---
**About us:**
---
Back in the days of glory, &lt;Hate&gt; was one of the top dogs on Boulderfist-EU (2006). More than a decade later, friends and old guild members are excited to announce that &lt;Hate&gt; is still alive !
---
Having a fine legacy at both Raiding and PvP, &lt;Hate&gt; scourged Boulderfist-EU, being nicknamed the “High Warlords Guild”, since we had the biggest amount of R14 players (names like Quatro, Zoby, Efe, Artificial, Hiphopyoyo, High come to mind). On the PvE scene, we almost cleared AQ40 and reached Naxxramas, and if we wouldnt’ve been a bit late to the party, with TBC around the corner, these raids would’ve been toast too. On a side note, we invented several strategies that are used even now, ahh, the times when everything was at first hand and you couldn’t possibly find tips and tricks like today...
---
Anyway, our plan is to rebuild &lt;Hate&gt; and push the envelope even further, aiming to assemble a very competitive raid that will last from first UBRS raid till Naxxramas. However, should be noted this time we’lll use a slight different approach and not go for the full hardcore experience. Instead, &lt;Hate&gt; will start as a semi-hardcore guild, thriving to build a really tight community of talented players that will be able to overcome everything. Now that we are older (but wiser!), we are fully aware that WoW Classic is a game that doesn’t evolve around who clears Molten Core fastest, but around which guilds still exist by the time serious stuff like AQ40 and Naxxramas is released. And as you probably know by now, statistics are quite grim: over 70% of the starting raiding guilds fail at clearing Blackwing Lair. Hence our approach.
---
**Our future raid times:**
---
&lt;Hate&gt; is going to have 3-4 hours raiding sessions, for 3 times a week (2 weekdays + 1 weekend day), starting late afternoons / early evenings. More closer to release we will update this post with new info.
---
Therefore, if you trully know that you are a talented player, don’t be shy and join our Discord server, available at [https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK](https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK) or you can directly apply to [www.hate-guild.eu](http://www.hate-guild.eu/) \- our site.

May this be the start of something truly spectacular.

P.S. Here it is, for your viewing pleasure, our first Nefarian kill, 2006 Boulderfist - EU.

Depends if ur garbage at the game or not
---
Similar here, got to the second or third boss in Naxx, and I was an idiot. 14 or 15 years old, had absolutely no idea what I was doing. There's even a video of my guild killing Anub'Rekhan for the first time, and it's kinda funny watching myself run around there, when I know that I was completely clueless.
---
And I wasn't the only one in the guild. We had so many weird specs. Raiding with arms warriors, retribution paladins, balance and feral druids, etc. And everyone was whatever race they preferred. Gnome warriors, night elf priests, ++.
---
Raiding in Vanilla had a huge skill cushion. It was made for people who had no idea what they were doing. That's what makes it so incredibly easy on private servers now. With people actually knowing what they're doing, most raids are cleared within hours of release.
---
This isn't a new idea... You could do this right now in retail. Buy gold to pay your sub,
---
Achievements are a "fake" reward. It promotes content for the sake of achievements, not content for the sake of content.
---
People did enemy faction leaders for fun. Until 3.0 when the achievements to kill them arrived. Today, the only reason to ever do them is for the achievements.
---
If they can't make activities in the game fun without achievements, how valuable are those activities really?
---
Funny you say this, last night on a pvt server my guild was meeting at Sentinel Hill.
---
A large group of raid geared 60s attracts attention and we had lowbies begging for gold.
---
I offered 5g to the winners of lowbie duels, my guildmate did the same.  He ended up giving away 50g on accident to "HandofGawd", meant to trade 5g.
---
HandofGawd made a quick exit and promptly put us both on ignore.
---
They have never been banned even long before Activision, but I guess that’s a minor detail that detracts from your narrative 
---
It doesn't even get 'hard' til Huhuran really..
---
I watch world first kills now and, say they're a mage, I'm like CAST! STOP HAVING DEAD GCDS! DO DPS haha
---
&gt; Everyone in our guild played alot and we just nolifed the shit out of it
---
Yeah, I vaguely remember progression being raiding every night, unlike pvt servers where guilds have scheduled raid days.
---
That would be an interesting marketing tactic though.
---
Why can’t I solo naxx? 
---
Just because one guy has 39 friends he gets to do 40x my damage?
---
Ok , you can have crusader strike at the cost of all your bubble shield spells.
---
When I first learned this on the forums back in 2007 I think it was?  Anyways it made me wonder just how many other games did things like this and it is super common.  Then i saw a post on some forum I liked at that time about MORE invisible things in WoW and it blew my mind!  Video games are all smoke and mirrors and I love it.
---
Wow, Huhuran is a name I haven't heard in a while (haven't personally raided much on pservers). Great memories from the first time we killed her. I believe I and maybe one other were the only two still alive when she died. Absolute chaos
---
This. I play on a pserver where farming elemental earth is the best way to get gold.
---
When I am farming elemental earth, I have no problem inviting a leveler into a group so they can grab the quest items.  Just ask someone and you will be able to complete the quest.  My guess is AQ is about to drop on your server (or already has) and people need endless nature protection pots.
---
Just being damaged interrupts hearthstone.
---
What about it, people also didn’t know how to play the game and didn’t use guides because they were faulty and largely didn’t exist accurately. If I remember right the first accurate equivalent to icy veins didn’t exist until the end of the life cycle of vanilla. The expectations were lower. This isn’t the case anymore. You go through this Reddit for one day and see huge amounts of meta game guides and how to do this with max efficiency. 
---
This isn’t going to be the same vanilla where every walked in didn’t know what was going on and had to teach each other. The expectations are going to be just as high as retail if not higher with the reduced mechanical difficulty of content. 
---
If you don’t think that these players aren’t going into end-game content blind you are wrong lol. This happens all the time every day with people using the same bogus excuse you are. The amount of guilds that have fallen apart because they can’t get 20 players that know how to play their class while applying to be MYTHIC raiders is absurd. 
---
The way I see it, it gives people a way to access anything on the Blizz store without actually spending cash (don't get me wrong, I hate the shop but for mount collectors this is a great way to access those mounts.) Its not like the people buying the gold are getting gold out of thin air. It comes from the pocket of another player so gold isn't being tossed into the economy willy nilly. People have been buying gold since Vanilla.... Blizzard just made a legal way of doing it.

 **&lt;Knights Templar&gt; - Alliance |NA – PvE| Semi-Hardcore**
---
**Introduction**: 
---
Knights Templar roots were established during World of Warcraft’s launch on the Zul’jin |US - PvE| server.  Our guilds mantra was “The causal guild that raids hardcore” and to a degree we will continue with that mantra during Classic WoW.  We accomplish this by having a very casual guild environment, but a very focused and dedicated raid environment.  Our goal is to progress through all raid tiers at a very strong pace.  
---
**What we Expect of Members**: 
---
We are looking for members who share the same mantra that was referenced above.  All members are expected to be respectful and polite when dealing with other members of the community.  It’s important to remember that when you join our guild, you represent us at all times.  For raid members, you will be expected to show up to raids on time and prepared to pull by raid start time. 
---
**Raid Times:**
---
Wednesday, Thursday and Sunday 8:00 -10:30 PM EST.
---
**Guild Website:**
---
[https://www.ktguild.com/](https://www.ktguild.com/)
---
**Discord**:
---
[https://discord.gg/Se55Scg](https://discord.gg/Se55Scg)
---
**Recruitment**:  
---
We are currently recruiting for all roles/classes.  Additionally, we are looking for a few very dedicated individuals for officer roles.  If you are interested in joining, message Papacy#2992 or Drobu#2181.  
---
If Blizzard delivers a worse Vanilla experience than private servers, they will never live down the memes. They might as well pack their bags at that point.
---
**&lt;TBD&gt; \[H\] US-PVP**
---
We are a Horde based guild (working on a name, we are holding a March Madness style vote in Discord eventually), specifically catering to those who want to raid casually, but just don't have the time anymore to commit tons of hours into the game. The bulk of our group is "9 to 5ers" who work, have families, or other commitments that prevent a more hardcore schedule.
---
We want to be an effective and efficient guild, clearing what we can, when we can. Make no mistake, we will experience all content of Vanilla, simply at a slower pace.
---
**Possible raid Schedule:**
---
2 days a week (likely weeknights, possibly 1 weeknight and Sunday). The window for raids times would between 8PM EST and 1AM EST. This does not mean we would raid during this entire time, only that we have the possibility if members are willing to stay awake and push until 1AM EST.
---
We will use some form of DKP or EP/GP. We will use NO loot council (outside of very specific items, such as Thunderfury for the main tank) as it lacks transparency and perceived fairness.
---
If a casual guild for you "9 to 5ers" sounds enticing, please PM me and I can send you the Discord link.
---
You could see a few name plates of these bunnies in Stormwind during the Pre-Cata event too. 
---
Yes Blizzard is at their peak. /s
---
As Classic is using 1 costum API derived from the legion client it is impossible to know working macros as off now.
---
Mybe if blizz would give us a beta?
---
pretty sure it wont be 200-300g though, its supply and demand. the set only costed that much on the "megaservers" but the ones with 3-4k population I've played on (kr\*nos, ely) the set was like 100-150g. And since the profit was not as much the mafia was not so organized, you would have a group of 3-4 people farm them for a few hours and then leave. I'm guessing it will be the same on classic
---
Progression time commitment is going to vary, but here's how long raids tend to take when they are totally on farm with 0 wipes to give you an absolute minimum baseline. You really want to dedicate at least three times as much time as I list to make solid progress during progression:
---
MC: 1 hour.
---
BWL: 1 hour.
---
AQ40: 2 hours.
---
Naxx: 4 hours.
---
This doesn't count any time needed to get to the raid or prepare world buffs like Ony/ZG head turn ins.
---
Hardcore speedrunning guilds can clear raids in about half the time I listed but requires max consumables, world buffs, everyone being really focused the whole time and using speedrun strats, etc.
---
So you're saying you didn't play vanilla? 
---
Of course it's not going to be exactly the same as vanilla, but it won't be like retail either. It will be more like vanilla than modern expansions however. Community was an important aspect, and people remember who was a jerk. 
---
I 100% know players will still go into raids blind. That isn't what I was talking about though. Again, as I already said, it's a different scenario than a 5 man dungeon. Sure, kick the guy in Molten Core who keeps ignoring mechanics. That's expected. Are you really going to kick someone in WC though because they pulled aggro off you while you're tanking? No, you'd tell them to be careful with aggro and let them know how it works. You're a dick if you get aggressive in WC, end of story.
---
I have converted tokens into $350 battle net balance. So my monthly sub is taken care of for the next forever.
---
But that doesn't matter, it's outside of game and doesn't affect anything. How many players had their moms paying their subs during Vanilla?
---
Tokens have 0 impact on classic economy. Or should high income earners be penalized, since paying $15/mo is easier on them than part time students. Outside of wow is outside of wow.
---
You could also just sell your Classic gold for cash to pay your sub. I don't see the difference. In the end you are just giving it to Blizzard. People who want to pay their sub using Classic gold will find a way to do so (although with the value of Classic gold early on, I doubt many people will be doing this.)
---
The only problem with WoW Tokens and Classic for me will be if they allow them to directly be bought with Classic gold. 
---
I currently play on a pserv as a Dwarf Rogue.  On alliance, the competition for BIS swords is extreme.  A good dagger rogue will out DPS an average human sword rogue.  Once AQ/naxx hits, crit gear will become plentiful and rogues can switch their builds to seal fate daggers.
---
I have no regrets no playing a human.  I have much less competition for my weapons, and daggers are substantially more fun, especially in BGs/wpvp.  The only downside is that dagger rogues are a bit slower at solo farming than sword rogues.
---
&gt; I watch world first kills now and, say they're a mage, I'm like CAST! STOP HAVING DEAD GCDS! DO DPS haha
---
Might have been throttling for threat purposes.
---
Can I ask why would it be so difficult to give abilities to non character objects? I feel like that would be a staple of whatever engine/language the game is being developed with.
---
So I’m saying I did, “what about it”. 
---
Who tf yells at someone in leveling WC? If that is this guy’s concern...This is more of a non-issue than the overplayed healer abuse problem. I’ve leveled over 34 characters to the 100-120 range and have only seen this is rare cases. You can barely get people leveling or doing WC to talk at all let alone yell at you.
---
I think BFA is actually easier to get into than vanilla for newbies
---
Lemme trigger you and me right now. Ret Pali + Righteous Fury.
---
&gt;  getting the same 40-43 people online consistently enough to make any progress
---
Honestly I don't remember this being an issue, if anything we had trouble finding spots for everyone and eventually had to transition to a first come first serve sign up sheet on our guild site forums, we always had people waiting on the sidelines for when someone had to log off for the night or couldn't make it that night/week. 
---
Private servers have population caps way over what vanilla servers had. So there are way more people than the world was made for. I don't have the exact numbers, but I believe vanilla servers had population caps of 2-3000 players. Some private servers have more than tripled that. 
---
So no, classic will not be quite as crowded as pservers.
---
I hope so!  That would be great
---
Huhu isn't even hard if you have 15 properly geared soakers and people bring nature pots.
---
Skeram is a wild card though, my guild wiped on him 3 times before finally downing then we proceed to 1-2 shot everything else except for cthune. 
---
Is going to the AH hard?
---
Depends on how min-max you are. When I played in 2004-2006 I did not pick my races based on mix-max'ing their racials. Sounds like a boring way to play, to me. But to others they would find playing a race with weaker racials boring. Only you can have this answer.
---
If you're worried about getting into dungeons or MC PuGs, or getting made fun of in BG's or something, then don't be. People aren't gonna care what race you are. This sub spends a lot of time talking about min-max and hardcore cutting edge raiding but at the end of the day 90% of them are going to be relatively casual players.
---
OP was asking about raiding but acknowledged it for dungeons pre 60 as well, saying he could handle it.
---
All of your experience seems to come mostly from modern expansions. Where as most of mine comes from vanilla and TBC. People talked in every single dungeon in vanilla and tbc. You absolutely needed to in order to play. It was a very different experience compared to legion or the likes.
---
And IDK, that's what I've been trying to figure out lol. I don't know why someone would bother to yell at someone pre 60, kick them and tell them to read a guide. I haven't been talking about raids.
---
Until you decide to level up herbalism at the same time.
---
yes i understand.
---
my point is that statistically, assuming equal distribution of skill (as well as difficulty of boss mechanics), 75% of the raid members will cause about 75% of the wipes -- regardless of their role.
---
Items, experience,etc are "fake" rewards. They promote content for the sake of an achievement. Not content for the sake of content. He'll I remember the good ole days when we did the quests just for the lore! If they can't make activities in the game fun without these " fake" rewards, how valuable are these activities!? 😄
---
Hyjal should be a guild raid outdoor content area for guild farming / PvP
---
I mean, it's not that crazy of an idea. FF11 did it for [7 years, from 2003 to 2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XI#Expansions_and_add-ons), Everquest 1 and 2 [only bumped levels sometimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EverQuest#Expansions) ([EQ2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EverQuest_II#Expansions)). Guild Wars 1 and 2 have never increased level caps. If anything, WoW is an outlier for increasing levels and gear every expansion.
---
I'd like to note that this is a very good group of people.  Very welcoming, friendly, and helpful players.  If you want a guild that has a casual feel and completes raid content early and often, look no further than Knights Templar.
---
Still looking for more competent and friendly players to round out our roster.  Check out our website and discord for more information.
---
Yes they did back then but I don’t think it would be accurate to insist that same level will exist today. Yes there will be returning players that want to re-experience it but I would bet a lot of it’s population is going to be retail players who never experienced it and want to see and will bring retail culture influence with them. Maybe though. 
---
Another thing that has been hurting in-game communication for a lot of games is the availability of services like discord. If a group of 2+ players in past would group up with others on a game it was likely they still used the game chat features where as now those two+ will likely be in discord communicating with themselves and ignoring other.  Time will tell I guess.
---
&gt; Did not down the first boss because it was apparently too difficult to understand how to cure a curse. (Before addons solved that by dumming it down to a one buttom press).
---
To be fair, the default raid frames were hot garbage--IIRC, they weren't capable of displaying debuffs.  The hardest part of those fights was figuring out who needed decursing in the first place.  As you mentioned, addons make this trivially easy now.
---
Prior to ZG, you remember correctly.
---
The fix wasn't late until like 1.11 or 1.12
---
Remember that Classic is going to have a TON of angry neckbeards. And when they die, they will blame everybody other than themselves (They've been playing on private servers for years, obviously the death wasn't their mistake, right?) 
---
People will bitch and complain frequently. Just inform them that you won't be healing for them in the future and put them on your block list. Healers have all the power in Vanilla. 
---
My only fear that classic will fail isn't that it's fueled by nostalgia, it's that it will eventually get old. They are going to have to have a plan for several months or even a year after we get to the end. People will start to leave and the game will slowly die if there's no new content. The issue is do they create whole new content (highly doubtful) or release tbc servers to transfer to possibly. 
---
This is mitigated by the fact that it takes TONS of MC runs before you build up enough dkp for Perditions or BRE and the drop chance is annoyingly low.
---
40 people, 5-6 your class, all fighting for rare drops. If you did get perditions you likely didn’t get any other gear.
---
And even then, lots of rogues got perdition and still sucked in PvP, still got countered by mages and the like.
---
They struck a good balance.
---
Honestly there's nothing troll or wrong with the first build, it's just a PI build. 
---
Most hardcore guilds use some PI priests, because they boost speedkills using PI on the mages and they can just use some extra consumables for specific heal-heavy bosses, or just PI themselves in a hard situation.
---
The perfect excuse to have pvp talents in your build, and a pretty fun build to play overall.
---
I still remember the screenshot of someone replacing their T2 belt at level 62 and essentially wanting to quit the game because all their work had been invalidated by a blue quest reward.
---
Mind you I never raided enough in vanilla to be good, so to then 13 year old me was excited for the adventure ahead.
---
Dungeons tend to be far more 'chill' than raids.  Most of the time when people make mistakes in vanilla people will try to coach you instead of yell at you because the time it takes to replace someone is insane.  In retail it's very easy to replace a person which is part of why the game is unsatisfying.  In Vanilla if you wipe on the last boss of an instance because the healer messed up and they say "sorry guys, that got out of control fast" most people will just say "np bud lets get it next time".  It varies by group, but for the most part that holds true.  
---
In raids on the other hand, it really depends on the leadership.  Some raid leaders can be quite hardcore and unforgiving of mistakes.  Others can forgive a lot but will eventually reach their limit if you keep messing things up.
---
[You can't kill him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn7sychEanA)
---
Yea, was waiting for someone to link a PI build so I figured I'd be the first. It offers so much utility as far as PvP and early pve go.
---
I love encountering another average player in pvp
---
The most memorable pvp fights I had were against average players and we both bumblefucked through our spells struggling to win it.
---
For the most part, people know if the pull is to big. But yeah there will always be idiots that have no idea how healing works, and how hard it is to cast a spell with a fucking random mob beating on you. 
---
Right.. it's been since wotlk or maybe cata that I didn't have DBM already tell me how to handle the boss mechanics the very first time I run something.  I use the tool because it makes me a better player, but it definitely takes a lot out of the experience.  Learning how to handle boss mechanics and putting together a boss strat was one of my favorite parts of playing WoW and that is completely and forevermore gone.  
---
I remember putting together sarth 3 drake strats and tanking positions and all that.  We didn't use a guide, we just tweaked our strat until it worked and we eventually got it through practice and patience.  
---
Mythic raiding now is about finding a template and forcing your raid into it until the loot drops.
---
The best you can really do is select a realm with your friends and hope for the best. Unless you want to wait a month after it drops to get a feel for the landscape first.
---
It has to, to some extent. There is a lot more crowd controlling that is necessary in vanilla 5 mans. AoE dps wasn't really a thing back then. Was just communicating well which adds to CC, and which to dps down, while avoiding patrolling mobs. And in the case of an accidental patrol pull, you have to CC those as well. It becomes hectic if no one communicates. 
---
I used ventrilo all the time with my friends back then and in-game chat was never an issue to participate in simultaneously. I'm sure many peole I grouped with also were in vent but never let on. So I'm not worried about that at all.
---
I believe retail lost touch with communication in dungeons when dungeons became too easy to utilize AoE dps. The game doesn't become challenging until mythic levels which is a small chunk of the game that players see. A person in retail wow dungeons can effectively pretend to not exist if they feel like and the group hardly notices. My last dungeon I ever did in retail wow (BFA) I was healing a 5 man, and got accidentally locked out of an encounter. The remaining 4 finished the fight in 30 seconds without even needing me. I'd never imagine that possible in vanilla lol. You immediately know in vanilla if someone is not doing well by their performance or lack of utilities they offer not being used.
---
Rogues shine in 1v1 and wpvp. 
---
In BGs, honestly I’ve found them boring to play.
---
Not sure about WoW, but with Warcraft 3, it was either a limitation of the engine or just something the developers never considered.
---
Without actually modifying the engine it's not possible to give a tree the ability to heal you or to summon guards. The closest you can get is making a unit/building with the tree's model and giving it those abilities.
---
Alternatively, if you didn't mind spending a bunch of extra time writing triggers, which were kind of like lines of code for your map specifically, you could place a trigger down around the tree and have it do those things. But that takes a lot more time. You have to place the trigger zones (which told the game what was entering the zone), then you had to write the actual trigger its self, which might not be possible of doing what you wanted (like I'm not sure if it's possible to have a trigger regenerate health as opposed to healing you to full outright), then you have to test them and make sure they work for every possible scenario and can't be abused.
---
Go back to bfa. This is classic.
---
If you're a good goy then they won't be  
---
Honestly, there’s a very real chance that (at least initially) pop caps will be above that of vanilla because of the potential for massive drop offs from the people that only play for a while. It’s probably better to have some servers very populated early on and then balance out to vanilla like servers after people stop playing than to have a huge number of fairly low populated servers. 
---
I think a big point people need to realize, especially playing on big pop pservers, is that you don’t need to do X quest by any means. If it’s very important to your class, try to communicate like already mentioned and make it clear that you only want to get your quest items and then move on. If all else fails, and bear with me here, you can actually just skip a quest. I’m level 28 at ~21 hours /played and I’ve skipped every single escort quest because there’s so many people doing them and the quest giver seemingly never respawns right after the escort is finished. Just grind something close to your level and move on, that one quest will likely not hurt you very much at all.
---
I just hope to win the lottery and end up on a streamer free EU PvP server.
---
Wow, never played the modern versions, but those new environments do look pretty great.
---
Druids heal
---
I can't agree more with the issue of addons telling you about mechanics before you personally even knew they existed. It's so boring to already know everything there is to win. Literally feels like cheating to me.
---
I used to be pretty upset in new dungeons i was a few days late to their openings, and everyone is already rushing past the bosses. I miss the moments you stand in front of the boss and your group is talking in chat "anyone know this fight?" and everyone says "nope!" 
---
This sounds a lot like the first guild I was in, so I am very interested. 
---
This
---
Played rogue recently to 60 on private server.   a truly skilled and amazing rogue is very rare
---
So many skills, so much CC, a skill reset button, but you’re so squishy, and if you fuck up one rotation you can get toasted fast
---
Plus your good CDs are all 5 - 10 minutes long so if you pop that prep at the wrong time you’re losing out 
---
Fortunately all the hardcore players are gonna save us by recommanding to ban every "offspecs" from raids, because otherwise it's too hard.
---
Even ouro/viscidous??
---
You can be pretty sure that most big streamers are not going to play on a PvP server. Their life would be hell there.
---
I'm certain it was more just.... Hesitance.
---
Just remember if you plan on going Mining or Herbalism, you need to swap the "Find" skills quite often to take advantage of your racial.
---
Also, welcome brother!
---
At the end of the day, each raid boss needs to drop at least 2 pieces of gear. Unless they're just gonna drop shit loads of gold/resources. People want a reason to farm the new raid. I can come up with a bunch of non-gear rewards but people will want a Tier 4 at some point.
---
examples:
---
The final boss of the new raid drops an item that you can turn in once for +X to a stat of your choice.
---
The extra raids could reward a dual spec token turn in for killing the final boss.
---
A trinket that lets your mounts go EVEN faster than Carrot/Spurs/Gloves combo.
---
Extra spell ranks
---
Awesome mounts
---
Heirlooms (shoot me)
---
New Spells
---
If you clear Naxx+ content, since the content must be harder to be Naxx+, it must reward better stuff.
---
Cosmetic rewards are antithetical to the spirit of vanilla though. You look good when you have good gear (generally). I suppose in this instance you'd have good gear since you're clearing Naxx+ content though.
---
There are no systems to cater to horizontal progression in Classic that could affect all classes equally
---
It won't effect development. What I read said no devs are being laid off. It's all other depts. 
---
Now it's "Big strike of doom coming in 5 seconds stack on tank" .. "4".. "3".. "2".. "1".. and split damage to everyone on the tank... or a big box on your screen that says stay 5 yards from a player and alerts you if you're too close....
---
Yeah first huhu kills are wild. Last 10% terrifying haha.
---
I hope to be lucky and get a PvP server that is good for both sides, but without too many people. I actually want the war effort to last more than 2 weeks
---
Sorry, I might have not expressed myself clearly. My concern was with pve and sword spec, and lack thereof on the dwarf side. However, I got my clarification that dwarf can go dagger spec in raiding.
---
The question about perception was related to pvp scenario but I decided to roll dwarf because I got inspired by a dwarf looking king slayer in witcher 2. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCXw8m0PHI
---
Deep breath is random.
---
Classicast is a modern one
---
This happened on my realm also. So much drama that guilds split as some people were clearing Kara as others with less time were still grinding levels or rep. Killed more guilds than any raid released 
---
That's good to know, I did prefer running with daggers on the test server and really enjoying dwarf right now. 
---
Who says it needs to affect all classes equally? The current raids certainly don’t.
---
lol I've gotten into long arguments with close friends about this. My friends just like the "how is more information a bad thing" argument. I prefer to figure the information out on my own by playing the game and reading contextual text from the boss himself. Learning their movements, reading debuffs myself while I have them, etc. 
---
I'm so surprised I appear to be in the minority with this everywhere I talk about it. I really can't find anything fun about how retail handles dungeons/raids.
---
&gt;horde doesn't have fancy sword specialization and they are doing just fine in pve.  
---
&gt;I think find treasure racial seals the deal for me.
---
I don't even know why I even considered humans... I literally always play dwarves and gnomes. Just got called a meme on the server and started wondering xD But it's too late, the dwarf dynasty continues.
---
Unless they are a pvp streamer lol
---
You say that but they could delay the stream by 5-10 minutes and then it’s okay. Or they will have a hankering squad of followers that protect them. They will have it easy where ever they go. Streams get stuff given to them, protection will be one of the things they get. 
---
I think all of the Warlock sets look dope, one of the reasons I’m thinking about rolling one for Classic. I’ve also really never played a Lock before in my 14 years of playing WoW, so it’d be a nice change for me 
---
There are some instant 60 Pservers you could try tanking with a warrior on. Warrior tanking in vanilla is even different than TBC. We got alot of new skills in TBC which increased our multi target abilities. In vanilla tanking multiple mobs is an awful lot of tab, sunder, tab, sunder. Defense cap is also a bit of a struggle to reach before raids and must be focused on before you set foot in any raid. 
---
Even then, its still Magni. He is the most well protected by layout and gaurds.
---
The most powerful would be Sylvana's and Varmiathras, with or without the swarm of elite gaurds and the war masters.
---
The strongest individually is Saurfang, but there is no reward to attacking him, alliance have the backdoor to completely circumvent attacking him, and he is right by the bank and AH.  Literally a death sentence to even attempt to kill him.
---
They could do a 5 year cycle of Classic&gt;TBC&gt;WLK in perpetuity.
---
In THEORY yes, but in reality no two players will ever be the same, no raid will be the same.
---
Sometimes you get lucky and stuff proccs more than for another person. There is just too much randomness in an raid evening, which makes the racials over all not noticeable to the naked eye.
---
In PvP maybe. But how do you even measure the racials. It is even more player and situational depended.
---
You're talking about gear though, not horizontal progression.
---
Also because the people carrying you through are all those classes that don't get affected.
---
GL getting your mages, rogues, warlocks and warriors to turn up when they don't get anything out of it.
---
How do you know this?
---
Eviscerate deals damage based on rank no? So what’s different in those roguecraft videos to a standard 1.12 server? People are still pulling that stuff off in pservers
---
&gt; lowbie trolls because i respect they arent tryin to min max
---
Until you realize that trolls are the master race for raiding, but most troll players are not even aware of that.
---
I love that moment when you see an opponent in the distance, you're both on your mounts and stop...those tense few seconds just standing there....who's going to make the move...then you both charge at each other!
---
To be fair.... there wasn't even default raid frames at the start.
---
5 years would be too long in today's climate. Probably 2-3 years if they release content on a schedule and not all at once, which I'm sure they will.  Knowing blizzard they'll just keep going and we'll end up with 2 different live servers.
---
Also, not EU.
---
I hope they allow vanish to cancel incoming spells. 
---
If you can’t vanish incoming frost bolts then mages can just chain them and laugh while your vanish immediately gets cancelled.
---
The new level caps in expansions haven't been progress, they've been resets.
---
This. I was a guest host a couple times back in vanilla. I loved listening to it back when I was questing. 
---
&gt; If the tank died and mobs were being properly CC'd, it was probably the healer's lack of performance. If a DPS pulled agro and died, we all saw it. If a tank pulled too many mobs, it was obvious.
---
The less obvious one, that I feel like I see as a healer, is spreading the DPS. DPS doesn't focus a target, tank is spread too thin, and group is not reducing damage (by killing a target) fast enough for the healer to keep up. Then the DPS usually blames the tank for letting a mob kill them, or the healer for slacking off
---
What would progress entail, WITH a level cap?
---
This made me laugh.  I was  the mage class leader and was only 13 years old.  Not because I was good but because I was the only one who liked and consistently played frost so I did the best mage dps by frostbolt spamming compared to our other mages who would go fire or Pom pyro and couldn’t afford to respec progressing through MC.
---
I always let peope know that I will mention OOM/drink if I need it, but ultimitely it's on you to check my mana before you pull; if I'm under 50% or in the middle of buffing (paladin), assume I'm going to drink or at least ask. I see people chain pull before I can even type oom
---
&gt; Blessing of Sanctity
---
There is no spell with that name. Do you mean Sanctity Aura or Blessing of Sanctuary?
---
&gt; Eviscerate deals damage based on rank no?  
---
My memory was fuzzy on this, so I checked.  Eviscerate gains scaling with AP in patch 1.12.  
---
&gt; So what’s different in those roguecraft videos to a standard 1.12 server?  
---
Eviscerate deals less damage on a naked rogue, and more damage on a rogue in MC-ish gear and beyond.  
---
&gt; People are still pulling that stuff off in pservers  
---
I'm sure at any given time, there's someone undergeared and unprepared enough to die to a naked rogue on a pserver, even after the naked rogue nerf / good rogue buff.
---
The fuck are you talking about? Sharding is already confirmed to be temporary and loot sharing is a system designed to cut out a middle man. It's objectively easier for all parties involved. 
---
You're lost in the outrage culture. Children enjoy grouping up and getting mad about things together. An underwhelming WoW expansion and the discontinuation of a dead e-sport isn't enough to convince me that the sky is falling. I don't know why I'm bothering though. Anyone who unironically brings up Activision isn't worth the time of day. Please educate yourself about Blizzard's relationship with them, and how they have little to no effect on Blizzard's decisions. 
---
What do you mean? What kind of expansion they could do without increasing the levelcap?
---
&gt; I have converted tokens into $350 battle net balance. So my monthly sub is taken care of for the next forever.  
---
Yea, there's no way that "someone grinding in retail pays for their classic subscription" is any kind of issue.  It's not like any constant amount of money means the same to any two people in the first place.
---
I would say that managing raiding guild was tough job. Never been in leading positions, but I witnessed the struggle of replacing people who quit. Every month you would get post on guild forums of bye bye. Then finding reliable people again, help them gear up... Doooh
---
Yea those are the only two that took us two attempts each but everything else including twin emps we downed first try. 
---
&gt;Noone knew anything
---
Our first binding of the windseeker went to a hunter because we had no idea what it was and hunter was on there...
---
&gt; Wonder what difference does it actually make in the end.  
---
It's still a difference.  Your napkin math is a good first order estimate I think.  You're trying to raid well, why not go for max dps?
---
a 10 minute delay wont do much when you're farming the same place for 2 hours and on top of that a 10 minute delay stream isn't really worth watching.
---
Love it. I always type /challenge to initiate a respectable duel
---
In a PvE scenario, granted, I absolutely agree.
---
As for a PvP scenario, personally, I would sacrifice a few stats, nothing too game-breaking, in order to have a good Raptor Strike weapon. Having that powerful Raptor Strike available will be a game changer since even in melee range you will still be a threat for the according classes.
---
I.E.: Better stats dual-wielding one handers VS. Lesser stats very slow two hander,
---
I hope they'll announce the servers before classic launches,people could easily choose and make discussions about which server are they're going to choose.
---
&gt; horde no fear ward
---
What about tremor totem?
---
if you're concerned about it - wait a month and then start playing
---
&gt; ...And introduce new ones, because you aren't solving the problem, you're just putting it somewhere where it does not affect you yet.
---
Btw, this is what devs mean when they say "players don't know what they want".
---
In general people will just suggest something that fixes their issues, giving 0 effort into thinking through the consequences, and if any the crowd that excited for classic should understand why that's bad.
---
&gt; For an actual solution: [...]
---
So much this, I've been in OP's exact sitation at that exact place... I whispered like 3 people "hey, I got a quest here, any chance we could group up? I'll give you any elementals if they drop" before I got an invite and was able to easily finish the quest.
---
No thankssssss lol. Fall behind, been waiting long enough :P
---
"yikes!"
---
What a mess these things are. 
---
That doesnt work long term. 
---
I don't understand how you jump between the two.
---
Being a Devilsaur Mafia is only profitable if you actually sell the leather.
---
in AV and AB, good rogues shine.
---
&gt; Pretty sure blizzard will pit a stop to cross faction collusion.
---
Why?
---
Aggro is not really something to worry about as a healer. Typically it's just a single button push to dump your threat if you have to heal the tank so hard that you pull aggro. The only other times you'll pick up aggro is if the dps is pulling off the tank and you have to heal them, or if a heal goes off right as a patrol gets picked up. Neither of those two cases are your fault. Stay close to your tank so he can taunt off you, but not so close you get cleaved. Tanks and healers have a special bond and will watch out for each other.
---
Money making in general was just hard, even for good farming classes. It REALLY sucked for tank/heals though because it basically necessitated an alt.
---
Hop in the discord and check us out! Real friendly group, anxious to start raiding in classic!
---
Being lvl 40 when 8000 people are farming for aq nr pots is not a good idea. 
---
Because why not? I for one like a little bit of variety, and they would do a fine job of it while totem twisting for the melee thats grouped with them. Yes their dps isnt top end, no i dont care if a fight lasts 15-30 seconds longer.
---
Releases new raids, you get learnable spells in the new raids, new zones that you have to complete quests to unlock, etc. anything that has a level requirement in tbc can just be changed to quest requirements.
---
I played on K3 for a few months recently. Forced myself to stop so I don't get burned out on it. Honestly retail WoW is just so tasteless for me now I don't think I'll ever play it again. It's going to be all classic for me or no WoW at all. 
---
If they punish cross faction collusion, there wont be a monopoly like on pservers.
---
Liberalisation=the process which liberates. In this context, gold trade. It would not be a full “liberalisation”, in fact a monopoly - although still a step over illegal, as it should be.
---
Illidan.  I loved the Black Temple.  Everything about it was perfect.  Vanilla raids - C'thun.  The first true guild breaker.
---
You had that, but tremor totem had a radius and works on pulses of fear removal. So if you lagged or were unlucky with the timing of the fear vs the timing of the tremor pulse you could actually get feared out of the totem’s radius
---
and then demoted in the next raid, because someone didn't want to give you loot
---
AV is boring. Rogues can’t do anything in a team fight except maybe dive the back line and suicide a healer. But that’s nearly always results in your death. You can cap towers too, but also boring to me.
---
AB a bit more fun.
---
Still find them lacking in big group pvp relative to other classes

The core of the guild has been playing together on the private server scene for a while. While we are still months away from retail classic launch, we wanted to begin the process of building a player-base for the big show.
---
As information comes in regarding the more nuanced questions surrounding the game (e.g. reverting from 16 to 8 debuffs at launch, dungeon loot itemization/tables, splitting Dire Maul / ZG into separate phases etc), we'll be updating our internal resources and plans accordingly. We'll be fully prepared for launch, join now!

I assume there will be free character transfers if its too bad? I used to be a balanced server as horde, but eventually all the horde left and it was dominated by alliance. I remember transferring off to another server for free.
---
“You fucking idiots”
---
Yeah those were around, it’s just when you make a guild and grow it and all that jazz it’s just pretty difficult when your roots are set 
---
I definitely should've remembered Maladath.
---
Private servers has been cleaver to expand it to denying the opposite faction world buffs too. You see thrall has a 24hour respawn (i think it was actually higher in retail), so everyone who wants warcheifs blessings well unfortunate for you. 
---
This is a sign of good guild recruitment. 
---
A lot of guilds will have an opening for a single mage and they will recruit a single mage. But the best way to recruit a mage would be to bring in 5 new mages and see how many can/will stick around. Hopefully some will be good but also maybe some will be casual enough to fill the bench. You always need some amount of casual players in any kind of raiding guild. 
---
In AV, 2-3 good rogues can make 37 People win by capping Towers and AS / RH. 
---
This is an epic response. Kudos to you. 
---
&gt;it was apparently too difficult to understand how to cure a curse. (Before addons solved that by dumming it down to a one buttom press).
---
there was also a period in between, called "X-Perl Unit Frames")
---
&gt; On mag we had to be silent in voice chat 
---
You were "lucky" enough to have a voice chat. Most guilds back then didn't have one, and if they had, well... come on. It was 2004. People actually **didn't have phones**. And no laptops. So, no mics, unless you bought one just for this guild.
---
And then, internet was like in 2004, not 2019. You were already lucky when someone heard what you've said...
---
For me, voice chat was nothing but an additional burden of deciphering all that 16kbps voices. And, I didn't also like the idea of giving up in-game sounds, and also ventrilo was quite overloading my sound card, causing some sounds to not play at all. My sound card actually didn't work perfectly.
---
&gt; All our hunters were so bad 
---
you mean huntard and petard?
---
&gt; 1.5 geared tank 
---
Are you talking about GearScore?
---
From a coding PoV it's easier to just create a character with the ability/action and place the object asset over the NPC skeleton, rather than create an entirely new type of model that has properties of an NPC but acts as an object.
---
tldr, it's recycling code that sounds weird when explained the way it is but is perfectly functional
---
It only ticks every few seconds. A good shaman will stand just outside the fear range and drop it right when the fear goes out (the first tick is instant) but like he said ... they weren't very good
---
Does anyone  know if Damage/Healing done was shown on  Battleground Dashboards in Patch 1.12 ?  
---
They can. They're also the best off-tanks in classic. They have the most health, the most mitigation, and the most threat. They can't become uncrittable to bosses so you usually don't want them for that, but literally anything that's not a boss is better tanked by a druid.
---
And some bosses. You'll want a feral MT for Patches, who can't crit but can Hateful Strike, which is a massive spike of damage better mitigated by a druid's armor and health pool than anything a warrior has access to.
---
Historically, mafia has only sold the sets in trades on world chat and not on the AH. This is to keep control of the price. People can't undercut them effectively if the correct price is not well known. 
---
I'm curious if you remember, Why did everyone seem to farm tyrs hand back in the day? Its all elite mobs that drop basically the same loot as the non elites around the corner. Its not a good farm on private servers other than running in for the lotus if it spawned there. Was there something else to it or was it just assumed that elite mobs = better gold
---
&lt;Spellplague&gt;
---
Alliance - US-PvP - primarily east coast players
---
Our guild leadership consists of players from as far back as WoW Alpha. We're a relaxed group that plays various games together outside of WoW. Every vanilla server we've rolled on has seen us steamroll raids due to our intimate knowledge of the game during the classic era.
---
Many of our members will be pushing for Grand Marshal and leading a ranking pre-made group on whichever server we select at launch. We have reliable leveling paths and help available to those who need extra information to get ahead in classic, and we encourage anyone who is willing to learn to ask our experienced players any questions they have about the game and their class.
---
In our experience some of the best players are recruited as newbie WoW first-timers. And that's great. Classic WoW is the perfect environment to learn how to be a pro raider, if you can find those willing to teach you. Come with a positive attitude and willingness to learn, and we'll help you to become one of our core raiders that pushes content with some of the fastest clear speeds on the server.
---
We're expecting raid days to take place Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday nights EST. Exact times are yet to be determined, but off nights are eventually planned for alt raids and other optional content. We also recruit bench raiders who don't want, or can't have, a consistent raid schedule, but enjoy being pulled in when a spot needs filled.
---
Outside of raids, we have many players who enjoy a variety of games together. Among these are such games as D&amp;D, Rust, Atlas, CS:GO, Path of Exile, Minecraft, BDO, and more. While not required, we encourage our members to play other games together during content droughts.
---

---
iirc, when wow was first developed it was on the wc3 engine, so exteremely unsurprising that they used the same strategies
---
&gt; So TLDR; Worst thing about progression was you pretty much brute forced your way through it because noone knew anything and noone had any skills which resulted in alot of drama because everyone obviously thought they were gods (#LikeMeObviously).
---
While this was your worst experience, I'd classify this as the best thing about classic raiding, personally. Learning encounters, learning what they are doing and not being expected to know everything on the very first pull - THAT WAS FUN. Being bad -&gt; getting better, that's what classic - to me - was all about. Even reaching Naxxramas back in the day we still had no clue. Noone REALLY understood how Patchwork worked. Eventually we figured it out after a few WTFs during the first raid night on him.
---
That's why I won't give too much about classic raiding. Way TOO MANY guilds will expect everyone to know everything and have the best buffing items in the game, etc... Can't imagine that being fun at all.
---
True. But then the talents to get those 'enhancement' talent totems is gimping his build.   The typical full restoration raiding shaman is 0/5/46.
---
You'd have to invest 7 more talent points into the enhancement tree to get the 2/2 Enhancing totems talent.  And a resto shaman would. Ever be able to go deep enough to get improved weapon totems talent.
---
IMO (and that's a key word here...this is my ideal raiding situation) a deep enhancement shaman with both wielding Nightfall axe is helping the raid in a lot of different ways.  And before you start saying "but but...wing clip hunters..." yea.  I'm sure the hunter class just loves the idea of gimping their DPS to melee spam.  Its about playing to the strengths of each class/spec.  Not pigeon holing a hunter into spamming wing clip when he could be doing better DPS (safer too) from a distance.
---
Ideal raid comps means you take the utility hybrid class and give them a utility hybrid role. SHAMAN.  You dont take a pure dps class such as hunter or warrior and tell them to gimp their DPS by wielding an axe and spamming a single skill over and over.
---
Oh also.  Your resto shaman cant totem twist due to GCD and mana costs of totems the resto shaman eont be able to do that.  An enhancement shaman could.  
---
Even some guilds started taking Boomkins and putting them in the fire mage group for Ignite procs once your guild is no longer focused on MC/BWL.  Others started putting shadow priests for shadow weaving. There plenty of "meme" specs that still provide utility and DPS increase by enabling their party/raid. Not by being yet another person fighting to see who has the biggest DPS dick.
---
&gt; Blessing of Sanctuary
---
typo into incorrect auto correct.
---
I used to have so much fun on my 60 rogue just chilling in STV, waiting for someone in general chat to ask for help with someone corpse camping. I didn't like to gank personally, but had no problem roughing up the bullies lol. 
---
Can't wait to do it again and help out, but on the alliance side this time!
---
I remember the first time I got into MC. A guild on my server was looking for rogues to fill in some DPS spots. Requirements were the MC attunement and fire resistance gear. When asked about how much resistance I have I lied and than spent the next 45 minutes buying every okayish fire resistance gear on the AH. 
---
We killed everything but Ragnaros and I even got the T1 bracers cause no one else could need it. 
---
I never understood this mindset tbh. It's a progression no matter how you look at it. You got into this alien world with their superior technology (they certainly had more "fun" colours xD) and that's why you had let go of your goodies.
---
By the time of TBC release I was decked in 8/9 T3 and I was thrilled to get even better gear. I was so super happy with the Dungeon1 Set of TBC...
---
&gt;I missed connecting with people over mutural hatred for the other faction in our current zone. 
---
You know, say what you will about some of the people/guilds that you didn't like on your faction/server, but when it came down to it you were always friends when a few of the opposing faction came around. 
---
At least, in my experience. 
---
5 locks and 2 shadow priests, but only 3 rogues? That seems very backwards. Usually like 3-4 locks, 1 shadow priest.  The whole" heal your warlocks" idea is bad. 1 Holy priest will heal your raid better than 1 shadow priest. By the time you are dividing by 2x20 for ZG, keeping lifetapping warlocks alive is honestly a non issue.  Bump up the melee numbers, and you really don't need 5 locks.  You also probably want 1 more tank, although it could be one of your furys in tank gear.
---
Yeah that's true. It will be sad if it comes to a xfer, but at least you're not completely screwed forever. I did lose a bunch of alts that I had to relevel due to it.
---
Hey man. Try switching to elemental at 40, grab some eagle gear and dream weave gear for spell power and any nature’s wrarh gear. It’s the real way to play shaman once ur 60 when it comes to pvp and does well leveling when u find a friendly mage. I hate enhance leveling SO much that I respec at lvl 39 all the time when leveling a sham on a fresh server. Elemental is bursty, awesome in wpvp. And elemental mastery is an amazing skill for toasting ppl in wpvp when u get jumped. 
---
It’s also so much fun in bgs 
---
Surely this is something they will do, as they add in cross faction messaging.
---
I realize they have their place and can be impactful. But capping towers gets boring *fast* and rogues just can’t participate in big group fights since CDs are so long
---
LMAO
---
Farming Onyxia. 40 people go into onyxia, 36 drop group right before she dies including 1 melee and some other classes that want tier 2. Melee gets a weapon hopefully. Now 36 people can kill Onyxia again. 32 people drop group. Repeat every 3 days until every warrior/rogue has vis'kag/deathbringer/brut blade. With a competent team you can kill ony like 5+ times / hour, every reset.
---
You will have hundreds of hours spent on this character, play what you want. There are plenty of other ways you can outplay your opponents even without the racials.
---
I was a priest for one of the soaker groups and I just remember HAMMERING my Prayer of Healing button and watching boss HP, desperately hoping she'd die before we all ran out of mana haha
---
Ok, he brings up very good points. Now how do I make sure I'm not on a server with a high profile streamer? I guess there isn't really a way to be sure, so it's back to picking randomly from a list that will mean nothing at launch. Also makes this video completely useless.
---
Naw, in that guild Trials didn't get gear so I watched 3 pieces of Lawbringer get turned into shards instead of giving them to me lol
---
I took that last bit as we had one geared tank and a second tank who was half geared. Hence 1.5 geared tank. IDK if that's right or not.
---
There was Deadly Boss Mods, named La Vendetta Boss Mods back then. While it wasn't nearly as good as current DBM, it still did its job.
---
It also had auto turn-in for all items in AV. Meat, medals etc.
---
You realize all those “no-life losers” did the quest you’re trying to do now, but months earlier correct? Sorry you didn’t join the server when mobs weren’t being farmed for raid consumes as much. The blame is on yourself. 
---
There's honestly no chance devilsaur mafia's will be a thing in classic.
---
The only reason it's viable on private servers is because: A) Has massive population but same spawn time as retail. B) Huge china population that buys it regardless of cost C) Absolutely zero rules about cross faction collusion D) Global server meaning it's possible to have people playing at all times.
---
Classic will have none of those, just point A) alone, there will be so much leather in the game if it's farmed 24-7 that after a month or so all the required devilsaur has been farmed. And it's gonna be incredible hard to actually control it with low pop and region servers.
---
Sure you gonna have some contest on most servers at high pop time, sure there might be some people calling opposite faction once in a while, but it's not going to be remotely close to what private servers has it as. 
---
Can you point to these changes that occur "several times" in the tier items? There is one time that defense gear is nerfed that I know of and that is it.
---
Wow im surprised I have honestly never heard of this. Sincere thank you for the info.
---
you will get yelled at for being a healer, tank or dps.  anytime some one wants to shift blame to a faceless stranger and your name is in their group you will be yelled out.  the good thing is that it is just text and they are not yelling but typing in caps.  you will be spared the loud vocals of their voice.  most groups don't have caps lock ragers, but they exist in every online game, chat room, and forum.
---
I do have my healing kit, which is a mix of leather and cloth gear with Int on it. It should be enough for a switch, right?
---
I honestly see classic being a barren wasteland after 5 years. I'm sure they'll do something else with the game by then.
---
I completed everything in classic, I’m going back because it’s still the best designed mmo ever made, wow and mmos in general have gone downhill the moment we stepped through the dark portal.
---
I expect there to be new bugs and such that will pop up in classic which I am looking forward to
---
Also, this might be good for progression, but typically you can cut down on healers as they get geared.  With 13 healers, your dps will be less than optimal and your healers will be struggling to heal effectively since there just is too much healing and not enough damage being taken by the raid. They will likely get frustrated with someone always sniping their heal and start using their less efficient flash heal just so they can have an impact. This makees people play worse as healers overall and taxes your raid.
---
Warlock. They scale incredibly well and have fantastic solo capability. Talents like Emberstorm, Demonic Sacrifice, Shadow Mastery, or Improved Shadowbolt are all percentage based bonuses to damage, as well as having a direct percentage stamina increase in the demonology route.
---
Also, Soul Link is still a thing. You take soul link, master demonologist, healthstone, soulstone, spellstone, and 2x improved voidwalker sacrifices for the tankiest player on the battlefield.
---
Yeah. The only time I wont help someone getting ganked is if
---
A. I have no chance in hell of winning
---
B. They are asshole players that have personally done something to me that day. 
---
For the company It’s cheaper than firing them
---
Are you sure you don't mean Salvation? What the hell is Blessing of Sanctuary, some retail thing?
---
I can't specifically remember anyone farming those when I played, but I hardly even went through Badlands. Actually, I think I did that quest at least twice and never had an issue with it. I remember everyone saying those were good to farm to help get your level 40 mount. However, yes, there were copious amounts of gold farmers in the game. I can remember going to Hearthglen in Western Plaguelands and Tyr's Hand in Eastern Plaguelands, and there were multiple gold farmers at each location because they dropped a lot of coin, Crusader enchant, and random greens. Sometimes we would swoop in just to kill them and for the most part, they would just stand there and look at you and let you kill them without even attacking back. Then if you camped them or just killed them multiple times, they would start to fight you back. They didn't do much damage though. You could fight a few of them at once if you wanted to. They're gear was always bad, but just good enough to kill mobs in the zone.
---
We gave up on killing them after a while and just let other people go get them instead. After all, it was their job to farm gold there and they weren't going to stop for anything.
---
&gt;  But then the talents to get those 'enhancement' talent totems is gimping his build.  
---
Sure, but he's still a healer, allowing another real dps into the raid.  An enhancement shaman is there over a dps.  
---
&gt; IMO (and that's a key word here...this is my ideal raiding situation) a deep enhancement shaman with both wielding Nightfall axe is helping the raid in a lot of different ways. And before you start saying "but but...wing clip hunters..."  
---
You just said that your IDEAL raid comp includes enhancement, and then you IMMEDIATELY point out a raid comp that replaces the enhancement hunter with a higher dps, thus making it more ideal.  There's quite a few things that do more damage than enhancement.  
---
I'm not saying enhancements won't get raid spots- in practice, horde guilds tend to struggle to get the correct number of shamans, and they'll put up with an enhancement shaman because it will help than more than the other options available to them- but there's no room for them in some platonic idea of the ideal raid comp.  
---
In practice, offspecs will be in raids, but it won't be because they are ideal for the role.
---
If you are essential, you usually slack off eventually. 
---
If you are expendable, you will take the time. 
---
Couldn’t disagree more, my retail guild would accept only 1-2 new recruits at a time with a 1-2 week trial and many were cut. You can’t just let anyone in your guild if you are going for progression, that would kill morale and destroy the guild which happened to a lot of guilds on my server.
---
This was one of the few edges I had over other rogues leveling up, I always kept my lock picking at max level so I was able to get groups for SM, DM and Scholomance. 
---
https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?spell=20914
---
21 point Prot talent. 
---
Shamans and Warlocks are kings once people have Naxx gear. And T3 Warriors with dark edge of insanity are pretty busted too.
---
Do soul shards stack in classic? 
---
Have to bench because the RL play the same class as you and want the 2th part for TF and you got more DKP than him...
---
How hard is it to solo a devilsaur as a rogue? I used to do it all the time in my lock (wasn't even a skinner lol) just for the fun of it
---
But that's not the ideal comp.  Sure, it'll happen in some guilds, there's usually a highly motivated enhancementbro who wants to run and will be better than your other available recruits- but that's not ideal, and everyone knows that.
---
TIL people didn't have laptops or phones in 2004.
---
Also, built-in microphones in laptops were just as useless than as they are today. Get a headset.
---
Even my bottom-of-the-list guild had Teamspeak.
---
&gt; Are you talking about GearScore?
---
They are talking about Tier 1.5. Gearscore didn't exist in classic.
---
Why isn't Diablo 2 a barren wasteland? There's far far less content far far less reason to make a new character than WoW and D2 is still bumping. 
---
Why would they allow that? We’re supposed to hate each other not work together.
---
Thing is your pet doesn't scale, so people just kill them at that gear level
---
yes there were a lot of gold farmers in vanilla.  they were of all backgrounds.  the options for going around this molehill were skipping the quest or zone where you have having issues.  try to partner with them to complete the quest and then move on.  wait to log on to the game during a less populated hour.  reroll on a less populated server or faction friendlier server.
---
&gt; They are asshole players that have personally done something to me that day.
---
Yea, the really bad ones get ignored, but there were a few people on my server that I just found annoying that I'd try to avoid, but if they were in trouble I'd be there in a second. 
---
When all the melee have an alt to take to fill the raid, this can gear your entire raid in tier 2 helms/epic weapons in 1 week. You will also have Ony Heads on like every single person in your guild. Its great for early server when you only really have MC to raid anyways. Later on, your time is split between so many raids there is less time to do Ony.
---
Because there's nothing more. It's not an old game that was re-released... It's just an old game that still exists.
---
I met my wife on a Scarlet Monestary run in 2005.  Trust me I think a lot about how random realm selection is but how important it can be.
---
It's pretty easy unless the devilsaurs are on crossfaction collusion hardcamp.
---
I turn using my mouse not keyboard. /thread
---
What? 
---
World buffs don't pop in IF.
---
What's confusing about that?
---
Entirely different games and demographics and the only thing they have in common is the gear grind in which WoW handles in a more linear way. Diablo 2 is also less reliant on a large player base. 
---
Not sure why you think fake casting didn't exist in vanilla. 
---
problem is, you lose _exactly_ the people you want to keep with voluntary buyouts. 
---
When I started late 06 to early 07 there were tons of gold farmers. 
---
This is called server dedication 
---
Don't base anything off stuff you read from pirate servers. Devilsaur Mafia stuff won't exist in the real game.
---
Wtf are you talking about? 
---
So being a re-release will keep people from playing it? 
---
You dont think that when they announce at this upcoming Blizzcon that they remastering Diablo 2 for it's 20th anniversary, just like they did with StarCraft, that the people who play D2 now will play it? Huh?
---
The point was and still is if people are still grinding a 20 year old Blizzard game with no new content because of its gameplay then why wouldn't people do it with WoW being that there's more to do?? 
---
1) You don’t bring a trial into a progression raid unless you already know their general abilities. 
---
2) Just because they are in your guild doesn’t mean they are invited to every raid.
---
3) If you only accept 2 recruits, the likelihood that they are actually good is lower than if you accept 5 or 6. 
---
4) The more people you have for a single spot the more motivation you give to the people who could fill that spot. It’s about competition. 
---
I expect by that point they'll have come up with the "next step". Whether it's BC realms, or some sort of season system like D3, where they release new "season" realms and people level up and go through the whole thing again. I don't think in 5 years it'll just be sitting there as is.
---
You're comparing apples to oranges talking about D2.
---
This game will be fucking dead in 5 years you're insane to think otherwise. It's going to be hard for it to stay alive for any decent amount of time. 5 years is way too far out for it to be active anymore lol.
---
Runescape. 
---
For me it was the 30 core players and the revolving door of the other 10. And those other 10 would sometimes be quite good and would stick around but some were hot garbage and toxic.
---
I mean if you think about it, beginning in BC but becoming mainstream in Wrath, 10 people constitute a raid. You're constantly dealing with a revolving door of an entire raid's worth of people and there will never be a super smooth transition.
---
What about it?
---
I asked you why and you said literally a nonsensical sentence. 
---
Then I explain it further and ask what you meant and you just say it will be fucking dead and laugh. 
---
Try and keep up.
---
Sorry bro, Blizzard Activision is not in a great spot right now.  Overwatch is probably their healthiest IP currently (in terms of management and development), but it's not without its own struggles.  It's definitely legitimate to wonder about the future here.  
---
It's not like they're about to go belly-up or anything, but it's fair to wonder if the future of Activision Blizzard is going to bear any resemblance to the company we all grew to love over the last 20-30 years.  There's legitimate reasons to worry about the direction they're going.
---
What makes you think Naxx won't be available until 3 years after release?
---
I don't see how that's relevant here tbh. 
---
Funerals or similar ritualistic kinds of behaviour after a loss like this, wether it's burying a body IRL or playing a video game in a very specific way, are held to help the bereaved cope. The point is to find a vent to deal with grief, not to remind the entire world of someone and establishing a memorial.  
---
I'll always push back on addons like Decursive making the game too easy. Hell, the real problem isn't even Decursive, it's having raid frames that change color when people have debuffs on them and they light up or change color. 
---
Once people knew what the Lucifron curse mechanic was, it wasn't a big deal. It was that you'd have to keep mousing around the raid to find people to decurse and some people already had been decursed and others hadn't. 
---
Decursive simply gave you the same display that modded raid frames did, while saving you a click. It's not a big deal.
---
It was in the game late enough to be included in the manual and official guides
---
Probably a mix of private server loot tables on mobs being wrong, the hp/armor/resistance etc of mobs being guesswork, and people being clueless back in vanilla. But fyi tyr's hand is still decent to farm on private servers for crusader formula, or just for the increased chance of boe epics etc that high level elite mobs have. Also, they don't drop the same loot as the non elites around the corner, they drop a lot of silver /runecloth and have a higher chance to drop grey vendor trash/greens/blues/epics. 
---
That’s some shit
---
I can't argue with you because none of those games even compare to the complexity of wow and how important a huge playerbase is and how the servers and economy works.
---
I literally don't know how to respond to you. You can't make arguments about their other games and what else they're doing because it doesn't mean anything.
---
Okay that's kinda dumb. Like if anything, I'd think giving someone gear would make them want to stay with the guild. 
---
Also healers, I've found, are less toxic with gear than the dpsers so I can't imagine the worry if giving a holy paladin healing gear, fearing he'll walk, than it is for some guilds giving a Rogue the BiS dagger in MC and fearing he'll try to jump up to an AQ guild or gquit and PvP
---
I multiboxed 10 warlocks to farm eye of shadow from the demons in winterspring on Feenix Warsong for like 500g/hr, and thats literally the first thing I could think of while I was fairly new to the game... there are loads of things u can farm outside with 5+ characters that is impossible or very slow with 1, not my fault you don't know enough about the game ;)
---
And your PvP comment is just dumb.
---
Thats good to hear, maybe i'll get a bag addons as well. The OCD of bag management is my down fall in early levels with 6 slotters.
---
Yeah people really need to calm down about optimal specs and stuff. Just play what you want and if you want to kick down the doors of naxx with a dps core of exclusively fury warriors, combat rogues, and fire mages and then be stuck with nothing to do, feel free.
---
Good to know. I've been tinkering with PS macros but it sounds like it is a waste of time. Thanks!
---
Yeah they'll follow the money
---
I think the main thing that kills morale in a guild is toxic leadership, not liberal invitation policy. As long as there is clear expectations for the progression group that people understand before they jump into the group on raid night.
---
Ah, the Dirty Fifteen, wearing their Mauradon nature resist gear.
---
At least on the private servers they do not...Its not a huge issue as you normally only have a few but for quality of life improvement it would be nice to designate a six slot small pouch for direct shard placement
---
Yeah they have better loot tables. You can look up the mobs maybe on one of the classic databases.
---
Of note, I know they drop the enchanting formula for crusader, some choice blues, and have a higher chance to drop generic level 50+ greens.
---
Bro. You're Arguing about the comparison I made instead of explaining your lunacy.
---
I'm "insane" to think that the game will be "fucking dead" in a "decent amount of time."
---
Take your frisbee and go back to the dorm college boy if you can't even explain yourself and instead spit out sentence fragments like "I cant even..." 
---
So many fucking games still have large online communities that rely on item based bartering or straight currency based economies..... But forget those since you don't want to compare bananas and plantains.. 
---
Why will this game be dead on arrival? 
---
Enlighten me Savant. 
---
Good to know before I waste my time developing a ton of macros on PS. I think in classic it is the succubus quest that gives the soul shard bag, still trying to decide if its worth having a designated soul shard bag though....if I can macro a general use bag to share the same parameters as the soul shard bag that could be a solution
---
I feel like that part of BC is super salient for a lot of people that played but it doesn't get brought up as part of WoW's history. If anything, that transition was the single most socially disruptive thing that's ever happened in the game. 
---
Realms should be balanced at launch. It's only if something big pre-planned happens to a realm that it might skew it a bit. Like if a huge streamer brings half his followers there or something. But that doesn't reduce the number of the opposite faction, it just makes one faction bigger than usual. 
---
Retail realms are only unbalanced because of years of realm transfers. At launch, and during most of vanilla they all had fairly even faction balances. 
---
It can't be released right away can it? 2 years? 1 year? 
---
Doesn't affect the question asked
---
You'll be fine. The active racial also isn't useless at all especially if you use it well. It can really turn the tide in a duel where both of you are low and you start dishing attacks 50% faster. Troll regeneration also gives a minor decrease to your downtime.
---
1.5? It goes .5, 1, 2, 2.5, 3. There is no 1.5.
---
gearing people alts ahead of others mains
---
this is an area where classic wow is going to be much different than retail vanilla.
---
the top guilds on each server will easily clear mc, bwl, and AQ40 the first night it opens.  the amount of guilds that are able to clear all content will also be much higher than it was in retail vanilla.
---
Good insight, maybe one faction becoming huge or really small takes many many years to become that way like bfa today 
---
Have you actually lost your mind? What are you even talking about? I never said this game will be dead on arrival lmfao.
---
I'm sure this game will really popular to start out, numbers will die over the months after a huge chunk of the surge of players realize it's not for them or the grind is too much. Then once all the content is absorbed players will start to get bored. Sure, the game will be played by people, but it's not going to stay popular by any means 5 years into it. If it does well initially and the numbers start looking grim after a couple of years I'm sure Blizzard starts making changes or looks into bringing re-releasing other past XPACs.
---
But there's just no way this game is still surging with players after 5 years.
---
"fall behind", sure if you're playing the game for efficiency and what not. I'm playing casually so, not going to stress myself out over it.
---
I'll be waiting a month - I bet when I start playing, you may just be leaving the starting area with how packed the game will be.
---
There was an argument back in the day that they shouldn't raise the level cap and just progress the gear onward.
---
I think the worry from Blizzard was that gear would become this giant, insurmountable chasm. Half the playerbase wasn't even doing raids at this time, for context. And if you have these guys raiding Naxx and now doing even more advanced content, that gear gap is huge. PvP gets super busted, super quick, and a lot of players were casual PvPers and dungeon runners.
---
The move to 70 was a stealth reset, of sorts. If everyone moves to a new level cap and all the previous gear is invalidated, now everyone starts over at the same power level and you don't have as tremendous gap at the end of BC that you would have had if the level cap remained unchanged.
---
There's arguments for and against but I think it all worked out for the best. BC saw a much higher proportion of the player base doing raids of some kind and part of that was the accessibility of Karazhan and it only being 10 man. 
---
I'm on the phone so I can't find all the versions and I suck at formatting.
---
[Here](http://web.archive.org/web/20050207005939/http://wow.allakhazam.com:80/db/itemset.html?setid=203) is the release edition of the warlock T1 and [here](https://classicdb.ch/?itemset=203) is the last update of the set. As you can see there are plenty of changes, even the set bonuses change. I'm pretty sure that T1 is updated along the way as well. Warlock T2 is updated several times as well with both buffs and nerfs. I'm not exactly sure how the tier sets of other classes change but I'm pretty sure most of them are revamped at some point. 
---
I literally quit the game after clearing Kara a couple of times and our guild split within a week as most gquit to do 25man content rather than wait for others to catch up. There was poaching and implosions and it caused many of my guild to just quit the game 
---
This.
---
This is what made Vanilla Warcraft so popular. This visceral feel of kill or be killed. It made the world feel alive. It gave players purpose, it made the world feel alive -- and dangerous.
---
Your actions actually mattered and had an impact. You could easily spark a full on war in pvp hot spots.  That player and community content cannot be done in retail anymore.
---
OSRS nearly died a year after release until new content came out.
---
It was the best guild on the server, hands down, at the time. They had a real issue with people joining, doing 1-2 raids, getting 4-7 pieces of gear, then going "Hey thanks but imma go join my friends guild now!". It made sense at the time as it was VERY clear in the application process. 
---
on private servers in last years, healers are tbh overly focused on topping healing meters, to the detriment of the raid overall. Healers trying desperately to snipe other peoples heals so other people will overheal and fall on the meters etc. Hopefully it won't be so bad on classic. 
---
The people who say it will fail arent saying it will fail due to lack of interest, it will fail due to the people running it.
---
There are so many different reasons that people want this. I think that's why its so hard for others to grasp. There isn't one single unifying thing that anyone cant point to to explain why this is so big for people.  For me, I started with WoW Classic in 2005. I rolled a dwarf paladin, played all alone for several months and only got him up to like level 20. I wasn't having fun so I quit. I didn't come back until Wrath, when one of my buddies convinced me to give it a second go with his guild. Playing with friends was a whole new experience and I was hooked. Since then, all I have wanted is to be able to experience vanilla they way so many others got to. 
---
No.
---
Surging with players after 5 years? Move the goal posts much?? 
---
I asked what character will be the strongest once everyone has Naxx gear? If you want to yank on your weenis and feel smart with edgy retorts filled with everything except the topic asked then tweet at yourself. 
---
Even with what you just posted.. nothing about this post's question was even remotely implied or mentioned... Just you yanking on your weenis.
---
I said this game is basically dead in 5 years. Making your rhetorical question about the state of things in 5 years silly.
---
I want massive attunement requirements again. I want dungeons to be hours away from any flight path where you ran over mountains/rivers/deserts before you get to the entrance.
---
I think they removed /follow from bgs, i can' think of anything else.
---
If they spend 4k dmg on killing your vw and you just sacrifice it before it dies does it really matter that it does not scale with your gear?
---
While the succubus will be even easier to kill in post naxx pvp she was already something that most classes could burn down in 1 stun, rouges especially. I exceptionally seldom ran with a felhunter so I cant really comment on that. 
---
Rock and stone, brother!
---
Actually, that might not be so bad if the streamer levels offline on the PvP server and only logs in when they decide to do world PVP. Guarantes a big turnout.
---
Make them have to repay shards at least, that's silly ass shit.
---
Why would they prevent something that doesn't negatively impact the game?
---
Meh, I ended up becoming the 3rd or 4th best geared Pally on the server anyways.
---
On phone, so gonna keep it short.
---
In the perfect scenario i would want skilled people but no addons. So i dont disagree with you. The lack of Knowledge was great but people sucking for no reason and failing on same simple tasks got super frustrating. Today addons solve that issue mostly. I prefer no addons and better people 🙂
---
because they reset the ladder periodically?

Non Ladder is still bumping.
---
The cool kids getting their 10 man to clear everything while others were left behind. 25 mans and 10 mans really maxe me hate exclusion. At least you could raid in vanilla.
---
Dodged the question again to be edgy and try and look cool. What is that now 0-5? 
---
Thanks for your responses man, thanks for playing. 
---
Another reason to play a druid offtank, repair bills only cost 2 or 3 gold at worse.
---
What's keeping these top guilds playing if they can do everything easily?
---
I was a heal Priest and would duo Zul Gurub alligator packs with a Warrior friend for Bijou and Coins to sell. Worked out pretty nicely as I recall...we could clear all the packs in around 15mins and reset.
---
I remember the cap being 250 at one point, not sure if that was during vanilla or after.
---
I had a minimum of two soul bags at any time. One on me and one in the bank.
---
I only hope the progression rate isn't too fast. The trend on private servers currently is for very fast content progression because those servers exist to support an already hardcore or extremely knowledgeable  audience.
---
Classic servers will be loaded with players who have no such knowledge and will progress more slowly on average. New player numbers tend to decline on servers that have progressed further than others because those new players do nothing but play catch up with the bulk of the players raid logging and not helping lower levels as much. The AH market also slowly turns into a market for rich end gamers and twinkers.
---
What question? 
---
&gt;It's Been 5 Years Since Launch... Who Is Dominating..?&lt;
---
I answered it a few times. 
---
Your right about crusader but at least in my experience they the extra silver and other loot isn't so much better as to make up for taking longer to kill and longer to eat/drink between kills
---
Yeah if there's been a trend like that for awhile I can understand their hesitancy. But it still doesn't prevent someone who waited a couple weeks from grabbing gear and dashing later. 
---
I think it's inevitably a systemic problem with 40 man raid guilds. 
---
Hmmm yeah, forgot that unlike druid, warrior threat don't scale as well.
---
Should still be a decent increase tho.
---
I'm budgeting £20 for realm migration, kinda sucks but at least I have a plan.
---
&gt;I don't think in 5 years it'll just be sitting there as is.
---
Yeah, you'd be crazy to think this game won't need something to stay alive even a few years from launch.
---
Dude, more details please...! 
---
I am a Dwarf Hunter, it is not the best dps because night elf agi, and with night elf you can do some cool meld tricks.
---
But stoneform has been great for me for pvp, rogue bleeds / poison? nope. 
---
Druid bleeds or their one disease (I think it is a disease)
---
Warrior bleeds.
---
Undead priest thing.
---
Other hunter SS (Usually when they see SS not proc they thing it is due to a miss and will spam it a few more times wasting their mana)
---
If you are not that good at pvp like me, racials are a big boon.
---
I for one will be either going as a Dwarf Hunter, Priest, or Rogue in classic.
---
Warrior
---
Perhaps I'm buying into the generalization, but until we have precise data on the ages of players in all these games (which will be never) we can't make a precise judgement. I will say, from pure speculation, that younger players are typically the fastest adopters of a new genre of online multiplayer game. 
---
But my main point stands. WoW's peak happened not just because of the quality of the game at that moment in time but in the context of the gaming industry at that moment. Flame BFA if you want, you're probably not entirely wrong, but the truth of the matter is that MMO's are not the hot thing right now and that has huge impact.
---
Additionally, I don't think you get to call out circle jerk websites while citing your basis of thought on *checks notes* your friends? Alrighty then.
---
I’m sure I was in a guild with 200+ never seen one with 300+ and I played 05
---
Naxx patch servers die. There is no need to worry about the leveling life then.
---
The real meta of Classic is the Fresh/Old server cycle. It will also help Blizzard to add TBC progression as an option soon after the 1st wave of Naxx progressions while still nurturing Fresh Classic server rotation for new players.
---
I've said this countless times: The long term success of Classic Wow will hinge on Blizzard maximizing the life cycle of Fresh through Naxx patch servers. There are many ways to do this eventually. Launch as basically "No Change" (a f'ing myth of a concept but whatever) and then consider that best helps the game survive the server cycling that private servers have already been addressing in a few different ways ... but Blizzard has full development control over this product which could make all the difference.
---
&gt;Now how do I make sure I'm not on a server with a high profile streamer?
---
I'm guessing when server names are announced, people will start organizing and making lists of which servers a lot of the big streamers are going to be playing on.
---
Buy token/farm a lot of gold on bfa then find players willing to trade that bfa gold/token for classic gold.
---
definitely depends on class. As a hunter i had no problem nuking the mobs down, i could even take on 2 at a time no problem. But as a warrior it's gonna be terrible. Also as I said, the loot tables on mobs in private servers are definitely not correct. They might be very close, but they are not 100% correct. 
---
The two aren't mutually exclusive.
---
Having a slow on every attack doesnt care about gear.
---
You could use the same argument as an argument for picking the race you think looks good over a race you think is stronger.
---
Guild Wars 2 would like to have a word with you. It never raised the level cap and while it did add better gear stats wise, you are not leagues above normal people still.
---
&gt; this macro makes you keep only one soul shard at a time.
---
Completely wrong. This macro casts Drain Soul and deletes an item (in this case Soul Shard) that is located on the bottom right corner of the 5th bag. Given that the code runs immediately after starting DS it ensures that no Soul Shard lands in other bag than soul bag equipped in the 5th bag slot.
---
The people that have no desire to learn the content are free to form their own raiding guild. 
---
NZ plays WOW!
---
Naxx is the worst part of classic. When it drops people with demand the stuff get nerfed. Naxx gear ruins any semblance of fun in pvp.
---
Here we go again with massive changes to the game and calling it "quality of life". If you consider your life to have lesser quality just because you lack dual spec, you need to rethink your life.
---
not to mention the succubus is stealthed until you need her.  It really is underrated.
---
That was my point..? Adding dual spec is in no way a small QoL change. 
---
So here's the real kicker...
---
SHE HAD ME ON /IGNORE PRIOR TO JOINING THE GROUP.
---
Apparently I was "really annoying" in trade chat.  So yeah, got to give props to my guildmate who convinced her to take me off ignore so we could run the instance.  (He was a groomsman at the wedding 6 years later.)
---
Its not an attack at you m8, maybe get that stick out of your ass?
---
What even? This subreddit..
---
Then herb
---
How is this good recruitment when you have a single spot? 
---
How do you mean? Fairly sure most people in this sub don't like those features and have very good reasons to do so.
---
Try looking for engineering panels from BlizzCon on youtube. Invisible NPCs are a common subject. 
---
Not really, Vanilla rewards effort first and foremost so if you have better gear and play better the racials are not going to be enough to make up for the difference in dedication and skill. Play what you enjoy most.
---
I think they really should've kept the level cap, but not necessarily progress gear onward.  More of horizontal progression over vertical.  In vanilla there was gear at almost every part of end game that was still valuable even with bis gear.  Unique effects or procs and whatnot.  If they had released outland as more of an endgame zone without level progression, but instead other ways of progressing.  And then released some comparably hard, but different raids, as well as some harder than Naxx content, I think the game would've been much better.  But they were greedy and committed to expansions every 2 years.  This is all just my thoughts.  Who knows what would have happened had they not raised the level cap.
---
As a new streamer I cannot WAIT to stream on a pvp server... come try and kill me bitches! I welcome the challenge!
---
I  kind of have that no changes mentality, but i would love to see that implemented as a minor change.
---
yes, if you play the class well, the full blue pvp set and AV hammer would be just fine, and at some point around ZG, the set gets buffed. Also if you are tanking 5 mans and ZG, you'll probably some decent gear
---
&gt; Okay that's kinda dumb. 
---
It's also not true
---
Macros with a whisper to your assigned decurser/dispeller
---
I didn't speak about "my friends", which constitute less than 1% of the gamers I know, I spoke about **the gamers I know**, which are quite many.  
---
WoW's huge success was mainly because, at a time when people were crazy with EQ, Blizzard offered them "smooth and shiny EQ", where "smooth" means "more casual friendly", and "shiny" means "Blizzard polished".  
---
WoW started as a game for non-hardcore players, and it's a matter of fact that, tactics-wise, modern raid encounters are harder than earlier ones.  
---
The gear-treadmill began already in Vanilla, where encounters were basically gear-checks, and it's not an outcome of later expansions.  
---
BfA has many negative things, but to a casual player (the main audience for WoW since its inception) it still has lots to offer.
---
Guess I found the loser in his moms basement farming these things. There’s a difference, you dumbass, between farming mobs your own level at an appropriate area vs farming mobs 20 levels below you in an area where appropriate leveled people are farming/ questing 
---
Found another loser 
---
I think 321 is a MangOS core thing for private servers, and the number was somewhere around 200.
---
I'll have to try some of the old ones...  All of the new classic podcasts I've heard are very "Hey GUYS follow me on blah blah blah .. what's up guys? blah blah blah... garbage...."
---
&gt; deepest 
---
Doesn't say much in this universe
---
Wasn't talking about raiding. Was talking about pre 60 content.
---
If you want equal H/A ratio in a PvP server you should probably roll on a RP-PvP server.
---
This^
---
There is always ways to make it work. Now,  you could do this as a solo mage. But I don’t have time to lv 2 characters just to be able to farm something.
---
And it feels special doing it on your main anyways :) I just heal my tank friends and we make lots of money splitting the profits.
---
.... So what character will be the strongest?
---
I totally understand. I do that, actually. It’s just a problem for some people. Farming mobs 20 levels below you is just kind of shitty. Badlands is a lvl 40 quest zone - the fact that there are 50 lvl 60s in the area at any given time is just shit. 
---
I’ve done that. Nobody responds or cares. Just mercilessly pulls from one mob to the next 
---
(looks around) 
---
Delusional and dumb .. not a hill you want to die on but okay....
---
Thanks for playing.
---
The design change I slid in there is whatever. I don’t want shit to change either. Pretty much asking if anyone remembers this happening in classic. I’m not behind any curve either, I just really enjoy playing the game. But still, the fact remains that level 60s are farming in a lvl 40 quest area. Just seems shitty 
---
Yeah, I’m planning ahead myself lol
---
If there’s good profit to be made from easily farmable mobs, why would you expect higher level characters to not be there? There’s literally level 60 Alliance Hunters who hide somewhere around Sunrock Retreat and Eyes of the Beast to kill level 20 players that gain nothing from doing it, consider your problems small lmao.
---
No is is dominating, the games dead! LULW
---
At least it was a finished product, had good pacing of content and always challenging shit to do. Even if "new wow" isn't everyone's cup of tea, at least most specs were fleshed out and cool to play. 
---
The problem for me is that the entire game is meaningless to me in new expansions. I just do M+ and push keys and log off - it's like a fucking glorified lobby where the group finder/friend list is everything I need to do what's challenging. I've got no interest in the story, zones etc. For me, since the RPG shit is destroyed anyway and everyone walk around in ridiculous transmogs, they might as well just launch a competitive server where players like me (we are many) can create characters all with the same gear and just play arena and M+ on equal footing. So, so many find the rest of the game dull these days anyway. 
---
I don’t want any change, really. The post was more of a question if this happened back in vanilla. Because I can’t remember it.  I’ve asked people farming it, nobody will even say anything. Fact remains that level 60 losers are farming a lvl 40 quest area 
---
Pay close attention to the names of the realms. Names that are very closely tied to Alliance or Horde will usually be imbalanced in that faction's direction.
---
In Vanilla I rolled on Silver Hand and should not have been surprised to find Alliance outnumbering Horde 4:1, with Paladins being over-represented.
---
Maybe 1 year IMO, otherwise hardcore players would get bored quite quickly.
---
Yea that doesn’t work because there are 10 other 60s in the same area, so if I whispered one of them to stop, then the other 9 would just get the same mobs. 
---
I tanked Kara as a prot paladin, and did really well. We were one of the faster guilds on Underbog for a really long time (which was a dead server, so it's not saying much).
---
When we finally got to the library, we found out that blizzard had included mobs in the raid that were outright immune to spell damage. The wyrms leading up to netherspite.
---
I was told by my guild leader after that raid that I was to go holy to heal, as they couldn't afford to have a tank that couldn't do his job due to boss mechanics. If trash had that immunity, what's to say a boss couldn't have a phase like that?
---
I was a liability. Patch 2.1 was the last time I touched my vanilla character.
---
Druid. The great escape-artist, can remove all snares, got travelform and selfheals. And then stealth away from all that nasty pvp
---
My guess is Druid most likely. Stealth to avoid an engagement entirely, and kitty sprint and shifting to remove slows and snares so you can escape.
---
Druid for sure
---
Another nothing comment. I need some god damned meat lol
---
sounds good
---
we'll see.
---
Well they are saying the right things here.
---
....No..
---
So that's why I'm asking how expensive you think the set or mats will be.
---
It's as if they know they have fucked it up and are trying to slowly easy into saying that classic will be an activision shitfest and all the wait has been for nothing but disappointment. "How the team managed to solve some problems" Oh boy, here it comes
---
Probably Rogue (vanish, sprint), then Druid (also stealth, or travel form) because of stealth. Hunter would be the most situational aware class with Humanoid tracking though.
---
You trade them to the enchanter and trust them.
---
If they log off, bring it up with their guild, or name and shame them in /2
---
It's not really an issue.
---
Hi Ythisens! please show the guys [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/aoakvx/progressive_itemization_study/) and [this](https://itemization.github.io/).
---
You cant?
---
I trust the blizz staff with it.  I think there will be a few minor changes that this subreddit will rage about for a few weeks.
---
But overall, I think the game will be amazing. 
---
Shhhhh dont tell them that!
---
Nope.  Gotta trust the other person.  
---
Ive never once had someone steal from me in this way.
---
Orc rogues are fat
---
Nps I'm not basing my class choice of it, I just thought it was an interesting question.
---
I don't think people think Classic will fail, but they think Activision Blizzard will fail at making it.
---
That's my biggest issue with the game. There is no "world" anymore. And imo, it all started at the end of WOTLK when they implemented Dungeon Finder. It was a slippery slope and now look where we are.
---
True, but I do find the last "paragraph" really encouraging; it gives me some confidence that they're really trying to provide us with a genuine experience and not just throw something together for a quick cash grab. 
---
That makes leatherworking sound very nice :o
---
Thank you!
---
''confirmed'' lol.. just like the shaman and shadow priest reworks, kul tirans and zandalaris in 8.1 or the countless other things blizz has promised in the past 5 years lol
---
It would have been nice to see northrend as a 45-60 zone.
---
The issue, I think, is that if you have... what are we on, 8 expansions now? you can't just have 8 expansions worth of content at level 60. They would have to spread that shit out over 1-59 too.
---
I wish, and always have because I'm a twink player at heart, that some of these patches should have introduced lower level raids. 25 man raiding should have been a 20-55 thing with 56-60 being the 40 man stuff and 10 mans sprinkled . Are you going to be able to find 25 people at level 40 to do karazhan? Yea, maybe, because that shit would have been amazing. With how long it took to level back then, stopping for a few hours to go pug Magtheridon at 50 would have been a nice escape from the grind.
---
And As others have said, gear from lower levels was preraid bis, and even t1/2 bis, for all of vanilla. Capped players would still go do this stuff if the rewards were worth it.
---
Source?
---
Paladin for that bubble hearth ;)
---
From what we know, AV doesnt come with the release, so no mace.  and for a few monthes at least. same with pvp rewards.
---
[link](https://www.destructoid.com//ul/529812-blizzard-details-its-content-release-plan-for-world-of-warcraft-classic/W1-noscale.jpg)
---
warrior with the bad gear (in blues) is one of the worst classes you can play in pvp (i tried). its not like mages at all, mage is the most gear independent class in vanilla for pvp.
---
pvp gear and av mace is an ok setup to feel decent in pvp, but what you'll do until then? rank 10 takes monthes to get, and av won't be on release. the hardest hitting weapon you can get from nonraid content is Nicker and its still quite underwhelming even with it and got no stats on it also.
---
TL;DR the devs are passionate about the game and working hard to deliver an authentic experience. 
---
Still says nothing to compete with the thought that Activision will try to force a cash grab at the expense of game experience.
---
Or it's the other way around, taking their time getting things right. They could literally come out tomorrow and address Sharding and tell us they've removed it and people would still doubt the project.
---
If you're not worried about being called out, Paladin + Divine Shield + Hearthstone. 
---
i don't feel comforted by this.  
---
Rogue in AB almost made me main it, so fun
---
I'm surprised your wife didn't tell you what realm she was on
---
Not exactly. If you read between the lines it's basically saying that there won't be cash shops or other inauthentic things the community is so worried about. It's an "all but" confirmation of a few things. Calling it a "passion project" that is specifically intended for the "diehard classic fans" who have been asking for "a real Vanilla server for over 10 years" is very telling of their mindset.
---
I remember the elementals in various zones being camped for mates in vanilla. The earth ones in badlands, the fire ones in stonetalon, and the ones in arathi often had 1 or 2 60s farming them when I played. It was a weird design choice to have the low level elementals drop the same mats that high level ones do, and thats the problem.
---
It was no where near as bad as it is on the super high pop pservers. Im on a low pop pserver now and its a relief to be able to do these quests with no competition.
---
Yeah "this subreddit" won't be the players or anything...
---
I think the only way to possibly interpret these comments the way you have is to be unreasonable cynical. Like, there's cynical, and then there's your comment. People are determined to assume it will be fucked up by the big bad activision.
---
The last raid in vanilla is not going to be released in a year lmao. 
---
Do not care about being called out, didn't know that Divine Shield + Hearthstone still works in 1.12!
---
Warrior with nonraid PvP gear will be decent until BWL comes out. 
---
BWL introduces gear that is about as good as rank13 gear like Chromatic Boots, Draketalon Pauldrons etc. Ashkandi blows Arcanite Reaper right out of the water. 53DPS vs 81. pewpew
---
Any caster. The strongest being shadow priest. That being said plenty of people will argue Warlock and Mage. Any of the three though will be terribly deadly. Melee suck after AQ40. 
---
Well it's pretty obvious the game has been green lit under the understanding it delivers a boost to sub numbers and is (as far as anything goes) very easy and quick to develop. It really goes without saying you sell an authentic WoW experience by not doing micro transactions. The question is if for some reason it fails to deliver and the sub numbers aren't there then they probably will have to go to micro transactions f2p to try and get some value from it, like every other MMORPG in history that falls on hard times.
---
They'd be trashing their reputation for mere pennies, so I've never seen it happen.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/bluetracker?topic=94499&amp;region=us
---
Its awful. Thats the shit exploitative employers do and it kills morale.
---
Dont turn this game into a job.
---
They shouldn't waste time trying to appeal to hardcore players. They are hungry little monsters you can never really make happy. if they drop Naxx sooner then two years in they are being foolish. Classic needs to be digested more slowly.
---
sounds like a game that won't be ready in 6 months 
---
According to Wowpedia it worked until Cata. I know from personal experience it worked in Classic and BC XD
---
If you don't have a fellow guild member/friend that can enchant, then you'll have to go with a stranger. You can always take a screenshot of the trade/chat in case things go poorly, but that's not extremely reliable. Once you find an Enchanter that you can trust, add them to your friends list and solely use them for enchants.
---
Trade Skill Master
---
I think that's how the timeline is on a lot of private servers, at least the last one I played on. Even that was too slow for a lot of people and they quit before Naxx came out.
---
Not major, but noticeably significant. 
---
If you like Troll and aren't super hardcore just go Troll
---
Because he totally said that, yea? 
---
Is he saying that the fact that it is a passion project is enough too make Activision fuck off when it says to put in revenue generators?
---
Hunter against Mage = Mage freeze hunter and stands in Hunter's dead zone and casts freely on him.  I know because it happened to me on my hunter for every mage I ever fought.
---
I really hope they’re taking a good hard look at how Old School Runescape has had so much success while RS3 has been the brunt of MXT. There’s absolutely a model there to follow and work with, and I have hopes they understand that as well. 
---
No that's why you should pick the race you actually like
---
If you have 50+ members it's a lot easier 
---
Oh, don’t you worry...you WILL get stream sniped lol
---
Ythisens: Who wants to see how they restore silly old maps anyhow?
---
Classic sub: WE DO!
---
Ythisens: Who wants to see how we changed this slider to fix the placement on this fence?
---
Classic sub: MOAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRR!11!!1!1!
---
Only issue is you don't get the 12 second bubble untill a fairly late level iirc.
---
Well OSRS has been in this boat for a while and with Jagex being bought out by a Chinese holding firm awhile back it still doesn’t have any MTX with the exception of bonds which are a necessary component to battle some problems. If bonds weren’t successful I don’t think WoW would would have implanted them themselves. 
---
The game was incredibly easy, you didn't have to be good at it. That was what was amazing about it. We got to the four horsemen in naxx, the only thing stopping us was lack of tanks, half the guild were complete morons. 
---
If you aren't super hardcore, always pick the race you prefer to play as.
---
Also, Stoneform is legit anyway and Treasure tracking will help a little to level lockpicking.
---
the last sentence he hedges his comment "the team is dedicated to trying to pull it off" emphasis on trying.  Why doesn't he say "the team is dedicated to pulling this off" it has the same meaning but without the hedge.  He isn't confident they will pull it off from what he's seen.
---
&gt; It's a passion project for you folks that have been diehard Classic fans and have been asking us to provide a real Vanilla server for over 10 years.
---
It's a passion project for *US* guys! They just don't want to share any information until it'd be too late to do anything about it. Top secret project here. 
---
Make the run to goldshire in nothing but whites and mismatched gear with the music cranked for my full 2005 experience 
---
Shiiiiit honestly I’ve never given thought to a D3 Season way of going about it. After the normal servers have run for a while and are fully progressed and beyond, having some separate realms drop with a quicker progression style (as in, raids release quicker, to shorten their life cycle) that go on for a little bit and eventually have your character merged into your normal character list? Maybe even some type of seasonal journey rewards. That’d be pretty sweet, and a cool way to have people play other classes.
---
speed clears, speed kills, and dps/hps records. 
---
they will min max the game to the fullest and fight over records.
---
Gear 
---
It wont be a majority, or even a large minority, of the players playing.
---
yeah this is only from the pov of the devs unfortunately
---
The vast majority of people will not break your trust, but if they do:  
---
It breaks the game rules to violate a written agreement so if you say "I'll give you the mats and 1g if you enchant my bracers with this enchantment" and they say ok then when you trade the mats they are required to give you the enchant.  If they don't you can submit a GM ticket and they will resolve it.  That's at least how it worked in vanilla.
---
The spammable auto guild invite
---
Well I'm glad the paid community manager is hyped, really reassures me as a paying customer with -10.000 faith in Activision (Blizzard).
---
Ditto, I used to farm it on my hunter in vanilla with no trouble.  Dont fully remember though, didnt they also drop righteous orbs?  Or was that only strat?
---
Didn't classic have the enchanting window in the trade menu? Was that introduced in TBC (when I joined)? If it was there in classic, then enchanters will usually have the mats prepared, and will trade you the enchant for the mats used + the gold.
---
I think them referring to it as a PASSION PROJECT is really good news.
---
" I totally get the concern, but to comfort the thought that comes with that, this isn’t a normal project. It’s a passion project for you folks that have been diehard Classic fans and have been asking us to provide a real Vanilla server for over 10 years. "
---
I don't think they realize how anal some people are about the tiniest things and how much private server players demand private server changes 
---
Show them the game.  Tell them what you love about it.  Let them play it.  Tell them to take their time and enjoy the ride.  That's all you can do.  The more you try to force it the less they will enjoy it.
---
slower progress will kill the servers.  this will even happen with newer players.  
---
your classic servers will have all of the knowledgeable pserver players and they will end up schooling the new people on how things are done.  
---

You know you can just call it ganking right? :p
---
I mean, I see why you're coming to that conclusion but I think you're reading too much into it. I'm not throwing shade btw, hence my first statement, but maybe it's just the way he talks/types? Like, I use too many commas and add words when they're not needed, maybe he does too? 
---
Regardless, at the end of the day, they're trying, and that's all that I ask. 
---
5 mage or 5 ele shamans 
---
World buffs. Pointless busywork, that makes no fucking thematic sense.

Aragorn didn't travel around Middle Earth, picking flowers, so he could get buffed up, before the Battle of Helm's Deep.

Were there realm transfers back then? I cant remember 
---
Things I like about the macro:  It makes improved drain soul far more manageable  
---
Things I don't like about the macro:  It deletes a soul shard even if you don't end up getting one.  Fat finger the button? Shard gone.  Mob didn't die or you got interrupted? Shard gone.  Not a big deal once you learn how to manage it but I wish there were a better way.
---
The "Will not be traded" window is there but from my experience enchanters will usually expect people to bring their own mats.
---
you would take thunderfury from your main tank?
---
Right. 
---
We'll see though, I think that if Classic WoW is successful (and if I were a betting man I'd wager it will be) I think that following the Runescape model would probably be the best way to 1. keep and/or expand the player base and 2. ensure long term profitability.
---
But we'll see, as much as I'm hoping for that I'll settle with just getting the game if I'm being honest. 
---
stuff like DBM are the cancer of wow.  
---
What minor changes are you expecting them to make?
---
Yeah, I think this as well. If it is out in 6 months it's not going to be as clean or as polished as we expect a Blizzard launch to be. Time will tell but usually we're already pretty much in the know when Blizzard is within a 6 month window.
---
I played shaman and warrior in PvP during vanilla. Shaman is a lot of fun, but enhancement is PURE DOGSHIT.  Wear a shield and nuke and heal. You will get invited to WSG farming NP if you play like a good hybrid doing mostly heals, dropping WF and putting out some shocks. In fact a lot of melee were bass that could be easily kited with Earthbind and frostshock. It’s not a GREAT class but it’s good. 
---
I always thought paladins with T2 looked sick AF, and most were just unkillable warrior assistants...but more often than not...Pally wore cloth dresses and healed and bubbled then when their CDs were gone, they’d easily get smoked by mages and locks. In fact, IIRC, mage interrupt even kept them from being able to bubble.  And TRUST ME, there will be a METRIC FUCKTON of Undead Mages in classic that know WTF they are doing. 
---
Pick your poison: shaman dies easily to rogue, pally to casters 
---
Yeah, this has been my ideal solution for quite some time now. It allows you to keep your initial character and progress, but also incentivizes you to start all over again from time to time and keep the game alive.
---
Think about how many times people have leveled up and raided or PvP'd in classic on various private servers. People are willing to start over again from scratch for that new experience. It was also super popular during '04-'06 when people were always clamoring for new servers. Everyone loved the idea of starting over on a fresh server and doing it again. It seems to fit the player base very well, and it extends the life of the game (and in turn subscriptions).
---
Yes, paid, I think so anyways.
---
If the enchant is rare, they'll make more money by being a trustworthy crafter than they would stealing mats, if the enchant is common, you can find someone you personally trust to make it.
---
Spammable auto guild invite blocker
---
he got full world buffs for the battle of the Pelennor Fields
---
Having the token and less gold sellers and therefore botters is only a good thing.
---
It won't be as big a deal as you think, assuming it happens (which it still may not be purchasable on Classic anyway)
---
Some games just aren't for some people. Trying to get an RTS friend into an FPS, for example, usually doesn't go well and its the same for MMOs. 
---
The best thing I find to keep friends invested in a game is to continue playing it with them, and I know that's a forgone conclusion for people here, but most people will choose playing a game with a friend and not by themselves if they can. 
---
I plan on having alts for those friends who aren't able to play as much as the others so they don't feel left out as much. 
---
The only problem with druid is they rely on cat form to quest with any efficiency, and they are often dropping down to &lt;50% life just in the normal course of killing quest mobs which makes them an easy target for anyone that can sneak up to them. A good rogue for example can easily gank a druid questing endlessly for example, whereas that rogue will have a very hard time getting a kill on a mage/hunter.
---
The only surefire way is to get the chant and trade the Mats in the same window, using their Mats first and replacing them. 
---
But most people dont do this 
---
Take a screenshot with the chat between you two and trade window window open with mats and money and then just make a ticket with a gm.
---
Premade group finder 
---
they removed it from retail for a bit but people complained. pretty it currently works on retail to this day
---
The enchanter has to have the materials in order to actually apply the enchant to an object in the trade window. The game won't look at the stuff being traded and check if that gives the enchanter the materials, as far as I can remember.
---
Right, but I am saying the enchanter would carry the mats for the enchant, and then the person buying the enchant would also supply the mats. The enchanter loses no mats, but gains gold. The buyer loses mats and gold, but gains enchants.
---
Dire Maul on release, isnt people complaining about this?  
---
It basically makes content like LBRS never touched
---
Being a bit more interested in progression than the rest of the guild and showing up with extra pots, flasks and food " incase someone forgot".....
---
I have been an enchanter in retail since 2006 and can count the number of times I sold an enchant that I had the mats for on one hand.
---
What? It launches with BWL/MC, and about the longest you could possibly wait between content patches would be 3 months, otherwise you'll just lose all your game's raiders from sheer boredom. There's no way Naxx won't be out and cleared within 12 months of launch.
---
He only got one, that was only slightly out of his way to the encounter.
---
they don't drop righteous orbs, those are indeed only from strat
---
Oh man do I miss “classic” WoW!!!
---
Rogue, vanish, evasion, sprint. Blind.
---
Lots of tools to avoid and get away.
---
Not the commenter, but I fully expect that there will be a long tail of minor unintentional changes. I also expect that there will be post launch patches to address them.
---
I really think people upset about the things Blizzard has talked about to cut operating costs (sharding, loot trading, and other modern CS stuff) is self-destructive for Classic. We have to be able to give on some of these non-game breaking things in order to help the Classic development team stave off the Bean Counters. Because you know once Classic launches and everyone is feeling great, some Activision accountants are going to start looking at the bottom line. Sure there will be the bump in subscriptions numbers but after the first year or so they will want more. So the lower those operating costs are the better for us in the long run. If that means we have to put up with some limited sharding to make sure the server pops are healthy, so be it. If that means loot trading and other self-service systems like in UI reporting features, so they don't have to have a large CS staff, fine. Because the alternative is that the accountants start demanding the things that will break the game, like gold tokens, level boosts, and store mounts.
---
I wouldn't murder him for his comment, but yeah he didn't answer the question you proposed hahah
---
Paladins are pretty absurd kitted out. They can put out a lot of healing with literally 0 mana usage.

We already know that the debuff limit is 16 from the get go, and that loot trading is a thing. I expect similar changes in the same vein, like the option of not having an auto loot key assigned and thus auto looting everything automatically instead of having to hold down shift.
---
One can also wonder what is a change now and what will be a change three years down the line, but time will tell when it comes to that.
---
Not a wife, but I met some of the best friends I've had in life (and still do) by random server choosing luck
---
You cant really. Not that i play current wow, But i guess that if classic would have the same sharding and mixed servers as current it would be a real problem. since there is no real sense of community. But if classic ends up as in the old days, stealing is a big no no and can damage your reputation with the community.
---
Story time: the Heroes of the Storm developers would post in their sub reddit almost weekly.
---
Multiple skins, references, and even heroes where release with the feedback from and as a nod to the HotS fan community.
---
It was clear from everything the HotS devs said ended that they were genuinely and creatively passionate about the game.
---
**Then stepped in Acti Blizz management.**
---
Literally most developers we're moving away from the project.
---
Hero and skin release schedule was slow down to a, I shit you not, "a more sustainable pace."
---
And the final kick in the nuts, despite HotS devs literally the week before talking to players and professionals saying that the pro league would be bigger and better next year and they were very excited for it,
---
out came a letter from the management brass saying that they would be *completely and utterly shutting down everything related with the pro league effective immediately*.
---
The pros, the devs, not just the players, everyone was surprised by this. They admitted it themselves.
---
The passion was in the project. It wasn't a lack of passion. It was the inclusion of the soulless corporate direction coming from Activision.
---
It doesn't matter how much I trust the Classic devs' intentions.
---
I know that they have limited power against Activision's cost cutting measures like not employing GMs to the extent a, at the time, smaller company it's more than a decade ago.
---
I know they have limited power in getting Activision to invest in server structure that is superior to the current retail WoW, which lags and has less simultaneous capacity than decades old server blades.
---
I know they have limited power to do things that really matter like limit the guilty before proven innocent, automated right click ban system which only involves human GM involvement after an appeal and that's only after you have already been logged out and kicked.
---
I have absolutely zero trust in Classic. You say you treat this as a passion project. You think you do, but you don't.
---
*I'll see it when I believe it.*
---
Had a full set of T3 and random nonvisibles as a Prot Tauren warrior w/ Thunderfury and AQ40 shield.  
---
Flag Carrying in WSG was a joke, as long as there was one healer that figured out to spam me I essentially would just soak the enemies teams damage while they died to the rest of mine.   AV was pretty similar, dive into objectives and just make myself huge and annoying, its hard to ignore the giant cow in black skull armor with a thundersword.  
---
It was fun, sure, but competely busted.  I imagine DPS warriors had even more fun with stuff like corrupted ashbringer.
---
There were free 1-way transfers during vanilla from overpopulated to underpopulated realms.
---
"This subreddit" was a more accurate representation of the intended playerbase when it was under 5,000 subs. It's been a shitshow of big mouth tourists for months.
---
Wow this is amazing work! How didn't I see it before?
---
I would not play a warrior. If you are even questioning whether or not you should play a warrior. I wouldn't. They are the most hard core class. They are also the most over populated class. They are also the class with the most dedicated disciples. If you are planning on a playing a warrior. You need to be willing to work harder then R10 if you wanna pvp.
---
I would recommend you stick with casters as they are far less hard core in classic. I you don't want to cast. Hunter does a pretty good job walking the line. If you go into warrior with a half ass attitude. Don't expect anything other then half ass results. Not trying to hate thats just how warrior is.

Paladin, and by far. Bubble and hearth, even if it's insanely lame. I personally hated all the paladins who did it and boy, they were many...
---
Passion project or not, they *are* making it for one sole purpose: money.
---
If anyone thinks a company like Activision-Blizzard would sink a lot of money and years of dev team work into project that is not profitable, they're delusional. So this really doesn't mean that much.
---
Yeah I want to be optimistic about it too!  I've read a lot of these types of comments over the years from various developers and community managers and this one is making me feel like they are 'managing expectations'.
---
Thanks for a great reply. You make excellent Points. What I like so much about warrior in battlegrounds with pocket healer is that you have rage instead of mana. I love mage for wpvp but in battlegrounds i find them kinda dull because of drinking and being a cc bot / peeling. WArriors just keeps going.
---
I dont care so much that I need to blast someone in the face right of the bat. If you have enough HP along with a paladin that knows how to play you can simply outlast most battles when you dont meet geared premades.
---
It's more about the resource system and kinda lazy playstyle, being a casual with an OP combo that appeals. This is why my question included the paladin aspect. Mage is Amazing but you need to be so damn alert all the time because the defensive aspect is not just a nice hp pool but reactive spells such as iceblock.
---
But you do make me rethink it, because again your Points are very valid.
---
Followup question. Consider what i just wrote is the damage output still to weak for a warrior being a nice choice?
---
It was either 250 or 500 if my memory serves... I almost was sure it was 500, but other comments here make me question that.
---
Heroes of the storm was also a "passion project" .... 
---
Gimme an addon like a PokeDex that tracks all the mobs I've killed.
---
Adding those "revenue generators" will drive away most of the Classic fans who don't already pay a retail sub. And those "lost" subs is why they are releasing Classic in the first place. 
---
No point for them to add such stuff. 
---
Pls no sharding
---
Yea people complain about it.  
---
Personally I don't think it's a big deal.  DM was out before most people hit 60 anyways (and before EU release at all).
---
I have been an enchanter since TBC. My point is you will get more customers if there isn't the risk of being scammed. I use to farm enchanting mats, so I could craft pretty much everything I had known.
---
This is good and all, and I have no doubt that the devs are dedicated to making classic as authentic as they can. But, Activision has the final say, so everything he says to try and reassure us, it doesn’t mean much because of the higher ups in Activision.
---
Yeah, that kind of stinks. For moments like that I might log off and log back on at a different time. Sometimes maybe even logging back on past midnight or really early in the morning.
---
Exactly what I said, I 100% agree. We need to here the higher ups at ActiBlizzard say they won’t monetize classic at the expense of its authenticity, if not I will believe it when I see it
---
People always forget this. OSRS, at launch, plateued like a motherfucker. 4 months post-launch and it barely had 5 figure players active at once. It took the GWD update+ for it to claw it's way to the top over several years to really only *now* is it starting to outnumber RS3 in players, 5 years post-release with *tons* of additional content designed with an oldschool mindset.
---
Ythisens is really not a good writer at all so it's probably him fumbling over his words
---
Plenty of games attach effects to an anchor point. Its nothing new, like in Fallout 3 the train is just a character model with the train car as a head.
---
I pray with every ounce of my being that you are correct. But does Activision see it that way or think that way, idk.
---
&gt; lots of rogues got perdition and still sucked in PvP, still got countered by mages and the like. 
---
I agree that this is possible, after all, skill &gt; build &gt; gear.
---
&gt; This is mitigated by the fact that it takes TONS of MC runs before you build up enough dkp for Perditions or BRE and the drop chance is annoyingly low. 
---
Yes, it is hard to get Perd's, CHT, and ACLG in a small time span with drops &amp; rolls (or DKP) needing to be in your favor, and not in the multiple other dagger rogues.  
---
However, if you got them, have a high skill for your class, and a solid dagger build, you would notice a vast difference in DPS, and your killing potential in pvp. Much *more* than you would see in other expansions with such few items. Classic raid gear was far too good.  
---
Lol.
---
I guess you don’t understand how consumables work. Please go play retail, bud. 
---
I expect to hear that a lot come tomorrow lol
---
&gt;5 weeks
---
You bring in 5 mages for 1 mage spot. At least one of those mages will know they are good enough to beat out the others and they will. It really doesn’t matter about the feelings of potential raiders when your goal is for the whole raid to be successful.
---
Can you elaborate on the melee drop off??
---
I've heard Warrior with Naxx gear is unkillable and rogue's auto attacks are op? 
---
I'm not disagreeing with you just intrigued at your answer
---
Exactly. 
---
You can’t. 
---
What you can do is limit the risk of it happening by getting the enchant done by a friend/guildie, or a trade chat enchanter from a decent guild. As long as you don’t trust the guy in greens/blues to have a raid recipe, you should be fine. 
---
Almost certain they’ll shard the early zones for the first couple weeks. I would rather they didn’t but I’d be shocked if it didn’t happen. 
---
I remember auto looting was a thing in vanilla. Was it not? Or am I confusing it with early TBC?
---
Early TBC!
---
Flexbar
---
Gearscore, some sort of boss kill tracker, perhaps ways where ppl can be forced to show you they have completed a dungeon very fast without mistake.
---
In general addons that just allow me not to play with ppl that suck.
---
In all seriousness, none of the above please.
---
What? You are delusional if you think the GM will assist you with that.
---
Pick a race with a good racial, use noggenfoggers.  Win.
---
Doesn't the new crafting UI make it so you don't have to trade the items?
---
I'd like to see character transfers. In this day &amp; age, everyone wants to add micro-transactions... Well, here it is. $5 per character,  $20 per 5 characters, something like that. I wouldn't be opposed to that, &amp; it essentially allows you to continue playing both games. You can complete the game on one character, without compromising the experience on another. It's also a great way to force yourself to do all the content.
---
Not gonna lie but that's like you saying you think the sky is blue
---
i'm not sure about others, but when I made someone bubble hearth it was way more satisfying then just killing them 
---
Ah ok Nvm I think I misread your comment but okay thanks!
---
It overtook RS3 almost four years ago, two years after launch.
---
They can waste their time doing it if the Vanilla servers remain, while new content or expansions are released on new servers.
---
If I can totally speculate:
---
No more dismounting in water
---
Auto-dismount upon casting spells, etc. (most people use mods for this)
---
Mob HP will be shown
---
Some extra cosmetics available
---
And (this would ruffle feathers for the PvP grind bros) separate queues for premade BG groups. Blizzard would probably rationalize this with some other small changes to the old PvP system.
---
It won't happen very often but it is possible. Best thing to do if you're worried is go through a guildy or someone who is spamming in trade. If you have to seek out a random, don't do it with a super expensive enchant. Put people you find and trust on your friends list. And if you need to get a very expensive enchant, don't randomly give someone you don't know 100g in mats unless they are one of the above or a member of an established guild. And don't trust unguilded alts. 
---
It very rarely happens but the above will help give you peace of mind. 
---
I have done it before and gotten my items back, it's scamming and the evidence is in chat records they can easily access.
---
Care to elaborate? Shadow priests are easily the worst scaling caster DPS and one of their important tools mana burn doesn't scale at all with +damage gear.
---
Yes. Every raider whose had to play through it. People seem to forget this but Nost's only player slump and decline was when we had just MC and the awful god damn pre 1.5 itemization. It wasn't harder, it wasn't challenging, it just made everyone feel like raiding was a waste of time.
---
On blizzard servers during retail vanilla?
---
Druid and Rogue.
---
MobInfo2
---
Molten core will be easy as hell with or without it dude, gonna have to face that reality.
---
You either trust them and it works out.
---
Or you shame/troll them as much as you can
---
Enchanters advertising enchants in major cities need to just be carrying enough mats on them to handle any regularly asked for enchant, that way the trade window only needs to be opened once and neither player needs to worry about being ripped off. Player supplies fee+ mats in trade window that replaces the enchanters mats, and enchant is handled at the same time. Ez pz.
---
Druid is the best at running away from ganks. 
---
Hunters are the best at avoiding ganks in the first place (minimap tracking+hunters being broken until 60). 
---
Mages and rogues have great tools to escape ganks: poly—&gt;run and vanish. 
---
Paladins can bubble hearth but not until level 40-50ish as bubble doesn’t last long enough until the last rank. 
---
Hunter, hands down.
---
Orcs are better for PvP, Trolls are slightly better for PvE if you're using a bow, but if you have a gun or xbow Orcs are better.
---
trolls get haste and +bow skill
---
Orcs get bloodfury + pet dmg
---
Especially when he's already got 1 binding.
---
4pc T3 so you get the taunt set bonus will prevent four horseman wipes. 
---
They could literally show a screenshot of like Arathi Highlands in progress and it would be the top post on this sub for a week. 
---
Oh man the good old days.  The first time we killed Garr we did so with a warlock for each add.  Our job for the whole fight was to just keep the adds banished the whole fight.  I developed a method of using rank 2 banish then spamming rank 1 banish so if it breaks early you get an instant re-banish on the add without wasting mana (it says a more powerful spell is already active and won't let you cast it)... what a blast of nostalgia, lol..
---
My plan is to wait it out. Waited this long, I can hold off a bit and see how things shake out. I may make a few characters and scope out a few servers I'm interested in, but not invest too much time as to feel tied down to one option until I'm sure it looks sustainable (as much as I can). 
---
understanding hit boxes
---
Tough luck, and you didn’t run into the dominant faction’s rankers roaming in gank squads in lvl 48-59 zones ganking the shit out of every single lowbie they find for honor between queues. 
---
Earth eles in the Badlands are only farmed for a specific time frame in the server’s life. Get better at tagging or skip the quest if the other faction is there. 
---
Nope. That's how it worked 
---
Go to a trusted enchanter with a good reputation.
---
Sharding during starting areas in the first couple of weeks.
---
Simple rule:  only give the mats to people you already trust, or to people from well established server leading guilds. (and the latter you can always ask others from that guild if person A really has that raid enchant) 
---
In many years of playing this has never been a problem for me. 
---
It most definitely will be, but not for the majority of the WoW Classic population.  Gaming subreddits are usually filled with more of the hardcore and dedicated gamers rather than the casuals that play. 
---
Not really a change but the main thing I'm not going to trust them on is server stability when more than 50 people are in the same place/zone. From what we've seen in BfA these situations causes massive lagg and makes the game unplayable.
---
Oh I’m actually very qualified to answer this question!! (Made top 10 arena teams in BC, played through vanilla)
---
So I basically ran a round in rank 10 gear, exalted BG gear, and some MC/ZG gear (like zinrokh, but I used unstoppable force for very long).
---
As shown in my success in BC soon after, I was very good at PvP.
---
I could beat a lot of geared players because I was just straight better then them.  You will be complete garbage until you have decent gear first off. But once you get what I listed above, it’s def a fun and viable class where you absolutely can blow up other players.
---
But I will tell you how you’ll end up feeling once people are Naxx geared: they will destroy you unless they blow ass. Luckily in vanilla retail, most raiders were clicking wsaders. Nowadays I wouldn’t bank on that
---
Basically it goes like this:
---
Naxx destroys you always
---
AQ40 gear is manageable but it’s absolutely noticeable how strong everyone is.
---
You can compete with BWL gear. 
---
Anything lower you are completely fine.
---
There you go. I still loved playing warrior but I was always mad that shit geared players would destroy me and taunt me on forums( I was always around the world killing people). Needless to say, when BC came out, my ranks proved them wrong and it felt so good.
---
What I took from it is that the project is small enough that the bois up top aren't influencing the project in the same way (or at all) that they might for a large title like the next WoW xpac or another new game. Bigger fish to fry kinda thing. I'm just pulling this out of my ass though so I could be completely off the mark.
---
A lot of games do this. IIRC league of legends used teemo as a placeholder for many things. Jayce's acceleration gate was just a line of teemos. I always find these things super interesting. 
---
A lot will depend on whether they retune MC/Ony for 1.12 talents and gear.
---
I strongly suspect a major reason pirate server guilds crush T2 and T3 content so easily is that T1 is a joke with 1.12 mechanics, so everyone is geared as hell when T2 opens and so on. If T 1 was actually hard there would be far fewer people in MC/Ony BiS when BWL opens.
---
Nothing you said I disagree with, but still only citing the people you know is a bad habit.
---
Pauline Kael was one of the earliest of Hollywood film critics to gain repute as a woman and had a storied and successful career. Nevertheless, the only thing she is remembered to have said was, in response the results of the 1972 US election was:
---
"How could Nixon have won? Nobody I know voted for him"
---
It's actually thoroughly misquoted and she did not say that, but there's a lesson in that even the sentiment of the misquotation has lived on for many decades later.
---
Additionally, and this is my own hill to die on, calling Reddit a circle jerk is a meaningless phrase. It says nothing. It's intellectually lazy. There's enough people on the internet and on Reddit to vote up two opposing posts to the front page of any subreddit. Big shock: people will read and upvote things they like and not read or upvote things they don't.
---
Also have a good day, I think I'm sounding more prickish than I'd like.
---
So you are saying that you want changes, again. Single target buffs never required reagents in the released game.
---
On top of the expensive mats that you must provide, they'll usually charge a small fee to actually perform the enchant, which is usually exchanged when the item is being enchanted in the trade window.
---
Having a good reputation and availability is far more profitable long run than scamming 2-3 people of their mats.  
---
Prot pally can aoe tank trash for farm/gold and just bubble hearth if ganked in said process.
---
My sister, who plays games much more regularly than I do and is currently subbed, has no interest in going back to classic. When we talk (about anime, books, games etc) and it comes to WoW I sometimes talk about classic stuff bc it's what I'm interested in. She played back in the day (we both did, sharing our dad's account) and she might think it's interesting or funny some of the stuff you could do back then, but she's pretty into the present game and has no reason to switch over. My brother and dad also both tried private servers at different points but gave up some time in.
---
Really, talk to people you're friends with about it - not to recruit them, but because it's something you're interested in and it's normal to share your interests. If they're interested, that's great, and if not, that's also fine. MMOs in general are hard to get into, and it's not going to be any easier when someone is nagging you into playing.
---
Dude what? Druid questing is insanely good, and if you are hopping in and out of forms you are constantly throwing HOTS on yourself. You are killing mobs so fast that you rarely drop below 3/4ths, yet are still out-pacing everything that isn't a Hunter.
---
I love the pseudo intellectual conversation between the two armchair philosophers around the 14min mark. Quality cringe
---
You scared me for a sec
---
Druid, followed by rogue.
---
Can't gank someone who's invisible.
---
Druid has more escape options, but rouges with blind, sprint, vanish and such can get away from quite a lot, too.
---
Starting zones at launch, I’m ok with.   I’d rather not any other sharding.  
---
I think the people who are upset about that see things the same as you, and they just draw the line in a different spot. For me personally sharding will break the game because thats what I love about vanilla. Running into that same person again the next day in the same spot you were last time. Little experiences like that. And the Loot Trading too, I feel like we already see enough toxicity on private servers with dalrends UBRS runs that if we add a whole system which literally allows trolling then we are already giving up those things that you say will break the game, since that line we drew was in a different spot. Especially if sharding is used for more than just starting zones since the sharding will allow people who abuse loot trading to get away without consequence. Hard to get blacklisted if the population is so high that you cant even see the guy standing next to you anyways :(
---
Orc and Undead both have racials that make them a nightmare for certain classes, where as troll has berserking for PvE or for damage increaseses for builds that rely on white damage (i.e. combat).
---
For solo play and PvE troll is fine.
---
I agree. Druid is one of the best if not the best. You also have an easier time leveling compared to a lot of other classes. Entangling root is amazing for removing an enemy from the playing field and you have self heals, mobility, stealth... For gank resistance while leveling, Druid is very strong.
---
I recall seeing a video of a hunter in Vanilla who had one. He just banked all his DKP for that and bought it. Pissed his whole guild off, but he won the DKP auction fair and square hahaha
---
If we like it, we’ll keep it alive. For a long time.  
---
Fans love what they love. 
---
A family member was die-hard into Everquest from its beta.  He STILL plays that thing.  
---
People will sub and unsub over the years, but we fans will probably always want to venture into Azeroth from time to time.  
---
5% damage to beasts and better / active regen does help quite a bit in the level grinds.
---
Berserking helps a ton for proccing weapon skills or swordspec.
---
I read somewhere that the RS3 model had a voting system for implementing new stuff into classic. I don't know how I feel about retail players have a vote. 
---
Melee does not suck after aq. Gear dependent classes also benefit a lot from gear. Warriors get insane in naxx gear. Rogues ravage clothies with naxx weapons. Warlocks are still mushrooms though. 
---
Yeah I'm pretty skeptical here as well. They're using the modern engine, and that engine is designed to work with smaller sharded zones. How hard is it to change this? That's the burning question.
---
reforged the sword
---
enlisted ghosts to take out the corsairs of umbar 
---
i guess he didnt have a smaug head to turn in
---
On private servers the 2 piece sells from about 60-150 gold for gloves and 110-250+ for legs. Pricey early on until market is saturated. 
---
Be in a guild intelligently building toward end game that has dedicated  crafters or even have a skinner to help contribute and you'll likely get a set at a discount.
---
I think  heard something recently about Archbishop Benedictus being hard to take down ? (he's also a ?? boss)
---
I would say the opposite. I think the casual players (who will make up the majority of the playerbase) were pumped and hanging out around here for the first week or 2 after the announcement. Then they forgot about it and are just waiting for more new. Right now this subreddit is more of a concentrated mass of neckbeards and tryhards. 
---
He got his sword back in the first book. The film just wanted to make Elrond look like a self-absorbed asshole, and withheld it for two movies.
---
I liked this response a lot, it shows that they realize who the fans are and how a lot of us have issues with some of the current info on the game.
---
And this is coming from me who is extremely critical of how classic wow development has been
---
this is why most DKP systems are garbage.  
---
someone just loads up on DKP to take items that they shouldnt have.
---
sounds great but there's no way i believe it until i see it
---
Only the very rare of servers perhaps. Classic will have real choices between servers and a lower population cap than the big private servers. I see this being heavily mitaged.
---
They could probably log in to retail and take a picture of the dirt in the barrens with the UI hidden and it would be the top post
---
Shhh don't suggest following the OSRS model around here or you will anger the neckbeards
---
Damn, really?
---
Next you're gonna tell me that the plural of anecdote = data, yeah?
---
a 5 second immunity to fear every 3 min isnt a big deal, if someone is using that as a crutch, they are a terrible player.
---
Not across all server no. The hardcore crowd will have pre-made guilds which means they will head in lumps toward certain servers only. 
---
Just stay off those servers. Progression in Classic WON'T be geared for the hardcore private server crowd. The bulk of the population across the spectrum of servers will be those with relatively low to no experience with original vanilla. 
---
I don't expect a historically long progressions ... but the road to Naxx in one year? LAWL! A hells no. That would be comical.
---
Or you can grab the trinket from the fishing boss in ZG and have on-demand 10% hit every 75 seconds, which is about the frequency you’ll be doing tank swaps. 
---
Farming for cunsumables!
---
It was soft capped at 500. There's still evidence of that floating on the internet, particularly about guilds like Penny Arcade, which had multiple guilds to support the number of players they had.  You could have more people in the guild, but only 500 would display in the roster. 
---
i am very well versed in tolkien.  i never stated when they made the sword, just that was a wbuff. 
---
the stop in lothlorien gave the raid buffs and only one of them lost their wbuffs before the raid ended. 
---
fun fact: gandalf was soul stoned
---
probably because he knows they don't have the ultimate say
---
How rough is NE starting zone / following leveling zones?
---
I plan to roll druid so i was curious if its efficient to just stay on kalimdor or run to meetup with friends after darkshore in lochmodan or something.
---
Im not too well versed in vanilla ally leveling compared to horde.
---
&gt; we cleared all.
---
All of MC? Good luck getting past suppression room LOL. 
---
Something to ignore a character who whispers you without having to type their name. Only relevant is gold farmers are plentiful. 
---
ty
---
Then you are free to create your own 5mans. Just be clear to people that you have no idea what you're doing and no desire to learn.
---
If this post doesn't end up at the top, everyone reading here should make a mental note about how unreliable reddit's system is at actually providing answers.  
---
Paladins aren't merely gank resistant, they are absolutely immune to ganks every time bubble hearth is available.  There are two ways to kill a fully skittish paladin in vanilla.  Both involves teams of rogues.  
---
1)- Wait until the paladin is casting a holy spell, and open out of stealth with kick.  Have enough stealthed rogues and druids required to put lethal damage into the paladin in the 3-4 effective seconds you'll have once everyone realizes the kick has happened.  The holy school being on lockout is the only force in the game that can prevent bubble.  
---
2)-  Team A hunts the paladin in the wild with enough force to compel a bubble hearth.  Team B waits at the hearth point with enough stealthed rogues and druids to finish the gank once the paladin arrives.  
---
These two situations basically require a team wanting to screw over a paladin that is famous for not dying ever- and only a paladin can achieve such notoriety in the first place, because the paladin is gank immune for all intents and purposes.
---
Hunter can bubble hearth?
---
&gt; patchwerk
---
You aren’t maintanking Patchwerk unless you want to wipe a lot. You’d have to take off a ton of pieces to be at a lower health than warriors. 
---
Druids are the best Hateful Strike soakers, leave it at that. 
---
Never played retail. Nor do I want to, chief. 
---
Sensible words.
---
I mean you clearly hacked it, classic wow hasn't even come out yet.
---
Displaying NPCs with available quests on the mini-map (golden ! icon)
---
I'm not so sure they'll touch cosmetics. They know how that, above all, will piss people off. Activision-Blizzard is greedy as hell, but I don't think they're stupid enough to shoot themselves in the foot in such an obvious way.
---
When they brought down the duration of bubble for arena, it killed bubble hearth, but only briefly.  Paladins rightly bitched that they were losing a good world pvp tool that had factored into some of them rolling the class to begin with (especially back before shattering throw and mass dispel), and Blizzard added in a glyph that decreased the cast time of hearth, but only during bubble, I think by like 5 seconds or so.  I'm not sure how it works on live, but also pretty sure they still have it.  
---
But in vanilla it's fully legit.  Not only does world pvp kinda matter, but there's a meaningful and weighty cooldown on hearthstone, and there's no meaningful counter to bubble.
---
ok I’ve repopted u to the fedz so just w8 there
---
May be a lot easier to handle when working with vanilla graphics, to be fair.
---
Yes it's time to stop trusting Blizzard to make this game because you got banned from the official forums for doing something against the official forum's rules. The horror!
---
Exactly. They could have added tier sets for fury warrior, feral druid, shadow priest, enhancement shammy, etc to outland content as well as various upgrades or situational gear for the more typical specs. It doesn't always have to be linear content.
---
Something I’ve wondered about — how would people feel about actually giving Druids their resurrection spell? Blizzard eventually rectified this, and druids not having it is annoying af in Classic if you want to play as one or group with one. I’m personally on board with it, but I’d like to see what people think here.
---
Hordies said that in vanilla, but once paladins were bifactional and mass dispel was a thing, I'd see bubble-hearth get disrupted literally whenever it could be, by everyone.  
---
Conclusion:  the number of players who find forcing a bubble hearth to be as satisfying as completing a gank is negligible.  Everyone completes the gank when provided the option.
---
One geared tank and a half geared off tank. To clarity 🙂 rest was full dps pretty much
---
I know I am in the minority. On a private server, I logged on with an alt in TB. Some random dude walked up, opened a trade window and dropped over 500 gold one me. I accepted thinking it's a dude quitting and giving their crap away (it's happened before to me).
---
He logged on with another toon and realized he traded the wrong player and started freaking out, asking me to trade it back (nicely). I did. Didn't even consider keeping it if it was a valid mistake on his part.
---
I can't even get into the minds of the selfish pricks who tend to dominate these days.
---
IT'S JUST F'ING FAKE DIGITAL CRAP!
---
Hi there Servant of the Empire,
---
I’m Josh, the host of Countdown To Classic. I appreciate you checking out the show, but even more so I appreciate the feedback. Not here to convince you otherwise on me, but try a more recent episode, luckily you don’t have to put up with me later on anywhere near as much, as the show is all about community members calling in. I frequently implore people to start with the latest stuff first rather than going in on the early episodes. But if you don’t want to try it again, I understand, thanks anyway.
---
A lot of it will be letting them exploring and doing all the things you did when you first started playing.
---
They need to 'fall in love' with the game on their own.  You being around gives them more incentive to play, but ultimately you want them to be playing the game with you because they enjoy the game just as much as they enjoy you playing with them.
---
MC is in Classic at the start. I have a feeling world first Classic Rag kill will more or less be which guild can get 40 members to 60 first. 
---
Depending on class, a lot of decent gear can be acquired while leveling. I think once the 40 members are all 60, there will maybe be a few days of dungeon gearing then MC will be cleared. Figure 40 people broken into several 5 man parties then do every dungeon each day. Even 2 or 3 nights of this while likely will not get every pre raid bis. It will vastly increase the groups power as a whole. Though who knows maybe they wont need the extra gear.
---
If dungeons are being done I assume an ally dungeon order might be: Start in IF head to BRD &gt;  LBRS &gt; Hearth &gt; Go to ST If people need the leather shoulders off the troll bosses &gt; Head to Scholo &gt; Run to Strath Live &gt; Strath Dead &gt; Hearth &gt; Head to DM, do all 3 &gt; Finally Mara for anyone that needs the ring off Princess. Do that 2-3 Days in a row and a lot of loot will be gained. This will
---
Agree completely
---
It’s where you belong with the idiotic opinion you have. 
---
Just give us a pissin release date so we can book time off work!!
---
so, you agree that such extreme censorship is good, and that instead of right-click reporting, activision should go for autoban in advance?
---
Shamans? I haven't heard that before. I don't play on private servers so I don't know for sure, but what spec/why would shamans be so powerful in T3 level gear?
---
Haha yeah fair enough, I imagine people with mass dispell liked using that move when applicable. Personally I never played a character with a way to dispell BoP so I never had to opportunity to do so, but watching someone waste a 1 hour cooldown and potentially run all the way back made me laugh, and felt like more of a punishment to the player then just taking the death 
---
There is a good slew of decent weapons available for players who don't raid in the proposed 'stage 1' content release.
---
An arcanite reaper I think is going to be a real popular choice for people looking to world pvp before the battlegrounds are available, same with the nightfall for enh shamans.
---
For those warriors who do raid MC, the Spinal Reaper (the Arcanite's bigger, meaner brother) is going to pretty iconic, especially on warriors with on kill proc building tons of free rage.
---
All my characters on the forum account (you need to choose one over lvl 10 to post) vanished for me. I can't post on official forums anymore.
---
This happened twice. They vanished, came back, then vanished again. I've posted many threads but not for months now.
---
Some REAL fishy stuff happening over there.
---
&gt; They're using the modern engine, and that engine is designed to work with smaller sharded zones
---
They're still using the same engine they were using in 2004, with improvements. This is a server issue, not with the client itself and thus should be relatively easy to 'fix' which also means not having to deal with a lot of issues the original 1.12 client has with newer hardware.
---
The Activision circle jerk is fucking ridiculous.
---
Have you considered too that HotS is a horrible comparison? They cut back on newly released content. What is the thing everyone wants to avoid in Classic? New shit. "#NoChanges". It isn't even remotely comparable. HotS didn't go away, it just isn't being updated as regularly. But people DON'T WANT CLASSIC UPDATED ANYWAY.
---
So you agree that hacking is OK and instead of banning hackers, Activision should look the other way? 
---
How does you getting banned from the official forums have any relevance to the in-game reporting system?
---
Get the fuck over yourself man. You're not that important, and no one cares that you got banned from the forums.
---
I don't think relying on a long cooldown and be miles away from your questing hub is advantageous in World PvP. Even with this concept, I think Druid is still the king of being gank-resistant as it doesn't rely on cooldowns to get away and continue playing. 
---
I expect small things to change but nothing that will deeply impact the game.
---
Hover over a trade NPC and it just displays a bag in vanilla whereas in retail it displays a repair icon if the NPC can repair.
---
Shift+Click an item to automatically search the item in the AH. 
---
Perhaps linking profession tab in chat. 
---
Now I tried to relog, and I'm getting a 500 internal server error whenever I try to access anything on the forums.
---
Pity that I'm not getting it in incognito window...
---
Yeah the GM would give you the items back if someone scammed you in this way, dunno the consequences for the scammer though.
---
The problem is that a bubble-hearth still massively inconveniences you, sometimes worse than just dying depending on where you are and where you hearthed.
---
Druid is far better if you actually want to get back to what you were doing in a timely manner.
---
hacking in terms of extracting sound effects from old installer?
---
Well, your existence is not OK then, because you're breathing and exhaling CO2.
---
But the ability to just run away from the conflict comes with flying mounts.
---
Lots of words but nothing being said really. =(
---
Removed per rule 1. This post isn't about classic but about a negative experience concerning Blizzard forums. 
---
okej, 1000 guys squelched by reporting system won't change anything either. The server has other raiders and PVPers.
---
Well, most Shamans these days play Eleresto spec in PvP. It’s a hybrid build that goes all the way down to Nature’s Swiftness in Resto and puts the remaining talents into Elemental. It’s not really viable until you have at least BWL gear but the spec becomes stronger throughout the content, scaling really well with gear.
---
Eleresto Shamans have insane burst potential while also being able to play a support/healer role pretty strongly. I don’t *think* this spec was common in retail Vanilla but it’s incredibly strong.
---
Eleresto Shamans in Naxx gear can plop down a Grounding Totem and then easily unload 5k+ damage in 2-3 seconds.
---
... finding a raid group that's willing to invest the same amount of time as I do. No more - no less.
---
Exactly. This is beginning to piss me off that I can't plan my summer time off work...
---
Ground mount is just as good to run away. And no one chases you if they're fighting for a farm spot either way.
---
Graphics usually have little to no effect on server connection
---
Well, with 16 debuff slots there might be room in your guild for a single shadow priest for raids. As far as I know they do a good debuff that boosts warlock damage by a lot! 
---
In saying that, you might want to keep a healing set for 5 mans if you plan on rolling shadow - simply because you’ll see lf1m healer more often than lf1m dps!
---
Don’t worry about people getting mad, from what I experienced of retail (wod was latest I played), is that community is non existent and that people silently face roll dungeons without really interacting. Classic will have a lot of communicating, strat discussion etc so if you cause a wipe, someone will tell you why and how to avoid. But usually that’ll come from a place of advice, not anger.
---
LOL no you didn't
---
I'm leveling my first vanilla pala right now and I'm lvl37 and still can't DS+HS
---
Plus you can macro your pvp trinket into bear and bear stun before the GCD kicks in. The enemy is attacking a beast of a Dire Bear now that just stunned them back before their 2nd attack even hits the druid.
---
"small quality-of-life improvements"
---
...
---
"like dual spec"
---
LOLOL, I just about fell outa my chair reading the title of this post.
---
&gt; What minor changes are you expecting them to make?  
---
Not OP, but it's important to remember that they are starting with retail and trying to reimplement things from classic.  Two rogue differences were apparent on the demo- if you stealthed, hunter pets would not deaggro (their aggro through stealth was always a bug, but it wasn't fixed in vanilla), *and*, if you killed a mob and had combo points on it, the combo points would not stay on the corpse, they would immediately become unusable (on live you could regen your energy to full, slice and dice, and engage the next target with a fresh S+D).  The devs had these brought to their attention.  Assume that they fix both, what else will they miss?  
---
There's different behaviors for stuns, players can't get stunned midair, and a variety of other behaviors that were later classified as bugs and fixed post-vanilla, or simply behave differently with different underlying code.  The spell batching is another huge one- maybe the devs will emulate the old spell batching, maybe they will not.  Even if they do, it will probably end up subtly different.  
---
Overall, if the playerbase and the devs can't identify the deltas in time, they'll go live and stay live for quite awhile.  It will end up being a community project to document these and hand them up to the devs, who will probably not be able to hammer them all down immediately.
---
Feel free to join our discord and guild website above and see if it's a good fit.
---
It wasn't too bad, you just need to find your niche or out of the way farm spot.    Example, my friend was a broke priest, I grabbed him and farmed eye of shadow as a duo a couple times a week.  He could keep my pet alive easily and we mowed through elites. We ended up crashing the market for them, but not before we were rich af.
---
people glossing over this but its a huge detail. one of the main reasons why Old School Runescape is so successful is because it's also considered a passion project by the developers. love to hear that.
---
More important than the class is your mount if you cannot use stealth(druid or rogue).
---
If you get away initially but you're riding a 60% mount and be chased by a 100% mount, we know how it ends.
---
Not sure who told you warrior becomes unkillable in naxx gear but mages can fireball for 4.5k, Warlocks can drain tank Warriors like puppies and, Shadow priests can do the same. As far as rogues auto's being OP this is true. That being said Rogues have so little stamina they die when people sneeze one them.
---
Rogues are a very good pvp class. Especially for world pvp. Where you can create a 1v1 situation and have all your tricks up. In a BG with multiple people around though you just get exploded a lot. I am not knocking Rogues just saying you aren't going to be dominating any bg's with one. 
---
I agree. Naxx won't satisfy hardcore raiders in 2019, period. It'll be simple in comparison to modern Mythic raids, and there's no prestige in clearing it 13 years after it was cleared for the first time. And since there's no content coming out later, they'll get bored and quit no matter what you do. 
---
Retail WoW is all about rushing to the finish. Vanilla WoW was not designed with that in mind, and releasing Naxx early will completely fuck with the pacing. If they want Classic to be a short-lived snapshot of Vanilla endgame before everyone quits, sure, release Naxx ASAP. If they want it to last for multiple years, follow the basic content release schedule that Vanilla had. 
---
Can you be more passive aggressive? You're being childish right now assuming people who don't want to read a guide to teach them how to play a game, wouldn't want to learn the content. 
---
Some people like to figure things out on their own, wow what a concept. 
---
I could probably log into retail and take a picture if the dirt in the barrens with the UI hidden and it would be the top post.  
---
Assuming i didn’t post this here.
---
If your guild is going into MC with less than 40 people, then you'll probably have an easy time getting in as an enhancement shaman. It's not ideal composition-wise but a DPS shaman is better than an empty space. And, going forward, once your guild does have a good 40-man team, you'll have a good case for sticking along as someone who's dedicated to the guild.
---
Speaking from a premade pvp perspective felhunter is almost always used, very rarely you might see SL holding a flag in AB, but most everybody runs SM/Ruin.
---
I'm not saying its a dealbreaker even for SL, its just something to be aware of. Another warlock can throw up a handful of dots on your felhunter, or a warrior/rogue can just use sweeping strikes/blade flurry and its fucking exceptionally annoying considering it completely negates the entire point of the SL spec when your pet dies.
---
Not that I need to justify this to a rager like you but it's (was?) a 12x server so getting 10 lvl 60s didn't take long.
---
I suggest you review your attitude on this subreddit, nobody likes a Negative Nancy.
---
Yes its technically the same engine, but massive parts of it were rewritten to support smaller sharded zones and megaservers. 
---
It's really just a private server issue, thank god.
---
If you honestly think a ground mount is just as good to run away I don't know what to say.
---
0 place in a guild that's concerned with min-maxing, especially as content gets harder after BWL.
---
But in a meme guild its welcome and fun.
---
Honestly though nobody uses succy in serious bgs, charm is good and all, but because of DR's and how squishy she is your usually better off with felhunter, or VW
---
Knowing whats going on is expected of you if you play with other people.
---
To take a real-life example, when I was in the band I expected the people I played with to learn the material before practice instead of waiting for practice day and learn it during the few hours we have in the rehersal room.
---
Against.
---
Druids can bres, but they can't do a regular res.
---
This falls under the category of "Class uniqueness and variety" why change it? Why dilute it?
---
In 5 mans, why not take a shadow priest or a ret to fill the non combat res hole in the group? They can also help offhealing as druids are not the best 5 man healers. (I don't know what the attitude of people will be when classic actually launches, but with the class limitations hybrids can get a lot more value out of their utility in dungeons where the number in the group is restricted compared to raids where everyone is best off doing just one task, so they are relatively better in dungeons than raids anyway)
---
In raids, it doesn't matter.
---
In world content, it doesnt matter, druid is just another one of the majority of classes which cant res.
---
This makes 0 sense. The smaller section of people was more representative of the player base than the larger one?
---
Vanilla enchants require a pretty varied set of mats. You can maybe expect the enchanter to sell you some high level de mats, but the 50 or so other mats used in common enchants - not so much
---
A player buys a token with real money. The player then trades the token for classic gold.
---
This means that there is a market for people farming gold for real money.
---
This leads to market inflation because there is more gold in the game then there should be.
---
This means people who are not buying gold are at a disadvantage.
---
The missing instant damage isn't the problem with the pala.
---
The RetPala could make a viable raid char if you just do some minor dmg increasements.
---
The major flaw is not having any range attack or any taunt.
---
Thanks for an awsome reply. The thing im thinking about is that a paladin following me just makes me kinda powerfull in of itself. I dont mind raiding here and there but what are the odds of actually getting ashkandi or BRE for that matter. SO much competition for those weapons.
---
That whole aq40 and naxx argument is true for all classes, thats just how vanilla is. On my mage i always felt that my hp was a problem. Im thinking for short term. When bwl is out and some players have gear from there is that blue gear + TUF with a paladin enjoyable?
---
I dont care about getting spanked here and there by WAY overgeared people because thats the case with most classes. My main concern is that TUF is not in the least acceptable damage for equally geared classes. How much is a crit with that gear? A mage in similar gear crits for about 1.5k.
---
Okay well are we talking about in a duel or BG ? Because yea obviously in a duel t3 vs t3 warrior will struggle a bit, if we have to both wear t3. But if we are talking most optimal gear duels, the warrior could be wearing optimal shadow resist gear vs the warlock or frost vs mage. Now we have an interesting duel!
---
If we are talking BG, good luck killing a warrior with a healer!
---
That is reversed. The min-max guild is the meme guild. Being inclusive of all play styles and not being dicks about it is not a meme. It's how "normal" people play.
---
But I get your point. Enh as a progression raid slot "can" happen but I believe it's post 16 debuff slot or at the very least (or often the primary reason) is using Nightfall. I've seen some trihards on private servers run full dps Enhancement using the best axe available and full magic dumping and still beat all hunters but it would likely be a guild who has already mastered all boss fights many times across servers previously.
---
Enhancement shaman is good for solo play (grinding/farming/etc.) and for small groups (5 mans, and small group pvp).
---
Enhance solo in pvp is actually quite weak, heavily reliant on RNG for WF, lack of real mobility, easily kited at long range, and lack of mana for sustain and healing.
---
However, some of your core abilities act as force mulitlpiers as a shaman, such as grounding totem, ranged snares and interupts, aoe slows, fear/charm/sleep break for teammates via tremor totem, WF totem for warriors, etc.
---
And if you play with an elemental shaman, your storm strike damage multiplier will increase the damage of the ele shamans much stronger earth shocks or crit lightning spells, easily enabling the ele shaman to global whatever you're attacking.  That and two grounding totems is a nightmare to deal with.
---
So the take away is an enhancement shaman is rather lackluster on their own, but in small groups act as a force multiplier that can be quite powerful with their spellkit.
---
That and loot drama. Clear loot rules, and consistent following of them is important. Someone catching others out at scamming the system always goes south in a heartbeat, and the loot drama's terrible for the guild. 
---
Being realistic, I think that's accurate. I intend to play Classic at my own pace and take it all in, but that won't take me 5 years. A couple years of entertainment is all I'm expecting, after all I've played it before and I eventually (after thousands of hours) got bored the first time around. There's no fucking way I'm doing as many MC runs as I did in 2005-2006. 
---
However, I think they can just keep it running as it is, people will relog in here and there, there'll always be a smaller PvP population, etc. Servers are infinitely more flexible now and there'll be no pressing financial reasons to shut them down individually. 
---
I kind of would like it too, but it to some extent encourages non objective focused behavior. As an extreme example from a different MMO with a similar BG system, in Rift I played as a Harbinger/Chloromancer build which was a very tanky single target DPS and healing hybrid. 
---
Usually if I met a mirror of my build 1v1 we would just go our separate ways because we couldn't kill each other. But once for the lulz we just wailed on each other all game, topping both the damage and healing charts but accomplishing nothing other than tying each other up. We probably wouldn't have done that if damage/healing wasn't displayed.
---
I think the blanket statement of "massive parts" is really not something either of us can speak to with any degree of accuracy, it's an uneducated assumption at best. That said, Megaservers and sharding were both integrated far in advance of the performance declines we've seen in BfA and the lag occurs server-side, not just within the client.
---
Jesus lol ...what a comparison. In no way does your example compare here. Are we performing in 5 man dungeons or adventuring? I thought this was a MMO, not my job. Will I get fired from wow if I don't read a guide how to kill the druids of the fang beforehand? Or are you blowing this out of proportion? 
---
The hungry revere table scraps as if it were a feast.
---
Nice intro ricardoFlick
---
No, you should definitely do it since you posted this here because M E T A
---
My main in vanilla was a frost mage and I always loved how I was able to escape and survive if I wanted.
---
Blink, 2xFrost Barrier, 2x Frost Block, Sheep, Counterspell, Escape Artist as Gnome
---
Interesting. I know Shamans can be great in PvP overall, I just didn't think Ele damage actually scaled that well. 
---
They won't have GMs like they did before, they already talked about this, 99.9% of issues are resolved through an automated system, including loot restoration
---
I believe there is a post somewhere saying that they got thousands among thousands of reports of ninjaing back in the day and in order to combat this they're just "letting the community handle it"
---
This is also why they added loot trading (24 hour window to trade loot you get with other people in the party) because of how many tickets they got about loot issues
---
Also Blizzard has NEVER accepted screenshots as any kind of proof, too easy to photoshop.
---
They’re not the scaling monsters Warlocks are but they do get stronger in the later content
---
Those are all good guesses, I agree -- I kind of hope they dont do it though because all of those things encourage people to talk to other in their community. Ask about which npcs can repair, read their actual titles and names, talk about their professions with cute custom shout macros that you can identify instead of spamming links, etc etc
---
I think you might be right though. 
---
HotS was a shit game with no players. Vanilla WoW was an amazing game with millions of players.
---
Very different situations. 
---
I'm really not worried about sharding at all. Blizz has never wavered from the "starting zone only" thing, and as long as they stick to that its fine. I've never played on private servers, been a WoW veteran dating back to launch. As far as loot trading, we had a similar problem with need before greed rolls. Yeah its not exactly the same as you couldn't trade BoPs, but there were still assholes that rolled need on stuff they couldn't use (lol hunter loot) just so they could vendor it or DE. I don't think loot trading will be a problem as long as Blizzard keeps to the promise to only shard the starting zones. How do you think the community is going to react the first time someone posts screenshots of their characters being extorted for loot, or someone gets caught scamming UBRS runs to funnel gear? The social pressure will be there to force people not to be a dick in game. And hey, it's just more incentive to find good friends and a good guild so you don't have to worry about PUGs. Without sharding or the LFD/R server hop I just don't think scams will be viable. Yeah there will be some scammers and ninja looters out there, but we've always had those people in the game. Be active on your realm server and you'll find out who they are so you can avoid them. Fool me once, get added to my ignore list.
---
Yeah but on every Classic server there will be a vocal minority of private server players who will command absurd perfection.
---
I once joined a raid guild on a pserver a few years ago, like 2014. And they demanded everyone flask up for MC. It was a giant joke. That's not indicative of private servers, really, but only in this environment of min/maxing would a dumb person ever conclude that it is necessary or a good idea to force guildies to shell out 200 gold for a single fucking MC run.
---
Blue gear as in non rank 10 gear/BG reputation gear is pretty bad as Warrior you’ll get rekted by everything.
---
BG Rep gear, rank 10 gear and unstoppable force is completely find and will put you toe to toe with BWL gear. The holy paly PvP set isn’t that bad for PvP healing tbh but he should try to raid a bit to get some
---
Nice pieces and a 1her/shield.
---
Btw I will be doing the same strategy with my brother and we will not likely raid for the best pieces.
---
So I’m banking on being on the same position as you and I’m ok with it. It’s honestly a blast overall 
---
There are only really 2 places to farm ele earth, and the other one is a lvl 20 quest area so not much better.
---
A single raider can easily go through a stack of ele earth on a good aq40. On a bad one you could be looking at 3-4 stacks. For every single raider.
---
The real solution (and what happened back in vanilla) is to not have 10k+ people packed onto one server.
---
I think it's fine. If we're gonna make changes that the purists will writhe in agony from, at least it should be something worth the trouble like guild banks.
---
Idk why but wanting so much more boring to me than auto attacking or autoshotting. I can never seem to level a caster past the teens because of this
---
On most recent private server, only a handful of guilds cleared aq40 on week 1. Like 10-20. That is 400-800 people on a 10k+ pop server. That is not the "casual" guilds. You are full of shit.
---
Perhaps. Though an extra re-skinned version of the Night Elf Tiger mount, for instance, that isn't adding new models into the game wouldn't be that big a deal. I mean at the end of the day, if the game is 95% close to the original game, people will be fine and lots of stuff people worry about nowadays will be of pretty marginal importance.
---
&gt; A player buys a token with real money.  
---
He can't.  He can list the token on the retail AH, and get retail gold for it.  He can't list the token on the classic AH.  He cannot trade it for classic gold.

haha perfect. Maybe i'll even give out rewards for tracking me down and killing me. I'm super excited for some world pvp.

You tell me which of these pieces is "itemized perfectly".

---
Resto shamans go enchance talents for this specific reason.
---
Also to this point
---
&gt;Being inclusive of all play styles
---
It's less about being a dick and more about some content being tough for people new to the game. You won't kill C'thun if you have a bunch of enchancement shamans unless you have a really solid 40 man roster.
---
I get what you mean though because most people probably wont give a rats ass about the giant eye, but hardcore raiders will, and that's what I'm trying to express.
---
Haha oh man... what a story!
---
Druid are better at avoiding gank, they got the minimap tracking + stealth.
---
I should be more clear. I think Shadow Priests are the best in group pvp. Once you get Nax gear + TOEP + Herioc Charm. You can tab dot annihilate an enemy team. while healing your party for 25% of DOT damage and still being able to spam shields and dispel magic.
---
All of that being said. I can respect that some people think Mage and Warlock are better. 
---
Does the team have the authority to decide or is someone upper management able to make the money decisions without them?
---
Druid is pretty good dps with front-stabbing, but still definitely less than hunter, their main strength is travel speed boosts at lvl 20 and 30 and low downtime.   
---
Without front stabbing, Druid takes a massive dps cut, claw is a terrible skill compared to shred - it’s something like a 20% damage loss. They’re still good levellers, but they aren’t any where near close to hunters like they are on PSers.
---
Besides loot sharing &amp; sharding hopefully doesnt get implemented.
---
Ythisens, thank you for being our man inside.
---
More pls
---
I'm sorry I should have been more clear. It is my opinion that after Naxx. Most server PVP is dominated by Mages and, Warlocks in Naxx gear. I do not think warriors are very playable after Naxx gear gets introduced. They simply die far too quickly to casters launching 4k+ damage spells. 
---
I personally think that most melee classes are pretty poor after Naxx. They don't get enough stamina and won't survive the spells. I also think any argument of but "if I have a priest" is pretty negated by the fact that mages are popular enough to keep your priest Sheeped. If you ever become a problem.
---
Everything is a passion project to the devs until the higher ups ask where the money is at. To be real, this comment gave us nothing but any comment is welcome when we are getting jack shit about the direction of this project. 
---
If loot trading is a thing I’m sticking with private servers. Loot trading will literally kill the community.
---
Well yes obviously for patchwerk i meant it make the encounter easier if they soak the hateful strike.
---
LMFAO yeah blah blah blah summed it up perfectly 
---
It’s called trust. If you steal the mats and log out your reputation on the server is gone. Remember that there is no name change in Vanilla. 
---
I don't think druids have tracking
---
That's a really tough one man - I think the main issue for people is the investment of it. Nowadays everything is instant gratification and vanilla is slow af so it's understandable that people can't commit to it.
---
I'd say keep the focus on trying to have a good time with them, rather than getting them invested in the game. Tell jokes, talk about IRL stuff, and get them engaged with how mundane the valley of trials or northshire abbey is just to get them past that point, then if you can get past the start zones make it clear how vast and complex the world (of warcraft) actually is by telling them what they can do - don't just try to follow the quest chains. Start your professions with them, try to raid hard mob groups for no reason, do a bit of RP?, go to a different zone. Just don't make them feel like they're just playing for you and don't lecture them on their play style - let them explore and if you feel they need a guiding hand then do it with good humour. BUT try to avoid anything that will involve way too much walking - like trying to find some pvp at lvl 6...
---
I would strongly advise starting with them a month or 2 after release so that you can 'accidentally' run into some geared lvl 60s in a city and give them a sense of awe and something to aspire to, and the zones wont be too congested.
---
Good luck! ;)
---
If it's very successful I would like to see new content from locked zones added. Staying level 60, but opening more content and lore to the world. Exploring the mystery without another 10 levels or gear treadmill. Karazhan, Grim Batol, a whole lot of places. Gilneas too.
---
Front stabbing only excist on Pservers. It wasnt in vanilla. 
---
Fun to hear you are going for the same strategy. What my question really is when i think about it is the following. Is warrior paladin combo OP enough to play more casual? Mage might be strong for solo with very little gear but from a combo perspective is warrior paladin not one of the strongest even without top gear?
---
I think you can at level 44 or 50
---
If you've concluded that loot trading would kill the Classic WoW experience, why haven't you concluded that, say, private server admins selling P2W gear would also kill that same experience?
---
A masterpiece, an absolute work of art. Smashing, really.
---
Yeah I agree. Have you tried grouping with loot trading? Using trade chat? The auction house? Creating a guild? Killing and looting mobs? Pressing W to move Forwards? These are all things that will be impossible with loot trading. It's insane how they think the game will function even in its most basic form if loot trading is a thing. I was looking Forward to the classic experience with level 60 Talents and old raids with a nice guild but now I hear that random people will be able to abuse a situational mechanic in PUG Dungeons in early dungeon running ONCE before they're flagged as ninja looters so obviously the entire game is ruined.
---
I'm with you. If they implement loot trading I'll go with you and play with everyone else that wants the real WoW on a guesstimated private server. All eight of us. 
---
Yes it was in dire mail. It actually came in the mailbox when you were done. 
---
Epic warlock mount quest was in DM but base mount was just taught by the spell trainer
---
Resto Druid rogue or priest mage or warlock paly/Druid are probably better combos overall to duo PvP with if you have like basic PvP gear.
---
However idk. There’s something really fun raiding a town as a warrior and a holy paly dropping heals on you.
---
You can probably take out 3-4 players if you get really good. Timing fears, HoJ, sacrifices, bubbles, freedoms, it’s a very solid combo that rewards skills.
---
If casual as in you will put in the time to attain exalted and rank 10 gear, yea it’s good enough. If you don’t think you can land those things in reasonable amounts of times I would elect caster classes with mobile healers like priest or Resto Druid.
---
DKP at its extreme worst. Also would have /gquit right there.
---
An add on like pally power for 5 minute blessings where you can assign buffs based on the player rather than the class.
---
For example, dps warrior gets might while tanking warrior gets kings.
---
I know, that was really my point, I should have been more specific.
---
No it won't, but if you think that is so important so then you're free to stay on pservers.
---
I'll give an example. I raided MC this weekend with my guild on a pserver. A pair of really nice bracers drop from a majordomo, which I want (because I'm in pleb blues). However, our RL missclicks when he's supposed to link the bracers and loots them instead. Guild is mad, but nothing can be done. With loot trading this would be a non-issue.
---
Now I know the point a lot of people are making when it comes to dungeon loot. However, there are a lot of other things toxic players already do. Disconnecting after a certain boss is a thing (like half of our casters getting a "DC" after Jed in UBRS), and generally people do shitty things sometimes. 
---
If you want a guaranteed smooth dungeon, go with guildies. Or just pug it and hope for the best, pservers are known for being toxic and classic will, with some luck, bring in more sympathetic players who doesn't think the height of comedy is spamming the n word in world chat.
---
Thank you! Makes alot of sense. I will talk to my brother on how much time we will spend. I will probably spend quite alot of time but I just dont like the RNG aspect and scheduled time of raiding. It's fun but I hate feeling THAT commited to a game where I need to be on time. Im gonna raid sometimes for fun but that wont get you any gear.
---
Whats so great about mage/priest? My brother wanna play either pally or priest. Mage might be an option again but ya, please explain.
---
I fully expect Rag to die during 2nd lockout after launch (maybe 3rd if 1st lockout resets shortly after launch day).
---
D2 is not "bumping."
---
An addon I have always wanted was one that automatically announced in /3 that you have been killed by an enemy player, the coordinates and area name of where you died, that players name,class,race,level. 
---
Fix, fix? No changes reeeeeeee /s
---
Priest/warr combo is ok but I wouldn’t do it. Priest cannot protect themselves very well just FYI, holy paly is miles better for a warr.
---
And priest/mage is a lot of fun because disc priest can drop their 31 talent on themselves or on the mage and blow shit up. Mage can cc shit and protect the priest. Priest has manaburn and it’s pretty fun applying pressure on people when they’re focusing the mage and the mage just kites. 
---
The best part is probably the priest can go shadow and mage/shadow priest still works together very well. So the flexibility of specs adds another layer of fun. 
---
And rank 10 gear for both classes are very very solid, with you competing against Naxx gear a bit better then a warr/paly would.
---
However the players have to be GOOD. Being a good mage is HARD. 
---
Stop it, I'm already hard.
---
They don't scale well in raids compared to other casters. But that's mainly because they are terribly mana starved and don't have any debuffs that boost nature damage. For example fire mage and warlock get +10% damage from curses and +15% damage from improved scorch/shadow weaving. Nature doesn't get any boost because Stormstrike isn't allowed in raids (and even if it was it only lasts 2 charges on a 20s cooldown).
---
I liked the tiny addon called TooltipItemIcon that displayed the icon next to the tooltip when clicking on an item link in chat. Probably one of the least useful addons, but it felt more complete and worked as fun trivia.
---
No problem man! 
---
More like TitsOut.
---
no. forst mages dont stand a chance vs shamans. if anything elemental spec mages with blastwave have a chance aoe bursting them in tight spaces, but even that is a stretch.
---
Without raid/dungeon gear it's going to feel so underwhelming especially when your enemies are constantly outgearing you. And warrior requires waaaaaaay more dedication than every other class, imo it can't be played casually if you want to enjoy the class which is exactly why im NOT rolling warrior this time round :'(
---
Perhaps consider a SP, Druid, Rogue or Hunter? In my experience the least gear dependent classes are the most fun, at least for the first tier and a half...
---
Just stay in your parent’s basement farming ele earth all day plz. 
---
No it wasn't. What are you talking about?
---
Paladins dominate healing at this point, you pretty much can not oom in PvP. Warlocks on sheer damage
---
People only upvote low effort memes and shitposts.
---
The screenshot is for me to call the person out on the server forum, gms can see the trade and chat logs.
---
They do.
---
In cat form druids can track humanoids. I'm playing a druid on Pservers right now. 
---
&gt; chinese farmers to sell monthly subscriptions at a lower price then the amount you would pay for
---
Tokens can't be traded between players, you can only buy and sell them through the AH.
---
So only thing goldsellers can sell you is actually gold, nothing different from what's happening already in the last 15 years, they will exist in Classic too but it will still be a bannable offense.
---
I played recently on a private server with a guild that went 8/9 AQ40 as an enhancement shaman. If you like having a lot of jobs in raids then definitely go for this class.
---
In terms of finding a spot, It depends on the guild honestly, melee classes want you so if theres high ranking melee officers definitely single them out and talk to them. 
---
Just make sure your totems are 100% uptime and dont expect to top the charts ever. The name escapes me also now but theres a BOE axe that increases targets spell damage taken by like 15% that's a sure fire way to find a guild. 
---
Druids are great at escaping.  Pallys are great at not dying and are such a hard nut to crack people often don't bother.  Rogues are great at escaping, coming back and murdering people.   Hunters have great tools to detect and stop an incoming gank (radar, traps and flair to find stealthed classes) and amazing kiting ability that lets you beat pretty much any class in world PvP when played right.
---
LPT: Dual monitors
---
Skinning + leather working followed by DE some stuff via enchanting is the fastest way to get a wand.  There's also almost no money to be made early on selling wands because no one has any money at the start.
---
Are you kidding...
---
The enchanter enchants your gloves and you show him the mats and tip, both hit accept, and that's it scam proof
---
This only works if both sides have the mats
---
I hadn't thought about that.  World buffs were not a big thing for vanilla players.  Just something nice to have from time to time for grinding/PvP.  They never dropped at the pace I see on private servers for PvE purposes.
---
I see. Thing is im so sick of mage. My and my brother had a blast with warrior paladin combo while leveling because of instant dungeons. Charging in with freedom and mortal strike, execute is damn fun when you world pvp aswell!
---
Im not looking for the absolute optimal setting. HAving fun beats winning IMO aslong as you dont lose all the time. What we found fun in Bgs is that you are up and running when you spawn. WArrior paladin just feels very sturdy aslong as the paladin have mana.
---
On the other hand mage is without of doubt my strongest class. Im not amazing but im decent and understand all the matchups. Whats boring with mage is that gear have almost no impact when you level. When you get a new weapon for a warrior you become so much stronger and that gives more incentive to run dungeons.
---
Arrrghh so hard to decide. Classic is so time consuming that you have to really think about your choices.
---
It's very exciting.
---
Druid and rogue. Pick the on you like the most. 
---
A basic group building addon that tracks LFM/LFG chat messages and adds them to a list of people looking for groups with what the message was, how long ago it was sent, and who sent it. 
---
This will help with fast moving trade chat and make it so you don't have to trawl through your chat history to see what's going on.
---
Yea I thought a lot about it too. I basically decided if my brother goes Warrior ( I actually like healing nowadays and I can just teach him how to get gud) I’m going holy paly and if he goes anything else it’s priest or Resto Druid(I really enjoy the survivability of Resto Druid and the rarity of the class) 
---
Mage druid rogue
---
Sounds good. How much time are you gonna give it this time around?
---
Seeing as it hasn’t been brought up yet, check out Total Biscuit’s old ‘Blue Plz!’ series. Usually the go to for people looking for pods from back in the day:
---
https://youtu.be/yFIW0EXGLfc
---
I started in BC and played consistently until MoP. I've never had anyone steal from me in this manner.  
---
Diablo 2 on the other hand...
---
Player only tab target 
---
Well ya, if ever I even mention Enhancement around a raid ... it's only 1! 
---
It's a true meme to be sure.
---
It's the big plus of DKP. I get to decide what gear I have, rather than everyone else deciding that.
---
Enhc only has a place in leveling, for pvp u go ele for pve its resto
---
Dat stealth animation, tho
---
Idk I’m not 15 anymore and now gonna be an attorney.  Probably not a lot. Probably enough to get rank 10 gear 
---
I probably give it way more thought then I should. I’ve been playing retrowow for like refreshment. 
---
This is how you cope with faliure
---
Yeah but after thinking about it, nowadays people know everything (ok the hardcore ones, but still a lot of people remember parts and leveling is greatly speed up for 99,9% of players compared to originally)  
---
So NOT releasing DM on release would be noice, people are gonna down ragnaros anyways like its a joke even with shittier gear... or not lul  
---
also, I love that BGs are step 2, holy fuck the World PvP will be amazing
---
they do in cat form

Quite the conundrum 
---
Lemme give em a call and see if I can visit for a few days. East coast time zone means I can be up even earlier to go farmwhatever quest mobs you need ;)
---
Haha ya well that does sound healthy :P
---
I will actually have the time because im studying. But even if I have the time im not a hardcore gamer and enjoy socialsing too much for the hardcore raiding scene.
---
Plus the talent trees are kinda weak at buffing up the main Ele spells. Lots of crit, bit of hit, and only like 5% damage. Compared to 6-15% flat for mages and locks, and random bonuses to particular spells. 
---
The major herd of people were 60 but back in vanilla people didn't rush into MC as fast as I think they will in classic.  My guild was one of the first guilds into MC and I distinctly remember our 2nd or 3rd raid the MT asked if he could equip some DM gear with the strange +def stat that no one knew how it worked.  So I think it's safe to say all but the world first type guilds went into MC with plenty of DM gear.
---
As everyone else is saying pally&gt;druid
---
But most classes have a escape. Mages can freeze-tele and mount
---
Priest and locks have fears, hunters have traps-Cheeta, rogues have so many escapes but hunters can track them regardless.  But the pally bubble Hearth, and druids being the ultimate kites make them 1&amp;2
---
I agree with 2nd. I figured out some numbers a few weeks ago putting average "no life" leveler hitting 60 in 7 to 9 days IRL. That's assuming a range of 16-18 hours played a day and hitting 60 in about 5.5 days /played.
---
Assuming I am correct, a little over 1 week after launch(likely on a Tuesday) the first guild pushing for a world first rag will dinged 60. That gives them a a week to gear and beat MC.
---
A thought occurs to me. Can rag even be summoned? Raids need that spec3water to out out the rubes in order to spawn Major Domo. Iirc that water is based on rep, can netrual repped players even get that water yet? If not a raid group won't be able to get any water to even summon Domo.... Though I guess you could farm trash for rep and leave the bosses alive so the trash respawns... Hmmm
---
Weird.  My casual raiding guild stipend both the MT and main OT's repair bills.
---
I personally always used succubus after I was geared out.  I would consistently take ab flags 3v1, and was a god of warsong gulch flag defense... but I did switch up the pet for different circumstances a lot.  I found the succubus covered all of my weaknesses really well (playing as SM/RUIN).
---
Not really on topic but, I can't emphasize enough to not try and reach high stat bloat through leathers or chainmail before superior plate is available.
---
I ran into a few dps warriors in BGs who just wore their dps leathers. I was playing full feral at the time and would see plate wearing warriors run by while I was stealthed and often decided to ignore them due to how long the fight would take.
---
If I saw a leather wearing warrior, I ganked them knowing it was the easiest fight I'd have during the entire BG game. Armor is THAT important to warriors. 
---
You mean getting carried in AQ40?
---
The sarcasm is strong with this one.
---
Horizontal expansion doesn't work well in the long run. You end up with super specialized gear in raids where 90% of it gets sharded. And people quickly lose interest in running a raid for a couple hours where nothing drops. It was done a couple times in Everquest and those ended up being really bad xpacs.
---
Hours later lul
---
lol it was just funny to think about them sitting in stormwind saying "hmm I should go do so-and-so" hop on the boat, go across the ocean, fly to your quest hub, start doing whatever then just bubble hearth all the way back home. lmao 
---
From my experience on Nostalrius, which was bigger in population than what official servers are gonna be:
---
Those kind of enchants were really really rare and the guys having them were making loads of gold (like 100s per day). I never ever feared to get scammed from one of them. This is what would happen if i got scammed: 
---
I would report to my GM, the name would get removed from our forum, then we would contact all the guilds we were in contact with to warn them, by the end of the day every single end game PVE guild on the server would know he's a scammer and he would stop making money. 
---
But that's not it, it's not just the players that have a reputation to maintain, guilds have too, so we would definitely contact the guild he was in and he would get kicked out . And now every other serious guild know he's a scammer so they are not gonna recruit him. 
---
So not only  would he lose a way to make a fuckton of gold but he wouldn't be able to raid anymore, his only option would be to reroll a new character and i can tell you, with the time it takes to get lv 60 and gear yourself enough to raid, that's not something you want to do.
---
Reputation on Vanilla is BRUTAL. 
---
Everquest is a bad example, because even when they don't increase the level cap they still give better gear, spells, and AAs(talent points essentially). The only time they really did sidegrades was LDoN and LoY expansions and those were both crap.
---
I mean honestly in my group of friends and guildies and everything we all took several months to hit 60.  Dire maul was released when I was personally in my 50s but I didn't enter it for a long time because I just simply didn't understand that I should be doing it.. It will obviously be a lot different with us all rushing to gear up with BiS shopping lists but I don't think DM being out to start is really going to kill the vibe.
---
I can see something similar to soft inting like in league happening. You'll have these guys in their own discord using both factions making it look like they're against each other but are actually working together, how they make it look like they aren't working together idk but believe groups like the devilsaur mafia will exist still on classic. Devilsaur is the money maker if you can control the entire supply.
---
Yeah that's a pretty extreme case. I'm pretty sure most guilds wouldn't have put Thunderfury on the DKP system at all, once it was clear what it was. BiS tank weapon = automatic to the MT.
---
Hey guys,  
---
Tomorrow is the Q4 earnings call for Activision Blizzard. For those unaware, the company just experienced one of its poorest financial performances in decades, which could lead to the company revealing more information about upcoming products (i.e., Classic). I talk more about the earnings call and the events of tomorrow in the video, but here is the TL;DR for those who don't have time to watch:
---
TL;DR
---
1. ATVI has been struggling financially (down 60% in 4 months)
---
2. Classic WoW is one of the few products to be released this year
---
3. To combat investor anxiety and restore consumer confience, ATVI could reveal information on Classic
---
4. Release date time frame could be narrowed (i.e., early/later summer specified. In all likelihood, no release DATE will be given)
---
5. Prospect of micro-transactions could be discussed during the call  
---
Hope to see you guys on stream tomorrow as we watch the call live &lt;3.
---
&gt; debuff limit is 16 from the get go
---
Since we getting 1.12, the debuff limit should be 16 and not 8.
---
I hate that we nitpicking every small details like this or spell batching. Neither come closer to loot trading or sharding have way more bigger impact on gameplay. By the way they promised to not shard the server later times, but if the server infrastructure couldn't handle big WPVP events, then we are fucked either way...
---
&gt; The min-max guild is the meme guild. Being inclusive of all play styles and not being dicks about it is not a meme. It's how "normal" people play.
---
Wanting to actually clear all of the content doesn't make people dicks.
---
No one is saying you won't get through MC/BWL with a couple odd specs but if you want to clear all of AQ40 and not have your guild fall apart after 3 weeks of trying and failing to kill Cthun there isn't really room for an enhancement shaman.
---
This is a passion project for us! That's why we brought in right click reporting! You can now stop anyone from playing who says something you remotely disagree with! Remove the swear filter then report everyone! Even better, that guy playing 18 hours a day for 3 months straight? Report him for something minor his last week of ranking and watch him kill himself IRL after he is autobanned and deranks! What says passion more than giving you the power to actually kill people?
---
Yeah dude above wot?
---
Back in actual retail if someone scammed you for your matts it was reportable. They didn't always restore your items but I've seen people get banned.
---
This doesn't sound so bad actually...
---
Problem is that regardless there will be an angry group of grumpy people angrily saying that classic is shit and worthless. My tip would be to avoid r/classicwow and r/wow for the beginning of classic if you just want to enjoy the game like everyone else.
---
I bet my level 40 Mount money that some dude will have an absolute meltdown because a tree is in the wrong spot.
---
Beta test will start on release day.
---
Yes it is. They didn't always restore items but they 100% banned people who scammed.
---
Shapeshifting triggers the GCD so that's not possible.
---
[https://i.redd.it/l1mxs21y0xf21.jpg](https://i.redd.it/l1mxs21y0xf21.jpg)
---
You must trust.
---
Its a super important detail. But that likely wont stop people from claiming theres gonna be WoW Tokens and a cash shop because *dun dun dun* Activision!
---
ATVI's stock price has nothing to do with how much revenue they're grossing. Also they're publishing plenty of things this year besides Classic. 
---
My favorite parts of these are when people start acting all hard with phrases like "I'll mute him all damn day I don't give a *fuck*"  
---
Cookie cutter internet tough guy build   
---
100% 
---
Once Wrath ended my interest in the story dried up. He had an amazing character arc that really made you feel for him. All he wanted to do was save as many as possible, and it was his friend's lack of foresight that damned him by putting him at odds with the greatest resources of Azeroth and therefore anyone who could have helped him stay sane. Or, you know, actually destroy the Lich King. 
---
Then when his story ended though.... that final raid against him was amazing. You have a tear jerking moment of respite with his father before the consequences of his path turn him into nothing. I felt that feeling you get when you finish a great book and you know it's the last of a series.
---
AND THEN THEY JUST REPLACE HIM WITH SOME RELATIVE NOBODY. At the 11th hour Blizz just lost the muse and tied his story up in the most hamfisted way possible. Now firelich.
---
No way, a single 16 slot would cover the majority of enchants requested by level 60s and part of a second bag would have the spillover for less common requests.
---
 I don't understand why this is a discussion. 
---
They farm hydraxian rep in silithus off elementals to get the waters
---
Yea something about not able to run at all makes it so much more boring.
---
You mean like every bottom 10 performer of any raid?
---
Ah ok that sounds about right.  Part of the fun farming there was there being a good chance of some world pvp too, for me anyway. 
---
You can only vote for new content in-game in OSRS. The sub is shared, so RS3 folks can make an OSRS character and vote, but mostly we stay out of each other's polls.
---
This is the answer.  You put all the mats in the main window, the item in the will not be traded window, and the fee in the gold thing.  When the enchanter presses to apply the enchant, you will see it appear, and then he will hit trade.  You check to make sure the enchant is going to be applied, then you hit trade.  
---
This requires the enchanter to have all the mats to begin with, so you'll probably need to tip a bit more than normal.  
---
In practice, people always just handed me the mats, and pressed trade.  Then I would ask for the fee if they didn't put that in, and they'd provide that, then I'd press trade.  Then I'd enchant the item.  I was not willing to take the mats without the fee, because there were assholes that would claim you stole their mats (while refusing to take them back), and you'd have to be in a pile of GM tickets, all to get out of the enchanter's fee.  
---
With this method I basically had no problems ever.  Obviously they had to trust me, but no enchanter will risk ripping someone off- hell, even on retail, it's basically unheard of.
---
how was this 5 days ago yet we're just hearing about it here?
---
Do it. You wont.
---
You never really want to farm the mats (or devilsaurs in this case) yourself. What is much more efficient is doing the best gold farm you can and then buying the mats from AH. 
---
I would really like this, while disallowing add-ons to give quests tracking. It's convenient, but it makes people less dependent on others. at the end of the day, I'm sure it'll be implemented though
---
Questie is a mod that does this?
---
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
You do need an account of a certain level to vote, albeit nothing hard, but it does help

Surprised not to see Warlock. You aren't super great at surviving until 40 , but 40-60 is going to be over 50% of leveling playtime for most people, and at 40+, you can easily survive ganks, 2v1s and others if you're SL and keep a voidwalker up at all times. Healthstones, fears can let you run and mount, and deathcoil is amazing when you get jumped.
---
paladin is probably at the top (the infamous bubbleheart), but I wouldn't underrate priests either. if you know what you're doing, you'll probably be constantly near max health and mana, so you're not all that easy to catch with your pants down, and if anybody attacks you... oh boy.
---
between fears, dots, mind control and hard hitting ranged spells... well, let's just say priest aren't the easiest targets to take down. a ganking attempt can just as easily result in the offender running into a pack of mobs while feared/MCd as the priests death, and dots can turn a victory into a rather pyrrhic one, as the attacked bites the dust... and when he resurrects, he will have a rather pissed off priest waiting for him.
---
while stealth is rather useful for druids and rogues, they are much easier caught with low hp, and even if fear of reverse ganking is there, if I see a rogue with low health, he'll be soon corpserunning, that's sure as shit.

Stream delay kills the stream. The popular streamers rely on chat interaction.

You can never know around here, I've seen people unironically suggest ferals main tank Patchwerk, glad we cleared that up though.
---
&gt;You don’t bring a trial into a progression raid unless you already know their general abilities.
---
Yeah I remember that being a Vanilla policy for us as well. It's kind of interestingly opposite on retail now, we generally don't pass trials until they prove themselves on progress. 
---
Ironically, the community is what's making me hate Classic.
---
Hell, look at some of the most upvoted things in this thread going on about "BFA babies" who can't handle challenge, shaming mount farming as if it didn't exist in classic (It did), "Those people can go back to a wholly inferior product" etc.
---
I was worried Classic would attract this self important, smug, arrogant attitude...and here it is.
---
I agree, but they're going to be getting money...me and 10 of my old guildmates are coming back just for Classic.  That's $150/ month just off our subs. If I know 10 people personally who are coming back, there's gotta be tons more coming, should be a decent sub spike...at least until the nostalgia wears off and the true diehards remain
---
I'll believe it when I see it. I'm a diehard fan as well, but my trust is limited in these times.
---
Devs shouldn't even consider hardcore players being bored for their release schedule. 
---
I don’t think businesses do “passion projects” tbh
---
Also not OP, but loot trading may make its way in.

Heart of the Wild Druid.

Me too! My buddy and I want to take a week off but we need official dates!!!
---
That's the most Vanilla story I've ever heard and I love it.

The short answer is no. You will not explode because you aren't a troll. Troll rogues are way better then people make them out to be. Most of your damage is from white hits on a Rogue. Especially in pvp being able to jack up your DPS by 20% suddenly while you re-establish your stun lock is pretty strong. 
---
Are Trolls the best race for pvp certainly not. That being said for the rogue class specifically. They are way stronger then people like to credit them for.
---
I think the issue is that the damage is so weak that it really turns the class into a middle tier leveler, behind hunters warlocks and mages. They are very efficient, have a lot of utility, but I definitely feel like I kill faster as a mage, even if I have to drink a lot.
---
No, but members of the team working on it do.
---
I read the “this isn’t a normal project” to say “yes, Activision is now our overlord.”
---
Is it 25% or 30%? Is classic.db wrong?
