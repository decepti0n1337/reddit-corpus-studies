I don't join these groups and I do not make them, but if they suffer no backlash from doing so other than waiting an extra hour or so for a tank, are they really that dumb? If they don't care about the grind that a lot of us like and the struggle, and their only goal is to gear out, this is probably the most ideal way to go about it.
---

---
They could try to be sneaky about it and vet each class that joins them. A lot of plate tanks will not invite other warriors or pallies because they don't want to roll off for plate. That's literally the same thing. One is just being sneaky about it while the other is being honest and upfront. Again, I wouldn't join them and I wouldn't make them, but I have no problems with them existing and think it's smarter than being unhappy if you don't enjoy the gear grind. 
---
No idea why it upsets people so much when it doesn't affect them.
---
---
---
True, but golem has way better drop rates for items for clothies and healers. I'd rather do that personally than farm just a belt I could maybe not see in 7 hours.
---
What ends up happening is people skip items that are an upgrade so that they can get the bigger, rarer upgrade.  At first not a huge issue, but eventually this can lead to many items going to waste when they needn't.
---
It needs additional systems in place to counter that sort of behavior.  Forced bids, for example.
---
It's not like DKP doesn't work, but every system has their pros and cons and completely ignoring the flaws of one to highlight the flaws of another seems disingenuous to me.  If you wont compare equitably, then why bother taking what you say seriously?
---
I remember his 1v5 ryze video, back when ryze kind of made sense as a champion.
---
Not every guild does this. And the one's that do, evidently don't last long (a few milliseconds looks like).
---
I hope you get banned for your shiiiiit post
---
That's totally fair and i support it. I do think there good in pvp. As long as they arent the main source of damage. There ability to draw out a fight and harass is fantastic.
---
I thought this was true when I started playing... it's not true... it's not even close
---
Amazing!
---
Tanked my way from 52-60 doing BRD then eventually strat/lbrs/ubrs. Did the same thing 30-40 in Sm. Bought my epic mount with all the quests i had leftover. Had almost full prebis before i hit cap, don't listen to these people, dungeon grinding is the way to go.
---
WoD made this kind of bullshit standard. OpenRaid and that other PUG UI addon were killed by Group Finder and things haven't been the same since.
---
Starting around Blackrock Foundry the vast majority of all groups had reserves. Not typical, old school reserves like when a guild does it's official weekly raid and just needs a few more to fill out all the spots, no. That's understandable and fine with me. In WoD we got dudes starting a raid, no tanks, no heals and claiming whole tokens and BiS gear. Then there was the people making groups to sell spots. They pug with overgeared people and you'd see 2 or 3 way undergeared dudes dying every fight and then you realized, not only is this asshat reserving gear, but it's for those 2 wankers who gave that guy like 20k for their spot. 
---
I went from PUG'n Gold clear Challenge Modes and weekly heroic Siege of Org on up to 6 alts to just giving up completely on raiding on my alts in WoD, the PUG scene was such a shitshow of reserves and fail groups and Group Finder offered nothing to help put together a good, honest group. Still doesn't. Discord groups and servers have sorta filled the gap that was left by OpenRaid. It makes it easier to find good people and regular groups and stay in touch, but OpenRaid was such a perfect, glorious tool I wish Blizz bought it and incorporated it into the game.

end rant

st Vietnam earlier, group of 7+ level60s killing every low level on sight...

is that really PvP. I just wait for death and /clap spam.

ya i hadnt done a full run of ST in a while, so i dont remember what all the dragons did for CC... harsh :(

Are auction houses city or continent specific?

I noticed stuff I put it in Thunder Bluff wasn't at Booty Bay.

Ugh. Stv sucked as horde too. Just a terrible area in general.

I did the controversial thing of leaving my own raid before Rend.  
---
They didn't want to kill Solakar. Looking at you *The Nobles* @ Gehennas.
---
My buddy had 200-300g from just lvling to 60, he got some decent 100g item from a dungeon and just kept tanking. I borrowed him his last 160g but he made most of it from just tanking dungeons (No i r tank reserve loot bs either)
---
Work on your prebis - Do the quest you left in like epl/wpl if you have em and you be getting there in no time. It feels extremely easy to make gold compared to what i remembered, i dinged 60 on my first char with 1200g and like 200g on Alt. In vanilla i think i dinged 60 with like 20g on my pocket
---
Fix the default settings first. Then stop helping.
---
Friends don't let friends leave auto self cast off.
---
Booty bay is alliance and horde shared so it's different
---
Gehennas is heavier on the horde side but its relatively even I'd probably estimate 60-40 at worst, 55-45 at best.
---
But the ember stone staff is marginally better so I must have it.
---
[removed]
---
still a farmable recipe just takes far longer.
---
Oh yeah, they're an amazing support class in pvp.
---
Formula: Enchant Weapon - Icy Chill
---
Right now on my server these are listed for 20g, do you guys think it's worth holding until people have more gold in general? In wowhead and stuff people have been saying sometimes they go for 75g. Or is that too far out, like months instead of weeks?
---
This is a trend that need to stop
---
The repeated skull is that of an adult European male.
---
I'm a lot happier doing 10 minute princess runs at 60 with guildies who will stick around until everyone gets one than trudging through with 50s, tbh. Past level 50 the xp sucks, and wasn't worth sticking around for.
---
Because a healer gets more out of golem than angerforge.
---
Honestly, wait for battlegrounds to come out.
---
&amp;#x200B;

So much better than world PVP as it's in a controlled environment.
---
On PVP servers, especially starting now, you will get ganked and Camped which will ruin your experience. Most of the scumbag trolls will play on PVP servers anyway.
---
Eeeeewwwwww
---
i get a little loosey-goosey and several different groups of people have said i'm a better tank with a beer buzz.
---
indeed, and they aren't even high elves
---
the lad hasn't the faintest idea what he's talking about
---
Yea ladt night a 60 warrior and 60 druid in onyxia and mc gear was camping hillsbrad.  Not just killing and moving on but corpse camping lowbies.  I dont really care if a lvl 60 ganks someone.   That's part of the game.  But to corpse camp people and chase them down when they res is just lame
---
Yep, a proper DKP system with clear cut rules is almost impossible to game.   The ones against DKP typically are the ones who either don't show up or contribute all the time but still want a chance at getting BIS faster.
---
So you discount bad loot councils in your argument.. 
---
BUT include a random bad DPK anecdote? Lol.
---
Rogue doesn't replace Cruel Barb until close to 30, which is probably over a full ingame day played for most players.
---
There are choice pieces in just about every level bracket, that choice classes don't replace for 8-12 levels. Ravager in SM is another good example, it's the best AoE tool in the Paladin and Warrior kit until above 50, and even then a good DPS paladin will probably have one in their bags, even at 60.
---
This is a nuanced thing. There are absolutely items that groups are justified in reserving, but a lot that aren't. It really depends on the situation.
---
Edit: wrong sword.
---
Reasonable, instance maps should have been in vanilla to begin with.
---
This guy reserves mainhand and felstriker in the same run.
---
They're sort of annoying to do if you don't have a decent mage or a tank who can hold some proper aggro or a priest who can properly heal/shield a helfire lock.
---
It's so sad when people look for more for strat and reserve the righteous orbs. That's the stupidest lfg message I've seen.
---
She started on my laptop with all my addons. I told her that I really should remove all the addons for her account so that she can play with the vanilla default settings, because all the addons I have aren't helping her right now. But she told me to wait. So I'm not arguing with her
---
Agreed

I just binged every episode, these are amazing! Have subbed!

Its got to be around 20-30% now. I see one Ally toon a day. Shit some layers are entirely Horde.

Hello welcome to every tank wars carapace grind. Sit down and enjoy the ride or get off and find a different mainhand.

I'm pretty sure anyone with the Attack on the Tower quest can spawn additional ogres, by clicking on the doodads inside and outside the tower.

I was hit once, out of nowhere, by a buzzard in desolace.  Turned around, couldn't see it but it still shows as my target.  Put a raid marker on it, nowhere to be seen.  (I've noticed before that mobs can be stuck in trees, hit you once then evade).
---
A few minutes later I see my raid marker plummet from the sky, through the ground and keep heading down.  Sucks to be him I suppose.
---
I need to sleep now, but I'll edit this comment tomorrow and let you know :) Thanks for the interest!
---
And here your true colors come out. You're just someone that wants to kill people that aren't twinks and if someone criticizes you you'll resort to name calling because you have nothing else. 
---
If you're going to pretend you're quoting someone you should actually quote what they said and not make up things to make yourself sound right. I said gear that cannot be considered reasonable for someone leveling to get. Do you think it's reasonable that a level 19 would be able to get all the gear you have? No. Even if they tried they would be well past level 19 by the time they finish through the normal methods that you take when leveling. 
---
Your enchants far eclipse anything they can get. For example your bracers by default only give 6 stats and the enchant alone gives 9. Pretending that it's reasonable for someone that's leveling to constantly dump hundreds of gold into enchanting their leveling gear just shows you have no real argument. 
---
I don't really mind twinks as long as they can be honest. It's when they pretend that they're not seeking an unfair advantage and that it's reasonable for nontwinks to compete with them that I find them pathetic. 
---
The level 19 bracket suits you perfectly.
---
I do feel superior about not taking a game so ridiculously seriously that I'm going to pull my hair out nolifing and spamming content when we have tons and tons of time for classic to play out.

Relax, you'll get your pre bis eventually.  Go outside and play with a dog or something. It isn't 2005 anymore.

It will only get worse when phase 2 drops. Bliz fucked up and didn't make the server swaps faction locked based on over pop.

I love retail but still laughed at the ending, gj OP
---
&gt; You're comment on still giving tanks prio on tank gear shows exactly how little you understand about the metas I was referring to. Tanks in good guilds are wearing almost 0 defense and defense gear means absolutely nothing. Out MT is wearing a mixture of mail and plate dps gear. Things like true flight bracers, onslaught girdle, Savage glad chest ect. You know why we do this? A tanks job is about positioning and controlling.
---
Yeah, so that gear is tank gear.
---
By calling it "plate dps gear," it shows that you completely misunderstood what "tank gear" means or what I meant by giving prio to tanks.
---
Need to get that spell hit up.
---
All loot is hunter loot
---
it's not farmable because it's not on any specific loot table.
---
Nah
---
Who is ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù? You and all the idiots who bought into your bullshit nonsensical lies?
---
It doesn‚Äôt even make remote sense to say mageblade is better than eternal darkness for aoe farming. Mageblade does essentially nothing for aoe spells.
---
Don't forget they want everyone to fly in and use all their resets finding Jedd for a run that may never even fill up.

Horde whining with their 5-10% population advantage always puts a smile on my face.

"Calling you out" relax there Texas Ranger.

Ooooh, this is incredibly devious and cruel.  Very fitting for a rogue.

Or spec into consecrate like every normal paladin and don‚Äôt get caught into a leveling stopgap if you‚Äôre not lucky enough to drop one piece of gear  from one niche dungeon

I thought it was dropped by MC trash for a super low droprate.

It‚Äôs funny because all the alliance on Heartseeker bailed from Stalagg so now both Servers are completely imbalanced.

lmao the amount of BRD runs i see (HoJ) RESERVED (Iron Foe) RESERVED . Looks like i want to run UBRS (Dal Rend Reserved)
---
I don't mind res runs. As long as they are upfront about it and don't switch to master loot without letting people know. I've been running Jed/Rend runs MH res for 3 days (finally got MH now!) and I've used approx 10-12 minutes forming groups every time. Doesn't take that long and I have yet to have someone complain about reserving it.
---
The one true RACE is Gnomes.
---
I'd quit the game if this is how I played it every day.
---
I would get no sleep played a big part. Edit after watching its not evena  very good video its pretty shit tbh.
---
Doubt it, since they made infernals not aggressive.
---
Dual spec.
---
Voiced by Danny Trejo!
---
My guild in MoP retail used to have a drunk raid occasionally.  You had to do a shot every time you died.
---
While we did kill bosses, much of the time was spent trying to kill others with boss mechanics.
---
It was hilarious.
---
You're basically entirely wrong. A fast dungeon group is going to be faster and offer better exp/h. If dungeon grinding is slower, you are playing in bad groups. Runs like ZF zombies or SM GY are dramatically better exp/h than solo leveling, grinding, questing, for just about all skill levels. 
---
At level 55, there is legitimately 0 use spending any time outside of instances, unless a questline offers a BiS piece. Angerforge BRD runs will start at 53 as well, so classes that value Prison Block+Garrison will be able to put questing off even before 55. 
---
MC can be done at 55. There's very little reason to deliberately target EXP as a goal at 55, when you can passively accumulate it while farming prebis.
---
You can heal MC and BWL (And maybe AQ too) just fine as 0/31/20. It‚Äôs not until the later raids that Resto spec is needed.
---
This might be the stupidest thing i've read in a week. You think people are reserving loot because they are hoping or trying to trick folk so they will join for the sole purpose of boosting them for their item?
---
Did it occur to you that there are a shitload of different reasons why someone would want to join a particular dungeon? Which is true for all different classes and specs? 
---
All they are fucking saying is that they don't want people to join the party for the same reason that they are creating the party. Every class has a reason to go in to any of the end game dungeons. It's incredibly stupid to effectively atleast double your time spent in any particular dungeon by having to compete for a item.  Everybody can get a group filled with people there for a different reason, and everybody is happy because they are efficient.
---
I would love to see how that "no dumbass restrictions" policy is coming along aswell, please link me your gear.
---
Most of the Onyxia attunement questline has the wrong part of the quest comments attached and even the ones that are correctly linked have misleading information like getting the crumpled note outside of the dungeon.
---
Leave group, retarded shit

With everything you‚Äôve done, are you sure it‚Äôs actually ElvUI causing the issue?

There is a regular flight path in moonglade separate from the free tb one. Just south off the path towards timbermaw

* A key: Ring

* W key: Mid finger

* D key: Index

Q is close and to the left of W, so likely pressed by ring finger.

2 is close to the right of W, so likely pressed by mid finger.
---
E and R are further right, so Index is used there.
---
C is by space, so Thumb hits that.  
---
It's a layout for minimal finger movement and quick reactions.
---
Yea fuck that moron. What you did is the epitome of standard raiding etiquette. If you give bindings to PuG's your guild members (hopefully you run a DKP system) will probably quit. If you aren't clear with your looting rules upfront, you will be accused of ninja'ing. If you don't recruit PuGs, you most likely will not have 40 people online to run a pure guild MC. You have no choice but to run raids like this in the era of 40 man raids.   
---
This guy is most likely a retail kiddie who is used to PuG raids, solo loot and is too toxic to maintain a guild relationship.
---
In classic? Yeah, kinda.
---
Kinda like round robin. You roll for a starting order. When an item drops you look at the list and ask the top person if they want it, or skip down to the first applicable person. When you take an item you go to the bottom.
---
&gt;Ask Mark Kern.
---
sure, whats his email?
---
That seemed to be caused by their stupid auto moderation system where if people report something enough it gets auto banned. Combine that with a 3 day GM ticket queue and you get an abusive shitshow.
---
Had to shop it since it was super hazy and hard to see many of the details.
---
I initially kind of hated that quest since roughly half the mushrooms sicknessed me every time. When I wrapped it up later I think I didn't get a single debuff on any of them.
---
Hmm what would you pair with enchanting I thought that tailoring would be convenient since I'll be getting some cloth in the dungeons
---
It‚Äôs a matter of retraining your vision and mental priorities. It‚Äôs easy to just focus on health bars and miss out. I would say start trying to get in the habit of moving your eyes around the screen. Check your action bars to see CDs, check your own unit frame for mana, look at your positioning, check health of party. Cycle through regularly. At times of high damage you‚Äôll have to just switch to health bars. But while a heal is being cast you can quickly run through your progression or at least part of it. It‚Äôs a new way of thinking from DPS for sure, but I found it very rewarding when I first tried it out and now can‚Äôt quit healing.
---
I‚Äôm just saying, if you ‚Äúreally‚Äù want a unique dungeon drop to yourself in the 20-50 range.. make a group and ensure no one in the group can use the item. I mean for gods sake, want ravager? Make a group with a Druid tank, priest healer, (choose 2) mage/hunter/lock/rogue dps. Really not that hard to make a reserve run without being an identifiable douche on your server for spamming for more for a reserve run in /1, /2, and /4
---
Because we don't have much else going on. There's also plenty of people like this in NA but in Europe it's way more prevalent.
---
Doesn't mean the dungeon is challenging, but some people are challenged already at the login screen :)
---
Oh, really? I knew the elemental 30/0/21 spec worked well for healing, but didn't realize and enhance spec could as well
---
How can you not find something under 100ms? I‚Äôm living in London, Ontario and play west coast and my average ping is 70. You should be guaranteed a ping under 100 ms If you picked an east coast server! Good luck fellow Ontarian!

Of course nobody is forced to join his group, it doesn't make his behavior any less scummy. And how am I acting like a victim exactly?

I'm saying we shouldn't encourage this type of behavior.

There could be a conflict with another mod. If you have the patience, try disabling all other mods and try running it alone. If it works, slowly re-enable your other mods.

---
&gt;it was a pug a guild setup.
---
What? If you're going to correct someone at least be coherent.   
---
Most guilds who run 40-man raids will recruit non-guild members to fill spots after stating a reasonable looting policy. It is incredibly hard to get 40 people to be online every week unless your guild is massive. Unless your guild has a joint-DKP agreement with another guild to pool members, you're going to have PuG's in your 40-man raids.
---
Yes, this is anecdotal but I find passive mana regen is good enough to go from mob to mob and be effcient, though I powershift a lot so i'm using innervate on CD
---
Jealous! That‚Äôs fuckin rad
---
Yeah, you just need to also have a set of healing gear.
---
It's not just about clearing it. It's about clearing it effectively and quickly and wasting less time each week. You want to get as many people as geared as possible for the next tier, but you dont want to spend forever doing it.
---
Loot council is like communism.. it's the best choice, as long as those in power are honest.  Trouble is people are so easily corrupted, so it will never work.

As someone who lived in China, I can say that this is not how Chinese translated into English would sound, not even by a longshot.

If you're going to put time into twinking before battlegrounds are even out, then you can deal with running the dungeon more than once. I haven't checked, but is the experience stopping NPC in game yet to ensure twinks work?
---
In my experience enchanting is basically saving for retirenment. You're constantly sacrificing gold, and don't benefit from it before you hit 60. 
---
If resto isn't even your first choice, then I don't think it's worth it at all compared to your other options.

Lol at all these comments...everyone ‚Äúpro reserve‚Äù sounds like they‚Äôd kill themselves if they  had to roll on loot and compete with someone else to win.

I've had about 5-6 truestrikes drop for me, 2 felstrikers, a skullflame shield and the offhand drop before Ive seen a MH dal drop. I gave up and just use the Felstriker as my tanking/dps weapon.

I tanked 20+ runs of this in one play session just to have a rogue need it and win. He hasn‚Äôt even logged on in a week since then. Regretting not reserving it.

Thanks for your input!
---
"ohh no, we don't have 2-3 hours per week to clear MC" The time saved if you go loot council vs. DKP is maybe 30 minutes per run by the time BWL runs around... If even.
---
At 60, when you start begging tired of doing the same donjon 10 times + and you miss one or two items, yes, you start to make your group and reserve shit, make sens for me. 
---
Especially when you start to be in the same groupe as 58-59, you pretty much know you gonna lost one or two hours of you life

---
Awesome thanks I‚Äôll have to check It out!
---
Because it's lazy, petty, and pretty ridiculous.
---
The need to "reserve" something implies a form of entitlement to the item. What are you contributing beyond the other people in the group? The fact that you made it? The fact that you spammed in general longer than everyone else? What are you putting on the line that makes it "yours" and not worth an equal chance roll?
---
Tanks are probably the most guilty about that. "HAHA, I AM IN DEMAND, THEREFORE I MAKE ALL RULES!" It's honestly pretty childish, petty, and I gladly spend more time \*not\* joining those groups out of principle.   
---
Do they get away with it?   
---
Mayhap they do.
---
But I won't be the person encouraging it.
---
Reserved makes more sense in terms of loot council. 
---
Yeah - these people have been pushing progression for \*months\*, obviously some new guy isn't going to get the BiS item. Obviously the entitlement is in forming the core raid group that is well-engineered to clear the content in a reasonable amount of time. Dealing with the relationships and difficulties that come with managing a guild. Those are all things absolutely worthy of the reserved entitlement - you made the formula that works.
---
But a pug?
---
A 5 man pug at that?
---
People are borderline delusional.
---
That sucks even more- but same thing with the party ID. The check is done when you click your roll, so it can happen in world content. It's meant to be a check on players being able to use creative methods to acquire loot they shouldn't be eligible for- but it's not a perfect system (obviously). Sorry that happened to you.
---
Literally no one wants competition when it comes to items. It's just that we have to live with it most of the time. Unless you're an asshole and reserve it.

Lol ok you don't u don't Know what best in slot is, it's okay, have fun, that is the point after all
---
They're really good if that's what you're asking
---
I am level 44 and my pet is 37. Any good way to get it to catch up to my level efficiently ?
---
*gets invited to a UBRS group by a priest*

---
What if your IRL SM dungeon doubles as your PC room?
---
Wow I can only dream I‚Äôm a fair bit north and have janky ass internet so that may be my issue here!
---
It was a running meme in his irl series for WoW where he would eat raw broccoli for power. His mother even appeared and cooked broccoli stuff too if I remember correctly.
---
Skarm has a video on it. Something like "how to make gold as a tank pt 2"
---
That could very well be the case ! Now that blizzard has split their servers by region, start with the east coast severs and make some level 1 toons and the one you have the lowest ping on would be your best bet I would think :)
---
Farming blood is so weird. "Hooray! A blood! Better remove all my gear so I can get murdered now."
---
Half an epic mount on most realms.
---
this is great but i can feel the saltyness from here
---
Wowhead comments with prices from 2005 are insane compared to the situation at hand for many things, and I believe there will be months before we get to a point where inflation is even remotely near.
---
Didn‚Äôt dishonorable kills stop/hinder that?
---
0/5 cause you dont know how to take a screenshot in 2019 or you are just TROLLING
---
An odd fellow.
---
Not a hunter. But a boar is not a good dps pet afaik
---
This
---
Let's be real, they are like half a people.
---
My theory about this is always that Alliance don't care because we know playing Horde is better. They usually get more love from Blizzard, and especially in Classic it's significantly easier to play Horde than Alliance. Why would I get angry at someone for wanting to spend some time on the greener side?
---
It can have a few damage talents and still be focused on "survival" as a whole. That agility talent, for example, also improves survivability.
---
wpvp, arena is good, BGs are alright.
---
It's hard to tell whether you're on the left or the right
---
Lol
---
Hunters literally have to be engineers to farm DM tribute...
---
Fire isn't viable for MC. Frost is good for leveling because of the slows
---
It‚Äôs cool you‚Äôre still taking screenshots with a Razr.  Stickler for the classics.
---
Just so it is clear, are you saying that someone could get priority on an item from another class, even if they have missed raids compared to that person because the "formula" is only for tiebreakers?
---
Thank you!
---
Go to /2 and try to sell it, ask for offers if you're not sure what's it worth. Also good to check simillar items on AH to see where it lands approximately.
---
While warlocks are probably indeed the best for it, it just goes very well with tailoring, since eventually you'll level it by making disenchantable greens. And bc nothing else really compliments tailoring.
---
PvP happened on a PvP server? Wow what a surprise.
---
They don't realize why orbs get reserved, they just see that people do it so they want to do it.
---
If you go the alt route, make a hunter. Can effectively farm stuff in mediocre gear. They also make effective miners due to feign death/trap/pet so you can run straight for the node without having to fight.
---
The beauty of Rogues is they actually can punch up 5+ levels lol, most classes aren't really capable of doing that.
---
I feel like Rogues are just perfect for PvP, yes they're broken but there's only so much you can do, this is Classic Phase 1 after all.
---
Had a hunter that thought melee dps weapon damage is increasing his range dps. He had the epic polearm (the one that can transform) from Mc. He didn‚Äôt believe me even after everyone in the group tried to help him with itemization. We actually uninvited him in case he would roll on wrong items because he didn‚Äôt wanted to listen .
---
Alright so i‚Äôm gonna form hundreds of groups to see it drop once only to lose the roll to a 58 rogue. Seems fair
---
And still finds groups because tanks are needed lol
---
Creepy Joe and The Turd Man
---
Thank you all üòáüòá
---
We must realize that Alliance is the superior faction. We are not handed a giant base with zeppelins coming from our main city to STV. We do not even have an Alliance flight path in the entirety of STV. We do not have the luxury to run around 4v1'ing every enemy we see with no effort or skill at all required.
---
We must hide in the shadows where mobs of horde run in groups killing every low level they see. We have danger at every turn. We must be strong. We learn how to fight groups of enemies at once while they learn nothing.
---
They probably fill up and swap out people as they leave after multiple runs
---
I mean, you can believe me or not, but yes I've tanked end game content during vanilla and soon to be classic. 
---
I agree with you that it would be infuriating seeing someone win an item and they contributed nothing throughout the run, but that doesn't justify putting future items on reserve. Block the shit dps and move on.
---
Hahahaha. Engineering paid for my and my brothers mounts. My brother was a skinner/miner to try to make money. Only the most savy of players know the secret to MAKE money with engineering
---
I'm in the same boat friend, only advice to you is learn it. Use context clues, and don't be afraid to ask, this is classic and you're playing for the first time, just like I am. Most of the time they're bosses and their abbreviated names. Other times they're parts of the dungeon themselves. I'm still learning the lingo as well. Part of the fun.
---
you mean like almost every single server?
---
I ended up getting like 10 or so Horde over the course of like an hour. One poor Orc Hunter ended up taking the bait like three times (featured in the video). ChunkDaddy, if you're watching this, just know you gave me endless amounts of joy.
---
Is 56 in MC a super hard carry? Like could I even hit any of the bosses?
---
wtf.   Fuck me with a razorfist dildo.
---
Does his name start with Sw?
---
Careful. A lot of warrior tanks are actually farming their fury sets. They only tank because it makes finding groups 1000 times faster.
---
His parents are probably dead in a ditch \*pity
---
SM
---
You play fire in AQ+ maybe late bwl afaik
---
Mage 1 may have contributed more to the guild (attendance/mats/gearing other members). Or maybe the item is a PvP item, mage 2 PvPs and intends to rank, and mage 1 doesn‚Äôt. Maybe mage 1 just got mageblade, therefore the choker that just dropped should go to mage 2. There are a million reasons. The only place that rolling off loot works is a casual guild with casual players.
---
Imagine another rogue doing the same thing further down the path, mistakenly sending him the correct way again
---
Auctionator, not Auctioneer. Auctioneer is not something I'd recommend to almost anybody.
---
I see. That makes sense. Is arcane useless for everything then?
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure dishonorable kills set you back by a lot at least that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve seen on videos talking about getting rank 14
---
I mean that's true, but I am not fortunate enough to be able to avoid these people.
---
The only way I would even think about accepting this is if it was a long quest chain that required you to do almost all the content in the game and a boatload of resources.
---
The GM role was held by a council character, there was no true gm.
---
I'm not sure on arcane
---
If I won it was a fair fight.
---
If I lost it was fucking bullshit.
---
Tab out when I'm wanding. Or watch youtube lol
---
Runes?
---
What‚Äôs fires dps look like compared to frost? Never seen a fire mage.
---
hell yeah dude we out here
---
Yeah such terrible people playing the game as it was designed to be played, how dare they. If you weren't supposed to gank lowbies then zones would have PvP level brackets like in say the wild in Runescape but you are supposed to so get over it.
---
both ways can go so wrong
---
I mean technically they're robots with a curse that makes them squishy. If they didn't come out a little weird I would be surprised.
---
not at all in bwl. bosses/mobs have lots of resists or even flat out immune. aq40+ fire starts to win out and naxx its much better.
---
My interest hasn‚Äôt even begun to peak!
---
Can someone explain this to me? I have no knowledge at all of WoW affairs
---
Horde*
---
In my experience its Alliance players who are vocal about this. Its almost as if there is no difference between the players of both factions and people just like to talk about it.
---
Proofes 
---
Your opinion is invalid
---
&gt; Black Menace (dagger from Scarlet Monastery questline) hits harder, though.
---
But are you getting an SM Cath group at level 33? What about Horde rogues that don't have access to Black Menace?
---
I like this. Big ticket items like Mageblade and Legendaries should not go to someone who joined the guild that day. But at the same time, they should he eligible for SOMETHING.
---
So then can you or the guy above link any proof? So far I've seen Blue posts about layers being dynamic on the higher pop servers but nothing about only two unless they're talking about transitioning the nonfull servers to zero layers for phase 2.
---
Two time even.
---
I was a lock and someone 8 levels above me was attacking me i just kept running because i thought he would kick my ass but he kept coming so i‚Äôm like shit i gotta fight him, i wiped the floor with him. I might‚Äôve gotten a little cheesy with the fears but i did not feel one bit bad about it
---
The phrase is ["Rite of passage"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rite_of_passage)
---
(If you're going to call someone out on a mistake, at least give them the rite answer)
---
You didn't realize I was being sarcastic?  Read the tone of my voice better and take a moment to figure out if you belong here.
---
You could try this. https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/paladin-healing-gear-bis-classic-wow
---
I can't speak for Paladin, but I used Wowheads list for my warrior and it was pretty good. The only real downside I found is they list the top 2 or 3 items, but on some slots there's more than that and they're all about equally as good.
---
Tell that to the like 10 alliance killing people left and right around nesingwarys the other night on skeram. People talk of major faction imbalance and I‚Äôm just surrounded by scores of alliance in hilsbrad/stv most of the time. Skeram Horde rarely respond to calls for help either it‚Äôs kinda lame.
---
It will as long as you're marked as Dishonorable. Players are gonna thirst for kills because there's so few alliance on Skeram.
---
I‚Äôd say just start writing down names and hunting them down, get your revenge but don‚Äôt make ransoms suffer for something they didn‚Äôt do yknow
---
baby steps
---
What you're going to want to do is to remove Unbreakable's pvp video from your brain and respec elemental to be good at PvP.
---
Ah right. Completely misread that, my bad. I‚Äôve never actually heard auctionator, will have to check it out
---
Did a WC run the other day. Was like playing WoW with Cheech and Chong.
---
Good old vender strike.
---
I already been 1 shot by a rouge in thunderbluff. It's already happening
---
Btw this is why blizzard doesn‚Äôt make legendaries like these anymore. And why they took out master looter, these people are why we can‚Äôt have nice things
---
You Spec into arcane for arcane power in raids but cast Frost spells
---
Unfortunately this is the limit of intelligence for the average griefer
---
ALLY BAD HORDE GOOK

You probably haven't played that character in awhile. You can get 1.5 levels of rested experience max, it takes 10 days of being in an inn or city

---
Replace x with the rank
---
Look for the "sunder armor" debuff on the monster. If the tank has a sunder on it you're usually good to start dealing damage.
---
Hamstring doesn't actually put a debuff on bosses since they are immune to slows, it will just do a little bit of damage to trigger extra attack procs.
---
The aoe melee dps probably isnt that bad if you could proc it reliably with wing clip :p
---
Now you just need to go back a few more times for the necklace follow ons...
---
/golfclap
---
Just so you know, people like you are the reason I went from being friendly to just killing every alliance on sight.
---
And as a lock (Soul Link) I sacced my voidwalker and used fel domination in conjunction with threat chaining to get to the otherside with relative ease.
---
He means, mount is reserved to the tank that they are looking for, right? lol
---
That is wpvp though, if you were expecting fair 1v1 battles of equal level and gear at full health and mana you were mistaken. And no I'm not a ganker, I just understand how pvp servers work.
---
Yeah and this is why we DKP. Mage 1 just bought the Mageblade for probably all he is worth. Because every other mage will have bet all they are worth on it. Mage 1 won, because he was attending more and thus had more DKP. Mage 2 receives the shoulders, because Mage 1 has no DKP anymore.
---
I almost didnt leave a comment because I think 1 simple google search could've given you all the answers you needed. But...   I'd suggest getting into a DM group till your round.. 42, pick up spells then go and hit Arathi highlands. You could even hit and finish the whole zone around 38. 
---
Stone talon as alliance? Unheard of...  personally I'd never touch ashenvale as alliance by that's just me.
---
I would recommend 2/31/18 for a fresh 60 build
---
"Cheesy with fears"
---
You're a lock. Use your toolkit to your advantage. Who cares if you fear an aggressor and kill them?
---
So what I said isn't wrong. Until last week we had more than 2 layers. Now we have Two layers per zone if needed. That means before the change we had layers of only Horde which I've been in.
---
10/10
---
hmm sounds like ive misunderstood ion and maybe just being the lead doesnt mean hes the cause of retail.
---
I'm looking at you, Halsey.
---
Bigglesworth, 60 Ally mage that sits outside gadgetzan North entrance right out of guard aggro range and just one shots everyone who lands at the FP.
---
Well quick strike is BIS till naxx for warriors and rogues want accuria and master Dragonslayer. Is it also good for rogues? Sure is, but it's much more beneficial to allow the warriors to get it because they get way more use out of it. I'm saying this as a rogue player.
---
And just a quick edit here. Someone that doesn't attend half our raids wouldn't be coming. We are one of the best horde guilds in the world we have people willing to show up every raid.
---
A+ machinima right there, had a few good chuckles
---
Tmorph?
---
It‚Äôs so true. I wish I chose human. I‚Äôm over the tiny character model.
---
As a priest healer who didn‚Äôt re spec holy/disc spec till 60... I feel you when you say your missing loot and a little un comfortable.. one big thing that helped me out a bunch was wait for the tanks health to get around 60%( depends on how much dps the mobs are doing to him) and then load up on your biggest heal... mine is ‚ÄòHeal‚Äô maxed rank. until I get greater heals... (Leveling my second priest atm) 
---
This allows for a big window for you to do some damage before you actually have to heal and let‚Äôs your tank get enough aggro so you don‚Äôt pull from healing. 
---
In later dungeons If things get heated and everyone starts taking damage to the point where there‚Äôs a big chance you might wipe... stop focusing tank and wait till he is one hp.. try to keep dps comfortable and alive, doing dmg for as long as you absolutely can let them till tank is going to die. Then last resort just keep the tank alive, by all means don‚Äôt let the tank die cause by the point here will only be a few mobs left and with your regen( hopefully) and the tanks armor can outstand the dps there putting out. 
---
Not much science behind it but that‚Äôs just when I‚Äôm most successful at keeping me and the group alive. 
---
For the most part it just takes time to get more comfortable and experienced at all the different dungeons and classes.  
---
at the start of classic I was totally fine with doing absolutely no dmg during a dungeon and focusing on my main role.  But now I‚Äôm always trying to do 5k or more.
---
Just be like /u/Salamikitten and kick the rogue right before killing the boss.
---
I'm salty so I report them for cheating/translation. Probably doesn't do anything but very cathartic

The orc stun racial is the best racial by a mile for pvp which is what we are talking about.

This is the real soultion to all the guys in here complaining about greedy tanks. Find a guild, be social and helpful and you won't have to deal with the pug world ever again.

We dont pretend to be above payback. That's a pretentious moral the Alliance would have.

You just triggered me.

There's a quest beside the tunnel entrance in felwood that gets you the whole way there.
---
Hmm I am curious if I will ever come across the same situation! I am up to 43 now and seems like the 40-50 levelling will be faster than the 30-40. I felt like 28-39 took absolutely forever
---
cant take the heat then pve
---
No barber means that you will stay with your appearance. People are recognizable.
---
Retail has been in the downfall for years, through many lead game designers the game still followed the same direction.  
---
  Most of the people that work in the game don't really have much say over these big designs anymore, it's all execs, market annalists and all that stupid bullshit, trying to maximize profits as much as possible while cutting as many corners as possible.
---
to truly experience this you need to also be 60 for awhile, youll experience this sort of thing on and off 1-59.
---
Alliance had the first Cult of the Dead, led by KelThuzad.
---
Well it's only happened to me once, so enlighten me. How does having a mob brought to you help you escape?
---
I say this then never actually follow through because I feel too bad
---
Even in death, she still as a thicc dumper. I just wanna lift up that flap and sniff.
---
1v1s probably arent going to be the staple of pvp once p1 drops. Imp sprint is also pretty neat.
---
Right? Might as well not even let pvp be a thing. Killing people is wrong!
---
I don‚Äôt understand what happened.
---
Its the one single tool that warlocks have available to them to get people off of them. Deathcoil barely counts because youre required to cast fear soon as you throw it out, theres not many options.
---
They spend so long looking for a healer because there is literally no reason for healers to actually run Arena + Angerforge. The only way they can get healers is by running Golem as well. I forced a ton of groups to run Golem with me.
---
I know it's their group / their rules, what I'm saying is they're a bunch of pricks if they think they somehow deserve it more than anyone else.
---
It's something that has absolutely zero affect on the gaming experience itself, it's a nice "oh hey cool, that's the baron mount" and there is no tangible reason for a person to prioritize this over anyone else, other than them having a vastly inflated ego.
---
Resto sham will go there too.
---
I don't understand, for skinning it doesn't matter who gets the kill, and getting the kill actually insures someone else will get the skin? So there is no need to worry about the devilsaur mafia then, because you can just stand in their skins ? Doesn't make sense
---
Do these dumb asses ever find anyone?
---
Yes hordes never do that :)
---
Prove them flatearthers wrong!
---
Idk what server you're playing on, but I'm on Herod one of the most populated servers and if you're advertising Arena/Anger/Golem runs with all that reserved it's gonna take you way longer than 5 minutes to fill up even if you are tanking. Everyone and their mother is looking for caster DPS and healers for those runs it's really easy to find a tank since any decently leveled warrior can tank those runs and they want all the gear.
---
So I stealthed in front of a banker. In Booty Bay, if you attack a member of the opposing faction, the guards will attack you. So they did not see me, ran up to the banker, tried to right click the banker, but instead accidentally attacked me. Basically a death sentence for them.
---
Tmorph was scrapped years ago, it doesn't even work on retail since early legion.
---
I think it's mostly based on your gear, at least for lower levels because for most classes pre lvl 25 you lack a fair few abilities that are imperative to your success in PvP.
---
Current source: My warrior sucks dicks until I get berserker stance and can Intercept
---
If only you could identify them with something like a... name. My ass you identify people by their hairstyle
---
&gt;you wanna do this kinda run?
---
You learn this slowly, the best way is just to do a few of the runs and ask questions. If someone is getting pissy at you for asking questions, they're probably not the person you want to group with anyway. 
---
Typically various runs are just variations of the dungeon while skipping certain bosses or content, for instance a "Rend/Jed" run in UBRS is killing these two bosses, then resetting the instance because the last two bosses don't drop the loot they want. 
---
Other variations are for certain quests, for instance there's a "Jailbreak" quest in BRD that tacks on like 1/2hr-1hr of gameplay to clear it so not everyone wants to do it if they don't have the quest. 
---
&gt;Skip this? 
---
Skips are really common, basically if there's a boss that doesn't drop loot or extra trash monsters, most groups will skip these. 
---
Unless you want something specific from a boss, then it's usually safe to skip.
---
&gt;Jump down that? 
---
Always follow where the group goes, but if it's a rogue/hunter/druid leading then wait for someone without stealth or an aggro drop to go ahead and follow them.
---
&gt;Do you have this? We gotta grab that at that for that. 
---
This is typically tied with keys, attunements or items. 
---
Later dungeons require keys (UBRS, BRD, Scholo, Strath) and only one person needs the key to access all the content for everyone.  
---
Attunements require every individual person to complete a quest/chain to access the dungeon, this is only for MC/Onyxia at this point.
---
Sometimes there is dungeon specific loot that is needed to summon a boss (e.g. Uruk summon in LBRS requires a head + pole from previous bosses, Kirintos the Herald in Scholo requires "Blood of Innocents" to summon). 
---
If you don't have the attunement/key/item, just let your party know so they can find a way to deal with it.
---
&gt; I'm afraid this is only gonna get worse in raids
---
It gets easier, and you get better. One or two good runs and you basically figure out everything a certain dungeon has to offer. 
---
&gt;idea what Jed, tiers, id, fresh run, ms os....mean
---
Jed is a rare boss in UBRS that drops "Brairwood Reed", it's the best trinket for a lot of classes until much later.   
---
Tiers relate to armor sets, there are currently three main tiers available at 60, Tier0, Tier1 and Tier2. Tier0 drops from dungeons like Scholo/Strath, Tier1 is from MC, Tier2 is from MC/Ony/BWL.  
---
ID or RaidID is basically a unique ID given to raid groups so that they can't farm MC/Onyxia. After you beat a boss you are locked into a raidID until it resets, so you cannot kill the same bosses again and again for super fast loot.  
---
MS = Main Spec, the spec that the person uses mostly.  
---
OS = Off spec, the spec that someone uses other times. It's common for warriors to have a tanky "main spec" for dungeons, then an arms/fury "offspec" for PvP.  
---
&gt;Can I even raid without asking for clarification after every sentence is spoken?
---
Even going to raids with people that have done this a hundred times, the raid leaders will go over what you need to do and where you need to stand. 
---
Seriously don't worry too much about it, as long as you're not the main tank or main healer in a raid, your role should be relatively simple.
---
What Rogue build do you use. 
---
I followed levelling guide using swords and find that everything has a massive cooldown (Vanish, evasion, Sprint, aggression etc) and if you get jumped while abilities aren't online you just die.
---
Seems like a one hit wonder playstyle you pop all cooldowns put out a lot of really fast burst damage and then useless for next few minutes.
---
For PVE rogue seems mediocre at everything almost no one wants you in their group because zero ability to Aoe clear and can't tank at all.
---
Based on what I have seen I'd make a mage. You have good AoE clear, you can make food, create portals and coodowns are reasonable.
---
dude you are a warlock...you can't get "cheesy" with fears. Without fear your screwed.
---
&gt; but otherwise why would anyone join a group with ‚Äòreserves‚Äô?
---
For xp, to finish quests, for random blues/greens, or because you're bored. I think those would be the top four reasons. Oh, also if a guildy/friend is in the group and you want to help out.
---
Auto it through the gate, get aggro, die and run back.
---
Trade SoC for Sanctify Aura would be better. But, enough points?
---
We used to reserve weapons and trinkets if we had to pug way back when.  Reserving legendaries and crafting mats for the guild is fine.
---
Arcane doesn't really exist as a spec, for frost you basically go full arcane then pick up all of the talents that buff your frost bolt but that isn't really "arcane" since you never use arcane missles or anything.
---
Yeah it's just easiest on the phone that is already in my hand. Why are you mad?
---
yeah but now they're all all spread out and not as easily identifable
---
I play pretty stoned and it's not an issue. The issue is playing tired and falling asleep. I drowned my shaman in the lake outside the village in the tauren starting area when I was running back to turn in a quest because I fell asleep lol
---
Whether or not people perceive it to be fine is beside the point of it being what most PuGs are doing. For instance many argue that everyone rolling need on BoE epics is a dick thing to do, but that value judgement doesn't change the fact it's fairly standard in PuGs. 
---
From what I've seen the guilds pugging people usually supply most (but not all) of the tanks and are willing to take hunter pugs, but always have 1-2 of their own. At the very least the MT is always from the guild looking for more though.
---
I'm level 45. Am I too far behind to enjoy end game content and such? Really stressing me out
---
Fire is incredibly gimped in PvE at this stage because both MC/Onyxia have heavy fire resist enemies, very few mages stick to fire at 60 at this point.
---
The Arcane tree is mostly useless on its own, it's used to support other spell trees.
---
So that leaves frost, which is good in raids, and decent in PvP which is why most mages at 60 will be frost.
---
#Toobs11958 feel free to add me ask me any questions.

"Bis" Classes??

Just wait if this guy ever does burning crusade...  if he thinks Ony attunment is ridiculous, he‚Äôs in for some bad news
---
But not for free. That was the point i was trying to say. Sorry i was unclear.
---
Which is the same thing, but worse as it excludes people who already have that piece of gear, or just want the quests.
---
incorrect. 
---
I play on RP-PvP servers. We are always alliance populated.
---
Seems to me you take the structure of rl and a video game to a whole new level of comparison. 
---
Seems to me you have no sense at being rational or intelligence to not be a douche.
---
Why is it so profitable? Seems pretty meh.
---
True, but as a fairly neutral fence sitter even I can see the left tend to fall on their own sword too much, and I've even been watching leftist-bias'd videos on Youtube and they still sound like they don't know what they're talking about.
---
The pattern I'm seeing is immediate emotional-based response. Emotions are a beautiful thing but damn they lead to some very poor and irrational decisions.
---
Does fire get better in naxx and AQ40?
---
Bro you might have some real mental issues if you cant distinguish the real world from a video game.
---
Healers have much better rings in LBRS for example. No reason to run tons of Arena Anger runs for a ring that isn't even BiS.
---
yah no... Arathi and Alterac mountains is where alliance gets good at pvp. 
---
You don't learn much about mechanics just getting destroyed over and over. Only thing ya learn in STV is how to disengage from multiple targets and survive.
---
I cant get either.
---
Create an Alliance character on Faerlina. Get it guilded with Olympus. And Try to do your quests without being ganking by a SKULL or a grp of Horde players. Good luck!
---
If you join a middle to low tier guild using loot council you're much more likely to run into problems but if I joined a top end guild I'd expect loot council with most big ticket items being predetermined ahead of time. A guild that's serious about progressing or being the "best" typically runs a very focused loot council.
---
Totem twisting my brother. Learn it... maser it! Teach potential raid leaders about it and how it will massively improve dps
---
If you've ever played RE5, the executioner theme gives me the exact kind of mental focus I need to make it through.
---

---
If you are worried about min/maxing I am pretty sure Human Rogue is the way to go.
---
But I wouldn't worry too much, any of the Alliance Rouges are good in their own right.
---
No, plenty of people who only play a few hours a week.  Even if 80% of your server is 60, that just means lower level content finally has a normal amount of players engaged.
---
Healers are dime a dozen in my realm but tanks are rare AF.
---
Yeah but in raids, single-target damage matters a lot more than aoe, generally.
---
This sounds like a job for [Captain Lakitu](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1375bdb36fd23a93567dbd8528121bdd/tumblr_mhrf606FA41rrftcdo1_500.gifv)!
---
The first thing I do when I see a piece of gear is check if I can solo it as a rogue. Its awesome
---
I can't tell if you're being serious or not. Or rather if "I feel bad for you" is genuine pity or a "I feel bad that you're not trying" type of thing.
---
It's not like this is a choice I'm making. Like I'm getting camped by someone 20+ levels on me because I'm "bad" or something.
---
i used to spare lowbies before something around 40 where i couldnt get a level a day because the ganking was absolutely unstopabble. I now engage every single horde that crosses my path, even the ones i probably cannot kill.
---
We are at war. Honor or not. Send that dude to the GY. Raiding south shores inn every Friday On Bigglesworth is more fun than any instance or raider
---
Care Bears
---
Because choosing an unusual race or class combo doesn't automatically make it interesting.
---
It‚Äôs typical horde behaviour
---
1h 30m? Don't they teach conciseness at school?
---
In my realm, healers are dime a dozen, but tanks are rare AF.
---
I mean... you are the best pvp healer in the game. I know cuz I main pally as well =)
---
No sir. Same faction same server only
---
Well this is normal. I as a healer only needed Golem. I still did Angerforge and Arena. The other only needed Angerforge and still ran Golem and Arena. The others only needed arena and still ran Golem and Angerforge.
---
Such an alliance move
---
Just proving that gnomes are the most scum race to play :)
---
What would be the second best prof to go with engineering? Would disenchanting some of the drops increase my profits substantially?
---
Sadly no!
---
47-51 were dreadfully slow for me then 51-58 felt so much faster and were more fun. 
---
I hope you have good luck finding tanks. I'm hoping more and more will level up as time goes on because warriors level so slowly.
---
True
---
Sounds like a middle schooler.
---
While questing in Hillsbrad, a level 3x Warrior was helping a level 2x Druid and invited me to help me kill the Peasants, all the while I was also collecting skulls. Turns out they were actually doing a quest that I had just recently finished (about 30+ minutes ago) and had to go into the mines next - I said I was done with my quests but I'll join in. When all was said and done, a pair of Mail leggings drop which happen to be a big upgrade for me. What do I do'? I press Greed on them because I don't want to seem like a piece of shit and Need without asking. So, a minute or so passes by and I finally get a chance to really look at the leggings compared to mine - I didn't realize how much of an upgrade they'd be. I was like "Holy shit those are dope man nice!" because the Druid won the roll. They were like "If you needed them why didn't you press Need?" explained it to them, Druid handed them over for free - I offered him 50s for his kindness but he said nope, he wouldn't accept anything so instead I talked him down to 5s. 
---
I dislike having to press Need on something just in case someone wants to have a bitch fit over it, these guys were totally cool about the whole situation though. However a few nights ago, I ran SFK with a group, 2 Warriors (myself included), Priest and 2 Hunters. Well, a pair of Healer shoulders dropped, Priest pressed Need and we all just pressed Greed or didn't want them, but not the highest level Hunter - nope he pressed Need. When asked WHY, he said "It's an upgrade for me! I was using &lt;insert shoulders here&gt; and this one is a massive upgrade!". According to him he needed them more than the Healer but later said "If he needed them why didn't he just Need on them too?" we all in unison said "He did, before anyone else pressed anything. He needed on them and 10 seconds later you did too..." he tried to apologize offering to give them to the Priest not realizing you can't. The Priest had some real shit shoulders and those would have been a massive increase to his healing abilities but the Hunter saw the 1 agility and said it was a Hunter item.
---
No.
---
Don't ever read game sub reddits and think they're at all accurate to the actual state of the game.
---
 The same way social media is not an accurate reflection of your friends actual social lives, sub-reddits are a skewed reflection of the game and should be taken with a grain of salt.
---
Ok ty I was having a mental breakdown with them releasing so fast lol I just wanna enjoy
---
Paladin, because Horde doesn't have it! (pis c'est la meilleure classe!!)
---
I did not know that
---
Villainous. I like it.
---
I'm being serious
---
Sounds like high DPS.
---
Mages are the new huntards.
---
" The last time a server in this region had more than three layers was the first week of September,  "   
---
How does that make you think there were three layers last week? It literally says the first week of September, its now the SECOND week of OCTOBER. You're off by a month.
---
Dishonorable kills are for civilian npcs only, iirc
---
People in MC usually spec Arcane/Frost to get arcane power with only 1 person being deep frost for winter's chill
---
Duskwood would be the natural progression.  Run a few Dm and then stockades runs first (lots of easy quests in stockades, wowhead them).
---
Like you died 3 times. Or got camped for multiple hours 3 times?
---
Yes.
---
BINGO, and that right there is exactly why the GM was most likely in on this scam. And when things turned against them they decided to do exactly what a petulant child would do.
---
He took his ball and went home.
---
Get good scrub
---
I saw a DPS looking for a tank and heal for Strath while locking the orbs.
---
People are getting pretty dam sick of the reserved loot
---
Kurinaxx is where I am
---
You do realise you are not pvp flagged in the barrens unless you turn in on. No one is making it to 60 with ‚Äúfuck‚Äù in their name.
---
Did you make all that up?
---
Always hordes on my server
---
Sounds like a guild problem more than anything, my guild have never started later than 20 minutes and we always have a squad ready to roll. 
---
Our first week we had to take about 5 PUGs while people finished getting 60 for a total of 32 players, second week we went 10/10 MC 1/1 ony with a full 40, 2 of which were PUGs. 
---
I never got to experience lvl 60 raiding as I joined when max level was 70 so I've been having fun with the whole experience.
---
would take 2 points out of slam (cause of gcd) and go for 5/5 2h weap spec.
---
Traitors have been know to commit treason, yes.
---
what do you mean arcane is useless? 
---
the raiding mage spec is deep arcane with some frost talents, you only need 1 frost mage in every raid and his role is to be a winter's chill bitch :p
---
That's why you just force the person to which the item is the biggest upgrade to take it when no one else wants. It's not perfect, but it's better than drama council anyday
---
I think theyre talking about human spirit
---
Experts/min maxers please chime in if I'm wrong, but the slow attack speed that makes the gut ripper so amazing for ambush and backstab crits would be bad for offhand poison application.
---
I'd use a faster dagger offhand.  I'm currently 52 and have used gut ripper main / coldrage offhand since 40... Loving it.
---
how weird, mine adds a /al command to see drops per instance, but doesn't add a tooltip. is it a separate addon or a setting inside atlasloot?
---
horde players that camp at the entrance to SM...I don't understand it...
---
ah ok. fair enough
---
Humans ftw
---
It is actually not a bad idea. I may do this for getting some gold later on. I don't need any loot from these bosses. But they do drop good gold.
---
Not a question but I got my whirlwind axe last night at 30 and thanks to the people that helped me. I'm so stoked to start playing with it once I get home from work and hopefully pass on the help to the next warrior that needs help. 
---
Are there any cheap weapon enchants for the axe or is it not worth it to put one on?
---
lol lol lol
---
You were dead serious. Don't backpedel lol
---
lol whats the song
---
Dwarf is best because they don't know fear! The bravest race in any fantasy lore.
---
I mean, once you're 60 and there's no such thing as being underleveled, only outskilled or *maybe* outgeared, it becomes under your control. But pre-60, world pvp is the biggest shitshow and serves only to generate frustration and schadenfraude. As far as I'm concerned, no two players in the history of wow have ever had a fair pre-60 fight.
---
Bindings, Eye, and crafting mats go to the guild who pug MC. If people get salty about that fuck them, they can get their own group going then.
---
Yeah as a noob I'm wondering how a level 19 item can be so valuable regardless.
---
Back in Vanilla, my friends and I used to intentionally collect dishonorable kills.  We would seek out all the npcs that were flagged as civilian and focus on them.  It was sort of like choosing to follow the Dark Side.
---
Real talk - I follow a strict "no first strikes" policy. 9/10 interactions are as simple as me having the fastest /wave in the west and we go on our way, the 1/10 are usually grouped or ??s like  you said.
---
If someone gibs me on my solo warr it's not usually that frustrating because by the time they see me I'm already dead. I'll hit up /1 with player name/level/class/location as a warning and see if anyone wants to group up and retaliate but otherwise they go on my /target macro for this purpose so I know to meet them with a /doom and a fight instead of a /wave next time. 
---
I also have a macro like "/y %t ALLY player attacking me unprovoked! Around my level, whisper if you want invite for retaliation!" that only gets used on my priest though because by the time my warr realises he's being attacked he's already dead. It's worked 2 of the 3 times I've remembered to use it though and it was great fun to have the tables turned.
---
Most importantly, if I get body camped three times in a row I just switch to an alt in another area. Let them waste their whole party's time waiting for me to respawn rather than me wasting my time running back a third time.
---
&gt;And just a quick edit here. Someone that doesn't attend half our raids wouldn't be coming. We are one of the best horde guilds in the world we have people willing to show up every raid.
---
Well, the situation still applies if the warrior only misses one or two raids, is late, or for whatever reason is putting in less effort. If you have people willing to show up every raid, then why would your system prioritize someone who misses a day based on what class they play? 
---
I also get that you are hyper-prioritizing efficiency over fairness, but most players don't feel that way. That is why most guilds break up because of either loot drama or poor leadership, both of which are exacerbated by systems in which the players don't get loot fairly based on participation.
---
I'm not saying that this is true for your guild. On the fringes of competitive guilds, things like loot drama or poor leadership are obviously less likely.
---
But you have to recognize that your situation is not the case for 90% of guilds out there. Your criticisms of DKP are not appropriate under normal circumstances, and having "normal" guilds use loot councils would be detrimental compared with DKP.
---
If we scan reddit for the next 10 raid-guild breakups, I'd be willing to be that 8 or more of them have to do with loot drama or poor leadership.
---
I have beaten 43-44 rogues as a 41-42 lock and lost to 39-40 warriors and my gear is a shit show. It has more to do with knowing how to use what you have.
---
Efficient, well routed questing is the fastest overall xp/hr (ie, that includes travel).
---
Otherwise, dungeon gives high xp/hr but that is going to be slower overall unless you are nonstop dungeoning with others the whole way.
---
Honestly the 60 dungeons use more terminology and are harder than MC and Ony. 
---
Especially because everyone is in short farm run mode for dungeons. I definitely wouldn't worry about it if I were you. Most of it you can pick up as you go. Especially the instance abbreviations. People get so used to it because theyll spend literal days of play time inside these dungeons going for certain pieces of loot, so their lingo gets more and more compressed when talking about it.
---
Why are people so damn upset about reserving items? It's a game, you can do whatever you want within the bounds of the EULA. You want to get a certain item from a certain raid? Then don't join a damn raid that has that item reserved! Join a raid that doesn't have it reserved, start your own raid group, solo that shit, there's literally no reason to be a dick just because someone wants to reserve items in the run that they're setting up. 
---
How hard can it be? Really?
---
The Rogue stealth sappers on the Horde raid was amazing
---
Demonic/dark runes. Look it up.
---
When you learn goblin it says you can never learn gnomish. But I dunno how accurate that is.
---
See.. I've never played wow before classic, and I wanted to join a PvP server. What I was expecting was like myself and and group of my alliance Bros rolling up to a dungeon in a contested zone, and there already being a group of similar level horde Bros about to go in, so we throw down like gangs of fucking new York for the rights to go in.
---
But it's just me being a level 17 mage and my level 18 warrior pal trying to kill some kobolds or some shit and there's a level ?? Undead Rogue One shotting us and then sitting invis over our bodies waiting to do it again.
---
I always play like some manager. I'm a heal, a really good heal imo. (yes I'm very convinced about myself.) I always invite the guy who I declared to be my personal tank and then build the group. I have a bunch of good DPS (including rogues) on my list and invite them first. Then I look for the rest in LFG chat. My tanks love playing with me, because the runs are always smooth. And well, finding DPS is not all that hard once you have a tank and heal.
---
That's literally all the horde do, go fuck yourself lol
---
Idiot detected.
---
It's really such a shame that sapper charges exist. Not to take anything away from APES, they pretty much are the best, but sappers are a huge blemish on large-scale PvP. It all just comes down to which side has the most swinging dicks with engineering, and every fight just consists of a three-second barrage of sappers and then it's pretty much over. There's no other viable strategy.
---
Pissy players always seem make smooth runs bumpy even if theyre good players. Some people need a serious metaphorical chill pill. They rush pulls, cause wipes, and waste time in the name of "doing it better and more efficient".
---
In her defense, I only have my desktop to play on and I would kill to be able to play while sitting on the couch.
---
Honestly it's mc. Just roll that shit who cares
---
Do you have a video by chance?
---
Wont these get you banned?
---
Unfortunately there are still quite a lot of issues with pets being broken. It's not just you.
---
Fallen or Forgotten Hero of the Horde. He sits in Swamp of Sorrows right next to the entrance of Blasted Lands. Alliance can speak to him too.
---
Coffins.. Coffins unfortunatly, are a necessity.
---
My last LBRS run gave me 30 Gold. And that was without doing stuff such as reserving trash loot for me.
---
I said "almost" every server... you're the anomaly.
---
Isn't this against the rules?
---
Oof
---
That's what you get for betraying the alliance !
---
If I was him, I would feel ashamed to stream that. No honor.
---
For example, a single LBRS weapon is already worth between 5-8 gold.
---
Fuck i just want to find 40 people like you to raid with. Too many loser neck beards play wow
---
A fellow Kirtonos native I see, we welcome you to the stabby ranks!
---
I autoran from the graveyard in desolace and literally fell asleep levelling my mage one night 11 years ago, I woke up and I died from fatigue while dead and my corpse was moved a mile into the water in fatigue land. It was quite a surprise
---
I think you need to grab a quest from Nethergarde first though.
---
this is an awesome and in depth response. 10/10 would recommend
---
Right now I'm rocking the earthen wand and it hits haaaard for my level lol I'd like jainas firstarter if I get lucky or I think it's called the naxious wand or something like that? It's a drop from one of the boss mobs in zulfarak I think I'd have to double check. 
---
 I don't and won't have shadow form untill level 50 untill I respec
---
wait, where does he prove what you're talking about?  did i miss a comment chain or something in the video?
---
I would say anything cosmetic is fine- while my initial gut went 'ew' with the idea of transmog, hear me out. They have it so that only you see your transmog. See, for me, trasmog isn't about impressing others, it's about my toon not looking like ass. However, perfectly willing to accept that this would create a transmog market and fundamentally change the Classic way of economics, so I can see why that might not be the best idea.  
---
I think aoe loot, hide shoulders (primarily for night elves) and basic barbershop stuff is fine though. Sometimes you hit level ten and hate your choice. 
---
However, once these things start to leech in, every single thing takes us further from Classic, which I certainly don't want, so go figure. If I want the above, screw me, I can just go play retail.
---
This had me rolling. Well done!
---
I really don't have a reason to make it up. I swear it said fuckhorde or something like that. Check on Felstriker, is there a way to look people up that way?
---
He could've used special characters too.
---
Also, what does i mean being PvP flagged, what does that mechanic actually do? Because the alliances I see at Ratchet are yellow but I can still right click and attack them. What's the point of PvP flagging it just makes me go from yellow to red, but still cant be killed by any Alliance? Lol
---
I remember in WOTLK I sold daylie dungeon runs for about 50-100g a pop. DD's got instant invites and I got an extra 100-200 gold. I also got my daylie dungeon and the tank bag.
---
&gt; What Rogue build do you use. 
---
Depends entirely on the weapons/gear I have available, in vanilla I was swords until I got a CHT/Perd. 
---
Then you just decide whether you're more PvP or PvE focused. 
---
&gt;I followed levelling guide using swords and find that everything has a massive cooldown (Vanish, evasion, Sprint, aggression etc) and if you get jumped while abilities aren't online you just die.
---
As a rogue in wPvP, you will typically get smashed if you are the one jumped on. Your greatest advantage is jumping on people and catching them unaware, I know this is kind of a shit answer, but rogues do not do well if they are caught outside of stealth - especially by classes that can apply DoTs.
---
This is why I hated duels (and to a lesser extent, BG's). Because they never really simulated that sort of feel, you always know a rogue is nearby when you duel one and you're ready for them when they ambush/CS you. In some cases people would spam AoE abilities to reveal you, which is kind of a shitty move imo. 
---
But in the world, that's never the case, you can't underestimate the pants-shitting effect a rogue has popping up on a squishy that just finished killing a mob and is quietly eating their meal. Even if they could have gotten away, chances are they panicked and messed something up and died before they realize it. 
---
&gt;For PVE rogue seems mediocre at everything almost no one wants you in their group because zero ability to Aoe clear and can't tank at all.
---
In basic dungeons you still want rogues for melee damage as there will generally always be magic immune mobs, counterspelling mobs or something that silences you. Sap, distract, lockpicking and the ability to scout are invaluable tools in dungeons and anyone that looks down on that is braindead. 
---
In late game PvE, a rogue should never lose out to anyone in DPS raids except for very specific encounters (or kitted out warriors).
---
&gt;Based on what I have seen I'd make a mage. You have good AoE clear, you can make food, create portals and coodowns are reasonable.
---
It always seems that way, but what's never shown is the 30s-1m downtime between pulls.
---
The constant buffing/food/water/gem spam.  
---
The deaths from mobs queuing up attacks and slapping you dead with 3-4 insta hits.  
---
Don't get me wrong, mages are incredibly fun to play, but the downtime is significant while a rogue can simply bandage up and be ready for the next encounter.
---
Why is it significantly easier to play horde than alliance rofl?
---
53 ally here who mained horde previously
---
It's just a new dungeon, shouldn't freak about that
---
Ahhh the elusive retard pvp strategy
---
Why is this a post? Who cares.
---
I am 43, and only level with a partner player who plays less.  It helps to be on a low pop relaxed realm, but just ignore the extra noise and enjoy that there will be less loot competition when you do get to 60.    DM is probably releasing too soon as the popular opinion seems to think. 
---
IMO its really just so that the next phase (with pvp system) isn't overloaded, not because there is a content drought.
---
Battlegrounds didn't give experience until cata, pretty sure
---
I was there, good times!
---
Here's a link to the 1.12 spell coefficients which I don't believe were taken from private servers and in my own testing seem accurate (For a frost mage);  
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/95abc8/list\_of\_spellcoefficients\_1121/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/95abc8/list_of_spellcoefficients_1121/)  
---
You asked about crit as well though, and from what I've read they do scale but, the obvious way to test would simply be to find a mob, equip crit gear and look at the meters or compare your average crit % from the meters to your actual crit (over a long duration fight or "overall" damage from your meters). Details! Damage Meter is very in depth and will show you any information you'd want to know and, if you don't want to add the crit up manually, DejaClassicStats (with the exception of any additional crit stemming from talent points placed) will do so for you.  
---
Hope this helps!
---
I'll tell you why. Because if hamish kicked anyone. Our entire guild would have left and rejoined with pronkers anyway. Hamish is a bottom tier player that got mad he was being pushed out of leadership because he's fucking clueless.
---
Experience stopping npc is not needed since battlegrounds didn't give experience until Cataclysm
---
Sucks for horde too, it is basically a PVE server now. No clue why Blizz hasn‚Äôt taken any faction balancing measures.
---
I still end up in zone layers that are all Horde. So some layers being all Horde is still correct. Just because you want to me be wrong because only two layers exist per zone doesn't make my comment wrong. You can still have some layers be all Horde on the full servers.
---
My server isn't a single layer server it's a two layer per zone based on Population. Some of those layers are literally all Horde. My comment about Dynamic layering is wrong and out of date but not my comment about some layers being all Horde.
---
True, but I can still say no to groups with three priests in it lol.
---
For twink characters when PvP battlegrounds drop is phase 3.
---
Well we have my gaming desktop, my gaming laptop, and her newer regular HP laptop. All capable of playing Classic at highest graphics and framerates. So she has options.
---
Bis tracker
---
Mouseover macros, especially ones with modifiers so they cast different spells on alt or ctrl are fucking amazing for this. Additionally healbot is awesome. 
---
I recommend using healbot or unit frames like luna or zperl that you can move them around so they are closer to where you want to be looking. Having to look all the way to the left of the screen to heal is very distracting.
---
Also that random black dot. I saw it after i zoomed in and though it was dirt on my phone.
---
People make characters and keep them at 19 with the most powerful gear possible to play BGs. Shadowfang is the best dagger hands down for those characters.
---
Get 2H- impact. it's got a nice glowy cloud that looks cool, and the slight dps boost will be helpful if you plan to have the weapon for a while.
---
It's also pretty cheap, buy the mats yourself off the AH and get the whole thing for under 2-3g or less depending on your server
---
I'm unsure. I know blizzard used to not care. All I know is some streamers are using them, and blizzard doesn't seem to do anything about.
---
I didn't bitch about anything in this thread.
---
I'd wager people who spend their time ganking lowbies and trolling in general literally have more mental issues than those that don't.
---
We have no way to empirically measure this, but my hunch is that this is true.
---
Also, observing how people behave in online games can absolutely give you valid insights into human behavior.
---
I hardly gank people my level unless they:
---
1. kill or attack an ally
---
2. inconvenience me enough
---
3. attack me
---
Y'all act like Horde rogues and druids don't spend their free time in Redridge
---
*laughes in PVE server*
---
I mean a lot of people are alright with this. We did it as well on our Guild run with Pugs. Pugs get a good chance at getting good loot, our guild supplied the raidlead, building up the entire raid, the majority of the healers and explaining all the trash and bosses. 
---
Though we advertised it in the LFG and didn't just say it at the beginning.
---
Would a group finder without porting you to the dungeon be such a horrible thing? Lol
---
Yeah.
---
Thank you. Even without knowing what he's saying (no translations), that is saddening to see. I hope whoever is on board with the decision making on Activision Blizzard sees this.
---
I mean in classic Horde have a Zeppelin 2 flight paths, and a big village right in the middle of the zone.   Alliance to even have a place to repair besides Nesingwary's camp and Booty Bay.   Flight path is Duskwood or Booty Bay.
---
can't bubble while silenced.
---
A good rogue can win a 1v1 with an even bigger level difference than 5 levels below lol
---
Yep had one too just in case, saw one person coming towards me while doing the same boss as OP and was almost shitting myself until i saw its a hunter who cheered at me
---
I went to STV last night at 29 thinking it was the natural progression from Duskwood. 
---
After killing a few lvl 33-35 hordies to I could stealth between kills safely they finally had enough and camped me for about... two hours. I kept escaping because I had stealth but every few moments another would show up and invariably I'd either have to run and hide or get caught and die. 
---

73 undead clears to get my cape, lost the 2 rolls before that and just started running mostly guild with it on rez for the last 20 or so

That is where all young jedi collect their first crystal
---
Yes. It's definitely punishable. And they take it seriously, so don't make a big deal out of it like I did. It's considered "exploiting" which will nab you the same kind of bans as "hacking".   
---
  
---
If you make a big deal out of it and do stuff like posting videos with your character names on screen, or talk about it in chat, a GM might follow you around invisibly and ban you. It's *especially* likely if you do shit like using wall walking to get on roofs and shit while flagged in order to gank classes without decent ranged attacks
---
Sounds bad but still very nice to spend some time with the spouse but separately doing your own thing
---
Tbf, I'm a healer and I don't need Reed. I don't think I need a lot of other stuff from this, but I don't need the Reed either.  There is a way better item in Dire Maul.
---
I hope you're talking about being lvl 60 because leveling combat is 100% the way to go. Also congrats on assuming 1v1ing is the absolute pinnacle of WoW gameplay, some people spec for actually being useful in PvE, and just find themselves in the occasional PvP situation

Possibly? I'd recommend looking it up as Alliance since I'm far more familiar with the Horde side of things.
---
Is ashbringer a fresh server? I started classic late so no idea. I don‚Äôt think people consider it one of the lower pop realms as it‚Äôs always high and occasionally has small queue
---
This here.
---
It costs a good chunk of your mana and you'll be failing to do as much personal dps but it's a HUGE buff for the melee group if you can get the timing down properly. Losing out on personal DPS isn't that big of a deal anyway since a decently geared Enh will typically be pushing threat dangerously close to the tanks hate if they're going balls to the wall anyhow.
---
Lots of people just dont understand how invaluable a good Enh Shaman is for raids, mainly because it take a good bit of finesse and timing but done well you will be bumping your rogue and warrior groups DPS by 10-15% easily just by auto attacking and twisting.
---
even after vanilla it took me 900 runs to get the damn thing to drop and that was after they increased the drop rate

It's the cycle of life.

What is that addon that makes the bars in the upper left look like that?
---
Anyone who has better gear than me i a no life virgin that weighs 700 pounds

Anyone who has worse gear than me is a retard so bad at the game they might as well suicide RN
---
As a Druid i can handle mages a few levels higher than me, i think it comes down to mages forgetting that frost nova and polymorph doesnt really help them against druids though.  A couple weeks ago a mage 6 levels above me started attacking me while i was AFK and i was still able to get back in and kill them.
---
Worked...
---
It's not that it gets better, it's that AQ40 monsters don't have ridiculous fire resist (In some cases Ony/MC mobs are completely immune to fire making it useless for those fights). 
---
In general, the DPS of fire is WAY higher than Frost due to three significant factors:
---
- Fire spells have higher base damage and apply a DoT  
---
- Ignite proc is essentially a 40% damage boost on crits   
---
- Fireball maxxes out at R11 (561 to 715dmg +72DoT) while Frostbolt maxxes out at R10 (429 to 463dmg) 
---
Fire is good, it's actually fucking amazing for PvP right now because you fire off AP + PoM + Pyro and insta kill a lot of classes because all the BiS gear is for PvE and offers very little in terms of PvP.
---
While fireball has a slightly longer casting time, it also has longer range and a DoT so there are some really good benefits in PvP too. 
---
So basically fire *is* better, it's just that the two available end-game raids right now make it almost useless. BWL doesn't help either since most of the enemies are dragons or variations of fire-resistant monsters, so it's going to be later until ZG/AQ that you see fire mages come out in numbers.
---
That whole server is fucked when they decide to start farming honor

Thank you, will look into this enchant

My money is on swolebenji, sounds like the same neckbeard I've encountered in the wild on skeram. Only he corpse camped by sub level 53s and layer swapped, it's a shame he deleted his vod of that.

It's boring for a lot of people, including me.

I find sports and games fun when they're competitive.
---
If they aren't competitive, there's no "winning", so it's just boring.
---
Noxious shooter is from the first boss in mara orange and hits like a fucking tank. If you have some higher level guildies, I definitely recommend getting this asap (lvl 46). If you're horde on Skeram hit up Indolent sometime and I'll hook you up with a run to get that wand. Jainas firestarter is dope, but its very expensive on the AH. There is a white lvl 40 or 41 wand you can buy from the wand vendor that does decent dps until you get noxious shooter. 
---
I also highly recommend respeccing at 40. Shadow form is noticeably faster for leveling and really helps with wPvP.
---
A few days ago, my guild (amnennar server) ran it‚Äôs 2nd molten core.
---
They downed Garr, and the right part dropped. Everyone was pump up, cheering and all, and they agreed it would go to our MT.

Then, they killed Baron... and everyone lost they mind, our discord server became a mix of cheerful screams, ‚ÄúWtF‚Äù and ‚Äúyou lucky mother******‚Äù
---
Great times
---
&gt; what do you mean arcane is useless? 
---
Mostly useless on it's own.
---
Take presence of mind for example, if you focus purely on arcane there's literally no spell you can use (besides poly) with it. 
---
This is why I mentioned it supports other trees, even if you have 31pts in Arcane, you are still going to be firing off mostly frost/fire spells.
---
Yeah I have a lot of guildies and friends to run with... zero competition. Just have had no luck with a damn drop. Good luck to you! I‚Äôm hoping I can get it this week... damn thing is BiS for a while for me üò£
---
It‚Äôs funny seeing a horde baby complain about unfair WPVP
---
That‚Äôs just called a typical horde player
---
With the list no one can blame anyone but themselves. Dang guess you should have put it higher on your list if you wanted it over that guy. You are right though, we don't attract players who would think differently than we do. We have players from retail who are new to vanilla and most get with the program or leave, the ones that leave tend to want to come back because they go to other guilds and realize that having an organized and efficient guild is a lot better than they thought despite the content being easy.
---
Like I said in some early posts we are just adults and don't wanna fuck around and waste time cause we have real world responsibilities.  A good chunk of us have been raiding for years on pservers and saw the benefits or being efficient especially as content stacks up so we strive to do the best we can.
---
I have no idea. Just took a quick clip from some YouTube club music video.
---
Honestly, rogue distract shenanigans is the only thing that makes me want to create a rogue. I hate energy, but that just looks fun.

Hahah I know right, what's a good pvp experience? A 3v1 experience.

What are the must do Warrior quests at 36-42? Something that gets me a good upgrade or really good money for my mount (I‚Äôm at lvl 36 atm with 38gold). I already have the warrior 2h axe weapon from the warrior quest.
---
You dont think its as simple as someone wanting to blow some steam and relax for the day? How many people do you know like playing games on easy and not worry about difficulty in video games? ganking lowbies is no different.   
---
Its silly to try and tie this into "valid insights". People who go around murdering civilians in GTA5 arent going to commit mass murder, just how those that go around ganking lowbies arent kicking kittens while walking down the street or something. Its video games.
---
you are the biggest of pussies sir
---
Oh, that is pure evil.  I love it.
---
thats the human paladins name lol
---
I only gank people when someone ganks me in the middle of something and I need to even the score, otherwise I just wave or jump over people. A lot of Alliance are cool. To add to this I see more cheeky paladins than rogues out there.
---
Also in Arizona! On Rattlegore
---
Thing is if you get passed the gear even a good warlock has his most powerful tool taken away. And a mediocre lock will get wrecked. There are a few panic buttons like hearthstone and voidwalker sacrifice, but imo that‚Äôs often just prolonging the inevitable unless you can burst hard.
---
Also dwarf priests with fear ward.... Such a pain
---
Yes
---
Layers aren‚Äôt per zone, there‚Äôs your problem. The rest can be cleared up with the link the other fella provided.
---
"pvp"
---
Because NO CHANGES. and all pvp nostalgia nerds wanna be horde for WotF and Orc stun resist. While these are the best pvp racials, classic competitive PvP is more a competition against your own faction than the opponents.
---
Yellow means you can attack them but they can‚Äôt attack you. Red means they can attack you.
---
So if you see a yellow alliance and attack them, then die? That‚Äôs entirely your own fault.
---
This looks freakishly close to my own UI
---
wtf are you talking about with "zone layers"?
---
So I was told from another that atlas loot has dungeon maps?!! I couldn't figure it out I only see the dungeon list to choose from and what not. Does anyone have a good video showing how to work atlas loot?  I would also like to know what the numbers mean that show over the item portrait.
---
Blackrock-US. Tarren Mill ‚Äò04. Never forget.
---
Grouping with people on the same quest. Playing with friends, making a new alt everytime one of them joins in on the fun. Because it dangerous to go alone.
---
Randomly finding a hordey in the world, and fighting it out, because wpvp. Even helping higher leveled characters fight off the horde in Darkshire, knowing full well you'll die trying to cheap shot/gouge that warrior attacking the ally clothie trying to fight the other clothie. 
---
And the most fun, casually logging on throughout the week and seeing people you saw and did dungeons/quest last week. Seeing other peoples progress throughout the world, by that little interact you had in the early levels.
---
I think most people agree that both Alliance and Horde have rampant overleveled ganking, but I'm starting to think the Horde whines about it way more. lol
---
Snutz, payo, bobka or another rogue I can't think of his name. Maybe it was Vek?

But probably snutz.

You're just the worst kind of person.

I had a guy in my ZF group try and run towards Gahz when the rest of our group was going towards the temple. He says ‚Äúwe aren‚Äôt doing speed clear?‚Äù. I‚Äôve honesty never even heard of that so I ask what that is and he says we skip the Temple clear around the pool for xp and that‚Äôs it. Everyone in our group is like no man we are killing the final boss, so he stays stealth while we 4 man the temple and says he can‚Äôt be bothered with idiots and hearthed out
---
Minority though. You should probably inform your healer.

Escape Artist, Evasion, Sprint, Vanish. You'll never catch me
---
Hey mate. I really like you're dark unit frames and bars. And font. Mind sharing their names? Cheers
---
I'm curious about this line of reasoning. 
---
With this logic, you need on anything worth money since it's free gold right?
---
Well no, since a couple of gold isn't worth needing over someone who can use the upgrade. So it's only valuable items.
---
So where is the line? 10g? 50? 100? Who decides this? Why do they get to decide that arbitrary value?
---
Being scummy isn't against ToS, scamming people is. If you *EXPLICITLY* agree to terms, and break said terms,. that's scamming.

Azmingold nuff said
---
You feel like you‚Äôre in an all horde layer because the server is heavily horde favored.
---
Fuck off.  Would you make a skinner with finkles roll and give away the pristine hide they just skinned off the beast? If so you are an asshole.
---
Insert /train here :)
---
You use a shield against hunters, rogues, warriors, and sometimes against druids. Otherwise, you would lose those matchups easily.
---
I have literally never seen the word "prizing" before. This is creepy.
---
F
---
Why? 1% is roughly worth 32 attack power. 26 agility is 52 attack power and 0,5% crit. 
---
52 - 32 = 20
---
20 attack power is better than 0,5% crit.
---
It's what we do.
---
Thank you for what you know I have not played enough to reach that type of gear yet TY
---
I hope I‚Äôm not the only one, but I have no issue with people higher up ganking me. If they spawn camp that‚Äôs one thing, but if they come by and gank me I‚Äôm like whatever and keep on questing. I signed up to  a PvP server for ganking, questing, and BGs. The nice part is later on when I‚Äôm higher level I get to gank the dude who ganked me! It all comes back around.

I've rejected a few people for being black listed, it's not that I think I'm hot shit, just if your name comes up from another raid/guild member as being on someones black list, why take the chance? It's not like I can't find a replacement, so if someone says you are no good, I take them at their word. 
---
It's sort of like a no-fly list. I have no idea how or why you are on the list, just that you are on it. I'm fully aware that half the people on the list are probably there for arbitrary or stupid reasons, but again, why risk it. Everyone, including myself, is replaceable, so having a marred reputation, whatever the reason, is enough to preclude you. 
---
Boy does it cause drama though.
---
I said generally. NPC's in GTA are entirely different.
---
I agree that a big element of ganking lowbies are very casual players who cannot PVP competitively, so it's their only opportunity to kill other players.
---
But I think a sizeable amount of it is people who **enjoy wasting other players time and upsetting them**. They specifically enjoy that aspect of it, and that aspect alone.
---
People who have that mentality, aka trolls, are going to very commonly have negative mental attributes.
---
No matter what your opinion on the matter is, that is absolutely the truth. Trolls tend to be dicks, and it is 100% trolling.
---
I've seen this too
---
Thank you brother.
---
Yes! You can. Exalted with anyone of your own faction will allow you access to their mount.
---
You left out the part about waiting in a queue for 8 hours to play on that server!
---
But seriously that sounds like a fun moment , I hate my server I wish I had the patience to wait in queue to play on a better server...

I feel like 1c would be more of an insult than anything

I did the same with butcher fuck what people say you‚Äôll get another drop!! Keep grinding brotha

---
In general, you have closer access to dungeons, greater access between the continents, and on average more quests per zone as a Horde player. On PvP servers it becomes even easier, as lots of PvP servers tend to skew Horde, and once a server skews to one faction it becomes miserable for the other.
---
There's even further advantages here and there, but they're generally small in comparison to the ones I listed. The big benefit Ally has over Horde is the cooking recipe shop, and that's about it.
---
I‚Äôm level 32 and currently trying to quest in STV... I have to wait til 3 am to get anything done (I‚Äôm a bartender so the late night grind has become a staple)... still can‚Äôt get anything accomplished during regular hours tho

Weapon skill doesnt work against players.
---
As a moonkin main, I have a lotta people say that

This one person didnt agree on passing on gold. Sure its kind of a dick move but by definition wasnt ninjaing. If you really want the recipe you can just buy it off the ah for 75g.

Everyone has a price on if you want to be nice or if you want the cash.
---
If i was in the group i would have rolled need without a second thought. In my mind you are not any more entitled to the loot tham i am, regardless of professions

Yup man if you study the skill ranges you can kite like a legend
---
Personally I don't believe there is ever a reason to run loot council unless you're pushing for world firsts.  That doesn't seem to stop people though. Some people legitimately believe that they will gear up their raid in a better fashion through loot council, others believe they can avoid loot drama by using loot council, others have dark motives seeking to gear themselves and their inner circle up faster
---
35 warrior looking to do some quick SM runs. If I'm using a 2 hander and going dps, what's the best dmage output?

If there is more then 2 people, just sweeping strike + cleave?

Solon mobs stack SA and hamstring fish?

3k gold?

This is precisely why I gave up pvp servers and never looked back. They're griefing servers more than anything, and ruining someone else's fun isn't fun for me. It's stressful to have that happen to me, and I don't understand the appeal of inflicting that same stress on others.

---
oh BTW you are welcome, you should be thanking us for having spent hours a day wiping on these bosses to make that happen for you
---
I once stealthed near nessingwary (sp) and saw about 5 alliance teaming up on one horde. I feel bad about ganking people since I know some people can‚Äôt play a ton and lose out on valuable playtime corpse running. But when I see someone else doing it I make sure to step in.
---
Garrisons obviously.
---
Yep, the only problem at the moment is the faction imbalance on PvP servers.
---
If I'm ever dungeoning on my mage I just make the water I need beforehand
---
The worst blatant favoritism you can see in Horde (besides racials) is getting max fishing level.  All of the fish you need are right next to Horde flight paths, horde get a fishing quest that gives extra fishing bonus, the best fishing pole Alliance can get is found right next to horde town in Desolace.
---
I just let them raw dog me repeatedly ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
If it‚Äôs a pug , everyone rolls need on anything of high value. That seems to be the standard procedure. 
---
Unless it‚Äôs something worth hundreds of gold I usually pass if someone actually has immediate use for it.
---
This looks like me playing right now. I sometimes play on the desktop but sometimes it just has to be the laptop. I wish my husband would play.
---
Lvl 58 warrior here, currently with 8 days played ant 275 minning + blacksmithing. Do the dungeons.
---
The key to the mafia is that they have people on both factions.
---
So if you stand in their skins, someone from the other faction will come along to gank you and then they skin it.
---
This is the same kind of arguments people would get into on the WoW forums 15 years ago regarding pvp. There's the suck it up, pvp server guys, and then the "higher morality" douchebags who think ganking is a morality issue. 
---
Nothing's changed lol
---
Not only the best,  it's the best by a fucking MILE and the drop rate is crazy, stupid, brokenly low.
---
Back in the day I literally farmed for a month strait to gear up a twink and still never got it to drop before a buddy in my guild at the time spent a week and had it drop so he did me a solid and sold it to me for a cheap 400g (It was going for 1200 at the time) as a favor.
---
Cool dont join, make your own group and enjoy finding a tank for strat.
---
You lost this battle friend.  Good effort though.  Catch ya on the flip.
---
I appreciate that
---
Don't tell anyone, but I'm playing alliance on a second server because I really miss paladins.
---
Hello, do i have to do every quest ? i outlevel most of them quickly Thanks !
---
I haven't ever played on a server where horde didn't outnumber alliance. And every time I'd level up there would be relentless ganking from either high level or multiple horde. Right now in classic I have to sit inside SM to form groups and cat form sprint into different ones to not instantly die there. I personally don't attack horde unless they attack me first, and even then I'd rather cat/travel form out and leave em in the dust. Lol
---
Its just laziness. Policing Ungoro would create work for them that can't be easily automated.
---
I've run Uldaman a good 10+ times and I haven't once seen a group roll for the chest at the end.
---
Are there any encounters in the Classic that Luffa helps with? I sold mine last night...
---
You decide it personally. There‚Äôs no secret rule where anything over 8 gold 57 silver should be considered a valuable item. 
---
If I was some rich fuck, I wouldn‚Äôt really care over some 50g BoE that dropped and would let someone else grab it. But maybe I‚Äôm a level 38 scrapping every bit of gold possible for my mount. Damn right I want my chance at that item.
---
Ah yes.

It's not that.  As /u/broforceone said, every time someone clicks a box in the tower it spawns adds.

That's what I thought. Your illogical bullshit wasn't fooling anyone.
---
It is world pvp just... closer to a hunter soloing Mara. It‚Äôs world pvp in the game but it‚Äôs a boss v raid situation. There‚Äôs a good post somewhere around here where he RP walked around waiting for an Ally raid to build up
---
One dot and you're at half.
---
I play on the morning. I usually just afk while doing other stuff so I dont have to wait for the queue.
---
Idk why but this made me think if there‚Äôs an account out there that‚Äôs done literally EVERY quest possible and I‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs like 2.5k of them in vanilla.
---
Heard you need like 40 characters to do this bc of the exclusive racial/class combo exclusive quests but knowing the dedication of this fan base I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised it exists somewhere
---
That is exactly what it used to be worth.
---
Jesus man, there was no answer needed from someone like you. Just leave this thread alone and enjoy yourself for once. I am playing and leveling while replying to these comments and you are the only one out here who needs to make some sort of point to me. If the mods delete my post then so be it.
---
As a alliance warlock, I've started murdering everything in sight in that God forsaken jungle. It's actually quite pleasant to level like that. Helps that locks are undisputed champions of 1 vs 1 battles as long as they don't jump me from stealth. 
---
Unlike my punching bag 36 warrior, who didn't fare so well. So I kinda hold a grudge.
---
Oceanic. It seems like all the chill people bailed to Yojamba or Felstriker, leaving Arugal the server of concentrated crazy.
---
Questing in =/= as getting to it, it's also attached to an alliance questing zone whereas Horde have no other option lol
---
It‚Äôs just a meme man, chill.. noone said sub is better for PvE
---
That's nice. I'm going to go gank some horde in stonetalon now.
---
You severely overestimate the mental maturity of people 18 years old and over
---
give the medal to horde too
---
Heartseeker must be 3:1 ally to horde ratio
---
Yeah definitely fight is favored in high level favor but keep in mind I can still win, I‚Äôm level 48, a 36 warrior (I‚Äôm a Druid) I was just messing with /waving at hit me for half my health in one white crit hit (no moves‚Äîactually one auto attack) ps I‚Äôm wearing almost all blues above level 40
---
A lot of quests become pretty trivial when no one's farming that area and you overlevel the mobs by 20 levels.
---
But yes, some people enjoy being a little nutty.
---
Ofc the tank is the party leader...
---
Who do you think starts the "tank gets all the free loot group" ?
---
Being masterlooter is tedious.
---
Just group loot and if someone needs on something they don't need kick em and continue.
---
Mark a skull that you and dps will focus, you will white swing him and swipe the others. Maul if you have extra rage.  Tab target and keep FFF on all of them.  You can also mark an X for 2nd focus target after skull goes down. If you need you can mark stuff for CC like square for trap, circle for sap, or whatever your group decides each mark means. Later you can power shift to open a pull with a charge when you have instant rage, or enrage first to get rage, but watch out for the armor debuff, you'll get hit harder.
---
Except ya know many zones have a 10 level spread and people sometimes come back to clean up the quests they missed due to a dungeon or something and want the same quest boss spawn on a 10min respawn rate...
---
It might be unbalanced pvp but it‚Äôs not always about being an asshole.
---
Fair enough. 
---
However, there was a post here earlier of a mage winning Ironfoe from a warrior, rogue, and a shaman. 
---
The consensus there was that it was a dick move, but would you be ok with that if he only had a gold to his name? Who knows, he may have been able to disenchant it and sell the mats for the gold.
---
If that's not ok, then fine, it's for BoEs only. But there are plenty of BiS items that are BoE, and I don't think it is stupid to be upset at some caster winning Edgemaster's Handguards from a fury warrior.
---
Now imagine no central base camp and no flight paths. That's what alliance get. Gromgol is a huge advantage.
---
I find that Rogue/Warrior DPS skyrockets in lategame raids because the equipment they get is so much better and scales more compared to spells. You may get an amazing staff upgrade on your mage/priest/warlock, which will only add like 20-30 spell damage, some stats and a bit of crit... But a warrior going from a blue 2H to an epic Rag drop will see their DPS skyrocket. 
---
You'll find that for now the DPS is mostly an even competition (with rogues/warriors generally winning out in long term fights but mages/locks winning out in AoE/short fights), but when warriors get equipment like Ashkandi or Hand of Rag, you'll find that it's very hard to keep up with them.
---
If you joined this group, it would be master looted. So no chance in spoiling the res.
---
Just keep saving. Tailoring should be very cheap to level so it's not an issue. Idk about enchanting, it should eat into your income with all the disenchanting but since you got mount at 42 you seem to be doing fine.
---
Make yourself some shadoweave and dreamweave stuff as you hit the required levels, it doesn't cost much and will carry you all the way to 60 (I skipped boots because there are comparable ones from some quest).

Are orcs based on klingons from star trek at all? Or take traits from them?

Especially from deep space 9. The hair lines/styles, behaviour, personalities, sayings, etc
---
&gt;acting like it's real pvp
---
Nobody is though. Thats the thing. Nobody ganking acts like it's "real" pvp. We do it because it's fun and 90% of the time starys real conflicts
---
Literally *every* wpvp event has spawned from ganking.
---
Ganking IS vanilla.
---
berserk? escape?
---
I rerolled warlock after I got my whirlwind axe. I never want to see those trolls again. 
---
I have absolutely no shame about ganking now. They made me a monster after getting fucked on warrior.
---
Jesus Christ that's alot of information it feels like lol. 
---
 Well I got the add-ons I was downloading them off cursed forge untill someone told me about the twitch app. Then i read somewhere always target the tanks target and asked and turned on target of target. Other than that I know nothing else what you've mentioned. I swear without my healer add-on it'd be dam near impossible to heal effectively.
---
We do loot council (also an officer in my guild) and essentially there is 7 council members. That consists of the GM, Officers and Role Leaders for the raid.
---
When we begin loot council an interface is shown to the players and they indicate their interest in the item. Need, Minor Upgrade, Greed or Pass. They can also write a little note indicating why they want the item. Most of our players use this to indicate if they will receive a set bonus or if the item is best in slot for their class and spec.
---
We as council members then discuss the loot (often quickly as most drops for example from Molton Core are happening mid-raid). We first prioritise people who haven't had loot recently.
---
Out of those people we'll inspect their gear (the council software can show us what they have in the interface) so we can see if it is a substantial upgrade for them or if they've done a lot of work getting their pre-raid BIS gear and so deserve to be rewarded for that effort over the other players who perhaps didn't do that work (although such an individual would get an item eventually as again we prioritise everyone getting something most of all).
---
There are exceptions of course. If you fail to turn up to a raid and don't tell anyone you are less likely to get an item the next time. If you have a poor attitude, rage quit, are significantly late and hold up the rest of the raid while we wait for you, if you only login on raid days and aren't really contributing to the guild or your character beyond what you get from the raid etc
---
Loot council isn't perfect. Sometimes two players or in one case 5 players all had the same worthiness to receive a piece of loot. In these situations we can use rc loot's built in roll system to choose one of those people at random. We have used this a number of times and we always use it for loot such as the 18 slot Onyxia bags which everyone wants.
---
Occasions where players have exactly the same weighting (in council members minds) are rare but ultimately there is 7 votes and if it comes down to it we can do a tie break situation or change our re-vote if there's not a clear winner, alternative to that rolling.
---
For our guild it is working out quite well, we've been raiding for a few weeks, we've not had any raiders leave, some raiders expressed criticism over a mistake we made one time but we've since fixed that and they were satisfied with our resolution.
---
To make the council more open we talk with the entire raid live via Discord voice chat and we will say, okay x do you mind not getting this item so y can get a set bonus but next item that drops in this series you will get? and stuff like that.
---
It requires trust, but we've not prioritised loot council members, friends, officers or any such thing. In-fact this has been several weeks of raiding now and one of our council members received their first piece of loot (an Epic T1 piece) only this week and our Raid Leader so far has 2 items out of the 60+ that have dropped etc
---
I think other methods such as Rolling can work too though our concern with not going with such a system is the chance that the same people keep getting loot or some people never ever get loot etc you're always going to have some outliers at either end of that spectrum at-least with loot council we can view a history and make sure everyone is progressing and no one feels like they're wasting their time.
---
But again it needs trust and honesty. Being inside the system, voting and such.. I can see how it can be abused very easily to funnel items to friends, trading votes amongst each other and such, it needs transparency.
---
It's a separate addon that adds maps to atlasloot. Looks like this if you get it:
---
https://i.imgur.com/Ns81Nnt.png
---
You can also get regular Atlas, which has more info on the maps (not just bosses) and maps for dungeon entrances, but it's not as convenient as having everything in one place.
---
And then that person made the entire group reroll, but disregarded the rolls of both myself and the other enchanter. How is that more fair than rolling need on an item from the get go?
---
I mean... that and being in a group of 4+ people on one is the only way alliance can do the winning.
---
Lol you fell for the trap.
---
F's in chat

Good at what?  Speed leveling?   Having multiple people play your account?  Having a laundry list of cultist to give you shit?

Good thing I rolled warrior :P
---
I mean in dungeons i dont expect anyone to ask, theres no point cuz im giving them water anyways but if im questing and someone opens trade f off
---
This really dumb quest that punishes people who are trying to play cooperatively and help.
---
Way too far behind tbh, most are 60 now and quitting as we speak. Servers will be dead within a month - all content already cleared. 
---
In all seriousness, the game has been out a month and a half. I dont understand what you are thinking? Like the game is dead soon?
---
I 100% agree. You play however you want to play. I was just poking fun at the terminology this meme used the exaggerate the point that combat isn't viable in PvP and assumes people think sub is a meme spec even though no one thinks that
---
This video goes over everything you want in there: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPqYbrXKrTs

Bit of a newbie but do you have a guide or is there a way I can just download your ui and addons? I‚Äôm a mage also and love your layout.
---
Why would you ever roll on a BoP item that you can‚Äôt use without the intention of being a dick or an idiot? 
---
Who in their right mind thinks a vendor price is more important than someone else‚Äôs upgrade. 
---
I‚Äôm talking sellables. You can buy edgemasters, you can buy an enchanting recipe. You can‚Äôt buy Ironfoe.
---
DKP fails with cross-class and cross-role items. Even without collusion (which is a problem even with minimum bids) you are going to have issues of certain classes with larger dkp amounts able to get all of the choice cross class items (rings/trinkets/etc.). Classic has a lot of cross class BIS items. It also doesn‚Äôt ensure that your raid is getting the most benefit from items in terms of stacking items on your tanks.  You need some sort of modified or reserve system to maximize the gains for your raid.
---
Yeah, there are a lot of dubious default settings in WoW and this is mostly stuff the friends who got me into WoW the second time for Burning Crusade walked me through.
---
Depends if you're REALLY serious about pvp. If I was planning on doing serious pvp and rolling with a premade i would.
---
Cast Regrowth/Rejuvenation on yourself before you pull. This makes it way harder for aggro to be taken away by neanderthal dps players, makes the healers mana pool last longer, and you should have a bunch of free mana anyway.
---

Theres no such thing as an "all horde" layer... You just feel that way because your realm is overwhelmingly Horde based.
---
Easy for a warrior to say lol
---
Does anyone not have this mindset?  My IRL rage bar fills faster than my warriors.  The only thing keeping me going is the dim notion that once I become geared at level 60 the great reckoning will come.
---
great example of a very low iq weirdo.  only surprised it took so long for you to show up.
---
Eh I'm in a guild as the enhancement shaman, already cleared mc and ony a few times so it's going well so far
---
I mean that‚Äôs just dumb. I‚Äôm not saying this guy is not a dick. But he did not ninja a BoE enchanting recipe.
---
phew, dodged that server just barely due to guilds want to do pve.
---
I mean it all makes perfect sense.
---
You are just unable to execute it. That not my fault.
---
Undead rogues are the absolute worst. Bunch of fuckin war criminals.
---
I tried the same thing with getting my wife to return and play.  After 3 days she was simply upset that she was playing as another way of spending time with me, but I wasnt playing along with her.  Lesson learned.. let this be a cautionary tale.
---
that is world pvp lmao
---
20 points is not non-Resto, it‚Äôs just not full Resto. It‚Äôs roughly 85% as good. And BWL is easy, tons of guilds will clear it without everyone try-hard min-maxing. Get out of here with the dumbass nonsense.
---
Your right, tons of guilds will clear it without min maxing. But not guilds with  enhancement shamans as healers lmao
---
Just say at the beginning you are new, most people won't be mad. If it's a raid do your research first and read a guide on the raid before hand so you have a basic grasp on the strats and anything people mention you don't know just ask.
---
You have to learn somewhere, I played vanilla but i'm even seeing some skip runs and the like mentioning things i don't recognize or have forgotten.
---
Transferred...as in started fresh on another server, or did they actually enable character transfers? Because I gotta get off my server but I'm not starting from scratch again.

The way I see it, regardless of your level, I'll kill you if it means not going too far out of my way. But I'll only give you one. I'm not gonna camp anyone. Unless you broke a truce. Then I'll camp you.. or at least try.
---
Except he waited till exactly that moment to act.  He waited until he had what he wanted, then he said "Okay, now I'm ready to do this".  That's why he sucks too.  I mean, look at what Hamish himself posted.  Dude had priority on 14 different items.  Its not like he wasn't getting shit out of this deal.  He just had his fill, so he called it quits.
---
I wish my realm Mankrik was dead during work hours, 24/7 thier is too much competition for devilsaur

Make sure it's elvui classic not the normal elvui
---
Ne is objectively the worst rogue race for PvP.
---
Uhhh if you're not ganking every low level rogue you see you're not doing it right.  You need to make them hate themselves and roll a different class.
---
Put the restoration shaman in the group of people that need mana,  not the one who can't spend it because they have to watch threat.
---
The triple dot is the only thing that I can't let go. It may look like a trivial thing if you don't know what I'm talking about, but you can get them only if you have a Chinese or Japanese input installed on a PC while typing this.
---
So either Brack, or someone who wrote this for him had such input method installed. Could be a Blizzard PR writer (secretary?) who also managed communication with China, idunno. Could be that Brack actually can speak Chinese and has Chinese language support installed on his mahicne, Idunno. You decide what's more probable.
---
He should be auto blacklisted for that shit

You don't NEED gold, you want gold. Needing is for items that can directly benefit you. If nobody can directly benefit then everyone needs. That's like a hunter taking tank gear because they need gold.

At least the priest one is well out of the way so the only people that can find you are ones that know the deal.

Nah bro, I'm 30 something mad that my wife didn't buy the right cookies.

This guy knows how to WoW.

We did consider DKP too but we all had too much of a bad experience with it. Ultimately we asked the entire raid what system they wanted with discussions and polls in the weeks leading to us reaching a full raid roster and it was like 38/40 for Loot Council and 2 for just random rolls.
---
Even the guy who said DKP let him get everything he ever wanted when he raided in retail originally over 10 years ago said he didn't want the system because it's too easily used to infuriate other raiders.
---
The main criticism of the system from our discussions was like this, imagine you only spend your DKP every few weeks as items drop but there's one guy who saves his up forever and then suddenly he spends it on every item he wants for weeks and weeks.
---
Although that in number terms is completely balanced and fair, you all had the same DKP and same chance to get stuff and so forth. The reality is, human beings don't like to play the same raids for 6 weeks straight and get diddly-squat.
---
When you're trying to corale 40 people twice (or even more often once more content is available) every week it's difficult to make them show up if they know for weeks upon weeks they won't get anything at all. They after-all are playing to be entertained and steady rewards are important, the loot council can guarantee that.
---
Another situation one of them brought up was getting burnt out before they had enough DKP to get something and although they had a lot built up it always seemed another player had more and wanted the item they were after. Discouraging.
---
who cares?
---
I have no idea why people join loot council guilds. ZDKP is the only system that makes sense, and there are literally discord bots that take care of everything these days.
---
How is it a total waste, do you think the heals would be too weak or something? Cuz they're not
---
The whole game is full of smooth brains
---
Could've been unaware of its purpose.  Awbee is easy to miss, especially since hardly any groups clear the trash around her, and then you have to talk to her for the quest marker to show up.
---
famously bugged quest. took me 3 tries in 2006.
---
Oh you mean like any other server?
---
It was one of the first ones added after the initial EU ones went live. I think I know for a fact it wasnt a starter realm and was defo added but can't exactly remember when.
---
I need gold to buy my BoE that will directly benefit me. The other player needs that item, but he can also buy that item with gold. We NEED gold.
---
He literally said why in the post you responded to, are you really this thick?
---
I'm not saying I'm not bias. I know my ultra specific views are not the generally accepted way to play. But when your guild implodes when AQ launches and all your high performing players drop all their dkp and dip out with some fresh loot and join a guild like mine you know why.
---
You cant, Warlocks are the king of pvp.
---
If you want to do dungeons as BM this should be fine however, you need a better pet. 
---
Any Cat will do fine, ensure you have max level bite and/or claw so the DPS is good and ensure you are using bestial wrath on cool down - ensure you want for a Frenzy Proc (it‚Äôll show on your pet buff list) before using to maximise your damage.
---
You‚Äôll also want to ensure you are no clipping your auto-shot too often (or at all) depending on your weapon speed.
---
As for raiding, the 2/31/18 is worthwhile to get while your hit is low (less than 6%). Raiding as BM is very hard as your damage comes from your pet who dies easily without good management in raids.
---
Or hillsbrad or Desolace or anywhere
---
Ok but seriously War Mode was a good attempt at dealing with the faction imbalance on servers.  Servers had become completely one sided for years.  They should have just made any pvp server character you had warmode enabled.  Being able to disable it just caused the same issue servers had, but with an entire faction.
---
Great reply. The video is shit and boring but if they get good at making vids id watch more of em.
---
Pretty sure he's referring to your 50 question marks about a tank rolling on it.
---
[It aint me playing in the distance]
---
Orc Rogue really shines as well. Basically the Dwarf Rogue of Horde.
---
For when you want to kill the other rogues.
---
honestly just kiting him is just as easy and wont require buffs/enchants/pots other than mana pots, which would be of use no matter if you kite or melee him
---
Looks like Chiren (his real name) really became the Athene
---
Then why play in a pvp world?
---
Is geddon bomb still a thing :( please let it be

No you're greedy so you want gold, I've gotten by just fine without needing to steal items and sell them on the AH

First issue is that he is using a MAC.

Rogues, Warriors and Feral Druids. Don't know if there's anything in PvE.
---
Can you learn the higher hemo ranks from a class trainer?
---
If you're in a guild group for BRD, warriors get Ironfoe prio, no question. PvP is another matter. Good luck to the rogue finding a tank for Ironfoe farm.
---
51 and a half
---
Tailoring is like 150g gold minimum to level assuming you get good/ decent deals on stuff in the AH... not exactly cheap for a lvl 42

You'd get some of that back if you sell mats but if he's leveling enchanting also he won't...

There's a nifty feature on account management area of the wow website where you can restore any item that was deleted through vendor or otherwise. If I recall correctly you can only use it once every 15 days. Works with classic.

Nope. Leave it as it is.

For raids. You're going to want to read up on the raid encounters and loot tables. Everyone watches a video on how to do ONY before the raid. Most guilds require a couple addons for boss mechanics. There's usually that one guy who doesn't realize that he's been turned into a bomb and wipes the raid.
---
Though Pug raids tend to always explain what everyone should be doing before each fight.
---
It‚Äôs not stealing. It‚Äôs needing on a BoE item.
---
How'd you do it?
---
Yeah, you still haven't made a case for why it would implode under a dkp system.
---
If your guild, as hardcore as it is, decides to run dkp with limited prio, would you fail to clear Naxx eventually? Why would your guild implode or fail under such a system?
---
Every voice matters...
---
You think it does but it doesn‚Äôt.
---
&gt; I have to use it.
---
No, you don't. You can't complain about an addon giving an unfair advantage while you, yourself, are using it.
---
I believe that meme originated on private servers where when the trendy server would be packed and the rest be considered dead. 
---
The "no changes" crowd never complainrd when they found out classic realms have higher capacity then original ones
---
You realize that addons like Spy have existed all the way back to Vanilla, right? This isn't a pirate server thing.
---
49 and a half. Only really able to play on the weekends and a couple hours during the week
---
Raid every night? My guild  clears mc and ony in like 3 hrs lmao
---
It's small, but it's there. It'll help you enough that you can feel its effect, that is, if you pvp a lot.
---
But also, if you like a race more than another (voice, models, animations, how gear looks on it ...), you'll enjoy playing it possibly so much more that the racial advantage isn't worth it in comparison.
---
So play what you want to play, and my advice would be not to reroll. It's not worth risking burning out and quitting.
---
Video game rules dont apply to real life though. Thats why you can go on a killing spree in a game, die, and live. You think you can do that in real life?
---
That guy certainly was. That's my point. It was overwhelmingly pretentious.
---
Now it‚Äôs time to gquit
---
It's just reading the chat log, you can't really stop an addon from doing that.
---
There are sensitive Nancy‚Äôs on both sides, trash talk horde or Ali in a public forum and its ‚Äúoh your so immature that stuff doesn‚Äôt Even matter waa waa waa PvP is for losers blah blah blah‚Äù

Alexsensual will never let that down. Greatest moment to experience live.
---
Its usually horde that do this...
---
If your a mage, maybe not.
---
Ooooh thanks
---
I generally keep the let bigons be bigons mentality and it‚Äôs flawless except for rogues and feral druids. If I ever see one around me I make it a point to track them. If they cloak I immediately start spamming rank 1 consecration and I will continue casting it until 
---
1. The Lil shit gets hit by it and meets his maker
---
2. He/she decloaks and starts attacking another mob 
---
3. Decloaks and Starts taunting me
---
Most of the time it‚Äôs 
---
2. And to ruin their opener is pretty much a win for me every time unless the rogue blinds me and runs away in which case I usually just go back to casting consecration.
---
Sorry, wasn‚Äôt meant as a complaint.
---
Ooooooh thanks I was wondering
---
Especially the same class.
---
Death run still fastah
---
I always kill low levels, as when I was a low level I was killed.
---
&gt; In most cases, that guildie that put that player on the blacklist is more likely to be the player you don't want to group with.
---
Yep! I went to kill the chieftain in winterspring and asked in general if anybody wanted him. Mage rides up, I invite him but he‚Äôs in a group. I ask for an invite and get no response. He stands up from drinking and starts to cast so I immediately run in and grab the quest mob and set about killing it... it took me 1 cool down (evasion).
---
Mage called me rude, I pointed out I tried to include him and his excuse was ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in a full group‚Äù... yeah man that makes it ok to steal the mob and make me wait on a respawn, just drop group for 30 seconds. Next he told me I was a trash scrub who couldn‚Äôt have killed it solo anyway... sure mate I have all my cool downs up and the GM arena trinket. I‚Äôd have been fine. 
---
After that he told me I was blacklisted with his guild and ‚Äúa number of others‚Äù. Bit more and some comments about how ‚Äúhis rep‚Äù would stop me from ever raiding and such.
---
I mean good luck, did MC last night after being recruited by the guild who got the server first MC and Ony kills... so I guess his blacklist didn‚Äôt work so well. Sure as hell won‚Äôt be recommending we bring him to any runs though.
---
Yikes. ;s
---
Yeah I def hear you with the arena meta statement, just kinda feeling down because I feel like I chose the wrong race rip, hopefully won‚Äôt matter that much but I love reading these comments, learning a lot for sure
---
&gt; 2. inconvenience me enough
---
I was just being me, a regular old cow, minding my own business and fishing near Steamwheedle port in Tanaris. I wasn‚Äôt ganking, I wasn‚Äôt questing, just fishing. Some ally mage around 5-7 levels lower than I was decided it would be funny to constantly swim around my fishing bobber to try to fuck up me looting the fish. I‚Äôm pretty sure he still found it funny running back from the GY. I know I would.
---
What‚Äôs the point of this post? Collective stereotyping and circlejerk?
---
awesome screenshot

Ding ding ding. Retired Raider. This way, everyone wins.

Are invisibility pots / cloak usable in combat? Would that be a viable way to do the MC strat?
---
Actually .... being handed by Horde is on any day ending in a "y".

In 2006 someone rolled need on valor shoulder pads by accident and I opened a ticket and they sent me the shoulders in the mail it was magical .
---
I fall off a flight path into the middle of nowhere about once a week and even though it's definitely a network issue somewhere along the line, restarting the game fixes it.
---
I always feel pity for players that play overpopulated faction and abuse their power. Like they are too dumb to understand that what they are doing is hurting THEMselves the most - each pointless kill prehonor era means there is a chance you make some future cannon fodder quit this realm or transfer away from it seeing how shitty it is.   
---
It's just like some veterans in early access games - game is fully released, tons of newbies joining, community of veterans is extremaly toxic, newbies start leaving, next month game is dead and veterans whine about it.   
---
Whenever I am on the overpopulated side I try to respect enemy faction as much as possible(for instance as a priest while waiting at BRD instance portal I try to mindcontrol people so they can actually enter the instance, as at any time of the day there are retards sitting there and just killing people trying to make their way into the instance) and I make it solely for selfish reasons - I want them to keep playing, I want them to stay as I will need them later in the game for proper pvp interactions.

I crafted almost exclusively white items and bags to 300. Back then bags sold pretty well, though sometimes for a bit less than it cost to craft them, but that's still pretty much free skill points. Nothing to disenchant, either.
---
Dunno how it would work out now that smaller bags are in less demand, but cloth is still dirt cheap most of the way so I don't see how it would add to 150g. You don't have to rush it to 300 either, just 250 is enough for mooncloth pattern and you get dreamweave stuff at the same level.
---
&gt; Now the scammers will need to rebuild the guild from scratch

It's genuinly fun to play RP a character that has faction pride in a social game with world PvP. Like I have no actual ill will towards Alliance players but since I am playing a character that is at war with the Alliance I do things that would go with that like kill Alliance too close to town.
---
AtlasLootClassic_Maps I think. Just type in atlas or atlasloot in twitch client and there aren't many options to choose from.
---
Just another day on WoW. I love this game.
---
Fire is very good but current raids resist it so everyone is frost. You will see a lot of fire in later phases. Arcane tree just supports the other schools, using primarily arcane skills isn't really a thing.
---
I just tanked it at level 37 with no issues.
---
I spent a good 2-3 hours stun locking a hunter working on his. Wait patiently till he gets to that one point in the fight where he got a bit too greedy but managed to clutch it out and you can almost visibility see his character sigh in relief as he's settled... Cheap shot, blind, wait till demon gets close, kidney and watch death. Then casually stealth back into the ether knowing I've made rogues everywhere just a little safer and a little more proud.
---
60 warrior full pre raid bis geared. And a 45 mage. I don‚Äôt get to play during the week either.

I mean fwiw I have played on pvp servers my entire life and been hard camped like, 2-3 times total. It's usually verrrry rare to piss off someone enough that they wait out your death run just to kill you again.

That seems quite annoying, you might have picked the wrong server with a lot of alliance majority. I wasn‚Äôt specially looking for it but luckily I got on a server with 55/45 in horde favour (maybe 60/40 not sure how accurate the analytics are). 
---
So where ever you go you will always find people fighting on either side. And most people are good sport about it. But there is always those who complain and they seem to have the loudest voice out of all. And these voices are ally voices most of the time (on my server), but maybe I just don‚Äôt hear the horde.
---
No, you‚Äôre right. I forgot to take the crit from the Agi into account
---
Out of curiosity, what would it say in his combat log?
---
That‚Äôs kinda weird tbh. When I think of a mage I think of arcane type shit.
---
*crickets chirping sfx*
---
They can ban you for that if you're avoiding guards.
---
Many are called, few are chosen
---
Lvl60 with a fulltime job and no real life obligations (i cant adult properly wow is life)
---
Hm I use index finger for S
---
Yeah pretty much. Wanna 1v1 me scrub?
---
I died shortly after, but it was worth it!
---
and also with you.
---
I haven't pvped since EQ, but it's hilarious how its the same old shit.
---
The gankers and gankees.  The evil side (Dark Team/Horde) are the gankers and the good side (Light Side/Alliance) are the good guys who just wanna play the game without being ganked by nasty old evils.
---
lol
---
If you were faster it would be your node.
---
With dodge chance, harder to detect, and that tiny poison resistance how are they worse than humans?
---
Look at how much maul adds in damage compared to swipe. Swipe costs 15, while maul costs 10 + what a white hit would've generated (5-10 depending on crit). Based on that and the amount of targets, you can decide which is more worth.
---
For some more advice, hot yourself before pulls, and if your health is high or your healer close to full mana, stay in bear and use berserk in between pulls to get some extra rage. If you have a lot of mobs, spam your shout (it deals a bit of threat).
---
I wonder if they enjoyed the process. I don't enjoy anything anymore and I don't know what to do.
---
It is world PvP. Call in a buddy and give him the same treatment
---
That‚Äôs not true. But I‚Äôm also giving him a real reason, I have seen many people talking about exactly what I said and why certain undead are KoS in city general chats
---
Is that a horde on barons mount leading the charge? That's hilarious, he's not stop supposed to be there!
---
Learn to blink slow boi
---
Oh ok. This is my first time playing. I just started because some friends said it‚Äôs fun.  So far it‚Äôs been a grind.
---
It's an okay race. Improved stealth and a few extra innate points of Agility (highest in the game) isn't a bad choice at all.
---
Can confirm , someone killed me while I was leveling in Tanaris when i was doing the Tooga Esort quest right  near the end 
---
You better believe i made 3 alliance suffer the same fate!
---
for the horde mother fuckers
---
Considering the amount of undead or orc toons made people think its a big deal perosanly feel escape artist shits on all 1min cd is broken but as a gnome im not complaining
---
I don‚Äôt usually talk like that, but I think any insult can have a funny enough context to not get offended by it.
---
&gt;Someone needs to ~~jerk off~~
---
Get laid.
---
This isn't a bad idea.
---
Also guild name checks out
---
Wait for MoP re-release when they make a 20-24 bracket, I think it's pretty decent in there too :D

Wahhhh whining

For mine for 400g back in The day
---
The Whirlwind Axe is better, although it's going to require help if you're low 30's. I used it 'till almost mid 50's. There are always some exceptions and some gear is just really nice. The question is would you PUG farm SM until it drops, because that's what advertizing reserved loot usually means.
---
Lol only horde does that
---
World PvP is a give and take. Sometimes you are on the receiving end of a beat down and other times you are the one dishing it. It‚Äôs all part of the dynamic of the game. Most people I think enjoy it but it‚Äôs not for everyone. They thought of this when they created the PvE servers.
---
I play mostly in the morning so I don‚Äôt have issues getting on without a queue. It‚Äôs nice because the AH is flooded with items that are usually more rare which drives the price down. Makes it suck to try to sell though. Fairly easy to find groups. I mostly did it because of past experience on private servers. When a server population plummets for one reason or another it makes playing very boring. I figured faerlina would be immune to any max exodus that happens when the novelty of classic wears off.
---
Who main specs healing through lower lvling? It‚Äôs almost all off spec healers till 50+
---
If alliance you can get the DM book next tues which is better also.
---
"You didn't this one PvP server so you should never play any PvP server" K buddy, you're right I'm a baby and I'm gonna go roll up a gnome warlock on Westfall. Any other sage advice oh great oracle?

Orcs are based on Warhammer. Back in the day Silicon &amp; Synapse (later renamed Blizzard) wanted to make an RTS game based on Warhammer universe, but they couldn't get a license so they just replaced names and lore and made their own franchise.
---
T1 stuff is pretty irrelevant. Before long most just get DE'd. I'm talking BWL and AQ40 stuff
---
But arms warriors can tank 5 mans no problem and then do DPs in raid.
---
Correction. As a whole they may not be skilled, but they house some of the best if not the best pserver EU players who you can tell are pretty godlike when watching their vods.
---
purple ones are melee, green are range. los them behind a wall. however some walls in strat UD are fake and wont los. enemies can walk right through those. so just about knowing which walls are los-able
---
In Itemrack addon, is it possible to keybind an armor slot (head, boots, offhand) to a specific keybind? I know this was possible in the Vanilla Itemrack. I'm not seeing the option in Itemrack 3.19 to do this.
---
After seeing how many upvotes this has I can safely say that 90% reddit is horde lol
---
I don't share quest/grind spots with horde.
---
I thought this was gonna be someone afk autorunning into one of the roaming elite giants and getting pummeled to death with the quickness
---
Definitely did not happen to me
---
Yes, when I was playing tonight about 7 level 60 allies in raid gear showed up to attack hillsbrad fields. They slaughtered lowbies for a while and then a bunch of level 40s and a few lvl high lvl 50 horde guys banded together to protect the levelers. The battle swung from the fields to south shore to the yeti cave and ended at TM when more reinforcements from under city arrived. 
---
Did it put a wrench in grinding levels for some people? Sure. But it was a big fun spontaneous battle and it's something you cant really get in other games.
---
I mean like 45-55 range is full of real healers. Plus healers can just sit at dungeon entrances and spam run dungeons to level instead of playing the game (that‚Äôs how the priest in my guild got to 60).
---
Mats and bindings is how the guild pays for those runs. The guild I pug with for example spends a ton of money on things like repair bots and tank potions.
---
Sounds like you got tilted af.
---
I'm PrEtTy sUrE iT's OnLy tHe HoRdE bRO
---
i don't think it always has to do with maturity. if that's the way you wanna play and that's how you have fun then do you, that's why there's both pve and pvp servers
---
I can completely understand. I started off as a warrior tank as a first time player. Went into deadmines and said in pt chat multiple times im a new player, no idea what im doing please give me tips and advice on how to do my job better. Between being called "completely retarded" and  in another party "a waste of air" i just deleted the warrior and went hunter (as well as changed servers because). Wasnt impressed with the community at first but it has gotten better as have i... hopefully... atleast a little?

---
Which EU server to pick for the most competitive pvp ( both world and BG ) and pve ( gearing issues ), i suspect golemagg. Also, how much is the ping difference between germany and GB based servers ?  Are germany based servers mostly hosting germans ( so majority speaking german ) or is it "normal" mish-mash of whatever works atm
---
Chars on high pop servers have 1 free realm transfer to a lower pop server
---
This happens, what do you expect them to do? Yeah it's a big inconvenience potentially but the run didn't start so it is within norm.
---
If the flight has multiple legs you can stop the flight at the nearest flight master, if it helps.
---
And of the few chosen, even fewer remain.
---
No, world PVP is the chads way of saying ‚Äúganking‚Äù. You will never start a fight you know you will lose. 
---
Also telling your guildies you corpse camped someone 30 levels below you doesn‚Äôt sound very good. So instead of put a spin on it and say ‚Äúyeah I did some world PVP in lakeshire today‚Äù 
---
World PVP doesn‚Äôt exist, it‚Äôs just ganking, stop kidding your self.
---
Agreed, as long as they are up front about it all.
---
Nah, just an undead epic mount, baron's mount is blue, that one is purple.
---
I doubt you could name me very many 45-50 main spec healers. Except those doing exactly what you‚Äôre saying, dungeon grinding. Any OS healer can suffice up to near max lvl but if you make it MS you effectively lose your ability to quest.
---
lmao
---
Undead rogue ganking, downvoted. Alliance ganking, 90% upvote hmmmmm
---
I wish my server was like this. 
---
Instead I (Alliance level 40 warlock) get ganked by a Horde level 60 warlock in STV. He literally targeted me for over an hour, maybe two, even let other Alliance characters live while focusing on me. I eventually escaped him, but that was a solid hour or two of being able to do nothing. :( I'm not even sure what I did...
---
Smoke signals.
---
That's like reaching out really quickly to pet a dog that's used to being beaten. You should at least emote at them first lol
---
There are multiple resto shaman. No point having an elemental shaman at all, they go oom insanely fast and have fewer buffs than a resto.
---
No, it's definitely right, working as intended, has always been this way
---
By the time I left it was about 3:7ish.
---
in most dungeons, pats are a thing. and some mobs cast things like fear, which if not careful, will send you into other groups of mobs.
---
Losing also allows the tank to get more threat as they run up to him one at a time. lets a little rage build up collects all the mobs into one pile. vs chwrging to them and havung them still too spread out for aoe, as the casters wont move and just stand still. 
---
most tanks will move back into los early, because the dps or healer decided to hit a mob before the los is complete. and since the dps and healer will usually jist sit there getting damage, rather than losing the mob they aggrod, the tank then has to leave los to pick up the mob the impatient player was hitting.
---
King's honor, friend
---
If you aren't going for rank 14 then don't bother, just pick what you like aesthetically/fantasy wise
---
tldr: kid is triggered because his badness was pointed out
---
Does this mean you can right click on a stealth rogue, even if you can't see them if you click the correct spot you'll target and attack?  Is this a range thing?
---
It's pretty much how I play half the time for solo leveling
---
Second wind is about as rare as HoJ I think.
---
Not seen a single apes video showing skill just an overwhelming amount of engineers.
---
Yeah blizzard wont do anything unless u make a huge issue out of it and the other player has 2 agree and make a ticket saying they agree that they want 2 give the item 2 you. Even then they still probably wont do it since new GMs are has nice has old GMs :(
---
Yikes dawg just went back, crunched the numbers. There were THREE fights where there were even 5 warlocks in the top 50. One of which was the four horsemen - which they can dot all bosses in. The other being gothik in which they can dot multiple mobs at the same time. It looks like information speaks for itself - And you just refuse to admit that warlock is not S+, S- A+ A- and at best is B+ come end game. Interesting.
---
It's easy. For the majority of the duels it's still a 50/50 chance even if the rogue gets the opener(in a bo3 without thistle that is), if the rogue doesn't the opener he might aswell /ff.  
---
That's it, that's why it's frowned upon not to. Running around spamming aoe is just putting too much emphasis on the opener.  
---
(And laughing at the hunters crying over flare trapping, you guys were always the laughing stock of orgrimmar duels, if you're struggling with rogues as a hunter just uninstall the game)
---
Not helping, hes trying to get into her booty.
---
Bullseyecon Blameaux can suck a big fat dick for this.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs true I‚Äôve only seen it drop a handful of times
---
Ignorant
---
I once joined an MC pug that reserved crafting mats and bindings.... the issue I had was there was like, 2 people from said guild.
---
My guild died over the hearthstone grandmasters controversy so I'm basically all alone on Herod.
---
I hate Asmongold and queue times so I'm thinking of taking the free character migration.
---
My options are 
---
* Arcanite Reaper
---
* Earthfury
---
* Loatheb
---
* Sul' Thraze
---
Anyone know which of these servers is not trash? Horde btw
---
Z-pearl, bartender, sexy maps
---
Probably snutz or another lock
---
Except rogue
---
Wait are you implying that stv isn't a horde quest zone as well?
---
That is a good candidate but not every guild leader plays a caster.....   And most guilds capable of clearing naxx have a team of 5-10 people who are very active , could be any of them.
---
I did the same, at Lv32 I turned in my quest and it rewarded 100 reputation.  I currently have 99/21000 into Revered.  Based on everything I understand about how reputation penalties work, I should have gotten full rep.  A guild member turned in at Lv37 and also got 100 rep.
---
The reason I asked is everywhere else I always read it's 250 rep, and I should be 249/21000.  I submitted a ticket it to see if the value for that quest is actually correct.  So, I wanted to know if you have more than 99 rep.
---
hmm well that's exactly what they did to me, had 6 people in their guild sitting in mc when I had a raid ready to go in.
---
With current ticket wait times there's no chance in hell we'd be able to get someone to kick them out, guess I'll just do it to them when they plan to raid today.
---
It is true, thinking that the in-game factions and races have a bearing on how a person acts is crazy.  Its pure confirmation bias.  
---
Sharing your experience certainly doesn‚Äôt prove confirmation bias isn‚Äôt EXTREMELY common with people in general.
---
Yes, it is.
---
But you need the proper farming areas.
---
You could probably aoe farm sm:gy and library right now
---
You can see in his screenshots, he's actively fighting back against the other GM's justifications for just about everything. You can see him call them out for stacking raid A with their top DPSers (with screenshots of chat logs and combat logs), call them out for trying to convince their entire mage playerbase that mageblade isn't their bis (with chat logs and voice com recordings), call them out on their entire loot prio system (with screenshots of their spreadsheets for evidence). He provides substantial evidence for his claims, as well as evidence that he pushed back on a large amount of it.
---
Yea i prefer to see people saying something is reserved, then whispering some guy and getting no answer or do you need that item? And if i do sya...
---
whats this have to do with maturity?  its playing the game as intended. warring factions are expected to fight each other
---
That's sadly just not true. Fire mages scale to oblivion in Naxx gear, their spells scale better and their talents amplify their damage even more - i.e. they get 6% hit which means they can lose that hit on gear and go crit/damage instead, amplifying their Ignites further. They also get threat reduction, while warlocks are just sitting there threat capped.
---
That all changes in TBC however, where warlocks get the extra shadow damage from gear talent and Soulshatter, tying rogues for first place in damage.
---
That is possible if you switch to raid frames.
---
Yeah, I saw this posted 3 weeks ago, just didn't think it was that frequent. This is my first playthrough and so far this is the coolest place, and easily my best screenshot.
---
He resisted the first trap, and at least one serpent sting (just as he's entering Thelsamar.. maybe more, since rogue only got poisoned once).
---
It's a matter of how much time someone spends in a city. Think of the mats and time a enchanter spends in the city as debt he holds on the books. When he makes a sale he removes some debt and accrues wealth.  But he can only do this in one city at a time. With vellum, that same enchanter can put a few enchant on every ah. Then go out farm or run dungeons while waiting for his enchants to sale. Vastly increasing his profit margin.
---
As of now the enchanter has to maintain a presence in the city (only one) and hope it has people who need his enchants right then. 
---
In retail I can buy an enchant and hold on to it until I get that upgrade I want. The enchanter doesnt have to fish for me. Under current rules, I'm playing the game. Accruing wealth and having fun. While he's stuck in org spamming +7 stam enchant.
---
Are you undead? Undead rogues have a super bad rep among alliance players so people will kill you ‚Äúto make up for everyone you‚Äôll kill in the future‚Äù lol
---
Its the only other trinket with AP in game, but with Diremaulbits not the case anymore
---
They really are the new huntard
---
Throw a grenade
---
Learned that when we couldn't find a tank and had 2 hunters and 1 warlock with me.... got really old manually clicking on the pets lol
---
Tauren rogues have war stomp too, you just can't see them cast it.
---
I totally wouldn't be surprised, actually. I was in the exact same spot, I would just bargain that I'd come along if they hit argle every time too. I didn't mention that in my post though because they mention the narglering, and that drops off argle I believe.
---
I believe thats incorrect.  Blizzard have always had a 0 tolerance policy over scamming.
---
As long as it's agreed upon via in game chat by both parties,  its essentially "legally binding in the world of azeroth" 
---
You still may get stuffed over if the person is ignorant and not aware of it but all it will warrant them is a temporary ban (unless more strikes on their account)  and the gold will be refunded to you.
---
So essentially all you need to do is create a character on the destination realm and start asking - if you find someone that's willing to do the trade you're almost there.  IF they go through with it you're set.  If they try and stuff you over you get a minor inconvenience but can feel smug knowing you'll get your gold back and they'll cop a ban :)
---
Bullshit
---
This is actually really good practice. I find a lot of people don‚Äôt actually know how to pvp and think being higher level is all they need.
---
60,44,44,40
---
Ok 45-55 is fine cause that‚Äôs Mara range. By that point, off spec healing gear just doesn‚Äôt cut it without the talents to compensate. I mean i‚Äôm sure some people can make it work. But that‚Äôs kinda masochistic isn‚Äôt it? You can heal Uld in off spec int/spirit gear as feral Druid with out any problem anyway. I mean, we do have 5/5 HotW and innervate for extra mana. Anyone who demands to have a ‚Äúreal‚Äù healer before the 45-55 range is just spoiled. I can open a bottle with a spoon. Is it ideal? No, but it does get the bottle open.
---
That‚Äôs not true I am a level 29 warrior and I attack on site anyone that‚Äôs 3 levels higher than me or less, as long as theyre not in a group...I‚Äôve had tons of random 2v2 world pvp sessions
---
It‚Äôs going to be so awesome looking back in 10 years about this amazing accomplishment !
---
mageweave and runecloth bags still sell on my server (sulfuras) but mageweave is down from &gt;1g per bag to often &lt;85s, and runecloth bags are down in price also. Silk is even cheaper.
---
Still, if you pay attention dusting is the best way to get your money back or turn a profit even over bags, provided you arent leveling yourself
---
Yeah I thought this was interesting. I have yet to be attacked once by a horde my level, yet I've only felt inclined to engage people my level or higher.
---
Not a dagger
---
Nice brag, but good clear times are closer to 1:30.
---
So the best tank and best DPS class in the game has a hard time doing something?
---
So sad.
---
Now we are gonna se 5 man rogue teams killing raids in stealth :D
---
This is the reason why I started playing 10 years ago lol
---
You don't play with Aeon Flux mode enabled?
---
this is why bfa there is no master loot
---
alliance racials are just as good...
---
perception, escape artist, stone form...
---
Phase 2 is gonna be a shitshow here, enough salt to supply chips for a year.
---
Wanna curtail some of tanking?
---
Park your 60 near your lowbie people for mental health
---
Use detect magic not r1 fb.  Unless you have winters chill.  Killing fel hunters is not a sure thing though.  Especially later on when their fel hunters get massive resists.
---
that's pretty much what it is. I got sick of people /1ing "fucking ally scum ganked me" and needing to play 20 questions to find out:
---
    Was this just now or 5 minutes ago?
---
    Did you attack them first?
---
    Are you near me?
---
    What level are they?
---
    What was their name?
---
So I wanted a one button solution to convey all of that and figured that anyone outside of yell range won't give a shit because they're too far to help anyway.
---
This comment.
---
Alliance eventually stop complaint about excessive ?? Level Horde ganks.   It battle hardens us and we don‚Äôt throw in the towel as quick for BGs etc.
---
Best comebacks in BGs have always been on alliance side.  They are fueled my the 100x more times we are ganke while leveling
---
Yea like any other private server they have been on. 
---
When APES start to rank the opposite faction starts to ragequit
---
People keep telling me that saying there‚Äôs always a grp looking for a mage and every time I LFG I spend hours and find one group doing one run and then they all leave
---
I think my problem is I usually tank for guildies who NEED it and are fresh 60s, so every piece of loot gets needed on. And I don't have enough luck with BoE greens to get those.
---
After about 4 hours and a ton of crazy back alley deals with other guilds and even some unsavory alliance to get all the mats, (and about 5k gold) we managed to complete the server first legendary!
---
It's even more impressive if you know that Pagle-US has a 3:1 Alliance to Horde ratio!
---
Take that, Alliance dogs (but thanks for the ingots)!
---
FOR THE HORDE
---
That‚Äôs when you make your own group....

---
Once I hit Ulduman and ZF suddenly I switched from getting groups with bad DPS to getting nonstop groups with bad healers.  Maybe it‚Äôs just finally the level range where being off spec starts to matter? But it‚Äôs beyond that, I‚Äôve died so many times to just healers literally not paying attention, or not coming around corners on LoS pulls and attracting all the casters etc.
---
Not usually, only my least used spells are there like buffs
---
The range spiders seem to always shoot around corners, no matter how far away I run.
---
Why?
---
I WAS HERE
---
Can you tell me what precautionary steps I should take, the only thing I can think of is screenshotting the dialogue at the moment
---
Leeway also makes mage aoe farming really fucking sketchy, I shit you not I got one shot by a pack of the ghouls in WPL from 10 yards away when I went to frost nova them, it's actually absurd how far away you can be melee'd from when you're moving
---
I mean, there are players who enjoy embracing their faction and there are players who don't get too hyped by this "enemy faction = evil" approach.
---
I'm more of the latter. Doesn't mean I don't absolutely love worldpvp on a bigger scale. As for the shit-talking: I think (almost) everybody understands a joke in good spirits. But I also think, that some people do get carried away by that horde vs alliance animosity. I don't know how many players were on that discord server and how often and how playful these jokes are made. Maybe people thought you were serious, maybe they hear the same joke every day and are tired of it. I honestly don't know.
---
But to answer your question: nope, i don't think that there's a significant difference in horde and alliance mentality.
---
There are many harmful stereotypes...
---
Classic/vanilla is all about engineering if you didn't already know that, I'm assuming not by your post. MN is quite good, you can check his vods/old pserver content. If you don't think hes good after watching those, I know you're trolling.
---
that still happens on live.  was leveling a Kul tiern with my friend doing the quests in Duskwood and guess what.  A 120 Druid killing everyone there.   This wasn't even once either.  He was there every night for 6 straight nights.
---
Sounds like you have been on the short end of that stick from the Chads lol. I‚Äôm sorry you didn‚Äôt have a good time. I hope you find a better way to enjoy the game.
---
Tried that too and still never get enough ppl in like hours of looking
---
Except in real life you don't get to pickk the PvE equivalent where no one is allowed to cut you of without your permission. And the only reason you get cutoff is because you chose to be in an environment where everyone can cut each other off.
---
Pretty much exactly what those words mean when joined together into a concept. This isn't a good forum for giving a lesson on it if you don't get it though.
---
I‚Äôm not saying need for greed is broken, I‚Äôm saying most pugs should roll need on epic and certain blue BoEs to prevent ninjas.
---
hey, it's good on a shaman. 1h + Shield fucks up Rogues and Warriors, especially if you go into Shield Spec.
---
I do, but I use a Razer Naga so it doesn't really count.
---
I mean, you‚Äôre at a very popular farm spot that‚Äôs also part of a quest..
---
But less precise and less accurate.
---
Thanks for the heads up.
---
Aoe grind mobs and power quest 
---
Idk where to farm at, I gotta find that info as well
---
Agreed, all of the opposite faction are KOS.  Dont understand all this now pvp stuff.
---
What I do is keep a list of good and bad players via CharacterNotes. Works well since I play both a DPS and a tank so sometimes I'll run into somebody familiar. The guild I'm part of also does the same and we all share lists. Now this is just within our guild, and it's up to you to decide if somebody else's list is legit or not, but it's what we do and it works out well.

I think runecloth bags are still a bit profitable (highly depends on whether someone's going for Darnassus rep at the moment, one player is enough to drive prices way up), but the pattern is camped like crazy. I was lucky enough to get it when I went there to get my mooncloth, but that was relatively early on.
---
I checked some crafting vs disenchanting at several level ranges and didn't find anything profitable. At any level it seems to come at a small loss. Still potentially good enough to get cheap level ups, I suppose.

Gotta remember in original WoW, bindings of the Windseeker wasn't even in the game until BWL patch. (July 2005)
---
60 and 28
---
Your statement doesn't actually connect to what I was talking about except in that they both contain references to video games. You seem to have lost the plot.
---
Spoken like a true Warrior. Loktar ogar.
---
Boss mobs are lvl 63. So yeah they'll resist more.
---
Bigglesworth is great. Very active and, one of the more balanced PvP servers if I‚Äôm not mistaken (55-45 H-A has been thrown around).
---
BWL will be puggable, so you can again reserve the ores, arcanite bars are no problem, you have plenty of time to farm 4-5k gold(for reference there are already people that managed to farm up to 10k gold in less than 2 months of classic). And the boss in silithus? Just get in touch with guild that is ready to finish their Thunderfury and just join their raid.
---
Same here, it‚Äôs nice when you have kids. Easier to find uncontested grind.
---
It's about 65-70% horde at 60 right now based on several censuses a friend of mine and I have done. Seems you bought into the panic as well.

I got invited to a ZF group last week where the warrior group leader said the leather helm from last boss was reserved...and switched loot to master looter before the boss...
---
Like wtf man, its a lvl 40s dungeon.
---
Lmao
---
So how's being 21 and projecting your 17 year old self onto other people on the internet?
---
I‚Äôm not saying confirmation bias isn‚Äôt real. If you read my comment, you would see I simply was telling the other poster  that because I have literally seen a lot of alliance say that undead mages and rogues are KoS. Thanks for trying tho
---
youre porbably using one of the fake walls then. they los just like any other mobs, however if they get their first range shot at you, it goes off a few times before it will start moving again. they fire tracking scarabs, so theyre going to move around corners if fired before youve losd them
---
Fuck. That. Guy.
---
Meh, that only happened when shadowstep(S3, 4?) was the meta cause they sacrificed damage for mobility and then you had the ones who had half PvP half PvE and you still got fucked.

It's not selling at that price right now, it's just being listed at that price.
---
Except it's entirely different for someone to be a decent person in real life than it is in a video game where you and the people you're around all created characters bound to the idea that anyone can kill anyone anywhere without consequences - it's part of the game.
---
Shitty or not, you can't measure the morality of a human being based on how they behave in a video game. This argument is the exact same idea that games like GTA and CoD cause violence. They don't. Someone going around ganking lowbies in WoW doesn't mean they're somehow an indecent human being IRL, or that they would go around murdering people IRL given the chance to do so without consequence. 
---
The core idea that it's a game is what drives people to behave differently. It's not real.
---
I mean, you're not wrong. Classic is a grind. But it's the grind that makes it more special. It makes the world feel larger because it takes longer to get around. Because the enemies are more difficult you, need to be paced going through them or you die. You're not some unstoppable killing machine. It inspires cooperation between players (although this has diminished quite a bit lately) having tougher enemies as well. The long quest chains tell a story, not centered around you like in retail. The world feels like it has things happening and your experiencing them, not that things are happening because of you.
---
I don't think you can make it a safe transaction. It's unsupported by Blizzard so if they run off with your gold you're not getting it back: https://i.redd.it/nl4rx7p3tem31.png
---
Yep! Did I ser you?
---
Dude, this game is about killing each other if you're on a pvp server. It's like signing up for a larger version of battleground. You're making a really bad analogy. People are signing up for this, and no the majority of pvp on pvp servers is not fair, that's part of the strategy to wpvp. You strike when you have an unfair chance of winning.
---
I mean, do you try to draw logical conclusion about people from shooter games too? Why can't everyone just not shoot each other?
---
/u/vredditshare
---
Sounds like someone got teabagged one too many times.

Just wondering, what class are you playing that could possibly lose if the warrior doesn't get the charge?  
---
See, that's why the warrior gets the charge.
---
Lodge a ticket to be 100% assured that what i've said is correct,  they respond at approximately the 24hr mark.
---
Advise the person that the agreement is binding and blizzard will take action if a scam is attempted if they agreed to the trade.
---
Make sure they agree,  screenshot the entire conversation.  
---
So you've got confirmation from blizzard,  You've got the player confirming they understand and agreeing,  screenshots (include time / date stamp)  backing it up and blizzard can easily view their logs to confirm the screenshot is not doctored.  
---
1000% covered that way.

Eh idk. Some people run Strat *just* for that  and only for that. It makes sense they'd reserve it.

In retail wow it became too hard because no one left the cities anymore.

In classic wow, you can camp people for hours who are leveling.

How are you looking?

THANK YOU! Except maybe warriors, cause I feel bad about ganking any warrior.

I don't really see the point in trying to keep things "like 2004" but then having things like Leeway.

Played since launch day , 28 priest. Having lots of fun so far.
---
Just about 42, with girlfriend time, a music festival, concerts, working 40-60 hours a week, playing other games intermittently, and lost a few possible days to moving to a new apartment as well. Slowed down hard at 30 as a warrior, just trying to hit max before the honor system

---
I must admit, I did my first session of lowby killing today in Hillsbrad while meeting up with my leveling friend, and I liked it. I didn't camp, but I did take the territory. Then a shadow priest came and fucked me up 3 times. I deserved it.
---
No, you can't click on someone you can't see. They were probably able to see him in stealth right as they ran up to the banker and didn't notice him before they tried to right click.
---
They end up detectig me right as they get up close. A lot of people spam right clck as they approach something they want to interact with.
---
All the walls cant be fake.  Also why aint this shit fixed already.   I know the fake walls that they walk through.
---
They were most probably close enough to see him stealthed, but didn't process the info before clicking the banker, so they clicked him instead.
---
So woke bro. Please guide us all back to the light!

I've never seen it cast on pets. We usually make people dismiss theirs so the sample size isn't particularly large, though.

&gt;Usually they would write something like "LF1M Healer Arena + Angerforge spam" and I would just write them "I'll heal if you add Golem to it" about 1/3 of them agreed. The other ones spend longer looking for healers.
---
Holy shit really? It's not like Golem adds that much more time on to a run...
---
As a paladin on Kirtonos I look forward to killing your rogue 
---
Have fun :D
---
hur dur i casted polymorph first and get nothing out of it for beating him to it so we both get poly'd
---
I know, all I say is that we as humans, we have our limits and those should be taken on account
---
I just use the Spy add-on, and add every person who ganks me to my KOS list. Then I just just a murder train on them whenever I can.
---
I love it when a priest jumped me in Felwood on my Holy Pally with Seal Of Command Build, I fought and killed him twice in 1vs1. 3rd time he had to bring a Mage and then had the Audacity to spit on me after getting pwnt twice. Some people are just cunts.
---
Im sure the rare will respawn in when i wake up, thats all i know
---
30+ is not a few. Some of us have jobs. So yeah sorry I still don‚Äôt live with parents, and think 16 plus hours of running the same instance is ‚Äúa few‚Äù
---
Because gear at 60 used to be garbage and you used to need 40 level 60s with mostly BIS to kill anything in raid. Plus Onyxia attunements. I was the first priest to 60 in my guild and a lot of people ducked out of runs as soon as they got what they needed.
---
try the server sub reddit
---
That pretty much what skill is in vanilla though... the game isn't complicated enough for people to set themselves apart by raw skill, so game knowledge and time is what sets people apart, both of which they do better than anyone else. 
---
So within the context of vanilla, they are some of the most skilled players in the world without any doubt
---
I don't believe you. Unless this is a well coordinated group with people you have been playing with for a while, you're not clearing it in 45 mins. 
---
And its not necessarily the tanks fault if it takes so long.
---
It's hit or miss. Some groups you get competent people and shit is smooth as butter. 
---
Other times you get hot piles of garbage and wipe to stupid shit.
---
Yes sir. I usually stay awake Friday-Sunday morning.
---
You're not. But if youre arguement is hit is better than crit tell me a hit chest that has more threat value than glad chain, which has more threat value than breastplate.
---
You really think ganking people in Duskwood will spark any kind of meaningful response? You'll be causing inconvenience to lowbies and that's all there is to it.
---
But I‚Äôve only seen the horde do this...
---
I've been running with pets out, ready to send him to his "stay" position in the safe spot, but nothing happened yet. I'm fully prepped to cheetah and run over and start dismissing if Bomb hits him though. Losing 8% DPS to have an AH bomb in my pocket is so worth it.
---
Yes sir. Sometimes more

Is devilsaur mafia really a thing in Benediction? Been see-ing posts lately about how it's somewhat impossible to farm devilsaur leather due to everyone farming for it.
---
Seems to me like it's more cost + time effective for me to just buy the gauntlets + leggings from the AH(comes out to around 200+ gold) as opposed to getting my leatherworking up to 300 + doing the tribal leatherworking + farming for the devilsaur leather/pattern.
---
Yea, it was scary to leave, but I'm having a good time on EF: it peaks at about medium, but that's the same size as a full server in 2004 plus its only 1 layer. Economy is a bit slower, but I kinda of like the tighter knit community where you can get to know people. My guild of like 10 people moved over and havent looked back.

Seriously. This. There‚Äôs only so much watching videos online can help you. You learn the flow, audio cues, what to look out for and the general strategy (lultankandspank). But it‚Äôs kinda like studying your route before you drive, you retain more when you‚Äôre actually driving your car to where you wanna go. So just go in the run, learn as much as you can, and when you run it again (trust me, you‚Äôll run it many more times) you‚Äôll be even more prepared than you were last time. And so on and so forth until you‚Äôre the guy saying ‚Äúskip this? Jed runs anyone? We need to get that thing so we can do the other thing.‚Äù
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Just remember you aren‚Äôt alone. There are many who stood where you are today, feeling what you‚Äôre feeling. When you learn more, you‚Äôll run into someone who knows less, they‚Äôll speak up, and you‚Äôll be more than happy to teach them what you‚Äôve learned. So speak up. Tell them you‚Äôre a little inexperienced but eager to learn. Someone will be more than happy to explain it to you.
---
I use to tank and heal in my younger years...now I just do not care for the attitude we get when a DPS does something stupid.
---
I once was healing.  Damn DPS guy kept pulling aggro of tank and sucking my mana dry trying to keep him vertical.  I finally said "keep that up and I wont heal you"  well he kept it up and died.  Starting going off in chat about me sucking and tank sucking.  I said if he was not kicked I would leave...two seconds later we had a new DPS and happily on our way and I had to block the guy spamming me hate messages.
---
Yeah but have you experienced full strength curse of agony tapping lowbies in redridge? It just takes one spell. Some run, some wait. Others try to kill me. When enough finally realize it's not retail and they can actually kill me and succeed in that, nothing feels better than CoA ALL of the filthy blues, dying, then resurrecting on the spot to type /lol with my evil, evil undead laugh. 
---
Muahahahahaha.
---
If it's red it's dead.
---
Never played one, nice strawman though, tiger.
---
We kicked a guy from our guild because he was proudly saying that he was ganking lowbies 15 levels under him. A rogue, on skeram... horde... I would be curious to know the name of the streamer ;)
---
I did it a ton in Vanilla with guildies. It's a great way to get the Horde lowbies to call in reinforcements to get some real PvP going without having to worry about aggroing extra mobs. Nothing starts a good fight like a little revenge motivation!
---
So where's the top thread of people claiming this is a horde thing?
---
We had a hunter argue with us tonight that HoJ was a BiS for h and he was rolling on it of it dropped.
---
I'd say there's skill in 1v1 or 1vX pvp, not in mass pvp.
---
Ofcourse it is, but when i say engineering here i mean just mass sapper charging unsuspecting raids.
---
You are out of your mind. Thinking that races/factions do not reflect a person's personality is really stupid. You really think that some long haired guy wearing metal t-shirts has the same general personality as an anime t-shirt wearing waifu pillow hugging weeb?
---
Org has a back foot to thrall
---
Undercity... sucks for everyone lol
---
I'd say overall things are in pretty good balance, but playing Alliance it's hard not to notice some patterns. Horde establishments tend to be close to the center of areas and have high level guards.
---
Barrens may be slow but it's also ungankable. Meanwhile Alliance players have to sweat it out in Redridge which is routinely camped by high level Hordes.
---
For anyone curious who is telling the truth here, go watch the VOD starting about 10mins after this clip. The ninja clearly acted in his own interests and not for the players of the guild. The post on the server subreddit by Hamished is either the work of a liar or a lunatic.

Ah yes, the unwavering rigidity of "playing something that isn't technically the most optimal just fine," and "telling someone who says it's impossible that it is in fact possible, but that they are correct that it is probably not the most optimal." I am sorry you have had to deal with this, sir.

Unless you are on when pops are low, dungeons

If I had photoshop skills I'd give Mr. Jhaz Thang a sax. He needs one.
---
Fucking everywhere in hillsbrad. Its even worse when theyre ranged and they attack you while theyre sitting in a pack of mobs in hillsbrad so you cant even defend yourself. Chicken shit.
---
I actually think it's a bannable issue if somebody does not give notice about what the raid rules sre before hand, i would imagine it falls under ninja looting.
---
blackcrow or carapace spine xbow are probably both better than your current gun. 2.6 is trash
---
Depends on the size of the loottable, for how many items on reserve is reasonable tbh. And if the people organizing the group have been organizing groups for that dungeon for a long time and still haven't gotten their few items they needed. Like I and a friend as tank and healer have been organizing like 50 runs for LBRS, and still hadn't gotten Blackcrow and the last gem from Voone (lost the latter to people that only been with us for 1 or 3 runs, and then never seen them again). You're damn right we're then asking reserve on those two items out of the large loot table that LBRS has got. If not, then we would've just stopped running the dungeon at all, and the queues are far longer for dps than they are for tanks and healers. If people want the same privileges as tanks, healers and people that organize groups, then more people should roll tanks, healers and organize groups.
---
Undercity has a backdoor through the sewer straight to Sylvanas
---
I mean, your guild is upfront about it.  People can now easily avoid your guild if they were wanting BoP's and crafting materials.
---
If you arent already high LW, yes buy it. Could try for kills at lowish pop times
---
Just need everything and vendor/disenchant
---
Clearly I'm retarded because I believe there should be a reason to why people do dungeons.
---
But hey, keep on needing on all loot, even if other people need it just because you want that gold.
---
Thats called eagle method. You hover your index finger over the keyboard till you find the key you're looking for and then with extreme precision dive down for that prey or in this case, the desired key.
---
By then you wouldn't run enough warlocks to warrant bothering with it in the first place. Not worth sacrificing healing power to boost 2 warlocks by 15%.

---
Yep, I had no idea about this. I joined alliance because the towns are better made and the environment just looks better.
---
And I find out that its impossible to quest without getting ganked by hordes... Usually they are my level but always 2 or 3 questing closeby while I'm alone they will try to kill me, but if I do manage to kill one, suddenly 2 level 60 come and gank me for ever even killing me at the graveyard. For what? Because I defended myself against a Horde attacking me. It made leveling up a real pain. Im level 54 now and glad its almost over (got ganked by a group of 5 level 60 today while questing again and no alliance on the horizon of course.) I really regret choosing pvp
---
About most things I would be fine with if modified for classic. As long as class utility is kept and overworld isn't neglected.
---
You guys are a bunch of carebears. In classic. It was killed or be killed.
---
Info might be hard to get. Log on all the servers at your usual play time and give them a look. Trade chat can be mostly helpful
---
i played during vanilla wow so dont jump the gun little man, and whats the point in thanking someone for making a game that was supposed to be so difficult, so easy?
---
It isn't, no accuracy or precision is relevant when you're just saying you are not one of two things. We learned what a false dichotomy for alternatives or false dilemma for opposing ideas in like fucking Year 10. You're basically like Jimmy Neutron from the Salt vs. Sodium Chloride meme trying to convince everyone that you're smart by over complicating your speech deliberately. 
---
Pompous. I was right the first time.

---
Why don't the dps git gud?
---
What you said doesn‚Äôt make sense, I charge people who will most
---
Likely beat me, I have charged level 36 mages as a a lvl 28 and died but happy that I almost won...I charge people I wk almost certainly lose against and often do, and I don‚Äôt pick on lower level players
---
People on popular servers crowd the respawn points and tag them as soon as they spawn. Unless you can frequently play during off hours you are better off just grinding for gold and buying stuff
---
Was gonna day this
---
It was a joke, and it went over your head
---
FOR THE HORDE!!!
---
It's always the increase players, too...
---
Trolls, orcs and Tauren players generally leave me alone but undead players (usually fucking rogues, shadow priests and warlocks) just seem to go out of their way to be little shits, lol
---
Just remember needing gold is always a valid reason to need on a drop, don't let others tell you otherwise they're just taking advantage of you.
---
I personally already began disliking the game with Wotlk. I liked how much better the questing areas became with cata, but disliked how braindead the leveling became. 
---
There are things I like about the expansions but there are a lot more things I dislike.
---
Bc had more stuff I liked than disliked. Wotlk dungeon finder was good in theory but dungeons became too easy and especially the daily heroic was just a stupid grind afer Ulduar was released.
---
Cata I cant really say much about because I had no real drive. But the raidfinder was stupid and all the daily quests got very grindy. But I stopped playing relatively early into it. MoP I didnt play. WoD, raids were cool in design, but that browsergame stuff was just stupid. Also I kinda only logged in for the raids because I had nothing else to do.
---
45-60 is the longest part of the leveling experience where people will spend almost half of their time leveling. I would almost argue that dungeons prior to that level range aren‚Äôt worth doing more than once without a premade group anyway.
---
Not only that, 40+ is the point where you have enough talent points for your talents to actually make a difference in your combat or healing efficiency and potency.
---
My guild's warriors 2 or 3 man arena, you definitely don't need a big group to farm it effectively if arena is all you're going for.
---
19
---
I wouldn't say significantly, but Horde definitely have better travel options in general. There's just no good way to get to the northern half of Eastern Kingdoms for Alliance is the biggest one, just gonna have to take a long flight path to get there while the Horde can get a port or Zeppelin to UC real quick.
---
Alliance have more fleshed out starting zones, but they have less quests overall, especially in that 30-40 range where quests suck to get for both sides.
---
Overall, Alliance is better for raiding because Paladins are insane, fear ward is better than tremor totem, and the racials are really well suited for raiding (Sword specialization for humans and % increased int for gnomes being big ones), but Horde definitely win in PvP with Will of the Forsaken, Orc Stun Resist, War Stomp, etc.

&gt; If your guild is using 16 debuff slots (doubtful at this stage of content), a double resist means an important debuff will be pushed off in order to re-apply the debuff quickly. 
---
Wouldn't mindflay result in the same, since it takes up a debuff slot?
---
Good luck.
---
Where do you check faction balance?
---
How? Certain classes have certain roles they are expected to perform. If I invited a DPS and they refused to press their DPS buttons because they just didn't feel like it, they would be getting kicked. That's not toxic. If I invited a water maker and they refuse to press their water making buttons because they don't feel like it, they are getting kicked. Same thing.
---
we are good tho. If the tank cant hold aggro, it's his own fault ;)
---
You could think about it any other way, what do you get by saving on 1 the of raid time when the reset is only every week?

&gt;behind in this way.

---
Every single PvP server was horde favored at launch except the streamer server I think. Only reason there are alliance favored servers now is because of transfers. I think it‚Äôs unlikely blizzard will do anything because they‚Äôve never cared about faction balance on servers in the past. It really sucks. I started on Stalagg and left to Heartseeker because all of my friends were going to quit and now we just have the opposite problem. Playing PvP servers with enormous a faction imbalances sucks and blizzard should do something to find a solution.

If the dps pulls agro it's their fault.

yes. either way you choose to keep that 5-stack of weaving from falling off, AFTER a mind blast resist. your two choices both put up a debuff (swp and flay)

&gt; Paladins don't have a tank but they still have options to snap back aggro, especially with Engineering.

How does Engi help with aggro?
---
If it only showed the second screenshot with horde counter charging.
---
All non meta/optimal specs rejoice at once
---
I bet that mage had a great time in WC runs
---
Details? I missed this.
---
If the mage died five times, he's awful.
---
FTH! Alliance are pussies.
---
Lol this is next level petty move on with your life dude ffs
---
Oh my God this needs to be a thing.
---
Lol minmaxer calling other people rigid.
---
Those players that are officers and are responsible with who they add aren't the ones that go on a power trip and tell people their guild or multiple guilds are blacklisting the person and ignore without giving the person a chance to defend themselves. They quietly decide to not have their people group with the person and move on. I think we're talking about very different situations.
---
This is how it worked in legit vanilla. Hunter shots have weird things about them in pvp and pve. 
---
Example: a level 1 hunter can fairly easily hit a level 50 mob. He wont do any kind of damage but he'll still hit most shots unlike the other classes
---
Yeah I'm just reading about all the problems in this thread with some popcorn while I complete my quests with no corpse running
---
That's the magic of PvP tbh
---
tfw they dont understand that you can kill more stuff faster in a group, than solo, so XP/minute is better.
---
For me personally, my girlfriend goes to bed aylt 930 server and raid time ends at 10 server so if we finish by 9 I can go chill with gf before she falls asleep.
---
I too have loot rules macros, but I tend not to need to use them. They are great ideas and very useful.
---
Thats all classic/vanilla wow is. A massive grind.
---
After this great accomplishment, you must now turn your attention to the east....
---
For now it is time for the tides of darkness to rise again, the Alliance must be crushed.
---
oh boy another child has appeared!
---
Obviously you've never played human race which literally has the pvp trinket racial
---
I feel that priest's pain. [Charstone Dirk](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17710/charstone-dirk) dropped off Princess in Mara the past weekend, and I was the only caster in the group. 11 int and 2 mana per 5 seconds on a dagger.
---
Rogue rolled need and won, then said "whoops, thought it was offhand." Schmuck.
---
lol, I tank with specific people now in a pool of about 20 for the very reasons you described.  
---
Being told I'm a bad tank because the dps started AOE nuking while I was walking towards the pack of mobs and I couldn't hold aggro on every last one of them is a bit frustrating.
---
46 Priest, 27 Druid
---
I think I trashed my skull of impending doom... Am I fucked?
---
Love that dude.
---
Had a horde hunter. Same level attack my Paladin today in Desolace as I was swimming back from the naga quest. Chased him from the bay to the tower until he got too far away so I just switch to his pet and killed it. He came back so I killed him. Had spent an hour or more in that zone. Seen tons of horde,  none bothered me. A few days ago, a shamen came across me just after a few chain pulls. I was drinking/eating and I guess he saw an easy target. Same level. Missed timed my bubble so he got me. Most other times it‚Äôs a few trying to hang up. Add to the experience i suppose. As long as it‚Äôs not high levels just being assholes.
---
After reading this thread I went to check out of curiosity. I am on Skeram as Horde and I went to check whether a realm transfer is possible. It seems at the moment that at server transfers from Skeram are disabled. I don't think the currently remaining alliance can leave even if they want to.
---
Yep, I want BIS attack animations.
---
2 weeks! Yikes
---
Just got killed by a gnome mage today.  9 levels higher while I was mid fight.. I need to find him and get revenge
---
What you fail to realize is that most groups are formed because they share the common goal of doing the same bosses or quests, once people no longer have a need for that dungeon, e.g are fully geared they're likely to stop doing it and instead do more efficient farming. Yet you're demanding tanks to help you past that because it's their 'role' when in reality it should still be about having a common goal of clearing the dungeon were you get your gear and the tank makes a bunch of money from the unwanted loot.
---
I've had two fucked up loot situations in classic, both included mages. First mage needed and got Cruel barb, second mage needed and got Painweaver band cause "I need crits".
---
It one shots anyone in melee range?

You're no Soldier of Lordaeron.  They all rest beneath the ground.  
---
Now, so shall you.
---
Read through the replies and I'm sure you can piece together the person
---
Are you agreeing with me? Cause the tone implies that you‚Äôre disagreeing with me when we‚Äôre basically saying the same thing. I‚Äôm saying 45+ would have an easier time healing when specced into it. You‚Äôre saying 40+ is when healing efficiency from talents is noticeable. I‚Äôm saying any time before 45 does not require to be specced into healing, just have the appropriate gear. You‚Äôre saying that any dungeon before 45 isn‚Äôt worth doing, so if that‚Äôs the case then spec doesn‚Äôt matter. I feel like we‚Äôre on the same damn page.
---
Not a fan of athene but I just watched the full interview and idk.. the journalist honestly seems to be grasping at straws. It's not like Athene is denying the girl was psychologically abused, but the girl herself is denying it now, so how can we just call her a liar by dismissing her current stance on it?
---
Lol, that name is gold. You got lucky!
---
Mages have been alright, I dont know if they're really good or bad but their AOEs help a lot. It's warriors the ones that have always been the impatient ones in my group
---
People are much more efficient at making money now, and way more people will be farming dire maul tribute runs (if they‚Äôre even possible) and putting more gold into the economy.
---
I don't play on their server, how are they toxic?
---
I mean. If you had 2/3rd's + the members then yeah.. fair game to res a legendary and patterns/formulas.
---
This guy is cranky. That's for sure.
---
Well in theory if you're doing mainly dungeons and big pulls that require consecration and your healer isn't struggling to keep you alive then sure int might actualy be better.
---
I'm more of a solo leveler so I take 3-4 mobs at a time and drink and it's just fine. In dungeons I also take as many mobs but I just finished two cathedral runs back to back and I only drank 4 times during those two runs while wearing full str/stam gear.
---
Sir Daniel Fortesque is missing one of his eyes and his bottom jaw, so nope, great game tho, maybe I'll draw him sometime
---
ORRRR maybe you dislike being called out on the fact that this kind of logic shows a complete and utter lack of respect for other people's time, and what it does, is it actually advocates this kind of stupidity, by creating a provision for this unacceptable behavior to be forgiven or even repeated. Don't forget, people also pay to play this game. 
---
If I'm not mistaken, the kind of investment in time and concentration it takes for a collection of 33-35 other players, excluding the perpetrators, goes beyond weeks or even months of dedicated preparation and even that can be quantified in game dollars and cents.
---
So in closing, since you don't have respect for yourself in terms of time u invest in bettering your avatar, or the money you earn to pay to play this game, you are a pristine example of the little-paper-man I described, not having the conviction to do what so many people in this thread have already mentioned, re: kicking these players out of the guild. Seems to me that you're the one out of touch with reality.
---
Why is everyone so in favour of layering? On my server anyone who questions layering is abused with messages about how it's great and you're just a whiny loser. It's crazy.
---
Succubus is helpful to get the initial opener off, but she is squishy as fuck and you gotta be pretty good on the seduce timing so you use it to your advantage. Felhunter is good too, but only really effective against casters. I just remember Succubus being my pvp let of choice in Vanilla just because of Seduce
---
mouseover macros for me are something like
---
#showtooltip
---
/cast [target=mouseover,help,nodead][help][target=player] Spell Name(Rank #)
---
to use mods to have different effects its something like
---
/cast [mod:shift] [target=mouseover,help,nodead][help][target=player]Spell Name(Rank #)
---
/cast [nomod] [target=mouseover,help,nodead][help][target=player]Spell Name(Rank #)
---
Traitors fill their ranks brother! Let your blades cut cleanly and find their belly‚Äôs first!
---
That‚Äôs not in classic bud.
---
Lol, been bushwhacked by the undead mage and lock groups a few times. or shaman/hunters but they usually try to 1v1.
---
Been playing exactly like this for over a decade. Don‚Äôt know why more people don‚Äôt do it. Also use F index and V for thumb. I have small hands so it‚Äôs much easier than reaching all the number keys
---
I tank with a 2 hander.
---
I'm a bear.
---
Going to go ahead and say you're a joke
---
Yes he does.
---
So I just got banned by one of the largest guilds on Windseeker for saying something pro-HK in general chat.
---
https://i.redd.it/2cu54ccmffs31.jpg
---
So that's interesting.
---
Then you'll love watching Monkeynews' vids on YouTube where he's 1v4ing people as a warrior lol.
---
Lol.. Imagine spending gold on dungeon loot... LOL
---
Obviously hyper anecdotal but for most people I imagine after raid they just continue farming whatever anyway lol
---
Both of these trinkets are very, very good. I use the Mara trinket for DPS when questing, otherwise for tanking, and the Hinterlands trinket has 1% hit which is awesome until you get enough hit gear that can wear something else.
---
You wanted the classic wow experience didn‚Äôt you?
---
Bobby?
---
I said it, and unfortunately followed through...the bodies I camped in STV for hours. I should be ashamed.
---
Dark mode: don't worry I'll protect your eyes.  
---
/U/bruthar: watch this
---
&gt;What next? Change skin color? Introduce transmog?
---
LFR? New talent system? Garrisons? Who knows, the possibilities are endless!!
---
Stop with this slippery slope nonsense.
---
Alliance players exist in a perpetual state of ‚Äúbutt hurt‚Äù. 
---
It is their way.
---
*classic 80s jazz sax solo*
---
I liked the BC and WOTLK balance of the two. You weren‚Äôt a god but the world didn‚Äôt feel like such a bland grind (dailies sucked, but I loved wrath).
---
I absolutely love energy. Don't have a stupid 5 second cast rule and don't need to worry about some converted resource based on attacks.
---
Every 2 seconds, I get 20 energy. Doesn't matter what my stats are, what abilities I used, attacks, or time. It's always the same, in combat and out. Always ticking on the same timer.
---
Where does the hydraxian chain start?
---
2h tanking is far superior up until sunken Temple and still useful towards 60 with SS+WW on pull for absurd amounts of threat, you just put on the shield afterwards.
---
that made me laugh harder than the 1 hour comedy special i just watched...
---
One time I saw a Rogue going half health while fighting the mobs. I just ran through him and /wave, since I'd start the quest and didnt want to look over my shoulder every 5 seconds. 30 sec later, that fucker healed up and tried to kill me.
---
Fucking alliance scum.
---
I don't have it in me to gank someone even 3 levels below me let alone the 20+ lvl differential I see the horde doing constantly...
---
Why do they do this? I've noticed the skull level horde with fancy looking gear are the biggest perpetrators. Guess it makes sense; if you've already done most of the end game content and real life isn't going well, why not gank helpless players of the opposing faction?
---
Yes, correct. In addition to being able to quest I am also great fun in parties. People love a holy spec healer.
---
Uhhhh
---
Lol what a comment
---
Eh, 
---
Shadowfang 17.8 dps 2.7 AS 30 dmg proc 
---
vs 
---
cruel barb at 15.6 dps 2.8 AS + 12 AP
---
It definitely is best in slot but cruel barb is free.
---
I think some of the raging is actually from people joining groups that didn't post reserved loot until later in runs or as the item drops.
---
I did get the crumpled note from outside the instance.....
---
Because every run turns into a reserve run.
---
and yet you complain about people‚Äôs wholesome posts :((((( poor you
---
Redridge and duskwood are so efficient as questing hubs, it raises the efficiency of horde camping lowbies too. Like where do you even go to camp lowbie horde that are as densely populated as redridge?
---
It doesn't actually higlight guilds, but highlights everything written inside &lt;this&gt;
---
If you feel that classic is just not for you, I play on a private server set in mists of pandaria that is free and super easy to get on. Just google tauriwow it takes like 5 minutes to set up.
---
Honestly I've found it's really fun to main-spec as a healer on one of my alts.  I don't want to heal 24/7, but when I do, I'm one hell of a healer.  And then I go back to melting things on my lock.
---
Do live strath runs and reserve 1st orb. Every tank does this on my server. I never join any of those runs but must be working out for them.
---
Thanks heaps. Yes I‚Äôm playing on arugal. I googled and came up with a blue post that said the option to migrate is only available when there‚Äôs a que. you‚Äôre a legend mate. What have it away that I was on arugal? Also my server is 70-30 in favour of horde so It‚Äôs going to be interesting.
---
My server doesn‚Äôt seem as bad. I‚Äôve been given a pass by a lot of the ?? I come across. It‚Äôs usually the ones my level starting shit. But I‚Äôve also seen alliance dipshits instigating violence and had to deal with the reckoning with the ?? Came  to clean out the questing area so his friends could finish their quest.
---
Dual spec. Hybrids need this big time. You'd see fewer shadowpriests healing arms warriors in dungeons if they had an option to play healer / tank respectively without completely ruining their leveling / farming experience.
---
Do you think it was actually John Paul Jones? I could see him playing WoW...
---
It doesn't not
---
That sites so terrible for warrior it‚Äôs a meme in the class discord. Is it actually acceptable for other classes?
---
Look for swolenbenji rouge guides on YT. He will help you a lot!
---
I vaguely remember another staffer said they were looking at a fun way to make note of that event as well. I think they'll do something but I doubt it'll be hardcore like the original was.
---
Pretty sure that already ended, hopefully blizz only open transfers like this for population sake and not paid transfers for any server in the future. 
---
Also with the internet and reddit etc nowadays I think if you‚Äôre really shitty even transferring won‚Äôt help if word gets out
---
I watched the VOD and know that you are telling the truth here. I disagree with the mageblade decision, but regardless, disagreeing with the way the officers voted does not legitimize his behavior here.
---
Not really. Could have spent that time gaining xp
---
It does indeed only give skill for 1h sword/axe and dagger.
---
If you‚Äôre serious please talk to someone

How much of a mental invalid do you have to be to think this behavior is faction specific
---
At the same time, as a Horde I have to set my hearth in Kargath and need to use portals whenever I need to go to a city.
---
Oh man I have always exclusively played Lock and wanted to RP on WoW. I gotta get into this.
---
35 hunter and 30 rogue. About 2.5 days played on each. 
---
Was flipping between them, but decided I need to get *someone* to 60 before phase 2 makes leveling a shit show. So forging ahead with the hunter, and I‚Äôll pick the rogue back up down the road.
---
I'm confused, why do people level as disc? The perks you get for leveling are very minimal compared to holy, both for healing and damage. Holy nova is very legit in aoe dungeon groups, too.
---
For glory's sake. For vengeance sake. WAR!
---
Nice blog post.
---
This is awesome. We need more heros. Be sure to post lots of pictures after you land in hong kong and help protest. 
---
Reddit took 150 million dollars from china to suppress anti Chinese posts, so I‚Äôm not sure where you will post said pictures.... God speed, hero.
---
yeah, i'm way meaner to people in real life than i am in video games.......and i'm really mean in video games.
---
If you‚Äôre curious of the truth here, go watch the vod starting at about 5 mins after this clip was taken. Hamish is lying. The vod clearly shows the entire guild joining a voice chat after the incident and disagreeing with/debunking Hamish‚Äôs claims.
---
Fun for people who are bad at pvp and can't win actual competitive content.
---
Image taken at 7pm on sunday is what I bet. This is how my server looks 2 am on wednesday.
---
Way more dude, have you seen tanaris or everlook?
---
Would you expect anything else from neckbeards?
---
How can you blame a business for running a business..
---
If I get attacked by a group of opposing faction, when I'm minding my own business, I'll spend the next 2 hours ganking lowbies.
---
These guys felt like they took longer to tether and they just appeared out of thin air already aggroed on us
---
Nah I knew I would be accepted as a priest but I also knew having fear ward would ensure maximum acceptance rates :). Didn‚Äôt want to be that guy who someone tells ‚Äúsorry we just got a reply from a dwarf priest and we‚Äôre going with him for this MC run‚Äù. Haha
---
Should have been kill quest.
---
Sargeras when he sees weird alien gods appearing on planets
---
I'll be rubbing my ugly greens in their faces.
---
Yes. The mount is so rare that most people won't even care. They are there for the loot. Someone reserving something that isn't going to drop anyway changes nothing.
---
Because majority of people would tip like 1g for this so a fee has to be made for super rare enchants. Good luck finding an enchant like this for just a tip.
---
2h tanking works at lower level dungeons, but at higher I agree. Now I‚Äôm only 47 arms warrior but what I do is Charge-&gt;  Bloodrage-&gt; Sweeping strikes-&gt; Berserker Rage-&gt; Whirlwind. This is how I establish great intial Aggro on a pack, but after that I immediately switch to D stance sword n board, but starting off the pull with that rotation gives me a great start for threat especially if people follow the marks I put on, and even then in AoE situations. I hardly lose threat after that usually only times I have issues is if the healer screws up, or just isn‚Äôt very good, which happens a lot now, or I have an oddly higher level in my group, like today when I had a 53 mage in my ZF group, but even then I still held threat pretty well,  but that mage was also competent and didn‚Äôt go Ham right away.
---
Chinaaaa..Naaa..na,nana! Money is money!
---
DID SOMEONE SAY AOE?
---
They are always camped on my server. Even at 3am.
---
When is APES going to do a completely naked MC run?
---
Horde players are more patriotic about it because they're the underdogs.
---
Or they're just having fun with it and you're all a bunch of sensitive assholes for caring about RPers having fun
---
I disagree with the last part of what you said about being spoiled because you want real healers.
---
If you‚Äôre dedicated to leveling via dungeons, don‚Äôt just say ‚ÄúI‚Äôll heal‚Äù to get groups faster. The healer really helps set the pace for the dungeon. 
---
Also I said dungeons below 45ish aren‚Äôt worth doing more than once (quest runs). At those levels you level so fast anyway and there‚Äôs so many quests. When you get up to the 45-60 range you actually will have to grind. There‚Äôs plenty of good spots to grind in dungeons for this level range. Lots of people do the zf zombies and the various brd runs.
---
Also, holy and disc priests can level just fine outside of dungeons. Even resto druids can level just fine. Having a second gear set for questing solo is always a good idea. Plus there‚Äôs tons of groups you can join to do quests and kill elites in a lot of different zones. Healer spec leveling is completely viable.
---
I like it, I hope you start a trend.
---
I don‚Äôt reserve anything but maybe they just want the mount?
---
How did this guy reserving a mount mean he‚Äôs a gigantic asshole and has an ego problem?
---
Geeze. Take a break from reddit and the game for a bit if this is how you react to things.
---
I have taken to going bear form and /sit on the goblins in the inn. I have killed 5-10 horde that way in the past few days.
---
How was he acting like it was "real pvp"? Because he was streaming it? You just sound salty. Stay on PvE.
---
 Payo with his poggers in the chatttuuhhh
---
There are many people with both, very low self-esteem and skill, that try to boost their egos by stomping the shit out of grey/green equipped, leveling people with the best available level 19 items and level 60 enchants once battlegrounds come out.
---
:(
---
It‚Äôs more a culture thing.
---
Reserve runs didn‚Äôt used to be a thing back in vanilla. You wanted a piece of loot, then you ran the dungeon/raid until you won it. No one reserved loot, so every run became an ‚Äúopportunity‚Äù. This was good wow culture that was inclusive.
---
Now. All the runs being advertised have a reserved stipulation, sure it‚Äôs your choice to join or not, but if you need the item that is already reserved, you won‚Äôt run it, so now we have a ‚Äòbad LFG culture‚Äô that‚Äôs exclusionary. 
---
The reserving culture came from later iterations of retail and private servers where an abundance of players meant spots could still be filled even if you alienate 60% of the server with your specific reserve on a BiS item. Someone not achievable with the smaller population sizes of OG vanilla servers.
---
This etiquette is not apparent to you as you were not an OG vanilla player. The infiltration off reserve culture is a ‚Äúchange‚Äù that the #nochange camp of players are unwelcome to.
---
On day 1 I fucked up the time zone timing and missed the launch, blizz were already starting to open new servers and arugul had a huge queue. Glad I dodged that bullet, yojambros foreva
---
I play on myzrael, alliance. i‚Äôm in a huge, awesome guild. and it‚Äôs always packed on the server, but no wait Q‚Äôs. loving it. HMU in game of you decide you want to pop into the server (A-Side) - Ignasious.
---
It‚Äôs a shame what‚Äôs going on but Hong Kong is not the center of the world.
---
lol, let me guess, you play a mage?
---
GRIND seems to stack up pretty well from what I have seen on stream and Gehennas is horde heavy so wouldn't bet so sure.
---
You dont need people but you can fill empty slots and give people a chance to get gear.
---
I know you're an alliance pussy xD
---
He doesn‚Äôt know.
---
Okay, let me talk to myself a bit and I'll get back to you.
---
I think it‚Äôs just a fad
---
Most will come back
---
Blizzard makes some of the best games out, kinda hard to stop playing them
---
But then again, maybe so
---
Idk, I need classic to past the time, I can‚Äôt give it up, nothing else really compares
---
Why do you expect more from blizz than any other corporation?   This is ridiculous.
---
It would've been more merciful to kill him.
---
Sexy sax void demon
---
Yes, but that is Hamish‚Äôs version of the story. Go watch the VOD beginning 5 minutes after the clip was taken. The guild reforms and joins a discord channel to discuss what happened. No one agreed with Hamish‚Äôs claims; no one felt the guild was being run unfairly. Hamish actually went and deleted all of his messages in DMs with other officers to hide evidence of his prior disputes. 
---
A player on Arugal known as Anchorman apparently has been writing drama news articles and will soon post on this topic. Wait for his article before you decide to believe Hamish. 
---
God I love juicy drama
---
I'm amazed there's actually someone alive not knowing this
---
lmao.. that guy is a hero

Aren't you blowing things out of proportion you think?

Right now it is. But what about in later phases where armor is higher?

Jump continents and do the other side. Or might be able to hit south shore.

Just remember that people who act pathetic in a game have a equally pathetic real life.

The way you counter it is bubble hearth. :)

I mean because enh isn‚Äôt a good dueling spec or even a good pvp class but he‚Äôs a good player with good gear.
---
I just watched the full VOD from after the clip. Apparently that post, and Hamish as a whole, is full of shit. The guild and all of its members wholeheartedly disagree with Hamish‚Äôs characterization of unfairness in the way the guild was being run. Hamish is a liar and a ninja.
---
Warrior is 54, mage is 23
---
This is exactly why I refuse to tank any dungeons for anyone outside of friends and guild. The PUG dps are so bad and I‚Äôm sick of them bitching about me not holding aggro when they drop blizzard on an entire pack of mobs before I ever even get a single melee attack off.
---
I lack the skills to do this myself, but I know a lot of coders. I'll see if I can get one of them interested.
---
Yeah. But raid frames.. üò≠
---
I heard its like an x ray to the chest
---
"10 in an hour" 
---
Nothing better to do I guess huh?
---
Games are dead the moment someone can't instantly find a group for something they want to do. People have been conditioned for instant gratification that skew their perspective on what dead actually is in my experience.
---
What?  How?  DM should be on tuesday
---
Oh, would you share that list? It sounds magnificent.
---
thats the way to go. As a warrior tank still leveling i def roll on all arms gear. I quest as much as I tank so i care about the dps gear. I'm a casual that rerolled 5 times so im super low level but sense i am probably going to be a pvper i will probably tank end game with intent of being Arms just for pvp.
---
I tend to just go do something else lol.
---
I want pvp at 60, just not corpse camping by people 10+ over me xD. I'm not normally too bothered by it, but I also have other stuff to do in life
---
You are in for a treat phase 2 my friend.

My wife and I were doing a swimming quest off of the coast of Arathi and there was a Tauren druid about 6 levels higher than us questing in the same area. At one point he put entangling roots on my wife but that was it. Later, as she's looting this quest item, he just starts attacking and I'm off getting another quest item and so I can't save her ^([lik dis if u cry evertim])
---
I'm a holy pally so I was just like "Ugh, fuck this guy, and I'm fucked because he's got water form so even if I can beat him he'll just swim away." Well, turns out he didn't know how to do *anything*. Didn't switch to water form to run away, just panicked and swam backwards. He knew Entangling Roots, Moonfire, Wrath, and whatever that other balance cast is. After I cast Blessing of Freedom on myself, he tried 3 times in a row to cast roots.
---
I'm a holy pally and I beat this guy no problem. It was the most gruesome beating. Imagine how long it must take for a holy pally to slowly beat a level 40 druid to death with Verigan's Fist.
---
I sometimes feel like I'm bad at PvP without the full arsenal of abilities that BC introduced but then I get into these fights and feel better about myself.
---
Tell me you didn't buy his arcanite bars for him...
---
Is that Bronjahm's long lost void walker? Keep it safe until wrath and return him to the forge of souls!

But Chris has painted the narrative those in the Cult are being manipulated (he doesn't explain this is formed from Emotional neglect) Athene is a modern day philosopher with a faded grip on reality.

I've had this exact issue the last two times I've tried downloading the mac launcher. It's been ages, not sure why it's not fixed. 
---
Anyway, I just googled Mac battlenet launcher mirror and downloaded it from elsewhere. You don't have to get the current version because it'll update itself.
---
If you get desperate PM me and I'll send you a google drive link.
---
Scarlet Monastery. It has 4 different instances. Graveyard-&gt;Library-&gt;Arms-&gt;Cathedral. You should be just fine doing the first 3!
---
When an alliance player purposely goes to zones ten levels below him to gank because he knows he‚Äôd get thrashed on an even playing field...
---
On his stream he talked about it like he wasn't shooting fish in a barrel. Also, no and no.
---
OMFG that's an amazing troll!
---
Is having fun and getting some laughs not the point of playing games?
---
This is just conjecture on your part, really means nothing. I could say the exact same thing about human female rogues and would be completely baseless.
---
Occam's razoring it would suggest that some people like to camp lowbies. That's it.
---
I'm more intrigued why this isn't frowned upon more, especialy on this subreddit.
---
Well I know it's because people only look after their ass at the end despite saying how classic community is what makes the game great and everyone loves eachother and such crap.
---
But still, I thought people would be a bit more inclined to help eachother especialy with the amount of time still left until p2 and nothing else to do until then but run dungeons.
---
Guess we'll just have to wait for this trend to die over when most guilds shape up and actualy start raiding. It'll be a while though.
---
This is why I hate gnomes. Shenanigans.
---
Yeah it sucked as I was hitting 60 that day, in a really nice groove and everything.. and then someone just has to act like a fuckwit over nothing.
---
I'm pretty sure he saw my post in General and came over specifically to swipe it from me (looked to be rep farming the area). Real dick move, I hate how greedy some people are in the game.
---
But such is life, onward and upward!
---
I juat want my Seal of Blood back.

lvl 39 warlock, over 3 days played atm.
---
Problems is that succubus needs to be within range to seduce and its really short which is a huge issue. Another thing is seduce is on shared DR with fear, so once you seduce you automatically reduce the next duration of fear if you manage to get it off. So youre really just using seduce to.. gear a fear off, which, due to DR, is something you dont really want to do, the worst part about it is that you really have nothing else you want to cast due to the fact that any damage will break seduce.  
---
So unless your opener will be soulfire and you expect to 1 shot them. Aint got much use for the succubus. She will be helpful when it comes to 2v1 though because you seduce one, fear the other, she's also the pet youll use vs warriors because if they pop berserker rage to be immune to fear, seduce goes through that.  
---
But honestly the pets that are more helpful is VW/Felhunter.
---
Basic horde right ?
---
Does it make me a bad druid that I refuse to tank instances with my guildies/friends? I wanna heal dammit!
---
My favorite is DPS pulling while I'm waiting for the healer to drink, then getting called out for not waiting for the healer to drink. Fun times.
---
He's a mage main.
---
If you look carefully you can see an armored salamander.
---
No server any more has more than two layers. Some are down to a single layer (AKA no layer). 
---
On my server, at peak times, there just isn't any point in questing. Legit you can have 15 people competing for 10 quest mobs for a quest. I wish there were more layers. At peak hours, I just run dungeons.... Dungeons I don't even need any loot from.
---
I spent two hours trying to kill 10 Panthers in STV the other night, got ganked about 20 times by groups of ally in the mid 40s...Then a 60 Hunter showed up and massacred them--literally running a patrol and going on a murder spree.  It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
---
Lmao, sorry to your friends who have to deal with such toxicity. If I were a rogue I'd pass Ironfoe to a warrior no problem. Fewer of them that will need viskag. It's not about clearing content, it's about optimization and getting through raid faster so we can do other shit. If that's not your playstyle, all good.
---
I don't get upset, good for them if they form that group.
---
I do put people on ignore for ridiculous reserves though.  Most likely someone I wouldn't want to group with going forward.
---
Stuff like, "Need tank/heals and key for UBRS, trustrike/mainhand/offhand on reserve."
---
Snaaaaaaaaaaaaaaake!?!?!?!
---
I'm thinking 8 if they stick to a similar schedule. Can't wait for BFA re-release!
---
That is why I have always been playing on PVE servers ...
---
I thought it was pretty lame originally, but I've come around to it.  It's basically the upfront version of just not being invited because you don't want loot competition.
---
It is unfortunate that warriors have poor AOE agro. Gotta be quick on that tab targeting
---
That‚Äôs to stop people from ninjaing, so I don‚Äôt see how it correlates. And yes if they supply the people who require it, they can reserve it. But you bet your ass ill be mad if eye of divinity drops and you give it to your priest without me having a shot. If you want to reserve loot and have advantages for your guild, run with only your guild. If you can‚Äôt do that you can‚Äôt reserve shit.
---
Won‚Äôt be replying to any straw-man arguments or comments that rely on the fallacious logic that because our global supply chain is intertwined with China, (our phones are made in China! Who knew!?) this means we can‚Äôt make individual choices that, collectively, force change at the system-wide level. Boycotts work, China is a threat to your freedom, and one need not physically be in Hong Kong to shed light on the disturbing trend of American companies capitulating to China‚Äôs demands. See you in Irvine!
---
VanasKOS or Spy is great for that. I love it. I get on the boat to BB and there's a 60 on our team hanging out on the boat. Some horde gets on, I wouldn't remember them, but I get an alert that he ganked me with 2 friends back in Stonetalon. Tell the 60 about it, and the guy dies on the boat.
---
In Stromgarde and we have a big group of Alliance. Some Horde guys try to walk by like they're minding their own business, but wait a minute! These guys were in the group that killed me in Hillsbrad while I was trying to fish! Now they're swimming with the fishes.
---
Acutaly I was an OG vanilla player and they used to reserve stuff on my realm. If it wasn't a normal thing on yours it doesn't mean it wasn't on others. I can clearly remeber ZG pugs reserving enchanting mats for guildis and having no trouble finding people to fill the spots.
---
Which is fine. Cuz I would simply not enchant for you then lol.
---
I never heard about reserved loot in vanilla and I don‚Äôt get why anybody would join such a group. It feels like the paid dlc thing and loot boxes game company‚Äôs are running where it just becomes common and people have to adapt.   
---
I joined a group and 2 min from the dungeon the tank say he deserved all the orbs in Strat Live. I get that his gear is more expensive to repair but it‚Äôs a part of the game and he chose that class.   
---
Only time I would think reserving loot is fair is when there‚Äôs a level difference between players.
---
Yeah but it's boring.
---
Reviving this because this still has not been fixed.
---
According to Thrall, anyway, the Horde and Alliance are officially in a truce as of Classic's point in the timeline.
---
This is comedy at its finest
---
I just finished up everything I needed in Mara this weekend. The dino packs that silence are the most frustrating thing I've encountered while tanking so far in classic because of current dps. You charge them and immediately everybody opens up with AoE. Aggro is of course pulled, which then makes half the group go running for casters. Casters lose aggro as they run out of AoE and aggro goes to healer. Now a group of chain AoE silencing mobs is sitting on the healer in the middle of our casters and I can't taunt because I'm silenced. Nothing is hitting the tank, so no rage to pull aggro off the casters. Everything is a complete mess... and then of course one of the dps goes and pulls a patrol, too, because they weren't paying attention. Now the dino mess that we can mostly deal with because they don't do a ton of damage are joined by a group of rock elementals, which immediately go fuck up the healer because a dps pulled them so the tank never gets aggro on them and has no ability to use AoE skills due to the silence. 
---
I kinda miss when it was mostly just hunters that were stupid and a pain in the ass in groups, because at least they didn't do a ton of AoE aggro and could feign if they pulled. Now it's mages who easily pull AoE aggro and can't drop the aggro once they pull it.
---
You could probs start running level 58-60 dungeons for 58+ level requirement gear. You're still getting good exp while also farming for pre-BiS or BiS items you're going to need to farm once you hit 60 anyway.
---
Desolace, higher parts of Ashenvale, some of Stonetalon Mountains, Hillsbrad, Shimmering Flats in Thousand Needles, early Desolace, or maybe grind Scarlet Monastery? In a few levels you can do Badlands and Arathi too.
---
Highly suggest just doing STV for a while though. It‚Äôs one of the faster zones in the game for leveling.
---
Even if that were true, that would be enough.
---
This shot made me fucking laugh hard man.. 
---
Looks similar both ways too so he‚Äôs probably super fucked ü§£
---
That doesn't make it faster lol
---
I can't address all the problems of world in a single comment. ;P
---
if that is true then it tells you who is the good guys and who is the good guys.
---
Because they're routinely trying to reserve more stuff than anyone on retail has ever seen, even going back to Vanilla.
---
It's like the etiquette and reasonable expectations have been reset to a blank slate.
---
Because it's pretty standard for PuG raid leaders to reserve some mats so they can make gold for their effort or the tank taking first Crusader Orb in Live Strat they think there are no limits.
---
Then on the other side there are people just not accustomed to pretty standard reserves and will rage against anything reserved.
---
I try to never attack taurens, I never want to kill taurens. And it disappoints me when a fellow tauren druid fishts me.
---
Don't forget the master racial that is shadowmeld.
---
Use the Lookingforgroup channel 
---
/join lookingforgroup
---
That‚Äôs the official channel. You can also look in the dungeon general chat. For example go to the instance and look for groups in general. Some people just sit around the dungeon and only level in the dungeons
---
24 warrior, 18 mage and 17 rogue.
---
I agree. The reserve thing was not much of an issue during vanilla. Sure, people were hesitant to invite classes needing similar loot, but if you were invited you typically had a right to role.
---
Never had this much reserving back in the day.
---
This is morbidity at its heaviest
---
56
---
Problem is that not only are they going to be geared out as fuck by p2, they're organized. Even though there are more horde they'll nerd way more people to wipe a full APES raid. Sort of like level 45s killing a 60. Yes it's possible, but you typically need 2-3 to manage it thanks to the gear difference.
---
I'm stealing this haha
---
If someone's reserving too much, roast them.
---
Then don't fucking post it on reddit, your work is done.
---
Different guilds raid on different nights, genius. On most servers, every night will be someone's "raid night."
---
Sword spec is not recommended for leveling as combat anyway. Probably for this reason (you still get +5 weapon skill to swords and daggers though). 
---
So generally having a dagger in the OH is fine while leveling.
---
Perception is gaaaarbage, take it from me. It's a mediocre bonus even in the unlikely situation that you use it *before* you get opened on.
---
How can they live to regret it when they're already undead?
---
I'm in line with if its red it's dead regardless of level unless they do something to entertain me and then I shall use them for bait. I sat the ashenvale horde FP with my pocket healer and we kept one tauren shaman around 22 alive while murdering every green skin shit mouth and creepy crawly that walked our way. It took roughly 45 minutes for a level 60 shaman to show up just for him to get bopped and camped like his friends. By far my favorite world pvp spot
---
&gt; they're the underdogs.
---
Except they're not lol
---
As long as there is a valid melee path you can avoid guards range
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs like 118% with all of them
---
It's rude, and not something most people do; if you invite someone to a group you should never kick them for a guildy. 
---
But it happens.
---
Not to mention [flame reflector trinket](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18638/hyper-radiant-flame-reflector)
---
I've used both grid and elvui to make my healing frames. Unit frames are a big deal for healing : you want as little info as possible : only what you need to know, and you want health to be easy to read so you can see them in the corner of your eyes or at a glance.
---
Something close to my ideal : https://i.imgur.com/2xrjf7y.png simple and easy to read. The squares stand for my hots (the character was a druid) and the screenshot was taken in wotlk where druids had a lot of em. Of course in vanilla not only do healers have much less effects to keep track of (especially shaman), but there's also not much incentive to use anything more than big slow mana efficient spells for healing, but anyway. Rejuv, regrowth, power word shield (and its debuff), still nice to track for those classes.
---
Here's another example : https://i.imgur.com/hOegdq7.png this is a test frame but it's still good enough to explain my philosophy. The top row of icons on the left is for debuffs. I want to know if someone has mortal wounds for example, but I don't care about whether or not they're hamstringed (at least, in pve). The second row of icons is for buffs. I want to know if someone is invincible, for example (iceblock, bubble), or if they're taking less damage because of a defensive cooldown (evasion, shield wall), but I don't care whether or not they have blessing of kings etc...
---
So I display buffs and debuffs, but only a few (shouldn't need more than 4 debuffs and 4 buffs), and only those that I want to know about. Finally, you want to know who has the aggro, indicated for example by a red border around the frame, who's too far away from your heals (frame faded out) and also ideally you want absorbs reflected on the health bars (no need to prioritize a mage who's half hp but has his full ice barrier up, yknow ?) though I'm not sure if this is doable in classic.
---
That's about everything on frames. Grid2 / ElvUI can make those kinds of frames easily, but you'll have to spend time setting them up and perfecting them. Last important thing is not having to target anything. I simply use mouseover macros like this "/cast [@mouseover,help][@player] Flash Heal" it casts the spell on mouseover, and if you're not mousing over a friendly target it autocasts on yourself. You will love not having to click anymore. There's an addon called Clique that allows binding mouse clicks for heals, I don't personally use it but it could be useful to you.
---
That's about it for UI. Here's some more advice related to your gameplay. Know which of your spells have the best hps (heal per second) versus the best hpm (heal per mana) - one is useful to keep people alive through big constant damage, the other is useful for healing small damage and saving mana. Note that to maximize hpm, you often want to downrank your spells - that's because different ranks have different bonus heal coefficients that don't always match the mana cost linearly. You can probably find the coefficients for your class somewhere and do your own calculations - I don't know of any addon that does that for you but I'd sure like to find one. You also want to know when to precast : when to expect a big burst of damage that needs to be healed as quickly as possible, hence the need for preparing a heal preemptively. You want to know when to expect big constant damage on everyone : that's when you use your cooldowns and your biggest hps heals and you should make sure you have the mana before it happens. You want to minimize overhealing, and that's going to partly depend on your coordination with other healers in your raid, and you want to know which spell to use for panic heals, which is when somebody is in danger of imminent death and needs a heal as quickly as possible - a big slow heal won't cut it if he takes damage before the cast completes, so you can sacrifice hps and hpm just to keep em alive. Finally as a shaman since you'll be using chain heal a lot, you might want to display ally nameplates and pay attention to your surroundings.
---
Keep in mind that's general advice, taken from my healing experience in wotlk/legion. I have never healed in vanilla, and from what I understand, healing in vanilla is a bit simpler. There aren't a lot of tools, cooldowns, and types of incoming damage aren't that varied due to boss tactics being simpler. So as I understand it, it's more a matter of not running out of mana (so hpm is really important), and it's also more reactive healing than pre-emptive healing, since hots aren't really that useful.
---
Anyway, that's it. Shit, big post. I may have overdone it this time. Just throw a reply if anything I said is confusing.
---
This is about 99% of horde tatics
---
Arcane is a support tree. Your main damaging spells are never arcane. You spec arcane to improve your frost damaging spells.
---
Grobbulus is 50:50
---
Meh, not really. They stay in BGs because they‚Äôre usually on the smaller faction. Not sure where this idea comes from.
---
Nothing otherwise you risk the game becoming another retail.
---
Typically I just smack them with whatever stat stick I'm using at the time. I actually use dungeons to train my weapon skills lmao. If I'm actually trying to dps I'll toss out some faerie fires and maybe a moonfire or two. Wrath is just too mana intensive to spam for more than a couple spells.
---
Based. Fuck gnomes
---
google basically does this for you.
---
Lvl ?? Dwarf paladin was killing everyone at Nessingwary Camp. Now i usually avoid this, but i had 7 pages to hand in.
---
Arrive and ofcourse instantly attacks, pop shieldblock and disarms just to survive. Well that seemed all the other ganked horde need to come rushing in.. 7 lvl 30+ against one lvl 50+.
---
Took 4minutes and a lot of kiting but we got her down!
---
I like the live/let live rule. But i have been betrayed too many times to trust rogues to honor  this.
---
This was entertaining and the sad truth.
---
Exactly. Both options are better than you being invited then having the item ninja‚Äôd from you.
---
What does that even mean?
---
Arcane is a good early leveling spec. Improved missiles get no pushback.
---
That's why wowhead is still king.  It's the comment section that matters.
---
You‚Äôre the worst kind of person.
---
That's the circle of gank
---
That's just silly. Our guild has 5 split mc raids running right now in gehenas and we started a week later than those monkeys. What makes apes special or overly popular is that most of them stream. Still there's no huge difference in gear wise. They might have farmed more consumables tho and are better prepared
---
You said
---
&gt;There might be two layers on the High servers but Full like Skeram have more than two depending on player count in the zone.
---
Which is incorrect, as proven by the linked blue post.
---
It's not that people "want" your post to be wrong. It just is.
---
well, the thing is a game as big as WoW, even if a trivial 1 percent leave, that's a lot of people for a private server, many of which have a total pop under 1000.     But what got me thinking about private servers was the unusual situation of a group of people stopping playing but not because they were done or bored, and so I wonder if they aren't ripe for the Private Servers.
---
Huurr durrr imma paladin
---
Don‚Äôt thank me, thank the brave heroes who died so I would have the freedom to write it, and you the freedom to attempt a glib response.
---
Iirc the top speed clearing guilds are horde for WF and lust
---
It'll be 1:1 in these cases, and GRINDS are going to want to farm honor too. Which sounds better? Fighting against an equally geared and skilled raid, or smashing helpless pugs that can't do more than wave a stick in your direction?
---
That‚Äôs why you make friends or join a good guild. Interacting with people is part of an online game.
---
Love that ping ping pin sound
---
Mining boner here!
---
If I‚Äôm getting camped more than 1-2 rezzes I‚Äôm just gonna hit the spirit healer and make an auction run. I‚Äôm in no rush to 60 and found that going out and doing other things in the world (first aid, gathering, quests that take you flying all over, etc) can be as enjoyable as questing if you adjust your expectations. If you‚Äôre in a rush it‚Äôs probablh gonna keep being frustrating but there‚Äôs a lot to be enjoyed off to the side of the straight-to-60 path.
---
so guttriper main hand and another off hand?
---
Honestly this is quite normal. I'd be inclined to take it if I'm looking for a specific item.
---
Pretty much
---
I gave up on the oce gaming Community after seeing what oce league of legends became, the og Lol Australia clan / community was so very wholesome, Ghaan, Yons and SiKiN did a great job with that, then we ended up with this atrocity...
---
RAAAAAAGE
---
Exactly, preventative ganking. If rouges can't level then there will be no rogues to gank us.
---
That enchant to top it all off...
---
If you're a competent tank, join a competent guild and do runs with guildies who won't play like dummies. Pug runs straight suck 99% of the time, and any sensible guild would enjoy a tank willing to run stuff so you're stressing yourself by choice.
---
That feel when you turn em all in and look at your xp bar explode...
---
Better than sex!!
---
Ret Paladin on Pagle already had it. &gt;_&gt;
---
BGs will be cross realm, most likely battlegroups. They haven't been announced so picking a single server that you like might help but you will battle with and against other servers too.
---
Is that a wireless version?
---
That's the only way the horde play. In groups and focus underleveled players questing.
---
With optimal conditions and skill, yes. On a crowded PVP server, rarely.
---
I'm a druid but not 60 yet, is FF not one of the debuffs you'd want on boss regardless if dps/tank/heal?
---
I don't know if you needed to pick Faerlina to get that though.  Any of the still layered servers work.
---
Population wise there are several bigger factions due to imbalances on the server.  Herod, Incendius, Whitemane, Pagle.
---
Pagle had almost 30k more alliance.
---
I avoided Faerlina because I didn't want to deal with the streamers.
---
Dot ticks don't do anything to prevent the kited mob from leashing. That is typically done with rank 1 arcane shot.
---
I love enhance too, but the way classic is balanced, I believe you‚Äôll have a much more enjoyable experience going elemental at 60.
---
However, MC and Ony are easy enough that 40mans probably won‚Äôt be difficult to get in.
---
You‚Äôll probably have a harder time getting into the 60 dungeons than raids.
---
Obviously, it's really good when you know, or expect, to have a rogue around.
---
aka bgs, or even if you already saw a rogue
---
facts=/=bait
---
People think apes are skilled because they managed to amass most no lifers who have shit tons of time, every guild has a few of these types of players, they're not skilled, just dedicated.
---
XD
---
:OoooooOooOooOoO getting it rn
---
i'm new to this, but couldn't he be 30% right and 70% left? wouldn't that make him left AND right? why you tryna put him in the dirt so hard :p
---
Too many tanks don't listen. Like when I tell them not to sit at the base of the stairs at Zul'Farrack. Then they blame me to being out of mana even though I've been chugging mana potions on cooldown.
---
&gt; A 60 fighting a 60 can be as unfair as a 60 fighting a 20 depending on the classes involved
---
Definitely not true lmao
---
Appreciate the information/reply! I have been using ElvUI but I'm not a fan of the aesthetics overall. It does include several helpful Addons, but the visual layout is not to my liking. I believe I'll try Lorti UI out with the addition of BronzeDragonFrame, just because I enjoy the added flair. Hopefully Lorti is compatible with BronzeDragonFrame, as I believe that would add a simple, but visually pleasing aesthetic. May the RNG Gods smile upon your journey through Classic!
---
my fault.  I didn't know to put a 'flair' on it.  Mods were kind enough to let me know and show me how, should be on there now.
---
I enjoy pvp, I really do. 
---
But if I'm being honest, fights that are actually fair are incredibly, incredibly rare. I have a 48 rogue and a 37 lock in Classic and between the 2 of them I've only ever been in 2 fights I would consider fair. (I lost one and won one, both fair and square.) The vast, vast majority of "world pvp" is ganking, either through player numbers or level or both. I don't really remember it being so skewed toward ganking in vanilla, but I think the extreme concentration of players all being the same level/in the same zones has a lot to do with it. If you're in the minority faction on a pvp realm it's basically just an extra few dozen or so hours tacked on to your leveling time with all the times you'll be bullied by other players with nothing you can do about it (aside from stop playing.)
---
That‚Äôs not true. I run all the level 60 dungeons with a shaman tank all the time.  They just need to have the gear for it and know what they are doing.
---
No, not even a little.
---
Nobody fucking cares. Not even a tiny bit.

Because in games modifiers are used a lot more than they are in typing. My main bar in WoW is 123456QZXCE`. My second bar is SHIFT+123456QZXCE`. My fifth bar is CTRL+123456QZXCE`. A lot of the time I want to be casting those as I strafe and move around.
---
With Pinky modifier, ring A, middle W, index D I can comfortably press CTRL+4 while still having complete control over WAS and never repositioning my hand. The only one that really sucks is ` with a modifier.
---
With hands at the typing position, it's a very uncomfortable reach to press CTRL + anything. Even with shift, anything left of 4 is uncomfortable and would make me take my hands off of all movement except D, but even most of the keys on that side would make me reposition my hand entirely.
---
Not saying any of these micro-optimizations will every actually amount to anything in 99.999% off playtime, but that's why more people probably don't switch off from the classic "gaming" finger positioning.
---
SJWs did you wrong, friend. Whoever told you western democracy isn‚Äôt fundamentally superior to totalitarian fascism was mistaken. We are the better civilization, full stop. I suggest you talk to some people in HK or Singapore if you‚Äôre curious about what they actually think. Britain voluntarily ceded control of HK to China, and that was the beginning of the end for their freedoms. They don‚Äôt want to be a colony, obviously, but it‚Äôs widely agreed upon that the British pedigree is a key factor in these states‚Äô prosperity. Same goes for Kenya, one of the only upwardly mobile and prosperous countries in Africa.

Kill everything, regardless of level.

As long as only one mage has winter's chill, every mage can chose the frost spec he likes. However going full arcane and rest frost gives best mana/dps coefficient.
---
lol as a night elf i'm gonna try this
---
Maybe he was trying to right click his bobber and...
---
You do realize this isnt faction specific right? There are assholes on both sides of the coin. The mental logic that one faction is worse than the other has gotta be the stupidest shit ive seen in all these threads.
---
You seem to care alot about your fantasy of nobody caring. That a nice thought for you?
---
Oh. Mermaid man and barnacle boy gotcha. I was like wtf is a mermaid man-voice.  Read it wrong.
---
OP seems to be the only person getting mad. And it's juvenile activism at best, so...
---
Consider 123456QZXCE\`
---
You sound salty.
---
&gt; Blizzard makes some of the best games out, kinda hard to stop playing them
---
That hasn't been true for a long time.
---
Someday my Darkshore list will look like that. Someday...
---
How does this "shit up the sub" when the front page is full of fan art and memes? lol
---
Well yes, but on bosses you're typically spending more time healing. I mean on the trash packs where you usually have more downtime.
---
I meant F as a hot key. Still using WADS. And also V as a hot key for thumb. 
---
   
---
F and G are usually default keys in shooters for grenade. Makes sense to use them for a hot key in mmorpgs too. 
---
I actually did try what you are saying several years back. It allows pinky to reach Q, A, Z for hotkeys. W RT Y GH CVB are easily reachable. While using Shift as a modifier is a great setup
---
Ingame calender to support planning events with the guild without external help.
---
Thats all for me.
---
That is really just your opinion.
---
no one said it is, dipshit
---
For the most part, they're fighting other twinked out characters.
---
That *is* world PvP. If you don't want to be ganked, don't play on a PvP server. I've never played on a PvP server and I find complaints like this hilarious.
---
Yeah, as a fresh healer I did the same thing. Wanna know what I did? I got better.
---
Of course, and happy grinding!
---
Vanilla loot systems working as intended. Spread the word, tarnish his reputation, tarnish his guilds reputation.
---
Don't use 'lol' as punctuation.
---
And nobody needs to see this garbage.
---
What a pathetic subreddit. Just upvote our emotions and leave reality out of it
---
Blame it on the ADD aoe spam everything mentality brought on by years of dumbed down retail WoW.
---
Retail is so shit easy (at least it was the last time i played back at draenor release) that everyone can just run in and roll their face across the keyboad to win.
---
Classic/vanilla is just not like that(mostly). 
---
You have to use CC and target priority sometimes, or you are gonna get rekt.
---
Tanks and healers just do not have the same tools to make up for spam happy dps as they do in retail.
---
The general populace just does not have the patience or skill set for that kind of game anymore.
---
This, in part, is why i will not be tanking or healing this time around.
---
Right now do Tanaris, and Feralas, Then start looking st Blasted Lands and Searing Gorge then move on to Ungoro and Felwood
---
By that point they may have transfers though.
---
Damn so salty.  lol
---
43 rogue but i took 2 weeks off
---
Indeed, your statement is equal to itself. That‚Äôs what we call a tautology! I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll be learning all about them once you get into the advanced courses at ITT Tech.
---
I guarentee he came back and just adjusted his direction slightly to keep himself on the path, unbeknownst to him he's running the wrong way. It's not until he walks into Darnassus that he realize something's up
---
Thank you! I‚Äôll give that route a shot
---
&gt;  Anyone who demands to have a ‚Äúreal‚Äù healer before the 45-55 range is just spoiled. I can open a bottle with a spoon. Is it ideal? No, but it does get the bottle open.
---
&amp;nbsp; 
---
You disagree with this part? Maybe it‚Äôs a slight oversight on your part because you did mention anything before 45 is irrelevant, but I did say *before* 45-55. If you‚Äôre demanding to only get healed by a resto Druid or holy play in DM or literally ANY of the Scarlet Monasteries, you‚Äôre severely restricting the pool of people you can play with. My argument is that you don‚Äôt have to be specced to heal in order to heal dungeons pre-45. But beyond that I would feel skeptical about bringing off spec healers into a dungeon with me. I‚Äôm not even talking about leveling using a healing spec. I‚Äôve leveled a holy priest. It‚Äôs like playing a shitty mage, but it‚Äôs fully doable. I would even say it‚Äôs quite enjoyable, in the same way it‚Äôs enjoyable to watch a tortoise cross a line you made in the sand. And I mean that genuinely. Fucking love turtles.
---
But it's a pve server though lol
---
You don't even need a tank til ~ZF or so.
---
We did 3 shaman, 1 hunter, 1 mage Cath and it went super smooth.
---
Have to actually be an OK player though... Which I guess feeds back into the issue.
---
Well I mean how boring would a video of corpse camping be to watch? No shit they dont include it
---
Yeah freedom‚Äôs for suckers, right?
---
I'm not as experienced as you (my priest is 37) but man I really disagree with your 3rd paragraph.  DPS just kills things faster, but tanks and healers prevent wipes.  If things are crazy I make sure that a) I stay alive b) the tank stays alive and c) the dps stays alive.
---
Muphrey's Law.
---
He looks like the dastardly villain in a kids cartoon show.
---
I'm tired of people saying tanks get blamed for everything. 
---
Every. Single. Dungeon. I have ever been in. No one has flamed the tank, not even once.
---
Alliance really is something special, they can't see a low level horde without attacking and the horde was probably trying to help him
---
I cant imagine anything more pathetic than whining about getting ganked on a PvP server
---
Everyone wants the mount, or at least most people do, and there is nothing that gives anyone more entitlement to it than anyone else. If you think you deserve it more than anyone else, that's probably a sign you have your head up your arse. 
---
If it were anything that influenced gameplay and there were legitimate reasons to prioritize it, sure, none of those reasons exist here however.
---
This is such a load of sanitized corporate horseshit and doublespeak. How dumb do they think their customers are, and why is it so hard to just admit that their actions have everything to do with their vested financial interests in China (and nothing to do with some meaningless "company values" jargon)?
---

---
Does a bidder go home with gold? I feel as if you join this raid get carried and buy loot, that‚Äôs your reward. 
---
If I am understanding this correctly, you could buy an item for let‚Äôs say 250g, and then get traded 100g at the end of the night, meaning you only spent 150g, and also didn‚Äôt contribute to the boss kills.
---
I dunno who told you that but warlocks are essental for raids. It will take longer to find groups as dps but not impossible. Tank and healers have alot more responsibility. I had a 60 lock in vanilla i loved it, if youre enjoying it stick with it.
---
Nothing against ganking, I do plenty of ganking, but PvP is a lot more exciting when you're fighting a fair fight. Because then it's really a test of who is playing their class better rather than who has a higher character level or stronger equipment. You actually get to make use of your full kit instead of just pressing F once to delete the low level player
---
Yesterday I was grinding timbermaw rep when an underleveled paladin showed up as I was about to pull the named one. Only reason he'd be in the area underleveled would be if he had the quest to kill it, so I communicated with emotes and then pulled the surrounding ones, making sure he could tag the chieftain before I attacked it, too.
---
Sure, that mob was worth bonus rep. Sure, helping the paladin set me back on my grind. But it felt good, and maybe he'll pay it forward down the line.
---
Don't paint us all with the same brush.
---
No SJWs friend. So you are pro-West. Britain voluntarily ceded control of a colony in 1997(ish)...after they claimed all colonies were entitled to self determination and eventual freedom in the 40's. If you want the British Empire part 2, that's your thing. I hope your tribalism doesn't lead you into darkness. No civilizations are better than others. Much like how I am no better than you. Can you beat me up and take my money (resources), sure. Can you subject me to subhuman status, sure. Can you create a false narrative to justify intervention into foreign affairs, sure. Does not make someone or something better. This b.s. is not the path to walking the earth as brothers and sisters. Your ethnocentrism is in fact a facist trait. Not saying you're a racist but how can you knock a percieved fascist if your argument is made on fascist pretenses? 
---
I am by no means defending this company or any company. Am I financial supporting their decisions to some degree, yes. Much like how I pay taxes for a government to commit whatever crimes they can justify and spin as Democracy. Am I going to stop paying taxes? No, unfortunately lol. Will I stop playing a game because the company is doing something "shady" (debatable), no. Which companies are pure? Please tell us all so we can be vigilant. You can apply this to any industry and it'll lead to the same answer. Good on you for picking and choosing your "battles" though. However, unless there's an entire systematic overhaul, [Insert Company Name] will be the same as the next. 
---
Also, Western Democracy is a shame of what democracy is. How can you not see that? Totalitarian fascism is not what China is and you know that. Using inflammatory language will not help you. Please stop regurgitating Breitbart garbage. Or Infowars, whichever crazy fascist you're listening to.
---
They're not, they've already said that this was an intentional decision.
---
"Made" some of the best games, hence why were playing a game from 15 years ago.
---
What you wear doesn‚Äôt correlate 1:1 with your wardrobe and even less so with your online persona. Quit throwing your opinions around like fact. If this thread was to be believed the WoW community on reddit figured out a dozen or more universal truths.  
---
Even if your ludicrous statement was true, it assumes that people who like undead must also like ganking.  Where exactly does that broad generalization come from? Same with your examples.  So what does a person dressing punk say? That they must like u dead and therefore ganking? Or a ‚Äúweeb‚Äù? Do they have to pick the most anime race because it fits your generalization? No, it says at best, what they find interesting as fashion or as a show of their interests.  
---
Its you who is out of his mind. Did you think that through at all beyond the surface, considering how sure you sound? But let me guess, downvote, insult and move on feeing like you ‚Äúsure showed him‚Äù?
---
I hit 60 pretty fast. Then I did /who hunter 60 to see like 12 other tryhards had reached 60. Then I did /who priest 60 and saw 22 people in 60.  
---
More priests than hunters at fast 60. Just take that in.
---
Yea true, i have to outskill those alliance that one shot me
---
Fire also requires better gear than frost
---
What realm is this?
---
It is wpvp tho
---
Yeah because every sane low level player gets stomped once and then stops dealing with this unfair bullshit.
---
When every tank is practically in a union where this is the only way you‚Äôll find a tank it‚Äôs a little annoying. I get it though.
---
Yesterday i got ganked up by 2 ali players while i was afk
---
Warlocks are one of the most versatile classes you can play. Whoever said you will struggle finding a group really doesn't understand how useful a warlock is and thankfully will be in the minority.
---
It depends on what your guild is pugging and how many.  Also depends on if chat has had it with people's shit that day.  .
---
Raid guilds pugging most of the raid and not bringing anything of importance then reserving stuff is going to get annoying.
---
Tbh I discriminate, I only gank gnomes.
---
That's what you're supposed to do, bro
---
Wait till you have death coil, it gets even better
---
Tanking at 54 might be a little rough depending on how far your group goes in the dungeon. I just finished out as many quests as I could in Felwood, Winterspring, WPL/EPL, etc. until the high 50's and then jumped into the BRD spam.
---
I did about 10 runs on Sunday, with a 5 man group. Lost it twice, after which nobody needed it anymore and it didn't drop for 5 runs. I'm not destined to get it.
---
Yeah at the start of classic. Stuff like that is no longer upvoted anymore
---
A DPS warrior that exclusively deals DPS while refusing to tank from time to time is selfish.
---
A DPS warrior that only tanks if he can lock "All orbs" (aka free 80g), two blues and one epic and so on is selfish.
---
A DPS warrior that wants to go in a 5-man instance and lets his group search for a tank for two hours instead of just strapping on a shield for something (instance and loot) that he wants  hisself too is selfish.
---
I can understand someone that ran an instance 40 times without seeing or winning a quite common blue item reserving it (aka searching for group members that do not need that item) and tolerate it - but sorry, no, DPS warriors do not have the right to lock 80 gold or four items just because they can't bloat their self-esteem with damage meters for *one* time just because they need several items.
---
lol.
---
Me too!!
---
Nice day for fishing ain't it!
---
The early ungoro quests - with mobs in NE corner of map - are all around 48-49 too
---
Do you have any plan on how to deal with the massive queues we still have (on EU it's usually around 1-2 hours)?
---
It's millennial thing; they think they're all diamonds.
---
Assuming something about a person you know nothing about is a shitty fucking fail of an argument. Using fifty cent words to sound smart while making those ignorant assumptions makes it worse.
---
Again: Nobody fucking cares that you're a hypocrite.

Life on a pvp server. If you don't like it, you can do what I did and roll pve.

Their Will be Massive ganking when phase2 hits
---
Oooo, neat. Got some coords to share? :)
---
That's default. So a lot of people
---
Wand isnt really that essential as a mage. I usually wand when Mob is very close to death and I want to start my regen or when im completely oom. Something you learn as you play my guy
---
Improved cleave is a noob trap if you read the tool tip you'll notice the 120 % increase is not to cleave overall this would be insane its to the BONUS damage. The bonus damage on the final rank of cleave is 50 120% of 50 is 60. For 3 talent points you gain 60 damage on your cleave hits which while isn't nothing there are far better places to put your talent points.  
---
Sweeping strikes is insanely high damage can can't be matched in aoe by fury.
---
Ah yes, STV. Where a level 60 gnome rogue corpse-camped me and 2 other horde players while we were doing that ogre killquest next to Grom'gol.
---
true.
---
And?
---
Noticed  theres a lack of tanks, respect my Paladin from holy/prot to prot/holy and decide to do some tanking. Have a good chunk of gear for tanking, quickly find out where there's a lack of tanks. DPS seriously have no clue what threat is, Mages cone of colding right away thinking 1 tick of consecrate is going to hold threat.
---
I've not been ganked as much anywhere else. Honestly hilarious how many 30+ alliance players killed my level 20 ass.
---
You don't think theres more kids on the horde side?
---
Relevant username
---
ignore the warning and check load out of date addons, it works fine.
---
You are just a edgy shithead
---
I‚Äôve tanked non stop since lvl 34 to lvl 53 and I‚Äôve never had anybody show any negativity towards me.  Talking about probably 150+ runs. 
---
Hunters on the other hand I‚Äôve found, completely upholding their stereotype.  If there‚Äôs a jackass in the group it‚Äôs almost been exclusively a hunter.
---
gnomes are 3/5th of a person
---
Id post it in the discord/reddit associated with the server. Scum needs to be named and shamed
---
This is on the south shore of Durotar, west of Sen'jin village. It's the hut of the fishing trainer. You're looking south-east toward echo isles.
---
the best is when the gl's friends and or officers are warriors so you give them massive epeen with your wf+ tranquil air and thats all you need to do.
---
Northwestern stranglethorn. It's where all the ZG quest givers are.
---
God I fucking hate gnomes. I swear every single one of them is a huge piece of shit, at least on my server.
---
Yeah I only attack people if, 1) they are alliance and 2) are not grey.
---
Not sure about quests but I suggest you grind a level or two in the Shimmering Flats. The basilisk pool area down south near the road to Gadgetzan is where I did it. They're lv35/36 and if you can kill em with minimal downtime that 1-2 level grind for grays should almost ensure you get to 90g by 40.
---
True, it all depends on how the DKP is obtained. Theres many ways to abuse the DKP like rewarding extra to people for farming something. Some inner circle could pool the guy items and make it seem like he donated alot, or sometimes forgive some1 for being late and others not.
---
Also calling raids at random times, then only the inner circle can attend like during normal working hours etc
---
Keybindings
---
it is a waste of time, yours and theirs
---
Because retail wow is dying.
---
Lust not there in classic pretty sure
---
i just use msbt and have it modified to only show when an opponent dodges one of my attacks/abilities to play a sound. works fine in any stance as it is dependent on just enemy dodges
---
You forgot FS
---
I switched from warrior to shaman cause everyone treated me like shit.
---
Everyone would just pull and then ask why I wasn't pulling. rogues would just walk up to groups and expect me to get aggro on all of them.
---
Then they would straight up make fun of me. it was really demoralizing so I switched to shaman even though I've literally never played one before
---
being a warrior is hard enough without random people talking crap
---
If anyone is not willing to group for Kill quests they are just selfish and stupid. Those 10 people could be 2 groups and cut down the competition drastically. 
---
Now, for drop stuff, I understand, and for those layering is very practical if servers are that full.
---
An argument can be made for +HP too I think
---
Hulkthang reporting in
---
You haven't played Stratholme yet?
---
How did you manage to craft such a stupid comment ?
---
Both systems have their drama, but I prefer loot council myself after experiencing both several times.
---
DKP systems have several issues:
---
* Something about it being a point system leads to people feeling justified with shitty behavior because it's within the rules.
---
* Someone has access to edit the values, often more than one person, and there are definitely occasions where people give themselves more dkp, remove items from several weeks ago, etc. And there's room to get really clever with it to make it hard to catch. Or just, you know, human error and they fucked up. And, of course, also leads to people being wrongly suspicious that values were edited because they wrongly remember DKP values for themselves/someone being different last night and not matching up with what they would expect.
---
* Non zero-sum systems have the issue that new recruits struggle to catch up. Zero-sum systems have the opposite issue where the guild veterans get upset that Johnny NewGuy is on a level playing field with them immediately after they get an item, despite them having done far more work than Johnny NewGuy to get the guild to where they're at now.
---
Loot council issues:
---
* Sometimes the loot council itself is just a group of friends funneling loot to their clique. Easy to spot, find a new guild.
---
* Cliques can develop that get upset for X reason when loot doesn't go to who they thought it should have gone to. They then threaten to quit as a group, which the guild usually can't afford, unless 'fairness' is achieved. Counter-cliques develop, guild drama ensues.
---
* People are flawed and your loot council can have biases. Maybe your class/spec sucks, so you're denied loot. You haven't raided with the guild as long as SeniorMember. Etc.
---
Ultimately, I think the strongest reason to do loot council in retail is because it generally does away with the concept of *"I deserve a fair share of loot"* in favor of *"This is the guild's loot, and we give it to whoever will make the guild benefit most from it."* This is also explains why dkp systems were common in Vanilla/BC but have died out over time to now - guild's are just more successful long-term with loot councils.
---
That said, the raiding culture is really different between classic and retail. You're still going to need gear for future gear-checks in classic, but I also think the community is a lot less focused on min/maxing their raiding too. Still feel like the more successful guilds are going to be loot council though.
---
Hearthstone and crafting professions on action bars?
---
Must be fckn nice. On my Warlock I'm already out of spots on my bars for key bound spells.
---
cept folks are capped out currently and theyve been killing rag since day five.  different culture, old game.
---

&gt;backdoor to our leader
---
Wtf, but they have SHIT LOADS of elite guards!! Alliance leaders get 55 trash pulls. Shit, horde settlements are better protected than our leaders!
---
 **glory of the Alliance!**  my ass. I was leveling at Tanaris when got ganked on low health by horde mage. Then i returned i fought him back, some stray rogue also helped. Then this mage brings his 60lvl rogue friend who corpse camped me for 15 mins. Now thats some zug zug here
---
bro there's no honor in the game
---
U ok?
---
the people on pvp servers ruin pvp
---
I'd consider that a Neutral flight path. Also the Duskwood flight path is closer to the starting area of STV than the booty bay one, which the starting one is more important to be because that's when you're low level and not able to run across the whole zone easily by yourself without horde ganking you. Once a higher level they don't gank as often
---
Looks like Luna Unit Frames
---
heavily depends on the server, not sure how it's possible for so many people to not understand this
---
He used "lol" to show that he wasn't aggressively looking for confrontation.  It was not being used as punctuation.  Lol
---
That's probably more suitable for a closed bid auction with DKP. There's no incentive to minimize gold spent since everyone except for the winner benefits more
---
Troll post confirmed.  
---
But actually was this a troll post because I didn't read any of it.
---
Imagine ninjaing items when you can clear raid in grey Gear LUL
---
No1 left from our guild.. also no discussion about this in realm general chat.  So nothing really changed.
---
Becsuse there is a lot more gold these days
---
It's where you went after zg raid to upgrade rep items from blues to epics and where you returned trash loot for rep increase.
---
Well reserving without advertising is an asshole move.
---
Tanks can reserve orbs in strath because tanks in strath are too rare. If you dont give them their payment you just wont find any. 
---
Other reserve runs, it depends on the item. Why would I care whether someone reserves HoJ, I'm a healer, I dont need it. 
---
The essential thing on an reserve is, if I only need a singular item. I will not run that dungeon 20 times to have it rolled away under my ass. Our tank ran 60 princess runs until he got his ring.
---
coulda drowned your ass /favepalm
---
Skud ud
---
That's my preferred method for mc. For tier gear just have everyone roll at start and you have a list then go down the list. Other gear just roll 1 win per person. Easy, fair, and most importantly fast.
---
Imagine thinking he's a good player
---
I always loved those islands haha
---
I stopped enjoying Warrior because of this. I'm sorry it's been 15 years since I've even seen this dungeon. I don't immediately know the way all the time. And if you don't want to get attacked, then maybe don't pull with AoEs before I hit something. I got to a point where I just started saying that if they didn't like it they can spend the next 20 minutes looking for a different tank. Often I end up making that decision for them by leaving. But just because I have the option doesn't mean I enjoy it. Despite how popular it is in WoW, I don't actually like having to be an asshhole.
---
The community in World of Warcraft makes OverWatch seem friendly. This was a problem even 15 years ago. World of Warcraft keeps the honor, of the worst community of ever seen in any game. Well technically there are games with worse communities, World of Warcraft wins due to the fact the bad community impacts gameplay more.
---
The story behind that is so beautiful.
---
"Fuck I'm sick of getting ganked like this, I'll just take the damn rez sickness. If they can gank me, I can gank them. Lowbies beware."
---
*3 minutes later*
---
*/cry*
---
Imagine complaining about pvp after picking a pvp server üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I agree with the Duskwood flight path.  However, the Booty Bay flight path may be into a neutral city, but it is divided into strictly horde and alliance flight masters. I don‚Äôt think you can disregard that as not being an alliance flight path. 
---
Though, I would agree the Horde has more infrastructure in STV overall.
---
There has been a few times a tank caused multiple wipes in the group and no one said anything because having a bad tank is better than LF1M tank.
---
Those guards were added around Thrall because he didn‚Äôt have any earlier in vanilla and alliance could run through the least populated part of ogrimmar to stomp him in less than 2 minutes.  Even with them a 40 raid will finish him before anyone gets back there, and they do, quite a few times since classic launch.  
---
And no, horde guards were never fixed, they spawn at max 45-55 non-elite in quite a few horde towns.
---
This is sad. Some people just use proper grammar and have large vocabularies because they are educated and verbally gifted. None of the words I used are rare above the high-school level. I have no desire to sound smart on reddit, lol. I shared this for antiquity, and responded to some comments because I enjoy debate and spectacle, and saw some opportunities to educate and deride. I specifically said I am going to make positive change in the real world, and I‚Äôm glad that dropping Blizzard games from my life will give me the opportunity to more rigorously pursue that goal.
---
If they just got good it wouldnt be a problem. I bet your some salty level 30 who cant play getting 1 shot by mages. L2P /s
---
Lots of night shift workers, too.
---
Inside raids. It is silence. Outside raids, a lot of people are casually chatting.
---
Just keep asking questions, you'll understand it all in due time.
---
Nope, she was BOP.
---
And I already looted her.
---
Sally Whitemane: confirmed to be a shaman.
---
I mean, if a rogue hears you activate it they can just... Wait. For 20 seconds. Or more realistically, they can still sneak up on you anyway. It's not difficult. It got buffed in the 1.4 patch, but that's not what Classic runs on. Have you actually played a human in Classic?
---
And then you PERFECT tanks run off while the priest is oom and die.   There are bad apples in every class.   Just got to make the most out of it.
---
Ohh we  cannot have the "meme" specs get gear.   Fuck that.   How do I avoid toxic players/guilds, like yourself?
---
Luffa is exempt. I tried two days  ago.
---
You shouldn‚Äôt use a period when you should have used a comma or a semicolon, since we‚Äôre on a gatekeeping/ grammar kick.  You shouldn‚Äôt start a sentence with the word like, either. ‚ÄúLike‚Äù is also a poor word choice, traditionally meaning ‚Äúhaving an affinity towards;‚Äù perhaps you mean ‚ÄúSimilar to‚Äù or ‚ÄúSomething akin to.‚Äù

Selection bias. If you do 100 dungeons and have 1 run where someone flamed you, then you will usually remember that 1 run and make a big deal out of it in your head.  
---
You are right, people rarely flame the tanks. I did not see it happen once in my journey from 1-60. I would go as far as to say if you are constantly getting flamed as a tank, you might be a bad tank.
---
It's definitely quality over quantity but your videos are so good, I watched the first 2 plus this one and I laughed so hard for each of them.
---
With improved cheetah or boot enchants, she can't catch up to me even if she boulders me every time she casts it.
---
You can cancel Cheetah during the stun, before the damage happens, btw.
---
Well we have a lot more players for one. And at least I grew up in a manner of "efficiency matters" and doing things right. So either you do stuff the correct way or you just dont do it at all.
---
I've been on both sides.  It's still fun.
---
It‚Äôs not absurd, some people like reading, some people like visuals, some people like actually doing it. Look up universal design for learning it‚Äôs literally required in the school systems these days
---
AFAIK it can be even further increased to 42 with talents.

applies to quests too
---
Earlier today I RP walked to a chair on the boat and sat down as I waited. I feel personally attacked
---
&gt; and stopwatch
---
the first two i could maybe understand but what the fuck
---
It only sends you back once.
---
1) You find the neck
---
2) You go to the gnome to turn it in.
---
3) He sends you back to Uldaman with a scrying phial so you can talk to him from remote.
---
4) You find the dead paladin.
---
5) You find three gems.
---
6) Talk to the gnome with the scrying phial.
---
7) Kill Archimonde and loot quest item.
---
8) Back to Ironforge and get the necklace.
---
So the quest sends you back once. No more.
---
Well, you don't need to be attuned to enter molten core, just to use the shortcut.
---
Is that the "enhancement is not a viable premade pvp spec" guy or just a namethief?
---
I was going to try that once but two 45 horde rogues camped the entrance from Duskwood so it wasn't even possible to enter STV without res sickness for me.
---
How's the dungeon grind?
---
Whats my hit cap as dual wield fury? I plan on using axes as an orc
---
You aren't looking close enough.
---
Yeah, that's ultimately what we had to do. This guy was camping the questing area so we decided to pack it up and go somewhere else. Still stinks to get bullied in a video game though lol.
---
Shouldn‚Äôt start a sentence with the word ‚Äúand.‚Äù
---
‚ÄúAdditionally‚Äù would be a better fit
---
Are you a gnome?
---
Not as easy. You still have stipulations to try and find a job. And seeing how you are not a Swede, it would be even harder.
---
Amazing, so lucky
---
If someone is safe spotting, do remember to report them via the right-click report function.
---
Try killing the same mob one at a time for hours on end as a warrior or rogue cause you re in that dead-zone level wise inbetween areas and quests.. knowing you can never solo elites (since they always have adds) either.. 
---
I could aoe farm as a mage for 5 days straight and not even be doing quests at the same time (ie killing mobs for a quest) and i d be loving it.. all the while i conjure my own food and make portals to cities whenever i want..
---
Is any of this worth the year grind...
---
Because time delays mean he can stay ahead of it.
---
Only downside is that it pings on fly overs
---
Wasn't this in The Shattering? When a flame element went crazy and burned buildings
---
I was thinking when raiding. When that one sword drops from Garr, you will see every warrior and rogue drool over it. Whereas whenever a dagger drops, youre most likely the only one to care :)
---
I honestly dont know much about rogues to comment on which daggers are good :/
---
Definitely Stormwind, how does no one see it?
---
6% with axes as an orc. Anything more isn't useless, but not worth it.
---
The mob health addon is nice for this. 
---
Can start wanding when you see that you can finish off the kill in 3/4 hits by the time the mob which should be slowed, walks over to you.
---
You must be an undead rogue
---
I'm pretty sure they broke census a while ago. Addons can't use the /who functions anymore.
---
Yeah, totally agree with you. It's always fun being a 32 warrior being corpsecamped for 2 hours straight by a 5 man at the GY. You sound like a fucking moron, pvp servers and world pvp is great but don't act like some "people" aren't lett cunts making sure people don't get to have any fun.

So, I have never tried this kind of mouse with a game like WoW, or any game. I've literally only tried it once or twice and in an office setting... where you didn't need to have reactive responses in your mouse movements.
---
My wife does suffer from carpal tunnel and tendonitis so she cant play for long periods of time without feeling pain great enough to have her stop. It can even discourage her from playing because she knows it's inevitably going to happen... Would this mouse alleviate a lot of her problems? And, is this mouse really good for a game like WoW?
---

It's obviously a neutral flight path, I don't understand how you don't see it.
---
Not overdone (at least not this year), this looks dope. Nicely done!
---
Thats why greed is an option. Tanking warrior should not get 2h if someone else that is currently dpsing in a dungeon needs it. Unless it was agreed before the run that tank needs dps gear and dps gear only
---
I'm just keeping my eyes on the prize to 60. I feel pretty confident that a lot of these shitsacks camping lower levels are doing it because they are too bad to handle a fair fight. Can't wait until they don't have a level advantage anymore.
---
I do... do people not do that?
---
If you dont /wave your getting ganked
---
\*sigh\* I picked undead rogue with out knowing any stigma and i get KOS by Alot of ppl all i wanted to do was help you on your chicken quest T.T
---
I mean this is exactly what you want (reserving aside).  The community needs way more tanks for dungeons than for raids, so the only real solution is to have warriors who are actually DPS tank for a bunch of their non-raid runs.
---
Thanks!
---
My friend (who plays warrior) said that pug tanking is like driving school bus full of children. If you don't stare kids all the time soon someone pulls other ones hair, tries to eat gum he found from floor and one kid at back just wet his pants.
---
There is good amount of tanks but they do play only with friends. I am all in tanking for my friends. I know them and I know they listen and understand. But I have for long time stopped tanking pugs. My sanity just is more precious.
---
MS hpal and grinding 5ms from 18-60. Currently 34 and not even close to bored. Long ways to go :)
---
Depends on what you call manageable. 
---
If its only queues on sundays, then its fine. If its a queue at 5-6pm every single day, even if its "only" 1h, then its unmanageable in the long run for the majority of people.
---
I want to be able to play when I feel like it.
---
Eastern plaguelands have some quests rewarding interesting gear (depending on your class), and are close to two dungeons you can hop in at this level : Scholomance and Stratholme.
---
I also use f and g, mine goes qerstfgzx123 exc.
---
Mine is super quiet. I dont really know why. It is like 3/4 of the guild are just npc's never in discord and never write in chat. The rest are guild masters and officers. Who are always in discord and active in officer chat.
---
These are the moments that we remember for the rest of our gaming lives. Big hype, gz!
---
Was their WF Rag pre-submerge?
---
These guys are pretty gud
---
Yeah might have to do that
---
I don't think you know what punctuation is.
---
Reminds me of Mermaid Man from Spongebob for some reason.
---
Alliance dont take picks of it? idk man ive helped a few Allies out. mind you not for hours but i have. i also get killed alot by Alliance for trying to help
---
Hey dum dum. Your comments are all saved to reddit. Anyone doing a cursory scroll through your comments can see that you‚Äôre laying it on extra extra thick right now. If you were educated you would understand Blizzards stance as a company, what happens when you knowingly break contracts like Blitzchung did, and how the emotional reaction of a Blizzard employee on the other side of the world does not necessarily reflect Blizzard as a whole.
---
If you were so educated I wouldn‚Äôt have to explain that if he had said ‚Äútrump is good‚Äù or ‚Äútrump is bad‚Äù he would have received the exact same punishment, because it would be violating the exact same agreement. 
---
Using words like ‚Äúantiquity‚Äù won‚Äôt mask the fact that you clearly don‚Äôt understand common business practices in a digital world. It sure does a great job making you look like a hypocritical internet smart guy who would rather use big words than reason and citation.
---
&gt;And every horde capital has a backdoor to our leader. 
---
Doesn't matter.
---
&gt;The barrens are massive and slow to level. 
---
They're also super easy to quest in, easy pulls, large numbers of mobs in the right areas, but they're divided so you don't back up into higher level mobs. Everything is an easy autorun away.
---
[Haha](https://imgur.com/a/OldEGW7.jpg)
---
No special privileges? Instant groups to anywhere sounds like a special privilege...
---
Probably the VAST majority of players.
---
Hi. How did you message the Mods as I can't see anything in Modmail. Let me know and I'll put this back up. Thanks.
---
come join my groups. Its the easiest tankjob in the world. So easy that often ive invited a 4th mage or a lock instead of a tank  unless im planning to kill any bosses.
---
Only difference is he did not have his own army to come to the rescue in the nick of time
---
Good luck there. Enjoy while there are dumb players to run "reserve groups"
---
Or you could level up and deal with it the right way
---
GER servers are german-speaking. Not saying you can't find english speakers there, but don't expect everyone to understand you if you don't speak german.
---
Got my ring on my second run as dps :D
---
your Doing your best! thats what your doing :D
---
&gt;There are quite a few horde settlements that have low lvl guards spawn and never got fixed in classic. Alliance can roll into them and destroy everything.
---
There are also quite a few horde settlements where they have wandering guards that will destroy anyone questing in that zone. And Alliance has to walk straight through there.
---
Why with an alt? Jump runs are great for tanks
---
Man, you're really upset over nothing. Also, pretended to have been playing since Beta doesn't really much on the internet. I could say that I've been around since the Warcraft days, but that would be a lie. Also, I love how you're sticking to the "pirated server scum" shtick, you're trying to troll but it's not working in your favor and is instead working against you. It's actually quite hilarious and I'm flattered that you're trying so hard for me.
---
To much risk to charge in 90% of the time if a single runner gets away you might wipe.  
---
Better to range pull /los pull.
---
Is it goldshire all over again ?
---
I was with the mage until mentioned rooftops. I'm about 90% sure that Blizzard classifies avoiding guards this way as an exploit that can/should be reported. At very least I recall seeing a post here about a player getting a warning from a GM for this.
---
well done, i admire your work as i am only 500/3000 atm myself 
---
Enjoy !
---
Lmfao this is probably the most hilarious way to fuck with people
---
Archimonde in Uldaman, Classic+ confirmed?
---
Btw the world is round
---
How bad your group must have been to get so close kill?
---
Yes and No
---
Ah yes, escape artist, breaks you out of a non-hard cc, has an interruptable cast time, and doesn't make you immune for 5 seconds. Better off running Free action potions anyway.  
---
Compared to WotF its trash
---
Battle of the Bastards.
---
By your logic, I win.  I am sorry.  I started before you.  I know that upsets you, I am sorry.
---
Lol some high n mighty mod took my comment for saying "youre a fuck" but not "youre a pussy" that makes me laugh you pussy alliance xD
---
Sorry, I did really mean drop quests; for kill quests you are absolutely right that everyone groups up.
---
GatherLite allows sharing your spots with your guild.
---
Yes which brings us to my first point. Nobody gives a shit about other players in the community when loot is in question. The sooner they get what they want the sooner they can stop running that instance and fuck what others need, not their problem anymore until players slowly get discouraged and stop playing then it's Blizzard's fault for making a flawed game.
---
Fuck blizzard
---
I think im at somewhere in the 400 range, really cant justify more than 4 ranks (1, 4 and 9). Rank 1 prepull to put the healing stream buff up, 4 for sustained damage and 9 for precasting.
---
Same thing for chain, i keep 1 and 3. Just to cut the number of binds down a bit.
---
It‚Äôs not really ganking if they attack first. 
---
Anyhow, personally them having a really really bad lolboy name on an RP-PvP sever is grounds for ganking them.
---
Nope
---
Did you guys already forget
---
Except for in Hillsbrand where you just need to collect 30 human skulls
---
Is any other hunter tearing their hair out farming this Mature Blue Dragon Sinew in Winterspring? Been out here for 7 days for hours at a time and no drop. If Tribute farming is super profitable I might just have to buy it off the AH at this rate (500g on my server.)
---
DM is getting released before the first patch, OP is just retarded and can't read the Blizz posts.
---
This is very important to me too I am hoping we get the key ring on Tuesday
---
You may not have been aware of this, but [I made this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d8h528/my_most_recent_classic_wow_mobile_setup_using) a couple weeks ago, and you may have already seen it.
---
your addon tracks your threat, reports your threat on a hidden channel, and displays others' threat reported on that channel.
---
Alliance on Benediction do the same damn thing. I get ganked all the time by groups of Alliance players.
---
That worked thanks.
---
It's about how a value judgement is different than an accepted practice. There are many accept practices despite other people (perhaps in a different country or even a town over) values saying it's wrong to do that. It's a very direct correlation in that regard. If you don't see that other people's values and what they see are right are different, then you must not get out much.
---
If before they start the run they tell you the eye of divinity is on reserve, and then you get to majordomo and are mad you didn't get to roll on it, the guild that put it on reserve didn't do anything wrong. You did for joining that pug, and then you're idiot for getting mad about it later. There are other pugs out there. If you want to join a run with no reserved loot, run with a different pug. 
---
The guild is putting together the run and leading the raid. If you think raid leading and putting together the group with 40 people is easy, then set up the PuGs yourself. It is something that requires a lot of extra work, and I don't mind the raid leader's guild reaping a minor advantage because of that.
---
Thank you for the suggestion :-)
---
I was entirely coherent.  You being irrationally angry at a comment on the internet doesn't change the meaning of a word.
---
...and no, you do not need a massive guild to run a non-pug raid.  Even more so when you consider you don't need forty people.
---
Wtf, I'm a Ubisoft and Epic fan now ...
---
Even as dual wield? Idk i thought i heard that dual wield needs more hit chance? Like 18%/12% instead of the usual 9%/6%
---
I'm level 50 with fury spec and I just picked up a Destiny for 35g. Currently I quest with Thrash blade + Vanquisher sword or Theradras' Scepter. Mind sharing the talents you use? I'm still kind of new to playing warrior and want to make sure I utilize it properly once I hit 52. If you have enchant suggestions I'd love that as well!
---
You need to use repentance on mages. They can‚Äôt blink out of that. And when they do blink, that‚Äôs your chance to land hammer of justice
---
Not a rant. Seeing timers are so useful. For any melee class.
---
I was caught like that yesterday, oh boy, they gave me such a walloping, not going to forget it in a hurry either. 
---
I will add this tho, later on, my raid team started to filter in petty slowly an alliance one was just showing upas well. , just when we started to get to full strength and things really started to pop off, we were layered away. 
---
That was worse then getting turkey trampled by 40 of the bastards.
---
&gt; DPSers always get away with shit they do, like aoe nuking everything, stealing groupwide aggro. Or in general not minding the threatmeter, killing the tank's rage. Or failing to properly cc a marked mob when requested. No one ever got kicked for that, or yelled at for that, in any group I've been in since Classic. 
---
Don‚Äôt join to groups as tank, unless the group have some basic reputation. There are 4 people who are just looking for a tank? Then they are free to join to your group.
---
I know, it was a joke. Good heal/mana in 5man party tho. If it got buffed with +healing it might be ok.
---
Chaotic good
---
Pretty much. Also, getting the quest done faster without dying. I kinda hope he died 50 times in the Barrow Den because he refused to group.
---
People literally offer our guild tanks money to tank dungeons the moment they get online, because there's not enough tanks.
---
In vanilla I believe it only tracks other members threat that have the addon installed as wel
---
You don't have to go there. Desolace is super comfy.
---
*except in China
---
Haha I am in that picture. Earthshaker was crazy yesterday and really a healthy server at this point.
---
I agree. And the organic nature of the conflict is what makes it thrilling. We attack one another for various reason and then it escalates into the death squads we see patrolling areas. Then we feel the need to retaliate. I got bushwhacked in once, one of the wankers was 3-4 levels below me and I passed him by, then he helped a warrior my lvl take me down. Group with two other dudes who were 10 lvls lower who also got bushwhacked and went on a rampage. Hunting down every horde we could find. We split up, and I ran into a group a couple levels below mine so I attacked them, bout got my ass kicked but another dude came in last minute and pulled me out of the fire. Happens a lot, pvp and Pve. Spent a hour and half in that zone and I was only there to pick up a cookbook.
---
As an alliance maybe. As a horde it's a little worse.
---
1) Collect quest from Orgrimmar before you go.
---
2) Find necklace.
---
3) Return to Orgrimmar.
---
4) Find dead body in instance.
---
5) Return to Kargath.
---
6) Full clear instance to get gems etc.
---
7) Return to Kargath.
---
8) Return to Orgrimmar.

That prioritizes your mouseover, then your target, then yourself.  And does the same with a shift-modifier to cast a lower rank.

Oh yeah I missed the dw part, sorry. I don't exactly remember the dw hit cap but iirc it's something ridiculous and barely worth to reach.
---
&gt; 45-60 is the longest part of the leveling experience where people will spend almost half of their time leveling.
---
No way. I got 44 recently, maybe I should just quit lol
---
If you're using 6 as a button why not use R and T also. No matter what you do those are closer than 6 right.
---
As a tank I don't recognize this at all. If you don't start flaming your party they likely won't be flaming you (unless you suck and deserve it). Most of my dungeon experiences has been friendly and nice even though some of them has been full of wipes. The guilty party usually apologizes regardless of their role. The only truly toxic dungeon I've partaken in was a 10 man "spell cleave" SM arms with everyone blaming everyone for "not enough xp/hr at this speed it's too slow" and I promptly left to never join such a thing again. There are individual cases of trash people acting trash, but that is absolutely not the majority.
---
Sergio!
---
Probably not just for the quest but may as well get it done if you like doing dungeons for levelling / want some specific loot from Uldaman.
---
Some dumbass hunter tried to kill me when I was running to MC today. 
---
I‚Äôm a priest, jumped down into the lava near the ramp after he shot at me a couple times. He followed me down, landing right next to me... so I just feared him and he died in the lava lmao
---
Hamish is just as big of an asshole as the rest imo. He's got literally no reason to disband the guild/discord, except to make it harder to figure out what he did with the hand of rag mats, gbank mats, and gbank gold. Keeping the guild together is by far the easiest way to distribute everything back out and spread info like he claims he wants to do.
---
I also can't help but note that he's drawing a shitload of attention to what they did (with him watching the whole time) while saying almost nothing about what he's doing, despite him being the one with access to all the valuable shit now.
---
WC is a nightmare for a new tank. Almost all partial caster groups, spread apart so you can't get them in melee range easily, often the furthest mob is already in aggro range of the next group so face pulling the whole room is inevitable if someone runs over.
---
They heal, they cc party members, they run away and the design of the dungeon makes line of sight pulling a challenge in many cases.
---
Add to that there is this stupid serpentbloom quest where after you pulled suddenly someone is always busy picking flowers or skinning some mobs or mining or whatever and not helping interrupt and kill the group and it can really turn into a mess.
---
I'm certain in pvp servers, not entirely sure on pve servers but my bet is it's the same thing, to prevent collusion with the opposite faction. Every /e thing comes out as "X makes strange gestures" for the other faction.
---
the name of the game is AoE for faster clears
---
You contribute to the raid as a player. You're not twiddling your thumbs waiting for loot that you buy.
---
I love those groups "LFM Need tank" and you join the group and it's ONE other person and he hands you lead then AFKs while you fill the group lol
---
I play alliance on horde heavy server. I get usually ganked by 10+ level horde. Especially undead rogues which seem most of time be major assholes.
---
After getting sick of it, sometimes we form a small group and decide to  return the favor to horde players in the area.
---
But yeah, nobody really into having fair fights. It is always from behind when you are fighting a mob
---
I remember the days killing all the flight masters so the horde could not level or travel anywhere. We did it as a guild and locked them out of all the zones in Lich King.
---
I can't express how much I laughed after reading the last line.   üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Rune of the guard captain, its from the elite troll quest where you have to kill like 80 of them. Super worth it though.
---
Just reached 42 and got my mount! 1-3h/day. Played is around 140-150h
---
You can't kill a Mage that fast.
---
Congrats dude !
---
Expecting to have the exclusive right on every item you need on your first instance run is selfish if you willingly chose to play the class/spec with the same item needs as most other classes just because you have to do actual work *once*.
---
And, also, you should have some!
---
Thanks, this really helped. I updated the code now. If you want you can check it out. I would really appreciate it.
---
If you're going to be pushing rank 14 you'll not be looking at your character much if at all.
---
I‚Äôd argue that the first patch does not equal phase 2. 
---
I would not be surprised if the keying came out with DM later this week
---
DM is the first content patch.  I'm not sure how you say anything otherwise.  The original plan was that the keyring would come with the first content patch.  I haven't yet seen anything indicating this will or will not be the case.
---
Captain... On your left.
---
I wish I could tell if this were a serious question or not
---
I wish i could :(. But all my friends want to play on PVP (dunno why though...there is no benefits)

Naw its satire for the dude trying to push politics into WoW. I'd prefer it stay in the blizzard subreddit.

Mage vs warrior in a nutshell
---
Whats yeet?
---
tanking is really really really difficult until you learn to do it properly.  then its pretty easy, but until then you'll probably feel like the world is out to get you.
---
I feel your pain, bro. 27-35 was tough for me. As soon as I got my WW axe at 32 things started speeding up but a lot of grinding has gone by the last days.
---
STV was full of gankers and I was leveling really slowly there. Things sped up when I moved to Desolace and then Badlands. Higher mob density, lower player count.
---
Ahhh dang, alright ty!
---
This is my favorite troll-bait in awhile
---
it definitely drops from the slaves outside, did it today
---
Plus they don't live in dungeons. Questing and farming is a thing.
---
too early in the morning for me to understand that..
---
This is basically how I play too. I have 0 interest in killing anyone 10 levels below me, each to their own but I can‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs fun with no skill involved. Most alliance have been friendly, and I have a /sigh macro if they attack me after a /wave. Have yet to be attacked one on one by anyone close to my level. Announce in general and see if anyone is interested or as a warning and move on. Then again I play on Oceania server off peak so it‚Äôs prob a bit late for everyone back home in oz and it seems like they just want to get quests done.
---
YEET is my guild!
---
Oooh, that the case? Hmm..
---
Which addon do most use then?
---
Imagine someone selling an item in trade chat for a stupid price, sure no one's gonna buy that and get harmed from it, but it's very annoying.
---

---
I had to choose between aspect of the cheeta, frost trap and dual wield yesterday...
---
I'm zooming between ore nodes now!
---
At the very least they should have to pass a resist check like fire for example. Then they would be a little bit more balanced but not much.
---
There is no progress right now. Every random grp can clear the content without problems.

AoE farming is really fast but it requires good spots to grind. Every day I see those mages who pick up three mobs, blizzard them down and then think it is AoE farming. It's not. You need big packs and you need are where you can constantly farm mobs.
---
Something about undead rogues. Especially the ones with that one haircut, you know the one I'm talking about...
---
They would even piss me off when I group with them as a horde player just from the decisions they make and their overzealousness/ego.
---
Been getting the same feeling about gnome frost mages lately on alliance. The overwhelming majority seem to have no interest in cooperating with a group and are ultimately concerned with themselves over everything. Not all, but the majority that I've encountered.
---
There do seem to be a ton of gnome frost mages lately due to the jokerD world first hype and all that, so I will probably get some inevitable hate for saying that around here lol
---
That the case? Gotcha!
---
Just a question of figuring out what most ppl are using then I guess
---
Are there some sort of rivalry going on, or are you just miles better players?
---
Yeah, I hope you can accept receiving help some time soon. Seems like it would be a good first step. Good luck.
---
Yah
---
&gt; Better to range pull /los pull. To get the safe zone for runners.
---
Indeed. Thats how i do it in my 5-man multiboxing. Possible runners are pain in the ass as im not the most efficient dps in the world (and cant really use consus properly, too many buttons).
---
I‚Äôm not sure what you mean be top tier as actual top ranked world guilds are alliance. Every realm has competitive enough guilds on both factions though.
---
Is part of the fun. Killing them once shows hey this is a harsh world welcome to pvp. If you camp them then i do not really support it.
---
James loves meh
---
On Horde side: 
---
When 10+ players killed a single alliance player and calls it world PvP.

Sick burn

In my server that camp was no go zone for allies. Multiple ganking hordes around it always (horde heavy server)
---
Whole STV was/is unplayable

Whoever told you that doesn't know jack about warlocks since Classic/Vanilla is one of the best times to play one. Not only you get a free mount, ton of fun spells and the ability to solo some end game content that only hunters could, in raids your damage is competitive with mages (though mostly in later phases since at this point we lack +hit gear) you also have a ton of unique utility that saves people time running into the instance, which is invaluable since getting anywhere takes much longer in Classic.
---
anyone using a threat addon writes to a "hidden channel" (will not show up in your "chat box") and then your threat addon displays that information it gathers from the channel and shows it on via your  addon display. If people are not using an addon, they are not writting to the channel and the addon has no data from them.

&gt;However, I am confused with what race and gender combo I should select for my Rogue. (...) Aesthetics and attack animations play a huge roll in selection for me.

Ravager is no joke BIS for hunter AOE.

Bro, no matter how you look at it, he participated, helped it, and in the end stole the loot. He's just as bad as the rest, except he thinks he isn't.
---
Sorry your wrong.  Hands of freedom and hoj should be more then enough to win that fight unless you are underground or a wasd walker
---
Where do you get 5000 from? Blizzard has said that each layer is the size of a normal sized server in 2004-2006 which would mean somewhere between 2500 and 3500.
---
Blessing of freedom, divine protection, repentance, hammer of justice. 
---
Judgement them while under repentance, judgement again while hammered, a couple auto swings and the mage should be dead. If they‚Äôre smart, they‚Äôll ice block the repentance before you can judge. Use freedom to close gap to get in range of hoj and use judgement right before hoj falls off, that way you at least get an auto swing in with crusader up, then judge. If they block again after the hoj, you can bubble but stay on top of them, blink still won‚Äôt be up.

Any fix found?

I used to spare everyone green in level to me or below.
---
Then one day (I shit you not 3 times in a row), I spared 3 different guys while farming. Minding my business, then they come back with 2 of their buddies and gank me.  Happened to me 3 times in a day. This doesn't include all the times I've ignored people while farming, then they wait until I'm low on health and mana to gank me.
---
Its rarely a fair fight in world PvP, so fuck all of them. I kill everyone I see now.
---
Until governments actually act with legislation that hinders the vast influence and power that China currently posesses over international companies very little will change.

Holy shit my sides. You should be very proud of this. HOLY FUCK SO GOOOOOOOD!
---
You can try it for free for the first 20 levels. If you have subscribtion for classic you can play retail up to like lvl 100 or whatever was the cap of the last expansion. The only thing you can't access is the newest expansion.
---
False.

I did some pretty pathetic stuff last night in STV. 
---
But my life is perfectly fine. Wife, home, successful work life yada yada.

Sometimes you just want to be the asshole for a minute. It‚Äôs refreshing.
---
STV: You can't fart anywhere in the zone without an undead rogue smelling it.
---
You‚Äôre an actual child, aren‚Äôt you?
---
&gt; No it's not they have the numbers. The games they have put out were the best at some point.
---
Did you even read what you replied to? Yes, they used to make great games, nowadays they don't (IMO).
---
God...I hate those idiots who go out their way to one-shot lower players, we get it your way higher than I'm and I'm an easy kill for you...

Why is your UI not centered? It pains me

Reminiscing on all those Alliance lowbie kills you got earlier in the day  :‚Äô)
---
So you're not even a tank but you know OPs situation perfectly, yes? I see!
---
RFC is usually bad because people don't know their class yet. It gets better as you get higher level. Now that I'm level 48 on my bear most runs are really smooth. Only had a couple of bad ones with a healer who didn't bring water and a shaman healer in full agil/strength gear. So it might be worth it to try again!
---
Alright so picture this.
---
Your threat meter addon is basically a little tiny overseer guy that works for your character. Imagine for a moment that he's a little guy that sits on your character's shoulder and pays attention to all the stuff your character is doing in game. He sees how much damage you're doing, he sees who you're dealing damage to, and he checks your buffs and talents to see how much threat your damage generates. Then he does some quick maths to figure out how much threat you're generating and he writes it down on a little note.
---
Then the overseer takes that note and puts it in a little envelope. Then he gives that envelope to a little mail man whose job it is to make sure the mail gets passed around to all the other little overseers who are hard at working watching your party members and making sure that they too know how much threat they're generating.
---
The overseer is the threat meter addon. The mail man is the addon channel. The mail man makes sure that the little overseers may pass their little notes around and let everybody who's doing what in terms of threat.
---
You played WoW since 2006 and never did ZG?
---
Quit bitching. As a tank you get near instant group invites and you can replace your shit DPS in a matter of minutes. Go fury if you're not man enough to lead.
---
Lol.

---
Absolutely seething
---
&gt;If they‚Äôre smart, they‚Äôll ice block the repentance before you can judge.
---
That's where it all falls apart. I've been able to kill some mages who don't do this, but if they Ice Block repentance in that crucial period where I need to stay on top of them after they've used blink and when I'm in melee range ready to Judge, I'm boned. I prefer to just try to run from Mages at this point.
---
Just roll a pve alt. When things get annoying, switch to that for a couple of hours. Tell your friends. Some of them might join you...
---
thunderfury
---
Damn that's 100% on point with my experiences of dwarf warriors vs human warriors too, lol...
---
Ran the Scarlet Monastery Armory with a human warrior yesterday, and he did exactly what you described of them and we ended up wiping until everyone's armor was red and we had to give up. Ran all of SM (plus an extra library run) with a dwarf warrior today, and he was very patient and methodical with his approach and we barely had any close calls, and nobody even died once. Crazy how much difference some patience and chillness can make.
---
As far as the gnome mages I definitely do think it's mostly my personal experience and that it's because a lot of them are mainly trying to grind as fast as possible to emulate the world first level 60 guy with some letting that get to their head but I definitely don't want to over generalize with that statement
---
Mograine EU?
---
Deadmines**
---
As a healer, starting with uldaman the dungeons get a lot less forgiving. Damage gets spiky, there are nasty debuffs, mobs stun or silence a lot. The groups get bigger, they do aoe or have nasty cc for the group.
---
There are large groups appearing where tanks have a hard time, aggroing all the mobs before you have to pump out heals (e.g. those dwarves/golem groups in uldaman, elemental packs in maraudon), so talents that speed up casts and give you a chance to not get interrupted really start to help. Fights take longer, so mana efficiency also starts to count for more, especially when stuff gets chain pulled.
---
And sure, at level 20 you only got 10 talent points, which doesn't really matter all that much. At 40 you can go down one tree to the ultimate, so it makes more of a difference with every level.
---
So as healer, you have to know the dungeon and capabilities of the mobs, you really need to use your whole arsenal of skills and abilities and know, when to use them. Plus you can't really compensate for stupid anymore in many cases, if some in your party don't know what they are doing, you can't just save them anymore by pumping out a few heals, you need to know when to cut your losses.
---
I wish I could do that! I have like 7 characters at mid 20s. I try to use them each then they have a decent amount of rested xp so at least I'm being efficient about being slow.
---
Do what and how?
---
There is also kill on Sight addon that was introduced to me when paladin and hunter killed me while oom and half HP.
---
That would be okay but the stupid /spit emote got me.
---
So after a while of spamming general with name and ordering tanaris to look for the player, I was introduced to this epic addon.
---
Basically you create your own kill list and when you meet the player again, you will get notification.
---
Addon name is SPY I think.
---
If they're grey, I tag em with something non-damaging to remind em, then leave.
---
They are BIS for alli hunters. Until later phases
---
Honestly - no
---
Early group content like RFC and deadmines dont require any insight. Reading ability tooltips is plenty enough. People have like 5 spells at that level, so OP probably wasnt refering to their skillset but what they had to do in the dungeon or where to go.
---
not the question i asked. i know they will resist more. 16% hit is required for bosses yet golemagg seems to resist MORE often than the other bosses and the logs for mages in general seem to show this - hence why i was asking if there was any information regarding specific boss stats/resistances etc.
---
Finding a group for ZF is a bitch. Nobody is doing that dungeon.
---
I would have just left the group to begin with. I hate this
---
had a undead rogue trying to do this in tenaris, i popped recklessness and oneshotted him then i died. worth it.
---
Good idea, thanks :)
---
I love thinly sliced cabbage with shreds of carrot and a slightly tart yet sweet creamy dressing.
---
Was questing with a rogue there yesterday and he wanted to kill a warrior and I said ‚Äúno leave the guy alone‚Äù and he was ok with that but later he started attacking two warriors and I kind of just had to go along with it and helped killing these poor warriors. Felt really bad about it. Was much happier queuing for a spawn whilst killing mobs with a warrior (opposite faction) the day before.
---
You can‚Äôt say that after reading one side of the story man, if it is as bad as Hamish claims then everyone would‚Äôve left on their own accord already. The fact is all of the manifest had been taken out of context and fabricated with no solid proof, from what I‚Äôve seen at this point Hamish has more anger in his system than the entire guild
---
&gt; Ofcourse it is, but when i say engineering here i mean just mass sapper charging unsuspecting raids.
---
Raid vs raid has always been 'who has the most aoe nuke/bombs' Before sapper charges, most mages aoe/cleave. For 'skill' you go down to a small scale level
---
Honestly as soon as I heard Classic was happening I got excited that TBC might then happen afterwards, definitely the best expansion IMO.
---
For beginners I would suggest killing an elite, then killing the 4 healers, and then finishing of the elites. Healers should be sheeped untill they are ready to be killed. The 3 elites that you keep alive for a while can either be off-tanked or kited.
---
You don‚Äôt know what the word ‚Äútoxic‚Äù means.

Seriously guys, team up. Three lvl 40 players can take on a level 60 player (not easy, but definitely not impossible either).
---
My guess is 95% of the reddit users only browse on there phone and arn't even logged in on there pc.
---
Maybe go look at the blizz post saying DM is releasing ON ITS OWN BEFORE PHASE 2. But go ahead and downvote me for saying whats happening.
---
It's the one trickle-down-effect that works :P
---
Same boat. 53 here :(
---
Oh I see, you are referring to the Horde, the faction with the Undead Rogues.
---
This is arguably even smarter to do unless you are in a hurry to hit that final level. At the time I did grind/kill quests in EPL and just decided I'll complete them all without turning in before dinging - pretty much paid for my level 60 skills plus a few I've neglected earlier.
---
Basically as others said. Use wand either when out of mana or when the mob have less health than the damages done by one frostbolt.
---
SO much better than taking the kill.
---
definitely not a true horde player
---
There's no future for prot warrior, you would quit one way or another. Tank spots in guilds are taken long ago and without raids there's no end-game in Classic.

Lost count of the amount of times I've been killed while sitting drinking/eating after a big pull. I think it's largely anti-mage sentiment. Usually extracts a sarcastic "Wow well done you're so skilled!". It's part of a PvP realm though, had plenty of fun in actual fights, especially during Onyxia attunement. My group and an Alliance group seemed to match each other step for step so there was always a fight at each Dragon. Usually ended up in it accidentally being pulled and everyone dying!
---
I'm a shadowbolter tank :D.

I don't tank nor heal, I kill peeps, I'm a Warlock.

Tho I was mostly messing with u, I defend the Druid tankers because I ran the content with a PRO Druid feral, dude put a lot of Warrs to shame.

I've seen it literally once and that tank was retarded over a long period of time.

I'm glad you've shared that with us.

I killed an AFK lvl 60 (i assume) gnome warlock in ratchet as a level 19 orc rogue (i was in a bad mood, took it out on a poor gnome). He ended up coming back to gank me 5 times while camping my body. Every time i was half a second from flying out of there before i got oneshot :(  deserved, i guess
---
100% buy it, the average time it takes to farm you could have made twice that in pure gold.
---
Every time you run into someone from the opposite faction you roll a die.  
---
Sometimes you roll nice and fair. Sometimes you roll douche bag.  
---
It's all RNG.
---
Everyone should enjoy the game there own way dude!
---
52. Have a level 18 as well
---
I don't know Altoholic. But with Bagnon you can View inventories of your alts. Dunno about profession though
---
Also, you have to accept that in Blackrock Mountain in the evenings there is a decent chance you'll come across a raid group summoning people. Warlocks aren't going to pass on free soul shards.
---
After cata, all the races they started adding got weird as fuck. Blood elves and goblins 100% belonged in the game, Worgen and Draenei were just fine, and they fit. I‚Äôm not sure what kinda of class they‚Äôd add specific to alliance/horde, but I would‚Äôve liked a tinker class limited to goblins and gnomes.
---
Personally, I keep a list using Spy and only kill on sight those that wronged myself, my friends, my guild or if I hear about anything in chat.

Let's me enjoy catching assholes unaware, but I also get to keep peace with most others!

It can for a warlock but that's basically it. It is uncontested BiS for every other class.
---
What are you stances about terrain exploiting in dungeons? 
---
Is it something your looking to penalize or prohibit in any way going forward?
---
Yeah, I can absolutely relate to what you are saying. I still tank though, I just cant do multiple runs because its too stressful. As a DD its just lean back and dont fuck up. Throw in some interrupts here and there, dont cleave too hard, occasionally slow or taunt a mob off the healer. If I do all that people actively commend and thank you for doing a good job. Meanwhile a tank is doing more as baseline.
---
Your guild's GM is kind of hero lol

I hesitate now to go in as a Healer Shaman at lvl 45+
---
I do have Int gear ready and locking away 10+ bag slots with that but I've seen the change in difficulty. I think I'll level as enhance up to 51 before switching to Ele / Resto. This will make things easier for everyone.
---
I never had the need for a swing timer on my ARMS warrior. By the time you've done 30ish levels you get a feel for swing interval. That only chances slightly, if you go from a fx 3.00 to a 3.80 weapon speed, or the other way. But then again, it just takes half an hour or so to get accustomed to the new swing intervals.
---
I've gotten a swing timer a week or so ago, and I'm thinking about removing it. It feels like it's making me pay less attention to the fights.
---
Realm transfers

Pretty sure that will be gg for you unfortunately. Don‚Äôt know for sure but if blizzard aren‚Äôt correcting errors with loot allocation they won‚Äôt fix this.

Nope. A guild run with just a few pug spots is really ideal for someone pugging, assuming the guild isn't doing shit like rolling need for each other. Mostly guild runs are almost always going to faster / more stable than entirely pug runs.
---
This is a thing. The era of guild consolidation is underway.

Yesterday i hit lvl 20, still a long way to 60.
---
I'm fine with the concent as it is.
---
Same experience. The hunter fucks up, then feigns death so is the sole survivor (learning nothing from the mistake), and then ofc grabs all the loot. I usually ignore their join requests when forming a group, just not worth it. They add nothing.
---
Can I haz your stuff?
---
I did one on Saturday and the gold pool was over 10k everyone in the raid got 235g at the end and I left with my T2 pants :)
---
Hunters are trash. Sit in their dead zone and they can literally only auto attack you with their pet.
---
Hello, I'm using Perl for Classic, and in the target section there is the option to show the buff and debuff timer but it doesn't seem to work for enemies, I don't see the timer for any of my debuffs I put on the enemy as a warlock. Anyone knows how I can see the duration of a debuff underneath my target? Thanks a lot!
---
Add me: Cigarman
---
I stop reading recruitments that say Loot council. Its just a way for the GM and officers to take all loot under the excuse that its to "speed up progress". The only members of a guild that like Loot council are the couple high rank members.
---
Yeah yeah. You're all really good people and you fart rainbows. We get it
---
Not in world pvp. Weapon skill is normalized in BGs though.
---
You can still do it, but it is more of a team work. A dps that isn't watching movies while doing dungeons and has bought more than 2 skills can easily peel that one mob off of you and bring it back to the tank or cc or stick a pet on it or interrupt the worst casts or not stand in shit etc. So in pugs it is just a gamble, get a guild group with people that know what they are doing and you could be flying through dungeons without a hitch.
---
I've had zf runs where I used less then 10 drinks, 1 mana pot during a mishap with a pat and I was poking stuff with my dagger from time to time because it almost got boring. And I had a run, where my 2 stacks of drinks and 1 stack of mana pots were almost running out while not even doing all bosses with every cooldown in constant use and panic mode throughout.
---
Start up on it again,  spec to fully tank builds (can still dps just fine for quests). Use rejuv and thorns pre pull, swipe tab larger pulls. Don't be afraid to call out dumb dps for being dumb.  G2 stick up for yourself, I'm a 50 bear and still run into mongoloids all the time,  but less as you move on. Try to avoid the aoe dungeons if you want to practice at your own pace.  Sm gy sm cath zf are where i had most of my headaches.  Form your own groups,  call the shots, announce its going to be a normal run. Announce single targeting. When you advertise this the aoe mages will often avoid them. Don't let the few ruin the rest,  the vast majority of my runs are great but i remember the bad ones. Don't let those nobbers win. Bears are great,  use the sidebar links to help. Gl friend.
---
Glad you get it.
---
Oh my god who the hell cares
---
The key ring wasn't added until parch 1.11 so the majority of Vanilla was played without it. We should consider ourselves lucky they are giving it to us earlier than phase 6. So until then, just enjoy the #nochanges.
---
There's nothing selfish about not wanting to tank. Pull your head out of your ass.

I totally expected to see someone run into Rexxar and get slaughtered. Does he aggro on alliance players based on proximity?
---
Maybe its some kind of self fulfilling prophecy.
---
Bad tanks attract bad healers and bad dps reaulting in a group where everyone is insulting everyone and parting way.
---
After the group is disbanded everyone thinks its the fault of others and not realising they are bad.
---
And next group cycle repeats.
---
Why only P3? I'm pretty sure people are already gearing out their twinks for P2.

It's moments like those that test how much you Care about the game and eventually makes the experience special for those who stick around.

I checked out all of your videos after this one. You have got SERIOUS talent! Cinematography and animation is absolutely incredible, and your work is tragically under-appreciated. I‚Äôve seen plenty of wow machinima over the years, and your style is my favorite by miles. You‚Äôve got a great eye for timing and use of small details that really make your scenes pop. 10/10 Please continue making stuff! I can see a bright future ahead of you in your endeavors :)
---
When your most common problem with your preferred economic structure is that people apparently can even agree on a basic definition of it, it may have a more basic problem.
---
With the new AoE meta BS, it's actually more efficient to tank in fury/2H along a WF totem, than trying to properly play in def stance with shield. Yes you will take tons of damage and healer will burn is mana fast, but still slower than if you go shield and all the DPS retards pulls aggro at the beginning of pull because they don't wait for a bit and healer needs to heal 3 out of 5 peoples.
---
The only moment I am able to properly tank is if I have 3+ level over the mobs, then I usually don't miss/parry/dodge attacks that much and can barely keep aggro even with DPS rushing Damage meter.
---
Bottom line is, I know get in touch with healer and tell him I will go zerg.
---
I'm also new to bear tanking and i have learned some things you might find useful.
---
Communicate with your party and take control. Tell them to hold the Aoe while you build some threat. Stop and make mana and buffs calls.  
---
In packs with casters mobs, tell your party to back up and wait, pull the mobs and run back behind a wall/pillar or something so the casters have to run up to melee range, hit them a couple of times for threat and let your party aoe them. You only have to tell them once, after just say same and they will probably understand what to do. 
---
Learn the bosses mechanics, and before pulling make sure everyone knows them.
---
Be aware of mobs running a pat, if is going away, mark it so you know when it's coming back and tell your party to call if they see one you missed. 
---
Don't forget your charge, you can use it to go in but also to get to that mob that's running to your healer. 
---
Repair your gear before the dungeon.
---
Buy your Battle rez reagents. 
---
Add the people that worked well with you in the dungeon and find an active guild. 
---
That's some, hope it helps.
---
Nice to see players leave, less annoying to quest
---
There‚Äôs a Reserved on Arugal that literally just ninja anything they want, can‚Äôt say I wasn‚Äôt warned I guess.
---
That sucked.
---
If it‚Äôs red, it‚Äôs dead.
---
Levelling as a warrior, literally every single mage just ganked me on sight. Pure free kill, even if im a few levels higher. That said, I'm Horde so they were mostly gnomes.
---
Love the eye effect!! Makes ya look more badass ;)
---
The dumbassery of humans
---
Come back when u spent 18hours finding the pet.
---
Are you honestly surprised you burnt out on a game when you‚Äôve spent 20 of the last 48 days playing it?
---
Excellent work, I subbed, keep up the good work!!!
---
same. The goofy pandas were...weird, but MoP made me quit because of the talents being gone. Loving classic though.
---
I had never done BRD before this time around as I never made it to 60 in vanilla. I lost it when I first went there. Couldn‚Äôt stop thinking of the Mines of Moria.
---
Anecdotal, but in my experience of playing both factions (before war mode), I would say Horde does tend to gank more in general. Obviously it‚Äôs hard to say which faction actually tends to gank more as it‚Äôs dependent on anecdotes and majority factions tend to be more cocky so it‚Äôs also different on each server,
---
Hmph... edgy.
---
Large scale pvp is incredibly fun, I'll give you that!
---
Usually though, I'm going places and don't have time to stick around for long. Limited time to play and much to do!

---
Depends on the needs and demands of your raid! As a shammy healer you are primarily being used for totems (I think) with the mana one and the wind fury one. If you clear the content fine I don‚Äôt imagine it being a problem. Seems to be worth having a conversation with key people in your guild, see what‚Äôs up.
---
Is there an updated thread with a date of release? Pretty sure that's what the op is asking....
---
Hey what UI addon is this? It's nice
---
As a holy priest I've grinded mobs for the same or better xp than dungeons.
---
It's faster than many classes.
---
Like I said, non-peak. Talking 6-11am range. If I do have a chance to get on during peak, it's very obviously going to have more people running the less used instances. Also, the people down voting me, the no-changes group, you'll end up killing the game just as fast as retail did for most of us. Stagnation is just as bad as poorly implemented design.
---
Steps 4-6 can be done in one run if the party agrees, as the body is right at the start before you kill anything relevant for the follow up. Still a pain.
---
Bartender :)
---
Out of curiosity, what pet are we talking about?
---
On Deviate Delight, it feels like 75% chance the opposing player will be friendly! I‚Äôve done the MC and fort buff thing many times, with only one guy who retaliated after buffing him (but he was a warlock so it doesn‚Äôt matter :)

This has to be the stupidest bit of (what you think is) ‚Äúlogic‚Äù I‚Äôve read in a while. Screwing someone over during an epic class quest doesn‚Äôt have some greater meaning ‚Äî you‚Äôre either a dick for doing it or not.

---
I read more than one in this sub that scamming ppl is against the ToS and contacting Blizzard can "fix" situations like this (they remove items, ban, eyc..). Isn't this a clear case of scam?
---
Hi guys! I am trying to decide my next alt (Horde). Which role is more in demand in Dungeons/Raids, Healer or Tank?
---
Awesome
---
Blizzard API doesnt allow to check for rank so every rank is shown as max rank casttime.
---
Many mobs use different levels thou which results in casts being fired before the castbar is full.
---
Dude luck isn't something you have or have not. Its rng. It averages out over time.
---
Literally noone cares about itemization while leveling.
---
Agreed!
---
One day a lucky enha shaman will come...
---
Well, if that's the case let's hope you get lucky - would be nice of them if they did a restore of course, but in the end it's user error so not sure whether they do that or not (anymore). 
---
Still, I'd probably just tame another pet meanwhile, go on leveling and enjoying the game. Unsubbing for not getting help (thus far) with an error you did yourself seems a bit silly to me, but I bid you good luck.
---
Exactly this.
---
When you have a jobs with normal business hours and a family or other liabilities in life no queue is "manageable". When I get home from work and still have to cook and do chores around the house I don't wanna wait in a 1 hour queue to then get not a single quest done because of unhealthy overfilled servers.
---
I know, I know just do the chores while waiting in the queue. Uhm, nope? Not if I have the chance to not even get into a queue **and** play on a healthier server.
---
"Details!" is your best bet.  It comes with a plugin called TinyThreat that works with anyone who also has Details or Recount installed (which still isn't everyone, but it's A LOT more folks than have CTM).
---
Or in real life. I can't understand why people just can't accept that life isn't fair and move on with it.
---
The frustration I do understand. But life is equally unfair for everyone.
---
This is just grand
---
It's true, and some standard publishing formats don't use the spaces anymore.
---
However, if you look at the usage of the ellipsis as we'd recognize it throughout literature (only a few hundred years) it's predominantly with spaces because the older form of the ellipsis was made with spaced out dashes instead.
---
It's the standard period character. I checked.
---
I'd be happy to play the first \~3-6 months without 1.12 itemization as well, which is a huge buff for some classes and makes a lot of drops from later dungeons and even mc irrelevant.
---
But who decides which major changes during the original vanilla lifecycle were overall "good" or just big qol changes (like f.e. sending multiple items in 1 mail, which was only introduced in tbc) which we should get from start, and which ones we should only get in later phases?
---
wow what a bad video

Learn it and sell the shirts. There are people like me out there who like to have their characters coordinated and looking nice who will pay for a unique colored shirt, like purple or pink.

Not really a raid is it
---
FROSTSHOCK!
---
Armchair sociologist I see. 
---
It‚Äôs a video game dude. PvP literally only appeals to people because it‚Äôs a way to live out survival of the fittest in low stakes arenas. It doesn‚Äôt hold some deeper meaning about how susceptible people are to ill actions against others. 
---
‚ÄúA significant portion of humanity is basically just trash.‚Äù

PFFFT. You‚Äôre trash bro.
---
Flying is kind of a form of progression in TBC though.  You need it to reach some of the content.
---
Probably an unpopular opinion but I don't really mind flying mounts killing world PvP.  95% of world PvP is just ganking anyways.
---
Yes, you can walk into BWL, but the portal is in UBRS so have fun zoning in without the teleport.
---
Tanking tends to be the most APM intensive and additionally you seem to always be the one dealing with figuring out what mobs to pull, marking them, avoiding pats, and fixing others mistakes. It‚Äôs annoying when people seem to just turn their brains off and your left figuring everything out. That being said, it‚Äôs not that hard of a job and I typically have been treated very well.
---
Dude that is my absolute favorite. Enacting justice on the pricks that ganked my ass when I stood no chance at winning the fight. Pure karmic satisfcation.
---
on my server it's 'Lacoste'

they are selling shirts with 1000% margin.  :D

I'm glad you liked the video :)

Are you implying that ppl should just hang out in contested areas and simply wait for an enemy player in their level range?

Doesnt respect me by /kneel or running out of my way as I run by on my Mount*
---
yesterday I was leveling my warrior in badlands just minding my business. Suddenly hunters pet started running at me and i knew it was GO TIME! I charged at the hunter and it was on. We both got pretty low with my few lucky crits and well the hunter just drained my life out of me with his god damn gun. As I was just landing my final blow the hunter's pet kills me.. altought I died it was good and fair pvp and you don't see it that often while leveling so thanks to you hunter bastard..
---
That's why most of these shirts are bought by bank alts, who don't wear other armor. 
---
Everybody should have a stylish bank alt, I hate those  lvl1s who just run into the bank in their rags or underwear. They should be expelled by the guards.
---
Totally forgot that you teleport in with a orb!
---
I'm not sure if it is the same for raids, but in dungeons a tank is always the hardest thing to find.
---
Out of current 127 upvotes, over 90 are upvoted by apes members.

---
-random hunter from your server
---
Nah, we reserve way more than that and no one bit he's, we also clear mc in an hour though so..
---
It frequently is hard to tell whether something got counted when doing things like looking for Jed due to the way it often count party changes and even leader changes sometimes. Easy to get locked by accident. Also, the ability to see how long until it unlocks would be very helpful because you're not usually expecting to get locked when you do get locked, so you likely don't recall when you first went in.
---
Prot and haven't bought many fury spells üò¨
---
Exactly this, I've been tanking exclusively since launch, have not had a single experience this person described. And what's this ridiculous scenario at Drak about not having a second tank? That's something figured out before the run starts, you typically have 2 tanks throughout the run...
---
Yes, I'm only doing guild runs now and everyone in the guild knows that I want them (and my "luck" is becoming a meme) :P
---
At last, I'm making a fair amount of gold.
---
I laughed way too hard at this
---
Sounds like that pally came fresh from retail.
---
You're right, tuaren rogue is the best rogue
---
It's always been Revered since it was added to the game. It was added in a later patch, but was never at Exalted.
---
Wish there was an addon to play some jazz when you summoned him.
---
It‚Äôs apparently a good forum for making shit up and jerking yourself off when people ‚Äúdon‚Äôt get it‚Äù because it isn‚Äôt a thing, though.
---
What is RNJ?
---
I would be really mad as a Mage to lose a roll on the staff to a moonkin. But as a Druid, congrats, i'll have my T1 before every member of my raid get at least 1 loot so i wont have my hand on a Weapon anytime soon :(
---
"what's the rush" "I've been 60 for 2 weeks"
---
That‚Äôs just plain false. Deadmines requires plenty of insight, here are some things that come to mind:
---
-	Patrols that spawn behind you.
---
-	Pulling Ogre boss without the adds
---
-	Burning down Smites adds before the 60% health stun
---
-	Avoiding Greenskin aggro on ramp
---
I am sure it won't be the server first, that would be very unlikely after 7 weeks.  But  is indeed quite rare.  If you learn it , it can be a nice long term income, but these shirts don't sell like hot dogs..   Expect to sell a couple a week for a few gold each.
---
&gt; warlocks are aways useful because of fear (beware of forsaken racial   tho)
---
I play on a PvP server and I swear the undead locks get off on fearing Alliance locks, because they can‚Äôt do it back.
---
Thanks for the reply. Given that it's so rare, I dont want to price the shirts too low... do you have any insight on price? Havent played in many years and I'm out of the loop.
---
I‚Äôm sorry, but, this is a horrible video.
---
Yeah because games aren't real so they shouldn't have any effect on our mental state or emotions. Right?
---
I had a shaman today get a windfury proc on his initial swing and another on his stormstrike, hit me 8 times with one attack, half healthed me as a geared to the teeth warrior.
---
I didn't have a mental breakdown, you're just annoying as fuck.
---
It was an amusing story, I enjoyed it :) 
---
Still, IMO the reason for the lack of dedicated tanks is that each guild only needs 2-3.
---
For example in our guild, the 2-3 tanks power leveled to 60 in the first 3 weeks.  Anyone who kept up with them had a glorious time of it, we all had the opportunity to run the pre-bis dungeons 20+ times with an awesome tank, full voice comms etc.  Now that we're two months in, the only thing our tanks need to run 5mans for is reputation grind.  Otherwise they're leveling an alt and will re-appear 7 days later to re-kill Rag.
---
Can't really blame them, it's not exactly fun to grind out money on a tank &amp; what else are they gonna do with their time?    
---
So who's left to tank?  All the good tanks hit pre-bis and stop running dungeons.  The PUG guys have to settle for Arms tanks at 55+, because all the dedicated ones are hibernating til raid reset.
---
Some alts are starting to come online now, but even still, guild only needs 2-3 tanks for the alt run.  So we're gonna have the same problem.  I'm personally rolling a warrior alt, but will be arms til 60 and then fury -- because I'm not being promised a tank spot, so I'm not going to sacrifice for tanking pugs.
---
Only when attacked
---
I prefer to think of it as being a Dad with kids. 
---
You're the Dad and have to tell some of the kids what to do/sheep.
---
You have to keep an eye on your kid's mana incase they need a little drink from their sippy cups.
---
You have to make sure none of the bad men hit your kids.
---
You also need to be a firm dad and discipline your hunter kid when his multishot hits the sheep. Bad kid!
---
When one of your kids pulls for you it should be praised. Good warlock! You pulled it, now you be a big boy and you tank it! That's ma boy! ... Aw it pushed you over. No worries I'll take over. At least you tried.
---
I had some steps to become who I am as world PvPer. First, I didn't attack horde at all, then I was attacked a lot and killed while leveling and being on low hp many times. I decided to get revenge / camp those who attack me first. Then I was attacked by someone I spared, I could end his miserable life with one sinister strike but I let this undead shit live (lol). After that and being attacked mostly by undead cringe lords, I decided to KoS any undead I see, no matter if 30 lvls below or 50. I go for the kill and become satisfied afterwards. This is how it goes. Other than that, I kill every horde while protecting BRS/BRD/Blackrock Mountain/Onyxia Lair entrance with group or going for herb gathering with horde going same way as me. It's competition and I want to have it out my way. Yesterday I was also ganked in Ungoro crater. Nobody on sight, full respawns, Devilsaurs wandering around. I solo devilsaur as Rogue using evasion tanking / adrenaline rush combo, I kill it (just for challenge, didn't know if I can do that, I don't have skinning), take loot and boom, sapped. Two undead rogues out of stealth going for skinning, then they vanish. I hate undeads but really wouldn't expect people to camp in Ungoro in stealth just to take one devilsaur leather LOL. They would be better off farming gold pickpocketing. I even tried to chase after them and almost killed one with FAPs help but he did prep vanish. I don't even know what the hell was that.

Im currently a 28 mage. I would like to do raid content but am not a hardcore gamer. My work schedule is night heavy and for the most part I cant make every tues/thurs raid time consistently. I work in the service industry so its not feasible for me to be there for every raid all the time.  I want to find a guild that would be open to me filling in random slots when I can. I know I wont have priority over gear or things like that, but I love the game and have been playing for over a decade. I just want to experience end game content, honestly. I'd love to get myself a geared toon, but thats not really the goal. Are there guilds that are okay with something like that or should I just accept that I'll only experience dungeon content? I'm on thunderfury currently, I'd be down to realm transfer for a guild that would help me do some endgame content despite my work schedule. I'd love to play WoW and raid consistently, RL doesnt always allow it though :/
---
Man, the server I was on in Vanilla saw these rules, shredded them then lit them on fire.

A wave means you are going to die.

A salute, you‚Äôre gonna die.
---
A bow, you‚Äôre definitely going to die.
---
Targeting an opposing player? You are already dead, you just don‚Äôt know it yet.
---
Seeing someone 8 levels above you? You‚Äôre gonna die a lot. Probably time to log out and do some chores!

If a level 48 walks past me first thing I think is 'oh neat, free shard'

The chances are slim, but if my Elemental Mastery Chain Lightning and Earth Shock hit, I can punch up quite a bit. Of course shamans are kind of fucked if their strongest burst is resisted or misses.

This farm isn‚Äôt really worth it. Like another posted indicated Xn from APES is on over 750 runs (that means 1500+ drake kills) and doesn‚Äôt have it yet, although he has seen a lot of them with the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù affixes.

I'd love to tie a string with a couple of helium balloons around a gnome mage's neck. Watch that ugly little midge go floating up into the sky in a split second. He tries to untie the string but it's too late, he's already too far, he realises that if he were to do so he would splat on the ground, a bloody midge pulp, since he forgot to get light feathers. Just leave him there in the sky, his little legs kicking. See how far the midge can go, has a midge ever been into space before? Further and further he goes until he reaches the upper parts of the atmosphere, then his tiny midge head starts expanding as he lets out a high pitch wheeze... then POP!
---
Spriest puts up a good fight. Especially as either dwarf or undead.

Hi everybody,

I was just wondering how those two weapons compare to each other, when used by a dwarf Hunter:

---
I know that slower weapons are usually better, but I cannot find any information on the fireball effect of the gun (proc chance, hidden CD). 
---
Also, what does the dwarven racial weapon skill gives in numbers?
---
Yeah, of course you don't run it in group settings, that would be a horrible idea - but this thread was about solo content, right?

The other night i was running WC and I was on the verge of falling asleep. On the second chest we came accross, i rolled a 90. Given my previous 4 and the overrall atmosphere of the group, i jokingly shit-talked and bragged about my roll. 
---
Sadly I didn't notice our healer's last-minute 92. Thankfully the lad was chill and didn't really give a damn. I offered to give him the green cloak that i got but he wasn't interested. I've had a couple of bad experiences, but many more great ones. I love this game.

50% advantage on my server. Posts like this are so cringey when Horde have such hugh numbers advantage and gank relentlessly, I have absolutely no sympathy for them.

1) if they are horde 2) are not grey 3) bonus rule, I refuse to corpse camp.
---
critical and quasi-academic perspective
---
I can‚Äôt take this seriously
---
I‚Äôm horde side on a PvP server and I can 100% confirm that for you;my guild is half forsaken for this one racial I swear.
---
What class are you, rogue?
---
What are you talking about? I understand how +5 swords works in pvp. I am saying its entirely worthless when compared to how good stun resist is in pvp.
---
Upvoted for the font.
---
You can do hybrid Ele/Resto (used for pvp)... You don't get elemental mastery but you do get nature's swiftness.
---
Yea, love seeing these "lfm 2dps 1 heal 1 tank for scholo, half the instance reserved" messages
---
No I kill them in 2 pulls. For the first pull I open the graves at the entrance, then blink to the graves at the left side and open the first 5 graves... and with the second pull I open the rest of the graves..
---
I rolled a Hunter to snipe them from the bushes with Aimed Shot.
---
Torta must be so worried.
---
I would use an add on like Auctionator to help you price them, or look into other color rare shirts and see if they‚Äôre selling on the AH and for how much for insight on that.
---
If you‚Äôre in a guild, I‚Äôd also make it known to your guild mates that you can make them, to help spread word of mouth.
---
15 years ago I took up engineering and learned how to make mechanical squirrels. That schematic easy and basic enough, but I earned plenty of money just through my guild mates tipping me for making them one (they‚Äôd supply the mats).
---
Now that I'm getting solidly geared as a warrior I'm looking forward to finally checking some names off my shitlist. But the issue is it's a lot of mages, and that's a matchup i just don't feel ready to go at alone.

Yes, I forgot to add that to the original post.

Well first off the general population will go down most likely. Second is you would preferably need/have gear from MC/Ony so the effective player pool for pugs is just smaller. And while it‚Äôs not too hard it‚Äôs definitely harder than MC. Some lesser coordinated pugs that have the ability to clear most of MC might get stumped by Razorgore or not have enough dps for Vael. Could be wrong though, just my thoughts.

Yeah it‚Äôs soo hard to get a group for it right you deserve it

you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about at all. You can heal any instance without issue as an off spec healer prior to raids.

Hahahah amazing

Fire becomes Godmode on Loatheb in NAXX =)

Yeah you are we're still having fun!
---
Wiping the raid ? Oh you mean using a few charges and then quickly changing to another clip ? Are you actually this much of a tool or just acting ?
---
I think there are a lot of people in your situation, so there should be guilds that cater to them.

Make BRD your new home for journey to 60.

Plus when you are 60 from dungeons all quests that would have given XP will give bonus gold.
---
Thanks, may the winds guide you!
---
For frodo.
---
Sorry, i have hard time believing "150+ runs". You would have been level 60 looong ago.
---
But i do agree on attitude toward tanks. I met a dickhead once, but everybody in party agreed on him being a dickhead. There are people who, well, make non-optimal decisions. Peopel also die. Party may wipe. But i don't remember being blamed for it as a tank. Even if it was my fault - like failing to spot a patrol in Mara.

Ok, thanks for the answer. I'll check it out as well!

Please let me know if it works just as described because by reading it and looking at the pictures, it's pretty awesome. (I don't have access to my game atm) Thank you

This would work in mop when you got bladestorm if you sneaked in with all cds

Blessings of Cenarius upon you in return!

I just turned lvl 30 warrior with berserker stance and got some help to retrieve the whirlwind axe. I am arms spec and just got swepping strikes as well. I am a bit confused how my dps rotation should be now and would love to hear some advice.
---
I charge in with battle stance
---
Apply rend and then switch to berserker stance to spam sunder armor/heroic strike and finish off target with execute below 20% hp? Do I switch back to battle stance to do overpower? Or do I just stay battle stance 30-36 until I get whirlwind?
---
Thanks in advance!
---
Trust me, you would not want to see these sweaty nerds naked.
---
I have no sympathy for tanks with a victim complex.
---
Look into their problems and it's always "first world" type of problem. "**Hey I do way too many dungeons so I have vastly more knowledge and experience than the DPSers and I have to lead**".
---
Yeah buddy, it's because you instantly find groups and finish runs in the time it takes DPSers to put up one group. You're way more experienced. Not to mention that you blow through the entire gearing process in a few of days then expect special privileges because you graced the group/raid with your presence.
---
Who has ever flamed a tank and then proceeded to continue the run with that tank? At the slightest insult they just leave. And they'll find a new full group before you find a replacement for them.
---
I've seen more than enough tanks at 60 just rush to a certain boss, kill it, and if they don't get their loot they just leave. Nothing said in party, and when you whisper them they either ignore or tell you they don't need the rest of the dungeon.
---
Now what can you do? Blacklist a tank? That's like downvoting a post with 100k upvotes. They're already in another group doing the same dungeon while your group disbands because you couldn't find another tank for 20 mins.
---
Dont know, but I Just realised again that Moonkin really have super bad reputation
---
honestly ffs i'm tired of this hugcraft bullshit if i see a hordie i assume we just have a mutual agreement to kill eachother
---
The game‚Äôs opposing factions are literally in a war. If this dude thinks that killing enemies in war, even when you have an advantage, is wrong, then dude is not suited to real life. Shit has happened since the dawn of time.
---
Dude you are such a cock sucker. You are either part of apes or you are just a HUGE ass licker. These videos have nothing amazing in them.
---
Plate has the highest repair bills, and dies first in dungeons if tanking. 
---
Overall I would say more expensive since they are also more difficult to level.
---
Man that's always been my playstyle too. I always topped the death charts but if you wanna win you gotta make sacrifices.
---
Hi, I'm J and I'm an altaholic.
---
60 paladin, 37 priest, 31 hunter, 28 warrior, 27 mage, 25 warlock.
---
The mage only tops dmg if you do big pulls with breaks inbetween for mana.
---
If you chainpull 1 pack at a time meles does more dmg. It really all comes down to what best fits your group.
---
That's not a Nemesis Skullcap.
---
Mhm, didnt thought about that, yes
---
You can also do Ashenvale but there‚Äôs quite a bit of running back and forth involved.
---
i Spit on people of the same faction killing lowies or doing 2-3vs1
---
Video violence causes games.
---
It certainly is implemented.
---
There's so much competition for aoe spots that most mages are the three mob mages lol
---
TBH this is the main problem I see too playing a warrior for the first time and it's the reason I try to DPS unless we can't find another tank.   
---
Being rage starved sucks, and it really feels like sometimes other players either don't know, or worse, don't care how it works and just go hell for leather regardless.   
---
At first I tried different things to see if it would help such as switching between stances , switching weapons, different abilities, different openers.   
---
In the end I just gave up for the most part.. any "tanking" I do is mainly just me with a 2h spamming sunder armor and switching to sword and board only if we get a bunch of adds.
---
That's why you did GDKP runs instead. Get 10 fully geared, skilled raiders, 10 mediocre geared with a decent amount of gold in their pocket and 5 fresh lvl 80 alts that are rich as fuck.
---
People use the gold they brought as DKP and the winner of an item pays into the pot. At the end of the raid, the pot is split equally. The carries get to earn a bunch of gold, rich people get to gear their alts, anyone who didn't win something has more gold to spend the next week.
---
I got rich as fuck running those back in Wrath. Whenever DBW or ToC trinkets dropped, it was awesome to just lean back and watch the pot tripple in size off of just one item
---
&lt;Faithe&gt; represent!
---
I also must know
---
You completely missed what I was getting at. I could care less about when Blizzard decides to add in the QoL stuff, if they added in the keyring from launch I wouldnt have cared. I personally wish they had released each phase with accurate itemization and talents for their respected patches but I am not even remotely talking about that at all.
---
I was just pointing out how the OP was whining about not having a feature right now that wasn't added in until way late in the game originally. This is the same as if the OP was complaining about not having BWL or ZG available right this instance too or class epic mounts. We will get features whenever Blizzard wants to.
---
Classic is what it is right now. People need to just enjoy it for what it is, not complain about every little minor QoL that hasn't come out yet. My complaint is people shitting on the game for what it's not instead of just enjoying what we have been given so far and be grateful with whatever is added when it is.
---
We have just witnessed the birth of true greatness right here with this comment.
---
Exploiters.
---
God don‚Äôt play dead by daylight then. That circle is in every game of it.
---
Its faster in general but not faster than all questing (ungoro/wpl/searing gorge have some insane exp/hour questing). 
---
But its faster than the vast majority of questing. 
---
At 33 id suggest arathi highlands. If you play during offhours you should be alone there. If your not alone at the spot your exp/hour will probboly not be much higher than normal questing.
---
I mean, they could but, like, why?

---
Back in the TBC days, I used to go with my friends to darkshire, we were wearing tuxedos, level 70, had some fancy guns and the Eye of flame. You know.. looking fancy.
---
Then we were "hunting" low levels, hitting them with gun for 300dmg per hit, with invis and speed potions to make the fun exciting. It was fun because ti took always like 2-3 hits to kill an ally. Of course once 70 came we went the fuk away because we were tank and healer, so once one dude 70 with high resilience gear showed up.. oh boi.. gotta run fast.
---
Woah, this thread is so weird... I just saw a random thread about STV and randomly remembered this island. Then I suddenly see this thread about it! Wtf...
---
Yeah, I think that was it. TBH I've only read a couple of the books, since Blizzard is one of those companies where *literally everyf&amp;\*king thing* is considered canon, and I don't even bother to keep up. That one was pretty good, though.

I went there in TBC for the oil, it's been a relevant location up till Sunwell.
---
For once, I can agree with an Alliance.
---
Id go with 11/0/40. 
---
No fight in raids is so long as to make you need that extra manaregen from arc anyway. 
---
And aoegrinding without ice barrier is a pain in the ass.
---
Oil?
---
The summary panel doesn't stay once you move it. And it takes a couple tries to get it record profession data. I also have a robust UI, there could possibly be some conflicting addons. It's late, I'm going to play around with it some more tomorrow. Thanks.
---
I'll second that!
---
Distract is one of the best utility abilities in the game. Fits the class perfectly and enables stealth gameplay in different ways (sneaking past higher level mobs, pickpocket setup, allows you to pull mobs without aggroing adds, ofcourse fucks with the heads of players in pvp and can even help you re-stealth when being chased right after being de-stealthed by gaining extra distance etc). Absolutely love it.
---
BWL has a few bosses that requires some coordination from the whole raid or have some "more difficult than the basic" mechanics.
---
You would be astonished by the number of guild that couldn't clear BWL on Pserver because they were too dumb to understand simple mechanics.
---
My motto is to simply never go to Desolace at all... way too depressing!
---
The drama potential with 40 man raids and loot council gets a hard pass.  Even if its not corrupt just people perceiving it or getting jealous would be a headache.  Most people won't accept why that one mage is getting mageblade assigned and they aren't getting it instead.  Less efficient definitely but way less drama.  Don't have to worry about gear checks for a long time in classic.

This is the kargoz video the guy was talking about

https://youtu.be/tOcqrIfi0qI
---
Super in depth. Anyone that wants to min/max a hunter should watch that. Your gears pretty solid 
---
Get the true strike shoulders from ubrs first boss. That would put you at 7% hit, Even at 7% hit like the other dude mathed out for you, with a 20/31/0 build, max fr resistance / Stam build for your pet you should pull between 200-300 dps over a long mc fight.
---
Hunters are some of the best phase 1 dps but you have to know how to use your rotation proper and not clip your shots like another guy mentioned. Get a swing timer addon, what he means by ‚Äúclipping‚Äù (for example) is casting ure aim shot right as it‚Äôs off cd and replacing it with wha would have been a auto shot that was about to cast. That kargoz video goes over it with what he dubs the ‚Äúpendulum effect‚Äù.

I've never had issues with DPS as a healer. The trick is to make them know that you won't heal them if they do something stupid by never giving them enough heals.
---
Sappers are fun, but they are kinda OP and i dont really like to see them used in these scenarios. Most of the time the ones getting sappers off end up wiping the other raid. I would like to see more fights without sappers used to be honest.

There was a discussion (yet again) a few days ago about Dal'Rends vs Peacemaker for hunter prebis. People kept defending Dal'Rends over Peacemaker because 'it's on muh prebis list'. Despite the fact that people pointed out that agility enchants weren't in the game yet, so Peacemaker was strictly better. The response came back to "but... but... muh prebis list".
---
In conclusion, people are fucking stupid.

Oh hey, a fellow Tibia player. Fancy meeting you here.

Why would blizzard change this though?

I mean crusader will definitely be the best enchant. Its sort of a lesser version of Destiny's proc.  Remember to focus bt when and if you can when Destiny price because it gives you 400 AP for your bloodthirst damage. As for talents: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/20305011332-05052005025010051
---
For Raids, there is not nearly as big demand for tanks. You only need 1-5 Tanks for a 40 man raid. For Dungeons, Tanks are always in short demand and much more sought after than healers.
---
Altoholic is bring developed for classic. Author has confirmed they're working on it.
---
Then go to northend and talk to the lich king :p
---
You would be angry and desperate for a free win - even if it's a cheap, small victory, if you had to corpse run every 5 minutes, too.
---
The bonus from Berserker Stance is minimal when leveling, so I would stay in Battle Stance until you get whirlwind.
---
Its hard for people to quit without making a big drama, just uninstall and leave.

When was the last sociology study you read that was based on behavior in video games? 
---
Think back on all the most cited studies you‚Äôve (hopefully, with the way you talk about hUmAnItY) read regarding the way people behave when they have power over others. The powerful participants are _always_ either directly affecting, or made to think they‚Äôre directly affecting, the weak participants in a *real, measurable, and harmful* way. 
---
This is because they know that if the participants know the harm is simulated, they lose restraint and the study becomes meaningless. 
---
If you‚Äôre gonna be all, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 17 and we live in a society..‚Äù then at least focus on things that actually indicate how people behave in real life. This game has nothing to do with morality.

Drama queen, unzubbing over a 'rare' pet that every hunter has. Good one.

---
You wanted it. Nobody expects to watch a movie again to see a different ending.
---
Your question; not guaranteed, but there is a chance. Every GM has his own decisions about taking care of your "user fault" abandoned pets. Their job is not restoring abandoned pets.
---
I never said they were or had to stick to the original patches. My point was to show we need to accept the game as it is. Not complain about how it's unfair we dont have this one feature right now that wasn't added in til later originally. Blizzard controls this game and will release stuff as they see fit. Until such time as they release any specific feature, players just need to enjoy the game for what it is, not come complain on reddit because keys take up a couple extra bag slots. Players back in Vanilla had to deal with it then and I have no sympathy for players today who cant deal with it.
---
How do you think all the war machines run?
---
Your pet seems confused.

As not the tank you don't see the whispers tank get. Also the difference of tanking 1-60 now and tanking 1-60 on release is drastically different.

It depends, usually yes, having too much developper on the same system you are building is counterproductive.
---
But it's not quite the issue here, they choose to recreate vanilla within the Legion client, the main challenge was making sure that all the quirk and features from the vanilla client could be transferred with the Legion client. Basically that's alot of little small thing to test and recreate and you need ALOT of manpower to do that properly.
---
Just wanted to make a note that I totally agree with you man. The community is the same shitty core it's always been, no "classic magic" can wipe that away. Have I had some awesome social experiences since launch? Hell ya! But the guy running in and stealing my mobs while grouping for a big aoe pull tonight was the last straw. As was the people joining  group until they get their item then it's peace out in the middle of a dungeon. And so on... It's endemic of a larger disrespect for your fellow player that seems to be so prevalent nowadays. Cancelled my sub right after. Oh well November is a good month for console gamers.
---
If you have gear completely focused on extra healing stats and mp5 (extra mana per 5 seconds stat) its fairly easy to do.
---
If you're healing in gear for shadow spec, or some kind of hybrid build, no. Aa someone else mentioned you will heavily slow the gory down and have to drink after every fight.
---
Thanks for the reply.
---
When I reach 36 and get whirlwind, do I ever change back to battle stance to overpower or is it a waste of rage?
---
Okay, now we're getting a *bit* too far üò≥
---
Unless you are on Rattlegore, I am afraid that will never happen.
---
yeah, idk about this being a big deal dude. it hadn‚Äôt started yet and if you‚Äôre flying that way you could just find another group. call me an ass but i‚Äôd give priority spots for friends/players i know well any time (well, unless a run has already started or is literally just about to).
---
It‚Äôs the same thing with games these days. One of my friends I met playing CS a few months ago kept insisting to me that CS was a dead game then the next day they hit their highest concurrent player count ever. I don‚Äôt understand why people think whatever they don‚Äôt like anymore or don‚Äôt play on is ‚Äúdead‚Äù.
---
That attitude doesn't actually exist. Either these posts are all fabrication or these people are playing tank so poorly that 3 dps would rather be sitting in LookingforGroup than trying to succeed with them
---
4. Are gnome makes, fuck those Jokerd wannabees man!
---
Yea for me it was the only type of mouse you could literally rest your hand/arm on your pillow with no mouse pad and never have to move a muscle. The best thing there super cheap and reliable for the most part if you take care of them. Logitech is a solid brand, and the only one I‚Äôve tried.
---
Blizzard are fascists
---
There‚Äôs absolutely nothing wrong with making an addon to some of the boring legwork of putting together a party. Ive met many people I put on my friends list hat way.
---
If you are an alli dont put anything on it you will get better.
---
ELI5: Threat addons are blind in vanilla, due to game API. Other players have to use that addon too to share their threat data.
---
I mean just giving ret crusader strike would solve all the problems with ret and still keep it from being homogeneous.
---
DM doesn't necessarily need to be a patch, they should just be able to toggle a flag serverside. We'll see this week.
---
Honestly I think the bis list is wrong. I just got gloves, boots and shoulders. I have pre raid bis in every single slot. When I equip those 3 items i do loose 8 frost sp. However, I gain more than a thousand mana, 10 mp5 or smth. Resistance, 600 health, some spirit. Now ask yourself. Is the 8 FROST sp really worth it? Might give you slightly higher dps on 1 fight but over an entire raid you will perform a lot better with the t1 pieces. Now that said, once I obtain more t1 I might have to requip my hands of power or smth. 
---
But the point is this, the bis list is not a 100% and you can prioritize different things. Dont be afraid to play around with it.
---
Tanking just sucks unless you have a guild backing you.
---
My daily grind right now is this: log on, get whispers asking to tank emp runs from some 56 druid who is healing but intends to roll on HoJ if it drops (and yes, I lost HoJ to a pug resto druid).  Wait for guildies to come on to see who wants to do what, if anything.  Fingers crossed we can run something because it will be smooth, but likely won't advance my character for dps or tanking gear.  Then spend 3 hours waiting to get into an UBRS pug where all of the dps are 58 and rolling on dps and tanking gear...
---
So I spec'd fury.  Now it takes 4 hours to get into pugs because none of the melee want to compete for gear, and about half the time the group leader asks me if I can tank anyhow... because you know... no one wants to tank (including the tanks that sign up to tank).
---
I hope not, that mountain is insanely cool the first time you get up there with max settings on.
---
Yet in my unempirical anecdote, it's the other way around.
---
Yea the classes aren‚Äôt even close to balanced haha.

For what it's worth, I don't want Classic expansions, I want Classic+
---
I also want to genocide the undead.

It is in the game

i want to know aswell
---
Literally this rofl..
---
Yeah content rollout is a bit slow for a lot of people. They've gotten their epic mount, all their gear from dungeons and MC was cleared a long time ago.
---
Personally I'm fine with it because I always enjoyed farm a lot more than progress.
---
Have you tried standing/walking in the middle of the huts?
---
I don't know how it is for warriors, but for hunters it apparently can be a great farm spot. Solo tribute runs I think?
---
When people still play world of Warcraft because they‚Äôre fucking ridicolous nerds that don‚Äôt care about human rights

im literally right next to the bonfire which is in the middle
---
We had an impatient mage doing this in BRD last night. Constantly pulling while I was recovering mana... just chill dude. Wiped us twice with that shit.
---
look up the icy veins arms leveling guide.
---
Yeah i've seen that aswell. But I'm trying to find the best gear on my own and to me that guide doesn't look like the best. Wrong boots etc, feels like a low-budget guide.
---
Warriors and their god complex, tale as old as the game itself.
---
Assuming you have Tactical Mastery you can swap immediately for overpower and back as you should have enough stored rage for it to matter.

Has the picture been cropped to hide the 2 others they always come with??
---
Maybe dont play nonstop.
---
Few people understand 'threat management', or simply don't care. They want to kill as fast as possible. I'm a resto druid but I have tank a few dungeons in feral while levelling and honestly, it was a horrible experience.
---
Cool another thread with a tank whinging about being a tank.
---
That sounds like me and hoj, except it still hasn‚Äôt dropped.
---
I asked for a group in general to do the Tanaris chicken escort quest, got in a group with a guy, we waited for the chicken to respawn then the cunt started the escort before I even turned in the initial quest. I followed him for a while until I saw two allies go by, I waved at them and pointed at the guy trying to get them to kill him but they killed me instead, so then I spent the next 5 hours making sure no allies could do the escort by hiding and attacking them when the 3 mob ambushes spawn.
---
Depends on your talents. Usually your talent tree by now gives you 50% extra crit chance on overpower and you also keep 25 rage after switching - so yes, overpower
---
A good tank makes a good pug
---
/s?
---
Man people who like to gank always seem to be the biggest, easiest to trigger, snowflakes.
---
&gt; If you‚Äôre dedicated to leveling via dungeons, don‚Äôt just say ‚ÄúI‚Äôll heal‚Äù to get groups faster. The healer really helps set the pace for the dungeon. 
---
I heal every dungon I do as full retribution spec. Just put on healing gear and you're good to go. Any healer that needs to be heal specced sub-60 is just not a very good healer to begin with.
---
actually, he took a screenshot of the photo he took with his phone. I don't even.

Trickle down hatenomics
---
Sounds like that bitch mage had it coming.
---
At what level are we drawing the line?
---
No one cares if u quit. Did you not get enough attention from your parents as a kid?
---
This is why I play on a normal server
---
People that leveling always see "LFM mages to spellcleave XXX". Then rerolls to mages. Weeks after, because of mage surplus, people look for non-caster ranged DPS etc.
---
If you are playing this game for fun, just do whatever you want. Mage is a good class to both grind &amp; progress. Good choice over other spellcasters.
---
The term quit itself is dramatic
---
I've played WoW before but it was so damn long ago. Most of the dungeons I do recall a bit but not in their entirety. I'll say one thing to your last paragraph because this resonates with me in the beginning but I'd like to offer a counter-point
---
&gt; After 15 years of WoW I have like no orientation on WC, Maraudon or BRD, because as a DPS you simply follow the lead while watching a movie

My main is a rogue - my first run in BRD was exactly like this. I followed the lead .. but .. I also tried to memorize things about the dungeon because otherwise I would have learned nothing and rely on others to know things. The second run a day later I had some locations nailed down of where bosses are, what path to take and where quest items are. Led the group to a boss no one knew exactly where to find anymore and finished a Shadowforge Key quest for someone because they didn't know where to turn it in. The third run I led the party myself and we navigated through the dungeon with no issue.
---
Especially as DPS I try - or even have - to memorize what things work on what bosses because it can mean a caster's or tank's life potentially. That might be CC that might be kicks / interrupts in general. Managing my cooldowns efficiently while knowing which boss I need them on. That's muscle memory for me now - it just happens as I play because I pay attention. That's maybe not for everyone and some people might exactly be like you described in that last paragraph and simple don't want to give their full attention. If that causes the group an issue ( more adds, impatient pulls, etc. ) it will be noticed I'm sure. Even if that does happen I don't condemn someone for one mistake or even two if it's by accident but in a group you have to rely on the other people on doing their part in carrying the dungeon together with you and if I cannot rely on that then we're a person short in mind.
---
I did enough mistakes in dungeons because maybe I forgot / overlooked a patrol or opening a quest item spawns a mob but that's also part of learning. I apologize for those mistakes and try to play better. Most parties will be sympathetic if you clearly know you did something wrong especially if causes a wipe.
---
I realize this is not exactly on-topic of the OP or your bear experience but I also think that DPSing and Tanking go so much hand in hand to make a dungeon run a good experience.
---
What would be more gold/hr? Just straight up lasher farming solo or 2man with a tank?
---
Can do both, since i'm a holy nova priest with a tank buddy.
---
You use T1 head, T1 wrists and T1 boots.
---
Depends on the server, usually tanks are in higher demand for dungeons. Raids only need 1-2 tanks though, and most guilds already have their tank; that being said, as a tank, you can easily gear up your pre-raid BiS for the dps role

Just as a reminder: This guy thought we should just give every person on earth a few bitcoins, since bitcoins are just "generated out of nothing", this would completely solve poverty globally.

---
1) Desolace is **HUGE**.  
---
2) Desolace is a sub-40 zone.
---
1) + 2) = PITA
---
So playing within the boundaries of the game makes you a shitty person?.....ok
---
Imagine having an elitist attitude about video game points.
---
It‚Äôs my duty to kill alliance, but it‚Äôs my pleasure to kill gnomes
---
You think Quel'serrar outdo MC/Onyxia weapons?
---
It's always ally's too.
---
I saw an ally about to die and pulled his mob and helped him kill it. 
---
An ally waited for me to almost down a mob, stun locked and killed me to take the tag.
---
If you are specced for swords then you want to look for slower weapons with a higher hit range over faster daggers which don‚Äôt hit as hard. Since combat is an easier levelling experience in questing most go down the swords route and look for slow big hitting weapons.
---
you need a hug? you seem to have a bad day
---
Believe me, I try to do my best as a DPS (that movie thing was maybe a bit exaggerated) and as Lock this means in case of emergency I fear with /focus for Curse of Recklessness, I focus my damage on the skull, I drink/eat instead of waiting for a heal, I put my SS on the healer and look out for the cooldown, I run to the tank in case of aggro, I pull aggro on purpose if the Healer is being attacked and I watch out for pats and other unwanted pulls. 
---
But this still is completely chilled and laid compared to running the instance as a tank.
---
the fuck did you just say
---
Took some group photos with him, he's a chill orc.
---
I just replied to a shadow priest asking the same question, so I just link to that comment [here](/r/classicwow/comments/dh8fdk/daily_questions_megathread_october_13_2019/f3p3ky3/)
---
&gt; Priest always shielded me on the pull, even after I whispered him 3 times.
---
I have a /cancelaura macro to remove the PW:S.
---
imagine you responding... wait you did, atleast it proves someone cares
---
The response I normally get when pointing out the scumbaggery of that is: "This is a pvp server"
---
Oh. Well carry on then..
---
sometimes while im sitting in lookingforgroup, waiting for party to form, etc, i just run around killing lowbies in questing areas where both faction needs the mobs, so it helps my faction. might as well
---
What
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but Shadow Weaving was done by a Priest full +heal gear spamming deranked Mindflay for max stack then general healing others when needed and not DPSing. Was not a true Shadow Priest with relevant gear l.
---
Jesus here. It's not about the few bad apples. If you tank with a positive attitude and show that a single wipe does not make for a bad run, the group follows suit and generally they are very nice to you.
---
Just make sure you are the raid leader if you're actually leading a raid. You want to be able to kick someone if they are really toxic and ignore every warning. If that ever happens, most of the group will side with you. Because you're the tank.
---
He didn't finish the craft, he cancelled it. So he has all the materials the guild collected.
---
This.
---
I think it‚Äôs good
---
horde dont have storm form :P
---
&gt; It's always ally's too.
---
Yes, if you play Horde, only Alliance characters can gank you.
---
That's how the game works.
---
No, why?
---
But I do
---
They hate us cause they ain't us.
---
I've seen a lot of pugs lately with items on gbid, but still hesitant of joining one simply because they all call it gbid instead of gdkp on my server (usually at ony). Im assuming some pug raidleaders just wanna make some really quick money by grabbing the gold themselves since a lot of players still dont know about gdkp and that this gold should be split up at the end.
---
It's funny how you can immediately know if a DD does have a tank alt/main or not.
---
What phase is ZG?
---
Thanks for the heads up, my main issue is that when I'm playing after work I simply don't want a super-stress run. Everyone relies on the tank to run the show. I played DPS and Heal for many years now and both roles are usually easy-going, even if you don't have a single clue about the whole dungeon (raid, whatever). But the tank is expected to be omniscient.
---
I feel so bad for people joining guilds that use the DKP system, sitting and hoarding your DKP like Gollum hoarding the One Ring.
---
Says the guy agreeing that ‚Äúhumans are basically trash‚Äù.
---
STV isn‚Äôt that bad imo, sure I got ganked a few times but a quick message in general chat and I had a group form up to counter gank or help me quest in peace, give it a shot, if you‚Äôre needing to go back to nesingwary‚Äôs camp just make sure to scout it out as much as you can for the enemy faction
---
&gt;As a horde priest on Faerlina, you alliance guys are really untrusting of my MC fort buffs. Y‚Äôall usually see the cast and try something way too late only to realize you now have more HP and control of your character again. Can‚Äôt we all /hug?
---
Priests quickly become Kill on Sight after experiencing some of the malicious use of MC.
---
I believe it's in 4
---
I did only a handul of quests in STV honestly.. You're not missing out on anything really, the 30-40 gear doesn't matter in the long run, just make sure you have the booty bay flight path it will come handy later on..
---
Because the WoW API does not support it. When an enemy starts to cast a spell, the only information sent by the servers to your client is ‚ÄùX begins to cast Y‚Äù. The cast time has to be guessed by the addon, and is thus inaccurate in many cases.
---
Oh good to know, I didn't knew they were a way to do it with no mount, thanks.
---
lvl 53 Tank Warri here, usually just doing arena runs, but can go further no problem. We did all the way up to grim guzzler, and we only stopped because we started at midnight and it was already 2 pm then. people needed to sleep. We didnt have a single wipe, and everyone was around my level. Dont let people tell you you cant continue after arena.
---
I have a guild that accepts non meta specs but one of each max. So I am their boomie. I Pull my own weight dps wise and offer alot of support here and there during encounters. So yea.... GIMME MY STAFF
---
lol thats awful but he probably didnt know
---
Undead rogues should be a Faction onto themselves
---
Mind helping out a 53 warrior trying to figure gearing up by telling me what is so bad about it?
---
Is the list going for to high of a % hit chance or are they just getting it in the wrong places?
---
[1. General - Hillsbrad Foothills]: [45][Alliance Player]: "Can someone help me I'm being camped by 60's"
---
[1. General - Hillsbrad Foothills]: [Other Alliance Player]: "Whereabouts?"
---
[1. General - Hillsbrad Foothills]: [45][Alliance Player]: "Just outside Tarren Mill"
---
so if a guy just pass near you, it doesnt reset?
---
THEY'RE IN THE FUCKING TREES
---
and on the XP note, you can level all the way to 60 from your level with just instances. Getting your Pre-Raid BIS is important and you can get it all on that way.
---
Thanks for your advice!
---
you just blew my mind
---
can‚Äôt go wrong with Fiery. Cheap or at least way cheaper than Crusader, ads great looks to the weapon as well.

WoW Machinimas, that reminds me things... (like stuff by [Baron Soosdon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnp2kn-QZJE))
---
as a paladin i hated these Kurzen fkers, you got only one interrupt per minute :(
---
I‚Äôm alliance and gnomes are KoS
---
See, my mindset is the complete opposite. I tank because I want to get into groups quick and easy and be able to control the pace of the dungeon on my own.
---
If I fuck up or if the DPS just can't figure out how to slow down on DPS, it's no problem. What are they gonna do, replace me?
---
Show me this in 2 months when all the baby‚Äôs who couldn‚Äôt handle the que hopped ship. Not dedicated players = no players In 2 months always the same trap for these free transfer realms

What the hell are you even talking about are you insane? Different personalities pick different attire/appearances. If you don't think a guy who grows out jet black hair with nose and ear piercings will overwhelmingly have a different personalities than some weeb carrying a waifu pillow you're stupid.
---
Beyond common sense, this is so overwhelmingly proven in studies it isn't even debatable. We have studies that show everything from the color of your car to the speed of your gaze reflect things like your aggression level or your intellectual acumen. Stop being stupid and pretend that a guy picking a male tauren will be the same demographic that picks a female dwarf, your point is completely stupid stop doubling down and being a moron.
---
Storyline!
---
Followed Athene since the old videos from back in the TBC days. He seemed to have really peaked around 2011 with the TogetherToTheTop movement. I do think most of his charity work went towards charity during this time, he was a Razer sponsor and he posted so many videos with various official groups e.g. in the Cape of Africa when he visited.  
---
I've seen this full documentary, and i've seen bits and pieces of information from his own live streams to try and fill in the gaps. What i do know for certain is that him and Rhys have officially setup a "Religion" which he's strongly hinted (although not explicitly) is for tax and legal reasons, because if he's a company he has to comply with all sorts of standard regulations for a business. To a point this makes some sense, to a point it sounds very dodgy.  
---
The part where it gets really strange for me is the fact of how he doesn't pay a proper salary to his employees - people can live in his "Compound" rent free with all bills etc paid for as long as they abide by his "3 hugs a day" rule, convert to veganism and keep a distance from external sources. That's what's swung it for me that there probably is something dodgy going on beyond the "religion" - he's controlling peoples lives through manipulation, although voluntarily at first: there's been people go in/out of his religion that keep going back from what appears to be internal pressure.  
---
The one thing that is making me cast doubt on any of this is the Mia Rose interview - she's said he was hands down of the nicest people she's ever met, and even speaks to him infrequently now. 
---
Also - what happened to his GF? I understand they're no longer together but they're still great friends?
---
I mean, being able to flexibly go from damage dealer to tank in the event of a crash pull or any situation where your healer needs to heal without getting mauled herself seems exactly specialized for the kind of circumstances you're playing in.
---
I tank in retail and was excited to tank in classic. Leveling and tanking dungeons wasn't too bad, but it sure made me go "Please god let this get better at 60" a lot. Turns out it never actually gets better. Tanking sucks at the lower levels and it sucks at max level. I suppose retail spoiled us all with giving tanks the ability to actually tank.
---
I've only ever been flamed once while tanking, and it was when I was solo tanking ubrs. That shit is so fuckin aids to solo tank around the second half. Between that and some people getting mad that I'm not keeping aggro on everything resulting in people dying I ragequit it and haven't done ubrs since. Almost made me quit tanking altogether it was so frustrating.
---
I guess I don‚Äôt use it willy nilly, but I also looked up the definition and realized I didn‚Äôt quite know what it meant.. :) now I feel like I fall sleep into that category for not agreeing with the opinion of Asmons actions.. 
---
‚ÄúYou people‚Äù could be considered to fall under that too though..
---
Wrong, his reset radius omission only like 50-60y ish, you kite him at 41-50 and spam arcane shot.
---
till 56 i quested in WS, ePL and wPL... then i switched to tank. LBRS runs + quest gave a good amount of exp till 57. (3-4 runs) After that i started just doing *FULL* starth runs with guildmembers (60) don't know how it would be with random...the exp you get is crazy... about 40 to 50% per run without quests. But thats just how i did it... there will be other ways aswell. I liked it because i could start farming some pre items for the raids. Good luck and happy leveling mate! =)
---
At 60 it is as you describe. Getting into Molten Core or Onyxia's Lair on a raid night is chaos.
---
Kek spreading misinformation when you're actually 50iq
---
&gt;I could care less
---
If you could care less, that means you care. Do you mean "couldn't care less" or is there a part of this common phrase that I'm misunderstanding
---
Yeah if people reset all the time, sure. Which is a legitimite strategy of course, it's just boring to watch that's all
---
Fear.
---
People hate to invest their time in an unstable system. When they feel there is a chance of a decline that makes the experience worse.
---
They say "this x is ded"
---
this was it, thank you!
---
&gt;like hoarding DKP for trinkets/weapons
---
Basically every ZDKP system has an inherent DKP decay per week to manually decrease hoard incentive. Every week -5% to people in the positives, negatives get that +5% added to their total. Any decent system also has DKP resets when it comes to new raid content; EG, BWL will zero sum back to (0).
---
Flaws? I'm sure there are some, but not anything outside of regular loot woes. For new initiates, there are "trial periods", meaning you cannot roll until you meet the raid attendance criteria (ours is currently two). Compared to having a loot council though, ZDKP is superior in basically every aspect (outside of being the person getting geared feeling awesome, obviously). It's a system that is literally designed to even out loot distribution as evenly, and fairly as possible.
---
&gt; alot of little small thing to test and recreate
---
But that's exactly why "more money being spent" here wouldn't have helped. Respecing didn't really change and worked in retail, so nobody would've tested this even with more resources allocated.
---
Gimping myself playing shadow priest in vanilla, back then and now, but oh god was TBC a welcome addition to shadow.
---
Bonemarrow for life!
---
I mean its up to you.  Not sure about cleave tbh.  I love imp execute for raiding.  Those are pretty minor changes. Booming and blood craze seems like a waste to me though. Especially at 60.
---
It would be even easier without layering by your own logic. Its just thwt everything would be packed to the rim.
---
They have layers to help with questing, not to fit more people on a server. It would be easier to find a group with no layers but the same amount of people than hop layers to find a group.

Pong: 2019 Classic Version
---
Now what is a appropriate reason to unsub?
---
What will razzah88 on Reddit deem worthy?
---
I tanked every single dungeon on my original paladin back in the day and did it equally well in a Holy Shock build and, later, a Holy Shield build. I used a mix of whatever gear was available, really. 
---
Survivability in dungeons was never an issue, don't even worry about it. For AoE threat, use max rank Consecration once and lower ranks thereafter, depending on mana.  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13515/ramsteins-lightning-bolts](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13515/ramsteins-lightning-bolts) is invaluable too; I used this thing for an entire year at least.
---
It helped doing these runs in guild only groups on voice tho. The Arms warrior I routinely did runs with was there to offtank when needed and Holy Shock could effortlessly snap his target back to my paladin if he hadn't made an effort to build threat.
---
Consecration, Bolts and Holy Shield, however, was a lot of insta-threat and once we had geared up sufficiently in these dungeons, there was no visible difference in tanking the undead dungeons and the BRDs.
---
He was good enough to know that every weapon is a hunter weapon
---
Why would it? I imagine it only resets if someone else gets on their aggro table.
---
Nah their job is customer service. Which includes restoring lost pets.
---
The World ahead...
---
I swear I got the shittest Warlock pet names
---
Not pictured - he came from Undercity and had pvp off.

Our tanks prostitute themselves out to parties reserving everything that drops that isnt bis for someone. Makes a ton of cash that way.

Depending on the economy, shards can have a higher value than just the vendor price.

If you have a questing partner you can start ungoro around 50 or 51. 
---
You can also do St at 50 is you have a competent group like all guildies. 
---
I‚Äôd stay in Tenaris and grind it out to 50 then do these two things. If you‚Äôre on US alliance Westfall I can quest with you in Ungoro
---
Update: Got in touch with blizzard. They will solve it in game no problem.
---
So what did I learn from this thread? You guys are pretty pathetic and always wrong.
---
I didn‚Äôt see anywhere he mentioned leveling. Also, its +5 for swords and maces as a human. And the sword spec works great for leveling too. Also assuming you would do dungeons while leveling it worked great. So yes, if you are asking if you are at a disadvantage for not using a sword. The answer is still yes.
---
Does that work for a hunter? I used it before on pservers and it did. 
---
Also, got it at 57? Nice!
---
tell me more while you downvote me to try to sell your gutrippers to people who think its good
---
are you fucking dense? i just told you i've already been killed by a rogue while in a city. by it's already happening i'm referring to people being ganked in towns

How?

But we allready have features from end vanilla.. why not keyring.

But your pet isn't lost. You've abandoned it.

I loved gdkp runs back in icc. Made some gold, got to start learning the ropes for raiding in an environment that people expected atleast a couple of people to be newbies. Met some pretty cool people. Was pretty funny when some kid decided to keep the pot and ended up being on the entire servers shit list after that.

why?

because i can control the pace, i hate tanks that wait 10 hours before each pull,

i can assign marks and dictate the kill targets,

basically i am the puppetmaster in every pug and it is even accepted

so i m good with that

Keep doing Maraudon or ZF until lvl.51

Despressolace is spot on. What a joy it is there
---
I agree as a guild I would prefer the staff goes to a class that would most augment the raid dps. But that idea should not apply for any pickup group, the moonkin deserves their bis just as the mages. Because how often does a raid invites more than 0-2 moonkin? The OP might not be able to find/join another PUG capable of going that far for a chance to roll again.
---
link perhaps. most things here are linked to small clips
---
not if youre a warrior, its not :D
---
You can do ZF GY runs until you‚Äôre 52, then spam mara til your 54-55, then spam BRD arena anger golem until you‚Äôre 60z. When you get 58 or so you can start big boy dungeons like strat scholo as well.
---
Personally not a fan of stance macros besides equipment change, but sure, that could work for you. Just be careful since WW can delay overpowering
---
Joli :)
---
Yeah, and that's great! That was the point I was trying to make :D
---
Now is probably the time. I'm around that level. Tanking without any points in prot is brutal in the 50's.
---
I'm torn on how many points to go and what to sacrifice but I'm about the same level and I *really* need that one point in improved shield block at the very least.
---
I think I'm not gonna go deep prot yet, and stay Arms for now.
---
But the sacrifices are big. Gotta lose improved Overpower. One way or the other gotta lose the crit from Axe Spec or Crualty. 
---
Oddly, Mortal Strike doesn't hurt too much to lose as I'm duo leveling with a priest, can pull a few mobs, but still don't usually find the rage to use both WW and MS. 
---
Between the loss of Improved Overpower and MS it's gonna cripple my PvP burst potential, but that's the trade I think I'll have to make until I can get those talents back as I approach 60.
---
I hope you‚Äôre not on an android of Apple phone!

Ah yes, when you can't make a good point, throw insults.

Buddy, you're wrong, and I'm not going to waste any more of my time explaining it to you.  I fucking love when some idiot on the web thinks he can explain to me the field I work in.
---
My exact first thought as I saw the picture.
---
With Mara. Is that full clears or just princess runs?
---
Pro tip. Assist targeting is set to F by default. Click the tank and then click F to attack the same mob the tank is attacking.

People remember the the worst experiences, and forget about the good ones. That's totally normal. Of course the OP is exaggerating, but there is some truth to it. Tanking for pugs is unrewarding. Some groups are just not fun to tank for - but the same goes for healing and dpsing. Sometimes the tank is just shit and doesn't build any aggro at all (starting to heal at 50% tank hp and drawing aggro from 2 mobs after 1 heal), or doesn't mark ANY targets (and no, that IS the tank's job, not the party leader's) and blame the dps for not focusing, or sometimes the healer ONLY heals the tanks and says "if dps gets any damage it's their own fault), or healers don't dispel AT ALL. That's ok, I'm fine with having 50% less attack speed for 15 minutes. Sometimes your dps does less damage than your tank, and sometimes they're afk for 5+ minutes at a time without warning.
---
It's just that tanks and healers get called out more, even if they don't make more mistake than others. Also, if someone says "dps is shit", they could mean any of the 3 dps in the party, but if someone says "tank is shit", everyone knows they're talking about only 1 person. Best thing is to just ignore toxic people, go on with the dungeon, or in the absolute worst case just leave. Then go on with your life.
---
Thankfully, the vast majority of my dungeon runs (as healer and dps) have been very enjoyable, with nice people, and so far I only had 1 real douchebag in my groups. There's a huge difference between retail and classic, at least on my realm (EU-Razorfen).
---
You can do a full clear your first run for the sceptre and trinket quest (bis for prot), then spam princess
---
A lone undead against the might of the Alliance?

Reserve runs should not be master loot, end of story. Whoever reserved something just needs it and everyone passes.

Feralas is gonna be a bitch in about 24 hours though, just saying.

And pre bis ring for healers.
---
It was also a money sink in tbc. 1k for normal flying and 5k for epic. Also you got flying at 70 so you still had to level up through the world. If they decided to remake the areas which you could only access by flying i wouldnt mind to not have it. But at the same time its not a big deal at least for me.
---
Are you outraged?
---
Just cancelled my Wow Classic Sub
---
Also flying didnt kill pvp in tbc. There was plenty of Wpvp when i played TBC back in a day.
---
Well i am new as well , those 2 weapons are very close and whatever y pick wont diffr a lot from the other one . But because it is a close call and y have a racial go with the gun , it maybe doesnt give stats but its a bit faster and when they have pretty much the same dmg go for dmg over time ...Death to alliance
---
Nice shot! Thats why I don't play on PvP Realms anymore.
---
Can someone tell me the raid ui addon's name?
---
True, but the 30's are the worst. A Crusader enchant could really help pass the time.
---
I've always wished that blizz made it so that you could only PvP if you were the right level for that zone. So STV, yeah you might be 35 and get ganked by a level 42, but that's just they way it is. You wouldn't get a level 50+ ganking because they wouldn't be able to. I know this creates a few issues, but at least every zone would have a roughly 10 level difference MAX between players.
---
forget the itemization - if we had the old talent trees right now MC wouldn't be such a pushover.
---
So after trying your macro in game, it seems to work fine what I'm confused about is the wording, so for clarity; "Rank 2 and Rank 4 casts work fine. It's the SHIFT modifier that doesn't work."  "\[mod:shift\] Shadow Word: Pain(Rank 4)"
---
Oh right. Fiery Blast is also a really fun enchant to put on a lowbie white weapon for alts.
---
I put mine on a Ravager.

Can another priest mind control him down from there ? Not encountered it myself

Hi, I looked into the sheet and it seems that gear "of the frozen wrath" have literally no impact on the calculations.  I removed all the gear in the "Gear" tab (to run the sim naked), and when I added just a "green of the frozen wrath", results were exactly the same.

Honest question, why would you choose TMW instead of WA or the other way around? Are there significant differences or is it just personal preff?

Hey. I've had cancer and that was a fun time compared to healing retarded mages that watch too much twitch.

You really think blizzard wasn‚Äôt monitoring the people leveling faster than anybody else? The only way you‚Äôre going to trick them is having people living in the same house account sharing, and I guarantee you that 40  players don‚Äôt all have that option. Not to mention a ton of the streamers.
---
Am gonna try to do it anyway. U do not need to use mc like guy's in the video u can let two elite's kill each other and after one dies finish second one. Is it gonna be longer for sure but still best farm u can do.
---
Not just the same levels, but the vendors and the low levels too!
---
DPriest with PI is the best PvP support spec imho. But I think you're asking more about PvE and in this case I don't think PI is worth losing Spiritual Guidance and Spiritual Healing over. That's a lot of healing power lost for a 15s CD.

He didn't outright say they wouldnt do it.  But as with all customer service roles it depends on the individual handling your case.  He's quite right though, some will and some won't.
---
If you read the post on the server subreddit and the comments, he says that while he can kick them, he is co-gm. He had the power to kick, also had the power over main gm, but if he did that, the other co-gm would say he is full of shit, get people back, so it would have to result in gkicking everyone anyway.
---
Doing it the way he did it brought a lot of attention to the whole thing so yea, I get it, in the end of the day, he succeeded.
---
Probably died while Ragnaros was submerged. Waiting til he emerged and then attacking before he was back into combat even bugged out the sons to despawn as the encounter was technically failed.

See the frontpage posts of people being butthurt about lack of tanks? Make money tanking, or do what everyone else does and gather or make a mage.
---
Thanks for that. Jump ahead until you see pronkers mounted in IF. That‚Äôs about when the discord call starts. 
---
Reddit is so quick to pick a side and ends up being completely wrong. Yeah, the mageblade theorycrafting might have been a bit shaky, but it wasn‚Äôt malicious, and certainly doesn‚Äôt deserve this kind of response from Hamish.
---
thank you very much :D
---
I have definitely blamed the tank when they have been at fault. Unfortunately, 99% of the time it's the dps not interrupting casting,  focusing the wrong target or stupidly pulling.
---
Just find what‚Äôs comfortable. I‚Äôve got a fairly wacky set up, but all the buttons feel good.

Play a tank then?

I think I'd quit. BC was the best, but if all my gear becomes irrelevant overnight, I'm not going to grind it all out again, knowing the wotlk will recycle naxx and make everything I worked for irrelevant again... I'm open to classic plus. But I'm also ok with just phase 6 and it ending. I assume if they do thay a new wow game will come out, which might appeal to me, but retail makes me laugh just hearing about it, and I don't trust the company at all...

It was always DMVC though, why change it now.

I have a fiery wep enchant on my wep as a rogue, should I change it to something else for MC or do people not care that much?
---
Yeh i suppose. I have played on so many private server these years and created so many toons that it doesnt matter for me \^\^ so i am just hopeful this time round i get to play my toon for couple of years instead of 1 like on private server before the server dies \^\^
---
It's the widely accepted and used term on English speaking servers. A lot of common terms don't make sense when divorced from their context: 
---
- Calling even a single monster a "mob"
---
- Calling non-boss monsters "trash"
---
- Even 'aggro' is just an informal short-form of 'aggravation', so someone who hasn't played games might not actually understand what you mean if you say you "drew aggro" 
---
- Grinding is another word that would probably get you some strange looks from non gamers. "I grinded those pirates for hours"  "Yeah OK bud you keep that in your bedroom alright?" 
---
I've seen some people use DD but it's rare. It's the DM/VC debate all over again, like no other dungeon is called after its end boss but a small number of people still think VC is the "correct" term.
---
Maybe there are some on the web idk. Could make one.
---
DMT huh, get Joe Rogan on this
---
World PvP isn't really about the pvp itself, but the influence it has on your decision making. Should you go to SV at lvl 30? Should you go hunting devilsaur leather solo or in a group? The answer is different depending on whether you are playing on a pve- or a pvp-server.
---
My vanilla experience was that it was always called VC and new players got shit if they said DM.
---
For some reason my experience is vastly different from what you state. When tanking instances I often have damage dealers that go wild right on the pull of course. Warriors pulling Recklessness with all their cooldowns and charge the second you reach the mobs or mages spamming AoE. But in most cases I don't really mind. Of course they are potentially making my job harder than it needs to be, but typically they perfectly know they are doing crazy stuff and will rather laught about themself then blame the tank if they die.
---
And here is the real kicker: If everyone is able to adapt, the run will be glorious. The damage warrior will kill his mob in seconds. Don't waste your time trying to get aggro against him, because then all the other mobs will run wild. Build threat on those instead, while just taunting the focus target on cooldown.
---
If the mage starts to AoE it is his responsibility to survive. Many have used a lot of AoE farming while leveling, so you can assume they know their stuff. Don't break their frostnova and occasionally taunt a mob that is getting close to them. Apart from that just enjoy watching them going ham.
---
Of course there are some people that think they can pull off this stuff, but really can't. Or maybe they tax their healer or tank too much and the pull ends in a disaster. I'm sure some of them will blame others rather than themself. But quite honestly I've run a lot of instances and most of the time people are rather chill. They want big numbers in their damage meter or whatever addon is currently en vogue. They want to have fun and are ready to die for their large numbers. Don't be rude to them for wanting to have fun. They are hoping for that glorious run where everyone gives their 100% and the instance is cleared in half the usual time. But they probably know not every run can be like that and if asked nicely they will slow down.
---
So at least give them the benefit of doubt. If your first impression is everyone is out to make your job harder and has no idea what he is doing, it will show. If your first instinct on a death is to put blame on someone for example, you will poison the atmosphere of the run. Even if you had toxic players in your last run (I won't deny they exist, but they are very rare in my experience), that doesn't tell you anything about the current one. The first wipe also simply shows the limits of your group, don't read too much into it. Stay chill and enjoy the run. Your job is to protect the healer, not to have threat from every single mob in every single situation. Don't overtax yourself and don't feel you alone are responsible for the success of the run. It is still a group effort.
---
We are playing 1.13! That logic makes no sense, since all basic features of 1.12 are in already.
---
Earthshaker-EU
---
Yeah i did earn some gold for that, been tanking for 3 weeks to gather my bis, but my guild need me as fury 3 raids days a week, and might be s bit expensive switching back and fourth
---
Hunters can solo tribute runs with creative use of your pet to round up trash mobs and FD when you run past.  One of the best gold farms in the game IMO because when you have done it you won't aggro anything and you can run around picking up dusty tomes.
---
I thought so...
---
Wrong, they have no reason to restore your pet except for good will. You pay them to play the game, not really for them to go out of their way to be nice to you lol
---
Keyring is part of phase 2. Blizzard is releasing Dire Maul ahead of schedule. The rest of phase 2 will come later this year.
---
K, and that's fun for you. But not everyone else thinks it's fun.
---
They moan about getting ganked should try the walk from South shore to SM at peek times. üòÇ
---
No, just the people like us who waste their time on video games
---
No problem! Also, based on your second point I want to advise a bit more. If the target wont live for the duration of rend then it isn't worth it and heroic strike is just about never worth it while leveling. You are better off using it for battle should or banking for the next mob. You won't gain rage off of your HS hit which does actually slow you down.
---
It is implemented and it's worth do to it in my opinion. I'm a Holy Priest with herbalism so it pays off to do some questing in an area and pick up some herbs every now and then.
---
I don't play retail, but when I learn about it through posts like this, I grow concerned for humanity. Why would anyone keep playing retail?
---
Lakeshire is a newer server and it is not dead...
---
In the evening it is marked as full and sprawling.
---
It should be crusader for now. I don't think anyone will care if it isn't actually a good weapon though.
---
Depending on class or level its not a problem really, and you can also just skip
---
Shouldn't be an issue unless your guild demand the right specc.
---
What's unknown at this moment is how demanding later raids will be. You don't want your clears to be tedious due to people being offspecced.
---
Priest could get up there themselves and MC him down, but he'll probably get them first.
---
Nah, it happens all the time, but oddly enough I've gotten along just fine with allies my level. Even as far as saving each other from bad pulls and such.
---
Death to the scourge, *and death to the living*

Are you sure you won the roll?

pretty funny a lvl 56 taking MC loot

---
OP: did you manage to get a single spell to hit during the boss encounter? :D
---
Amazing and congratulations
---
3 days a week? What do u do after clearing Mc and ony on one evening?
---
Population advantage is meaningless  versus good organization.
---
Then don‚Äôt post here in the first place you ding dong. Everyone said there is a chance but not guarantee they‚Äôll restore a user error
---
You should look up fury tanking. It's the best of both worlds for warriors, you need dps gear and tanking gear.
---
Look in combat log tab
---
We usaly all go farm rep, or farm items in dngs for  the guild
---
Yeah, I guess in a sense there's no use min-maxing since I'm not really playing in a setting that lends itself to min-maxing. I just really enjoy finding the tweaks that makes me as good as possible given these very specific circumstances. Though in this case I'm sure actual playing skill is even more important than the correct talents than it is in for example PvP settings. Thanks though!
---
Sad that one of the coolest figures in Warcraft has become a trivial boss in raid. Now hes just the Bitch King.
---
My man!
---
I have both of these. I will switch to Mara at 49!

That's very true, good point!
---
Stop stop, I can only get so erect
---
There was a typo in your meme. You meant Deadmines is VC.
---
60, 22
---
Life pro tip: if you get lost in BRM, just follow the carpet of skeletons to your instance entrance.
---
I wish more healers would do that actually. As a rogue I have pots, bandages, evasion, vanish, sprint, stuns, I basically never die in dungeons. I don't need mana wasted on me if I happen to take damage, but often a tiny scratch and healers will waste their time on me.
---
not sure about the others, but browsing reddit is definitely a stupid hobby
---
which doesnt do shit for that
---
You can easily include the healer BRD trinket from Golem Lord. It only adds 3-4min to the run =)
---
I hit 2.8k at the age of 17. You suck.
---
People have been calling deadmines DM for over a month, if people started changing it now nobody would understand what the fuck they were talking about.
---
And if we're starting to name instances after the  ame of the last boss then UBRS would become GD, strath undead would become BR and BRD would become ET. Really fucking confusing.
---
In character I'm Horde all the way, but I don't *actually* give a fuck about what faction I'm in. Alliance looks cool, always wanted to give it a try.
---
This. ClassicCastBars just shows the "wrong" cast time.
---
This is kind of how I'm looking at it for now as well. I think eventually server pop will decline to the point of a merge if guilds have Naxx on farm and they'll re-purpose servers for perhaps TBC. But I feel like either Classic Plus or TBC will come out before the population declines to the point of having to squash together servers. They know the demand is here so they'll probably try to strike while the iron is hot after they gauge the community reaction to TBC/Classic Plus.
---
&gt; Why is everyone so in favour of layering
---
Allow people to avoid griefer (aka level 60 farming level 30) and allow people to quest without having 30 people waiting to kill the same guy on very populated servers
---
There is very few negative to it except ? exploit ? and they do not impact people directly and are blow out of proportion on reddit
---
Why is tailoring so bad, if I may ask?
---
This. If you're going to focus someone, pick the rogue that seems like he knows his shit.
---
Unpopular opinion: I like balthazarion and his world chat spam
---
The inbetweener.
---
Working from home since I had no meetings today.
---
If you play druid you are the best tank for most dungeons and a viable healer/very viable off tank in raids. If you want to do both I would pick it, very underrated class.
---
Agreed. Anyone using reddit is ridiculous.
---
If I got 8/10 on MC with one pug and join another pug,  do I have to be on the exact same boss they are up to in order to join them?
---
I believe so.
---
"X" is a typically used mark as second damage target. Seems a lot of people haven't internalized this though, since even when I call my mark order at the start of a dungeon X typically lives a lot longer than it should.
---
Just for the sake of it: You should always play in Battle Stance when alone, and only switch to Berserker Stance for Whirlwind, not the other way around. The 3% crit don't make up for the 10% more damage taken. Just make sure you don't waste too much rage doing so, so 5/5 Tactical Mastery and don't switch above 25 rage.
---
Seems alright. Do you have to bid in order to get gold at the end?
---
&gt; You really think blizzard wasn‚Äôt monitoring the people leveling faster than anybody else? 
---
No
---
I respec at 52ish, once I had thrash blade and another bis offhand. As long as you stay in zones your level or below, you wont miss a ton and itll be better kill speed then arms. As for tanking, its much better then arms. Make a macro for equiping your shield and putting up shield block when you take a ton of dmg, rest of the time just dps ur heart out.

Uhhh... no? In all the PUGs I've been in (as a DPS), no one has ever flamed the tank or healer. Even if it's a wipe, people run back and keep going, because even if the tank is below average, no one want to spam LF1M Tank XX dungeon for 30 minutes before the group finally dissolves.
---
Just push through the bad raids, accept that mistakes will be made all around. And if the majority of your experience as a tank is bad, then it's probable that you too are terrible and you simply have not realized it.

Make a macro with a /cancelaura and Swipe or whatever your most spammed ability is, you'll just be removing any shield constantly.
---
Raids look for healers, dungeon groups for tanks.
---
Yup , there is nothing more exciting than leveling and seeing 3 guys enter your spawn. You know they will draw skull and attack you because no one comes there with 3 guys. You start to run and you instandly see they try to block you.
---
Its fucking amasing.
---
How it looks or what it looks like, fyi.

thank you. why is mageblade and talisman reserved?

Love it.

How can you zoom out that much?

I think it's past someone's bedtime.

I criticized a fellow lvl 60 for ganking low levels, he went mental and told me to go back to retail.

No problem. It's only as good as the people who update it so it can be scuffed on some shit. I prefer the prebis list on wowhead which is mostly updated for the Tuesday diremaul release.

TBC also has a lot of content that was originally intended to be in classic.

What i like about energy is that the game of keeping the right distance and going in and out while recovering energy is interesting gameplay wise.

but they are just rare and better than anything else available by a large marging

Not sure if it's mentioned here but when you get to Eastern/Western Plaguelands do not vendor any Evil Bat Eyes or whatever the name is called. When Darkmoon is released they is a neck from it that's insanely good for Warriors/Rogues and whoever likes those kind of stats. Pretty sure it's BiS 
---
[Amulet of the Darkmoon](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19491)
---
I think you meant Undercity.
---
There's such a lack of tanks because of bad class design (only 1 out of 8 classes is incentivized to go tank, and that class has as much incentive to go dps instead).
---
That's pretty much it.
---
I don't think you would find them completely void of empathy, but from speaking to ninjas they definitely seem to have a few less points on the "give a shit about other people" scale.
---
I don't think you can join another pug at all because of the ID lock not boss lock.
---
The market is already full of bags, and there aren't many things to craft worth much more than the mats they take. Tailor does however give access to some BOP craftables (like the robe and bloodvine set bonus,) and eventually the bloovine set, which is worth some cash.

You can just save your cloth and do it at level 60, or whenever you're done making the easy cash on skinning.

It's on a thrash blade and I don't really wanna put crusader on it when I'm gonna upgrade to dalrends when I get them
---
It didn't even cross my mind to roll on leather items if there are leather class in my group to be honest. I would find that bordeline if not stated from the start. A caster weapon could be an upgrade on my current weapon but I'm not going to take it if the caster wants it for example
---
Yesterday another guildie of mine complaint about a lvl 31 rogue ganking him and other people in Hillsbrad. I was in Marshes and didn't want to move there. I made a proposition to him. He finds a warlock and summons me, I deal with the rogue (Im 42). 
---
And the guy did it. And I disposed of the rogue as promised by killing him 5 times before he ran away. 
---
Took care of a paladin and a mage as a bonus.
---
Was praised as a lowbie protector for a short time.
---
Took me awhile to see it to. On top of the left building. I'm guessing he was attacking people.
---
\[X reserved\] was never really a thing outside of semi-official guild pugs for places like ZG, MC, Ony or sometimes UBRS, where a guild would reserve bindings/eye of rag/crafting mats and occasional quest items. 
---
What was really common though was "LFM UBRS NO ROGUES, NO PALADINS" or other variations to limit loot competition. 
---
I reserved a few items myself on occasion, if I'm only doing UBRS to get the MH, then I'll reserve it, put the group together, get healers, limit competition for other drops, organize healers, provide the key and tank. I'll also make sure we get a Jed ID for the trinket. I got my MH and we geared up a lot of people with truestrikes, and Rend loot in the process. 
---
Same with BRD, guildie and myself only needed HOJ, so we put that on reserve, got casters who wanted the BIS belt from arena or golem lord loot, we did 60 runs or so for 2 x HOJ over a couple of days and geared up a lot of people in the process. 
---
The way I see it, the entitled one isn't the person who spends 1 - 2 hours running a dungeon where they can get 1 upgrade that has a 7% drop chance from 1/5 bosses, it's the person who spends 1 - 2 hours running a dungeon where they can get 9 upgrades from 5/5 bosses, but they still want the 10th one too.

---
We had a guildie arena team that was set for #1 in a season TBC in 3s (cant remember which, guessing season 2)
---
Athene was rank #2. He came into our teamspeak and begged our guilds #1 team to let him have #1, because of how important it was for his image, his youtube channel and so on. 
---
He got #2 that season, and was no longer "the best paladin in the world"
---
Oh ok so solo questing I should just stay in battle stance. I think from now on I will dungeon cleave in SM 30-42. So the setup is probably 3 warriors, 1 shammy for wf totem and 1 healer. Should all warriors just have berserker stance activated?
---
No, but you can look at the Dire Maul pieces in the P2 pre-raid BiS list.
---
Whats the better leveling duo, paladin + warlock or paladin + rogue?
---
Same, so far anyway. Its like having a crazy preacher that hangs around shops spouting stuff about the rapture.
---
You're an edgelord is what you are
---
Ive read name plates can stack as well, do you use that?
---
Yeah I read that most of the time heroic strike is useless unless you have like tons of rage (above 50). Best is to just apply rend if mob alive more than 8 sec and then just spam sunder armor and execute.
---
\- hmm i can just ignore this and do my own thing. its internet.

\- oh wait, why i don't type something long and get screenshot of my super awesome cool BUUUURRRNNN answer and post in reddit?  omg i'm a genious!

---
Play the AH
---
I was there mostly for the decurse and did off healing, I just made clear that im a lovely Moonkin at start and will roll on DPS. So I pretty much healed and did the Moonkin dance for mentality boosts
---
Probably Paladin + warlock due to easier access to dungeons, less overlap for gear (swords) and a faster flow through mobs.
---
i can understand taking it very seriously if its a novel thing, like if you're a hobbyist musician keeping up with the latest developments and creativity... but vanilla wow was fully discovered and figured out fucking ages ago there is nothing new to be found here so why go to THAT extreme over it?

Warlock with approx 13 talents left - I'm at a point to choose between 5/5 Imp. Drain life +whatever or Imp Shadowbolt and all the way into Shadowburn. Currently full affli with 8 points in Demo (HS+stam) 
---
I will probably respecc to SM Ruin at 60,but for the leveling (and dungeons) and my love for PVP I lean heavily towards Shadowburn and maybe 2 of the remaining points into Imp drain life rather than 5/5 imp drainlife for barely any impact (10% is nothing)
---
I've never had a single negative comment thrown towards me as a Druid tank. Never really played any similar mmo either. Tanked from DM to SM so far.

Thank you! Y, was super shaky haha

my server was at medium even at 6 in the morning during the week. I was trying to get broken tooth as my hunter pet but no matter when I was checking for him there were several other hunters looking for him. got lucky at 6 in the morning though :)
---
Your points basically simplify to dps doesnt understand dungeon layout, threat in general, and time commitment to complete dungeon. Raid Pugs have similar issues. As a warrior tank bad dps have joined my party, wiped the group, rage quit, whisper obcenities, then add my chars name to ignore list. I probably wouldn't  have kicked these people from the group or insult them. Part of learning dungeons is from making mistakes. If a dps makes a mistake it's not a big deal. Some of these people later on down the road actually apologize to you and make amends. Part of tanking is a leadership role. Explaining things to others, identifying why this pull has this priority over the others, keeping track of mana, etc.. If you do a good job with a group they generally invite you to other dungeons. At level 60 your friends list gets expanded with quality heals, dps, and you are no longer running pugs with randos. You find yourself in situations where this is a friend of a friend or a guildie so they are vouched for. It also works out to where a group is LF1M tank and you get whispered and do not have to spend anytime forming a group together. So life improves as a tank at 60 for dungeons. The issues that make people respec to fury at 60 generally deal with raiding. But if you out gear the higher lvl dungeons you can handle them with tank gear and fury spec.

Congrats I've run 42 times and have yet to even see it drop lol

Guys, be kind to /u/LilUziVurqe, he's still developing. Im sure most of you cringe when looking back your mid-teens.
---
I mean, I fucking love this shit, but I do have to point out how this sub would be seething with rage if you had killed him, and love it now, eventhough death just means corpse run and this is a lot more annoying than a corpse run imo.
---
Troll Hunter - Orc Shaman
---
Undead Rouge - Undead Warlock/Mage
---
Because killing someone who is grey to you, is a dick move. Whilst PvP has a bit of a Rock Paper Scissors thing going on. And your complaining about Paper beating Rock. 
---
Some battles are just going to be a big uphill struggle. You'll want to accept that, or consider a PvE server. :)
---
Uh... It's literally more than 2 dps better, lmfao. At level 19, that is an insane upgrade.
---
(Also you need an offhand).
---
3 days? That‚Äôs a lot for p1
---
It always pains me when SW references go in vain
---
Yeah I don't really want to use macros. I would love to stance dance manually. Right now I use F1, F2 and F3 for stance swapping I wonder if there is a smoother ergonomic way.
---
On a PvE server, so not obvious when you havent experianced it.
---
The only one i would be flaming is the Human warr with vendorstrike equipped
---
What's impressive to me is how you got all those guildies to Winterspring
---
I hit 60 in week 2, and could count on one hand the number of times I PVP'd. Now, I have much better gear then most of the community, so theres not much reason. Besides, there is so much to do to prepare for the bloodbath in phase 2...
---
...including leveling an alt. So, after leveling my alt and getting ruthlessly CAMPED by the biggest potatoe 60s in low level zones, I have lost all mercy. My heart is stone and I could care less if it slows me down. After what you have done, I am void of all emotion. RED is DEAD.
---
Tauren Hunter/Druid or Druid/Shaman
---
Yeah, definitely dont bother with crusader for trash blade. Good luck on the dalrends farm
---
The period is correct, the comma is not necessary. I definitely could, and it changes the pace of the sentence, but it‚Äôs not incorrect to omit it there
---
Wowhead now has Diremaul in their bis lists
---
Nah you're just that guy who thinks flexing with a 2300 rating on Reddit makes you cool, that's why you're getting downvoted lmao
---
Don't get mad, get glad.
---
2 raids day 1 rep farm day,
---
Yes, exploiting terrain to get pvp kills avoiding guards is most deffinately against the rules
---
Arcane shot yeah!
---
Yea.. skipping the elite quests in nearly every zone your questing in is a fun way to play lol
---
Pretty hyped for tbc on ascension tbh
---
Orc shaman &amp; undead mage would be my suggestion. Obviously one of you would have to do a lot of running to start together but totally worth it. Insane crowd control and dps, plus the mage would love the mana totem.
---
I‚Äòve had a hunter rage quit on me cause I asked him to attack my target. He ensured me he was even tho the other target had hunters mark and died at the same time as my target
---
Do you charge something for food, water and portals as a mage? If yes, how much?
---
Jumping on a building you can gain access to is not breaking any rules
---
In my experience you can affort to be very picky as a tank. UBRS is one exception as there are very few interesting drops for healers past the typical Rend/Jed run, but for all other instances you don't have to wait.
---
If I am looking for a specific item from an instance, I don't have to join a group where another character also needs it. There will be a group without competition for it and why wouldn't I chose that one? This is one of the perks of playing a sought after role after all.
---
Traitor.
---
I wouldn't search for a group hours on end but if I had the choice, which I don't have as a rogue, I would exclude melee dps as well, not even reserving, which comes to the same outcome. I just value my time.  
---
I personally don't see the problem, people agree to the reserve or not, if they do, seemingly, they need something else from the dungeon, which is a better alternative than not inviting them in the first place due to their class.
---
that hasn't been my experience on arcanite reaper.  the server is very small
---
China numba wun

... A calm refutation is a sign of a mental breakdown? I stand in the company of intellectual giants and lo am I dwarfed.

If you really think apes is quality over quantity it just shows your immense misunderstanding of the situation
---
6 is correct, gave a 10% loss on exp per mob compared to 5manning it.
---
Its just north of your city. Not too bad
---
I was making a comparison on how long back vanilla before we got the keyring. My mentioning 1.11 was just to show that the majority of vanilla was played with having to carry all your keys around in bags wasting space and we are not even 2 months into classic and the OP is already complaining about not having a small feature that has been designed to come out at a later phase (most likely 2 but we wont know until blizzard decides to). No where did I try to justify when we should get the key ring or if we should have it or not.
---
STV is extremely good for melee classes because of the gear you get. Boots, gloves, and pants with agility and/or strength have higher stats than all crafted gear other than maybe some rare crafts. 
---
Plus the fact that your first necklace will most likely come from here.
---
You can so the quests at lower levels but you will most likely need a group.
---
Actually. Westfall ovet duskwood. Just follow the river south and you get out near nessingway. Alternatively. Take the ocean from westfall to the northern beach of stv. Both routes are way faster
---
Tanking is so easy as an arm warrior, stack sunder armour smash thunderclap and keep aggro off everyone.

**11/11 &lt;Senile Chieftains&gt;** | EU Pvp Shazzrah Server, Horde | Casual but serious raiding guild.     
---
**Introduction**   
---
"Senile Chieftains" is made for people who would like to see all the classic raid content (again), but are not able or willing to spend 8 nights a week playing. Of our 4 raids that we will run every week, we only expect you to attend 1 (read our guild-info for some extra rules concerning availability). There are options available for people who like to raid multiple days.    
---
We are mostly ex raiders who have grown to old to raid to many evenings a week. Back in vanilla we cleared aq40 until the 'twin emperors', but because of the "tbc" release the guild disbanded.     
---
**Expectations from members**   
---
We are looking for experienced and skilled players to realize our goal of clearing all classics raid content. New players are also welcome, but keep in mind that most of our players are now 30 years and older so we will have a more mature guild environment.      
---
**Raid information**    
---
Raiding days will be Mon-Thur 20:00 - 23:00 (server time). Once available, we will run organized raids on off days for lower tier content for alts and those who want to complete their tier/bis sets. Loot will be distributed by a loot council aided by a hidden dkp system.    
---
Check [https://www.senilechieftains.com/](https://www.senilechieftains.com/) for more information!
---
If guards can‚Äôt attack you it is
---
When classic+ comes and they replace the prot spec.
---
45 shami
---
I can't gank low level players on PvE servers. Level 60s are the paper to the rock of level 20s.
---
Was tha in ya trousers, Tommy?
---
Some of us only get like one, if that, solid upgrade from DM.  My gear isn‚Äôt crazy, there‚Äôs just not much gear there for some specs (fury warrior, personally.)
---
That‚Äôs not how it works
---
In classic, IDs are not boss specific and person-bound but an actual raid/dungeon ID. You can only enter the MC ID you got, and others can only join you if they either have the same ID (i.e. participated in your run) or no ID yet, in the latter case once they get locked in they lose their chance at the first 8 bosses for this raid lockout period.
---
Fuck tbc.
---
&gt; As long as there are no flying mounts.
---
Some TBC content is specifically designed around flying mounts. Areas not reachable without them, quests that explicitly require them and economic gold sinks factored into them.
---
Removing them is a lot of work to get right. It might be doable, but the question is: is it worth it for Blizzard?
---
Its better for warlocks than mages. But if you get the staff you have competed the raid anyway so.. 
---
Top mage or top lock.
---
Flame Shock lol
---
Depends what level you are on. First of all get healbot or a similar addon. It is just impossible to heal with the standard UI. Healbot shows you for how much a heal will hit and you just need a single click while pressing shift, ctrl or alt to cast whatever spell you want on the player you want.
---
Then what you wanna do is use your heal with your highest heal per mana. For you this should be your max rank greater heal until you reach the 50s.  After this it depends on your +heal and there are online tools to figure it out.
---
You never want to overheal, so leave people until your heal hits for max. You can however precast. This means you start the cast on whoever you expect to take damage and if he didnt take the amount you expected, you just move a bit to stop the heal. 
---
In a hard fight, dont be afraid to let the dps die if your mana is wayning. Especially if it is a mage, chances are, he has no mana anymore anyway and is thus useless. 
---
For your stat and talent priority, look for guides.
---
Arena/anger/golem runs are you run into BRD, clear to arena, do arena, go upstairs and clear to general angerforge, kill him, then clear to golemlord, kill him.  Reset and repeat.  
---
A full quest run is also nice.
---
I killed an warrior 40 ally as an 33 rogue in STW. First he dident understand why an 7 lvl player below him is ganking his ass, so he just standing there and looks bewildered why. Then suddenly when he realizes that he has half hp he starts going for the attack, but he got a 5 sek kidney shot and died shortly after. (I'm a ork combat rogue)
---
This is what all the people flaming the tank posts needed.
---
If you just call a tank bad because he had peoblens with a specific group, you just don't know how the game works. Probably more than 50% of threat management falls to dps, not tanks.
---
Do anyone know which raid ui addon is this?
---

---
Raided for the first time yesterday, and raid groups was blocking my vision so badly.
---
I‚Äôm honestly not trying to be mean ‚Äî however, I think this needs to be said for your sake:
---
It‚Äôs great that you love this game for everything it encompasses ‚Äî like that interaction you had with the ‚Äúenemy‚Äù paladin ‚Äî but you cant be spelling the word ‚Äòdebt‚Äô incorrectly, man. 
---
Hate me all you (and whoever reads this) want, but... there‚Äôs not even a chance it was a typo...
---
&gt;Depends on what you call manageable. 
---
&gt;
---
&gt;If its only queues on sundays, then its fine. If its a queue at 5-6pm every single day, even if its "only" 1h, then its unmanageable in the long run for the majority of people.
---
It's basically as you said. If you long in between peak times (5‚Äê9pm weekdays) expect a roughly hour long queue.. 
---
I say manageable because this is exactly what it is, manageable. I'm our of work every day before any queues form and if I'm not,I can remote log in before peak hits. 
---
&gt;I want to be able to play when I feel like it.
---
You can do that on every server if you plan it right.
---
Fire mage max is 42, untalented 36, deep frost mage is 36, average PvE spec is 33 for frost and untalented frost is 30. So there can be quite the variation for the mage.
---
so you are saying "I am completely unreliable, but want someone else to work around my schedule"... 
---
Good luck bro.
---
Can someone explain, what exactly weapon range is, and why it is a better indicator for an upgrade than dps or maximal weapon damage? Paladin asking.
---
I like you.
---
Warlock. No contest.
---
Warrior here, had 2 bad runs, first one was in DM, everyone was friendly but we had the stereotype huntard who had us killed 5-6 times because he didn't know how to manage his pet.
---
Other one was for SM, just wanted to run GY and saw a LF1M Tank SM GY, so I join and run from Menethil to SM, as I arrives the leader tell me we're not running GY but Lib, which I didn't want to run and hadn't sign up for. I tell him that I'll gladly run GY but I'm not up for the other parts and that I'll go on questing because I like to quest if they decide to run the other parts. I was quickly invectived by the the leader who called me a liar because no one like questing and that he knows that I want to run Lib because that's good money and exp/hour. Quickly left that group
---
The zone wide yells from Elis kinda ruin the privacy.
---
I even had some random rogue try to tank the skeletons for me. No idea how it works, considering other players can't even see them. And when my alt just stood nearby as backup, it immediately spawned the cleaner.
---
Thanks so much! It's also one of my favourite parts :)
---
i had the luck to find a blacklotus yesterday but a human rogue was fighting near it. i assumed he wanted to loot it. well as he finished i saped him and snatched it off in front of him. he killed me afterwards but well worth
---
I do use R, T, and F1 - F5 and the 3 buttons on the side of my mouse on other bars. I have long fingers so 6 isn't much of a reach for me, but I use it for rarer spells
---
Thank you! :) I hope you like the other ones too!
---
I agree that the source I pulled up has some unfortunate wording in it :)
---
Thanks :D
---
Don't need a tracker if you attack every horde you see.
---
Tanked DM without any issues with zero dungeon / relevant mmo experience. Even triggered Smite by running straight at the chest.
---
To me it entirely depends on the item, the people in the group and my relationship with them.  
---
    
---
If something BiS drops for a friend/guildie in the group I'll (try to) send it their way.  
---
If something absolutely non-bis drops (eg. myrmidons terrible ring) and I'm with a pug, hell yeah I'll try to get it to line my pockets.  
---
This is what I mean when I say that it's fair game - noone has the right to feel entitled to anything other than the roll chance.
---
You have proofs obviously?
---
Coffee here on my tea break. Cheers!
---
Running dungeons with idiot dps is why this is done. Think a little.
---
Its about 13% better (not taking into account the proc vs 12 AP, I don‚Äôt know which is better) and they have similar top end damage due to cruel barb being a bit slower. I personally wouldn‚Äôt call that insanely better, especially since one is free and the other will probably be ~400-1000 gold depending on your server. 
---
In the end you‚Äôll always get shit on by a hunter in greens anyways.
---
They do actually, since half the comments on a tanking related post just calls the tank in question "AWFUL" while being completely ignorant of the surrounding situation
---
Spent 2 hours on my hunter trying to get the ghost cat pet from Darkshore. Finally managed to spawn, start taming it and some helpful priest comes along and starts healing me, aggros the cat and now I'm unable to tame it. To make it worse he started spamming heals on himself so attacking the thing wasn't enough to get threat back without killing it. I'm fucking screaming at him to stop and just let it kill him. He starts running and I'm afraid it's going to despawn if he gets out of its range. Luckily it dropped off him and came back to me and I succeeded in taming it.
---
half ogre!
---
I have atlasloot but it doesn't tell me that. Is it an option?
---
Links to each spec?
---
Sir, you have either had an horrific string of events in your wow time or are just plain insane speaking bs.
---
Never have I had a run where any of the members flame the tank. Correction - I had ONE Zul'Farrak run where we had a druid Tank which the only thing he did was auto-attack a single mob from a pack of mobs, everytime the healer tossed a heal, he got aggro and the dps had to peel. The healer commented on this and the tank simply responded - "I'm outtie" and left.
---
Tanks at this time are the most entitled little shits the game has seen. From only joining a run if they get to reserve all the items they desire for themselves, asking for gold for their "tanking services" (rofl), only joining a group if they get summoned, leaving the group if they happen to die, etc. And this ofc means that they can tank in an arms PVP spec, god forbid someone ask which spec they're running, he'll probably ask the leader to kick that person lest he leave the group because he was "offended". Of course I'm not saying every tank is like this, but from the overall players I've seen, tanks are the majority here.
---
Now, I have no problems with tanks wanting to take their time, mark stuff up and go in the route they prefer. I'm patient enough to wait for their sissy overly cautious way of approaching a dungeon, their need to do a ready check before pulling a critter (not only because I try to be a patient player but because I HAVE NO CHOICE, the alternative is usually waiting another 30/60 mins to find a new tank - and they KNOW this), LOSing every single pack even when there is no need for it, and all the other nancy activities you've probably experienced as well.
---
With this out of the way, having myself tanked for a great long while during the time I played this game, there are some tanks which are completely trash at performing their role (Yes, people who don't know how to tank exist as well!). Sure, this can happen from time to time and I've mostly seen people trying to be helpful instead of raging at the guy. When the tank recognises this and changes for the better, all is good, but it does get particularly interesting when they refuse the idea that something other than their way of doing things is better.
---
The most usual case I see is when I get a tank in a group which is  a decent person, not resorting to the douchebag strategies stated above, doing his job tanking for the group. When this happens, it's rare when someone in the group doesn't comment on how smooth the run is going or how the tank is a good tank. This typically leads to people opening up a bit in the chat, enjoying some banter while the run is going and even adding each other to friends.
---
tl;dr - never seen anyone flame a tank in a group except one specific occasion; many tanks are entitled little shits who think their way of doing things is THE only way; decent tanks (and decent tank players) usually get the most love from groups and make a lot of friends easily.
---
Racials will matter a bit less in BGs, I feel. As you just won't always have the cooldowns. Whilst with World PvP, that is much more likely. And they can be devastating in PvP! 
---
For instance, take Undead Vs Priest; their main CC is countered immediately by the racial, and unlike Warlocks, they can't spam it. 
---
Or Dwarf Rogue, who can reset more reliably due to their's, or counter one of the CC tools of other Rogues. 
---
An Orc's Hardiness could essentially break a Rogue's stunlock, or otherwise be unaffected by the popular grenades...
---
I feel you don't have to be going for Rank 14 for racials in PvP to matter; just if you are serious, or otherwise enjoy PvP more than PvE, having worse racials could become a regret later down the line... But ultimately, you do you.
---
Better than most people....
---
It's a self fulfilling prophecy.
---
I never say anything, if they want portal I open trade and they usually put 1g, for water I wait until they insert some money usually goes from 40s to 1g
---
I have also noticed this. Its the same for NPCs. As a 60 mage in vanilla I remember (and have videos) of fully pulling GY solo and killing the mobs without much issues, due to the mobs missing a ton of hits / the dmg they did was next to nothing against a player 30 levels higher. This is not at all the case in Classic. These mobs will kill you in 13-14 strikes, nothing misses, nothing dodges. For spells its different. If you fight for example the last boss in RFD as a 60 mage, 99% of his spells are resisted, but what  happens when he comes over a melees? He hits you exactly as he would hit a level 40 player. 
---
I cannot think of anything other than blizzard has fucked up on scaling.
---
No as the 1st patch was suppose to be phase 2 but they push dire maul out earlier meaning it's Phase 1.5? So I assume the key bag is still in phase 2
---
I started again. So 10. :D
---
Altaholics unite!
---
I was there when it happened.. Still traumatised
---
So if Baltha with the same phrases repetaed 100 time a day.
---
it is faster just to keep leveling and passively get the gold for mount as you raise your level.
---
If you reserve a loot do you change the loot setting for that boss or just expect no one else to loot?
---
The enchanting material market is not a big moneymaker, your profits will increase but not substantially.
---
How do you solo as priest? Ignore everything else and just go straight up to the Princess?
---
It is though
---
Ayyyy lmao. No it wasn't a typo and I don't hate you, but thank you for mentioning. I corrected it.
---
True,  but i get 10% attackspeed hahha
---
Grats btw!
---
AoE grind whatever humanoids you feel comfortable with at your gear and skill level.
---
Expect everyone here to say keep leveling for gold.
---
just as a hint: you dont need to type *crickets chirping sfx* all the time. kind of bloats the text and makes it awkward to read. a simple *crickets* does the job just fine.
---
I'm glad you liked it! :) In case you didn't see, you can watch Gorak (try to) complete his very first quest [here!]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHyhXS4_TF8)
---
That‚Äôs actually exactly how it works after several blue posts and the fact that people are constantly getting banned for it. In neutral towns abusing the terrain in a spot where you can attack others but they cannot attack you is a bannable offense. You might not agree with it or like it but that‚Äôs just the facts.
---
Yea, playing UO in a pvp guild (order/chaos) meant you constantly needed to buy new armor and weapons. That shit was expensive, as you weren't even safe in cities.
---
That's actually a small Easter Egg reference to a movie :) Can anyone guess it?
---
It actually is, Blizzard has ruled this as exploitation of unexpected mechanics and has at least temp-banned people for doing this.
---
Crushed out some heroes of might and magic 3 a few weeks ago
---
Think of it this way...bad healers are a waste of space.
---
For simple math, let's say your guild uses 10 healers in a raid. You manage to beat MC in 3 hours. All 10 of you are dps and\or hyrbid builds.
---
How many of those healers can be removed if all of you went proper builds?
---
The more healers you can remove the more dps you can add, resulting in a faster run.
---
So, it really depends on how hardcore your guild is.
---
Looks like a PvE realm to me.
---
He should roleplay something else.
---
it will be really rare to find somebody in this situation though (afk running)   if they are manually controlling their movement the result is not this cool
---
I've seen a bunch of screenshots posted on this Reddit from GMs saying it is indeed against the rules.
---
He raised 21 million for charity with is insane on itself. He also played 1 million poker hands in online poker playing on 24 tables at the same time. Following some pattern where he also made alot of money for his own orginisation.
---
He had bought a office building in germany where people can come to work to improve the world in trade for food and a bed. 
---
He is not a bad man and his intentions has always been good. He is a bit mental but I love the dude and he did some amasing things.
---
To be hounest, there is no personality that I follow as long as Athene. He is just so intresting.
---
Maybe it‚Äôs a bad idea for warriors. To be honest I‚Äôm a paladin tank and when I typed that I only thought of what would be better to help me tank as most of my threat is from AOE abilities while I‚Äôm only meleeing one target at a time.
---
You found it! :D It's definitely a reference to Always Sunny :)
---
Can't even express in words how good that was. Sublime job!
---
&gt;Tracking button (for things like flightmasters or mailboxes)
---
use the addon Handynotes\_NPC for this, its sooo helpfull
---
How would the RL cheat this? Everyone knows what they bid.
---
I guess they could tell their friends the highest bid and their friend could bid more if they wanted, but if they paid more than your max, who cares?
---
You can't.
---
Fuck this noise.
---
If you wanna stomp on level 20 be my guests. I do it all the time when traveling around. It‚Äôs fun.
---
Not if they're in a group with me.
---
They are pretty close in preformance for most of the content
---
but they 
---
Leveling - Swords is better, can't backstab most of the time
---
Farming - Swords same as above
---
PVP - Depends on the class, hemo (swords or w/e) is better at control and much stronger in the mirror, but daggers is better burst (and much better vs mages because of double imp sprint)
---
MC/Ony - Swords is better preraid, until daggers gets corehound tooth and gloves then daggers pulls ahead.
---
BWL- Swords passes daggers again with maldeath and CTS
---
AQ - Swords still better until C'thun dagger, then dagger pulls ahead
---
Naxx -

Do they mean the cave to Winterspring? I ran through too and didn't die.
---
PvE Realm. We ain't much into PvP anymore. Just playing classic to relax.
---
PvE realm .
---
Yes , it would have been an unmitigated disaster.
---
Tanaris is also a good candidate
---
You will still be running in the same direction if you went around the planet...if the earth eas flat tho, you will have to turn around.
---
Can you test if it procs off mind vision, like some people claim? I probably won't see it now that DM is coming out.
---
What? Not earning any special privileges my ass XD
---
I agree that tanks who are competent don‚Äôt usually get blamed.
---
That being said, tanking can often FEEL like you‚Äôre doing a bad job even when you‚Äôre doing well.  I‚Äôve had runs where I felt like I was really struggling and performing poorly, but had no deaths (or basically no deaths) and was taking 70%+ of the damage, and a bunch of times where I‚Äôve said ‚Äúmy bad‚Äù or something similar and the group won‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm talking about.
---
And it‚Äôs not a total lack of confidence on my end, like, I know that I‚Äôm a significantly above average tank.  That being said, it‚Äôs a job where ‚Äúfailure‚Äù to perform optimally is nearly guaranteed, unlike with DPS, where the ‚Äúfail‚Äù state isn‚Äôt so clear cut, or as a healer, where the fail state is much more infrequent and avoidable.
---
Take 1 less priest/druid then.
---
i think you‚Äôre shadowbanned lol
---
distract isn't supposed to do that right? i thought it stopped you moving until you re-initiated it with a keypress
---
Doh. Yes, for sure. I‚Äôve always played alliance, so that slipped my mind.
---
Barrens is Horde territory, they doesn't get pvp toggled on automatically, but I did. They could do me in any time.
---
Go to tinker and then to princess, same as everyone. Run around and shadow word pain her up
---
Grouped with someone yesterday who had this problem. It seems unfortunately that the only solution is to abandon the quest and try again.
---
and you 'shot' the ball into the pond or on angry neighbour's rooftop.....   game over...
---
The fuss was if you ran a pug with 1-2-3 etc other friends, they could roll need for certain items and then trade the winnings to the desired person, thus vastly increasing their chance of winning a roll against a random person.
---
Raids are more organized and such scenarios are unlikely.
---
This. I did a LBRS with pugs a few days ago for my UBRS key and even though everyone were lvl 58-59 and we ended up pulling 1 or sometimes even 2 extra packs (one such time with the Orcs just after Halcyon, we never wiped because the mage and warlock were on point with CCs and cooldown use and the healer knew how to heal properly without wasting mana.
---
Meanwhile the next day I ran with all 60s and wiped 3 times because nobody finished runners, people were semi-afk or just afk without saying a word and warlock kept "misclicking" his dots on extra packs we didn't even need to kill. 
---
It was a nightmare.
---
That‚Äôs normal on a pvp server but camping people for 3 days is very pathetic.
---
Spot the British Redditor.
---
Damage range means the min and max damage of the weapon (listed above DPS). Skills scale by the range while DPS only tells how much damage you do with auto attacks.
---
In short slower weapons do higher damage when using skills.
---
That‚Äôs a lot of bread on Chinese servers
---
Because it's kinda lame......
---
This wasn't a thing back in the day and its kinda against the whole spirit of the game.
---
Maybe reserving one item is fine, but you see these douchebags reserving everything good in a dungeon and expecting people to come with them
---
oof definitely will be quitting as soon as tbc comes out. this is interesting seeing all these opinions i always thought everyone hated tbc
---
The answer to that question is that the raids don't even work properly in the Legion client right now and phases were only done to buy them time to scramble and finish the game.
---
There are  quests for reef (elite murlocks undereater) in stv gromgol. Do not even bother to take that quests.
---
You can kill tinkerer and princess, and rotgrip too but its risky. You can skip all the trash at 60 by hugging walls. Tinkerer you just kill normally since he uses a gun at range and does little damage. Princess just dot and run, with boots speed enchant it should work out fine.
---
The most accurate part of this meme is the fact that it‚Äôs an alliance player

---
Resto shammy here. When I reach out to mages I'm not grouped with (taking a polite and kind tone, always whisper rather than just slapping up a trade window) I always tip those that don't ask for an upright fee - if they do ask for a fee for water, I just skip it completely. Portals should be tipped since those actually cost materials, I think 50s to 1g is fairly standard and acceptable for those. 
---
But asking for gold for water or food seems pretty greedy, if you are in a hurry or don't feel like catering to that end, just say "no, sorry" instead.
---
wow, that is a lot of good preparation! I just use feign dead and never die either ;-)
---
Hehe j/k. I have bandages &amp; pots too. Especially bandage AFTER a fd if I was damaged. No need for healers to waste their mana on me.
---
Holy moly i never saw so many skeletons laying around
---
I asked last week too. 
---
What addon shows class symbols when I target a player instead of the usual head display?
---
Was running along minding my own business in Arathi as a lvl 43 rogue heading to Stormgarde. A gnome mage lvl 36 or 37 yelled U R BAD H A H A H A H A and proceeded to sheep me and run away. I try not to be a stereotypical undead rogue and gank unless provoked. But that gnome thought he was safe close enough to refuge point... chased him down and well, needless to say he learned to leave people alone that day.
---
yeah , but at level 60 you can just farm mara for 30-40 shrooms/hour as any class.
---
All of these "hurr durr  I got blamed as a TANK (or even healer)" seem to be extremely prevalent lately.
---
I personally as a healer have never been blamed unless it was my fault. Hell, most of the time when I actually could have saved someone if I used the fastest most mana costly spell, they take the blame themselves. 99% of the time a dps can avoid taking damage if they paid attention to threat metre, stepped out of AOE or cleave etc.
---
I'm starting to think that all these posts are made by people who actually suck at tanking or healing and get offended when they try to do a supportive role and get *pikachufaced* when they fail at their role and the group dies because of it.
---
If you are a tank or healer, you still need to know how to tank or heal or the group straight up wipes. Unlike dps, if you don't know how to dps usually you're just slowing down the group ever so slightly.
---
That one time you do meet a complete nutcase, you don't need to make a post on reddit about it. Just ignore them and move on.
---
Facts.
---
Let‚Äôs say I‚Äôm a unemployed cavedweller.
---
I'm in like an assortment of prebis/T2/T1 and I never drink anymore in 5 mans.
---
Levelling yeah, gotta drink. I'm spoiled now. Even in Strat I'll just cast a renew and jump around and type in chat about random nonsense and if something terrible happens maybe use a R2 heal.
---
I'm leveling a priest and started healing dungeons. I've found that I'm absolutely unable to deal with an emergency. My gear has int and spirit, but my mana pool just depletes so fast. Is this normal, and if so, when does it get better? For context, I am using Renew for small pulls, downranking Heal and using Lesser Heal for mana conservation, and max rank Heal for big damage. 
---
I've spent a lot of time healing in later expansions, but never in vanilla, so this could just be adjusting to expectations. Does the stress diminish over time?
---
My thoughts in response to this post as a new alliance player who played an orc warrior for 8 years:
---
https://youtu.be/8DXa229y3PM
---

---
Wow thanks! That‚Äôs pretty cool.
---
what is the horde equivalent of that mount?
---
Lmao dumbass
---
Dude, you should start a podcast
---
Can anyone tell me how to drag the color selector wheel for setting chat color back onto my screen?
---
[https://ibb.co/6WTRZYg](https://ibb.co/6WTRZYg)
---
See the color wheel on the right, with most of it sticking off the screen?  Ive tried every combination of shift/control/alt + right/left click that I can think of to try to drag the window?  I've tried reloading UI, restarting game, turning off all addons, using the "reset chat" option.
---
I am at a loss.
---
Hey buddy, I was gonna let you live actually. I'm generally fairly generous and hospitable to alliance, my plan was to drop you to 5% health and then mc you into a renew and just be on my way. However, when I got you to 5% you /spit on me, and that's when I choose to mc you into the nearby mobs instead so you'd remember me with the repair bill. See you at 60 bud.
---
Can i do this at lvl 40?
---
My point is world PvP doesn‚Äôt exist. It‚Äôs just a name smooth brains use to make their ganking sound less pathetic. Keep up zug zug.
---
Can't remember it being worse than STV when i think back to the vanilla days, might be different in Classic times
---
Sell portals, food and water in Kargath.
---
What can be done with DireMaul runs as warrior/something duo ? 
---
Can warrior do any form of dungeon farming solo ? 
---
Can warrior/mage duo do some farming in DireMaul ?
---
High end gear might be an issue as I won't be raiding as say don't have the time.
---
Will be doing bgs when they come out. So I will b in pre raid bis most of the time
---
I don't know much about desolate but barrens has quite a few mountains buildings and other shit in the way to afk it imo
---
How is your rotation? Do you use an autoshot timer?
---
This makes a much bigger difference than spec/gear.
---
Ironically dark souls of all games has this. You have players so skilled (in dark souls) that they barely need to level more than a couple of times to finish the game beating down lower skilled players (like myself and my brother when we played) that they don't need to level up to insane levels to become powerful.
---
In dark souls, PvP has brackets. You can only be matched up against people within a range of your own level, but it doesn't matter because there are players so skilled that they're able to beat the game at low levels and outfit themselves with insane gear. Meanwhile they're being matched up against players who have starting weapons and armor and only fought the tutorial boss (though that's not to say the tutorial boss is a pushover, this IS still dark souls).
---
In WoW however, there are no brackets and you have very high leveled players who may have mediocre skills beating down on low leveled players who may have better skills but obviously poor access to good gear and weaker skills (I still remember one video where a level 50 human mage manages to defeat a level (60? The level was ?? to her, but at 50 that sounds like he must have been 60) troll shaman. Perhaps mages are OP against shamans, but that level gap means the shaman is resisting a ton of spells. Skill won out despite the gap).
---
tl;dr
---
Dark souls, where the skill is the real indicator of who's going to win and yet there's a PvP level range.
---
And WoW, where a massive level advantage and the gear that comes with it being the real indicator of who's going to win having NO PvP bracket (outside of battlegrounds).
---
The 15% stamina and 20% health stone buffs are really nice in demonology, if you dungeon a lot the 3/3 improved imp is also great
---
Did the survey allow people to select multiple roles?  If you asked me what I was doing at 60 I‚Äôd tell you that I planned to be/am a (fury) DPS warrior, but I‚Äôve tanked 85%+ of my instance runs, and off-tanked in the MC raids I‚Äôve been in.
---
Your point generally is totally right though - good tanks get geared way more quickly than the rest of the population because of the pre-existing scarcity of tanks generally, and the problem spirals out of control for a million reasons intimately related to this, and not just due to the ‚Äúcommunity is toxic‚Äù reasons that OP suggests.
---
Not really sure but mages aoe runs or solo runs are common on my server so i dont really know.
---
dude I was legit about to comment that but couldn't remember Mermaid Man's name lmao, legit so true
---
I bet Hong Kong protestors feel the same way right now.....
---
As a 52 wl, what group should i be looking for in brd?
---
It is all about experience. You are always a damage dealer out in the world, so you know that role. I've been a tank for a good while now, so there is very little stress involved.
---
But I have to agree that one of the most chilled runs for me has been LBRS after I told the group I have no idea about the shortcuts. Someone stepped up and always marked which group to pull and lead the way to them. It doesn't have to be the tanks job.
---
In the run before nobody stepped up when I mentioned my lack of knowledge, so I just ended up following what seemed to be the path further in, pulling whatever seemed to be in the way of getting there. The run probably took quite a bit more time than it needed to, but nobody complained. While I sometimes read people expect tanks to read up a dungeon and know all the paths before ever entering it, but I haven't met those people yet.
---
Oh, but it does
---
Being a retarded damage greeder must be sad. Now fuck off, kiddo
---
&gt; i have tailoring so the cloth isnt really profit
---
of course it is.  it's your choice to 'waste' it on leveling tailoring instead of selling it....  You can say to yourself, ok,  I'll pick up tailoring again after I have bought my mount.

---
**Introduction**  
---
Cyrus was founded over ten years ago back in early 2009, and has enjoyed success in MMO's such as Warhammer Online, Aion, Rift and World of Warcraft. Originally a PvP guild, over the years we learned to appreciate the joys and drama of raiding - and some of us have even learned to stop standing in the lava. You can read more about our history at the link below:
---
[https://www.cyrus-gaming.com/history/](https://www.cyrus-gaming.com/history/)
---
Following something of a general lull in the MMO scene over recent years, we are now beyond hyped to be turning the clocks back and recapturing our wasted youths in World of Warcraft Classic. It's not often you get a second go at things in life, so while we might not still fit into the same pair of skinny jeans we did 15 years ago, we are certainly going to take this opportunity by the horns and throw ourselves into some classic old-school guild life!
---
\*\*Raid Schedule (UK Times)\*\*  
---
Monday - PvP Night  
---
Wednesday - 7.20pm to 11pm  
---
Thursday ‚Äì Dependant on progress  
---
Sunday ‚Äì 7.20pm to 11pm
---
We will also organise Battlegrounds and World PvP nights.
---
**Member Expectations**  
---
Cyrus is a focused, progression-based guild for mature, skilled and team-orientated players. We have a long-established leadership committed to getting the most out of our members and ensuring everyone is working towards their own and the common goals of the guild.
---
Our raid schedule reflects that of a more grown up / responsible lifestyle, but we still expect members to be highly active, to participate in other guild activities and to ensure they are fully stocked and ready for when it's go time. You‚Äôll need a thick skin, a good sense of humour, the discipline to know when to speak up, when to shut up and the dedication to constantly improve.

I would personally farm Mithril Ore (Or buy it). I remember when I did my Engineering for the BiS Helmet, when I got to the Mithril ore in Engineering that's when I realized that I needed to farm the ore because buying it at the time of around 30-40 was like 5gold for a stack of 20 and that was way too much Gold for me to just spend. 
---
[Tipsout has an excellent engineering guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m-E4XlS-0U)
---
Basically you want Gnomish, They is no way in hell you take Goblin first, as some of the Gnomish gadgets are so fun to use and so game changing in PvP. Such as the Trinket to shoot a lightning bolt. Very fun to kill some players.
---
Goblin you take later because when PvP is released (Battlegrounds most importantly) The Bombs you can make are disgustingly OP.
---
Obviously they is certain items you can only use with Gnomish Engineering and Vice Versa.
---
But Engineering is a very long profession to grind just due to the fact you have to do it twice.
---
mage
---
Oh, you have no space? Tell this engineer druid with 3 gear sets how full are your bags
---
Warlock and Priest was a lot of fun for me.
---
Again, depending on the class and level! Personally I love challenging myself to take down elites as hunter/warlock etc, might have to outlevel in certain cases but its super fun!
---
Oh  i was thinking of hunters increasing range with talents. 
---
Didn't know mages get increased range from fire talents (didn't lvl mage past 10 yet to check talents). TIL
---
No, it‚Äôs really not
---
Yeah. But questing for 2 days without mount is faster than farming for 4 days to get the mount and then quest.
---
If you're any good as an alchemist, you'll be buying the herbs on the AH that make the potions that sell at a profit.
---
If you arent a good alchemist, then more herbs will only lead to more auction house fees as unsold potions are returned.
---
You can certainly make decent money with mining, but check your local auction house to see prices.
---
Skinning is lower effort, as dead animals just mysteriously appear around adventurers.
---
I'd recommend against enchanting to go with tailoring, unless it's really really your thing, because paying for two sets of skills and losing the cash flow from auctioning cloth and losing the cash flow from auctioning unwanted magic items will really, really hurt.
---
-25-25%
---
When I look at phase 2 bis is just lists MC gear
---
Excuse me but I'm a Tauren tyvm, we're not all Orcs and Undeads, my second choice would even be Troll!
---
Ugh im glad you have this experience, im alliance on ten storms EU and i curse the day my friends wanted to avoid the queue times just to play on a server which has none. Now, it's alliance population is so low I doubt there will be 1 guild going aq40 or something, i rarely see alliance outside of stormwind, if all, and groups as a TANK take forever to form (i've spent 1:30h forming a mara princess run on a saturday). Maybe it's just my bias but I would never roll on a medium or a new server.
---
the most impressive part of this clip is that it took you longer than 3 minutes to kill rag in the first place
---
I used to play on a laptop like that, i just didn't own a desktop at the time. I didn't even use a mousepad lol, I just used the couch. it was like a big mousepad.
---
I get my essence when I no longer need to enter MC? Tight.
---
All of this, plus roughly a third of all clothies are tailors.
---
&gt; Do you have any plan on how to deal with the massive queues we still have (on EU it's usually around 1-2 hours)? 
---
They offered realm transfers from high pop to low pop.  
---
Your own fault IMHO if you didn't used that, so you should deal with the consequences, or wait for a new transfer round.
---
Yes; that‚Äôs what I thought reading your post. That‚Äôs why I said spriest is pretty nice without high end gear. There is a good list from ooze with that you will do fine imo
---
I am Troll Shaman, currently 42 lvl on Mograine, sitting on 50 gold. And I just don't give a F about 60\^ mount, as I have my ghost form. I am buying all of my spells, all crafting reciepes which are available for me, maxing professions, etc.
---
THIS IS MY PACE. And I am okay with it.
---
Who's with me?
---
It's surprising how ignoring the need for gold somehow ends up with more gold. I ignored my need for gold and next thing you know: I'd already gained a few more gold.
---
Although it does help to note that doing dungeons helps a LOT. The junk you get in there vendors for a fair bit, and of course if you're fortunate, you may just replace your own gear with better stuff.
---
Just give it a go dude, I've played in every starting zone possible and got several toons on boths sides to 60+ over the many years I've played wow. Never understood why people will religiously play 1 faction only. Gnome/dwarf starting zone is my favourite for ally, UD for horde.
---
The last good fallout game ever made, even with the shitty old piece of garbage graphic engine from bethesda and the short time they had to finish the project, thanks to Obsidian came out as a masterpiece.
---
Thx moose
---
gnomish: more utility trinkets and gadgets 
---
goblin: more things that go booooooooom!
---
and they have different teleporters, one goes to Tanaris and the other to Winterspring, the Tanaris one will be nice for when you reach AQ raiding, as an 'extra hearthstone'
---
Which you and everyone else knows about. Completely farmed empty.
---
This comment coming from a guy named Rommel... I can see the tanks rolling through the desert towards Gadgetzan.
---
PS: I'm a little afraid now.
---
Dont join their group then.
---
Maybe only idiot dps are willing to join runs where they'll make zero gold because everything is reserved. Or undergeared dps who are willing to forego gold because they still need gear. I don't join tank reserve runs and I rarely play with idiot dps.
---
What's the meta build for Paladin pvp? I'm guessing holy at the very least until consecration and hybridize into ret? Holy Shock seems cool too though.
---
Assuming that Prot Pally is literally the single worst pvp spec in the whole game, if not the worst spec period
---
You need to mention the realm so we can blacklist him
---
Ironic. The meme with the poorly drawn figures making fun of the horde on this sub seems accurate.
---
Leadership roles in real life typically come with some incentives for dealing with the increased responsibilities.  The WoW populace seems very salty about yielding these incentives to tanks, however, and some tanks allow themselves to be convinced or badgered into not getting what they‚Äôre worth.  I imagine it gets old very quickly.
---
Not alone. :D
---
Okay but if people wanna play that way whats the problem? Go roll a PvE server if you dont want to gank/get ganked. Its really that simple.
---
As a palading tank, dungeons are simple. Put wisdom on the healer and salvation on everyone else. Group up mobs and spam consecrate while keeping mana up with SoW and JoW. All that remains is to accept the adulation of the masses as they aoe to their hearts content.
---
I'm going to say disregard normal farming, and perhaps start joining groups for dungeons. The trash you get in there vendors for a fair bit (it helps to have an addon that tells you how much each item is worth so you can destroy stuff worth only a few copper, or even just 1 silver). Best case scenario, you'll also replace your current gear with better stuff.
---
Basically didn‚Äôt you do the same thing with your post about how annoyed you are with the classic experience? But then I see you are also a p2w player. Makes sense.
---
I feel like that bit is relevant to the story.
---
I use the addon "shadowed unit frames" which gives you several options on how to display your target.
---
I think you can switch between 2D, 3D (animated) and the class symbols. I dont know if there are any solutions for classic unit frames.
---
Thats 100% how it is. Its called terrain exploiting and WILL get you banned.
---
Let him die you still get your quest done quicker.
---
Same as a priest, just run through. Shield and renew will be more than enough. I was 60, though.
---
I don't even know how I would react to that... It goes beyond scumbag to a whole other level.
---
While the mage gets most of the hate here (and blacklist that motherfucker everywhere) I see 3 ninja roles total in there. In my eyes the warrior would be the only one who should have it - MAYBE some consideration for the rogue. That shaman (looks like one at least) can go suck a bag of dicks though.
---
By all means go on a roof and attack people for an hour and tell me the results then.
---
This comment is healer approved.
---
People need something to complain about.  
---
Also these people probably never take the time to create their own group..  
---
Just let them cry.... (tears reserved ! )
---
Generally speaking, what is more efficient as my gear +healing or +spirit and int? Assuming gear is the same level
---
Yeah I don't know about that. I (Priest) had a druid(2 levels above) attack me while I was doing an escort quest in the middle of me being attack. I turned and unloaded on them. I think they were surprised to because they got low and then tried to heal which I then silence and then the died. I was at 25% health. However I am geared and spec'd for pvp so I wouldn't judge a class to quickly.
---
Who gives a fuck about custom channels?
---
Nah, the [Medicine Pouch](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16768/furbolg-medicine-pouch) is an absolute must-have for PvP. You need honored for that.
---
And As It Is Such, So Also As Such Is It Unto You
---
Is that APES using the raid xp exploit?
---
Found the cheater.
---
Dance in your main city and yell dancing for 10g! Some guy will come up to you and trade it. I did that and managed to get about 200 Gold.
---
What's wrong with desolace in particular?
---
I know, but many groups wont do that.
---
\+healing, unless you're dps.
---
Who?
---
I heard that it makes you super smart.
---
It's irrelevant to me which wing he's on now. I was just making fun of how he talks to make himself appear smarter than he actually is and it's so obvious it can be seen through text on the internet.
---
Only for ranged attacks lol
---
I legit started playing Path of Exile on my 2nd monitor while I was leveling my Paladin in the Kurzen camp...
---
I killer them in hillsbrad because I was running to alterac after the shit fest that was STV.
---
All horde must hang.
---
Really? Does losing the extra points of mama regenerate isn't less benefitial on the long run?
---
A great defensive option. For a more offensive option, go down the destruction tree and pick up Bane and Shadowburn
---
60 Warrior tank.  
---
been 60 for 2 weeks now, with 17 days  on /played
---
I don't know where to begin about whats wrong with tbc. as you say it "fixed so many core problems" i always thought it did the opposite.
---
hope you enjoy shattrash city again tho :)
---
In every single one of the posts, there's always some pserver turd arguing that it's not cheating, even tho safespotting was actually banned on pservers.
---
In this thread its /u/spudds96. Hey spudds, you're wrong, everyone else is right, eat a dick, huh?
---
Don't think there's any way to give a definite answer to that. Depends on class, overall stat distribution, level and difficulty of content, group comp and ability, fight length and other factors. You would be better off googling "your class spec +stat weights +classic wow" or something like that and reading up on the topic.
---
No one feels they are good at pvp when they kill players who are lower level than them. They do it because its a way to be an asshole without real life repercussions.
---
I was hitting /lie as a lvl 35 stealth kitty near Sin'Dall's spawn waiting for her so i can do Tiger Mastery, when i saw a lvl 45 orc warrior jumping around me, obviously seeing me. I hit that sweet /wave and continue being a comfy kitty, when the bastard rudely interrupts my nap and kills me.
---
I walk back, tried to be sneaky and get the jump on him, but failed, and got killed again. And i wasn't the only one. He was camping that particular spot for a good while, killing everyone. He was positively the talk of /1.
---
Well, joke's on him, 3/4 of the zone ended up chasing him around the entirety of STV and corpse-camping him, and he probably made it onto several dozen kill-on-sight lists that night. Sucks to suck, compadre.
---
This is the reason as a Tank I started creating my own pug groups. I just avoid other groups looking for tank... It is much easier when I am organizing the raid and setting the rules upfront. I make it clear from the beginning that it is not a speed run and DPS should wait a bit before going crazy on damage. This way no one complains later on or if they are not fine with this they just leave while the group is forming.
---
The main point of +healing is that you can use lower ranks of spells for comparable output.
---
Priest, mainly spirit stacked
---
##notallmages
---
Kinda stupid to ask him to attack your target. Then he will need to constantly target you and see what you target since tank change target to spread threat.
---
As an warrior i can say Druid Bear tank is the best dungeon Tank.  
---
I love bear tanks because they can hold aoe aggro so much better then warrior tanks.  
---
As an fellow tank shout out to all bear tank; i love you !  
---
( But ill tank raid bosses &lt;3 )
---
My experience of being shunted was not being invited to kill specific bosses I'd benefit from and the guild recruiting another class of better gear who'd get raid priority. This was after a handful of months in the guild. I quietly slipped away as my interest in them had dropped due to being neglected and ignored. I should have raised hell as I never interacted with any of them since. I used to be afraid of burning bridges.
---
It's like 10th time there's a post from this cave. Please stop.
---
For wow classic i decided to train myself with ESDF, and it's been fine. But why not go one step further and do RDFG? then you get more bindable keys to the left.
---
And both get a free mount which is a bonus
---
So much this. Everyone knows they're gonna get ganked on PvP servers, yet you still get all these weak minded people complaining about it. It's like watching a vegan go to a steakhouse and complaining about meat being on the menu
---
Depends on if you're healing in organized PvP or going solo. Ret/prot is probably better solo, with holy/prot being better in groups.
---
Well then. Guess I was wrong
---
I really didn't put much thought into my roll and hit greed so I wouldn't slow my party down (I didn't think deeply on how my abilities work and felt guilty about rolling for it because I thought perhaps I won't use it). I was using the blue mace from WC in the off-hand and it had 30-(something) damage range, however now when I think about it, I realize 'hang on, sinister strike + riposte + eviscerate doesn't use my OH weapon's damage at all, only my MH'.
---
I could've gotten an upgrade and screwed up :(
---
And the worst of it is, I hate RFK and I really don't want to run it again. Tons of mobs that chain agro, uninteresting design (compared to BFD, SM, Stockades (even though I can't go there as horde, I still think it's awesome) and such), and that really, really awful escort quest that has you killing boars for what feels like an eternity.
---
The GOOD news is that a rare mob spawn in SM GY has a one-handed mace (one handed! Not main hand! So I want two of them!) I absolutely want and I don't mind farming that instance for it. He also has a ring that I would love to win twice. Looks like I'm parking my toon outside SM GY and running that for a short eternity :p
---
It's not coming out on tuesday?
---
I had a nightmare that my ISP went down just before my guilds first Rag kill whilst I had prio on Peridition's blade. Oh wait that actually happened. And it dropped...
---
Heyy, that's pretty neat!
---
Try to keep close to 100% mana at all times. What level are you?
---
For lower levels your strongest heal is typically your most mana efficient, so don't heal the tank until the tank is (MAX\_HP - HEAL), then throw a renew on there and exploit the five second rule so you can wait as long as possible before you throw your next heal. Keep in mind that renew is not very mana efficient so you generally don't want to use it so much, but in this case it will let you wait longer until the next time the tank is (MAX\_HP - HEAL) which will let you regen more. If you DO have spirit tap try to wand mobs as well, you might get the last hit every now and then.
---
Never shield or use flash heal unless somebody is about to die.
---
Some skills do dmg based on the weapons hit dmg (displayed by the damage range) while their ressource cost is untouched.   
---
That means, that skills with for example 150% weapon dmg deals more dmg with slow weapons, because they have a much higher range than fast weapons.
---
Warrior + healer can 2man DME bosses which is really good gold. you need mining + enchanting  and optionally herbalism to optimize gph. So usually the healer gets enchanting (you just need 1/300), and the warrior gets mining.
---
Anyone leveling an alt on a different realm? Wanting to level a Sham alt.
---
Might end up being more hassle than it‚Äôs worth.
---
I actually forgot as well that my main abilities don't care about the damage range of my OH weapon. I made a terrible mistake not rolling for it.
---
Gay if you read this bart.
---
I'll be waiting
---
Does the X number of plus equals to the total of hp added? For example +40 gear will add 40hp to my 100-120 healing spell?
---
He's passive. I MCed an Alliance guy and walked him right next to Rexxar and dropped MC. Didn't do anything.
---
Yea that's only thing I can do as I don't have the time to sit for hours for raiding in on sitting. So Pvp is going to be the main goal for classic for me.
---
Don't worry about it. I know that place. The gradual change to that eerie demonic hue is pretty cool! Unique effect.
---
imagine skipping potential epic drops with having a mage in your grp who can solo this room :D
---
&gt;I dunno man. I guess I just have a thicker skin than you do.
---
Yeah I bet that someone who is too afraid to say no to randoms have thicker skin than I do.
---
&gt;I rolled and got both rend swords from pug groups and this was after I lost them previously.
---
Great anecdote mate. Really smart. You got incredibly lucky, so what?
---
&gt;I'm not gonna be a little bitch and make a group that revloves around me because I'm the group leader and/or tank.
---
No you are instead gonna be the little bitch with 0 respect for his own time.
---
&gt;This is what everyone signed up for. This is classic WoW.
---
Second most retarded thing I've read in a week.
---
&gt;You are completely able to reserve all the items you want, but don't be shocked when someone calls you out on that kind of behavior.
---
As I just explained, there is literally nothing fucking wrong with reserving items. And you can't give me a single reason to why it is either. Wanting to invite a player of a different class = bad behavior???????
---
&gt;So, you're telling me you had to make reserve groups to farm your BiS? Lmao.. I'm sorry about that friend.
---
Lmao.. I was done three weeks ago. As I said, please link me your gear :)
---
Volley does arcane damage also. I wonder if it can proc from each individual hit. One full Volley cast could get you back to full mana!
---
Bait the spellock with poly at start (if he doesnt take the bait your only chance is go ahead with the nuke anyway, shadowreflector might save you once he does schoollock you in frost.. but generally i dont see you winning vs a lock unless he waste his spelllock early). 
---
If he does take the bait just frostnova+tidal charm. Do your first shattercombo. -&gt;fireblast+block whatever he casted on u during that fireblast gcd, be it deathcoil, dot or fear.
---
Coldsnap+frostnova+counterspell (need to have improved for 4sec silence). 
---
Proceed with another shattercombo (fb+coc).
---
After shattercomo do your stungrenade (try hit both lock and pet if possible.
---
Cast your last frostbolt+fireblast.
---
Aespamm+sappercharge+gnomishdeathray. (he needs to die here). 
---
this is jsut one way. But you basicly have 4 tools vs the lock to allow you to nuke him. Imp CS, shadowreflector, tidal charm stun, and lastly stun grenade.
---
Paladin.
---
\+100 HP is better for Warrior tanks and anyone who does PvP. Even if you prefer threat as a tank, 4 str + 4 agi is a downright pathetic increase to your threat per second. 
---
I still like 4 stats on my Druid, but I have an alternate chest piece in my bags with +100 HP on it. I don't think you could fault a DPS for running +100 HP full time if they like to PvP too.
---
Seriously, how have people missed this island? It's integral to getting ZG rep...
---
&gt; because at least they didn't do a ton of AoE aggro and could feign if they pulled. Now it's mages who easily pull AoE aggro and can't drop the aggro once they pull it.
---
I feel what you're saying - but decent mages have Ice Block x2, Frost Nova x2 and Ice Barrier x2 in the frost talent tree. It's not like they *can't do anything and just die*, or if they do they're shit mages.
---
Source: Am mage.
---
I didn't put any thought into my roll and made a mistake. I didn't consider that my OH would not affect my sinister strike (or other instant abilities) damage and should've rolled for it. I made a hasty decision because I didn't want to slow the group. Worst part is that the dagger dropped in RFK, and I *never* want to run RFK again.
---
Same, cry's in Earth bind totem
---
thrash blade at level 45 is all you need. Rogue DPS is fine at level 45 in maraudon because of the precision talent.
---
&gt; my pizza parties
---
EternalEnvy?
---
It is lol
---
I've always believed that poaching only gets players who'll stab the guild in the back if it means they go further. I have rarely seen evidence that suggests otherwise.
---
You mean Feralas? Because he was running towards north, but then the rogue shifted him towards south
---
I'm not 100% sure on what rogues take but I do know Combat is very good to level with the Sword Spec and in Raiding too.
---
And around 40-50 I think they is a quest in Desolace for the [Thrash Blade](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17705/thrash-blade)
---
Yeah in all honesty your OH damage matters very little while leveling, something fast for poisons (and eventually making sure its a sword for sword procs) is all that matters.
---
It‚Äôs the warrior Whirlwind Sword from the level 30 quest.
---
Each spell has a coefficient. Longer cast times and over-time spells benefit more from +spell power, you can find the exact coefficients on wowhead. Lower rank spells also get less of a bonus, but it's still worth it to use them in the right situations.
---
How often does it happen to you, that mobs see straight through vanish?  
---
As in: Resist &gt; Sprint away &gt; Vanish and they see straight through it.
---
amazing üòÅ
---
My monkey pet Robin has tanked BRD Arena runs since L57. With a little bit more consideration it works great! Some people note it goes smoother than with a "real tank". By the end of the runs it's "thx Robin", "Great job Robin".
---
I then tell my Real Life friend Robin and he just rolls his eyes. üòÅ
---
Just because something is temporary doesn‚Äôt mean it isn‚Äôt meaningful :)
---
1.12 tuning but 1.0 QOL updates, wtf are they even thinking
---
Also, how are you finding so many weapon upgrades? I upgraded my weapon like 5 times while leveling to 60. One example is i got the uldaman gun and skipped the mara gun because it was like 1.something dps higher and fired way faster.
---
The hammer of grace. Seems like every other healer who can use it has one. It‚Äôs just too deep in brd for me to bother with
---
Everyone is used to the easybwow where tanks are top dps. It actually takes a little coordination in classic and I miss it to be honest. Although I pride myself on well placed cleaves tab targets and stance dancing.
---
No, bad players are a waste of space.
---
If the cast is 3 seconds or more you get the full bonus power
---
A humanoid is a humanoid
---
This. Just click 'use raid style party frames'
---
Interface&gt;Raid Profiles at the top maybe
---
you know raw means uncooked, right?
---
You won't get much +healing at this level. It will start popping up more closer to 50, but it won't be enough to make a big difference and absolutely not enough to start downranking. It's still a good stat, you just don't get much of a choice there.
---
For questing, spirit is far superior to int, but for dungeon healing you want a good mix of both so you don't run out of mana on big pulls.
---
Depends on a lot of factors. Spells have different spell power coefficients based on. Typically it‚Äôs (BaseCastTime(max 3,5 sec) * 100) / (3,5 * 100). 
---
So a spell with a base casttime of 3,5 secs get 100% coefficient, while one with 2,5 secs would get ~71%. Keep in mind that the upper limit is 3,5 secs, so you can never gain more than 100% efficiency from spell power.
---
Thanks! I've never leveled a warrior but was considering it.
---
Earthshaker EU
---
What level do you recommend doing sm gy?
---
Even with DKP I have never seen a guild that didn't stack MT and main OT, that's just a given in any guild regardless of system. 
---
Generally if you have a balanced raid cross class items aren't a massive problem, I have never been in a situation where a hunter was able to outbid a rogue or warrior on every dps trinket/jewelry etc. Any items like that are going to go for a lot of dkp, so once someone has bid enough on a highly sought item they won't be able to do the same on the next drop.
---
Pretty low on the list compared to all the current class bugs I'd assume
---
No, you need to find "spell coefficient" for this spell to find how much would be added.  
---
For example Healing Touch(Rank 1) have 40% coefficient, so you will get +16 healing. And Healing Touch(Rank 4) get 100% coefficient.
---
Me too
---
I've had more groups compliment me and add me to their friends list than I have had flame, but it has happened and yes it was a mage.
---
Druids are really good tanks in phase 1 though.
---
Alternatively you can immediately do goblin and buy the gnome trinkets from a gnome engineer.
---
IIRC only 3 gnome engi items are BOP (Deathray, battlechicken, teleporter gadgezan). If you fon't need these then go goblin.
---
To be fair, I dominated a level ?? (\~35) Human Mage yesterday in Arathi Highlands as a level 20 Undead Warlock on my way to doing the Succubus quest.
---
I clocked him blinking in the distance behind me, steadily closing the gap as my rickety dead legs went ten to the dozen, and when death was inevitable I thought sod it, the least I can do is try to get a fear off and hope he doesn't resist it to create some distance.
---
Long story short, my love affair with Fear in Classic turned very sexual; three Fears, a bunch of dots and one bemused, polymorphed me later and he was gone. Dead.
---
^(Do spells resist less in PvP or was I extremely lucky that everything landed? The level ?? spiders and raptors resisted everything I threw at them, I had to pull aggro with (then sacrifice) my big, beautiful blueberry boi to stand a chance...)
---
I watched that 3 times a few days ago to rule out mistakes on my side. The runs are okay now i terms of getting spotted, my current issue is, that mobs see straight through vanish
---
I think that only happens, when the first vanish gets cancelled due to spell batching
---
35 runs. seen offhand drop 4x and MH 2x. 
---
Rolled 1 the first time ( i wanted to cry but the other rogue was so kind it was hard to hate him) and 100 the second time. the drop rate is 3-4 percent. best to spam it with Jed runs.
---
I am going back to private servers if they force us to play TBC.
---
I don‚Äôt think I need my right of passage 12 times in a row my some body camping rogue douche
---
I love the way dwarfs scream, makes everything sounds like an urgent irresistable offer.
---
Don't downrank unless you want to avoid overhealing. Your biggest available heal will always be the most efficient one until you get ~230 +healing. More importantly, using only big heals means you get more downtime between casts and can start regenerating mana if tank isn't taking too much damage.
---
Haha that‚Äôs be ace
---
I think the difference now is that the culture is different. A mage pulling aggro by casting blizzard while the tank is in the middle of a LOS pull would have gotten a "Dude! WTF are you doing?" from at least 2 other people in the group 15 years ago. Now it's just a shrug.
---
Just a side note. A few weeks ago, some guy ~25ish in hillsbrad put together 15+ other 20's and we killed a 60 warrior. 
---
Takes a raid group to do it...but its possible!
---
You gain attack power and block value from Strength, that's it.
---
Not for me. It's a global keycombo on Plasma, kinda like alt tab.
---
Content? He's just killing a boss and resetting, literally what happens at 60 when farming for gear.
---
Ban'thok Sash and Cyclopean Band.
---
Done over 20 Arena runs so far, saw both items drop exactly 1 time each and each time the roll was won by the Priest (different Priest on each).
---
I know that would be the icing on the cake
---
Usually whenever a ?? Horde passes me by on BlooMoo, they just look at me, laugh, and then run away lmao
---
Keep renew on the tank only, and never ever PWS unless someone is about to die. Don't downrank until 60, you'll just confuse yourself and be inefficient. Wait until people are at 50% then hit them with a big Heal, if you try to top people off constantly you're just going to oom. If 3 or more people are moderately hurt then Prayer of Healing is very efficient.
---
(Rolls eyes) no it‚Äôs not.
---
Not untill threat on all mobs is guaranteed. I rather get slapped for more dmg, then have a mob run of and go berserk on the dps..
---
Also getting slapped for more dmg is more rage is faster threat on all mobs. In general you take the most dmg at the start of the fight and then it goes down (fast) when aggro has been established.
---
It gives you big advantage...smart players will use their aoe and thanks to the addon might stop rogue/druid from opening,something they wouldn't do otherwise .Like demo shouts etc
---
This image gives me neck and back pain üòñ
---
If you do it like the others in the comments said and you still have problems with aggro its not your fail. Sometimes you will have some idiot party members which are pulling or instant starting aoe damage then its their fail.   
---
Take always a look on the healers mana before you pull a new group and if your higher level you can support your healer with innervate.
---
If you want engaging raid content play retail, classic raids are a fucking joke, you could literally join any dogshit guild on whatever realm you picked and clear MC in one night with no troubles.
---
Renew is quite ineffective for hp/mana.  
---
If you didn't go into Disciple tree for 15% mana regen in battles - you need to conserve mana and follow 5-seconds rule.  
---
So throw few heals, then wait 5+ second without casting, just shooting from your want to get some mana back.  
---
Or get a paladin in the group)
---
I don't know how this post came of as sarcasm to some of you guys.
---
so you are complaining that you are stacking massive amounts of world buffs on top of normal enchants and raid buffs as well as consumable buffs.... 
---
I mean I get the point, but at the same time maybe you should check out what it feels like to be outside bro.
---
I definitely read it in their announcement. It's coming with DM.
---
That icon for skill number 3..
---
How does spirit tap works for you in dungeons? I avoided this skull so far to be honest
---
ITT: BuT tHe HoRdE!!!!!!1!1!11one
---
Agree. I rate the tank and group in general by how bored I am. The longer I have to wait to heal anyone the better.
---
Skinning is a pretty good option as you‚Äôll need leather to make some tailoring patterns, and can sell all the leather you don‚Äôt need.
---
I‚Äôm stuck at first aid 59/75 the linen cloth to make bandages won‚Äôt level me any higher for some reason
---
At 42 stack intellegence until you have a mana pool of 3.8k then spirit. Spirit is good for hp but no point in having a strong amount of hp without a decent mana pool. At 50 you want 4.3k mana and at 55 you want 4.5k around 58 start picking up +healing gear but don't use it until 60 and until you have a lot of pieces. +healing is best paired with deranked healing as most of your heals will come from that +healing and it will reduce your overheals and allow you to conserve mana for the entire fight. 
---
Healing is more complicated than just stacking one stat.
---
Always thought it was a shame the sword was the fastest weapon and therefore the worst choice. Not a fan of that bloody axe as an alliance. No racial benefit and just doesn't suit.
---
Pre BiS means the gear you would typically want to get from dungeons that will best suit you to get into raiding. Wowhead has been my go to site for pre raid BiS gear. I am rolling Heart of the Wild spec.
---
The music makes me think i\`m watching a League of Legends compilation.
---
the quest reward comes from completing the cathedral. I do not bother with the graveyard unless I have a group for a full clear or some friends wanna carry me. leveling melee classes is hard, and the competition is tough all the way through, but hey, mana sucks.
---
That's clearly not pvp. That's fun.
---
I haven't necessarily seen tanks get flamed.  However I think the main reason we're seeing a severe tank shortage is because its the only role that's just as hard if not harder on classic than on retail (due to aggro mechanics).  DPS is obviously pretty straightforward and hard to screw up.  Healing is much easier on classic than healing something like a M15.  As long as you know how to manage mana its hard to screw up. But with tanks, its probably pretty frustrating to see mobs running all over the place without really being able to control them especially with this AOE meta.
---
&gt; He is not a bad man and his intentions has always been good.
---
Aside from the labor violations and abuse of women that is.
---
Can get this from the vault, if you're 60 there are videos to get there with very minimal killing.
---
You have to land the killing blow. It's primarily a solo talent, and a must have one if you ever plan to do quests or farm mobs by yourself. In dungeons you can also trigger it by sniping low health enemies with wand but it's not nearly as reliable.
---
I start single target dps on the designated target, then send in my monkey, have him Thunderstomp and (provided it's not resisted) only THEN do I do a Multi Shot. Because I know my pet can keep that amount of aggro.
---
Pet gets hammered on occasion, but that's still better than mobs running towards me, me having to Feign Death causing those mobs to seek a new target. Like that squishy healer next to me.
---
Pre-Bis means pre-raiding best in slot.
---
Taladril's list is excellent, keep in mind that not all items on it are currently in the game.
---
Combined it with ideas from [Wowclassicbis.com] (http://www.wowclassicbis.com/) and you should be able to form a decent idea.
---
&gt;IIRC only 3 gnome engi items are BOP (Deathray, battlechicken, ...  
---
&gt;Deathray
---
What happened to Divine Favor (Paladin talent) giving me glowing hands? Was it removed in a previous patch, or added in a later one?
---
First time I saw this it was a snake. Straight up looks funky to watch a snake slither at light speed.
---
I actually got the band this weekend too, but out of all my Arena spam I only saw the belt, and ring one time.
---
this sound like ally problems
---
This cuts deep...think I'll have it by 45 if I just run ZF another six times
---
It's not that deep, mate.
---
The pants and the hit % ring.   Which both aren't exactly huge upgrades lol

An instant fear that deals damage and heals the damage dealt?
---
***Perfection.***
---
I like to level with my mount, not level for it.  Just personal preference.
---
Madseason actually made a video about it. With a lot of good points.
---
1. Classic plus can be dangerous. Players still want to experience old vanilla, and dont want changes. (what can they change about vanilla)? more zones/raids? is likely the only option. Or are they gonna make different specs etc more viable and than still you go more the way of TBC. 
---
2. Already made TBC (no money cost ) and population who like TBC will likely be same as population Classic. 
---
3. Make TBC with restrictions or polls whether to add stuff or not. Same like Oldschool runescape.
---
4. Make it that you can transfer your account to a new lvl 70 realm, but it also stays on the lvl 60 realm . with the same gear etc. So u still can play in Vanilla but also have your character get a lvl 70 stuff. this is a great option to not have servers flow out of total population in 1 hit.
---
mob means "mobile", and this dates back decades to MUDs where some opponents were in fact not mobile. It has nothing to do with the literal mob.
---
Gotta get your cute mindslave waifus somehow.
---
that is a reasonable answer.... OP isn't looking for reasonable. he wants it both ways.
---
Eh puggers do cause a lot of issues but the lack of tanks is because the lack of need for them late game, you only need 1-2 main tanks and 2 off tanks so literally 4/40 are tanks.  There just isn‚Äôt a reason to play a tank unless you get into a guild early and cement your spot, are recruited in, or are guaranteed a spot and pushed to make a tank alt
---
You can just use phase 2 tier lists and skip the world boss/pvp stuff.
---
If they don't wave back they get the axe.
---
I tried to change the keybind for mouse camera control, but couldn't find it anywhere. I kind of assume this is similar.
---
Yes, I was here...  Then after we killed Overlord hoping for a gem we snuck into Omokk's room otw out.  If your guild is already in MC, ya I'd be right there with you.  We did 13 runs this weekend, probably 8 on Sunday alone.
---
A matter of perspective I think, there was undoubtedly good and bad, and for many the bad outweigh the good, for others, the reverse.
---
I played Druid and Shaman in TBC, and by far they were better catered to in that expac, they fixed some serious glaring problems with the classes from Vanilla. I thought overall TBC was a net positive.
---
For the positives:
---
* Leveling was designed for a more consistent experience, and there were more quests to do than the levelling permitted, meaning you likely had two full zones you'd barely touched by the time you were 70, although I'm sure many consider this a negative, the haphazard scraping around for quests 50-60 does get quite tiresome.
---
* Arena was a very accessible and fun extra layer of gameplay, some credit the middle of TBC (after a few OP things were fixed and before the last Talent patch) as the best that PvP has ever been.
---
* Classes became more specialized and balanced, pretty much all specs worked, partly thanks to...
---
* Itemization made a lot more sense and you could actually choose your Tier pieces
---
* Heroics were challenging and continued to be until quite late into the gear treadmill.
---
* The difficulty and quality of raids massively improved, fights like Vashj, Kael and many of the BT bosses were both iconic and challenging mechanically. (The fact both factions had paladins and shamans probably made this easier, although discussed in negatives...)
---
* Professions were far more useful and better designed.
---
* The 5-man dungeons were quite well received, Personally I still think that Shattered Halls and Magister's Terrace are two of the best 5-mans Blizzard ever made.
---
* Personally, I think there was more to do (and more interesting things) at 70 without raiding than there is at 60.
---
The negatives:
---
* The old world became largely discarded, with very little reason to go outside of the cities once you were past 60.
---
* Flying mounts have been widely thought of as a bad idea now.
---
* World PvP was a less because of battlegrounds, arena and the fact there was less need to be out farming mobs, herbs, etc. Although to be fair this had already begun in Vanilla.
---
Humanoids usually have better chances for green items, potions, grey weps and armor which sell for a nice bit.  That's why they're preferred.
---
This was my experience too.
---
Mana pots. A fire protection potion helps but not mandatory for the fight. Pretty much that

Play on a pve server ( ‚óú‚Äø‚óù )‚ô°
---
Could they be considering offering premium bag slots?
---
Because 99% of the time the healer has nothing to do besides throw a heal at the tank every once in a while.  DPS taking damage is the only thing that breaks the monotony.
---
As much as I'd love a re-designed TBC with Flying mounts removed, I really don't see it happening.
---
Get grid or any other raid frames addon, let's you do all this. If you want help with grid you can pm me.

Great perk of being a rogue, I don't need most of the keys so I don't bother with them. Once the keyring is in I'll get them, till then screw that.
---
You want to PWS a mage or warlock if they pull aggro, not only does it prevent against potential burst of damage, but also protects their channels.
---
I could never level on alt on a different server. My favorite thing about alts are loading them up with green weapons as they level.
---
Many dungeons when I queue DPS, I can often see just how good/bad the tank is. If they are having a difficult time keeping aggro, then it's often the cause of other DPS. Ultimately though, some tanks are just *bad*, and that's completely understandable. However, not once have I felt the need to flame a tank. Having also tanked most of my dungeons overall, I have not once been flamed either, regardless of how "well" I'm doing.
---
Nah, people don't refuse to tank because they are scared of being blamed. They refuse to do so because it's an extremely frustrating experience due to the varying level of trigger discipline amongst groups. Some groups it's pretty blissful and you get through the dungeon at a record pace because all DPS know to watch their aggro. Other times it's a complete clusterfuck with DPS unloading their burst seconds after pull, all focusing different targets, ignoring marks, with an additional mage in the back just AoEing the while as you're running around trying to collect aggro off of your teammates who are running away.
---
Being a tank is completely at the mercy of your group. It's a sacrificial role with no additional benefit. I've gotten to the point where I would rather spend the better part of an hour looking for a group where I can join as DPS instead of getting into one instantly as a tank, because the experience is just so much more enjoyable that it's worth the additional wait.
---
Is it possible to see party member pet health bars underneath their own health bar?
---
I only saw HoJ once. . . the hunter won it.
---
Emperor's tank trinket has also only dropped once. . . the cat druid won that.
---
I don't even dare think about Ironfoe. The mage will probably win it, if it ever drops.
---
So what are you gonna do with all those precious data you just collected ?
---
I have close to enough money to buy Devilsaur hides from the AH and have a guildie craft me Devilsaur Gauntlets. I'm a Rogue at lvl 52 and have Skinning.
---
Should I just buy the leathers or try to farm them myself in a couple of levels? They're going for around 15g each in my server.
---
That‚Äôs me!
---
I mean I constantly get the chests and ores, the ele pools are much more contested
---
Theres no such thing as a co-leader in WoW.
---
Only the GM can disband the guild. He disbanded the guild. Therefore, he is GM.
---
No "Co-Leader" bullshit.

Hi, /u/Prof__Chen

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dhozzf/that_bug_on_the_small_quivers_selling_price_that/).

Wow so honorable
---
I have the ring, but have lost every roll for the belt so far. Most recently, to a resto shaman.

I go there, then hit winterspring, then back to azshara before returning to org

Bringing Spellcleave mentality into UBRS is fixed really fast -&gt; If you AE 2 Seconds after i pulled a Pack you just graduated yourself to a Tank, GZ!
---
I'm not a slowpoke that wants 10 seconds with 3 Mobs, but if you just frostbolt skull twice and THEN go ham on AE we'd be so much faster.
---
It's been VC since vanilla.
---
Rightful Alliance clay.
---
Cannot find herbs and veins at same time
---
i use the addon neatplates and set the style to original blizzard.
---
everything looks the same but you now see aggro and castbars
---
It‚Äôs not look at the map location is red
---
Yeah they are cool. Levelling is relatively affordable until Thorium 270+ ish... depends on your server economy.
---
Found the corpse camper/lowbie ganker
---
It makes sense. They‚Äôve proven they‚Äôre prepared to jump ship to another guild at a moments notice already, what‚Äôs to say they wouldn‚Äôt do it again? It‚Äôs like dating a cheater. They did it to someone else already... what‚Äôs to say they won‚Äôt do it to you?
---
There's a chart that shows how many skeletons per square meter is on the path to each instance. It's in the game manual.
---
I'm not sure you can solokill a Devilsaur as a 52 rogue. Also I probably wouldn't try to farm them solo in general. They're hotly contested on PvP servers.
---
I understand your statements about rolling on off spec pieces, but just because a healer can wear plate doesn‚Äôt mean that‚Äôs all they must wear. Armour classification bonuses aren‚Äôt a thing in classic and, often, the best in slot items aren‚Äôt plate (or mail, or leather, or whatever).
---
Really? Because i run into these kinds of guys almost every day.  
---
Just yesterday i had a dps going significantly lower than everyone else on the dps because for some reason he absolutely had to train his sword skill by dual-wielding two mediocre swords. I tried to convince him that there were better times to do it, but no.   
---
It would have been fine, dungeons are generally doable as 2 dps and a 2-hand tank without losing much speed, but on top of it he kept pulling extra packs so that the healer was oom and had to drink after every fight.  
---
The whole run ended with him needing on a healer-weapon from the last boss (sm cath) getting it over our healer, wondering why everyone was being mad at him and then spamming me with insults when i kicked him and didn't let him join the next run.
---
smh
---
For the Dark UI i'm using Lorti UI, it darkens your whole UI (every panel, everything). The addon I use to resize and move bars is called Bartender.

I JUST LOOTED STAFF OF JORDAN LOOK AT ME WOOT WOOT

Part of the game

I can guarantee that isn‚Äôt true.  But there are two satyr camps and if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre farming you can also go to felwood and check those two camps as well
---
Lol bro im a warrior i havent even gotten that far
---
Problem with mining/herb is that you can track both nodes at once on the mini map. You'd have to constantly be switching between the two, which would be totally impractical.
---
Skinning plus one of those would be much easier.

A bit of a disclaimer, however. This will never work during combat if that is what you're aiming for, as gear cannot be swapped during active combat (with the exception of weapons)
---
I doubt there will be high demand
---
Then you are stuck wondering, "which Dire Maul wing does he want to go? Does he want to go North? Is it a normal run or a Tribute run?..."
---
You would be wrong lmao
---
I play both sides of the game every expansion. I had thought warmode to be the answer to my prayers, alas it was the same old bullshit with the same shitty people. PvP is basically the only fun I ever have in retail anymore.
---
Eh, 100 hp is not better for warrior tanks. Not in the slightest - I've no idea where the idea that tanks just need to focus on health even came from. +4 all stats is not only increase to threat but to overall mitigation as well. 60 extra health literally doesn't get you nowhere, it doesn't help healers in any way nearly as the tiny addition to dodge, block and armor. Tanks need to be kept at 100% health all the time so what's the difference if a tank has 5200 health or 5260 - the name of the game is to have tank take as few damage as possible while dishing out as much threat as possible, not to just have a useless brick standing in front of the boss.
---
&gt; I don't think you could fault a DPS for running +100 HP full time if they like to PvP too.
---
I really don't see any point on putting PvP enchants on items before P3 since WPvP is mostly "which raid has most sappers wins". But in p3 - yeah, sure.
---
You have earned my sympathy
---
About the only thing that doesn't scale for rogues is poisons. Meanwhile, literally all of the Hunter's kit except for 3-5 abilities doesn't scale. Nobody is cherry picking here.
---
Lothos: "*I've seen some shit*"
---
AoErs need to release that for warrior tanks the absolute minimum time to wait is 1 GCD per mob. This assumes the warrior connects with the sunder on every mob (which is only likely for lower level mobs), and that the warrior has enough rage to do back to back sunders (which isn't always the case depending on availability of blood rage, and whether the warrior avoids the first few hits).
---
So the basic rule is that the amount you have to wait scales linearly with the number of mobs being tanked.
---
It's a shame, dude's talent is wasted on Classic pve. I know they mostly pvp but still, Rikh should be raiding world 1st shit, makes me sad.
---
I don't know, interesting shit ?
---
I am playing enhance for my guild. Totem twisting is when you drop windfury totem for melee, they get the buff and it lasts 9 seconds regardless if the totem stays up. So you drop wf totem and then drop agi totem to give 4% crit while they have windfury. It gives the 4 ppl in your group a TON of dmg.
---
Like mentioned the demonology talents are good. But there are also really good talents in the affliction tree like for example curse of exhaustion and maxing out stuff like hitrate. I would personally not go for shadowburn since 10 talents before that is low value before raids
---
I know itemization sucks, but that makes Spell Hit so much harder to come across.  Not sure I'd be able to keep it together losing on that belt to a healer.....
---
It's kinda full due to me playing on a 15.6" laptop. But I made it to make myself feel comfortable, i'm always making small improvements to it.
---
Stop making so much sense. DPS can't handle logic. Gotta GOGOGOgoogogoo!!11 PU:LL OMG GO ALREADY AAAAAAAAhh
---
I agree with others who say it's not a good comparison, Flying was a game design decision, layering was a technical decision.
---
Flying is required for the Black Temple attunement quest, for example, you'd have to redesign zones, quest chains, daily quest hubs, items, gold sinks, skills (druids got flight form and an epic flight form quest with items too!).
---
It's a much bigger game development task, whereas layering was a far more manageable temporary technical fix.
---
Please DM me the names of all horde smacktalkers / wannabe mafia please. For my blacklist. I will share it with our guildies, and if i notice one in my guild. Kick them.
---
Which is shite, +40 AP.....  Compared to extra swings for Melee....  Load of crap lol...
---
Thanks, that's some very useful stuff, it haven't even occurred to me to look for a healing-focused addon
---
You don't want two hard to level gathering professions that are gonna hang up at certain points.
---
Dealing with that while leveling is gonna be a problem.
---
You need Drak's brand to be attuned to BWL and also an attunement for naxx
---
If you can find the people, you can 5 man up to Rend.... Did it this weekend with some friends.... All of the DPS were about 200 though.....
---
Have you ever heard the phrase, "the Lord yeeteth, the Lord yoinketh away"
---
He must have meant the princess in maraudon. Thats the right dungeon to do at that level.
---
Totally! &lt;3 And a lot of classes did! This is why I think at least classic:TBC and maybe classic:WotLK should be a thing (seperate servers, to keep classic relevant, where you copy your classic character over and/or make a new character (in the case of the new races for example) so you can still play both games). I really love all 3 personally and would play all 3 with multiple characters to complete my goals.
---
You summed up my thoughts...
---
With elvui I see all the targets of my group members, so I always see what the tank is fighting. When in doubt, I just click on whatever target other party members are killing and seems to drop the fastest in health.
---
I find it intense tanking, and I like that
---
Options &gt; Camera &gt; drag the slider to the end
---
&gt;1. kill or attack an ally
---
I was running along a road in Desolace to find Rexxar for the Onyxia quest when I saw three low level alliance. I just passed right by them as I had no intention of ganking them. About five seconds later I see a dead Horde player that had yet to release and I immediately turned around. The moment I turned around, they attempted to scatter because they were clearly watching me while running away to see my reaction to their little deed. They all took the long walk back to their bodies.
---
1.12 abilities but crappy loot tables. No idea why. If they've already changed abilities it makes no sense to gatekeep items they added to dungeon loot tables. No idols or relics kinda sucks
---
Dang I must be doing it wrong cause both ports I asked for they took first offer of 50s. Sorry mages, name your price then.
---
Deadmines was VC in vanilla on most servers and Dire Maul was DM (once Diremaul was out.)
---
I've heard that some servers called Deadmines DM on vanilla...but that wasn't the case on the few different servers I played on.
---
Don‚Äôt use a DKP system... there is a reason people stopped using them 10 years ago.
---
After healing several partial BRD runs with various tanks, I finally cleared it with a pug tank who was a true leader. He took control of every pull, gave out instructions where needed, and everything went so smoothly right to the end. What a boss. He was just like you described.
---
Weird. Even with movespeed enchant she always catches up to me as a druid. I have to go Bear Form and tank a bit to proc her dust cloud thing.
---
Or is the cause that only 2 classes can tank, and there's still a stigma against feral druid tanks, so the vast majority of endgame druids are healers, while there are 2 more healing classes, and anyone can dps. So at this point you're looking for a warrior only, and one that feels like tanking, seeing as most want to just go some dps spec, and never tank.
---
Really, if you don't like tanking, just don't tank, man. Be that asshole with his shield in the bank, or join a guild with 9 other people that want to run ubrs.
---
keep us updated please. we need to force blizzard to stop this behaviour.
---
I like helping Allied as a horde player.
---
Less weird excuse me??
---
And yes there quiet a lot, a lot of your bis items are below 60 until you get raid geared etc
---
Max health helps you survive maximum possible burst without heals. Very important when tanks are not immune to crits and bosses in BWL start to actually hit hard.
---
4 strength and 4 agi is the definition of negligible when it comes to mitigation and threat. You won't even mitigate 60 damage over the course of a 5 minute fight with those stats, not even close. But a tank dropping to 1% health before getting a heal is something that actually happens. That tank would die if he had 4 stats instead of 100 HP.
---
On your 60, turn "Pass on loot". Just right click your player frame.
---
It will arrive when the servers are resetted e.g wednesday in eu
---
Also remember paladin tanks don't have a taunt, so maybe give them a GCD or two before you go all out.
---
Get away from my eyeholes!
---
Having leveled on both RPPvP (ZT) and PvP (Golemagg), I can say that people are *a lot* more peaceful on ZT.
---
On ZT, 90% of people won't attack me even if I get the mob tag or thorium they're aiming for. It's very common to see opposite faction parties simultaneously grinding the Winterfall village and sharing tags. Trying to run into BRM dungeons through hostiles is 50-50.
---
In contrast, on Golemagg I will get ambushed every 10 minutes regardless of what I'm doing. Many people will attack me even if they obviously have no chance, and getting into a dungeon portal through enemies has never worked so far.
---
These people usually go to ignore. Because they spam the same shit for hours.
---
Lol, that brings back memories.  Samwise‚Äôs face is default ‚Äúunknown‚Äù icon if the icon id cannot be found.
---
For solo play it's fine. I prefer a faster speed for mob grinding which is why I keep Willey's Howitzer even tho I have the carapace crossbow
---
Vanilla wow is very sandboxy. Do what ever you like.
---
I always find it empty, purely because it's an absolute ball ache to farm.
---
That helm is awful...how do I get it?
---
if you really thought about horde you would charge 100s of gold for which would make more ppl go for +100 hp which is bettter for pvp
---
Melee names? Hell yeah man!
---
Elvui really is expansive. Wasted couple hours of my life making the perfect UI :D
---
damn absolute master trole XD
---
hmm true I am on pve server so I forgot about wpvp ngl.
---
Exactly. Both Vanilla and TBC servers (and maybe WotLK) separate from each other. That is my dream. So I can play shadow and pala tank and dps pve!
---
We have 2 layers now
---
Vous cherchez plus le Graal ? :p
---
It's still a content patch. We may or may not see a physical download, but for all intents and purposes it's a patch.
---
I just want my god damn keyring man.
---
I support Hong Kong democracy.
---
I'm playing a now level 60 warrior. I thought about prot and tanking but my issue is: My guild is too small to raid, there are no random raids looking for tanks, I'll be stuck being everyones dungeon bitch. Doesnt help that there's a severe lack of tanks on our realm.
---
What's there to do currently in Silithus?
---
Lol made up that whole fucking story and the level 60 is the sweaty nerd? 
---
Hghhaaaa
---
I was on Cho'gall from vanilla through Wrath and transferred around Cata since all of my guildmates and friends had stopped playing, and I was war-weary from years of PvPing xD the guild I ran on that server was all about PvP and we started more than one raid-sized war in contested zones. The good ole days
---
3 satyrs
---
What enchants cause this? Like crusader proc, and such, or even +stats on chest?
---
It's not necessarily layers, it could simply be the dynamic spawn rates that was in classic too.
---
You Okay?
---
It got to the point where if anyone said anything even remotely suspicious to make him think they might be associated with me he would kick them and add them to his shit list. That lasted for at least 2 weeks too!
---
True. But if the priest doesn't understand that you can't tank properly if you're basically shielded off every CD (especially on pulls..) then that's just a risk you'll have to take.
---
Honestly, what I'd probably do is just stop moving and not pull again until the Priest verbally acknowledges in chat that he shouldn't be shielding me unless it's an emergency.
---
This really hasn't happened to me though. I had like maybe 2 priests shield me in early dungeons and I just told them I don't generate rage under absorbs and they got it.
---
It gets worse here every day...
---
I've been trying to farm Felcloth and after a hot tip I went to those camps and found at least four hunters competing with me.
---
Just keep on questing. My Mage is 41 and my Warrior is 43 now, and they both had to suffer for the Warrior to get the tiger. Now only a weekend of good questing in STV and I'm already at some 70g combined. Mage gonna get the heap-of-bolts mount in no time! Questrewards really pick up their worth post-40s.
---
It kinda depends on resists, flow, and my effectiveness etc.
---
But it eanges from 25/h to 60/h. Usually watch movies/series while I do it, so it also depends on how interessting the movie/series is
---
Flurry axe  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=871/flurry-axe](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=871/flurry-axe)  Is apperently a really good weapon.

Im thinking its way better? But with the price for flurry on AH, and i see ppl really wants it, Im missing something Right??
---
There was a patch planned a "couple" weeks after release that was way before phase 2, and the keyring was to be in that patch.
---
Do you have trouble finding groups for dungeons?  If you do, I'd say go ahead and transfer.  If your play time will be more enjoyable if you transfer to a different server, then by all means do that.
---
&gt; aoe groups
---
&gt; solo questing with good route
---
&gt; normal dungeon farm
---
&gt; questing with a bad route
---
IT'S LIKE RA-IAAAAAAAAAIN
---
dont worry about him\^\^
---
hes just an american.
---
terrible at the game and as soon as they are shown their inadequacies they call everyone tryhards.
---
&gt;Everyone is different.
---
&gt;I come home from work, play for an hour, go for a work-out, cook, play some more. Run errands etc etc.
---
I am exactly the same,I work 40hours fulltime every week, live in my own house with my gf, plenty of daily errands to run. I also have a young daughter.
---
&gt;So for me and many other players, 1h queues are not manageable
---
They are more than manageable if you can be bothered to take the literal 2minutes it requires to set up remote login.
---
I was trying to make a group for sm armoury this morning on my healer priest. I had got in 2 warrior dps but the server was dead. I encouraged the warriors to start pulling small groups while we wait for other members, and then the one warrior seemed to gain confidence doing these pulls and then after a while offered to tank the rest of the instance as 2H "but I don't have a shield". It was all good (and in any case the meta is 2h tanking!)
---
"It's happening!" is also what I shouted when my girlfriend created her character. She didn't log back in after reaching level 2 because she doesn't want to get addicted.
---
Could be you are just a bad tank if you are getting so much grief.  I know it's difficult for tanks to grasp this as they tend to have a Messiah complex  but if you are constantly getting told you suck, well you just might suck.
---
Is tiny threat working now? It wasn't working for classic at launch
---
heh i know, hence the question.
---
i wanted to have herbs on track, and mining just casually whatever comes up on my way
---
My gear list says lead surveyor mantle drops in phase 5...
---
I have it.
---
IMO this addon is what caused the massive faction imbalances to begin with.
---
Yea, it's really annoying that despite the bug being acknowledged a month ago no fix has been issued. I'm hoping they fix this with the release of DM but it might just mean another week of no Songflower. GL with the post but I doubt it will gain much traction considering this subreddit's primary demographic.
---
It may be fun for you now, but not everything is solo-able no matter how much you want it to be
---
This goes for gear too then.
---
How come someone deserves a piece of gear more than anyone? It genuinely affects you 0 if someone reserves an item. You simply don‚Äôt join the group.
---
The good idea of reserving is that it keeps people away that are going to roll against you anyway so it‚Äôs a win win.
---
this is why pve servers are the best. inbalance doesn't matter
---
Imo DKP system is most fair for guild only runs. Helps prevent favoritism with loot council. That being said that‚Äôs guild only runs.
---
No dude. We had dual specs starting in WotLK and people still picked a spec they mostly played. A holy priest having the option to switch to shadow when they need to quest isn't "homogenizing", you aren't taking away the identity of either a shadow or a holy priest.
---
This desire to pick holes in anything is really the downfall of #nochanges. A few classes in the game are severely fucked by the lack of dual spec, the others aren't affected as much, it's a problem and it's hugely myopic to let it go as it is. At the very least, reducing the respec cost cap to 10g or something should be considered.
---
Had one being a total dick to me there yesterday, repeatedly. Skulldric, if you‚Äôre out there, I‚Äôll get my revenge one day. I‚Äôll never forget.
---
you should kick that rogue from the group, it makes it impossible to gain aggro when you're starting from 0 rage.
---
If you have to react to situations like that you can do blood rage (which generates some threat) and then battle shout. That makes the mobs come onto you instead of the rogue, which hopefully buys you enough time to get a sunder onto each of them.
---
I'd say their concern are legit since I absolutely didn't experience the same thing as op.
---
The only times the tank was flamed he was being an ass from what I've seen. I've actually noticed people are much more lenient on tank behaviour rather than dps.
---
Some guy was spamming herod trade chat with this like 4 weeks ago, spent all day telling trade chat it was an ultra rare pattern. Saw it on the AH like 3 days later by the same guy for 30~ gold.
---
Obv large pop servers have more rare drops and stuff, just don't convince yourself you're sitting on a goldmine. If you get a reasonable offer id take it.
---

I vote we call it Cookie's Cove. I know quite a few do on Deviate Delight.
---
ha found one of those this morning, and quit immediately
---
Quest and you‚Äôll have the gold in no time - and the xp/levels as a bonus seeing as your main goal is the money.
---
Don‚Äôt waste your time ‚Äòfarming‚Äô gold by killing mobs as it really isn‚Äôt that effective at 40
---
Ah someone else who read "The Dwarves" I guess? So nice to see the names and remember a good Story.
---
Not really. That's a false dichotomy sprinkled with a little gatekeeping.
---
I made a load of G by killing raptors in STV and skinning them. Dropped some greens too which helped.
---
I was in a gdkp that fell apart over bdw. The player that won the bid refused to pay and said give it to the next one down.  It looks like he was bidding up the pot and got caught. The raid leader wouldn't make him pay or leave so he may have been in on it.  The group broke up and cashed out.
---
That was the only bad experience I ever had with gdkp though. I wish ppl still did them. It seems like they've been replaced by selling runs.
---
Oh, I see. So basically you're sacrificng a bit of your own damage (because of the mana) for group damage.
---
I‚Äôd follow you into battle
---
Nah man DKP system will end up with a lot of bs and a lot of people mad. Free rolls this early or loot council is the only way.
---
I like the control of picking and chosing addons.
---
Thank you for your tips! Throwing one max Heal instead of two or three rank 1 Heals will help a lot, and that's probably my issue. I appreciate your help!
---
Yeah, I might. I really enjoy the dwarf-y atmosphere aswell.
---
I'd join that guild.
---
If you're new to the game, there's many good guides out there to help you get the hang of things.  Read up a bit, and you may find that you'll have an easier time of it.  Dying can be frustrating, and you have no AOE damage until you get blade fury.  Remember to be mindful of your pulls, and try to 1v1 targets when you can.
---
A Bigglesworth guild that hasn't even cleared Majordomo yet lol
---
◊û
---
Renew feels so good solo but yeah, doesn't seem like it's doing much in dungeons. I'll try to cut it. Thank you!
---
Use a slower weapon. Like someone else said you burn ammo way faster with fast weapons. You dont even use arcane shot at all, its just a waste of mana. Serpent sting is debatable, I havent used it in the last 40 levels.
---
Multishow is your best skill if you havent picked up aimed shot yet. Its a instant shot with additional damage.
---
Lost this last night to an out of guild off-tank who preceded to teabag me mercilessly after I died to Magmadar.   
---
Oooooooh the salt! The salt!
---
Don't get stuck on the example - there are lot of items, that really aren't an upgrade and being force to "buy" them with DKP to the detriment of other more useful items is a core issue of DKP. 
---
LC isn't perfect either and needs failsafes and transparency, but in my opinion it beats passing on updates for some other elusive reward.
---
Have you tried distract so they can't do the safe jump down to MC/BRD?? You could make them miss alot and die in lava loosing repairs before important times
---
Saxy
---
You are doing DKP pug ? Well, i can tell you that you are not going to raid, then. Because a random player in that system has absolutely ZERO chance of getting anything off that raid. Aka, he will join the numerous other pugs that have /random rolled MS +1 loot system.
---
At 60 I've been chain feared by a level 32. I respect it and let him get away.
---
I personally like this action bar:
---
1. Charge/intercept/taunt
---
2. Sunder armor on all 3 stances
---
3. Dunno
---
4. Dunno but had (rend) on battle stance...
---
5 Heroic strike on all stances
---
6. Hamstring on all stances
---
R (7). Execute.
---
How do you have it? any tips? Probably put whirlwind + MS on (2/3, or V)
---
Spell power all the way. Frost bolt gets 80% of all spell power added as damage and Fireball gets 100%.
---
Photo with my Phone, screencapped and screenshotet and uploaded. Haha im happy this is more confuse to people then a lvl 56 Moonkin with that staff
---
That was amazing, thanks for sharing! :D
---
What a bunch of whiners. Apparently this is what you get for being for being nice I guess.. I'm also on Horde - Razorgore and if I ever need an enchant I'll be sure to contact you instead of these guys.
---
You‚Äôre the only edge lord here.
---
But we are running in a more or less static group thus he is trusting me to keep him alive if situation arise and I‚Äôm trying not to overreact to his life tapping on the move between packs when no threat nearby. It‚Äôs light year differently in a static than in pug groups :)
---
Type /join lookingforgroup.
---
Also look into getting the add-on "classic lfg"

American

Doesn't show you the nodes that are *actually* present though.
---
/join LookingForGroup or local/UC chat
---
Wtf does VC stand for
---
Ha same! In Ashenvale?
---
TBC was a golden age for Druids, Tree form/Lifebloom was immense for PvE, Bears could actually tank as good as Warriors in some cases (Actually preferred for some fights!) Feral DPS was the most interesting rotation and actually did good damage, and Moonkin got actual good itemisation!
---
They were the premium PvP healer, slippery to catch and able to dispel drains, and still damn hard to kill when you pinned them down.
---
Druid/Warrior was the most common 2v2 team in TBC.
---
Isn't it quite obvious?
---
Hypnotic blade + offhand gives 14 int, 14 sprit and 9 spell damage which is obviously better than 15 int and 10 spirit?
---
The solution to that problem is quite easy tbh. The person who refused to pay was clearly just trying to bid up the pot, so he gets the boot and forfeits his share of the pot at the end. The item then goes up for auction again
---
Okay, I agree tanks are underappreciated but there are 3 rules when it comes to blame in Dungeon groups.
---
1.) If a tank dies, it's always the healers fault.
---
2.) If DPS pulls aggro, it's always the tank's fault.
---
3.) The DPS are always at fault for something too but I dunno what that is because I play DPS
---
This guy also bragged in a different thread about how he was 10k gold, as if using 40 accounts to acquire that is somehow an accomplishment.
---
You uninstalled the game but come here to complain and bitch every day. Why you such an angry little boy?
---
There are lots once u get towards lvl 55-58 but u goto look each one up individualy.
---
What server are you on? I could change that for you.
---
At least this bug got acknowledged. It is insane to me they deduced the cause but couldn't immediately fix it.
---
Meanwhile we got dozens of even more game-breaking bugs not even acknowledged by Blizzard:
---
Druids mana drainable in form.
---
Level penalties are not applying in PvP (i.e. level 30s can hit spells at &gt;90% rate on 60s).
---
Hunter FD,
---
Mount speed enchants/spurs are not applying multiplicatively (aka you're going much slower than you should),
---
Items just vanishing on creation (from professions) or vanishing when looted,
---
Vanish is completely busted,
---
Aggro in many forms (mobs not being linked, mobs not aggroing in certain circumstances, just peripheral aggro you get that you shouldn't be simply being near a player in a fight)...
---
Skull of Impending Doom is busted.
---
And on and on. All of this off the top of my head. I cannot imagine what dozens and dozens more are out there.
---
You can spellcleave in Sm Cath where you dont need your mount and continue collecting gold untill you can buy it.
---
Low skins most likely still won't make money, you'll vendor them until Thick I think.
---
All enchants currently seem to apply a hidden "buff" that counts to the buff limit of your character. So yes, even +stats on chest.
---
You literally only have to do it once too, just copy paste lol
---
Exactly why I don't respec Prot and when they ask me to tank as Arms I say I have no shield. People are just dumb and I don't have time for stupid.
---
if at all, then please good advise, not this. i will 100% aggro the skull as a wl if i just pump dmg. tank will taunt, i will get it back. its just not possible without a big gear or level gap (at least i havent had such a tank yet). that means the tank will run after the mob i got, ignoring the rest, leaving the healer/rest of the party to die. if he doesnt, healer will go oom or i will die (which happens most of the time, which is completly understandable. rather a dps dead than the group or even just the healer). 
---
its the simple things that kill runs. tanks that dont pull range mobs behind walls. tanks that ignore fleeing mobs, tanking them directly besides another pack that will inevitably be pulled. tanks that dont know how threat works. tanks that dont keep an eye on pats. tanks that dont mark.
---
at the same time, we can make the list for the others too!
---
dps that insta nuke. dps that jump around, pulling extra. dps that just pulls on purpose. dps that attack the wrong targets. dps that dont use a single cc (not even sheep, just a simple cs infight).
---
and, we can make that for healers too!
---
healers that prioritise wrong. healers that refuse to drink i they are above X%, even though they know that a mistake will cost more mana than they got. healers that dont heal some1 because they dont like him (why does no one heal lifetapping warlocks, i swear 95% of my bandadges are used in instances). healers that dont contribute to the party in any other way than healing (you can and you should use your whole kit, not just a downranked heal).
---
it was by far the easiest to think about tanks, they can make a million mistakes. dps dont have that many ways of fucking it up, its mostly just the same 2 things. healers were the hardest, i dont know many ways a healer can fuck up the run other than healing the wrong targets or not drinking if they need mana.
---
On a PvE server, no
---
On a PvP server the opposit faction should be your enemy.
---
It feels weird when I only have 50 free slots, blizz help me.
---
Time making post vs time googling easily found info vs chance of receiving useless bullshit from reddit morons. 
---
I‚Äôll stick to googling.
---
smooth criminal :)
---
When you ask a question on Reddit it‚Äôs almost the same thing as googling.  You‚Äôre getting the answer from a source outside of the game. 
---
Change my mind.
---
I played vanilla and never ever heard of it being called VC. It was DM on my server (Terenas EU)
---
no one is a dick for red is dead on a pvp realm. this clip was a pve realm, so no worries. If you seriously dont think someone killing someone on a pvp realm is okay for anything reason youre wrong.
---
Yeah, it's being downvoted because that's a pretty shitty troll, as well as an absurd claim.
---
Stories from pve servers about not pvping ?
---
I made this mistake way too many times in original WoW. Unless I know someone I'm not leaving my server, too many resources to utilize from my main.
---
He was until sometime between patch 3.3 and the release of Cataclysm. This can be ascertained by looking through the history of Wowpedia or WoWWiki.
---
I found this on one of the forum posts about the issue. Let us know if it works.
---
&gt;Go in your wtf folder , find the folder for your toon and wipe the layout-local.txt file
---
Thanks. Why uldaman is not farmed? I did not see streamers farming it. They only did sm then zf.
---
I‚Äôm just going to to type it out and copy and paste it when lfg
---
I wish they would add like 2 more pet slots in the stable.  It‚Äôs especially sad considering you need to constantly train new pets for skills, so you can basically only have 2 pets that you actually keep.
---
From the perspective of an arms warrior, the axe is better for two reasons:
---
1)Axe spec &gt; swords spec, due to synergy from critical strikes with deep wounds.
---
2)Faster weapon, and thus more rapid threat building for tanking.
---
You can ignore him. Do your stuff and leave
---
You can group up, climb up and kill him
---
You can report him.
---
But the best option always is to make a screenshot and put it on reddit.
---
yeah it's like you can life the life of your own spoiled child
---
Hi, /u/CUNT_CRUSADER22
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dhpesz/what_does_for_the_horde_translate_to_for_alliance/). 
---
Don't get me wrong, I made my realm choice based on census info.  However, if nobody knew what the faction balance was on any server, we would have a lot fewer 90/10 servers.  While there would still be imbalances, they wouldn't be so extreme.
---
Why is that lol? Lots of guilds aren't rushing progress. A lot of people new to vanilla want to go slow, or have to because we're all adults now.
---
pssssssss! OKW ordered all troops to remain calm until the big day! :P
---
Depends on what you aim for. I have 60 mage and 60 priset and now lvling a warrior. The priest was my first character and I was just going for two gathering professions like skinning and herbalism.
---
If you aim to maximize and race to 60 just skip any professions cause it gives a lot of downtime. You can get skinning if you want and basically sell/vendor all the mats since its about the same price as AH anyway. Only the endgame skinning is worth putting on AH.
---
At lvl 60 you want tailoring and engineering.
---
Tailoring for crafting your Truefaith vestment (recipe BOE but the craft is BOP), and thereafter you can dump it or just keep it since you can do Mooncloth every 4 days (need 250 in tailoring) and on my server its free +20g.
---
I farmed a little over 30 devilsaur leathers in 2 hours the other day. Sure, a lot of people know about it, but it's not guaranteed that there are always players there.
---
Wot m8
---
Just wait until phase 2 lol
---
Myth of soma ganking flashlights
---
Yes. Spells in pvp work different
---
The second statement is literally My point of this pst. That googling anything about this game will bring up web pages from 2006-2011 on the front page. 7-8 year old information on the internet is useless. 
---
I‚Äôd rather make a reddit post and gather multiple recent resources than go back in time 9 years and decipher information that could have been wrong or not the most efficient at the time
---
But why
---
Yeah... seems almost an alliance mafia at this point. I got up early and they were over camped. EPL too.
---
I'm going to get the Stam and HS bonuses from Demonology then throw a few points in Imp CoEx and COA most likely. Maybe grab a few Destro before respeccing.
---
That is a horrible example.  Everyone can use the mount, not everyone can use all gear.   No one group member is more deserving of this mount than any other.  It‚Äôs purely a cosmetic item completely separate from class, race, gear, and spec.  
---
Reserves in general are stupid and selfish.  At that point, it‚Äôs not a fair, even, helpful group.  It‚Äôs a Christmas shopping carry for one selfish person.
---
Just end the search in "vanilla" and 99,6% of the time the first one is the right one. Works for me
---
But people are elitist and entitled and feel like your unworthy reddit post riddles their wowclassic feed
---
When tBC is announced I will need to future proof my guild by prohibiting Blood elfs. 
---
Or switch to alliance in order to kill those basic bitches and thristy boys. Then again on alliance I would be forced to cooperate with humans
---
Yea, you're only getting names out of it. No spell IDs, no ranks, nothing. So addons have to map the names to their IDs/cast times.
---
Thanks, makes sense I guess that you wouldn't have the Energy/CP to go straight into a full kidney. So something like this instead then?
---

Feels like using the last point in Dirty Deeds would be better than 3% stealth and 1 sec CD.
---
Vanish not working :(
---
I never new that was possible hahaha, he must have been so confused after.
---
bears dont get AP from agi, though, right? its just crit/dodge/armor, so that would change that math a bit, but not the conclusion.
---
what i got from the second paragraph is that .05 crit = .05 dps, so 1 crit = 1 dps.
---
with that math in mind:
---
cloudrunner: 14 str = 2 dps + 15 agi = .75 dps = 2.75 dps
---
vs
---
gaijin 9 str = 1.3 dps + 1 crit = 1dps = 2.3 dps.
---
good to know!
---
Just so you know, the DPS increase you get by upgrading from Thrash + Mirah's to Rend Set is quite small. I'd suggest focusing on raiding MC and Ony, they drop actual upgrades (Brutality Blade &amp; Vis'kag).
---
You can check yourself by looking at Shadowpanther and ClassicSim.
---
Also the levels should give an indication of what they mean. A level 58 is clearly looking for 2 more to give a tribute to the most iconic dungeons.. deadmines.
---
I completely agree, I‚Äôm just pointing out in this thread that googles algorithm isn‚Äôt up to par that vanilla classic is relevant again. That‚Äôs all.
---
I start all my searches with "wow classic" and I haven't had to look past the first 3 links. Just Google it better.
---
Maybe they enjoy it?
---
Bully for you.
---
Yeah it's a mess but it's all we have.
---
I did STV for a weekend. Had some fun.
---
But after that I went back to dungeon farming like the dirty magetard I'm.
---
Didnt know, Just send via WhatsApp to an friend and told me to tell that story here, thats IT lol
---
VC
---
Gotcha
---
Exactly. I didn't even know Deadmines existed until I was 2 years into the game.
---
Nah my gold came from being the only lionheart helm crafter on the server
---
"Free Pandaria from it's panda supressors" then? No? Too bad.... :D
---
Thanks, friend. I'm glad my very important opinion could brighten your day.
---
It was VC on my old server and people use mixed DM or VC on my Classic server. When Dire Maul drops, it will become VC again I am sure. Why? Because who wants to type a 3rd letter or ask questions?  At least VC makes sense in that it reflects the dungeon boss's name. How many bosses are in Dire Maul?  You want to make up sub-designations for each of them?
---
I don't know  why people are trenchant about Deadmines not being VC, why does it bothet you?
---
xD
---
No, don't do that. You're in the wrong.  
---
They organised the raid, and they didn't want to carry it on at the same time as you did. That's... Totally fine. If you just tried to organise another PuG on a day they couldn't raid, they were in the right to hold the instance hostage. Doing the same to them is just reinforcing your own assholery.
---
This is why wowhead exists...
---
If you say so!
---
Its called scalping and you're an unethical individual. Eat shit and stay banned.
---
It's better to stay on the same realm, just because you can have your main help out (a good example is buying bags).
---
I love you so much doubleshine ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I love you both
---
There is someone farming felcloth 24/7
---
I finish a night shift at work think ill play wow for a couple of hours to wind down and just end up spending more gold on agility pots dying to fucking priests and warlocks. Rogue life is tough
---
Wanna know how I know you're not 60?
---
Of course nobody is flaming tanks in rfc
---
How many hours do you farm per day?
---
Shards dont even exist yet
---
Again, i took the screenshot before the roleplay.
---
This ain't 'Nam Smokey, there are rules! Mark it zero! :P
---
Goddammit.. now I have to farm Runecloth and get a Wolf...
---
I joined a PVP server because a few people I know all wanted to be on the same one, I used to play PVE back when WOW first came out and I'm honestly thinking about just rolling a new character in an RP or PVE server just to get away from the endless stream of assholes having their fun by ganking way lower level players. 
---
I've not had one straight up fair fight so far, it's always some max level jerk or a gang of mid level jerks just wandering around trying to cause maximum inconvenience to everyone around them. I only have maybe an hour or two a day max to play, and it's killing my desire to continue.
---
Just a quick fyi westfall is actually closer than the duskwood FP.
---
It is running off the BfA client.  Have you ever had issues with that client?
---
Thanks :]
---
Clearly a guild based in the context of the picture lol
---
Come on, it's alliance we're talking about. Smart isn't usually a part of the equation.
---
Only one real choice there.
---
BoE-epic-needing is still scum of the earth
---
It doesn't matrer if skull aggros on you. That's the point! If everyone focuses skull it dies long before it even gets to you
---
&gt; You'd have to constantly be switching between the two, which would be totally impractical.
---
i have a macro that switches between herbs/ores bound to the tilde key. very practical to spam it along with tab looking for stealthy targets.
---
Why is 7 year old information useless for a 15 year old game?
---
Noted. ‚ÄúGoogle it more better‚Äù
---
/S
---
Theres 3 legash encampments
---
Literally unplayable.
---
Yeeeahh.. I thought about this one. It's a PVP server-- because I wanted her on the same server as my main, and because for the most part we will really only be leveling together. But I do know the day is coming that she will be attacked and killed... and then scream WTF
---
Since there is no game support for a guild bank, what are my best options to set one up in classic?
---
I don't get what I'm supposed to be looking for? Just a bunch of people shit talking after it happened.
---
What are the dungeons that doesn't require a key?   
---
I'm rogue but I started playing WoW in Legion so I was not around during Vanilla.  
---
I know I can pick the locks inside BRD but I wasn't able to access the side entrance to Strat without a key for example.
---
It‚Äôs a good thing you‚Äôre so wise. I would have never figured out what was going on without you!
---
Too hard to hit shift from that position.
---
the crazy thing is that for about 18 months back in vanilla, if you switched back and forth between herbs and ores a couple times, they would both magically stay lit up on the minimap.
---
Ahh do they have a live support/forum that replies as quick as you did in 2 minutes to my thread? I enjoy verbal feedback and different points of view, not just a block of text.
---
Did you know that the people of Lordaeran died and became the forsaken?!??!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!
---
And you don't clearly know better, or the plight of the Lordaeron citizen would have been heard. 
---
Gutterspeak cackles will see you in Stranglethorn.
---
Will do (Oreg)
---
Yeah dude, I edited the OP. The fix for me was directly related to my ISP though (Aussie Broadband), so I don't know how helpful it will be :(
---
I heard them bears got roots.
---
Classic wowhead shows those as the correct levels
---
 ZF is can have some really spiky damage.  I was a dps shaman at that point, and when I ran I had to constantly help the priest healer, who I had no reason to believe was bad.  I think that particular tank didn't understand that he actually had to at least pretend to wear tank gear if he wanted to tank.  Most of the problem was his fault.  
---
Uldaman can go downhill quickly.  There's corners, and runners, and problems with the z-index.  It can quickly deescalate to a point where even a good healer can't save it.  
---
In general this is the mentality I see in bad players honestly.  Instead of evaluating the problem, they just assume it's someone else's fault.  I know I'm a good healer.  When I get a good tank, which I tend to only find in guild runs, the runs are very easy.  There are a lot of people who pretend to tank that I can't even keep alive though.  At one point I ran a live strat where I had more hp as the healer than the tank.
---
Woah thats crazy.
---
Ah you're right
---
Yes, and it might even upset others that you might be able to find fun things in the game to to do others than grind best in slot items or raid.
---
You're right, I glanced over that part. Bear form only gets Dodge, Crit and Armor from Agi, feral gets AP in addition.
---
Luffa, nifty stopwatch, skull of doom , slumber sand, flash bombs , linkens boomeramg just to name a few
---
dire maul... whats the point everyone already has all their BiS til BWL  :| except the 10 feral tanks on each server
---
I've found mages to be the new hunters as far as stereotypes go
---
Not a complete list as far as I know, but this came from this sub..
---
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TpZA5byhhbVcaNr_USzUQsBnWg4vFHbIYtDn83HK9rM/edit
---
What level are you?
---
Also what do you mean by emergencies? Pulling more mobs than the tank can usually handle? The tank about to die? The DPS about to die?
---
I‚Äôll recommend you always have mana potions on you, and try and ensure you start every pull with at least 75% mana. If you‚Äôre not then don‚Äôt be afraid to drink before a pull and wait until you‚Äôre topped up, it‚Äôll usually be a good 10 or so seconds before the tank is below 50% anyway (assuming they‚Äôre level and geared appropriately). 
---
Also get used to cancel casting. For example if you‚Äôre about to drop a big heal on the tank but the mob is almost dead anyway then you‚Äôre better off cancelling it and just dropping a renew instead.
---
I'm starting to develop PTSD everytime my health reaches 50%
---
*Mozambique noises*
---
How much dps do you actually do though (before crits)? Because that changes the crit to dps conversion
---
With 200 dps 1% crit would be 2 DPS
---
That's bot a bug. Exactly why we need screenshots.
---
Itemization and Class design are very much intertwined but you are very much right.
---
&gt; Raids require a significantly smaller percentage of tanks than 5man dungeons do.
---
Kind of but realistically at least guilds that plan for all phases will be aiming to have 8 tanks geared (per raid), which is 1 tank per 5 people = same as dungeons.
---
Start running GY at lvl 30, and spend the entirety of your 30-40 experience farming SM as best as you can. 
---
Run GY in the hopes you get ironspines eye, and the ebon vise gloves, those are improvements.
---
Otherwise it‚Äôs xp farm until library opens at lvl 32. 
---
Then farm lib until armory opens at lvl 35,  then farm armory to either 40, or until you get the tabard. 
---
If you get the tabard from armory just do cath runs for Xp until lvl 40.
---
Don‚Äôt go back to anything below cathedral until you get quest to get your sword. Then do that quest chain, then go back to farming SM. 
---
You get decent gold, and you get lockboxes from pickpocket and in turn more gold.   
---
Once you reach lvl 40 go get your RFD quest, then run RFD to get your Vanq Sword.  Now you‚Äôre set until thrash blade
---
If you spent your time in SM and didn‚Äôt waste gold you‚Äôll have enough for a mount at 40- 41 at the latest
---
Spend your 40‚Äôs grinding levels in badlands/ Tanaris....so essentially run Uldaman and Zul‚ÄôFarrak (the dungeons in those 2 zones), until 45 when you can run maurudon for thrash blade.
---
&gt; Is it neccessary to have a MT with 315 FR?
---
yes.
---
I‚Äôm on the fence on this because yes google does answer most questions.... but usually I get on and ask because google answer is actually wrong...it‚Äôs happened on a couple occasions where I would google search for a solid 20 mins getting the same answers, than finally ask on here and get the right answer. Leveling guides/class guides can be and often are wrong in very small ways but big enough to waste considerable time or effort... there are some absolutely unnecessary posts asking the most simple of questions, which I feel those can be answered in game if you ask
---
I can find all my answers i have for this game on google.  
---
i just dont understand how people are not able to use google.  
---
from my perspective its just laziness to ask it here...
---
What, you mad at our superior racial and hard to target frame?
---
Have you watched old YouTube videos on the best guilds in time during that era? If not go watch and see if you would do anything they did then. You wouldn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs embarrassing. The best guild players back then are your casuals today. People are doing MC pre 60 and you want me to trust information back then when everyone complained you neeed fire resist and all that shit.
---
Man Im 60 and I couldn't even tell you what any pets but my imp are called.
---
Noktip. He's not very special and his phase breaks constantly.
---
Yeah I'd considered doing something like that but for me at least I'd consider that impractical. If you're happy to spam thag while running around though then glhf man :)
---
Yeah, you're right. OC calls OP an awful tank just for posting here but I'm the edgelord for calling him out. My bad. /s
---
Maybe at early levels, in the long run combat swords will be much quicker for levelling
---
High pop pvp servers suck ass.  Moved to a medium pop pvp server and it's been a blast. O still gank, and still get ganked but the game is actually playable in certain zones like st and honestly much closer to what I remember in vanilla rather than the constant Zerg you see on high pop servers.
---
Can you link this macro? Im gunna drop Alchemy soon for Mining.
---
Yeh i think we will go faster through the content as well all know the content so hopefully they wont prolong the releases of phases so people dont leave. But yeh the demand for the game is high enough for them to care for it. 
---
Also unless classic plus would introduce some kind of love for the hybrid specs to not only be healers etc i wont be a big fan of it.
---
I assume you use Elv UI. Honestly, I've played since 2005 and I still prefer the original action bar interface. I know that it can be limiting but if I'm fine with it then I know she will be. A UI addon like Elv UI can be super overwhelming right now so I do not want to push that on her.
---
True true, the one to the south west is out of my farm route so I never touch it
---
Lmao. Git gud.
---
Engineering is a hard counter to all casters.
---
I don‚Äôt remember any of these bosses being ‚Äò??‚Äô 
---
But then again my memory might be a little fuzzy on that.
---
Van Cleef (last boss in instance)
---
Healers don't care if a dps is taking damage.  It's gonna happen.  They care when there's too much damage to remain mana positive, or damage that is unpredictable.  If a dps takes some damage that's fine.  If a dps takes some damage, and the tank stops doing his job, that's the last time I run with that tank.
---
Its been proccing off of everything, psychic scream, vamp embrace, mindlfay even mind smoothe, and i can assume probably holy nova too?
---
Unfortunately no, but it is a lot less cancer than reading 50 different responses on reddit. Plus all the data should be up to date
---
it happened to me 3 times in the last 30 minutes.
---
BRM is camped by horde at least 80% of the time... and then in the rare times when allies have the majority, OF COURSE we are mad and will strike back whenever we can. It's really annoying that you need 3-5 corpse runs just to get to the dungeon, even on a stealth class.
---
Imagine thinking age causes this to happen.
---
It was 70.
---
The reason is that 20% of dungeon groups is tanks (1 in 5-mans, MT and OT in UBRS), while 5% of 40-man raid is tanks since most encounters need 2, rarely 4 are needed. Even 4 tanks/raid would mean half of the demand for tanks compared to 5-mans.
---
I can only think of one encounter that requires 20% of raid as tanks, and that is 4 horsemen in naxx, which pretty much caused the best raiding guild for each server and faction to poach tanks from every other raiding guild when they progressed up to 4hm.
---
Nah, BC and WotLK had the same threat problems in them from DPS. Hell prolly Cata did too I just quit after WotLK. Remember the days where you pulled with misdirect and still TPS spammed your ass off or you'd lose aggro 99/100 times
---
Do you use proprietary or open source drivers for GPU?
---
This post is how I know you don't play tank
---
EverQuest penalties were pretty brutal as well. When the game first launched you had 24 hours of in-game time or 7 days of logged out time to retrieve your corpse or all your items rotted. You also lost a healthy chunk of exp and could lose levels.
---
You could /consent someone to loot all your items if you were having difficulty retrieving your body IIRC. It was changed soon after that consent would just allow your corpse to be dragged inside the zone.
---
As a ret pally, warriors are going to be my staple diet when it comes to farming honour... We are shockingly overpowered against them at lower levels.
---
Yojambros unite ‚úä‚úä
---
All you need to do is write "\[item/quest\] wowhead" and click your first link, there you have a comments from as far as 2005 to carry your lazy ass because you can't be bothered to read a quest text.  
---
That's some insane level of entiltement, if you dont know why you can always google it.
---
if you play as boomkin in a duo leveling group- are you gonna have a bad time lol
---
Her multi attack melee isn't a bug
---
Literally. How and why wasnt there a raid in karazhan  with a questline to do some stuff with what medivh left or with the man himself in order to reopen the dark portal ourselves I dont know.
---
So tough.
---
You gotta do more then runs.  I saw Cyclopean Band drop once out of like 50 runs.
---
True but on the other hand I like them epic world pvp battles just very one sided now on my server
---
Free action potion
---
And so because you haven't seen tanks being flamed yet that means it never happens?
---
If you go back to the other post and read it, especially the examples of what he did, I think you'll agree that he didn't do anything that indicates he's a bad tank.
---
Tanking isn't inherently hard either, in a way that someone wouldn't be able to do it. I mean you just have a different rotation/priority of targets. Your group can very much make it hard though. I've had few groups so far where it literally seemed like people were intentionally focusing my lowest threat target at all times. No shit I'm gonna run out of taunts and rage. I consider myself lucky that I haven't had many bad groups yet. But boy, they're out there.
---
Oh greeeeeat my servers famous =/
---
So that's why they fall over so fast. xD
---
One of the raid members comment that Emberseer died like a trash mob.
---
I really want to see video of you taking any class 5+ levels higher than you. Not even trying to be snarky. I want to see this content and learn how you do it cause it sounds impossible to me.
---
Asuch as I agree that yanking low levels is a sign of a sad individual, I've never understood complaining about it, if you roll on a PvP server then it's an expected thing. You will land into a flightpoint with an entire enemy raid waiting on you to land, you will get handled by 60s in full raid gear at level 1, you will get that elite down solo to 5% health and then get stabbed in the back, you will afk in your capital city and come back dead, it's part of the experience. If not your thing then roll pve.
---
Yes it's also where you gather for the buffs pre raid. We'll, when zg hits anyway.
---
Not really I can migrate.....
---
&gt;Can confirm , someone killed me while I was leveling in Tanaris when i was doing the Tooga Esort quest right  near the end  
---
&gt;You better believe i made 3 alliance suffer the same fate!  
---
&gt;for the horde mother fuckers
---
Ganking people lower level than you doing an escort quest is the lowest of the low.
---
Had this happen in Searing Gorge. For some reason, after getting to the high 40s - low 50s, all the horde priests start being annoying. Maybe they get corrupted by using Shadow Form =)
---
Undead priests are attack on sight now. A majority of them seem to be out for mischief, and it is just safer to attack first.
---
Meanwhile, the 3% hit scope from MC is supposed to drop in phase 1, but it isn't dropping.
---
While I dislike it, open world pvp is ALWAYS this way in ANY PvP game.
---
You do not WANT a fair fight in open world pvp.
---
Fair Fights are for arenas, battlegrounds, or games with referees.
---
Just like in the real world, if you find yourself in a fair fight, run, though in WoW it doesnt matter because death is so cheap.
---
TLDR: If you play on a WoW PvP server, you will get ganked by people higher level than you.
---
He did the thing
---
Layering has been cut down to 1 or 2 layers depending on how populated your server is.
---
Alexsensual did the same thing when he hit 60. He hit 60 less than a week after release, and immediately went to redridge and just ganked for HOURS. Also corpse camped the bodies so they couldn't quest or anything.
---
We can't all be super no lifers at 13 and thank God for that.
---
Not going to happen lol. The amount of work they would have to do redesigning Outland to work without flying mounts basically prohibits it.
---
I think if they're going to put more than the bare minimum effort in after Naxx, it'll be for entirely new content rather than tweaking pre-existing expansions like that.
---
Is bigglesworth short of players on your server? I dont see a reason to merge guilds unless a server is dead af.

The problem is there is no definitive answer, the training points for your pet are dependent on what you want them to specialise in. For example, in most raids you are better off with a tankie pet if you are playing BM. If you are playing MM, then wolf. Then your pets need to trained accordingly. If you are doing MC you want health + fire resistance so that the pet doesn't die in every AoE (also why tankie pets can be better). Armour is better for solo play against beasts, but health is better against humanoids (because they often have spells). There's not really a specific pet build that is optimal above all others for all content. The only exception to this would be an average pet, such a boar, with evenly spread out points.
---
Pet stealth level always remains at the same level. The added levels only effect damage + speed.
---
Truefaith is the best until T2 robes, which won't come until you got nefarian on farm. You decide if it's worth the 400g.

How about we have DM, VC, DM:EWN all coexist instead of this fuck wit 'don't mess with my nomenclature' going on..

Worst mob in the game. Absolute turds

15" version to be exact!
---
man, I'm currently running a setup of an i7-4790k + GTX 1080 and am very happy with it. Currently thinking about switching to a phat laptop to have the same performance, but be portable again, too.
---
The Y740-15 would be the perfect laptop for me, especially as I love Lenovo laptops. On the other hand it would have the *exact* performance of my current setup and such an investment (about 2000‚Ç¨) should yield a bit more, as I want to rock this then for at least 3 years.
---
Sorry to pour my heart out with this misery, I just wanted to tell this. And also tell those "get her a setup" guys that adding a mouse to this good laptop would be enough to sit at a table with :D
---
And I'm so envious of your wife. I'd love to experience the WoW experience without knowing anything about it once again!
---
During a war where there was nothing to win but fame and glory, people died over and over wasting millions of gold on supplies.
---
I once did the math on the cost of a war. If they would have sold the gold on 3th party websited they would have 2000 euro.
---
It was wasted in 2 hours. But it was glorious.
---
Always like 3 or 4 others doing laps when I head there.
---
Didn't think about that but you're totally right ! I should have take of picture of my face when I saw that. I could already see myself buying the mount at the very moment I was reaching level 40
---
This is a good tip. I quest most days in from 6am to 7am before work on a pvp server. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been ganked in the morning. It seems like everyone is just going about their business and isn‚Äôt interested in picking fights. Saturday afternoon in STV is a different story though...
---
Not his brother... but the alternative would be to skill fury and farm solo, or reroll a mage, that would be one less tank and tanks are already short.
---
And yes, money does everything in this game. I blew several gold in explosives each run, and I'm desperatly trying to save up gold for a force reactive disk (tho this seems to be impossible atm, due to arcanite bar prices skyrocketing)  - I can't farm as a tank, so I need to do dungeons for the gold to buy better equip to be a better tank. I run dungeons I don't need any loot from gladly for friends and guildies, but for randoms? You better bring me a offer that is more lucrative than to twink up a mage and start solo farming
---
No need to worry about resistances till level 60.
---
Just make sure you have claw and growl. I tend to learn new levels of abilities every 20 levels or so. At around 40 you can go get dash and bite. All this is considering you grind with a cat. You can train the armor and stamina buff abilities to make your pet last longer.
---
I work full time and have a 56 warrior, 47 hunter, 25 mage and a 24 warlock.
---
I know this feel.
---
Yeah it is. I have one of those laptop fan coolers that you put your laptop on top of and it cools it. But she didn't wanna use that. I figured it would only be a short stint that she used it like this so I said it was fine for now. By the time she got to level 4-ish, she said the bottom of the laptop was So hot. I told her it's a gaming laptop that is playing on its highest performance level, it's not plugged in (dies in about an hour and half of play), and she had it on top of a pillow. She understand and moved up to my desktop when my laptop was at 20% battery life and the screen dimmed and lowered to Balanced power usage.
---
It also introduced almost every aspect of what people say is the death of wow today.
---
Free action potions, engineering trinketst/grenades, tidal charm, nifty stopwatch, restorative potion. Have you tried all of these obtainable things yet? If not stop complaining about how they are unbeatable
---
Yeah that was what everyone wanted and the leader refused. No one was willing to continue after that shit.
---
Not at all.... all that old information is factually correct when it comes to hard coded content and the bit that isn‚Äôt is easily found . 
---
What your dumbass is apparently looking for is theorycrafting adjustments just for classic, because apparently you need a guide with pictures and hand holding just to function. 
---
Then to ice the damn cake you expect detailed info from a discussion forum when there are 10k word articles everywhere with all data updated for classic. 
---
You are just being a whinny bitch who doesn‚Äôt want to be told how much of a goof you are being.
---
Guilds like this rely on having an abundance of players to form raid groups/dungeon groups. They live and die based off having enough people to fuel their ranks, since there's virtually no community when you have that many people. They need to just keep recruiting and absorbing other guilds to keep their guild breathing.
---
Nah, every single PVP server is horde advantage according to every census done. PVE and RP are Alliance favored. If you're getting camped as a horde you are way behind the swarm, or play at odd hours.
---
Free zepplins so adventurers travel the world faster, spend more time killing mob  instead of running across the continent, loot more valuable item, sell more merchandises at the AH and thus more auction fee for the Goblins
---
If you play and have fun, you're not gonna have a bad time.
---
Balance druids are far from perfect, and have a few glaring issues, but if you have fun then go nuts.
---
I mean if some fan websites / private servers can dig out accurate stats from every patch, so can blizzard. It's just easier that way :)
---
You can actually see him dying in the first 2s of the clip, watch the unitframes
---
I‚Äôve never seen a queue on the server. It is pretty empty during down times, but you can still find a group for some minimally run dungeons. I believe Alliance has slightly more players than Horde, but not by much. High level ganking lowbies is alive and well, especially in STV. The only thing I‚Äôve run into is I haven‚Äôt seen a super active guild yet, but I think that‚Äôs my perspective. I‚Äôm sure there is.
---
I'm looking for a image that shows all the information about the Warrior. Like at certain levels you should be using this sequence of abilities, weapon progress and other stuff. I was just one large image, I've seen it floating around on this subreddit but I've lost it.
---
Yes Officer, this comment right here.
---
Animated Chain Necklace from Ramstein. 30 runs, saw one drop and lost the roll.
---
Personal preference I think I used to toss a renew on the backend of a heal that topped off my tank so I could wait longer before having to heal again for max mana regen.  Not sure if that helps it from a mana inefficiency standpoint.
---
Before the 486, I had an Amiga 500, and before that a Commodore 64.   I think I will always win.
---
Right, let me rephrase, the quest and the actual thunderfury was added in 1.6.
---
Any guild that got a binding or both prior to 1.6 had no use for them. My bad.
---
Yeah, because who doesn't like messed-up talent trees with tons of necessary talents gated behind pointless prerequisites. 
---
Worse talents would also change next to nothing on the current raiding situation. It's not items or talents that changed the game, it's the players. People now play on decent hardware that can deal with 40 players casting stuff and boss adds running around, and with a fiber connection instead of dial up with 200ms ping. 90% of the player base plays with a proper spec and actual BiS gear instead of picking stuff that looked cool, or was part of a class set so it had to be good.
---
I'll defend sword spec over axe spec til the day I die. Extra attacks are basically super-crit, since they themselves can also crit, and you should have plenty of crit anyway to keep Deep Wounds running.
---
Aye, this is true. I think it also had to do with the rest of the code base too, and something to do with what they felt was the best place to start for the "true essence of Vanilla", or some shit like that.
---
The video shows them doing this, yes. Not to take anything from them, of course, they're clearly fantastic.

Hmm might be a european thing to call it DM then, not sure. Any 'mericans can confirm they call it VC too and EU-ers who call it DM?
---
I have limited time to play and already leagues behind my friends and guildies (not 60 yet). If I‚Äôm out questing and someone asks for food or water I ask for a reasonable fee. Usually 50% of what they would get that level water for at an innkeeper. Maybe I‚Äôm an asshole but stopping to conjure and drink and conjure and evo and conjure some more so someone can have a few stacks of water is time consuming and if you forgot to get it at the inn, I shouldn‚Äôt have to pay for that mistake with my time.
---
In original vanilla, there were tons of players that never raided, or only went to one or 2 raids before Burning Crusade came out.
---
Raids got way more popular in Burning Crusade, and then became almost mandatory in Lich King.
---
You will be at a disadvantage in PvP to hard core raiders,  however if it's not worth the effort to you, don't worry about it. plenty of casuals for everyone to eat.
---
You can hear out in pre raid dungeons avoiding the raids and in phase one gold farm and random open world pvp (no rewards) phase 2 and 3 are what I‚Äôm looking forward to! He real pvp starts
---
Your thumb is on spacebar normally I'd assume. The rest of the keybinds are "Upshifted" a row on the keyboard. Thumb would be the logical one to hit C.
---
Same with Ironaya.
---
Well [Robes of the Exalted](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13346)  from Baron in Strat UD is good enough. Those two robes will last until phase 4 so depends on how much gold you have over.
---
I don't even have it on my priest yet since I main my mage (archmage chest for him + epic mount). 
---
If you gonna aim for SP PVP then you can save gold and skip it and just use Robes of the Exalted for healing in raids since a raid group will basically only have 1 SP. Engineering and skinning then?
---
Yeah worst that happens is some 30 minutes of corpse camping.
---
I bought this for 20g on Fairbanks a few weeks ago. As others have said its prob not server first. Grats regardless!
---
If you‚Äôre AOE farming illusionary rod is better bc blizzard doesn‚Äôt benefit from speller and you want items with high Int for a bigger mana pool. If you‚Äôre playing more single target hypnotic blade is better as spellpower &gt; every other stat.
---
Sko-lo-mance
---
Lowbies are usually 45+ won‚Äôt get 1shot so they can get decently close. They have to go into the instance with the Hunter and they‚Äôll be eligible for the loot.

What you guys think I can charge for this thing? On my seemingly casual pve server there're literally 0 on the market at the moment. Is AH even the right place to sell this? I've read numbers from 100g to 250g and that's a pretty wide range imo, should I just start with 175g and see where it goes?
---
Everyone said classic wouldn‚Äôt happen either :)
---
Asking people on Reddit is not a "resource", you're just getting a bunch of anonymous people on the internet to find links for you.
---
It's still 9% (or 6% if you're a human using swords/maces, or orc using axes).
---
The bug is that your offhand swings use the yellow hitcap (9% or 6% with wep skill) while Heroic Strike is queued. Just queue HS and cancel it before your MH swings and you'll miss practically no offhand swings.
---
didn't they plan on making bgs cross realm?
---
Wait, can you access this normally? Like could you walk in that corner and just fall down like that without being feared?
---
I'm suprised nobody mentions the obvious mismatch in role distribution between raids and dungeons when this is discussed. In dungeons, 20% of the groups are tanks while in raids it's more like 5-10%. There will always be a lack of tanks in dungeons because of this reason alone.
---
Vanillia wow introduce wow that became retail wow so we should just end it...
---
The flying in tbc was great. The flying in Azeroth from cata was the problem. 
---
People who enjoy pvp loved arena and love gear. Casual raiders no longer got free pvp power from easy raids.
---
More viable specs and classes meant more overall fun from the community.
---
Plus some of the best raids and art in the game. No one hated tbc until retail ruined wow and suddenly elitist act like they didbt like anything but vanillia
---
Another reason why I wanted her to play with me on PVP. I want to see if she can deal with it because 1) she will be playing me.. so at pretty much any point, she gets attacked... I mean she will have me to help out if it's not someone 10+ levels higher.
---
She's a warlock, so if I can teach her to respond with just a Fear and then a couple dots... she should be fine. But, i agree, no one should assume that women can't handle it. There are plenty of women in pvp servers. But i think people assume PVP servers to be more for advance players. I know when I First started playing, I played in PVE and then later discovered what PVP was... ultimately being a whole lot harder.
---
If you're on Whitemane and familiar with a guild called SMorc on the horde side... then you will understand she is in a world of pain for her future though... (SMorc is a Horde guild whose single intention is to make Alliance's life as miserable as possible).
---
Top tip? Minimize travel times. Typically each quest gives xp worth of only ten even leveled kills. If you need to spend more time running than what it would take to kill 10 monsters, then it's not efficient. Leveling guides and addons have pretty good paths figured out to minimize this but common sense goes a long way, do not run anywhere just to return one delivery quest or pick up a troll tablet. Stack quests as you can or use one of the addons.
---
Class wise it depends on what you play but generally you want to kill mob few levels below you to maximize resource to xp ratio. For casters this means utilizing wands, for melee trolls blood potion is a good investment. Also plan ahead what weapons to get. Some quest rewards are overrated (like Trash Blade). It's awesome of course but unless you get lucky and quickly find a good group to do whatever dungeon is needed, you're better of using soloable Q rewards (which you can plan ahead) or in the worst case invest some money to buy a catchup weapon from AH.
---
Skip professions, they're not necessary even for lvl 40 mount. They help but at a cost of time and efficiency, time spent skinning/mining/herbing is time you could've spent killing your next mob and it stacks up pretty fast. Careful management of what skills you buy during leveling from the trainer will get you enough money to buy that mount.
---
If you can, farming dungeons is very efficient. Downside is that finding a group can be a hassle, this also puts you at the mercy of other people. Risky but can pay off. Streamers did this because they had ready comps, unless you have that luxury, do not spend 2 hours looking for spellcleave group. The mage might suck, the tank might suck, the healer might disagree that he/she doesn't want to do the spellcleave, drama may ensue and then the group breaks up after two pulls and you just wasted one level worth of time making that group etc.
---
Do not do escorts on pvp realms. Hell, do not quest on pvp realms, just find a small spot somewhere far away and farm those boars. If you see a friendly being ganked, help them out and move on. Running past them just makes the rogue come after you next and that friendly you abandoned won't help you because you didn't help him. Assert dominance but don't waste time on extended skirmishes. This is somewhat crucial mistake people make, they run past their friendlies thinking it saves time, but in the end that just makes the enemy faction more bold in their ganking because you're not putting up a fight. Ganking is not about being top-dog pvp'er, it's about wasting your time. You might feel like you need to get revenge but that's when you lose time. Focus on the mission.
---
Early STV is not that bad, shit hits the fan in the southern parts usually. Nesignwary quests are all over the place that you can usually avoid ganks. If you can see Blackrock Mountain, you're doing it wrong, do not quest there unless you're a rogue/druid or have a group to defend yourself.
---
The item lost in tibia was there for everyone to loot. Goldfarming went from monster farming to people farming.
---
I was in a pritty big PA ( Power Abusers ) guild and all we did was trapping people. Telling them to give up there boots (30k gold) and we let them live.
---
There was a cap on kills you could make being the aggresor. So if they payed we had another "spot" to kill someone.
---
If they didn't payed we waited to drop combat so only 1 had the "unjustified kill" on his name and we could continue for hours and hours.
---
Sometimes after they payed there boots we just asked for the next item untill he stopped paying, and than we killed him.
---
That game is so diffrent than the "anti griefing" "honor" and zero penalties we have in wow.
---
Griefing in Tibia was a form of skill. Killing someone without drawing skull ( starting the fight by being the aggresor) was seen as a good move. Pulling a shitton on mobs and blocking the way of the other guy untill he got agroo and died. 
---
I miss how hardcore these games were
---
Yeah I‚Äôm unemployed and use my welfare cheque to pay for all 40 of my wow subs
---
hanging out in Shittrash city doing nothing waiting on next raid or dungeon group because the world now means nothing. Yup fond memories.
---
It was always DM you fucking weirdos, Dire Maul wasn‚Äôt out so people called dead mines DM. Then the transition happened
---
lol ur dumb
---
watch the video.
---
I hope it's name was "Smaug" :D
---
I did something similar in Alterac as warlock. Sneak around the front lines with two buddies and summoned ~10 people into the backline to tap Gy there. In some cases directly into a small pocket next close to the last boss.
---
That would always break the stalemate a one way or another üòÅ
---
Flying mounts were fine in tbc. It wasnt until cata brought them to Azeroth that it was a problem
---
might as well not get it at 40.   
---
getting to 40 took so long I keep forgetting I even have a mount.
---
Not really a question, but venting frustrations.
---
Screw quests that require me to camp a vendor or buy a recipe on the AH. Camped the vendor for 3+ hours yesterday and never once saw the pattern. 
---
Checked the AH as well and nothing. literally only need the pattern to create two pairs of gloves for turn in. Will never use it after that.
---
About to buy two pairs of gloves for 7G instead of the pattern from the vendor for 35S. Have the mats and everything too....
---
Yeah pve scrubs :)
---
Wow, everyone going ‚Äùdude it‚Äôs a joke!!‚Äù while clearly missing that you were joking
---
in a pvp realm? you had to have right clicked something with a pvp flag, even if you didn‚Äôt attack it, it‚Äôll still mark you. maybe the orc near one of the shops in gadget. the one for chen‚Äôs empty keg
---
It's not her ability. Every mob queues up melee attacks when being kited, how is that not a bug?

12 years enough for you or do I go deeper

why BC started wows decline
---
*Flying Mounts
---
*Daily Quests
---
*Time Gated Progression (Heroics/Dailies)
---
*Badges from Dungeons
---
*Corridor Style Dungeons
---
*Easier Access to Epics
---
*Stat "rating"
---
*Resilience
---
*Class and Faction homogenization
---
*Hub Cities (Shattrath)
---
*Portals for easy world travel
---
*Removal of Attunements (After putting them in well)
---
*Too many limited time items compelling you to play nonstop, for example every arena season
---
What if a dps warrior tanked a dungeon but then also rolled against the dps players that also need the items he needs? Why does it have to be on reserve?
---
What gloves do you wear? Why do they look so worgish?
---
about 2/3 of a quests xp are the killed mobs anyway, now factor in the time you need to walk to and from the questgiver/location, the time to read the quest and so on - it becomes pretty obvious
---
i laughed in paladin until i realized paladins suck at everything
---
How do you cancel your HS queue?
---
I count 1 crit and 1 dodge as 14 of a stat. Mathetmatically it depends on a lot of factors. For example the more AP you have, the better crit becomes and the more crit you have, the better AP becomes.
---
Why 14 then? Well, that's the rating-amount that the 1% crit was converted to in Patch 2.0 in preparation for BC.
---
By looking at the ballpark in which these ratings related to the other stats, we can assume that their value on an item is about equal to that of primary stats.
---
So according to that the latter item is much more valuable, as it has a sum of 9+6+14+14=45 "points", while the former only has 29.
---
It's the other way around. Warlock is god for solo farming/elite farming and people actively whisper warlocks if they want to go MC (because of banishes are required for Garr). Lock is also very good for PVP.
---
Sorry to hear that - that's rough.  
---
The fact they remove the option to practically leave is horrendous, and it does look like Athene in adopting a similar stance.  
---
Here's hoping this one huge elaborate troll at some point down the line...
---
exactly as its spelled? Scholomance?
---
I hope we get the pre-nerf damage for a while.
---
It‚Äôs a video game lol.
---
I play Druid so I don‚Äôt care about reserves - hardest thing to get is spirit weapons.
---
I won‚Äôt willingly join a group that‚Äôs reserving mounts but as others said if it‚Äôs a majority guild run of course people are reserving the mount, they‚Äôll get people to run too because some people either don‚Äôt care about the mount or need gear over cosmetics.
---
People reserve orbs for money should that not be allowed?
---
It‚Äôs all within the theme of the game.
---
It really comes down to what YOU want to do and that‚Äôs the joy of the game. If you‚Äôre seriously getting upset over some dude that‚Äôs reserving items/mounts I‚Äôll say that you need to take a video game less seriously and enjoy it. They don‚Äôt affect you an ounce.

As the late great George Carlin once said

ive got a cpl dozen runs through UBRS and have see only 2 of the offhands so far. Luckily for me i got a Viskag out of an ony pug a cpl weeks ago so i dont have to worry about it

as a neet i had to change when I sleep and play, 2 hours of playing at 4-6am was sooooo much more efficient and enjoyable than playing all of late afternoon. I barely even want to log in on weekends in the daytime unless I'm gonna run dungeons.

I'm down for some serious fair wpvp fights! 1v1 wpvp fights is what I enjoy most in WoW, even though I'm a warrior. 
---
You can get so creative in wpvp.
---
not sure if I confused you, but that's literally what I wrote out. maybe OP can get his item restored.
---
So I rolled on a PvE server due to all the horrible stuff about perma ganking written here. Originally I played vanilla on a PvP server and didnt find the ganking during levelling to be much of a problem, but I guess I was strongly behind the curve, so it wasnt so bad.
---
My problem is: I like PvP a lot especially BGs were my thing back in the day to a lesser extend wPvP (I can also do without, though it feels a bit strange to not have the other faction on red). Now I'm considering rerolling on a PvP realm but of course I would use a lot of progress (not 60 yet, but I'm a slow leveler). 
---
Do you think its worth it? Do you have any indication of how well I will still be able to do BGs when they drop? I heard its going to be cross realm from the start, but just PvE servers in one pool and PvP on another, or how will it work? I'm scared that no one will queue on the PvE servers...

Inb4 the chat explodes in 1 second..

wow, you won this :D

but thats great that we can find what to do for so longs time :3
---
Where can a level 36 hunter get a nice Pole Arm? Bought a green off AH lil while ago, but wondering if there's a super cool one i should be aiming for?
---
&gt;except a minute or two of time running back to your corpse
---
There are some longer corpse runs in the higher level zones.
---
RFD can give some great XP, along with multiple quests, and some nice drops. If you‚Äôre having no luck finding a group maybe try starting your own and posting LFM in the looking for group channel or trade/barrens chat

Sometimes it's just hard to find a group, because everyone thinks every hunter loots all the stuff.
---
Sad
---
Bro. I was the only fury warrior in a raid who needed them, with no rogues.
---
Then it dropped, and I was so sure it would finally be mine.
---
And then the hunter pressed need and won it...
---
I legit stopped playing for 2 weeks.
---
Just came back yesterday for a Molten Core pug, and guess who was in it: the god damn hunter.
---
And to top all that off, he wasn't even wearing the Dal Rend.

Fuck these weapons. I'll just rock Thrash Blade and Mirah's Song, I don't even care about them anymore.

The thing is, if dungeons/raids get fixed now,  all players who alrdy spammed them (also with layering ignoring the weekly raid CD and using up 10 weeks in a day) and got their gear, from pre raid to full tier1-2, will have a even higher advantage over other players who didn't used intentionally bugs and layers to lvl faster.
---
Blizzard didn't banned anyone and will not do so. They would HAVE to ban in first place everyone who even just put a finger on bugs/layer abuse for at least the weekly raid cd time they bypassed + 1 month (maybe 4 month) + setting their account to zero. Whole guilds would be vanished away. 
---
This would be a appropriate punishment for going into the game knowingly using bugs to get a huge advantage over all other players.
---
Then you can say, it's ok to be fixed. But that's work, and this is the reason it'll never happen, because Blizzard does not work anymore. They just use old stuff, don't fix known bugs and outsource their work for new games to China.
---
[My exact reaction](http://imgur.com/vwMin). Funny enough, she told me the exact same response. She told me that, the reason she hasnt played all these years since her last time is because she really *does* enjoy the game.. but she's afraid of getting addicted and she doesn't want to waste her life playing a video game. That's when I stepped in and explained to her that there is nothing wrong with having a hobby like this that you enjoy doing.. and that is an avenue to take your mind off our adult life and *relax* (although WoW can be stressful). My biggest selling point that I took time to explain was that, **Yes** it's a video game-- but she will be spending time *with me* while playing.. whether I'm by her side or I am at work, since I'm able to play at work, she will be playing with me. And she eventually understood that and liked that. I told her she won't be *wasting* her life, per se, if she plays in moderation and does have control over herself.. understanding Real Life priorities.
---
\*sword. come on guys its a sword and not a dagger, the best dagger is assassins blade afaik
---
It's not layering.
---
You do get +sp gear (and greens with +heal), but more importantly you get new ranks of spells and if you are only using the max rank spell then RIP your mana pool
---
Cdew if he prays to the RNG god.
---
Snutz will win.
---
Can't call it any different now, tyvm
---
Stv made me put my warrior aside for a bit and level a rogue just to go kill hordes as revenge grrr
---
Do a /played every hour just to increase stress levels. As long as it doesnt break you it does make you more aware of the time passing and every little inefficient thing you do.
---
Yes it is just you. You will get the same answers from people as you would looking up the info on Google.
---
But there was moderation in tbc. They were introduced but not ridiculous yet. 
---
Regardless, as a business blizzard will choose to expand to tbc. It's basically free money and longevity. The few elitist that quit wont outway the nee people who come specifically for tbc and the extra two years of subs.
---
Anything else is too risky and a business wont pay for somthing new that could fail when they can just follow what is already working with classic wow.
---
So you should get ready for it anyway
---
Dont forget consumables for each gear set, bandages, reagents. I as a hybrid shaman walk in with at most 30 free slots into dungeons. Cause that one time i leave a gearset in the bank.... i need it cause healer dc'd or something v.v
---
She destroyed me on one of my runs with a single contact 9 hit-attack. Normally if she gets close she gets a 6 hit-attack but the 9-hit really was insane....it has to be a bug.
---
&gt; considering this subreddit's primary demographic
---
Dang this subreddit for not being blizzard programmers!
---
How'd you die?
---
One tiny part of my reasoning yes. The part about the icon while ignoring the rest of it. Like I told others, be communicative instead of making up your own rules and acting as if they are some set rules to follow.
---
Priests are weak untill you get to that point 
---
you spend your entire leveling experince having to run away from fights
---
then at about the level range you say , you dont have to anymre and you can make everyone pay for all the times you bastard ass alliance fucked us over

Just hit level 36 last night as a Warrior. The current leveling guide I'm using I'd like to be 1-2 level ahead of the recommended. 
---
I was thinking about just running some SM to get some easy xp and gold.
---
I have the BoneBiter and Ravager (1 more level to go to be able to use it).
---
For Graveyard and Library can I just "tank" using my 2 hander and in Battle Stance? Just use Demo shout, WW, sunder Armor? 
---
And switch to sword and board (maybe) for bosses?
---
Because nobody wants to farm a boss x4 more times than they have to. If you're doing arena runs as a warrior, you want to try to fill the group in with people that won't roll on the Savage Gladiator Chestpiece if it drops. It already has a 1% drop, so why would you want to lower your odds even further just for the sake of including some random?
---
Sho-lo-mance
---
please tell me i am correct. This is no Show or school, right?
---
It's better then asking questions and relying on others to answer then for you.
---
What the hell? How the hell did this bug go unnoticed for so long?
---
In today‚Äôs time of age of internet, usually the first guide or anything you see first more than likely ‚Äúpaid‚Äù to be their and usually isn‚Äôt their by peer reviews
---
Example: go google ‚Äúlawyers‚Äù and depending on your search engine, and what Ads they use and different lawyers are gonna pop up first depending on how paid for that slot.
---
Comparing this to wow is a bit of an extreme but it‚Äôs the world we live in, where money &gt; information
---
Not saying I distrust them. It‚Äôs which one should I trust the best more or less.
---
Personal loot is unfair in a way that the worst player might get lucky but the best player not. With masterloot you can reward better players. Not necessarily mechanically better players but those who put in more effort. Personal loot could give eye of sulfuras to an idiot that blows up the raid with geddon bomb. Ofc a corrupt lootcouncil is bad too but at least players have control and not rng.
---
You're an allstar.  [https://www.wowace.com/projects/dr-damage](https://www.wowace.com/projects/dr-damage)
---
Spec Fury/prot 31/20. You'll be able to tank dungeons and you won't lose that much total dps and now you have the utility of being able to off tank raids. You won't have any tactical mastery or anger management which is a pain but it's definitely worth it. Warriors are a good hybrid class in vanilla. 
---
You'll need decent gear but most of the time you'll want to use fury gear for tanking dungeons too. It's important to know when to switch to shield and what fights you need proper tanking gear but for the most part you don't.
---
Caer Darrow School of Necromancy?/ School of Magic for the Murder Inclined?

This is the beauty of WoW. Enjoy it however you like!

True. I usually tell people to go for need if we have an epic BoE drop just because somebody will always need if greed is agreed upon beforehand nonetheless.

Idk if they do or not. You should google it.

I play Horde on Benediction. I‚Äôm enjoying the server a lot I believe it‚Äôs pretty balanced horde vs alliance. Alliance outnumber horde probably 55% to 45%. (At least that‚Äôs what it was when that census came out a few weeks ago.) But I haven‚Äôt noticed being extremely outnumbered really ever yet. My main is level 53 undead mage. You can add me if you end up creating a character here :) in-game name is Sliq
---
UC chat for a paladin seems like bad advice
---
i was always planning on calling it ‚Äúdire‚Äù
---
ty for your answer, seems like a good plan. I'm really concered about the economy of my server though, it's a german pve server (lol) and I highly doubt there're many high level priests running around dropping 200g on pre-raid stuff. Hope I am wrong :/
---
Stop stop too much brain work for this guy
---
There is an ability called "Thrash" that a large amount of mobs have access to. It queues up attacks while they aren't in range or are CC'd. Not every mob can, but lots do
---
Can you proq it of wingclip ? That is pritty big and good to know :)
---
It is a smiley. A cartoonical depiction of a face
---
Be careful with the AH, you will lose something in the region of 20g if you sell it there compared to advertising it in trade chat. Even if you decide to put it up on the AH, advertise it anyway.
---
Which vendor addon is that?
---
So don't join, or roll a tank yourself.
---
My guess is that a lot of people did not remember whether they were bosses or not, and didn't report it as a result.
---
Very fitting that the title of this meme is "for the alliance" have yet to have one 1v1 me successfully but got ganked leveling the whole time lol
---
Just noticed your post says you play alliance.. rip :P
---
As long as you are still willing to change forms as needed you are fine
---
Hello fellow Bigglesworth! Ya zerg guilds will always exist. I personally prefer the concept of up to 2 raid teams including a handful of alts in various roles.
---
clearly a mage weapon
---
if it wasnt.. why would blizz make it so mage can use maces??
---
Is this why my blessings keep dropping off in way under five minutes? Keeping in mind Im solo questing with only three buffs.
---
The flying anywhere was the opposite of great.
---
nice price for that unit!
---
yeah would take 15" or 17" as a desktop replacement, so the size isn't *that* important. But if I'd have the option, I'd definetly go for the 15" variant.
---
My favorite is when the DPS warriors charges the mob I just range pulled so I could LoS.  Like bro, I have less than 1 AA worth of threat on that mob and 0 rage. Dude now has face aggro on the entire pack...ya dead son.
---
Not on my server. Someone(5+ people) are there all hours of the morning day and night.
---
I played a character named Nopes for a while on retail. Everyone thought it was hilarious to reply to requests from me with "Nopes". Got old really fast.
---
Always VC for me too (Illidan NA)
---
two handed weapons can have swing speeds of up to 4.0 (4 seconds). a "slow" two handed weapon would be 3.3 or above, IMO, although definitions may vary. a "fast" two handed weapon would be 2.7 speed or below, e.g. manual crowd pummeler.
---
One handed weapons (apart from wands and daggers) can have swing speeds of up to 3.0, although I think in practice you don't see weapons slower than 2.8 speed. a fast one handed weapon would be 2.0 speed or below, for a paladin (again, just IMO).
---
I agree
---
Again, it's like the toilet paper roll debate
---
It's funny
---
It's not a personal attack on you that they're being funny and saying their way is right
---
WTF !!! what am I doing here??? please time god undo my last 5 minutes.. I will never read any child post again
---
All right, I guess I‚Äôll have to keep play wow then.
---
Nah, it's not. DM is Deadmines, DM-E/N/W/T is Dire Maul.
---
VC is Van Cleef, Deadmines is more than Van Cleef, ergo VC isn't Deadmines. Just like MC isn't Rag, BWL isn't Nef and Ahn'Qiraj isn't C'thun. Stratholme Undead isn't Baron, Straholme Living isn't Balnazzar, LBRS isn't Wyrmthalak, UBRS isn't Drakki. Do I need to continue?
---
Look at that asshole with the death charger, god what a dick!!!
---
I'm aware of that, I'm just venting my salt lol
---
Yes clearly that is what I meant, as opposed to talking about the post gaining traction in the sense that it will reach the front page and therefore get more attention which could possibly expedite the fixing process since it's clear that blizzard has CMs that pay attention to reddit and could relay the information.
---
Why *wouldn't* you do that? Shit, man. With Health Stones, Bandages and food there's not much of an excuse to expect a healer to be topping you off 100% of the time unless there's a lot of raid/group damage going out.
---
no one ever post DM east, west all this bullshit. just DM and once people started joining group then we discussed what we doing. full clear, west, tribute etc.
---
new kids on the block need to get a reality check.
---
These weapon speeds are more towards a 1h, I‚Äôd expect a paladin is probably leveling ret with a 2h. Slower weapons are going to be &gt;3.2 speed.
---
D
---
My guess is that they changed Ironaya in patch 1.3 or so, when they also changed some other bosses in Blackrock Spire to not be level ?? bosses, such as (I presume) Wyrmthalak, Gyth, and Shadow Hunter Vosh'gajin.
---
gehennas full, don't come here!
---
this is what i did for my warrior and again when i got bonebitter and will keep doing it as it a "ok" enchant but the cost is very low, like less than a gold.
---
Tanked for the first time yesterday on my lvl 13 druid. It was... messy to put it nicely.
---
I named one of my frogs Ghelihast
---
8 days 4 hours. Not sure what the overall average is, but it was faster than the majority of the 2 guilds I've been in so far.
---
Taking control of someone elses character is a hostile act.
---
Just got my mount last night and had like 3g after it was paid for. By the time I logged off 3 hours later I had like 30g.  After 45 gold comes pretty easily

I'm not the one that made a post about how I screwed up and abandonned my pet you hunter scrub.
---
Now go catch another pet and lvling it. Blizzard doesn't care about lost pets babyface so that's the best you can do.
---
Guess you gotta farm at a different time then
---
Is it that bad and full?
---
Cdew is praying against rng. Depending on tourney setup he could have a bad couple of matches and be out of the competition. Or if he gets a bunch of good WF procs he could two shot some casters. 
---
He definetly has a chance to win but it's not gonna be about skill really. Past his basic class and player skill hes just hoping for crit/WF procs.
---
A good warlock will best him
---
Some people just carry it too far. Legendaries, might, mageblade, leaf/eye and ragnaros reserved!
---
Not actually following any more. 
---
Moving forward doesn't imply personal attacks, does it?
---
Engineering + whatever is the most lucritive on your server. Unless you're playing a caster there is no class specific reason to pick a certain profession
---
*Laughs at paladin*
---
They said first patch, if the first patch was phase 2 they would simply have said phase 2. So it's somewhere before that.
---
https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/2151660790
---
That was one i think. Check config.wtf make sure its set to opengl
---
&gt;And so because you haven't seen tanks being flamed yet that means it never happens?
---
I never said it doesn't happen. I said if you're an average tank/person, it shouldn't be happening a lot like op is saying.
---
You know, a lot of people here do quite a lot of djs and have guild mates who do the same in every role. That means we actually have quite the sample size when talking about these tings.

 I want Moiraine more than anything I've ever wanted in my entire life. Imagine your childhood desire to receive a coveted toy, or your urge to eat your favorite meal after a long day. Now imagine this urge tenfold. Nay, hundredfold. I imagine us basking in each other's glow while we sit in front of the fireplace. The Shawshank Redemption is on, but we're not really paying attention, because we can't stop thinking about pressing our bodies together and creating the beautiful musical melody of love and passion. I enter her as we become one singular being, a being of lust and yet, simultaneously, of tenderness. These thoughts have consumed my life. It started out small: I would think of plunging my chivalrous shaft into her luscious pink body during lunchtime or a spare moment. But this built and built until all I can think of, during all hours of the day, is serenading Moiraine  with my harmonious love songs that I wrote just for her while I caress her pink body, the encapsulation of sensuality, and engulf myself within her pink radiance. I imagine her hat closing us off from the rest of the humanity as we engage in unspeakable escapades within our own private little world. That's what I want. That's what I need.
---
No youre 100% right dude, everything existed back then. Its just much much more prevalent. A simple example of this is back then, when you asked where something was, you mainly got directions like 7/10 times for me. Nowadays? 9/10 times youll get coords cause its assumed everyone has it. Back then, bis lists werent as widely spread until t3

weekdays 3h queue, weekends between 4-8hours.
---
unless you play midday then it's none like all servers.
---
2-3 hour queues at prime time every night.
---
priest is great to level solo if done right. You will also be a tough 1v1 for most classes out in the world questing 
---
Normally it's only rogues jumping me on our server - it's a fight you can win even if you didn't open
---
This is practically impossible.  In 2 hours there would only be a total of 40 Devilsaurs even spawn.  Finding and killing 30+ of them in that time is extremely unlikely. At least it is on any server with medium or high pop.
---
I don't know man, usually in chat we check who knows the instance well and follow whoever that is. IF nobody knows, we just open up guides online and have a laugh while getting shat on for a couple hours. That's been my experience at least, generally when there is a toxic player in a group he is just kicked out and replaced.
---
That's it. I am going to level a rogue as my secondary character. Is subtlety vialable for leveling?

---
You make it sound like prices are the same across all realms.
---
Most this info about PvP realms is easily mitigated by grouping up in the hot zones - which is personally what I think the goal was to begin with in the design of these zones.
---
Even the part about STV is weird to me, since early STV implies you're lower level which then makes you a more easily ganked target by any 60s running around. Also, I've personally had less issues in southern STV as it's literally Nessingwary's camp that gets sat on by various ganking groups on my server at least.

I'm fine with rage being based on attacks. More crits = more rage means I'll just have more fun the more gear I get.
---
What really bothers me is starting at 0. Rogues start combat at max energy and can immediately fight. Warriors have to charge or bloodrage and still not have enough for the first abilities (bloodthirst costs 30).
---
Just seems quite excessive for a green item
---
It really isn't if you're a tank or melee dps. I can write the whole list if you'd like but standard dps consumes and most importantly temporary healing effects such as hots, inspiration, shields will make you reach the cap really fast. Tanks in good guilds are legitimately only able to use like 1-2 consumables because otherwise they'll get overcapped with temp buffs and lose Songflower or WCB or Rallying Cry.
---
Yeah I'm 47 and I'm at 110g after getting mount at 40
---
If you scroll down you‚Äôll see my update post already stating it was fixed.
---
Dude you need to learn to read if you want to burn people online. 2 times you served me a perfect smash. Don‚Äôt let me get you a 3rd time and just downvote this post instead of replying and showing just how retarded you are.
---
He should have been kicked immediately after he caused the second wipe. Causing one wipe is more than enough warning to quit your bullshit.
---
you can lockpick everything except UBRS.
---
If blizzard have CMs paying attention, I'm sure they've seen this topic. I'm not even a CM and this is the second time I've seen it.
---
As a lvl 60 warlock, what are your go to spots for farming soul shards?
---
Outplayed
---
Yeh I don't fully understand layering. All I know is when I join a group with my friend the pretty herb vanish and people appear like on retail lol
---
Do you have any idea what efficient means?
---
As for duo farms, I‚Äôd farm for big ticket items like Eye of Shadow or Mature Blue Dragon Sinew
---
Pretty damn useful for it to scan chat though, especially when it's flooded with a bunch of runs you don't want. I just set it and forget about it till it pops up. It lets you know if anyone says anything remotely related to the instance you're looking for (LFM and LFG), I don't see how you think that's doing nothing. Plus I have lookingforgroup in a different window because honestly all that spam is obnoxious.
---
I was playing yesterday and was 98% down with the escort quest.  This 25 gnome mage comes and ganks me. He was a few levels above me in the middle of all these furbolgs.  I still got him almost dead on my 26 disc priest with several mobs on me.  He knew I was on an escort and still attacked me.  Special place in hell for those people.
---
I use 1H and that's what I was thinking of for sure, so thanks
---
Never hear of VC until a month ago, on Reddit. It's still correctly called by it's actual name on my server.
---
The problem is that Equip effects like +% hit/crit/spellpower/healing are all considered buffs as well. You'll be near 30 before the 20+ consumable buffs available.
---
How bad is your ability to understand that what people were doing in videos in 2006 would correlate to the same information they would write on post?
---
So by your logic the best guilds in game at the time were using shitty strategies and horrible itemization but telling other people the correct way and the best items to use on a forum/post?
---
Did I say enchants? No.
---
Heh, I'm at 1g because I started buying stuff from my trainer.
---
Saw a main and off hand both drop at the same time few days back :D could not care less as  a druid.
---
I think the ease of MC can mostly be chalked up to common knowledge of what is pre-BiS, a preponderance of strategy guides, as well as having 1.12 class balance. I don't think the Molten Core levels and health or damage values are inconsistent with patch 1.12, but yeah it's gonna be a whole lot easier than 1.1 Molten Core when your raid isn't really familiar with what's going on.
---
I could be wrong about that, but with respect to the UBRS bosses, I know that is incorrect.
---
Care to elaborate?
---
And yet, with over 331+ runs between 13 people it still has not dropped once. So with a 10% drop rate we should have seen 33 times by now mathematically. So again man, stop trying to sound like everything is as intended.
---
X marks the spot.
---
I played EU alliance on vanilla and no one called it VC. Might even be a regional thing.
---
What type of dumb ass question is that though? ‚ÄúOut of every single weird ass character name to name a kid, which, if not all of those would be weird?‚Äù
---
Pretty much.  At that rate it would take years to level them all up.
---
I‚Äôve been trying for like 15 minutes. Just PM me if you don‚Äôt want it public.

*Bloodseeker intensifies*
---
Fuck me, why do we use the term MS paint for Microsoft then.
---
Oh shit I live in Singapore, why is the acronym SG?
---
Fuck me, did you know BL is going to be out in later phases? Badlands is already out? No no, Blackwing Lair. Why do we call it BWL?
---
&gt; if you are constantly getting flamed as a tank, you might be a bad tank.
---
There's no *might* about it.  If you're frequently catching shit as a tank, then it's not them - it's you.  I was an MT in vanilla.  Tanked everything from Lucifron to Four Horsemen, and countless Scholo/Strat/UBRS PUGS.  I read these posts from Warriors bitching about how hard it is to be a tank, and how they're bigger martyrs than Jesus Christ...ffs.  Honestly, I think tanks have the highest concentration of soft players in the game.
---
Guess it all depends on how much you‚Äôre sitting on right now.. I had 65 gold at level 39 and had mount money before 41 by doing nothing different and just questing/vendoring
---
I'm worried about this actually - not being an engineer.  Is there no way to get the key for the door if you're solo running DM north?  I'm willing to drop my professions and pick up mining/engineering in order to do the farm - but I don't want to if I don't have to.
---
Nice!
---
Blizzard literally had to re create classic. I‚Äôm sure they can add a few ramps or teleport pads around tbc.
---
45 Paladin here. Great server and there‚Äôs plenty of lower levels to still group up with for questing and dungeons. Pretty active community during peak hours, but you‚Äôll be better off solo questing during the off-peak time. That being said, you‚Äôll still find the odd group for popular dungeons like Deadmines/Stocks/SM
---
Thanks we'll give those a try!
---
Boe greens are so exciting around 30. then once blues hit i cant sell 50+ greens even ones that seem insane (plate helmet with 17 def??). In the end i just shelled out the gold for dwarven handcannon.
---
They're not ambigious since Dire Maul is run in wings. It's also pretty dumb to have a dungeon referred to as its last boss.
---
As opposed to sitting in a zone spamming trade and world chat for your LRBS run?
---
Those rock elemental homies in the badlands are pretty good
---
Anyone got census info on Herod?
---
Such a strange guild to see like my guild has well over 700 players and runs 2 ony's per week aswell as full clearing MC so in my case it just seems odd that players struggle to hold onto level 60s.
---
How so?  What's broken about vanish?
---
[See my above comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dhimyv/its_happening_everyone_wish_her_luck_my_wife/f3oxvfe) for explanation :)
---
&gt;would visit again
---
trust me , you will visit this damn island more times than you'll like....  
---
luckily the return journey can be done by mage portal
---
God it's funny how many people still get butt hurt about being wrong calling it VC.
---
Using their flawed logic that people used to want to group for the Vancleef quest, ergo the dungeon gets called VC.
---
A 5 year old can see the flaw in that logic. If you cannot, you are part of the problem.
---
Give tanks a few seconds before you start attacking. Make sure you Target their target. If you pull aggro take the mob to the tank so they don't have to chase you
---
Strat, scholo and brd are all able to done with lock picking. Need 300 for scholo and Strat (and it can fail, but just try again)
---
As if the world in vanilla somehow meant more? Lol
---
Precisely, and then we say DMW DME and DMN, right?
---
I rolled a Druid to tank dungeons on my way to 60, and that's essentially all I've done when going into Dungeons. Besides the other night when we couldn't find a healer and had an extra tank in the group so I gearswapped and role-changed.
---
Healing is the most laid-back shit I've ever done. Literally just watching health bars and throwing out some HoT's. It's insane how much easier it is than tanking.
---
RIP the bank space lol
---
That's not a real scenario in my experience.  The reality was that the best raid increase was always replacing the worst piece of gear you had from the group, collectively.  There was always someone who had the worst bracers or the worst boots or something that was significantly behind the rest of the group's gear which equated to a bigger upgrade overall.
---
One level too late;)
---
I simply don't have the information available to have any reason to believe you.  I didn't honestly pay much attention to the race.  What you're saying is a bit strange in retrospect though.  You had the lead until a mid 40s dungeon, and for some reason that means you should have won?  The whole thing is predicated on the idea that the guild you claim to be in wouldn't have used the xp bug themselves had they became aware of it, and that's something we all know is a lie.  So instead of admitting that they were able to do it better, you make an excuse for why you couldn't.  I never even heard of Progress to be honest, until you mentioned it here.
---
Spaceforce on Skeram?!
---
Dude, google up BRYCE canyon.
---
This is real 1k needles.
---
Absolute worst case scenario is we have our choice to play Classic, BC, Wrath, Cata, MoP, WoD, Legion, and BFA. Just because the masses flock to the new ‚Äúclassic‚Äù releases doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre forced off. We still have Classic this time around.
---
If he has anyone to play with.  A lone warrior with a legendary is just as scary as guy with a green weapon.

Jesus christ, judging from the other replies to him and his replies to those replies, this guy is a real first grade asshole who thinks he's fucking hilarious.
---
Wrong or not is none of my concern. 
---
This invalidates the whole 'It never happened at all back then so it's wrong.'
---
If you want to show other methods why it was wrong, be my guest. Just saying it is wrong doesn't make it so, BTW.
---
perd blade drops off Rag, why wouldn't that be in the game currently?
---
Wait for DM, farm lasher+tribute runs and share gold
---
Forgot about the nicker. I just refuse to play with it out of personal reasons. It just is god damn awful looking that I rather farm 1000g for Arcanite Reaper and sport Demonshear for the time being than equip that thing. :D
---
However it's decent weapon and fairly easy to acquire when hosting LBRS 3boss runs which can be done in 20mins per run.
---
If you pull the Ghost Citizens in Strat by accident /Dance will drop them from combat
---
Why would horde call it VC to begin with? A boss of a dungeon they typically wouldn't even run? I have no idea what the last boss of RFC is called.
---
Also, it's DM.
---
That's true! I'm not worried about it, I have plenty of buttons and I use alt as alternate target (sometimes as self cast but usually as focus target which hasn't been invented yet)
---
Do mars runs and MINE!! There‚Äôs a solid 3-4 nodes you‚Äôll run into each Mara reset which is way more than I‚Äôd run into the open world per hour
---
Wow head contains 99% of information needed, and Icy Veins contains 60%.  It's hilarious to go back and read the 15 year old comments in wowhead....so take those with a grain of salt.  Most comments (on item pages) are arguments about which class an item is better for.  It's pretty entertaining.
---
I on the other hand don't understand how a guild with over 700 players functions. My guild has a really sweet community and I just don't see that being possible with so many voices talking over one another.
---
But they said they were going to let Classic exist for a long time. Just because BC is out doesn‚Äôt mean you have to play it.
---
I was looking for a deadmines group on a pserver before launch and got a pm saying something along the lines of "Hey! Next time you should say VC instead of DM or else you might get another lv 60 very excited :)" 
---
I was like bruh you can shift click my name and see that I'm not doing dire maul
---
With the release of Dire Maul, would it be expected for the price of Runecloth Bags to rise or fall?
---
I mean he's going to have to explain the hammer.
---
Try not skipping your meds. You sound like a fucking weirdo. Settle down.
---
I got insanely lucky and saw two Ironweavers on the AH for 1g each right when I hit the minimum level to use that gun. My silly brain was like, "just buy one since you don't need two and let someone else buy the other one!"
---
...every so often I mentally kick myself for that and now make sure to just buy things that are basically marked FREE TO GOOD HOME on the AH to gift or resell.
---
I prefer Vead Cines
---
yeah this peripheral aggro thing has happened to be several times and I'm sure it didn't used to be like this from vanilla-woltk.
---
What happens is I'm attacking a mob, another player aggroes another mob nearby, then either dies or runs away, then that mob is tapped by that player, but aggroed onto me. So I have to kill someone else's mob.
---
Too easy to shut down, next
---
I've been looking into transferring to earthfury but just can't bring myself to do it due to the pop. I've never seen it past medium on server select and when I log in and /who class 60 the only one that ever seems to have more than 50 is mages. The AH also only has about 10k listings and a lot of niche items just don't show up. 
---
From a server that is still using layers perspective it seems a bit dead.

yea people forget about both of those. for 1 you need to pick up the pikes in the first part of the instance however

for 2 its fun but ive noticed that ren just gets deleted now so the dragon doesn't do much, its cool to see peoples reactions however

Arena.
---
Also don't be the dick warlock that doesn't bring water. I hate as a healer that a warlock feels entitled to not drink, but to rely on me (and by extent my expensive water) to refill your mana bar.
---
I don't mind you lifetapping during pulls (moar deeps), but if you aren't drinking when I'm drinking and lifetapping to 1% health expecting me to heal you to full prior to the next pull, then your repair bill is going to get pretty high.
---
Help your healers out and be a little considerate.

He has $600 to spend per month on 40 WoW accounts. The guy's either nuts or has so much free money to spare that this is just a play thing for them.

Sounds like OP is a bad tank. Most DPS would deal with some heinous shit before saying anything to a tank bc DPS are a dime a dozen. The only indicator I give
---
What if I don't like sand?  Can I just sit outside the box or is someone going to make me get in?
---
I'm with you, friend. I've swapped back and forth a bit too and daggers are much better. The crits are huge &amp; there's no downtime to heal up when you're 1-2 shotting everything.
---
Ambush, SS, gouge, backstab, eviscerate, loot, stealth, repeat.

best hat to activate in a dungeon, trust me........

Dungeon tanking? Check

Dungeon healing? Check

Dungeon DPS? Check

Leveling Speed? ...not warrior bad.

ST Raid healing? Check

PVP DPS? Check
---
PVP Healing? Check
---
Judgement Set - Best armor in the game? Check

Not to mention all of the tools they bring: bubble, lay on hands, rez, buffs. Pallys are great.
---
There is no need to repeat the multitude of previous valid reasons people have given.
---
Dig your heels into the sand even further and get stuck if you want.
---
Abandoning solid logic shows a clear maturity and reasoning is clearing missing.

Why don't you post the links again, I'm sure that will show how correct you are.
---
Human male has bis melee attack animations imo.
---
Yes please
---
Agreed.
---
Never seen people shit on the tank but I will admit to being lazy and always letting tank lead. I'm DPS so I figure fuckit I go where my tank goes.
---
Every class is a good combo with a druid because druids are just nuts and 2 druids are doubble nuts. =)  
---
If you play 2 druids you need to share the loot and the group organization for dungeons is in my opinion not the best way starting with 2 druids. But these are smaller problems and solvable.   
---
Just play whatever you want because the jurney is the destination.
---
How is this even a criticism? 
---
Each expansion is meant to be a reset.
---
She is invisible. Can't be selected/targeted/attacked with out see invis. The OP is a rogue in stealth. The person coming up to the banker can see the rogue just before they accidentally attack them.
---
Currently 57 on my mage, is there a build that provides decent damage in raids while not sacrificing too much for farming and dungeons? So not the standard arcane/frost build
---
Their names would be yellow if he had pvp off.
---
Why would it have been VC? Dire Maul didn't even exist to begin with. People didn't just randomly select ONE dungeon to be named after the boss rather than the actual name. It might have been called VC by the new kids who joined a lot later, but it has always been and will always be DM for the correct acronym.
---
Meanwhile majordomo actually drops items. In 1.0 he had zero loot.
---
‚ÄúBad‚Äù players are still spending their raid lockout and chances at loot on the raid. And ‚Äúgood‚Äù players can really snowball their performance setting themselves apart from their peers because they keep getting more loot.  There are a lot of biases outside the obvious favoritism.
---
Random is random.  You may not like the immediate results but if you play the long game the law of large numbers averages out.
---
/stopcasting works to cancel hs or cleave
---
I think you need to be a rogue, be a blacksmith (blacksmithing key) or be an engineer (seaforium).
---
wth, how were you supposed to kill such a boss with a team of 5 lvl4- ? and how is her loot table so crappy if she really is supposed to be a ?? boss ?
---
Not really a reason to anymore.  People are better at video games now, it shouldn‚Äôt take 10 people to clear either of those dungeons
---
i have: 54 mage, 23 hunter, 20 rogue, 12 warrior, 1 lock, 5 shaman, 1 druid, 7 priest and a lvl 20 bank hunter.
---
yes i main horde why do you ask?
---
I'm currently in a decision struggle.
---
I have an Ultrabook (end - 2016 HP spectre x360 13 inch) currently 3 years old.  
---
It is good for work, as most of the time I develop via Azure cloud and just doing my basic mail/excel/word/ppt stuff on the laptop. Computing power is great (i7, 16 gb rm, 1tb ssd) , the Intel 620 integrated GPU sucks though.
---
It barely plays a game, Wow Classic i get 30 fps at lowest settings at this moment, which is fine, but not smooth.  
---
Since I'm an IT Freelancer and I want to play everywhere I can (train, home, hotels, vacations, ... ),  
---
I'm considering either a gaming laptop - Razer Blade Pro 17 the RTX 2060 version  
---
or a Shadow Tech subscription (comes in at 30‚Ç¨ a month )
---
Both of them I can book as a business expense.
---
The laptop would set me back 2700‚Ç¨ now and will be used as long as it is deducted over the course of 4 years.  
---
If I consider the streaming service, it would be 30‚Ç¨ \* 48 = 1440 over 4 years.
---
So making the calculation makes it cheaper to keep my current ultrabook and just use the stream service.
---
**Now my question is:**
---
I heard some people got banned using services like Nvidia Now, and I was wondering if it would be the same with Shadow Tech?  
---
Does any of u have any experience using streaming services for games like WOW?  
---
How the latency is using these services? If you raid/world pvp does it influence your latency much using it?
---
you do scholo and strath with 5 ppl now. so no raid needed.
---
Just tank the damn dungeon Gil
---
He said in-countered haha
---
Sacrifice the cow!
---
Just normal questing and grinding occasionally, didn't have enough for mount until around level 44.
---
I'm level 58 now and with about 400g. 
---
You just make way more gold at higher levels. Don't stress about not being able to have enough gold, and re-rolling doesn't really help that problem.
---
Cheers, i'll look into it!
---
Huh? I have to curl up my entire hand for thumb to reach C, index finger hits it easily without needing to contort my hand.
---
Hes like, bros, I'm just tryna get to UC.
---
Most people aren't even level 60 yet :)
---
&gt;Thats not what it is. I dont want to be forced to have my computer on all day, 
---
That was only really required in the first week. Like I've said. There is zero queue unless you log in at the busiest times. Which are like 6pm+ and even the  unless it's a sunday you're looking at a 400 queue.
---
&gt;I dont want to have to wait to get disconnected so I can requeue when I have errands, I dont want to have to stay online just so I dont get booted etc.
---
Like I said. Only applies for peak times on busiest days.. and all can be avoided with remote.
---
&gt;I am glad I am on a smaller server so I dont have to plan shit. 
---
Actually.. because you are on a low pop server, there wont be anyone to plan shit with, so problem solved.
---
&gt;I can play when I feel like.
---
I play on one of the biggest servers in EU and I play when i feel like as well. There are also other people to play with when I log in
---
&gt;If you feel like you can handle it, good for you. I dont, as I hate having to plan my gaming sessions, I have enough stuff planned. Good things we can be on different servers
---
How do you plan on getting around zero players for group quests,dungeons and raiding?
---
What level are you? Mostly the people who are bigging up low pop servers have barely even begun leveling
---
Wow I did not know either of these
---
I think he's just confused
---
How important is latency for PVP and at what latency does PVP become not worth trying?
---
you want to level a paladin?
---
the fuck?
---
who the hell says "f.e." and not e.g.
---
Alright i'll give STV another shot! It will probably be worth it with all the quests and exp. Cheers!
---
Level ?? bosses are not actually level 500+ or however these old websites and databases reported them. It's a dynamic level calculation, where the boss acts 3 levels above any players engaging them.
---
Let's say it's patch 1.2 and Ironaya is a level ?? boss. A group of five players‚Äîlevels 40, 42, 43, 41, and 45‚Äîengages her. Her combat calculations would make her act like a level 43, 45, 46, 44, and 48 monster for each player, respectively. This kind of dynamic level is kind of inappropriate for low-level encounters, but not impossible to deal with. That's probably why it was changed shortly after release.
---
Are these even real?
---
Reality is probably a lot of post like in OP's they're just not as flawless as they think they are.
---
Ioneye is more fun to watch IMO
---
Haha understandable!
---
I‚Äôm imagining the opening to Turn the Page by Bob Segar.

But Darnassus is in the north and he ended up running south. That's the point that was being made.

This the dumbest and smartest thing I've heard this week.
---
Gotta love all that that heavy leather!
---
Okay. Well they call it dm on my server. Never seen anyone looking for VC. :p
---
Good find, basically for me the entire game has felt under-tuned (not even taking pservers into account).
---
So any guild that isn't a bunch of sweaties
---
A salty tank main that cant take criticism of a class he chose to. What a joke dude grow up.
---
You need to have a high enough crit rating and then it gets very close to combat sword. But probably not in this first tier.
---
You can run deep frost in raids, every group will need one for the crit debuff for other mages.
---
Remember there are some habilities you learn from pets, so you have skills to learn from every family (boars teachs charge, that you can teach to a bear or turtle  per exemple). one of the most complete I know is here:

---
I never kill lowbies or gank anyone because end all be all, it's a waste of my time at this point. I broke that rule yesterday when I saw a level 38 mage AoE farming the alliance farmers in Arathi. I felt it was the right thing to do.
---
I have a lot of respect for you guys, but if you're the tank then don't complain about having to do tank stuff.  
---
At least in a 5-man the tank is the leader. He should know the dungeon, he should keep an eye on the healers mana, mark targets and keep aggro.  
---
That's a lot more than any other role, but that's your job as a tank - of course you don't get any special privileges for that (except that you can run any dungeon whenever you want because everybody needs a tank).  
---
Of course the healer and the dps should follow the directions and markings of the tank. If they don't do that it's clearly their fault.  
---
If you don't keep an eye on my mana then that's your fault though.
---
Yeah. It's like saying "LFM SM" and not specifying which wing you're running. You obviously say SM armory, SM cathedral or whatever just like you specify what parts of dire maui you want to run.
---
yes. its great tbh!
---
Idk what short bus server you played on, but this is not a thing. Stop trying to make VC happen
---
In a vacuum, a frost mage should always win against a rogue. If he gets first strike, though, it can be over pretty quick (as you noticed).  
---
Start doing battlegrounds to get some practice against rogues in a lower pressure environment. You did good in trying to keep him out of stealth, rogues are sitting ducks when caught off-guard.
---
You can also just fly to gromgol and take the zepp from there, doesn't take much longer than a well planned toilet break
---
I‚Äôm leveling as a sub rogue purely because everyone is combat. The hipster in me just can follow suit.
---
&gt;Undead are the scummiest lol.
---
I have a theory that undead Priests are corrupted by Shadowform when they get it, and that is why they become so hostile around level 40 =)
---
Undead Rogues are scummy from the beginning.
---
Dude you have such a talent for making these things. Every one of them is hilarious and how you capture emotion and reaction and all of the other things without any words is impressive.
---
Yeah thats totally understandable but the way it runs in reality is that we get 40-60 players online during work hours and then like 80-100+ on after work but our GM and raid leads do A LOT of behind the scene's work to make sure everyone gets a chance at raiding and tbh we are all really pleasant to each other and never argue and raid nights are funny instead of being taken seriously because it is 15 year old content after all.
---
Come raid night its an established unspoken rule that during bosses and before bosses only raid leads speak but other than that its just a fun time.
---
Did a double check of our guild and its like 741 members and Id say around 100-150 are alts. We have yet to do the post release clean out though so I imagine we got around 200-400 actual active members

Druid lock is a great combo. Lock has a pet, fear, dots and your hots keep them going like a life tap battery to keep chain pulling.
---
https://youtu.be/bSvIzzkZT5c this video really helped me out in this area, it's basically all about blowing the rogue's CDs and getting in safe damage
---
Combat daggers is very power full. Unfortnatly there are few good daggers before you enter MC.
---
Backstab + slice and dice, not enough eneregy regen to fit evis.

It‚Äôs used for if you are incapacitated (sap, repentance) and if you‚Äôre feared. If you know a fear is coming you can stance dance to zerk stance and zerk rage out of it.
---
I tanked my first BFD and it was just so stressful and taxing.
---
It was my first time there, I had no clue where to go, I had to buff everyone, including pets every 5 minutes. My team wouldn't give me 5 seconds to use consecration, I'm level 25 and have more keybindings than my Lvl 51 mage, I'm spamming dynamite, using judgement, trying desperately to get aggro and I'm just not enjoying it.
---
&gt;A lone undead against the shite of the Alliance?
---
FIFY
---
Pretty much only buying Runecloth that's worth it. Depending on your race and starting point it's a few houndred gold to exalted.
---
I started 2 weeks ago asking in tradechat for lazy people that don't wanna make/have time to bandages to censor it. 1g 1s /stack, 4k until exalted so very close now. Guldies are your friends in this, especially now when everyone is doing tons of BRD runs.
---
For money you could start looking at DM trasher farms, i am not 100% sure it's viable to duo that tho.

Hello! We are Blood Inc.
---
We are an Alliance guild first established in 2005 and are now operating on Mirage Raceway (EU PvE).
---
We have settled nicely into our new home and desire to finish filling our ranks with active and dedicated members for the content clearing journey ahead. Our vision is to have a tight knit group that raid together with little to no rotation of personnel.
---
We are made up of experienced players that have played Vanilla in the past but are open to everyone as long as you have a mature attitude, a desire to have fun and able to get on with your guild mates. Ideally you would be online most evenings and have a desire to raid 2-3 times a week.
---
The Schedule: Molten Core : Wed &amp; Fri 2100 - 0000 Onyxia : Sunday 2100 - Finish
---
Will we distribute loot using a need or greed roll system with the aid of class priority lists.
---
We are currently looking for: 1 - 2 each of Hunters, Holy Paladins and Rogues.
---
Ultimately Blood Inc is all about the fun, the ride and the respect for our fellow gamers. If this is something that resonates with you then please consider membership with us by coming to our Discord and saying "Hello!" Alternatively you can message Togashi, Zeena, Calandor or Beanstalk in game.
---
See you in server!
---

---
Yeah it's quite easy for mages to get into groups due to the aoe especially in SM!
---
So if a classic+ dungeon got released called Shadow Morass, we're all fucked.
---
Not so much in classic as its slower paced than retail for example, i wouldnt try above 300ms but thats because it feels very annoying for me, however i have seen some people make it work just fine
---
Although not a good one to start with since he'll be deing all his stuff instead of selling towards his  mount. On a 2nd char when your main is well established 60, yea
---
Skeram gang rise up
---
It's fun getting to scarlet monastery as alliance on that server
---
As a warrior, at low levels (WC through SM) I would consistently get shaman pulling aggro off me with nothing more than rockbiter autos. I was rage starved enough that if they took aggro off me, I couldn't get it back without taunt. 10/10, would rather have shaman tank below level 30 than a warrior. I'd say a sham would be a perfectly competent tank up to 45 or so, if he geared for it.
---
I totally agree
---
People are definitely much better at mechanics and stuff 
---
It‚Äôs still a mmo created for casuals (even more in classic than retail) so ofc you get a lot of idiots but it‚Äôs still better than when video games of that type where still new and no one had a clue how to do anything at all
---
For the UBRS one, use it when he gets dismounted, or all you tend to get is the heal and not the dragon.  
---
You can also use it for a mass heal as soon as the waves start, which is real handy if totems pull all the mobs from above and everyone is taking damage.  The ring has a very short cooldown so it's up again for Rend.  
---
It does need to be equipped though to be used.  
---
Stratholme Holy Water is a nice aoe bomb for all the undead packs, and doesn't share a cooldown with anything else.
---
Look at the hordies downvoting me, guess they couldn't find any greys to kill
---
&gt; Every. Single. Dungeon. I have ever been in. No one has flamed the tank, not even once.
---
Ofc not this post is completely bullshit.
---
You are absolutely cherry picking; literally picking the serpent sting cherry. Hunters don't scale serpent sting. Clap clap clap. They still scale insanely well on their most important abilities that are AS and MS.
---
Pretty sure there's an alliance fp in booty bay.
---
Interesting. Is this for dungeons and raids? I dont think I've ever seen someone wait to attack in a dungeon but I see it all the time in videos of raids.
---
&gt; Im a 31 rogue and I like to punch up 5+ levels usually
---
I hope I experience this some day. I'd actually be pretty stoked to get attacked out of nowhere by a rogue and actually have a chance to fight back instead of just dying instantly.
---
If you have the chance to open the fight, always use fireball first. Also use rank 1 frostball to keep him perma slow, start running to take some distance and start bursting him down with your spells
---
When a rogue goes stealth, immediately use rank 1 blizzard over them. Also prioritize getting a polymorph first. Once they are polymorphed you get to take your sweet time and cook up a strategy.
---
A tad? A tad, Lloyd? You drove almost a sixth of the way across the country in the wrong direction! Now we don't have enough money to get to Aspen, we don't have enough money to get home, we don't have enough money to eat, we don't have enough money to sleep!

&gt;At least this bug got acknowledged. It is insane to me they deduced the cause but couldn't immediately fix it.

/r/ProgrammerHumor
---
ouch
---
Is there an add-on available to show a dungeon map when in the dungeon? Pressing M just brings up the world map and I‚Äôd like to see the path in the dungeon.
---
You need to be exalted.
---
You can have hemo CB which is best with swords
---
You can have non-hemo CB prep which is great with daggers
---
They have an annoying stun ability.
---
Not a big deal but it slowed my kill rate by a fair amount.
---
As a general rule, if a weapon exists then it's a hunter weapon.
---
This is so insanely incorrect. Blizzard will not moderate cross faction or cross server trades. Entirely at your own risk.
---
Why tho ? 
---
You can half ass through all current pve content with most class combinations
---
Or is it supposed to be a challenge ? 
---
I don‚Äôt get why you‚Äôd go to the trouble of doing that
---
Why not. Lack of healers and tanks so I know I can get a group whenever I want. Plus its just a side project for now. I'm still playing the hunter. Just trying to accumulate some rested xp to make the next lvl easier.
---
Full time +family + gym 5 days a week and I'm 54 priest
---
They are fairly expensive though, 60 silver for 5.
---
Isn‚Äôt this basically the same post you made like 2 days ago?
---
Atlas
---
New skips ahoy!
---
The internet does love to find shit to argue about. DM vs VC is a great example of it. It can't be both, let's fight!
---
Time to pop an invisibility potion and then activate your Orb of Deception.
---
Im sitting at around 170ms, so I should be good?
---
Scholomance wand. I've lost count after 15 attempts (which often were full quest runs that took way too long).
---
We have that patented though.
---
Is that a separate add-on from Atlas Loot?
---
For some reason people buy mithril tubes for 1g+ sometimes, when they cost 50 silver to make. I have no idea why, because they're only used by engineers, and they sell way too slowly to make any reasonable profit \o/
---
You are just bad at wPVP my dude. Mages wreck rogues (I'm a rogue /cry). The moment you are stunned cast blink, frostbolt. When he is in range of nova use it and once again run away and more frostbolts. Close again ice block blink should be up once iceblock is over. Basically you kite them and there is nothing they can do right now. CC is god. Worst case if you dont think you are going to win reset the fight by sheeping them and bandaging to full then evocate up and bam you have a chance to do it all over again. Make sure to wait for your cds before letting him out of sheep though.
---
assume hes talking about the fact that it does not always drop you from combat, which is normal in like a raid
---
Or even better. Make /world a chat that isnt player moderated. 
---
Its completly nuts that it even is. Ppl that gets banned from that chat are considerably hindered when it comes to trying to find a group for dungeons.
---
This. Try being a hunter. Ppl are just waiting to blame you before dungeon even starts.
---
These tanks have a god complex.
---
How tf. This just blew my goddamn mind.
---
i would recommend getting 60 and grind some bis pre raid gear. then start looking for guilds doing MC runs who need people to fill out there team to 40. our guild only has around 32-35 players at  58-60 so we will out empty spots with LFG people and we have kept alot of them when they see how good our guild can clear. we originally started off with just 15 of us. we dont have dowsers yet but still clear 8 bosses a week
---
Well as a rogue its quite eazy to dodge the fights in STV. Just play save and keep sprint and vanish ready for PvP.
---
Goodluck mate
---
VC is some weird ‚Äúlook at me I played vanilla really!‚Äù way of saying it.  Clearly a level 19 in Westfall isn‚Äôt looking for Dire Maul when they are typing in General or Looking for Group
---
Would you give me some examples why that would be great! :)
---
You a cannot do strat og scholo as more than 5 anymore, also there is no reason to bring that many either.
---
World first was over a decade ago.
---
Horde ret is actually pretty good because they get mana back because their seal is amazing.
---
It's viable but I think swords is slightly better most of the time
---
Imagine being proud of rushing 15 year old content lol.
---
Keep Frost barrier and Frost armor up at all time. Since we don't have PvP trinkets yet, try to Ice block the blind.
---
Mage vs rogue is all about suriving the opening. If you survice, it's over for him. If he vanishes or blind+stealth, that's when you need to find a way to fuck off real fast so you can bandage up to full health.
---
Once he can't vanish anymore it's game over for him.
---
Ok, so answer this with your google skills:

I failed to reached in an answer.
---
Erm, do you mean Ragnaros the *Firelord*?
---
They will probably be near the highest dps anyway with the weapons they have but Sunder Armor and Heroic strike both have threat bonuses on them.
---
Yes you do.
---
no i mean, i have not seen horde attack anyone, even when im on my ally character horde don't tend to attack me nearly as often as alliance characters do.
---
??
---
To be fair, you are asking for folks opinion on a situation with no context. Daggers are great tank weapons, but obviously these are great rogue weapons as well. Are all the rogues in the guild playing swords? If they are trying to rock viskag and brutality blade, there‚Äôs really no point in giving them a dagger to sit in their bag.
---
Typical pally/s
---
What's wrong with picking a short name and running guildless so it's difficult to see you while you're in a bush dotting everyone.
---
Probably not slowed as much as having to compete with 5+ others for kills would slow ya though
---
Before this during 7.2 till 7.x something I played on Lucera where the ruling guild was Archangels.
---
But this was back when the highest on the realm was like level 170
---
If its anything like level 25 horde questing in Hillsbrad, its constantly dying to people 20 levels above you because they're too lazy to go level
---
For our server it was DM in caps for Dire Maul, and dm in lower case for deadmines. 
---
Also in general checking the person's level was a good indicator for where they wanted to go!
---
I would expect them to ask me or tell their guildmate that the group is full.
---
I understand it's not a huge deal but it is rude.
---
i quietly blew air out of my nose. you get an upvote

He‚Äôs level 35.

You‚Äôre standing in the danger zone lol

For me it's more like main doesn't have all factions at exalted, still lacking the epic kodo, and no dreadsteed yet. NEED MORE CLOTH
---
It should be for both, although less important in dungeons. If tank doesnt have aggro in a raid it‚Äôs a huge risk of wasting 40 peoples time, as opposed to just wasting 5-10 peoples time. I always give the tank 3-7 seconds depending on the size of the pull before i start dpsing, unless it‚Äôs a lot of non elites i can kite and AOE. Just dinged 60 mage yesterday.
---
Ye ye ok 
---
I just didn‚Äôt see a y point fun or challenge in it neither then or now that‚Äôs all 
---
You‚Äôre free to enjoy it
---
good tip about the blizz.  Hadnt thought of that one. thanks.
---
After getting a character to level 33 in a month with s/o, job, dogs to walk, social life. Not sure why the fuck it took teenager bum me so long to do shit lol.
---
I would go for 60 first. Just level until 60 and start then, no need to rush DM will not disappear
---
No not for lvling. Sub is pretty strong out of stealth and from behind. Try combat
---
Lvl 60 Mage with 300 Tailoring and 225 Enchanting. Would it be more useful to drop Enchanting and go for something else like Herb/Mining?
---
You can absolutely forego raiding entirely and still have a blast playing this game
---
I went super hardcore into raiding in vanilla and then scaled back to dungeons and PVP only for most of TBC. By Wotlk I was doing a little of everything. When I came back for WoD I was basically just soloing for my Garrison development and doing some odd BG ques
---
Herbs are generally a lot harder to see without tracking but most mining nodes stick out without tracking. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd miss a few without switching back and forth. This is what I plan to do when I‚Äôm 60 and not questing anymore going to drop skinning for mining and have herb/mining.

Moonfire, agony, corruption, Immolate,siphon life on everything (I'd also go resto for reflection and iswarm for this) and watch groups rot while you guys dance haha. Gl!

Blizz banns for Bug abuse if it is clear it was not intended that way.

there's a polearm called peacekeeper in strat ud that gives 56 ap and 1 crit. This is superior to the dual dal rend, so I'm not sure why hunters need on them.

don't trust those lists

That's definitely worse. I'd note everyone's name to avoid in the future.

Greater Fire Protection Potion

Mana Pots (ideally Major Mana Potion)

Dark Rune (BoE from Scholomance) / Demonic Rune (BoP from Satyrs in Northern Felwood)

It‚Äôs the entire guild convening and discussing what happened, followed by discussions of Hamish‚Äôs Reddit post. They procede to point out numerous claims that are completely false‚Äîsome outlandish and impossible (ex: ‚Äúthat what‚Äôs his name was gearing up his pocket healer for PvP‚Äîthe paladin he‚Äôs talking about literally doesn‚Äôt PvP).

I love it. We must sacrifice the living to develop a new plague for our Dark Lady.

Seriously, also full time worker, just hit 40 on my warlock last week

People are 100% better at games... you seeing derps isn‚Äôt people as a whole.  There will always be people who suck, but gaming as a whole as evolved and people are better whether you wanna believe it or not

Lol wut? Once you get his loyalty up (takes like two hours) then you only need 2 stacks of food to last hours and hours of playtime.

50/50 Alliance/Horde split, good community, world of warcraft realm
---
theres two healers that have tankspecs, no dds tho :P
---
I wish I could downvote you 50 more times. Alliance warlock here.
---
9% is yellow Hit cap. Singe alot of your damage is coming from white Hits as a rogue, you want to get as much Hit as possible. Unless you reach white hitcap. ( feel free to correct me if i'm wrong)
---
It‚Äôs in retail. 
---
Who really needs a keyring anyways? There‚Äôs only like two end dungeons that need a key anyways. It‚Äôs not THAT inconvenient.
---
Graveyard yes, Library no.
---
Also you will need to switch to def stance and apply sunder armor to hold aggro reliably.
---
That's a special level of entitled.
---
Let me help you. There is something called filters. Now there's a few ways you can use this, Upload date (this would bring the newest to the top/bottom depending how you chose) Or number of views. 
---
 Wow head has a classic site that works great. Information from 2006 is still relevant and helpful. Unless you're looking to rotation, bis, or build guides, all of which can be found within about 10 seconds or you can use icyveins, wowhead, so many other sources for this information.
---
which was amazing since it opened up more gearing options for said specs where they werent meme specs anymore. But yeh naxx gear is amazing and i dont like that people keep saying that tbc basically replaced gear straight away because they replaced some crappy MC gear early in tbc.
---
I **highly** recommend going Skinning and either Herbalism or Mining if you want to make money fast.
---
Then after you get an acceptable level of gold, swap out the Herb/Mining, but always keep Skinning; most of the mobs you quest on can be skinned.
---
Not crusader. The prof counts as a buff but not the enchant. Resist enchants also don‚Äôt count for some reason.
---
This is excellent and completely on brand for EE thank you
---
&gt;It really comes down to what YOU want to do and that‚Äôs the joy of the game. If you‚Äôre seriously getting upset over some dude that‚Äôs reserving items/mounts I‚Äôll say that you need to take a video game less seriously and enjoy it. They don‚Äôt affect you an ounce.
---
Lol, who the hell are you to decide how seriously someone take any part of this game?  You get to decide where that line in the sand gets drawn?  "Play the game how you want unless by my standard you're playing it too seriously then don't play it that way".  In the list of things in my life that I take seriously, WoW is towards the bottom, but it's still a hobby I put time and effort in to and I do take it seriously to a degree.  Otherwise what's the point?  95% of my reaction to that post is laughing, 5% flabbergasted head shaking.  I don't really give 2 shits about that LFG requirement, but I do care about someone having the balls to think announcing that reserve gives them any more right to that mount that anyone else.  It's doesn't.  Not that for that drop, ESPECIALLY not for that drop.
---
The world record for 0-60 is a longer playtime than many AAA games. Most players take about 200 hours to do it. I'm not sure about achievement, but it's certainly an accomplishment.
---
How do I make Mooncloth? I‚Äôve just got 250 tailoring on my 50 lock and I‚Äôm interested in making it. Cheers
---
I can guarantee it was only VC on post-launch servers because any server open at launch would have been DM=Deadmines first.
---
You can level an alt to disenchant and create pots. Leveling alch is also cheap. Get engineering or a tethering prof
---
What does proc mean ?
---
Cheers, yeah I should consider that. Makes sense as I've never vendored a green, my enchanting is maxed at 225 until I can get into Uldaman.
---
That wasn't the question though?
---
You gear you tanks first.
---
Good point and grats on the cake day
---
Did you farm it with 2 other rogues? I farmed it with another rogue (easy doable with only 2) and we both got our hoj in 70-80 runs
---
Wait there's a main section on things you search?
---
Healing power. Not health power. Sorry. You gain healing spell power from spirit by taking that talent in the holy tree.
---
The numbers are just from what I noticed while levelling. Whenever I exchanged int for spirit on my gear while levelling and dipped below those numbers I had a harder time.
---
There are two hit caps. Yellow hitcap which is for your abilities, and white hitcap which is for auto attacks.
---
The yellow hitcap for a rogue is 6% because you have 305 weapon skill by default with combat tree, and since you get 5% hit from talents you only need 1% hit from gear. However any hit above helps you do more dps with white attacks and is still quite valuable.
---
yeah, i was trying to get to the point of being able to kite, but i cant seem to survive the opener or be in a position where the rogue is not stealthed.  I need to get faster with the iceblock/cancel/frost nova I think. Then maybe fireball, Lvl1 Frost bolt, then reg frostbolt.
---
I have 30 spell power to weapon and charge 50-60g. Plenty of demand, few complaints and usually the ones complaining are too cheap to buy the mats for it anyway.
---
I think you misunderstood.  They were trying to *get* to Google so they could google your question.  It's a common issue with those who didn't grow up with this kind of technology.
---
/s in case it wasn't obvious
---
I would focus mainly on +Int and if you get +Int &amp; +Spi on an item, all the better. There is some +healing or +damage/healing around but I wouldn't go for it unless it drops in a dungeon or is a Q reward. Large mana pool means you can cast more heals and if your group knows what to do, the majority of your heals should be cost efficient Heal Rank X on the tank and almost 0 renew / shield / flash heals.
---
Well two things, the "hit cap" applies to your abilities or yellow damage when 9% comes into play.  A lot of Rogues damage in Classic is their white weapon damage and the hit cap for offhand damage is something crazy like in the 20s%.
---
So hit rating above 9% is likely to not be as highly weighted as other stats, but not entirely useless or a waste.  Part of the reason Pre-bis has all those items listed is because the list is only comparing the items to items of the same slot and not to all the equipment on your character.
---
X can be used to mark forbidden things, like [parking forbidden](https://www.4freephotos.com/medium/u2/Parking-prohibited-sign166.jpg) or [no fishing](https://www.girvin.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/symbolism-of-the-x_11.jpg)
---
I have read that some people have tried the hit cap out again and ended up with the solution that our hit cap actually is 6% (for yellow attack) cuz of the weapon expertis down in combat tree.
---
https://youtu.be/U8tJ1jU-m18 here you have a video explaining it. And he also talks about which other stats thats good to go for etc
---
Any idea what white hit cap is??
---
Imo doing anything but 1.12 tuning would have taken a lot of work figuring out the older balance amd creating it. Changing loot tables and gating patch content is really easy in comparison.
---
TIL
---
I'm planning to avoid the guild. I don't want that kind of thing to be the norm or to get kicked mid dungeon.
---
Please do. Lmao. No don't actually because no one cares
---
There are so many items with so many different statlines that getting a comprehensive list together would be asinine
---
Reserving a comment here for when the discussion will be blocked.
---
this. Players only focus on the negative. Okay, they are bad raid tank and mediocre dps (which isn't important right now considering people roll over MC and onyxia) but are at least good at everything else.
---
What pvp servers are alliance favored?
---
If you're somehow on the yojamba oceanic server I'm happy to send you what you need for your mount c:
---
Are you dedicating your whole life to posting the same link over and over again?
---
*grey
---
Oh yeah, it's not too bad while leveling, but the main value of spirit is mana regen.
---
TBC Shadow Priest is still my favorite experience playing WoW. So fun. So good.
---
Even then.
---
Use https://web.whatsapp.com/ when on your computer. Like a normal person.
---
Currently level 45.  I was fortunate, and frugal, enough to get my mount at 40 and I'm still am thinking about what class I want to roll next knowing it'll be another month at least until I reach 60.
---
Skolo. Mance.
---
If the item is for 7g on the AH, then the mats can't be worth a lot so asking a random should be np.
---
You are actually gimping yourself threefold:  you are losing gold and time by doing it the way you do. You bath in frustration because things don't go the way you'd like them to be. You could be miles ahead, completed the quest, and actually made gold by now. Just ask a random or buy them off the AH.
---
Ya, I didn't play a warrior until TBC. I just started mine as an alt and noticed Tclap was Battle only.
---
As for threat. I'm pretty sure Demo shout and Battle Shout both generate some threat being that one is a debuff and another one is a buff (Paladins are apparently pulling threat spamming Greater Blessings in raids).
---
It matters because the neckbeards on this sub like to cry and whine about everything. Only thing I've been able to come up with after a year of seeing this argument. It's kinda sad and pathetic to care about it this much. But just go type "lfg vc" in trade chat and you'll trigger a bunch of them.
---
Who cares? Death to Blizzard!!!
---
On my server in 2005 it was DM, but on every private server I played on half the people called it VC and would argue to the grave about it.
---
Right okay so from what I understand from your guys comments it is still beneficial to have above the 9% hit cap as - for white hits , which is majority of rogue damage
---
As a priest that‚Äôs what I would do. Find a group of mages/locks and just aoe grind instances. Once you start running Scarlet Monastery you will be getting alto of xp/hr. Run that until 43-44 then start running ZF gy runs. 
---
If you get bored then just go quest for a little to break it up
---
I specifically said it wasn't a big deal, but it's rude. The trip to SM from alliance side isn't all that fun either. You understand wanting to complain, right?
---
They released it earlier exactly so that it would be relevant. Most people probably aren't 60 yet.
---
it doesnt change the calculations tho, its just visual, it just means the npc is classed as a boss, level does not change
---
Uhhh what? Most of the item drops from ZG are turned in at the island.
---
This is just the pre-ZG version that doesn't have houses and NPC's. yet.
---
I currently have 4 toons in the low 40's. Idk....it's just a point in the leveling process where everything slows down for me.
---
Honestly, i kind of liked it.
---
The running around was a pain in the ass, and trying to hunt down rexxar. Had a couple of mages in the group for the dragons though so we just planned shit out ahead of time and ported accordingly.
---
So once I realized Enchanting was making me really poor, I got the vendor price add on and anything over a certain value I sold, and anything below that I DE-ed. Like when I was in the 30s (or maybe earlier?), I set the bar at 20silver. Anything less than 20 silver I DE-ed and anything higher I sold.  After I got my mount, I moved that marker to like 80s, then 1g, etc.  (note that I borrowed heavily for my mount, but if I didn't I would have been able to afford the mount around 44 like someone else above.)
---
I found that guideline so far has helped me maintain a good balance of enchanting material and gold.
---
He‚Äôs wrong. He didn‚Äôt read. 45-60 is half of the xp from 1-60. It takes a very long time compared to 1-45.
---
And that's why I KOS priests that get on that boat lmao
---
That laugh at the end.. It hurts
---
Shh
---
all dagger rogues in his raid, should of put more context my bad.
---
They don't offer a server for that.  I recommend quitting the game.
---
All the PVPs or none of the PVPs.
---
Scholo, DM, and BRD all use keys. Strat needs two.

Yeah, I'm really starting to hate WoW Classic. It's nearly impossible to solo level and do quests because mob aggro range is just too much. It's ridiculous when they run away and call for help, you've already burnt through all your mana and are nearly dead only for 2-5 more mobs to come charging at you and you know you're dead. Then you either have to walk all the way, respawn in the same location and risk dying again or just take resurrection sickness and do nothing for 10 minutes. This game is too tilting and grindy, I don't like it and can't wait for TBC and WoTLK, which made single-player leveling much more streamlined yet still challenging. 
---
Another aspect of this that makes solo leveling harder is the stupid hit percentages. I can't even being to describe my frustration when I'm fighting mobs I know I can kill (at my level or below) just to have miss,dodge, parry about 4-5 times in a row. 
---
These issues compounded make the game way too frustrating to enjoy, personally. I might unsubscribe and wait for the first expansion re-release.
---
First thing to decide is your region: US West? US East? Aussie? EU?
---
Have you ever tried mouseover macros? They might change your life. 
---
Particularly awesome for interrupts and taunt, but also let you keep your auto attack pumping into the primary target if you want. Can also sunder up a sheeped target which always amuses me more than it should.
---
Macro question for Nifty Stopwatch.
---
I  just got my Nifty Stopwatch and want to make a macro that will use the trinket and if the trinket is on a cool down then it would use a swiftness potion instead.
---
I am not the best with macros and couldn‚Äôt find anything online for what I am looking for.
---
I think they should put flying mounts on a 5 minute cool down and a 1 minute Mac usability. Then at the end of the timer it turns into a glider.
---
Might be too early for this, but how are each class doing DPS wise for MC/Ony? Is it exactly as expected per Vanilla standards or is the pack more evened out than originally thought?
---
Archeage unchained is coming out so they releasing DM in hope to get people from being bored in classic and moving on. I doubt key ring is more important to them than that.
---
Pretty much a level 5 of every class üòÑ
---
nope its always worked like this
---
Scholomance key, 2 stratholme keys, dire maul key, BRD key. Idk if relic coffer keys go into keyring as well.
---
I think scholo was actually 285.  I was able to lockpick scholo and then we went to the backdoor and I couldn't.
---
Not a conspiracy. Players are getting content earlier. Players will clear said content. Players will get bored.
---
I'll repeat myself: I don't understand how people aren't seeing this; content now, means less content later (because you've farmed that 'early access' content already).
---
https://www.pcgamer.com/wow-classics-next-phase-will-launch-later-this-year/
---
&gt; The key ring wasn't added until parch 1.11 so the majority of Vanilla was played without it.
---
And classic wow is based on 1.12 so it should have dropped with it.
---
You can purge ras frostwhisper to remove the annoying melee aura.
---
Cry baby. Look at all your replies in this post lmao
---
lok tar
---
I got a free mount on my Warlock though! 
---
46 Warlock, 30 Shaman, 22 Druid, bunch of others in the teens...
---
So that explains why no one on my server has Bizznicks yet..
---
Nope. Can't.
---
This, shield severely stunts rage gen for bears and warriors. Paladins don't have that issue
---
Level 60 character with a 300 Weapon Skill:
---
    Level 60 mob: 5.0% / dual-wield: 24%
---
    Level 61 mob: 5.5% / dual-wield: 24.5%
---
    Level 62 mob: 6.0% / dual-wield: 25%
---
    Level 63 mob: 9.0% / dual-wield: 28%
---
if you are a Level 60 character with a Weapon Skill of 300, you need +9% chance to hit to never miss a shot against a Level 63 boss (or skull mob).
---
Orcs have stun resist. Tauren have stomp. Undead have wotf.
---
Wouldn't buy anything except Devilsaur if you can't craft it
---
but **why** when there is no need to ?

you can read up everything you need to know about anything in the game, by just stopping by the comment sections of wowhead.

elemental earth has good value but its been dropping on my server at least

Jesus I am inefficent... I have no job, I have played since day 1 and have a 55 holy priest 13 and a half days played, 10 shammy 12 hours played, 20 warrior 2 days played and 6 mage/rogue with an hour each, and a lvl 5 I made second day that has 5hours played
---
Huh, there's plenty of BIS gear *in* diremaul.
---
LFG is poppin on my server all the time, only way I find groups
---
Nope [ask.com](https://ask.com) (previously ask jeeves) works very similar to google. I've been telling people for years, knowing how to use a search engine is crucial. Doesn't matter which engine I use I will find the answer I need relatively quickly.
---
One up it and go Hemo in PvE - then you really stand out
---
Will of the Forsaken, Orc stun resist. On top of horde looking like the more rugged more murdery type.

Oh I have. Sure, something triggered all of this. Dosen't mean their decision is a good one.
---
Short for ‚Äúprogrammed random occurrence‚Äù when an item/talent that has a ‚Äúchance‚Äù to do something does that thing, it Proc‚Äôd.
---
&gt; The #nochanges argument is over. You can't use #nochanges to justfiy everything that isn't changed when there are a bunch of changes elsewhere.
---
This is my take on it.  They harp on no changes and then change tons of shit.
---
I have **far** more responsibilities now than I did back then and have achieved far more in the past 2 months than I did in several years of playing Classic(not counting pvp achievements) - I was a fucking scrub apparently.
---
What should be my pre raiding checklist when I hit 60? (Excluding being decently geared)
---
I have quit the game. That doesn't mean I can't critique it.
---
Nice non-arguement though?
---
Dire Maul didn't come out until a few months into Vanilla, so the players from launch always called Deadmines as DM. VC became adopted after time on some servers and everyone acts like their history is the way Classic should be.
---
Give it up for Duke blueberry ladies and gentlemen
---
I'm a shaman gearing up to raid soon and will respec resto but I still want to gank lvl 1's in the eastern kingdoms. Will a resto spec with ele gear still be good enough in PVP?
---
Such a good feeling when someone would skull for you and you could make it back to the bank.
---
Simple, I love it. Cheers! :)
---
Any fellow enhancement shamans with some input as to where exactly I'm supposed to stand during the rag fight? Obviously I can't stand close to the melee, do I just do no DPS and spot heal the entire fight?
---
People used to make up all kinds of dumb shit acronyms for stuff in WoW, that doesn't make any of them valid. Cherry picking examples also doesn't really add anything to the argument since you also can't prove that on given people's servers that they never saw "VC" since I played through early-mid vanilla all the way to the end of WotLK on Eredar and never once saw VC used
---
100% this! I've died more times in Hellsbrad alone than everywhere else combined. It was a nightmare and I still hate that place with a passion!
---
Spent a few hours there yesterday (again). I‚Äôve ran this place so much and haven‚Äôt even seen them drop - let alone lose the roll on them.
---
Yesterday we had a warlock who kept lifetapping because he forget to bring water (and food, apparently) to lbrs
---
as a rogue i never carry around the keys
---
laughs in bag space
---
Yeah as much as I love my hunter, it is incredibly clunky to play at the moment. The feign and trap issue is so irritating.
---
I levelled as [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fhebotzZhZxMe0cGRo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fhebotzZhZxMe0cGRo) and didn't swap until I picked up my first weapon from raids.
---
I‚Äôm a level 40 rogue alliance and I feel like I‚Äôm using under leveled swords. My primary is a electroocutioner leg and secondary is Cruel Barb. Are these holding me back rn? If so, where can I grind for better swords? I just picked up a nice dagger from doing SM Lib and Cath so maybe I‚Äôll use that in my offhand.
---
If that's really your schedule then you're super inefficient. New to WoW, probably less than half your pensum, 47/25/21. I did start following a general route when my main hit 30, but with my own dungeons and exploration mixed in. I find that having a route as reference helps me to plan 1-2 levels ahead, where to go next dungeon wise and so on. This speeds things up tremendously while still letting you explore on your own.
---
They've got bigger things to worry about, like censoring free speech and licking China's butthole.
---
Shined blind
---
I farmed for mine and I found that the greater earth elementals in badlands didn't have much competition while the lesser and regular ones were instantly killed
---
What lap top is that?
---
Yep, it‚Äôs perfect
---
Wait are you serious?
---
retarded guild for sure
---
Realize it‚Äôs just a digital item in digital world. It‚Äôs not real nor does it matter. Congrats on the cool sword. Just work on getting your money up in real life!
---
That, uh, doesn't actually mention keyrings at all. What's your point?
---
Sad that this wasn't fixed or noticed, but to be expected from 2019 Blizz.  
---
It's too late to fix this at this point, you'd just be fucking over the people hitting 60 now.
---
Same here!  Have a 60 Warrior with an epic mount, but pretty sadly undergeared because I'm just rotating through my Hunter/Rogue/Shaman/Warlock alts now.
---
MC is easy due to mechanics, I'm saying we killed stuff faster than people three tiers above us in gear levels did back in the day, on a boss that is simply spank and tank. The gear Axemen had is miles better than our pre bis, which is what makes me think. I'm not surprised MC is easy, I'm surprised at how fast everything dies.
---
yea but that drop in instance so...
---
Impractical to target the X after skull huh? Sounds like dps logic
---
same here, funny it was such a struggle.  Now the 900g struggle is on.
---
It's already so difficult finding dungeons at 60 as a DPS. I see groups in the LFG channel spamming LF1M tank for hours and hours...
---
And the few that enjoy it have to roll against dps for tanking gear.
---
Reddit experts are always first to correct. If she enjoys a particular position or keyboard turning let her - as long as she has fun.
---
I bet you curse at the air for not being a pineapple.
---
Ally cry about it just as much. It's a fucking meme, move on.
---
guild or pug raid?
---
I did the opposite. I powered to 60, bought my epic and started farming a ton of ore and herbs to sell. once my gold was good, I started alts and used the gold to twink them. my warrior is approaching level 35, and it's been an absolute blast having nice items in each slot and my weapon upgraded every 5-8 levels.
---
Are you one of those Medell√≠n guys promoting that this is a BiS for mages?
---
Ally tend to be just as vocal.
---
Holy shit dude...4 days later and you are still...
---
Fuck off LOL
---
Depend, the edgemasters are better gloves so maybe those pants are worth replacing the devilsaur
---
It's cute that you think every raid is going to have one =P
---
Why would anyone call VC DM?
---
No, he's in a pvp realm.
---
This is how it is:
---
If you get a rogue out of stealth, which essentially comes down to luck. The rogue is at a HUGE disadvantage. Almost guaranteed loss unless he blows all his cooldowns in what will be a bo3
---
If you let the rogue open, hes not guaranteed to win. The duel plays out fairly and anything can happen.
---
Its beyond me that you can cry about these things
---
Why do you hate playing him? I'm leveling my priest and I'm not looking forward to hating him when I finally reach 60.
---
... Not liking wow classic makes me delusional?
---
LOL, you seem like a reasonable fellow yourself bud
---
I was on my way to badlands through wetlands as an undead warlock. I saw a gnome warlock about 7 levels under me heading the opposite direction on the road. I got off to the side of the road and kept going just to show I wasnt a threat, I just wanted to get to my destination. 
---
The little fucker charges me and starts casting a shadow bolt. So I dot him up since I'm affliction and the fucker realizes his mistake tries to run. I dont let him get away though because fuck him, he attacked me.
---
I swear, the alliance players really have some kind of chip on their shoulder to prove they can pvp or something
---
i like browsing, buying and selling on AH, plus I spend a lot of time AFK alt-tabbed on reddit and twitch.
---
Razorfen Downs quest gives Vanquisher Sword, and Maraudon quest gives Thrash Blade. Those two swords will last you to 60 easily.
---
Sounds like mommy and daddy cba to give you attention so they just give you money instead
---
Can you imagine being over thirty years old and having this delusional thought process? This guy walks among you on this world, it's fascinating.

hate to be the bearer of bad news. You should read someone of your comments back. You can't catch flies with vinegar.
---
Ah okay, I'm at 6.5 ish on my 42 so maybe I'm not doing too bad. Very little idle time though, only in the early couple of days when I wanted to avoid queues while having dinner etc.
---
Are you, me?
---
I have a 43 main. And have made 2 alts and got them to level 10 since then.
---
Guild registry has no server list??
---
You didn't want our opinions you want us to support you being mad over the decision.
---
Fact of the matter is its good on tanks and if your raid is full of dagger rogues then you have bigger problems than loot.
---
Has anyone done the quest for the Shadoweave Mask? I noticed you need to be 44 to equip it but I've read you can't pick the quest up until 45. Is this true?
---
Lucky. Warriors have to auto attack but we can't tan to reddit or else we die.

They never intended to win any level 60 world firsts. The leveling race we are talking about here is between the guilds downing Rag. You get world first Rag by leveling up your guild the fastest. 
---
I‚Äôm sorry but how are you not able to differentiate between the two in this conversation?
---
They‚Äôre adding expansions to classic? If they do this they better have specified realms labeled as progression and keep our classic in tact.
---
WW are is nowhere close to the sword. Just  compare the base damage. That sword is stupid good. I'm level 47 now, and  I still might go back a time or two to get it so that I can respect swords. I'm also human, so that's extra incentive. th next best swords come 55+.

Sword spec is also objectively better  than axes, there just happen to be a lot more good axes.

I always believe that people who use the abbreviation VC designate that they have the skill and competencies to clear the instance. Where people who use the DM abbreviation for DeadMines normally wipe inside the instance multiple times.  Ppl do the same thing for UD strat. Back in the day that was called BR. When I zone into DM for the first time tuesday I know I'm already doing different bosses in different sections. So the whole north, east, west, directional thing won't make sense. It will be a Dire Maul run but only clearing parts of east,west,north. People use the DM abbreviation for when u hit parts of multiple sections. It gets annoying when u say LFM DM and u gather a group together to find out tht outside the dungeon in feralas that the healer is a lvl 14 priest when you thought you had a full group.
---
my alt druid (40) is going to get the epic mount first I think due to professions (mining/herb)
---
Yeah the day 1 hot fix is what they meant by "first patch". That's why it's already in the game. What else could they mean by first patch other than p2?
---
not tested:
---
/cast [mod] [@mouseover, harm] [] Polymorph
---
Funny, I main a pally but I level my hunter alt whenever I get bored or to clear out his rested experience, currently he's at level 16. It feels like a completely different game, hunter is ultra mega easy mode compared to the pally it's such a breath of fresh air to just completely wreck everything I see before it even hits me. I do have him stacked with a full set of greens though so it may be a little easier than for your average hunter if it's not an alt, and I'm sure a pally with a full set of greens won't be quite as bad as when it's your first character.
---
Its really not if you want to get epic mount and get mats and consumables ready for raid. An epic mount nearly costs like 1600g with runecloth turn ins. You make way less gold than literally all other classes/specs in the game. Thats cool if you're fine with being poor. Don't try to shit on others though for wanting some gold for their efforts. Same as people charging for ring runs or enchantments
---
&gt;What server are you on, I spent a couple hours MC ing people into Lava and off Boats on my undead priest yesterday, are you salty because I got you?
---
Noggenfogger.
---
I haven't been MCed by any priests, leveling together with a Friend, so that doesn't work as well for the priest. 
---
Noticed that the attacking horde were all undead priests lately (high 40s low 50s). There were a couple who attacked (all undead priests), but since there are 2 of us, they mostly attacked once if they came across us when fighting multiple mobs, and then left to prevent retaliation. The infuriating one was the lvl ?? attacking during the escort quest in Searing Gorge. Made more infuriating since the quest is Alliance only, so he gained nothing from interrupting it. Other classes were less inclined to fight (most people seem to focus on reaching 60 once they get up into the 50s, but for some reason, the undead priests feel they have to fight as long as they have an advantage).
---
Although priests like you don't speak against the kill on sight policy either :D
---
Mostly the post was to make the joke about shadowform corrupting the horde priests.
---
It's actually more enjoyable someone like you hates my joke lol
---
I have a better way. Wait for horde to kill it, Sap, skin, profit, /thank, Vanish, profit.
---
Yup, had to abandon Rak'Shiri in order to catch a bloodaxe worg which had the last skills i needed. Rip dear friend.
---
As a warrior tank I ask the group if I can get the holy waters for those aoe packs. Shoot, los, holy water. Helps a ton.
---
&gt;They can hit further without being hit themselves.  
---
Chiming in to say this is bullshit. It works both ways. If a tauren can hit you, you can hit them.
---
Well for one, although not a racial, paladins for raids. Mighty advantage right there. Add the other stuff like...
---
+5 swords for humans (tanks)
---
Fear ward (dwarf priests)
---
+5% spirit for humans
---
But in the end, I think paladins and priest unique spells are the reasons.
---
&gt; Why would anyone keep playing retail?
---
Retail has strengths going for it as well.  The raid experience in retail is very finely tuned.  Raids fights are tested for different sizes and compositions.  Class balance is typically better than classic.  Managing a guild is easier in many ways in retail between guild banks, calendars, and etc.
---
Classic forces players to form more of a community.  The game is both more simple and more complex in some ways.  The pace of the game is generally much slower than retail.  Classes are less balanced but also less homogenized.  Despite the game world being much smaller than that which is available in retail it tends to feel larger due to lack of fast travel options and lack of flying mounts.  The talent tree in classic means players have more meaningful control over how their character performs.
---
There are good reasons why people could prefer either choice.
---
Yep, which is what was breaking characters so badly and making people with hit cap still miss. When nearly every piece of your gear has 1 or more +SP/Crit/Hit, you quickly pass the buff limit.
---
Human has sword and mace specialisation reducing the hit cap required from gear by 3% (though this is good for PVP too)
---
Growing up through the Barrens does something to the Horde. They come out...different.
---
"goldfish memory"
---
Goldfish have a memory of over a year you realize right? Fucking troglodyte lmao. 
---
You should also actually read what's being discussed by a person before responding since this post makes absolutely no sense, and also wondering why the fuck you posted the definition of concise when I used it correctly since if additional information is required to articulate the point clearly then it's still "concise" lmao
---
Hand of Justice after like 2 or 3 weeks at 60...still the fucking hand of Justice.  At least with Dire Maul I can finally get another trinket.
---
too bad that 99% of your peers will kill all they see. gotta stop undead  rogues while lvling.
---
Go shadow
---
I seem to have the same issue. Been disconnected from Ashbringer three times today.
---
It's so rare and pricey it could be anywhere from 500gto 10k really. Ask around in wolrd chat and stuff and gauge the interest.
---
ALOT, atleast over 1k gold.
---
A mage who iceblocks works too IIRC.
---
I considered that but honestly it's still nice and I had the excess gold.
---
sems like a really bad raid comp or really misinformed rogues
---
We used to be the guild that the "High End Raiding" Guilds would essentially recruit out of.  We had so many dwarf priests pass through our halls, loot purples and move on.  
---
Was never in it for the loot. Was in for the people.  15 years later, still playing with some of those people now. 
---
And you're right about lifelong friends you can make. They came to my wedding. : )
---
You certainly are taking it seriously when you shouldn‚Äôt
---
Single target frost i can still get into most if not all spellcleave groups in SM so far
---
I never had problems till I saw the population of real s changed to "layered" and now it's all funky
---
If I had a gold for every time I got killed in Hillsbrad by 3 or 4 Alliance on my Shaman, I'd have enough money for a mount by level 30. I dont mind 1v1 and maybe a friend jumps in to help because they dont wanna lose the fight but 4v1 and they're all ?? level to me.....wow. Just wow.
---
I am going to pull my vanity pets out before flight just to mess with people
---
As others have said, just need practice and when BG's come out that will help.  I am very rusty at wpvp as well.  It's also possible he was just better geared and if he blew you up, probably a dagger spec (typically sword combat is the level spec and can't backstab with swords - so not as much burst).
---
Blink immediately and sheep to reset.  Open with fireball and frost bolt.  Know your frost nova range and hit that when they are close.  They will probably use sprint so just do your best to keep range.  Iceblock their kidney stun, they will probably try to vanish if fireball is off.  Be ready to cancel iceblock and try to get them out of stealth.  Reset iceblock with cold snap and if they open on you iceblock.  Blink if up / nova / etc.  The goal is to kite them.  Rogues are coolddown dependent as much or if not more than mages.
---
I didnt know you could use this on other players, fuck yeaaaa I'm going to have a good time tonight.
---
Ignore list that fucker.
---
It is, by design. Patch 1.12 itemization is absolutely dumb. Most blues are better than gear from MC/Ony (with few notable exceptions). 
---
As a Priest I wear 3x T1 pieces (bracers, boots &amp; belt) only for the set bonus. If I would skip it, I could get better +healing through greens/blues.
---
58 rogue, work 6 10hr shifts and have a wife that doesn't understand so I only play on nights she's working.
---
I prefer leveling as fire. It feels a lot more AFK like leveling my hunter was. With frost it felt like I'm kiting mobs constantly which got tedious
---
&gt; Can we play 
---
How about YOU play the way YOU want, and WE play however WE like ?
---
After you dole out loot everyone drops group then you loot.
---
For sure, I‚Äôve just been hustling the AH and offering lockpicking services. Was seeing if I missing out on anything with the pickpocket runs
---
Why do newer players get butthurt that it‚Äôs called VC?
---
The agil ench isn't even in the game till phase 5 soooo..
---
Skipped the mask, figured I'd much rather have dreamweave. Though for warlocks I suppose this would be a good option, too.
---
Yup i bought it at 44, JUST before 45
---
Do you need me to call you an ambulance? It must've taken a stroke to go from what I said to that.
---
I actually got a priest to 59, could never get a dungeon group (because most groups are indeed looking for a tank or dps) and hated trying to do *anything* in the world as Holy spec.
---
What the hell is Deadmines? Do you mean Cookie's Cove?
---
hot take
---
Imo, the only one that matters is the white stallion.  It was in the game at launch and later removed for more ‚Äúepic‚Äù looking horses.  Classic players should have had a chance to get this mount before the equivalent patch phase that it was originally removed.
---
Back in vanilla I played 4 warlocks to lvl 10 because I wanted better names for my blueberry.
---
looks nice
---
everything.
---
It can't proc off anything that DOESN'T deal damage, so your PS, VE and mind soothe won't be procing it. If they are, it's a bug.
---
The aspect of online gaming you're looking for doesn't exist here.  It never did.
---
That makes you a troll in this subreddit.
---
Are you like a people scientist?
---
I‚Äôve had some runs where only two dropped all night, sounds like you just got lucky
---
No we had our guild made before release and we recruited on the Mirage raceway discord before release and on the EU forums. We only invite those who ask for one.
---
Ha! Ha!   That's better then killing him.
---
And let's name the 2nd child starscream
---
Oh yeah I forgot to mention lockpicking.  Sometimes that can be really effective.  Sometimes people will tip insane amounts.  Other times like last night I opened 6 boxes and got a 10s tip lol.
---
Dragonkin Menace Quest in Searing Gorge
---
I think you're either having trouble keeping up or you're the type of person that brought us BFA and War Mode.
---
Depending on when they started in 2006 they may not have even hit level cap by the time BC came out (January 2007)
---
Why would you level with sword and shield. Two hand, fury spec, at 20 I dual wielded, but there was plenty of times I missed a ton and got frustrated. 2h fury is great all the way to 60 though.
---
Look if you can get someone to tank for you and all they do is reserve the mount, that's a pretty good deal. Because it's effectively reserving nothing
---
Sometimes they do. They usually get one chance to control their aggro. If they fail, they get salv again. Usually I just ignore their request and they land up happy with salv because the dungeon pace is really fast.
---
Most quest greens will sell to a vendor for like 2g at that point. And regular grays that drop off NPCs are valuable to vendors. Not to mention throwing things like Runecloth on the AH.
---
its not fucking stupid when the target has a giant fucking skull on it and is the only caster in the group.
---
Im going for gassps
---
You can do this, but i dont Think you would benefit well from it. Just doing two swords or whatever will serve you better
---
It got fixed multiple times but by the end started having a 100% success rate - within reason. Meaning not near someone else when vanishing and don't have any debuffs and not in any range of and untargeted aoe.
---
Sucks for whoever put in the work. I doubt it even gets users barely.
---
I should learn Lua and make an add-on for Classic that alerts you when someone who ganks lowbies is in the zone. For lowbies to be alert and for those of equivalent level to camp them.
---
As in, I don't think people came up with the name unassisted, they definitely took the cue from ST in the log
---
For pvp as safe as flying made it for you it also was more dangerous. Just as easily as you could fly up and away I could swoop down and attack. 
---
Also world pvp is killed by bgs not flying mounts. Dont fall for propaganda. Wpvp in any significant scale ended with the release of wsg and AV. In fact tbc did a good job to bring some wpvp back with random world objectives.
---
Also you had to be 70 to fly anyway so while leveling it was still dangerous.
---
Jhaz thang, you make my heart sing
---
They may have existed but not everyone knew to look up the lists. I was a rogue that had no idea what Bis even meant. I ended up with dal rends because I liked combat spec, but also wore full shadowcraft I thought sets were automatically better than not having a set
---
Surprised since golem drops good healer loot
---
It's also approximately the same amount of time from the first rag kill in the US to when DM was released.  So it's really not too far off schedule, IMO.  Personally, in vanilla DM was out before I even hit 60 because I spent so much time rerolling and adventuring with friends so DM being out isn't really a huge game changer for most people as compared to vanilla.
---
Not with improved ghost wolf talent, like I mentioned above
---
I had a group insist that the 26 shaman was strong enough to heal Sm gy and I was dying because I was pulling too much. I don't think they understood that mobs can't be seperated.
---
That'd be great if 2 things were true.  If feline swiftness had any value as a resto druid and if the point wasn't needed in resto to get to swiftmend.  The point in motw has to go into one of those talents the point you'd give up for the useless swiftness talent is from later in the tree.
---
Yeah I meant to say instant not deadly.
---
Which cast bars do you want to keep? There's luna cast bars, which are configured for each frame type and appear as the bottom row of your frame; there's ClassicCastBars which adds a default styled cast bar near your frame; and you can use the cast bar from Dominos, which I like the most since it's a nice large bar in the middle of your screen.
---
You‚Äôre an idiot. These two things are completely different. The leveling race between the two guilds they intended to win, to be the first lvl 60 in the world, they did not.
---
NO PET
---
I just might have to do that.
---
thats luck
---
Actually you helped, searching related to classic addon found it:

Boycott ~~Blizzard~~ China lost steam?

Lots of caster gear coming out with Dire Maul
---
Lots of non-workers, too.
---
Anyone who uses the slang ‚Äútrash‚Äù to refer to other players is someone you can safely ignore.
---
Alright, thanks. I have always liked the sword and shield combo and I was kinda hoping for extra survivability. I guess the "you'll survive better if you kill it first" still takes precedence.
---
How bad is it with 2 1hs, really?
---
B L I Z Z L I K E
---
90% of those warriors are trying to DPS. So if you want to tank that‚Äôs a good choice. Groups are always looking for tanks.
---
Nobody is ever going to leave keys in the bank on the off chance that the rogue actually has his lockpicking leveled up AND isn't going to leave at any point during the run when a key is needed or if a wipe happens.
---
I think that's a point in the grind when you're really just feeling like something fresh. Have a 45 warlock and just started a rogue. Going to let that bonus exp build up a bit and swap back a forth between the two.
---
Did anybody else just spend so much time in Ironforge not really doing anything...?
---
It is easy just AoE farm BRD/ZF. 20-25 elites at once and 75g+ per hour minimum
---
Sit on ele fire, it picks up again. They were below 1g at a point on our server, now they are in the 3-5g range
---
This has me curious on leveling an alt Tank. I have a 29 priest main now and i'm trying to catch a friend who is like 37 i think. I also would like to level an alt but afraid to lose time to my friend and get further behind. If i could just get a warrior to lvl 14 and park him in ORG to burn rested in RFC until i an run WC and then do the same that wouldn't be too bad. Do you not quest at all then? is there enough gear to keep you good for the dungeons?
---
thanks
---
What are battlestations?
---
Innervate being baseline is the best part about starting at 1.12
---
Yep, you're on a good way. I mixed up the threads, thought you were lvl 52 :)
---
And like the other reply here said. No not actively spending gold, but you are missing out on selling the leather.
---
When you hit 260 and start farming with the wicked leather bracers you need to buy a rune thread and black dye for 45s + 10s. You can't sell the bracers on the AH on my server for a profit. So you get 73cent from the vendor. Means you earn 18s.
---
The rugged leather you need is vendors for 8x 5s = 40s. And you could AH it for more. 
---
== you make a net loss leveling LW
---
I told myself I'll make up for it by selling Devilsaur armor later, but now I'd rather enjoy the game then farming the leather
---
I'm with you that they probably meant phase 2, but it is a bit misleading when they called it the first patch.
---
Always pickpocket any humanoids I come across. I mean it's a few silver here and there but it adds up, and greys. Also, I never have to buy food because they often have food. I many times they have health pots so I don't have to buy those much at all. Big bonus is I get poison mats. I also get flash powder and blinding powder. I never have to buy either one (fadeleaf for blinding.) Sometimes there's Star Ruby or other gem too. A few times I got a pattern, BS which I couldn't use. LOL 
---
So I say, if you are already stealthed, why not grab a little extra from a humanoid mob.
---
How do I enable guild names on other players? I combed through settings and can't figure it out.
---
You can get most of your pre-BiS from BRD, UBRS and Stratholme. Also some stuff in LBRS and Scholo (Robes of the Void). Also, check AH if there's any green +Shadow Damage gear, even if it's not Masters, it's often within +2-4 damage. Check the Wowhead list more more information
---
World buffs give an absurd power spike, good guilds have the coordination and skill to chain pu√∂l/grab multiple packs and still not die and lose world buffs, that way they clear the raid much faster, your 2 1/2 hour raid might be 45 minutes for them
---
World buffs get exponentially more worthwhile the longer you can maintain them, and so the ones getting the most value are the best guilds have minimum to no deaths
---
My warlock friend was doing horribly with gold. I kept trying to tell him to not spend gold and to save and he was almost 60 with less than 100g. Edgemasters dropped for him last night üòÇüòÇ
---
Guess I‚Äôm helping him with Deadsteed tomorrow
---
Hopefully she likes it!! Make an alt so y‚Äôall can play together
---
Paladin has got to be the easiest leveling and dungeoning I have ever experienced. I can watch sports all night, get 2-3 levels depending on how many dungeons I run, and healing involves 2-3 buttons outside of buffs. 
---
When I actually have to level I just grind mobs and watch TV. 
---
If I want to wear plate and see huge damage numbers, I can. If I want to heal, I throw on my cloth set and run a dungeon.
---
Worse pathing though so there's that.

Roll a mage, nothing quite like the feeling of arcane explosioning packs of lowbies.

Your pet dies in pretty much every pull in MC.  It takes a lot of food.

I rolled on a pvp server, got to level 43, didn't like how I couldn't enter a questing zone without getting ganked every 30 seconds. I rolled a pve server instead because I enjoy the pve aspect and the pvp on an even playing field. A level 27 meeting a level 29 in the open world could lead to a legitimately good fight, but let me ask you, like, honestly, do you genuinely find it fun getting sat on by a level 60 rogue escorting his low level buddy questing for 20 minutes right after you get home from work?
---
You don't. You ded. That boi just tryin' to justify some toxic shit.  
---
What about people who just want to do the mindless quests to take a load off and do something simple to relax and maybe feel a little accomplishment?
---
Dear Diary,  
---
After my twelve hour work day, I relaxed by repeatedly getting killed by some dick trolling while I tried to do slightly fulfilling quests to relax.
---
The pain? lol, this has got to be the easiest, most fire and forget leveling I‚Äôve ever experienced.
---
Depends on the way you play. If you consistently do green quests and farm green mobs 2 1hs is just as good. The problems start when you are playing with mobs around your level but that's not efficient even with a 2-hander.
---
The first one 90618 was day you posted your first vid for the series in june of last year, and im guessing the 110205 was when you first started playing wow?
---
It does kind of make sense that earth elementals are lightning resistant, though.  They're grounded :-p
---
Orc warlock and undead rogue? Tauren shaman and undead rogue? Or orc shaman and undead rogue?
---
There's a certain Dwarf paladin I've run into over and over again, randomly, for about 30 levels. It really is like seeing an old friend again.
---
you lucky b.... gratz :)
---
yea I should have mentioned that the target was a skull and the only healer in a group of adds I pulled in ZF. Besides I am a druid so I don't really have to do a tab-maul at lower levels when usually swipe is enough to hold aggro and you can pick up any runners with taunt.
---
The reality of the story was that hunter claimed to be attacking skull while clearly he was not... All I did was to ask him to please focus it and he got butt hurt and left
---
Personally I treat my UI like my bedroom and work around the mess I have made the best I can.
---
I think you're the kind of person that resorts to personal attacks when people point out they are talking shit.
---
Ok I totally missed that part and skipped to the graph, lol. My bad. Nice shit man.
---
The intended way is staying out of its "transform you into demon and die" range. So, kiting is the way.
---
Exploring an unopened AQ was one of my favorite memories of old WoW.  We figured out you could get into it with some clever cliff jumping and just went all over the place trying to picture how it would be when it was opened.  Then I quit not long after the opening event so never got to see it live.  (please, PLEASE blizgod have your servers prepared for that).
---
Fix a problem by creating a bigger problem.
---
I've done a grand total of 4 dungeon runs so far, that might be where I've gone wrong. 2x SM lib, arm and cath.
---
Best cleave is defo 3 frost mages 1 lock 1 priest for cath
---
Is this really the case or just a troll? I‚Äôve never done a raid before and want to know how much Fire resist I should shoot for if I were to become an off tank for MC/Ony.
---
Tanks were good before SM now they all wear 2h and yesterday one was even fury specced and he said he didn't want to waste money on a respec.. I useally only one or 2 dungs before changing char so it would be way too bothersome to find a mage each time. I guess low tier water could fix it though.
---
Then why aren't people calling RFC TH (taragaman the hungerer)? That quest is even lower level and right outside the instance.
---
Where do you want to see them? I had the same problem for a while until I realized that nameplates hide them. If you disable friendly nameplates you will see guild names.
---
Tooltips don't show guilds so you'd have to get customized tips for that.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=295171/wow-classic-hotfix-for-buffs-falling-off-before-cap-and-aura-problems
---
You're right that the hit issue is related to sets and overlapping benefits with gear. If you equip gear with +2% hit and then the devilsaur, the devilsaur set does not go into effect.
---
Raw gear benefits are passive auras while enchants are helpful auras. There has been no post stating that resistance enchants do not count as helpful and the crusader proc is absolutely considered one.
---
i suppose they will pick up aain when many people will be HL and too lazy to farm grey mobs to farm it ?
---
I agree with ya there. If I don't wanna hop on my main then I'm happy to wait it out, or conversely take the res sickness hit and go do something else :)
---
Nice! Wish I had that patience. I get annoyed with things being a pixel out of place, so I think we're at two ends of the spectrum ;)
---
Watched that movie a month or two ago after not seeing it for a while.
---
Movie is so fucking good lol
---
Thank god I have a pet. /shoo
---
Master loot all the way for that boss. Dont trust anyone besides guild.
---
You can‚Äôt track herbs and ore at the same time, can you? That seems like the biggest hurdle for me
---
However this obviously doesn't concern a warrior :)
---
Earthshaker? :)
---
I‚Äôm slugging along at level 42, and expect I will just live in the BGs as a shadow priest. Never really enjoyed raiding as a healer that much
---
warriors with windfury wants a word with you tho
---
Clearly
---
Shunters gonna shunt
---
Uhhhhhh doubt
---
Ok. Still give them to a dagger rogue though.
---
Ayyy bigglesworth gang
---
Frost mage and bear tank can do some pretty great aoe farming
---
Yeah all of my friends that leveled as enchanters have regretted it. No greens to vendor and all that
---
this is what I ment?
---
This happened to me for a bit... Leveled a hunter to 34, then a druid to 41 (with Mount), then a warrior to 32. I finally went back to stick with the hunter so now he is 59 as of last night with a lil over 1k gold saved. Very excited for the epic mount soon....the grind has been wild. I sold a ton of stuff on the AH.
---
I like how you triggered him by just asking fora source.
---
Man no shaman should ever roll on that when there‚Äôs a warrior in the group,shamans should get other one handlers not ironfoe
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve found no matter how many levels I get the rotation never changes
---
Ganking ain‚Äôt easy.
---
Good spell yes, but you are not going to respec before 60 and it takes 11 levels before you reach it so more health and a 50% is probably a wiser investment in my opinion
---
I find it strange that you consider that a personal attack.
---
I guess if you go out looking to be a victim every single day of your life, you'll succeed.
---
day after tomorrow, sincerly EU
---
the problem is that it wont drop. 1 drop out of 50 runs is insane
---
For me both dropped from the same kill and I won both rolls, was only my 5th or so ubrs run :)
---
More or less the same way I did it. At 50 I respecced to Restoration wich came in handy for dungeons but was a pain for solo leveling.
---
This comment wins!!
---
Saturdays?
---
Smart move! By the time I could start making money the price was 15g+/leather  =(
---
I believe the neck is better for longer.
---
Alliance has been great for me because i knew pvp servers were going to be a useless shithole as an Alliance player, so i rolled pve.
---
I worked really hard on it, dude
---
huge dmg numbers 
---
as in the lvl 40 300dmg whitehitcrit?
---
or that bigass 150 Judgment drop
---
or how about that 500dmg proc that you make every 3 minutes or so
---
Uh I think the player cast bar is part of the default UI, so hiding your player frame also gets rid of it. ClassicCastBars only adds target/nameplate cast bars.
---
Hear hear, I found badges lovely as well. You didn't HAVE to farm them, but there were really nice things to have, so why not help a guildie out and run the heroic with him? I loved the TBC heroics.
---
Could always suicide into a pack of mobs and revive at the spirit guy at the grave yard if you‚Äôre just concerned about the run back
---
Just can‚Äôt not heal people?
---
Hit 41 with my shaman...kind of bored and want to start a lock.
---
I'm not going to be concise, I can tell you now. Here we go.
---
&gt; goldfish memory
---
is a colloquialism, not used in speech to be a literal or factually correct phrasing. More examples: A New York minute is not a full minute, it means a passing, fleeting moment. Goldfish memory was an old, widespread colloquialism which was eventually researched; turns out goldfish have memories upwards of 5 minutes. The term is still widely understood. As a matter of fact, when I used it to describe you, you instantly understood what I meant and were quick to rebut the only way you could: point out the recent research (that only arose from the term being widely accepted).
---
---------------------------
---
&gt; when I used it correctly since if additional information is required to articulate the point clearly then it's still "concise" lmao
---
No, that would make it less concise if you elaborated to three lines on a yes or no question. A key requirement of being concise is to be brief. You expanded on your answer without even addressing the initial yes or no question.
---
Really a moot point when, once again, and I'm being patient here, returning to the point:
---
&gt; So the many accounts of people who played in Vanilla seeing VC used means nothing, while your example here is supposed to count?
---
^ You need to firstly accept that *both* servers that used DM and servers that used VC existed.
---
Now that you've come to that acceptance, you can then argue if it's 'wrong' or not.
---
-----------------------------
---
So on to the **non**-yes-or-no part of the question:
---
You are saying: It's made-up shit and they were wrong and continued to be wrong.
---
Fair enough. But keep this train of thought:
---
History: It was 'wrong', but entire servers used it and it became accepted on those servers. (see rest of thread)
---
What we have is some people trying to shut down the usage of a very widely-used and understood acronym on some servers. I can see why it would be a sticking point for close-minded people, but the existence of VC literally doesn't harm the LFG channel more than just pissing off people with nothing better to do or without outlets in their lives.
---
The best outcome with all parties considered would be: 
---
"VC/DM" defaulting to Deadmines.
---
DME DMW DMN Tribute.
---
That way you service all groups:
---
Newbies who have no clue DM is split into wings that are separated.
---
Newbies who would otherwise PM people running DMs without knowledge of shift-click or DM wings.
---
Veterans like you and I who know the damn difference and all the nuances benefit and now never have to shift-click at all.
---
I can guarantee you people running DM are going to be posting just DM without the wing for whatever reasons they have. I'd bet gold on it. It's happened before, it'll happen again.
---
Obviously it isn't better than thunderfury, thunderfury isn't a phase 1 weapon though which is what we're discussing...
---
&gt;I find it strange that you consider that a personal attack.
---
because 'type of person who brought us bfa' was totally meant as a positive. 
---
&gt;I guess if you go out looking to be a victim every single day of your life, you'll succeed.
---
At least you comments are consistent - they are all crocks of shit.
---
Do you mean via resets? If so, once you clear a dungeon, pass party lead to someone outside of the instance, log out, and have them reset it while you‚Äôre offline. This will reset the instance and when you log in you‚Äôll be inside the dungeon at the start. You can also do this if you and your alt are in a group together, it just takes 2 minutes for party lead to pass from your main to your alt (due to main being offline), and then you can reset &amp; hop back onto your main.
---
No one asked
---
Yeah I was kinda surprised too. Obviously I‚Äôm a ‚Äútreat to talk to‚Äù because I wanted source for his statement :D
---
Nah its about the racials. I remember in wotlk a lot of PvP players from Horde switched to Alliance when Humans became the Trinket Racial because it was so broken
---
Achievements, barbershop, dual spec, rated BGs
---
The chance to hit kinda outweighs the double weapons and grants you some survivability but it also results in longer killing times. 
---
Everything is viable for leveling. You just end up doing it a bit slower.
---
Hit cap for hunter is 9% total, and having 305 weapon skill reduces that to 6%.
---
That's completely opposite for me. I've bought mount at 40. Now I'm 43 and I still have 0 gold.
---
Hmm, resilience was what made PvP interesting in my opinion... but obviously there's as many opinions as there's people :D
---
Then what weapon do you give to a tank?
---
The same server, you also can‚Äôt read as I already stated I don‚Äôt have enchanting. I just don‚Äôt mind the enchanters abusing a system, plenty of systems get abused. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs anymore toxic than someone like me camping another herbalist for 4 hours herbing the same zone as me. That‚Äôs literally the point I was making. Atleast this guy was spoken to before it happened. 
---
I‚Äôve had entire guilds camp me for half a day because they want an area for rep (MC rep). Crusader recipe, or eye of shadow and I can‚Äôt physically play my character for hours on end. Didn‚Äôt need to make a post about it complaining.
---
Atleast he was warned it was gunna happen was my point.
---
Leave it just the way it was, minus flying mounts.
---
That dude got killed, SO HARD.  
---
Pretty much like OP, so yeah, appropriate.
---
Me on heartseeker
---
Rogues or hunters all the time
---
Most of it being the ignorance. People didn't know jack shit about the game back then. I find myself amazed at my pve progress considering I dinged on Oct 3rd.
---
I don't do any quests at all with the exception of quests I'm forced to do in order to get dungeon quests, like I needed to collect raptor horns in the barrens in order to get one of the WC quests. Other than that, I'm not planning to do any of them unless it offers a huge gear upgrade. Most of my gear has been from the dungeons though, because you see a LOT of greens as you level.
---
Oh man, I think Dun Morogh is my least favorite starter zone. Only bit I like is Ironforge being right there. Tirisfal &gt; Elwynn &gt; Teldrassil &gt; Mulgore &gt; Durotar &gt; Dun Morogh for me. I guess that's an unpopular opinion, though.
---
Yeah they do if you disable nameplates (healthbars). The green/blue names have guild tags below them.
---
It‚Äôs about 700g or so, but Warlocks that have already done the quest can ‚ÄúSell‚Äù 200g worth of items they can reuse, so you can probably get it for 550ish after tipping the other warlock
---
Have a bank alt. Everything worth selling on AH just mail it to the alt to free up bag space and over time you'll make a decent amount of wealth.
---
Im not disagreeing with your threat and point at all. Im just saying that Mages have the tools to help the situation, if they want to.
---
In LBRS if you use demoshout on certain roaches they will run away and pull extra mobs. This.. is an actual thing.
---
Yeah I think in future retrospect I will always have a Enchanting alt but never as my main.
---
&gt; I once did the math on the cost of a war. If they would have sold the gold on 3th party websited they would have 2000 euro.
---
Meanwhile, Alex, acting as the middleman in a trade between 2 players whose guilds were at war, stole the sword which was being sold. The 7 million gold that the sword was being sold for was worth around $8000 at the time.

---
I agree, this sounds quite nice.
---
In regards to daily quests. I admit that they were boring and dumb and I rarely did them and instead decided to be broke. But how is that system worse than classic. 
---
Instead of doing 10 boring quests for free gold we have mages running low level dungeons to aoe farm. And when DM comes out everyone will be endlessly running weird abominations of the zone just to sell items and farm gold. 
---
Or people just mindlessly farming mobs for random mats. How is this style of farming so much better than daily quests?
---
It actually was bis for hunter using pre 1.12 itemization.
---
The important thing is that you consider it to be non-positive as that's the context you've assigned to my statement.
---
But the logical stance you're taking on my comments is looking great.  üëå
---
I was in it for the people, but those people were in it for the loot. From my first major guild, I only talk to two of them.
---
No, he's wrong. It's only enchants, not the "Equip" effects.
---
I'm gonna go with the no changes crowd here, that sounds retarded.
---
Huh. Its back to 'I don't follow' mate.
---
&gt; Really not a fan of them pushing content forward to appease the hardcore players
---
It's probably not to appease anyone but rather to compete with Archeage's big new launch on the same day.
---
When I was leveling my Undead mage every Alliance member I came across just tried to fight me. And I thought to myself, "fucking Alliance". 
---
But some friends and I rolled Alliance on a different server and the Horde is the just as aggressive.
---
You sound just like me, right down to the C# / .NET love... I haven't dabbled with LUA much other than looking at addons when they break with updates, it kinda reminds me of Python a bit.
---
As for UI design, I've used [ElvUI](https://www.tukui.org/classic-addons.php?id=2) for years and recently found the [Redtuzk](https://www.tukui.org/classic-addons.php?id=6) mod which I've then altered a bit myself to suit my style more. I play across three devices with resolutions of 1920x1080 and 1366x768, will post some screenshots of my layout later if you're interested. My changes basically involve fixing the tooltip location, moving the unitframes down towards the bottom of the screen, slightly heightening the chat boxes and changing the actionbars to just be bar 1 and 2 horizontal along the bottom, 12 buttons per bar. The two hidden bars on the right (appear on mouseover) more than suit my needs for things like hearthstone, rez spells and professions. I also heavily utilise macros; all my shaman shocks are on keybind 2, with Earth Shock being unmodded, shift &gt; Flame Shock and Ctrl &gt; Frost Shock. Totems are a similar setup, also merged Purge and Cure Poison using a combination of @target and @mouseover.
---
Inspiration-wise, I just look through the profile exports section of the ElvUI forums occasionally when I decide I don't like something but overall, this Redtuzk with minimal alterations is working out pretty well for me.
---
Believe neck is BiS for a while, for both tanking and dps.

Take away the 2.3 and 2.4 nerfs and dumbdowns (e.g. scatttr shot and avng shield dont hit cced tgts)
---
Everyone needs epic mount bro. Always roll last if you can. :)
---
The difference there is that SM has 4 wings with a shitload of bosses and really good xp.  DM is a dungeon that can pretty much be skipped (theres other ones in horde zones near the same level that are just easier to get to/do for the horde).
---
SM is pretty much all you have in the mid to late 30s, other than Gnomer i guess, or RFD once you get to the higher end.  Gnomer has a literal port for horde so theyre not at a disadvantage (and no one wants to do that hellhole), and RFD is in the the Barrens with a kind of shitty run for the Alliance.  Not as bad as SM, but still not great.
---
&gt; There are plenty of women in pvp servers. But i think people assume PVP servers to be more for advance players
---
That could well be. I've just always considered PvP servers to be the "default". For the full experience of WoW, you go PvP. I'm not even really a PvPer, and I couldn't imagine ever playing on a PvE server.
---
Hunters mark, dash, intimidate, concussive shot. You'll never get away.
---
Wowhead said patch because Blizzard did in a blue when they thought there would only be 6 big patches.  
---
Wowhead is not Blizzard. 
---
Blizzard made the post saying first patch in mid august, I don't know when they announced they would split DM and the first patch but it was likely after that.  
---
Regardless what word they used, in all the sources linked above it's pretty obvious if you use contextual common sense...
---
It is, and it's even worse when you started playing years ago before any expansions, and then got close to max and they released the first exp., then close to max level on it,  and they released the next one, etc . I never truly got to experience end game content because I was caught always level chasing, plus doing this exact thing and making tons of irrelevant alts. üòÇ
---
I have a memory of our main tank having buffs removed when they weren't at "buff" cap I remember getting yelled at to put fort on him and he lost some world buff and the raid stopped and we couldn't figure out wtf happened. (Rebuff during a fight). I think this is how it was. Sorry
---
But my own guild got ~7 or 8 last night when we went to full clear all the trash again.
---
assuming the classicdb stats are correct, the drop rates are very roughly 1/20 per trash mob? So a good number of epics per full trash clear seems reasonable.
---
Do we actually know this 100% though? Last i checked yeah wowhead-guides etc states it but they cannot be sure, they also got the mats wrong so..
---
The difference between levels for experience isn't *that* crazy, and it is a bit counteracted by monster/quest experience increases - the important factor is efficiency. From 30-44ish there are rough patches for efficiency (lots of scattered quests, travel time, etc compared to clear and dense questlines). 50-58 I'd say is not that bad at all, yes it takes more time but is less grindy and more clear for zones and quests (or you can just keep dungeon grinding)
---
On the Baron Geddon encounter, when you're the bomb you need to run out of the raid. Seems like a pretty big one people don't know about.
---
Look at those torpedoes chasing the orc, beautiful !
---
Alex the stealer of the Magic Long Sword!
---
Good times.
---
i like to do sports... sorry if it hurt your feelings
---
Or maybe, some people played horde and didn't even know that dungeon existed until it was no longer relevant to them.
---
Cue Headless Horseman laugh.
---
Yeah as dancer said it sometimes bugs but not often at all and it makes reading quests so much fun. It made me appreciate questing so much more
---
Doesnt really help that this sub has *always* been massively horde leaning.
---
&gt; /Dance will drop them from combat
---
This is hilarious if you're trolling...
---
... but if you don't, do you have to have them targetted for it to work?
---
I did this all the time with my rogue in AB.
---
As a rogue, sometimes you're just useless in AB pugs
---
But, I could usually bait 2-3 enemies to chase me around for a couple minutes. I'd draw them as far away as I could, and they'd usually be out of the fight much longer than a spirit rez or two.
---
This effect trickles down and usually ends up with us capturing a base
---
Is there something like The Undermine Journal, but for CLASSIC and EU (and free).  
---
I know that bootybaygazette exist, but EU servers are not supported, and it will be subscription based.  
---
If it doesn't exist, is there an addon (or something) that make graph from auctioneer AH scans ? if i scan a lot eveyday, i should have usable graphs
---
someone said it wasn't working any more yesterday but worth a try:
---
have a friend invite you to a group, log out (or if you exit game wait 20 seconds) then ask them to reset dungeons, when you log back in you'll be at the entrance.
---
you could also do it with your own alt (providing someone invites you both to a group then leaving it as a group consisting of yourself and your alt). if you log out of your main and into your alt who is still in the group after 2 minutes your alt becomes the group leader and can reset the dungeon.
---
I guess it's heightened in WoW due to disconnect, less social backlash and the "game environment".
---
But yeah, my guild experience helps me navigate church politics. There's also a person who acts like they have more authority than they do.
---
Our loot council is working extremely well right now. Each class has a rep in the loot council and each rep talked with the core class members to see if they want to roll off or give out upgrades based on a combination of priority/upgrade strength. For classes that opted for roll offs, they all just roll for each piece. Sometimes they've already agreed on a RR style for certain things. For all the other classes, we link our existing piece and then the Loot Council decides which upgrade is best for the raid. Things are taken into account, like how often that player raids (we only run one raid so people who are routinely signing up late get benched) and if that piece would provide a set piece bonus that's good, etc, but for the most part it goes to the person who has the shittiest piece of gear in that slot currently.
---
Feels really fair, imo. Loot is going out in a way that gives us the biggest power spike each week and some of the biggest items are all on a RR list. So glad I don't have to deal with DKP.
---
Even Alliance gather RFD every hour or two.
---
So were the other old school rides, as far as I'm aware. The white stallion looks great, I just mention the saber because I play a nelf so it'd be easier for me to get if, say, they implemented the mounts for a limited time. Grinding for stormwind exalted would likely take way too long, plus the cost of horse riding and another epic mount.
---
Found the guy that kept killing me in Badlands while I was killing Earth Elementals for my quest.
---
I think im more used to prot warrior tanking that builds threat faster than an arms or whatever, so i intend to dps a bit earlier. I havent run into many arms tanks or whatever they‚Äôre refered to as but the ones i have it was hard for them to hold aggro.
---
people still saying LF SM and not mentioning the dungeon but you expecting them to use DM T. Lol, no
---
Technically correct, but I am not having any issues with Gold. Had my mount the minute I dinged 40 and currently have ~100G and no real need to buy anything. I just vendor most quest rewards/sell things I cannot wear on AH.
---
I'll probably change professions when I hit 60 or something. Any suggestions on good professions for Druids that can make money and/or benefit PvP?
---
Ha Ha.
---
\&gt;was totally meant as a positive comment
---
You didn't mean it as a positive nor would the majority of the posters here take it as positive. 
---
Someone not full to the brim with shit would recognize that as a personal remark. Why am I wasting my time.
---
The only thing that would make a prot-specced warrior build aggro faster is the reduced rage cost of sunder armor and access to shield slam.  
---
It doesn't make sense for a leveling warrior to level as prot, it is extremely slow compared to Arms or Fury.
---
FYI, the dynamic level calculation bit also didn't happen  on all mobs with ?? Some were just obfuscated oddly enough.
---
&gt; Can I just "tank" using my 2 hander and in Battle Stance? Just use Demo shout, WW, sunder Armor?
---
My general idea is to stay in defensive with shield, then switch to my 2H and zerker stance for whirlwind every 10s, then back to defense/sheild. For easy pulls, it really doesn't matter what you do, but this allows you to get a lot of threat to multiple targets, without compromising your survivability. I suspect you could get away with doing this even in arm at your level.
---
Professions, and just keep picking everything up and vendoring/AH'ing efficiently. Honestly, I just started 'bank-alting' recently and it has made quite the difference; essentially, instead of vendoring certain things (mats, greens, etc), throw them up on the AH. Any green that vendors for like 1g40s can be AH'd for 2-4g (baring like, spirit rolls on horde plate gear). During peak times I take advantage of the low deposit on the 2hr auction, otherwise do it for 8hrs before peak time (don't bother listing over night, or 24hr). On top of this, just mailing inventories of crap to an alt makes organizing your main easier. And it's kinda fun logging into your bank alt, opening a mailbox full of crap, and taking the time to strategize your sales, then mail all that $$$ back
---
I saved up 4 zones worth of quests until hitting 60, and got my epic mount 2 days after i dinged.
---
Well considering the rest of the thread is about how much space raid consumes takes up I think your second point is pretty much invalid.  The first point is fine and fair.  I personally only bring a few stacks of food and leave Natalie away on trash.  But I do see plenty of hunters who insist on using their pet on every pull which is fine too.
---
Mograine is pretty well 50 50 % balanced.  
---
Only login queue is at sunday around prime time... so very decent to play on !
---
Thanks for your input. I already anticipate getting my shit pushed in during pvp so I'm not really worried about that. I kinda want to just...not miss, and not die (as easily).
---
I leveled a Holy paladin before, so I have the patience for it.
---
You need to stop projecting.  I'm elated.  Blizzard gave me the game that was taken away from me to appease the soft majority.  I take most of what you just said as a compliment.
---
That doesn't mean I won't still hold the type of opinion that ruined WoW retail in Stark contempt.
---
Your posting in a thread about WoW Classic as someone who doesn't play or enjoy the game is trollish behavior.  You are welcome to your opinions, but you're literally spending time out of your day discussing something you don't like.  What a miserable existence that must be.
---
Go post in a subreddit of something you love, if there is any such thing.
---
Many know it, but lots don't since WoW had become a ROFLSTOMP game.
---
In Deadmines at the final pirate ship, if things do bad during the last fight (or accidentally pulling the whole top of the ship by accident) you can jump on the paddlewheel of the boat and after waiting a few minutes all mobs will reset.  In the case of Vancleef, his guards will despawn.
---
that's all I did it was the first pull. It was just a funny incident really, was my first time tanking in a long time and I didn't want us to die cause of me not handling aggro. He just told me he was attacking it. When I asked why the other mob was loosing hp he just said fuck this I am out. I didn't even loose aggro just wanted the healer to die first .
---
And it would have a fix to stop the LFG addons...
---
It definitely still works. I have a separate bank account so I can log on both at the same time, saves the hassle of waiting for lead to pass.
---
You need addon that parse chats, like Puggle.  
---
And you need to join channels for this.  
---
Type /join LookingForGroup  
---
Then rightclick General channel, add new window. Go to settings, remove /4 channel from General tab and add it to new window you created.  
---
This way 24/7 spam from /4 channel won't spam you, and you will use Puggle to see already parsed results.

Nah it's just that tanks get geared fast and stop running dungeons. It's not rocket science.

Neck. Definitely

Awesome! Thanks for the reply and links. I've heard of ElvUI but haven't given it a go myself. Will take a look tonight when I log on. The raid frames in the Redtuzk look awesome. That's exactly what I'm looking for!
---
I'll probably spend hours looking through the profile exports. I find that my UI takes a lot of small bits and bobs from other people's designs and making some combination of lots of ideas, so that forum looks like a great place to start! Thanks :)
---
Ironically, I find that sometimes the play is to mark skull and give up on it. Bash it, taunt it maybe, but just get aggro on the other mobs while they kill the first target
---
I'm sure there are actual numbers or times out there, but this is a list of guilds who killed Nefarian on the first lockout on a big private server:
---
/r/lightshope/comments/9x1vy4/first_lockout_nefarian_kills/
---
If that many guilds can kill it in one lockout, there will be some guilds who just breeze through it in a couple hours upon launch. I've got my money on Progress, they're well known for speedruns and have more than enough practice.
---
As I said, my very first experience playing this game back in 2005, I played on a PVE realm (Gilneas to be exact!). It is just so weird seeing a bunch of horde near you, but aren't attacking you cuz they can't. I hadn't even known the difference between PVE and PVP back then. And by the time I figured it out, my character was already like lvl 45. But, it truly did strip some if the fun experience away.
---
The problem with the mats is that during TBC they nerfed the quantity of certain mats needed so there are 2 strings of quests. We are getting the pre nerfed quests.
---
Unfortunately not.  AP trinkets drop in Dire Maul and Black Rock Depths (mid and late 50s dungeons), and will have heavy competition as every physical DPS class wants them.  You can get Mark of the Chosen (chance on getting hit to get +25 to all stats for 1 minute) from a quest in Maraudon (high 40s dungeon) in a few levels as well.  It is great for leveling and also if you decide to tank some end-game, don't ever get rid of it even though it's a green.  In fact, there are so few trinkets in the game you really shouldn't get rid of any.  You'll need to run Maraudon a lot for your Blackstone ring (hit and ap) anyways, which also has heavy competition.  I'd recommend using a site like wowhead, classicdb, or itemization (dot) info to search up gear with the stats you want.  This will help you organize and prioritize your quests and dungeon runs.
---
I personally don't like the concept of heroic dungeons. Would prefer some instances to be easier and some to be difficult on their own. Just weird for the world to change when you press a button.

Disagree.
---
Most people know the saying:  "If the tank dies, it's the healer's fault.  If the healer dies it's the tank's fault.  If the DPS die it's their own fault."
---
Otherwise, what sucks about tanking isn't the role or the stress; those just serve to only have people who WANT to be tanks be tanks.  What sucks is leveling up a tank.
---
Archeage who?
---
its a good drop for him but they may be harder to sell then he thinks
---
there have been at least 3 and as many as 5 on the AH on my server at all times as low as 300g. guilde has been trying to sell a pair for weeks
---
Look at what Americans call their kids and no fantasy figure names beats that in terms of ‚Äúshock‚Äù
---
In TBC it didn't matter as much. There were still fights in the Elemental Plateau and places like that. But the main PvP for me were Arenas anyways.  
---
Maybe a longer mounting time for flying mounts would allow for more world PvP. Along with a way to actually dismount players that are already in the air.
---
Ah screw it, I really don't care. Flying or no, I'd still properly enjoy TBC tbfh.
---
&gt;BRM is camped enough as it is
---
Well i feel this is balanced as well.  
---
one time im being ganked by an Alliance raid and the other time its the other way around...  
---
So your anecdotal statement is no proof at all.  
---
Unless proven otherwise, Mograine is 50 - 50 balanced.
---
On the bright side, Warlock brings basically everything else to the table, so that's nice. Free mount, best caster DPS come Naxx, god tier PvP. The only thing holding the class back is no inherent hit on Shadow bolt (until gear) and high threat generation (until gear) Class basically has no downsides, I have no idea why we're not more popular.
---
I had a feeling it would be something like that. An idea for an addon is usually the part I struggle because most problems have solutions given the maturity of the addon community for WoW. I'll like only go down that path if I've exhausted all possible avenues first and then start small. Thanks for the reply!
---
You do realize that there are still tons of BIS items in the other dungeons? Anyone who believes DM will kill these dungeons doesn't know that the hell they're talking about.
---
I want some of the fixes TBC brought (off specs, better raids, class balance) without some of the additions like flying mounts, heroic, dailies, etc...
---
Ideally, we get a choice: we can choose to go to TBC or we can choose to remain on Classic. Moreover, we could potentially have characters on both.
---
Some people might say "character transfers" to TBC, but I actually think it would be better to have people level from scratch. On PVP servers, the try-hards will have a significant advantage over the casuals as AQ40/Naxx gear is great gear in TBC until ~lvl 66.
---
Otherwise, TBC would exist as it was: #nochangesII...yes, flying and all.
---
Yeah bo more wasted runs too. No more guild spending a raid night downing Ony and getting two more druid helms that were gonna be disenchanted
---
Wild guess, vender trash is higher
---
I just finished getting my last piece of pre raid bis. As a resto shaman, DM replaces 8 pieces of that bis... fuck me lol
---
Check out trade skill master
---
I've been playing for 15 years, I  never knew this either, in fact I don't think I ever thought about what it meant I just knew what it was.
---
I wasn't being sarcastic, I legitimately think you are an epic elite gamer for playing classic on wow pvp.
---
I also hope you have a great day man
---
Yeah completely forgot I made myself a dreamweave circlet so I'll just hold off for that. It seems maybe they changed the level when 2.0 rolled around because all the comments saying 45 are dated with that version.
---
Well they have a hunter and a priest. Logically it would make sense for me to do tanking. I'm pretty new to it but it seems fun and engaging. Also going pure gathering professions because I anticipate being poor 90% of the time.
---
*So far* it isn't terrible, warrior leveling.
---
Not sure why you are downvoted. I understand that people new to warrior may have issues figuring it out, but there is really no need for the addon if someone played a warrior for some time.     
---
Only "need" for swing timer is if you really want to minmax PVP, it's more precise than the "feeling", but personally I still prefer playing without it because I tend to focus on the timer too much..     
---
But you know, some streamers had it, Wowhead said its good, so everyone automatically assumes it can't be played without swing timer.. Damn sheeps..
---
And the thing was, the gear you got was basically a little worse than Kara gear, so it's not like it ruined anything
---
Go check the GM's post, he straight up provided sshots of them admitting their garbage plans in discord rofl and pointing out how they enacted it.
---
There's a guild named Toxic on Faerlina horde. They literally labeled themselves and  people still complain when one  of them ninjas something.
---
I first encountered them at like level 35 in SM. Invited a rogues, saw their guild name, then booted thee guy cuz I ain't got time for an asshole that just needs on everything.
---
So make your own groups.
---
iirc your pet can only learn like 4 "active" abilities, like growl and bite. So if your cat already has growl, bite, claw, and dash, you would not be able to teach it prowl.
---
An addon designer after my own heart. Snapping to grids and being able to change a position of an element by 1 pixel is a sign of someone with an eye for design ;)
---
I haven't stopped.
---
I did a similar thing. Got a Hyacinth Macaw drop while questing. Figured it was just a random bird drop worth 10g or so at best and equipped it. Come to find out it's one of the rarest pet drops in the game and I could have sold it for a very pretty penny &gt;&lt;
---
I'm on a pvp server.  Bigger bubbles and bigger fort have saved my life both while questing and when someone tries to gank.
---
Mana reduction on heals (3/3) isn't available until 37.  Inner focus is at 25 and meditation finishes at 28.  That's a long way to go until getting reduced heal cost.  I'm leveling with Improved Wand Spec and Spirit Tap.  Which makes the holy tree really less desirable prior to 40.
---
Bubbles on non warriors/druids or in emergencies is amazing.  Bubbling mages during AoEs really helps out.
---
With Meditation, if you assume best case, using a single cast 305 mana heal and my current 168 mp/5 from spirit:
---
* Holy has a cost reduction of 46 mana
---
* Disc has regenerated 28 more mana
---
This means that holy has good mana efficiency but takes substantially more talent points to achieve it.  Additionally, if you cast anything but Heal, PoH, Holy Nova, PW:S, renew, scream, etc, your mana efficiency tanks.
---
I'm not saying that holy is bad, far from it.  I'm saying that for my playstyle, Disc out performs Holy at the lower levels.  Better mana regen, fewer talent points to achieve the higher tier spells, better WPvP utility.  At 40, I have  a mana burn I can use in PvP, a bigger mana pool, and cheaper instants.
---
Not having pushback does suck but it's an easy 2 points into holy.  I don't have to be holy spec to get it.  And again, having a 3 second heal over a 2.5 second one doesn't really matter in dungeons.  Of the countless times I've been in SM or RFD, only one pull did not having a faster heal matter.  And that was more because I tried using Heal when I should have used Flash Heal.  Far more pulls and runs have used the superior mana regen to keep everyone alive and avoid wipes even when I'm oom.
---
Inner Focus is a game changer.  It doesn't cause you to enter the 5 second rule and using IF &gt; Heal, means you are still regenning at 100%.  Using it before a PoH when your group is getting eaten by AoEs is amazing.
---
Finally, for longer cast smites, I just adapt.  It's not hard to use.  I typically open with Holy Fire &gt; Mind Blast.  SW:P then bubble.  Toss smite and MB off cooldown until 20-30%, refresh SW:P then wand the rest.  The time it takes to run to the next mob is all the time I need to get maximum use out of Spirit Tap.  If I'm fighting green mobs, they will barely break the bubble.  If I'm fighting yellow, I'll take some damage but not substantially.  Total kill time is around 25-30 seconds.  I never have to drink or eat while grinding if I pull correctly.
---
The first rag kill was a month and a half after DM release.
---
Wouldn't make the dungeon that much harder. Leaving known bugs in because it puts players who are late to the party at a disadvantage is silly.
---
Do NOT however pre dot all the mobs up when the tank is LoS pulling, or you've just guaranteed you'll tank the entire pack
---
What's the add-on for the bottom window called? With all the info?

Definitely clever use of game mechanics. Just pissed I never got to use it myself before it was fixed. Same with the. BRD torch room.

---
Currently lvl 38 Enhance Shaman, and i need help deciding what spec to run at level 60.  From what i gather resto is more of a PvE spec and elemental is more of a PvP spec, and enhance is non viable i guess???  i enjoy playing enhance right now but is there no spot for them at endgame play?
---
Let me say, i'm a casual player mostly questing and doing 5 man dungeon runs.  And i'm guessing that running 40 man raids probably isn't in my future as i'm not hardcore enough.  
---
Help me because i'm having a hard time deciding what type of gear i should be collecting at this point!
---
Why are all your rogues dagger spec? If you are all playing sub-optimal dps specs, it doesn't make sense to gear the tanks like that because they are never gonna have issues holding threat whatsoever.
---
Sounds like a guild problem.
---
No, that's a very fair point. I have to admit if I was to roll one of the two classes, I would pick Spriest.
---
GANG VC REPRESENT

Probably #1 is deathbringer for orc, and quel'serrar for everyone else, but honestly all those choices are p good and it's not like you're gonna be sucking eggs wth any of them.

&gt;I've been with my raid group for fifteen+ years
---
Wait, you've been with your raid group since Vanilla? How many guild's loot systems have you personally experienced in that time frame, then?
---
Do you just right click the ring or does it need to be equipped?
---
Huh.. I thought it was the other way around.

This may have been before the honor system, but we used to raid Astranaar and kill everyone but the gryphon master (because he's a mean son of a bitch). It would've been impossible if the guard spam existed.
---
Lost this on my first run and haven't seen it since :(
---
its all we have that's presented by the company let's be real
---
Tank pulls. If DPS ninja pulls, then say "please do not pull". If they continue to deliberately pull, then vote kick.  
---
Also, give them the benefit of the doubt. Sometimes DPS gets trigger happy or pulls by accident. We all make mistakes.
---
Night elf has improved stealth so it's not a complete loss.
---
I've done a number if +5s for warriors in that level range. Seems like good value. I bought the mats for the last one and it was only 42silver.
---
You can pull last boss in Uldaman to the top room to prevent him from summoning ads. Leave healer and 1 dps there, pop speed potions/sprint and run there after activating boss.
---
Just add a bunch of stairs here and there.

We want to clear raids at a relaxed pace with a fun group. Then turn around and take that gear and organization and put it to use cracking Alliance skulls. 
---
#### Schedule
---
Progression raids will be Wednesday/Thursday, starting around 9pm EST. Farm raids will take place on weekends. Drinking encouraged, but not mandatory.
---
Tuesday night Attunement runs will be hosted as needed at 9:30pm EST to get fresh players the attunements they need
---
#### Loot Distribution
---
EPGP with reserves on key loot
---
#### Looking For
---
*New Players!* - We know Classic is an opportunity for a lot of players who never experienced vanilla (or Warcraft at all!) to join the game. We happily accept you!
---
*Raiders!* - We are looking for members to fill out our raid team. We are recruiting all classes, with an emphasis on healers and dps!

---
Is that how it actually works or are you just guessing now :)
---
Scholo any%
---
After one year of running MC, about 75% of guilds will have both bindings. Maybe not *every* raid, but most people won't be running MC in P6 for bindings. Which makes the eternal quintessence pretty useless.
---
I don't mind going to Azshara once a week as Horde but I think it'd be a pain in the ass really quickly as Alliance.
---
Yeet... get the fuck out of here
---
Not just up to 60, you can tank every 60 dungeon in a full dps spec. Just throw on a shield and replace your leather/mail items with a plate alternative.
---
i'm not 100% sure of it, just saying the blue post in that link was before they decided to bring dire maul release forward so they may have left it in phase 2 or they may bring it forward with dire maul as you will have yet another key that could go in the key ring from dire maul
---
I‚Äôve leveled 3 horde characters to 60 before. I‚Äôm on my first alliance progression ever right now, and it‚Äôs pretty awful. There is absolutely no way that alliance isn‚Äôt disadvantaged leveling on a pvp server.
---
It's not the range - it's the average. On average that weapon will hit for (70+40)/2 = 55. That's the number you want to compare to other weapons
---
Equipped and clicked
---
Will check it out ty. Didn‚Äôt know they did classic stuff, just assumed only retail side  for some reason ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Ok so I had the math backwards then if that's true.. Which is even more reason why DM isn't ahead of schedule.
---
No regrets rolling on a PVE server. Being able to just play the game with griefing turned off is great!
---
It's only the rare that spawns outside of Diremaul - It's not inside the dungeon.
---
Yeah I feel the same way. I play on a pretty balanced server though.
---
Instant AOE
---
Pulling for the tank
---
Overall impatience
---
What‚Äôs painful about it? It‚Äôs easy, your survivability is second to none, and if you have decent gear your down time is pretty limited (when I‚Äôm grinding mobs, I have to drink and bandage once every 8).
---
That's the best part.. If I fuck up, I fuck up.  Calculated as I said haha.  It adds efficiency, I def won't act like that unless I know the dungeon.
---
I always got ganked by gnome mages or human warriors, seems like those are the equivalent of undead rogue on the alliance side.
---
They can also be abundant when me and my two friends fly above common farming spots and swoop in to start fights. You cant pick up nodes while flying. Pretty easy to start fights still. Like I said just as easily as it is to get in the air and away from danger you can use that same advantage to bring the fight to a group of players killing things.

#  &lt;Hope Rises&gt; | Relaxed ‚Äúmediumcore‚Äù | Raids once per week for the life of Classic | Horde @ Herod
---
Founded back in 2014 on the principles of positivity, loyalty, and freedom, &lt;HR&gt; has gotten a rez for Classic.
---
‚Ä¢ Though some of us will be putting hardcore hours into Classic, **we will ‚Äúofficially‚Äù raid just once per week on Tuesdays (+50 wife points) starting in January 2020 so you can level enjoy the leveling process! (We are going to be leading PUG raids in the interim, with our first guild-hosted MC coming on 10/22!!!)**
---
‚Ä¢ 8 PM Central start time for raids; raids will last 3-4 hours as needed (we will "officially" begin raiding in January 2020, with unofficial PUGs filling in the time until then)
---
‚Ä¢ Optional Saturday raids at roughly the same times
---
‚Ä¢ Freedom to spec how you want (particularly early on in MC and BWL) so long as you are also willing to change to a more meta role when asked (probably way down the line ‚Äî like AQ-40 to Naxx).
---
‚Ä¢ Active round-the-clock guild with numerous casual members so there should always be guildies to level with at your own pace.
---
Though many of us have raided Mythics in retail, we are committed to enjoying each other‚Äôs company and the mostly laid-back nature of Vanilla endgame. If you are impatient, easily frustrated, or are seeking a ‚Äúworld-first‚Äù (lol), cutting-edge, every-world-buff-is-mandatory hardcore raiding experience, then our guild is not for you. If, however, you jive with our vision of Classic and would like to join the family, or would simply like more information, feel free to comment here, DM me on Discord (Oleon#2355), or pop by the guild Discord and introduce yourself in #General chat here: [https://discord.gg/HkDRhXY](https://discord.gg/HkDRhXY)
---
Thanks, everybody! Hope to see y‚Äôall in Azeroth! \~ Oleon
---
Doubt that's possible. I recommend the TrinketMenu addon instead.
---
Like I said, I've run countless pugs and almost never wipe. And I'm just a lowly dps, not even a tank or healer. If you're always wiping in pugs you're very likely doing something wrong.
---
They added resilience so people holy paladins didn't go into arenas with each other and instagib people with absolutely no way for you to fight back. This actually happened in arenas anyhow even with resilience though. Most people knew of a 'two holy pal arena team' that were decked out in raid gear that 1 shot someone and then afk healed for a minute till they can 1 shot the other.
---
I use Blizz raid frames. When we wipe I want to ress other ressers (shaman/priest) first, but I cannot see what class people are. If peeps are alive the frames show class colour, but if they are dead everyone is transparant/grey colored. 
---
Is there a quick way to see what class someone is while they are dead?
---
I‚Äôm a level 35 warrior with 170g. Got my roll started by mining copper in Durotar and selling whatever cloth I could get my hands on.  I‚Äôve been AH flipping ever since.  I spend maybe 30 minutes to an hour or less every day on the AH.  I start my playtime by identifying things to flip, buy them, post them, then I go quest, and at the end of my play time, I collect my gold, do another cycle of flipping, log out, and when I log back in the next time, I collect my gold, and start all over again.  
---
I‚Äôm a 15 year goblin, with plenty of experience on the AH.  I hit gold cap multiple times in BC (gold cap used to be 214k in the 32 bit days), and I‚Äôve hit current gold cap twice on retail.  Saying all that, I‚Äôm not doing anything that is overly complicated or hard to understand by the average player.
---
Not really. The average group running 60 dungeons are better geared now.
---
If anything, it would just approach the difficulty level that fresh 60s had early on
---
BIG BRAIN!
---
Zg no attunement, AQ has the varying approach of a server wide attunement in the war effort and opening quest chain, bwl been covered below.
---
Naxx attunement depends on argent Dawn reputation, shitton of nexus crystals, large brilliant shards gold and righteous orbs at friendly, gets cheaper with rep levels and free at exalted
---
I just call it E'T
---
Nostalrius had amazing pathing. You could jump over a fence and the mob would go all the way around the fence to get you. In classic, I've had several times where I'll aggro a mob through a wall or through a floor. More frequently, I've pulled a mob with my bow (I'm a rogue) and they'll run straight through a wall. I'm not sure if your post is supposed to be ironic/sarcastic or not, but this is simply not true.
---
Almost every major WoW patch released by Blizzard in the past 5 years has been timed to the exact day with major releases by competing MMOs, even the smaller ones like Archeage.
---
Yep, alliance paladins were pretty much garbage compared to blood elf.
---
I think shaman is the better choice. Druid is eaiser to gear at max level though.
---
People really need to stop being salty about this. There's nothing wrong with tanks and healers farming without having to respec. This is one of the consequences of no dual spec. Not that I'm a fan of it of course. Everybody wins here though.
---
Sounds like a fellow healer on westfall
---
I've grouped with people in your guild. Cool people :D
---
People hitting 60 don't have the gear. They'd be trailing behind as heals or dps, or getting smacked as tanks, and be the first ones removed if the boss isn't going down.
---
I believe you, this is just the first time I‚Äôve ever heard of archeage. Perhaps I‚Äôm in the minority there.
---
The other day I had another Warlock 4 levels lower than me try to get me after I lifetapped to full mana. He didn't expect my Shadow Ward + HS + Health Pot + Death Coil...
---
Makes it more obnoxious because I saw him and was going to leave him alone as long as he didn't come near my quest mobs.
---
I don't get it.  At least as a rogue, there's really nothing worth my time in DM.
---
Last night, questing in STV, alliance are near, we don‚Äôt bother each other.
---
Some drood attacks them, gets fucked, runs away.
---
A lv60 alliance hunter shows up, proceeds to corpse camp me, a healing priest, follows me all the way to the coast and I levitate out to sea and hearth after dying 6-7 times.
---
Fun.
---
It does effect the combat calculations for hits/misses and crits/crushing blows.
---
For sure, I won one in an ubrs pug and instantly equipped it. I feel so whole as a dagger rogue. Rockin seal of fate with 26% crit, feels good man. Farmin ubrs guild runs for fs in between mc resets though.
---
I mean that‚Äôs very annoying, but that doesn‚Äôt really affect the 1-60 grind very much. The amount of time you have to spend leveling near grom gol can makes weeks of leveling pretty miserable.
---
Sap + Blind pet?
---
Thanks i really appreciate that :)
---
Not really sure if it's a mechanic as such but you can kite the last boss of Ulda to the top floor before the door shuts and this stops the elites spawning.
---
I appreciate your point. I feel comfortable with Vanish unbound for PVE. If I pull agro on trash, I have a few more spells to control the situation. I can generally tell when a situation is going wrong enough to vanish way ahead of time. I also can vanish to "re-open" on a boss, but at this point, I am genrally in position and can use mouse to click. With PVP, Vanish's priority may change. I may move it to Shift 2 or Shift 3.  Once I get into PVP, I will re-evaluate.
---
two questions:
---
1. Updates for Classic seem to be harder to come by than updates for BFA. Where do people go to find updates/blue posts related to classic (ie. blue posts, patch notes, updates from blizzard, etc) ?
---
2. Phase 1.5 releasing with DM, will other things originally slated for phase 2 also be released? PVP system, etc?
---
I don't think classic + will happen for one reason.. not enough players. Look how many servers there are and the average pop of them. There really isn't enough money here considering they're not going to be able to sell it as an expac for an up front cost.
---
There were less than 20, is that even a raid?
---
Bullshit. I played in both Vanilla and Classic and finding answers on google is *substantially* easier today than it ever was.
---
I just loled
---
Not at all, it doesn't break the game in any meaningful way to leave it in, and gives an unfair advantage to the fast levelers.
---
Wait. Can you pickpocket the dudes in the tavern? How much gold do you make? When it fails, do you need to vanish?
---
What? You mean people get bored of the game when it's farmed out and instantly quit after they get the gear they want?
---
I thought that vanilla was a mecca of gaming that people will never tire of and play forever.
---
I think it'll be more difficult to find tanks and healers for those other dungeons, though. There's amazing healer loot in DM and tanks want their Quel'Serrar.
---
Dont lvl prot, current prot paladin here.  If you decide to you will be disappointed to know that it's not reall effective unless you have a friend with you and or your around 50s.   If you still decide to go prot  flurry axe and sf shield make aoe a cakewalk.  Truesilver brestplate is good for a little while but will want to upgrade to demonforged if you have the gold both blacksmith recipies.  Band of the unicorn is a good spldmg ring you can get in the 40s on ah.  You will definately want uthers str trinket off ah and mark of the chosen from mauradon quest.  
---
Even if you are geared out its garbage to quest anywhere there are casters.  It's also garbage to farm anywhere there are other mages farming.  Soo just roll ret untill 50 if you decide to change you can still spec holy prot and heal effectively in duengons.  No matter what build get concecration first.
---
You can also have a healer stand on the ledge, as long as the rest of the party uses single target abilities, the healer will pull threat on all the adds but be unable to get hit.
---
So you 2v1 people and cry that they call for backup? Typical alliance scum.
---
Glad I'm playing on german servers, german discipline shines in pug xD never had any problems, except for one furry warrior who refused to tank but always wanted to pull when I was "too slow" doing it (while all the mana users were still at 10%)
---
Corgi
---
RFD can quickly change sides if you do the undead first.  After you kill the Lich, keep following the mobs you skipped and you'll end up on the live side.
---
Leaving totems in the hallway before Herod in SM will wipe the party.  Apparently, when you fight him, a whole bunch of mobs spawn up there.
---
Also the classic, you can eat and drink at the same time to speed up the next pull.
---
thats the difference between a full server and a low server
---
Depends if you raid or not, ont neck is relatively readily available and blows fordring out of the water, you'd need might chest as an alternative to the adamantoum chest though
---
I fail at jumps like this or trying to be pushed along from the front every time. Could some how wall walk/wall jump almost anywhere in Ironforge or Stormwind though.
---
They should just disable world buffs in raids anyways.  That's the real fix.  Kill 2 problems with one fix.
---
So I was healing a WC run, and a duo (dps/tank) were new to classic.  Usually never an issue, but the warrior tank was lvl 17 and didn't have defensive stance.
---
He couldn't hold aggro, but for the most part I kept everyone up.  Once I didn't, I was blamed for each death.  Had 1 guy in there who understood and agreed with me.  Had to threaten to withhold heals just to get one dps to shut up.
---
Yep, finish up work, head home, take my mind off things with a video game, and low and behold I'm getting stressed in Strat again
---
As mentioned before hand, PVP isn‚Äôt just about killing.
---
You know what‚Äôs more brutal than killing them? Getting them suspended for breaking ToS. Blizzard openly admitted safe spotting is terrain abuse and is against the rules.
---
I also do this with all alliance players, if I see a single guild name that‚Äôs against ToS, I report. Offensive name? Reported. Offensive guild rank? Reported.
---
I want to see them banned and suspended. Fuck the alliance.
---
Spam report him and smile while you get revenge, he won‚Äôt see it coming.
---
I've recently been selling Oily Blackmouths from the port in eastern Tanaris. There's a bit of competition though, especially in prime time.
---
We used our T3 into karazhan btw.
---
Is that thing really that good? Got that drop by chance while goldfarming on my warlock should I equip it over witchblade?
---
There's a walljump you can do, it's a really long walk above the world to get into uninstanced AQ.
---
UD rogues must be the horde-version of Gnome rogues because every one of those sonsabitches I see ganks or tries to gank me regardless of their level.
---
thats actually pretty good ... better than the asshole rogue ganking at marshal point
---
If it's really a deal breaker not having an instant damage ability, you can go destruction for shadowburn. Your open world solo leveling will suffer for it, but if you mainly level in dungeons that is minimized.
---
Bugged bugs? What is this a bethesda game?
---
Heartseeker is 4 to 1 alliance because of transfers. Way to completely fuck what was once a nearly balances server, blizzard.
---
My friend is leveling arcane, but he‚Äôs dying a lot and has a tough time keeping mobs from hitting him.  It seems like he‚Äôs mostly smashing arcane missiles with a wand or two between casts.  
---
Is arcane viable to level with or should he consider a different tree?  
---
I tank dungeons for him, but if he‚Äôs just out questing I‚Äôm getting a lot of feedback that he‚Äôs dying or having difficulty.
---

Have 1H, Frequent, Negative, Villian. Interested in Lie
---
Interested in Bone
---
I'm tired of playing solo. Looking for a stable small to mid size guild that is active in chat and helps each other out.
---
Willing to reroll and start over on other servers as I can't seem to find what I'm looking for on Benediction. Prefer east coast servers. I will fill whatever role you need.
---
TLDR: multiboxing isn't against the rules, deal with it.
---
Since hunter skills have static damage and I think I do more white damage anyway, Is it Worth it to Max all their ranks before lvl 60?
---
You probably know this but you get your deposit back if the item sells, so having it for 24 hours doesnt cost you extra should the item sell.
---
a shame it isn't
---
You want retail?  Go play retail.  This constant complaining is how we got to that state.  Everyone wants little "fixes" but then we end up with a retail mess.
---
Good to know, thanks for the reply!
---
Nah, man, happy for you!
---
It was just that the hunter won it that killed a little piece of my soul.
---
It took 3 adventures to that troll area to do the first quest there...it was a battleground all 3 times, and damn it was fun.
---
Check out Captain Grim.  He has some rather good videos as well.
---
Hi, /u/Matjo2200

---
How are servers making these newspapers? I think they‚Äôre awesome and would like to see if Whitemane has one.
---
honestly, give your build a try. Maybe do some dungeons. Will it be as efficient as 2h fury? No, not at all. But who cares? Maybe you'll like it. and if you really don't you can always respec.
---
Battelgrounds already killed world pvp, people just blamed flying mounts.
---
The edgemaster's are only BiS if you have a base skill of 300 or if they are necessary to push you over 308 weapon skill, if you're a human you're getting enough from maladath in BWL, so it's a situational item. For a lot of players the steep cost of both edgemaster's and the fact that you also need cloudkeepers to push it beyond devilsaur incase you play orc, I bet most players will stick with devilsaur.
---
I think it's possible you find a raid spot as enhance, but itd be pretty rare and you'd probably need nightfall axe. I swapped to ele at 40 so I only need one set of gear and at 60 I'll most likely heal raids
---
Need a priest to throw a bubble on it
---
Lock 3 mages and a priest
---
This also translates to Reddit which is why you see much more pro-Horde, anti-Alliance stuff being posted and upvoted here.
---
He's the guy who gives you the ring in the first place, from his perch in LBRS.
---
FD+trap works but you need to put your pet to passive before you use FD.
---
And even then, its spotty. Def. needs work
---
If you were the first mage on your server to get to level 25ish and stayed ahead of the pack for the first week, yes it was a lot faster.
---
Correct. Our raid has too many healers. Most of my healing comes through flash heal.
---
Cookie‚Äôs Cove, where we only use the BEST EVOO in our 30-minute sammies!
---
It's entirely possible they assume your camping is justified after that, thinking you're just a ganker lashing out after being punished.
---
It's fun, but on a pvp server, I miss iceblock and ice barrier so much.
---
Yeah, I keep having to tell people that water is expensive. If you decide to start the pull before I'm done drinking, just make sure you have enough HP to last until there's at least 5s left on my drink. Unless I have mage water, then I'll happily interrupt my drinking whenever.
---
Something can have both a niche and passionate fanbase at the same time
---
DMT better watch out, might summon joe rogan with that spam in the chat.
---
Any Alliance Weaponsmith on Windseeker server willing to craft a Phantom Blade for me? Mats + tip or just gold
---
Yes, rockbiter gives more damage per second. It is actually best till 60. Windfury is much more fun though
---
Level 50.5 rogue finished quests through tanaris. Heading to hinterlands then searing gorge.
---
When should i start grinding dungeons for BiS and whats the first step?
---
It will get better  from now on! :)
---
It was VC on Rexxar and Feathermoon
---
just personal choice, I played on full server until transfer at level 45, on earthfury Ive gotten more for my materials, many more friendly interactions, and pvp has been a lot more fun. Dont regret it at all
---
Also not as many min/maxers people seem to try different odd builds
---
This is only for casts, not dot dmg right?
---
Opposing factions on a PvE server aren't your enemy by default...
---
My 6yo killed his first other faction last night as a lvl24 mage. Some dumb 19priest gave him a go. He was so excited. 
---
Never been prouder tbh.
---
As a shadow priest if I can get a fear off it's over. I beat a 51 hunter today as a 45 spriest. He dropped down right next to me in a cave. Viper sting sucks but if I can fear into mindblast/mindflay then the hunter will die before my mana is gone anyway
---
Considering the number of people LFG to run SM without specifying a wing, I disbelieve.
---
Which kind of druid? :)
---
Don't worry about it.  Low level dungeons don't matter as long as you clear.  Shadow priests can do pretty good single target damage, but threat is always an issue.  You will always lose total damage - as others stated get your own and watch boss fights.
---
If Druid tanking is being taken seriously, then I know what my next alt is, right now I main a warrior and have a paladin I‚Äôm working on.

10+ below....

Or maybe 10 levels below

Or maybe  -10 levels

Hi everyone, I'm looking for a guild on Incendius (H) or Grobbulus (A).  I'm leveling so I'm willing to reroll because finding a good guild for the long haul is worth a couple weeks lost.  The classes I'm leveling are Hunter (H &amp;A), Warlock (H&amp;A), Druid (A) and Shaman.  I played a disc priest &amp; MT during vanilla and I played hunter &amp; death knight in more modern xpacs.  I'm a semi hardcore or "midcore" player in that I play a lot more than I should.  I'm on the East coast with a "normal" schedule, but either coast works as latency seems to be nice on either.
---
What I'm looking for: an established semi hardcore guild that uses DKP/similar point system on a high + populated server.  I'd prefer a fun atmosphere and to play with low drama adults.
---
I have a headset/discord, mic &amp; can stream/record.
---
Please PM me here or respond if you'd like to chat or have a question.
---
[Scum Class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPfF1IfuVnc)
---
If you're really threat-starved early into a fight but aren't going to be trashed very hard, you can also unequip and reequip some pieces of +stamina gear before entering combat to lower your HP, maximizing healing threat. Useful when LoS'ing casters, just make sure your healer knows what you're doing.
---
A few of the larger races cant nook, notably male ne, and tauren. As for lava jump it takes practice, youbgotta be at the height of your jump when it ticks.
---
Ya, no, Peacemaker is BiS for Hunters until Phase 5 when the Agi Enchants come out.
---
Any Hunter rolling on Dal'Rends is just un-informed or an asshole.
---
Always neck. Lasts longer. You‚Äôll get laughed out of capital cities if you take the trinket.
---
Phase 3
---
My guild has a bear tank offtank and it works really well. If you get crowd pummeler, feral tank can be really great for phase 3 onyxia, too.
---
I like how you are being downvoted by these snot nosed punks who were still pissing their pants when vanilla was out.
---
It was absolutely DM until Dire Maul came out.  Then it became VC.  Anyone telling you it was VC on their server before Dire Maul was released is misremembering.
---
The solution: 
---
Everyone use invulnerability pots as she comes down in p3 besides the tank...you're welcome.
---
I'm pretty sure it's a helix particle effect that spirals up from the character. OP just happened to catch it in a spot where the helix looks like an arrow.
---
im resto druid how the fuck do i outheal priests
---
The only hunter that has beat me used all beastmaster cds and engaged when I was half mana. If I'm ready for the fight a beastmaster still pushes me to my mana limits but not nearly as much. Leveling alch so I can make antivenom. Once I can clear viper sting off I dont think they will stand a chance
---
Situational answer to this question. There are a few guides out there about it. In general slow weapon -&gt; rockbiter (2h staff/axe) and fast weapon -&gt; flametongue (dagger/shield). Group content you'll likely want to go with flametongue to not pull aggro from your tank.
---
If you‚Äôre a DPS looking for a dungeon run, you don‚Äôt have time to shift-click a name. If you don‚Äôt respond immediately, it‚Äôs ‚Äúsorry, all full.‚Äù
---
2x2h wasn‚Äôt introduced until the WOTLK pre patch at the very end of TBC.
---
That water beneath the boat is 95% Alliance tears.
---
Fairly open to Druid roles, but in need of Resto. What are you looking to do in raids?
---
How does a fresh lvl 60 have 900g????? Is that normal?
---
emberseer (internal level 60) and drakkisath (internal level 62) were both flagged as bosses in vanilla (lvl ??) but you didnt hit them the same as the only thing that matters was the internal level of the enemy (boss status does NOT matter)
---
Nope. Hands of the Exalted Harald, Whipvine Cord, and Burial Shawl are definitely much better than their corresponding Tier 1 pieces. 
---
What do you need much mana reg for? Most fights in MC won't last longer than 2 minutes. I'd take more +healing (and drink a mana potion every fight) over mana reg any day.
---
Or just call it VC
---
I've been browsing this sub since classic launched and now I understand how blizzard could have turned classic into retail. people like those on this sub asked for it.
---
Aren‚Äôt those the same as ice block in that they only reduce threat for the duration of the potion?
---
It's BiS for Hunter with +Agi, correct. 
---
Except +Agi isn't available until P5. Until then, Peacemaker is better. Hunters rolling on Dal'Rends are blindly following BiS lists or just being selfish.
---
You don‚Äôt need to have a pike to be able to zap ogres, only one person needs to combine the pike and head then anyone can click on it
---
What do you mean are these real? I'll have you know I'm the most often /w'ed tank in my entire realm, and I've been involved in numerous raids on Onyxia, and I have over 300 confirmed world pvp kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the most geared woyer on the entirety of Ashbringer-Eu. You are nothing to me but just another target of my Berserking. I will darkspear you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on azeroth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying this shit on this sub? Think again fucker. as we speak I am contacting my network of battle net friends across NA and EU regions and your character name is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime and I can gank you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my in-combat Troll regeneration. Not only am I extensively trained in *unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the horde and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continents, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.*
---
I get this when I tell groups that I‚Äôm not spec‚Äôd for aoe (didn‚Äôt take permafrost or imp blizzard) instead I‚Äôm spec‚Äôd for single target. I get that it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot as efficient‚Äù but I‚Äôve always been a ‚Äúdps on boss is what matters‚Äù kinda person, and I‚Äôm already having to slow my leveling to allow my friends to keep pace. 
---
As long as your spec choice isn‚Äôt causing wipes (lvling it shouldn‚Äôt be) fuck em. Play how you like, and just laugh it off that people are too scared to stray from the meta in a 15 year old game.
---
Ghost wolf
---
I mean we have people who just say "LF dungeon" too.
---
This didn't end the way I expected at all. Good on you man
---
I think it's just the way when time passes and people grow older. Like for now I would really like to raid again, at least like 1 or 2 evenings a week. But with a child and a pregnant wife at home it's just not possible anymore. Maybe in 2 or 3 years. So for now I just enjoy classic again and am happy to meet some old faces :) I really met people I haven't talked to for more than 10 years.
---
I mean, hes right in that the forums dont make the rules...
---
They do however they do a pretty good job of *Explaining* the rules.

---
They are all about the same DPS boost and comes down to player choice. One exception is that WF can be helpful because it gives extra chances to proc Flurry. Other than than (or before you get WF) it depends more on what you're fighting. 
---
High armor targets, Use Flametounge. 
---
Want to dodge aggro? Flametounge. 
---
Mobs run away? Try Frost. Less mana intensive than hitting them with Frost Shock. 
---
Generally, Rockbiter is helpful because it's a consistent source of dps so your rotation isn't affected as much by procs.
---
Alternatively, you can save a bit of money by only leveling one enhancement because it won't matter in most situations.
---
FarieFire now what?
---
No I don't play:) just thought it was relevant for any readers/applicants:)
---
I saw a rogue we picked up as a 5th for our Mara run the next day randomly. We both /wave'd. I really missed that kind of stuff in the game.
---
Eventually (I think level 42), you'll get Death coil which is an instant cast drain life on a cooldown.  There's also shadowburn if you spec into it, and speccing into nightfall will give you the chance to proc instant cast shadowbolts.  So if you stick it out and want it enough to spec into it, instant damage is available.
---
60 and bored. Admittedly my own fault. Gives me time to check out other games and see what's up in retail.
---
I farmed 40 in 2 and a half hours on my server. I kept track of 5-6 Devilsaur spawns. Their spawn rate is between 11-16 minutes and all have exact spawning locations so it is definitely doable. Some are farming up to 30 an hour.
---
I feel you. I think a lot of people feel the same way about Scarlet Monastary too. I spent waaay too long in there myself.
---
Yes that is true!
---
Can you help me feel better about rolling a male troll hunter vs a orc?
---
Not sure but we have used them the past 4 weeks and have had 0 deaths or issues since doin it...2g a piece to get one is a small price to pay for a clean one shot.
---
It was VC on Nathrezim back in the day, though I started in like 1.11.
---
Big brain comment...
---
I actually Lol'd  
---
Take your upvote
---
In addition to what others have already said:
---
Inspiration reduces rep grinds.
---
Stoneform removes debuffs during boss fights.
---
Paladins get 10 seconds of invulnerability for tank healing purposes, not to mention Salvation and Protection blessings trivializing aggro issues with bosses like Onyxia.
---
Even Wisp Form gets you back to another attempt sooner while doing progression.
---
Also not a racial, but Alliance also gets to use things like the glass marble and the seal of Elune.
---
I don't remember enchanting being so insanely rough. Can't wait to go back to Uldaman to train again... level 58 and enchanting 235 smh
---
Noob here, what does MSBT stand for?
---
Yeah that's the ultimate move for sure
---
Gl fighting over owl beasts tags!
---
Woo rare Akama player!
---
Shazzrah has a self-buff that reduces magical damage taken by 50%. It should be dispelled by Dispel Magic or Purge. A WA can detect when Shazzrah gains this buff.
---
Thats so cruel, and such a great idea!

I am 60 now with close to 200 hours in a pvp server. There has been exactly one occurrence of an alliance player attacking me in a "fair fight" (he was 3 lvls higher). Noone (me neither) attacks on equal ground from what I can tell and I am not really surprised. With HK I expect there to be way more pvp 1v1 as well.
---
Yeah if I wasnt so far progressed in both I'd definitely swap but that is only because I realized a bit too late that wont be getting any important recipes right away from raids yet due to not being the "dedicated tailor/chanter".
---
So make a tank
---
Loser and/or lazy mentality. It's nowhere near that bad unless you're asking at 5AM.
---
I was thinking something like this
---
[Arms / Fury](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/0530502030201-0505000550500005)
---
I mostly tank dungeons with 2h and if necessary switching to 1h + Shield, I wonder how the above talents work with my rotation below ?
---
Charge - Blood rage - Sweeping Strikes - Berserker stance - Berserker Rage - Whirwind
---
After this point according to composition, my health, healer mana and according to other variables, I continue with Berserker and Whirlwind or I switch to 1h + Shield and Shield Block, If single target remains i occasionally Dual Wield etc.
---
 The idea is to maximize my damage threat rage etc, to hold aggro against mages and high dps.
---
Yea because horde never does that üôÑ
---
I need to buy one just to do this now.
---
It literally doesn't matter for raids. The +healing means you cast fewer heals, which means you use less mana. You also have more time between heals, which is more time in mp5 and less need for the extra spirit (even if you have 25% of your spirit becoming +healing anyway).
---
Basically none of priest T1 is BIS. It's fine/good if you don't already have other stuff but there's a lot better out there, including just picking up stuff with absurd +healing and nothing else.
---
My wife was getting frustrated here and there. So I had to pick and choose when it was right for me to give her a hint or tell her how to do something. Telling her about numlock auto run and M for map, so far, were very good bits of advice lol
---
If I'm pulling when the healer is oom it's because I don't need heals. Just attack the skull and enjoy the ride.
---
wow defo a missed opportunity here
---
you the best, thank you!
---
Priority = Resto &gt; Boomkin (only 1 in raids)
---
Your goal is always to reduce overhealing, because that's wasted mana (this is of course less relevant on tanks taking heavy damage)
---
In dungeons you won't be getting heals sniped, so any overhealing is your own fault.
---
In raids, there's typically not much healing to be done because dps is so much higher and fights don't last that long.
---
So it's better for all the healers to sprinkle in heals to avoid overhealing unless there's some actual burst healing to be done.
---
Druids specifically like R4 healing touch because it's a half second faster cast time which means you can triage better and not get sniped all the time
---
I have a similar screenie but of furbolgs kneeling
---
in VC (Deadmines) towards the end when you get on the boat there is a BIG Wheel on the side. You can jump on the wheel and get out of combat/stop attackers. Great for wipes, have the healer run to the wheel then rez when safe.
---
You're kinder than I am. I had to kill "Pretty Boy Duncan" outside of Booty Bay for a quest yesterday. I had pulled two of the mages surrounding him over to me to finish clearing the way over to him, and a mage comes in trotting along on his mount and tags the boss that I just spent 3 plus minutes clearing a way to. I asked him to invite me, of course he didn't, and he left...
---
Boy, I was heated.
---
I wouldn't sell it for anything less than 3k. Btw what mob dropped it?
---
yup, definitely stopped reading at this line.
---
That's why I went stonetalon, decolece, feralas
---
Everyone should run kick bars
---
I mean, you could just as easily fill your group with classes who cannot equip your drop. That worked very well for me until I was full BiS at which point I started charging 1-2 righteous orbs a strat.
---
Doing pretty damn well now.
---
&gt; it doesn't break the game in any meaningful way to leave it in
---
layering does. Why I made this modifier.
---
How do yall not understand that he is ALLIANCE and wants a Horde to purchase this for him? Hence why he is looking for a Horde who can help him.
---
When random chance effects activate (programmed random occurance)
---
Got some okay gear. I've got a few +spell damage items I am going to throw on once I cross level 34. Everything else is just +spirit and +int
---
Can two locks not complete it at the same time?
---
Im still leveling so I havent been testing equip macros, but dont on-use items trigger a 30 second cd on equip? 
---
So you would have to have SoID already equipped at the time of engagment.
---
I was hoping I could get in touch with someone who played classic a long time ago with them.  Me and my buddies raided with them.  My buddy who got me into wow played with them through naxx and passed a few years back.  Seeing the Afterlife tag brought back a flood of memories.  
---
If there is anyone still in afterlife playing that knew Jeny the dwarf priest please put them in touch with me.
---
Southern Barrens as Ally. Western Ungoro can be bad too
---
\*\*Priest Farming Dire Maul East\*\*
---
Is Improved Inner Fire a necessary talent?  Guides seem to be mixed on this.  I would rather not have it for raiding purposes if its superfluous.  Thanks!
---
My bank alt is a level 5 in Org on a PVE server and I keep him flagged just for fun. Well the other day a rogue must have been hanging out in org. He 1 shotted me in the bank, then vanished from sight. lol
---
ok maybe that's not the worst by your definition, but it was pretty fucking funny and jarring at the same time dying like that in your faction's main city
---
I wish they would've kept the multiple platforms.
---
Calvin Coolidge was a great friend of mine
---
My Rogue friend respecced to Daggers just to stop farming these things.
---
It's like the guy I met in Durotar that said "you don't need to group to play this game" when I tried to group up for a kill quest.
---
It's like they don't know what the second M in MMO stands for.
---
Oh no did I offend you? Lmao
---
How is that any different than say, only inviting casters so you get all the melee drops? No roll competition is just reserving with extra steps.
---
&gt;Also on those aoe pulls easiest way for druids to do the strat aoe packs if you have reasonable gear is to pull with fairy fire, Los stack them into barkskin +hurricane then bear to clean up the elites.
---
its the preferred way as soon as you get hurricane tho in any instance :P
---
Which add-on are you using for your unit frame?
---
That's what I was thinking. I was just thinking maybe an increase in dog would help me level!
---
I feel if your guild isn't the MOST serious, just a good ol' roll -1 or +1 system can work just wonders. Basically, everyone just rolls on shit, and if you win, you can't roll before everyone else also has won within what kind of item you got (so if you rolled on mage set, and won, you can't roll on mage set items before all the other mages have won 1)
---
Sure, it's not perfect. But as I think MOST people are agreeing on here, no system IS. And IMO, in the end it's all about findign a system that works for YOU and your guild.
---
I led a guild in Legion and we had a LCouncil, and whilst it was incredibly fair, it was still quite a lot of work always knowing what stats are used for what class and spec etcetc. And not only that, but having to keep notes on who had gotten loot previously etcetc.
---
Very north West plague lands,   Can‚Äôt recall name of scarlet  town
---
Funny and sad at the same time, the reserve bullshit is getting out of hand. Reserve seems to be the new "layer me pls"
---
Had a run with a tank who felt he was doing a bad job, he was actually great. He was under the impression that he had to hold aggro on each and very mob, a mob with 5% HP is gonna get killed by the group. Don't sweat the small stuff like one random mob getting away. We got our tools as well, as a mage i can freeze and sheep. Once the group confirmed he was doing great and no need to stress he played much more relaxed.
---
A great metaphor on what is happening with wars and conflicts all over the world irl
---
Thing is most mages pull aggro and would die if I didn't emergency heal them. Having to res/wait for them to run back is just more time wasted.
---
Lol true. That was the first one I've seen...
---
Omg undead mages. So true.
---
I have a Quest for you to get me something out of the D.
---
I started early TBC and on my server (NA - Echo Isles) it was called DM.
---
The middle east troll area in stv below the elite ogres. You run all the way up from booty bay and have to go past it because of the mountains and then back down around into it.
---
Elune NA and it was VC... Trollbane NA was VC as well (although technically Trollbane didn't open until the first day of TBC.)
---
This is my consideration as well.
---
Ah I see - so casting healbombs is more efficient for mana, which is why in dungeons that's the way to go.
---
With multiple healers, gross mana efficiency **isn't** the main priority, since so much is lost to overhealing that the net mana efficiency is actually lower. By down-ranking and casting small, cheap heals you can find a middle ground where you're not healing as much as you **can** but you're mitigating a good amount of the overhealing caused by multiple healers?
---
Miks scrolling battle text It's an addon

Vendor.
---
I spawned to get one shot again. He must have not liked my name. Stv is the only area I have quests in at my level. Everywhere else stuff is red so I‚Äôm trying to knock them out. I‚Äôve left stv like 6 times because of ganking.
---
Who would ever do that? Makes no sense
---
Are you sure? Even dots shouldn't work it needs to be a direct damaging spell
---
southern STV because the GY is all the way north of nesingwary camp.
---
Mages also have detect magic for this
---
I'm 46 myself and was thinking of either waiting until 59 for pure dungeon farming, or switching a little earlier for DM East farming.  I am having trouble finding great Classic guides on DM East farming though.
---
Can u search for multiple items at once?  That‚Äôs what I don‚Äôt know how to do
---
Ask asmongold to lead another raid into Ogrimmar and go with

Source?
---
Go to Settings to activate Windows
---
I played on Elune (launch day server) we called it VC.
---
This would have been infinitely more funny if you faced him into the directions of mobs.
---
Frost is good at all content, PvE, PvP, farming, raid. It‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so popular.
---
Joke's on you.  I misclick players, stealthed or not, instead of NPCs in Booty Bay all the time due to how crowded it is.
---
What's RMT?
---
There are plenty of non weird ones. Luke (Skywalker), Mary (Poppins), Harry (Potter), James (Bond), etc..
---
YOLO SHOWLO
---
In all seriousness, got an IRL friend that prounounces it like "Showlomance" and I scream this into the mic every time. 
---
He still hasn't caught on.
---
Good thing most people wait till you're mid combat with an npc to engage huh.
---
Maybe, maybe noch :D
---
Defintely should go frost, just google a build and choose a single target one.  It would be night and day for him.  Arcane is very squishy and mana driven.  It's not a great spec minus a fire/arcane hybrid.
---
You mean the Argent Dawn Trinket?
---
I've only done dungeons as tank, at level 58 now. Maybe I've just been lucky but I've never had anyone say anything negative
---
If they meant phase 2, they would have said "phase 2".
---
Nahh, the reason I have hs in Kargath is to save time, not to waste even more of it
---
&gt; People were knowledgeable back in the day, too
---
The average wow player back then was a complete and utter uninformed noob compared to the average classic player.
---
Sure, there will be more thorium,... available, but there will also be much more gold in the economy as well (hunters can solo the ogre event, locks can farm elites, rogues can pickpocket,...) I believe (and banked a lot of mats on it) that despite the increase in mats, the influx of raw gold will still make overall prices go up.
---
Repost of a repost
---
Maybe it was just me but we kept having issues of people leaving during ‚ÄúFull runs‚Äù. I‚Äôd recommend using the key to go straight to Anger/Golem area and go from there for Emperor run. 
---
That being said, I‚Äôve heard people say they‚Äôve done it at 54, but I waited until 59 before I did the princess quest. 56 is probably high enough. 
---
Best of luck!
---
This for sure! Even if you don‚Äôt get AOE groups the exp is awesome and if you are on a PvP servers it also takes that out of the leveling equation.
---
Some people have extreme social anxiety that is prevalent even in online games.  The act of grouping up puts pressure on them and makes them uncomfortable.  Just be kind and move on as the person may not be an ass even if they seem like it at first.
---
Stuff like this reminds me of either of the Division titles. You'll be in a base trying to craft gear and sort items and its just the same conversation wavs over and over every 40 seconds. Like,  holy shit, give it a rest for a few minutes
---
1-50 = 50 (0 isn't a roll), 51-100 (100 is a roll) = 50. So if he wanted a fifty-fifty, he should kill (it?) himself
---
Yeah I‚Äôve seen that. The worst. 
---
The biggest thing I don‚Äôt understand is that in my experience only hunters will tend to just start pulling stuff on their own. No other class will just start doing that.  Maybe it‚Äôs cause that‚Äôs one of their traditional roles in a raid? Maybe the feign death. Idk. But they‚Äôll just shooting or start sending their pet into mobs intentionally.  They‚Äôll dps a mob before I get aggro. And then they‚Äôll have their pet tank the mob away from the others, thus draining the healers mana keeping the pet up. Theyll use multishot poorly and randomly, pulling adds. They won‚Äôt drink between pulls, even when there‚Äôs free water.  So they are constantly empty on mana. Their dps will often be shit. They roll on a lot of random stuff.  They are strangely passive aggressive, saying weird shit to argue with what others are saying. Almost like they resent that they need a tank or that they need anybody.  I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs just this weird trend I get only with hunters. 
---
Again majority of hunters are awesome, just like the majority of players I‚Äôve grouped with have been awesome. But it always seems to be that when there‚Äôs that random jackass every so often, it‚Äôs always a hunter.
---
I tried so hard to stay in Kalimdor while leveling my horde toon. But the truth is, outside of The Barrens, there aren't any zones that have a plethora of quests. I finally made the trip out to STV and got two levels probably twice as fast as switching between thousand needles, Dustwallow, Tanaris, and Feralas.
---
You can do this with most critters and it will keep you in combat so rage won't decay
---
hey im right there with you. which wolf did you go with. i went purple eye boy
---
I'm new to the game but I'm assuming this makes it so you talk to NPCs with left click instead of right? So you keep attack on right click and avoid accidentally attacking members of the enemy faction that are doing this sort of thing?
---
We'll see! You're absolutely correct in saying that BWL and AQ have more difficult mechanics then MC or Ony, but they're still not difficult to understand by any means. More effort will have to be put into coordinating and educating PUGs, but I honestly haven't met that many players in Classic that are brand new to the game, or to raiding, so I have faith groups can get through it.
---
And then your melee dps gets fucking clobbered.
---
For a full run, 57 would be best since end boss is 59. But realistically 55+ should be fine.
---
There are a ton of healers at 60 but I've noticed that almost all of them are terrible
---
Make a macro that swaps between the two and hit it every couple seconds
---
No, just call Deadmines DM as it has been forever and Dore Maul either DiM or specify the wing via DME/DMW etc.
---
Resto shamys are incredibly strong in raids. Ideally you want 50/50 resto/priests. Finding good restos is hard, though. Every shaman seems to want to play ele or enhancer. Too bad both specs are absolutely useless in raids (maybe you can bring a totem swapping enhancer with nightfall, which is coming in p3).
---
https://youtu.be/szkScab2iOQ?t=1909 That is incorrect advice that is not supported by DPS analysis.
---
How old is the term "yoink"?  Do we know it's first use?  I was 11 when the first Doom was released, and I spontaneously used the term, having never heard of it before.
---
Originally describing the art of disengaging from a better armed deathmatch opponent until you found something better than a handgun ("yoink" : high pitched, typically accompanied by zigging and zagging), It later changed to looting, typically reserved for dropped or high level gear ("Yoink" : Smug)
---
It spread (locally) among people i know.  I'm assuming it was in use far earlier than that?
---
Can you put together a guide for Devilsaur farming on Faerlina?
---
Depends on your gear, skill level, and willingness to use consumables.
---
I would say 55 min with a good group, 57 preferred so Emperor is still yellow.
---
Been awhile since I tanked it though, could be overestimating difficulty.
---
LOL.  Yeah...
---
When I did it our group was saying there a way around the bug but you have to defend him an extra 20 mins. But he worked correctly for us, which was weird
---
&gt;Tanks switch target every second. How do I know which is the correct one?
---
General target priority. Healer &gt; Dangerous Crowd Control &gt; Caster &gt; Melee DPS &gt; Melee Tank.  
---
Knowing what enemies do in the dungeon is important to tackling pulls effectively. A good group doesn't need target marking to know what to do, just focus on the highest priority target with the lowest health during the burn phase and you'll always be right.  
---
The tank shouldn't be picking targets based on personal preference. There's a rationale to which targets need to be downed first.
---
Any raid worth their salt will not take you as DPS. If they do, you will be carried hard by your raid. No offense, but a single, fresh 60 frost mage could probably put out 10x the DPS you could.
---
I think that could work to Maybe go farm solo or as a DPS in a 5 man though since you could easily double as an off healer.
---
It's proc'ing off any Hostile action from someone reporting back with the BoRD, ALONG with Mind Vision, which is both annoying and abusable.
---
Just because my mage is main, doesnt mean i dont also have a prot warrior. Threat is a basic concept if it's hard for you maybe its a lack of experience on your part.
---
&gt; Priests using sheild too early is an issue too
---
PW:S on a tank is always wrong, unless the tanks would have died without it.
---
Sometimes I will be soloing a mob, run away from where I pulled the mob, but because I Vanish the same time it hits me with an auto attack I instantly leave and enter.
---
 Noticed this kinda thing happening a lot with the ‚Äúlatency compensation‚Äù system or whatever it‚Äôs called. For example killing a mob the same time it kills you when both are melee, or stunning/Gouging each other at the same time, etc.
---
Actually, he should appear for both epic class quests (Hunter &amp; Priest) I believe. Evidence from back in LK :  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOxsBoUEJEk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOxsBoUEJEk) 
---
Unless it was changed between 1.12 and later expansions :o
---
What professions do you have on each?
---
I'm pretty sure classic Wowhead is just scrubbing data from this version of the game - droprates for lots of items are completely fucked up and stuff like enemy health is removed at this point. I think they pulled some old template that didnt retain droprate and specific enemy data and have been just bulding that back up.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/basics-to-keybinding-in-wow ez keybinds
---
Only ever played dungeons as tank actually, at level 58 now. Never had anyone say anything negative, not just about me but about any other member in the run.
---
Sorry to smash your dreams but Holy Nova is really, really bad. Max Rank HNova is less healing and costs more mana than Rank 1 Prayer of Healing. The spell coefficient on HNova is butts too, worse than PW Shield's.
---
It's really good for dank memes though, like trying to beat the tank in DPS on AOE pulls before you go OOM.
---
You know you want the D
---
I tanked my first full run at 52 dinged 53 before Emp. This was not easy and I had a 60 priest healing. Threat gen do to missing was the biggest problem.
---
As a pally you've got Hand and Judge. You've got insane base AA threat. Not to mention a fricken INVULNERABILITY SHIELD. If a dps rips aggro from you unintentionally, you can get it back. Don't use judgement on every cooldown and you might re-aquire threat sometimes.
---
Now everything I said is reliant on the dps having thumbs and being able to read. If this isn't the case, then it's not really a problem to solve by tanking *poorly*
---
Right before the end of the in dreams escort
---
Dore Maul sounds like a pretty funny dungeon.
---
Did anybody said...THUNDERFURY, BLESSED BLADE OF THE WINDSEEKER??????
---
I prefer to kill stuff solo for xp and loot if there's plenty of mobs to share but never would I do that with a named mob and definitely never when someone else also needs it! That's just rude.
---
Haven't seen any on the AH on my server, but you can get a pretty accurate price by just doing ( (Market Price of Arcanite Bars) * 20 ) which roughly equals to 1300 gold on my server.
---
Wut? DKP is the WORST system for guild it causes nothing but problem.
---
1. You have to trust who ever is keeping the logs, or you have to make everyone keep their own logs and constantly cross reference them which just creates problems
---
2. People will often save DKP for one specific item and not take upgrades which is just a waste of loot.
---
3. New recruits usually end up in negative DKP very quickly because they are forced to take loot (which just defeats the purpose of the system).
---
Is that only for the AD trinket? I assumed these two issues were related
---
40 seconds is pretty long. Pretty sure most groups kill him in less than 10.
---
There are excellent boots dropping in Sunken Temple. After that you want to weave in more and more BRD runs until you get your HoJ.
---
Heh, I would imagine so eh! I'll just fix that.. ;p
---
Jokes on you my moms dead
---
dudes the man carebears
---
Too early to tell. Trial and error will be the step needed once DM is out
---
\&gt;Shadowpriest the Holy Priest has entered the chat.
---
I can assure you 2h are lacking of weapons too... :D Try AH in search of good weapons.
---
if you want to be able to keep up you'll have to go full shadow spec at 40 and even then you'll still likely be last in dps. classic is a bitch sometimes and some specs aren't as good as others
---
Another day another tank-whine thread ... such is the rule for r/classicwow. I tanked while leveling and at 60 and I got almost no complaints and lots of friend requests. Truth is a slow/bad tank can be very annoying.
---
I haven't heard of priests farming DM:T but I could totally be wrong, if you have any videos or anything I'd be interested.
---
We should be able to farm DME lashers, and I've heard people say that they are able to do it in pretty much any holy nova build with 6k~ish mana but I've heard other people say you need PI. I'm planning on waiting a week or so for other people to test it, see if I need to respec, and then grind out hopefully enough gold for my epic mount in a week or two.
---
"A dragon will appear." Dude it's Vael.
---
Thanks for the advice I didn't know Thrash Blade stays relevant all the way to raiding. I should have enchanted it right away when I got it.
---
What about a weapon chain? I hate being disarmed.
---
I don‚Äôt understand the desire for a key ring.
---
Part of what I enjoy about classic wow is that it is tuned towards character management and group play.  
---
With all of the keys, you have a bank to put unused keys in, or in your group/guild you assign who has the key to which places.
---
This also added a fun bit of RP into the game for me as I had background stories for why I had my specific keys.
---
It's the biggest reason my guild is struggling for players. People are only raidlogging and everyone is like "Why even bother BWL in around 6 monts is not gonna change much in terms of difficulty".
---
I predict this being the reason the game will die out soonish, even for my casual friends doing 1h30min MC runs isn't keeping them interested.
---
Once the majority is 60 people will leave the game fast, the content is too trivial for casuals even.
---
I can‚Äôt find these crystals for the life of me... -.-
---
How are tanks in so high demand? I‚Äôm level 22 warrior and considering a new toon because I see warriors everywhere!!
---
Sounds like we need a fix and rollback
---
Thank you. I rolled a priest and it‚Äôs my first healing class. Would this be useful to see your heals in dungeons?  I‚Äôm currently using the blizzard standard scrolling combat text but I haven‚Äôt really found it that useful.
---
Wait, so when I tanked him at 58 a few days ago he should have been *easier* to hit? Shit, I was having an awful time getting stuff to land!
---
GNOMED
---
Probably sometime around mid-late Q1 2020. This isn't official or anything but just my best guess based on the pacing of releases and what Blizzard has said so far.
---
BGs will be released with Phase 3. We are in Phase 1, and the release of Phase 2 is sometime Nov or Dec 2019. So I'm figuring 2-3 months after Phase 2 release.
---
?? When you hover over them

100%. Til they realize that the other faction quits, it won't be addressed.
---
I don't understand, why are you downvoting me?
---
You don't do MC to gear for MC so I think it's fair to not optimize around 45 second fights.
---
Here's a spreadsheet with weights based on some observations over a bunch of different fights, I believe it's based on 3 minute durations. There's a link to a long discussion in the last tab.

From what I have read, once the event is done locks can join the group and speak to the npc to complete their quest.

It's WeakAuras for the rather large no pet and abilities in the middle of the screen. I'm also using Plater Nameplates &amp; Real Mob Health
---
44 Druid, 270 skinning/250 herbalism.
---
I had planned on dropping skinning at 300, after collecting enough devilsaur to get pieces I need for my feral build, for alchemy.  I have all my herbs saved/banked so I can powerlevel to 300 alchemy.
---
As time goes on, however, I'm noticing engineering is pretty "lit" and hard not to take for both PvP and PvE.
---
Wtf should I do?  I really want to become an alchemist but my alts are 23 warlock (max mining/engineering already as he was a planned pvp character) and 10 priest (max tailor/enchanting).  I'm not sure I have the time to get an alt to level 35 to max out alchemy and also get my druid to 60 (and druid is my priority right now).
---
Would dropping skinning/herbalism for engineering/alchemy at 60 be smart or am I going to suffer in alchemy by not having herbalism?
---
To add, you could say you're ganking someone when he/she is not at all expecting to be attacked. Pvp is when its really obvious that there's going to be a duel (making sure the other party saw you, isn't half hp/mana, overall giving them a fighting chance). World pvp is when you have multiple people fighting multiple people with a somewhat equal power balance.
---
Obviously, nobody is saying it's a bad server or people shouldn't play there or anything like that. It's personal choice where you play and what you prefer, nobody was ever questioning that.
---
Objectively when compared to higher pop servers though it seems very dead. That's all.
---
I didnt have problems with the quest, maybe its bugged on the realm/layer you're on?
---
You can think of it like a dude flipping burgers on the only one man grill in the restaurant. Adding another person to the task doesn't help unless you're prepared and go through a lengthy process of adding another grill, which could actually slow the original burger flipper down due to the construction. Only a bug isn't ever as simple as flipping a burger, more like a complex puzzle where you don't really know exactly you'll finish it. The grill is knowledge and the burger flipper is whatever dev has sunk a bunch of time into fixing this thing.
---
Also, if he flips a burger there's a chance that the other burgers that he already made will disappear. Fixing a single bug can lead to unintended consequences elsewhere and even if it doesn't you still have to test to make sure it doesn't do anything worse than what's already in.
---
Is this all a dumb metaphor? Yes, but here it is.
---
Do it right when the servers come up.  Only solution I know of for now
---
It‚Äôs all subjective. There‚Äôs so many ‚Äúbis‚Äù variations.
---
If you are solo leveling and want a consistent kill speed, Rockbiter is the way to go all the way up to 60. That is of course also the most boring way and some people want excitement in their leveling grind.
---
Real talk tho, I chose frost cause I know its easy for leveling on PVP and good for raiding, especially when at least one mage takes Winter's Chill . Is there any benefit to being a fire mage this early on in the content? I've been to MC the last two weekends and it just doesn't seem like a good route right now
---
ClassicDB just uses old comments from thottbot/WoWhead. Their data is a mix of old and new. Before classic was announced the site was initially called VanillaDB and was the go to source for all things vanilla for pserver players.
---
It's just feels like I never see trolls, I'm so sorry if you were offended by my comment. They are sooo cute and bring diversity to the world. I glad that you are finding enjoyment in playing those happy little trolls!:)
---
I always thought the full name was "The Sunken Temple of Atal'Hakkar" and figured the in-game sources were like real people, shortening it because that's name would be a mouthful.
---
Watch some videos like punkrat and hakurai on YouTube, they have great info on warrior leveling. I did skinning and mining until 30. Vendoring the leather and sending bars to my alt for holding. Then dropped skinning at 30 for engineering. Min/maxed it with the banked materials until in could make iron grenades, which multiply when you craft them and vendor well. Bought my mount at 40 easily. At 60 now with right at 500g. Mostly from mining but if you're smart with what you grind on and how you spend your money you'll be ok.
---
Oh wow.  You make such a great point too about forums.  So many lost connections due to no battlenet RL friend list back then. So many guilds had their own websites that are now long defunct in lieu of guild discords nowadays.  And with forgotten guild names, and character names, etc, I wonder how many friends are playing together now in classic without even realizing they know each other from years earlier.
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, there‚Äôs tons of warriors. It‚Äôs just that most of them refuse to tank. I‚Äôm not sure if that was their initial plan when rolling warrior or if they just ended up hating tanking
---
Nobody needs to worry about anything if they encounter a single gray of the other faction. Server population doesn't matter for those situations.
---
Learning to use keybindings back in the day was a literal game changer
---
Thanks, from everyones comments i get the core of the spec and playstyle now, just need to mess around and see what I want to do with the utility points - I'll try serrated blades but not sure giving up improved sap and losing flexibility in 1v2's is worth it.
---
We took your boat and made you ride like a punk, hiding on the outside.  How much self-respect do you have?
---
I‚Äôve read that leveling warriors stack agility.
---
Similar story, asked a Hunter to back off on multishot by a few seconds until I had control of the pull. Hunter got huffy and argued that I need to be faster at controlling a pull. I shot back that 3-5 seconds is not a long time to need to have control of 3-5 mobs. Guy got even more pissy and stopped giving me any lead-in time whatsoever, and started complaining about me not being able to hold aggro. Every time he'd pull aggro, he'd run away from it, rather than feigning death or bringing it back to the tank.  
---
I really think the guy was trying to fuck me over just so he could make it look like the whole thing was my fault. Too bad four of us were in a guild, and we just replaced him with a guildie and everything ran smooth after that.  
---
I never understood the rationale of this kind of hunter. I blame retail for this mentality. It trained DPS out of paying attention to threat or target priority.
---
Probably going to get called an idiot here.
---
But enchanting. I basically get handed gold in Ironforge all day for doing nothing. Been making around 100-200g a day for the past week.
---
Classic isn't a billion dollar project. That's not how companies work lol. Classic is the lowest budget project they have had since the 90s.
---
The big difference is a lock has no downtime levelling

Why is everyone so hostile in this post??

I saw one over the weekend going for 800ish gold on my server.

Flamelash summons multiple Fireguard Destroyers in the hallway prior to the fight. But his aggro range isn't that big. I've been doing BRD a lot recently and we couldn't for the life of us figure out where those guys were coming from. After some deep diving I found out about the spawns, explaining it's their as a way to prevent ridiculous kiting strategies. Our shaman/lower level caster dps were pulling these mobs during the fight. 
---
The best way to handle the fight is to enter the room, and move to one of the corners. It still funnels his adds somewhat, and keeps you free from pulling the fireguards.
---
This right here.  It's a thankless job.  15 damn years and not ONE person has thanked me for tanking.  (Not fishing for thanks here.  Just thank the people that tank for you in-game.)
---
Just get healer gear and heal with shadow spec. Working perfectly fine for healing in MC. Some other people here said you can comfortably heal as shadow till Naxx without problems.
---
Literally all they had to do was host the lightbringer core and everyone would have been happy lol
---
That‚Äôs what the majority of people wanted I guess? It would have been much easier on their end to just make everything match the 1.12 copy the found rather than try to release things in phases.
---
The dungeon running success metric is maximum clearspeed without deaths. Too many misguided tanks and healers think an ideal group is a 2 hour run where the dps single targets 1 mob at a time and tank holds threat on everything while the healer never dips below 90% mana. That's just inefficiency and wasted resources. Your group should be pulling the greatest number of packs possible that everyone can survive.
---
Perfect healer play is finishing combat with 0 mana and everyone at full life so you can drink while the next pull starts. If that means dpsing because incoming damage is too low to exhaust all mana with heals only, do that too.
---
Even on DSL your latency shouldn't be that high.  I do tech support for another ISP that has a ton of rural DSL subscribers, and their latencies to Toronto are usually in the 20-30ms range.

If you get a chance, run a speed test on [speedtest.net](https://speedtest.net) to both the auto-detected server and to a server in Chicago, and let me know what the ping results are to both.

---
VC was also much more a real thing for Alliance than Horde. The Horde had to go out of their way to enter the dungeon and had no quests, meaning if a Horde was going there they knew it was called Deadmines.
---
VC also varied server to server and, to my knowledge, was way less prevalent on European servers due to Dire Maul being available at release and many EU players already having played on NA.

Competitive fights is literally why arena became a thing. Wpvp isnt about competitive fights its really the least balanced way to fight because you can call for backup, have npcs join in, and even the environment plays a huge role.  
---
Idk why anyone would think wpvp is fair or competitive. After having many fights its very very clear that its arguably the worst type of pvp there is because most people will only engage if its 2v1. When theyre alone, theyre cool, but soon as they have a friend is when suddenly they want to fight or you get picked on while trying to kill a mob.  
---
Now im not saying I love arenas as im way more of a bg man myself, but wpvp isnt balanced by any means and really just feels like is there to promote people being dicks.

LFM tank scholo...that is one of the saddest things to watch in the lfg channel since there is almost 0 useful loot for a tank in that dungeon. Groups are searching for hours sometimes.

Fortunately Ragnarok Online didn't really have punishments like this. There was an &gt;!extremely unpopular!&lt; PvP mode that coincidentally was called "Nightmare Mode" where you could actually drop items on death, but it was so unpopular that it eventually got disabled on the official servers.

If I fucking take time to /wave at you as we pass by each other and you can't even provide the same level of decency... die, scrub. It always does suck when I wave then they wave and bow.

32 druid on my first toon. Rolled a warlock last week, level 18 atm, on another server to play with a friend.
---
Really? Why have I not heard abt this b4?
---
There's something about rolling an Orc Enhancement Shaman too, I've had very few encounters on my almost 50/50 PvP server.  Honestly just stay away from the guy who (with good procs) can nearly 1 shot you.
---
You‚Äôre taking this way too seriously. Saying that sincerely.
---
&gt; There's no reason to not just run whatever spec you want, tbh. Classic balance is awful, so just lean into it and do what you think is fun.
---
There's a [discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/tZcjhsn) revolving entirely on the notion of going unconventional stuff and pushing it to its max potential. Worth a look imo.

You are wrong about all of those minus the first 2

Oh I thought it might‚Äôve been an add on or something. Still cool though
---
I do early on, but when you are fishing for your last few upgrades it is kind of a treat to be able to turn your brain off a bit. Gets tiring being the group lead/therapist every run once you are 30-40 runs deep.

It's because your name is silent

Yeah:) is he a full time Kitty or does he bear as well? :)
---
I take it this doesnt apply to wands then? Since my spells are independent of the attack
---
Nah with a Warlock you guys should be good to go.  Warlock will essentially have unlimited mana.. just make sure to manage your own well enough so you aren't OOM when you guys need those emergency heals (but also you have health potions + healthstones).
---
Should be a fun time IMO.

It's short for "mobile object".

FoF begun as a group of close friends with experience across multiple expansions. We have grown into a tight-knit group currently around 30 members, about half of which have begun to enter endgame dungeons to farm pre-bis.

We are looking for more players in the level 35+ range to join our main group as they finish up leveling and start to farm end-game dungeons and move into raiding. Both core-raider and officer positions are still open as we look to solidify our main group and supplement our leadership.

Am I right in thinking this could be great at pulling entire dungeons? I'm considering this for the use of leveling up low level friends.
---
We have so many healers in my guild that I ended up having to spec shadow because we have too many healers.
---
It's not just the cost of the ammo, it's the fact that you really need to keep track and be prepared before runs. This isn't retail where you can always just hearth out, do whatever you need to do, and then phase back in. If you get half way through a dungeon and suddenly realize you have no ammo left (which can absolutely happen with super-fast ranged weapons in a long 5-man where the group puts out less-than-optimal dps), you have no choice but to become a melee hunter, which is basically a squishy, light-hitting warrior that misses alot.

I thought it was with a sko sound also.
---
Mages as well, why can‚Äôt I ride sheeps?
---
finally hit lvl 45 huh? That was when I finished my last quest in STV
---
Yeah, the better way to do it is to get ganked, get on your Horde character, hunt the other player down, and mercilessly spawn camp them for as long as it took you to get there.
---
That's what I wanted to try but no luck in having it drop yet.
---
The red fog was so thick I thought my client was bugged when I went up there.
---
The reasonable thing to do is do a lower BRD run (Prison, Houndmaster, Arena, key quest, Dark Coffer, Darkvine, Incendus) and you can tank that at 54-55.
---
Then an Upperd BRD run (Bael'gar, Angerforge, Golem, Tavern, Attunment, Emperor) and you can tank that at 57-58.
---
Right you are, thanks for the correction. So this is post-buff perception, eh? Woof.
---
We have 2 shadow priests in our raid. Works well enough but its rough with all the consumes.
---
I dont remember it being as rampant. Tbh
---
Feels like every negative interaction ends with someone saying it
---
Sure, I've had bad DPS pulling extras or needing items they don't need, but I have never had a DPS complain about my tanking. I've had them ask for bigger pulls sometimes but that's the farthest it's ever gone.
---
I agree.  Only tanked 5 man's so far up to Mara and haven't had any issues.
---
Wiped 4x now trying to solo this quest. Officially giving up on that BiS Necklace
---
It should say when bend the knee to China and the reward for your loyalty

Okay, that's nice man!

This is mainly just towards people's play-style and playing how they want to.

IIRC it is an actual subject of matter.
---
You are totally entitled to think how you want man!
---
Hope you have a good day.
---
Have you considered if you‚Äôre getting that much scrutiny perhaps you‚Äôre in part to blame? 
---
Maybe your rotation can be better, or perhaps a little kiting here and there. Maybe you just need to communicate with the group. 
---
While tanking can be thankless and arduous your summarizations have not been my experience in my numerous hours played tanking.
---
I've been seeing a lot of this "just solo it" in LFG channel. Retail mentality spilling over.
---
Aggro

The alliance loves the D
---
&gt; There are no talent tree in retail
---
... but there are talent trees in retail. The visuals and the data changed, sure, but the feature remains (only important part).  
---
It's obvious that they tested talent trees, otherwise we would have seen way more bugs. Can't test everything though, so obscure stuff like this makes it to production ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
If you enjoy lock, play it. It's not too common at top levels and it's a pvp beast.
---
The reason it's not usually played is people don't enjoy how its abilities work.
---
Even then there are better weapons for him to have that he could get before these.
---
Our main tank went awol. Been tanking everything as bear for two weeks now.
---
I feel like this is ignoring that the extra attack also has attack power added, so you're not getting an extra attack at just base weapon damage, but a full extra attack. While leveling my fury warrior I would see Thrash proc crits for &gt;400 damage. Basically take the complete DPS of your main hand (weapon DPS plus AP/14, I think) and increase that by 4% minimum - probably a bit more, since unless I'm wrong it also procs off yellow attacks.
---
Just like HoJ, its damage increase will scale as you get better gear. It does get obviously brute-force outperformed by Onyxia weapons and probably MC gear as well, especially as it has no secondary stats, but the weapon is definitely worth more than an additional 1.4 DPS as you say. It's super strong for fury warriors since (again AFAIK) the extra attack gives you additional Rage, even when proccing off a yellow hit.
---
The power of ganking in BRM while yelling ‚ÄúARCANITE REAPER HOOOOO‚Äù cannot be under valued.
---
I see everyone with them and I still have not seen a single sword drop in UBRS.
---
Last time around (15 years ago) a rogue was my main.  Pretty easy to level, and avoid ganking.  This time around, I'm having more fun on my priest than the mage, which is surprising.
---
VC you retail baby.
---
Is DM coming out at midnight?
---
Oh okay gotcha. Well I love tanking so far, but I can relate to it being tedious when the group doesn‚Äôt understand aggro.
---
650-750g on my server - Kurinnaxx Horde
---
I was watching DM:T speed run vids last night. I assume the priest was on a private server because of how recent it was. Essentially, they MC an ogre, and just get it to die agroing the other ogres until the way is cleared. I've just heard MC doesnt work this way in classic
---
Then why'd it change in TBC? I started early TBC and it was DM... Guess because people stopped running Dire Maul?
---
Just "accidently" pull threat off him on every boss.
---
It‚Äôll be out after server maintenance tomorrow, same as every other patch moving forward.
---
Turtle scale gloves? I had the same problem. I go my two pairs from just trying the trade channel and shouting for LW's
---
Funny thing is since i completed the quest i think i have bought like 5 of the patterns from the vendor as he seems to have it every time i was passing
---
I think the shortage of tanks comes from the severe root issue that they need to make up 20% of players for dungeon content but only 5-8% for raid content.  Thus, there‚Äôs little incentive to play as a tank if you want to raid. Couple that with how hard and punishing the role is in all the other ways and you get the shortage.
---
The fact that they were even able to get others to join reserved runs and get their loot first points to this shortage.
---
Nightfall training wheels. Keep up the melee practice.
---
It‚Äôs the same on Alliance side on Westfall.  Thick and rugged sell a bit, but anything below is vendor trash.
---
Was he a druid by chance? ALL roles.....
---
Once you've done a few runs with the same group you don't have to mark mobs any more...but you're still basically the only one that is having to properly concentrate...
---
Bingo.
---
And since I'm a cheapskate, I won't respec out of the wand dmg to get shadowform at 40. I'll just get it at 45
---
So here's the thing - some PVP is "consensual" in that people are all looking to PVP against one another, to raid cities, etc. And that's all cool. 
---
And then there's the people who make it their mission to attack people who are questing and minding their own business, to spawn camp them, to harass them. 
---
And while it's a minor convenience, it's still deliberately spending your time to make someone else have a worse day. And the people who do that are trash. 
---
You can excuse it all you want, about how it's a PVP server and people opted in - but in the end, you're actually spending your time to make someone else miserable and deriving joy from that. 
---
It's low stakes, it's easy to excuse to yourself, but it's a fundamentally sociopathic mindset - driving pleasure from causing displeasure.
---
I have no clue, but to me the scene seems like a writing prompt where QT simply had to give Butch (Bruce Willis) a strong enough reason to risk his life going back, and just decided to go completely over the top. Like, let‚Äôs have Christopher Walken go over his whole family history condensed into five minutes and symbolised by an ass-watch
---
It should affect combat ratings.
---
I'm not sure if I get what you mean but I use bartender and you can even move the artbar. The only thing that I don't like is you can't switch between the two mainbars
---
If going Feral, you can't use eng items while in form.
---
Or just do a few more quests and out-level the dungeon.
---
Fear, wait for wotf, deathcoil, run away and dot  while theyre coiled, wait 2 seconds after coil, cast fear, win. There i just taught you how to beat wotf. Its not that op.
---
levelling efficiency isn't about how quickly you can kill things, its about how much you can kill without having to stop and eat/drink.
---
Also taking 2 days to 20.. that means 1-10 took you around 10 hours and the barrens took you 30+ hours /played I'm not sure how that's even possible

&gt; We did 3 shaman, 1 hunter, 1 mage Cath and it went super smooth.
---
&gt; Have to actually be an OK player though... Which I guess feeds back into the issue.
---
Shamans are surprisingly good tanks, there's a few guides about it on wow head pretty cool stuff.
---
Well then I could kill him just by my self
---
That is actually unfortunate to hear, especially since not everything is soloable. Until you can eventually level over it anway.

Hello also fellow bigglesworth!

are the warriors going into MC actually fighting over 2hers?

I'd think reapers haven't been too common because they are expensive in mats and Arms isn't great for pve.  With PvP not really prominent yet, I'd assume there is less of a push for arms warriors to get such an item.
---
My understanding is that LFG addons are just chat parsers.
---
Protadin!
---
I tanked it at 56 without issues. with a 55 healer. I wouldn't have gone much lower though. Maybe with a higher healer you could drop lower.
---
Most don't run off aggro'ing
---
Whatever side gets them the most money.
---
Yeah, at least with feral, you can tank or dps, so it opens up a lot of raids.  Also, just got leader of the pack talent, which people LOVE to have in the group.  It does seem like the druid is the jack of all trades master of none though.  It's nice being able to go kitty, kill a bunch of mobs, hop out, heal, go back to killing quickly though.
---
I play a druid and have engineering/alchemy. I wouldn't trade engineering for anything, it's amazing. You will make less money without herb but it will probably be more effective moneymaking. Picking flowers isn't very effective compared to buying all herbs on AH to make pots, and aoe farm water elementals, or whatever, when you are done.
---
&gt; Except it's entirely different for someone to be a decent person in real life than it is in a video game where you and the people you're around all created characters bound to the idea that anyone can kill anyone anywhere without consequences - it's part of the game.
---
It's not entirely different. The stakes are very low, but if someone derives pleasure from making someone else have a worse day - someone else who is not trying to participate in world PVP and just going about their day questing - that's not decent behavior. 
---
Decent people PVP against people who want to PVP, and leave people alone who want to be left alone.
---
I agree with all of these meanings, and would like to add one thing.  Claiming that you got ganked carries connotations that the deck was stacked against the player who died.  However, sometimes it can just mean that you were killed during a PvP encounter.
---
Supply and demand my friend. You can‚Äôt ignore it out of existence.
---
Maintenance is Tuesday morning every week, the login message shows up Monday morning typically.
---
I do the exact same thing in vanilla right now.
---
Jesus. An arcanite bar is only 39g on my server
---
**&lt;Thigh Inquisitor&gt;  NA // PVP // ALIANCE // Casual Raiding** 
---
Raid times:  **Alternating Tuesday and Monday nights @ 7:00pm Server. Done before 11:00.** (To be clear ‚Äì this means **ONE** night per week) 
---
Loot system: **DKP**  (to be implemented once our raids are majority guild members) 
---
The main thing to note about &lt;Thigh Inquisitor&gt; is the raid schedule.  There are many reasons to raid only once per week. Some of us do it to keep our wives happy, some of us do it to focus on PvP, or on alts, others simply don't have the time they once did to commit to this glorious game. Whatever your reason, if a once / week raid guild sounds appealing to you, this is your home.   
---
Our leadership is filled with people who did all this content 15 years ago. People who know these instances like the back of their hand - like an old, abusive friend.   
---
In order to keep progression moving forward we will sometimes alternate raid nights ‚Äì Tuesday / Monday ‚Äì so that we can do two runs in a single lockout. This will not always be the case, Molten Core for example will become fairly easy to clear in a single night before too long.   
---
On the casual nature of this guild: our schedule doesn't mean we're looking for lazy raiders.  We are casual due to frequency, that doesn't mean you don't have to know your class, know the raids, and make an effort on consumables.  Molten Core is not particularly difficult, but we would like to get to Ragnaros as quickly as possible.  In order to do this we need focused raiders who are interested in progressing and seeing the content, and who are willing to put in the necessary leg work.  That said, it's a pretty easy going group of people. 
---
PM me if you're interested.    We are in Discord every night, I'll send you an invite when you contact me. 
---
We are recruiting all classes. We prefer that you be level 50+, but are happy to invite people who are on a slower track. 
---
Thanks for reading!  See you in Azeroth.
---
His point is that it gets out of control. Imagine being a fresh 60. You just bought your Arcanite Reaper and you're ready to melt faces. You're looking at 53dps, plus whatever your greens and blues add to the equation. So you hit up WSG and immediately get one shot by the warrior with Might of Menethil. You go to Wowhead and look it up and realize this dude was rocking a 95dps mace and full Naxx gear. The top end damage of his weapon alone is 435 to your "sick" Reaper's 256. He does almost twice as much damage as you, with more crit, more AP, more Dodge, more HP. Then you notice that his rogue buddy's [1h sword](https://classicdb.ch/?item=23054) not only has a higher top end than your super cool, super expensive Reaper, it's got a 2.7 speed so its dps as a 1h weapon is 20 points higher than yours. Him and 2 of his buddies could do Onyxia, but it takes your guild 40. Their tank has so much dodge, block, and parry that raid encounters can't even be balanced around how much damage he takes, because it's so spiky.
---
Im confused and this sounds like crazy talk!!!!!!!
---
it's fun to have the big buffs and compete for top logs and such. it's not about need, but about fun.
---
you *can* do that, but you shouldnt *need to*
---
If your guild ends up that way it'll be your big chance to say "We're in the Endgame now"
---
One thing I enjoy is having enchanting and tailoring on my mage bc I personally think that the right professions massively helps a class
---
*says the guy who levelled blacksmithing and mining on his mage and then had to go back and get tailoring n enchanting*
---
RIP
---
I liked them because i enjoyed most of those dungeons. Just like i really SM dungeons and DM etc and i only get to them early and then never really come back. But thats fair enough and i can definitely see where you are coming from.
---
I'm sorry. But the lack of key ring is fucking absurd. "Oh, you guys wanted vanilla! HERE IT IS"
---
This was something implemented later in the Vanilla experience. Yes. But that was for no other reason than no one thought about it until the game was in full swing.
---
They are being VERY picky and choosy on what they are keeping from the classic experience. Last time I checked, raid markers were added in the same patch as the key ring. Guess what we have had since launch? Raid icons.
---
yeah it would take awhile for them to find out about it, and like you said it would take people reporting them for it. If there was nobody reporting it then chances are they have no idea the names of the people doing it.
---
idk... a piece of shit the size of a gnome... I would call that huge.
---
I've yet to actually meet one.  Pretty they are much more of a PvP spec though.  
---
In any case believing yourself better or more deserving of rewards because you chose the "correct" class is toxic and kind of ruining the classic wow community.
---
Why would salute the enemy, especially on an RP server?
---
Yup yup!  I understand this; good news is I shift a lot in PvP to keep the upper hand/heal so I can use that time back in regular form to pop off any eng items.
---
That's an either or statement
---
I would never use the mats to make reaper, just stating how frustration might push someone. As a dw fury warrior on a pvp server, it sucks basically being fodder in most situations. If I had a good 2h I would be arms the rest of the week. 
---
So yeah, there is a "fight" for raid 2hs
---
I mean anyone can get carried if there a few levels below witch usually ends up happening... so ima day 60... just get those extra two levels so it turns into a smooth run.
---
Some friends of mine cooked up a scheme to sell reapers but I think me and another fella talked them out of it when we pointed out that Obsidian Edged Blade drops from four bosses in MC.
---
It‚Äôs worth it once you get mount. You farm faster and 1g is like 10 mobs in late 40s.
---
Up until maybe a week ago, I could make a bit on those two as well, but now it's barely over vendor too. It makes sense though, I was a bit ahead of the leveling curve, and now that everyone has caught up, the market is flooded with those two as well. I'm hoarding it with the assumption that prices will climb once people hit 60 and drop skinning for other professions.
---
Did you watch the clip? Someone helped the hunter in the video, so the fact that it‚Äôs a PVE realm doesn‚Äôt matter. I was replying to someone‚Äôs comment who was trying to justify being a dick as somehow being the messenger for higher meaning.
---
&gt; If you seriously dont think someone killing someone on a pvp realm is okay for whatever reason youre wrong.
---
Sure, you can go kill any of the opposite faction in contested territory since it‚Äôs a PVP server. Killing someone while they‚Äôre soloing elites, which is no easy task, doesn‚Äôt make you any less of a dick though. The ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay because I can‚Äù argument is short-sighted because the player is clearly handicapped when they‚Äôre killing this tough, elite mob. As a matter of fact, if you‚Äôre someone that‚Äôs killing other players in this situation, that‚Äôs exactly what PVP is not. PVP = player vs player, not player vs player vs environment. 
---
There‚Äôs no honor is what the other commenter and you are suggesting, so yes, a dick.
---
You can go to unfinished ZG too , the middle temple is  different and there are other changes
---
Bit of one and the other :)
---
Was just wondering if anyone got it to work maybe with a 1h and shield? I've yet to try it yet do was just wondering if others have tried. Thanks for the replies!
---
I've never played WoW before but I remember watching the South Park episode they made about WoW and the nerd guy going full murderhobo and killing all the players. I thought it was a pretty funny joke and an exaggeration but after seeing some of the memes and reading some of these comments, it sounds like it wasn't that far off. Do high level players really go around trolling and murdering low level players?
---
Thais id worse than dying and waiting for the countdown.
---
no pet is tanky enough to withstand the aoe in mc tbh, you'll have to spend a lot of time micro-managing it and it's just not worth it.
---
Unless healers are actively healing it (which they wont be) best not to be BM in raids
---
Consider this with oversaturation. Mages are stacked in raids. half my raid is mages. Warlocks we usually have 4 and max 5. Oh and warlocks are still competing with mages for non tier gear.
---
I'll just leave this [here](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info4459-Bagnon.html)
---
You're a beauty.  Thanks for the insight!
---
As a mage, the only time I target what the tank isn't, is when the tank isn't focusing the highest threatening enemy. Or when initial target is about dead and I switch because it would die before my cast time goes off anyways. Warlocks can probably get away with multi DoTing each enemy. If a tank doesnt LoS, will sheep and or counter spell - that pulls aggro. I also feel it's my job with CC to help the tank get mobs into position, including casters - since its rudimentary for a mage to do so. I'm just saying some tanks run in and just stand there and wait for the group to pick up every thing else (without marking) and get upset when they die or you pull aggro. Just like good healers and dps are hard to find, so are tanks.
---
I mean they prob knew it was giving more than it was meant to give with their experience from years on p-server? Was it an exploit to do it before it was fixed? Not in my eyes, but they likely knew they were taking advantage of it while doing it.
---
I got ganked for /waving.  Was on a boat, the Alliance ignored me for 90% of the trip. It wasn't until I waved at them that they turned around and attacking me!
---
Isn‚Äôt 1.12 after 1.10?
---
Farm some water elementals that drop ....water to drink. I spent 10 mins last night getting 30 which will do me plenty of time.
---
Wrong
---
I used to flame people who tried poaching.
---
There's enough to go around for everyone. If the satyrs are overfarmed you can also farm the mountain giants, they drop like 10-20 silver each mob.
---
is that the 2h with '3 charges' ?
---
Dude that is one of the best games I have ever played.
---
"Back to the pit!!!"
---
"How quickly the tide turns!!"
---
I honestly expected someone to one word reply with "Threat" in this thread.
---
Dextren Ward does not aggro the other mobs. However, his Fear is AoE and he uses it liberally.
---
Alchemy doesn't really need herbalism, imo. The money you can make off of transmutes/high end recipes can sustain itself. Probably not enough to sustain engineering as well, but it should be manageable. Putting alchemy on your alt also sounds fine, probably more optimal, but not that big of a deal.
---
I want Sally Whitemane more than anything I've ever wanted in my entire life. Imagine your childhood desire to receive a coveted toy, or your urge to eat your favorite meal after a long day. Now imagine this urge tenfold. Nay, hundredfold. I imagine us basking in each other's glow while we sit in front of the fireplace. The Shawshank Redemption is on, but we're not really paying attention, because we can't stop thinking about pressing our bodies together and creating the beautiful musical melody of love and passion. I enter her as we become one singular being, a being of lust and yet, simultaneously, of tenderness. These thoughts have consumed my life. It started out small: I would think of plunging my chivalrous shaft into her luscious pink body during lunchtime or a spare moment. But this built and built until all I can think of, during all hours of the day, is serenading Sally Whitemane  with my harmonious love songs that I wrote just for her while I caress her pink body, the encapsulation of sensuality, and engulf myself within her pink radiance. I imagine her hat closing us off from the rest of the humanity as we engage in unspeakable escapades within our own private little world. That's what I want. That's what I need.
---
No data on the AC of the mob that he pulled this data from. If we assume that all AC is 0 then yes RB will always be better DPS.
---
Yes.  I‚Äôm trying to navigate this awkward space at the moment.  Druids have this awkward transition where they aren‚Äôt really wanted as a healer to use for dungeons (given their only 30m battle Rez understandable) but they aren‚Äôt really wanted to tank in raids.  So what‚Äôs a Druid to do?  They‚Äôve got to farm gear for healing while they tank in feral.
---
No reason to get it, too expensive for its worth in classic.
---
OP is presenting the perspective that it does and backing that up with his experience. It sounds fairly reasonable, and others in the thread agree.
---
I mean if you have any reason or evidence to suggest he's wrong, I'm all ears, but until then it's a bit of a toss up and I'm tending towards his understanding.
---
&gt; the "higher morality" douchebags who think ganking is a morality issue. 
---
There is morality to it, because even though the harm of taking away someone's time that they're trying to devote to questing is a minor harm, it's still a harm - and in PVPing against those people, you're deriving pleasure from denying them enjoyment. 
---
You can abstract that all you want, say "it's just a game," or call me a "higher morality douchebag," but the fact is that we should hold people in contempt who derive pleasure from causing others pain or in denying them enjoyment. It's an insight into the fundamental aspects of personality that make them tick. 
---
You're not a sociopath if you want to world PVP. But you have some sociopathic tendencies if you see seek out someone who can't fight back and make them miserable because you find that enjoyable.
---
FYI, I've had warlocks who litearlly sahdowbolt enemies while I'm LoS pulling and going 'My friend just spams battleshout and holds aggro over all aoe and everything'. My response was 'Ok, go get him to tank then, he can just automate it to hit battleshout every second and afk right?'
---
This was actually happening last night. Wasnt using MCP or particularly trying to pull aggro and had to literally stop pressing buttons to not blow them away on threat.
---
You bastard. I‚Äôm totally doing this.
---
And that is pretty much what I enjoy. I‚Äôd rather sit back and dps the entire time, and occasionally heal as needed. 
---
It‚Äôs just that most feral Druid‚Äôs are expected to tank. It‚Äôs why I am considering just maining a rogue at this point.
---
Yep.
---
I know as soon as I have the gloves I will see the pattern on the vendor/AH. I am gonna try spamming LW in Storwind/Trade channel. 
---
What is a good amount to tip for making the gloves? I am providing all mats, just need there 'skill'.
---
&gt; But I think a sizeable amount of it is people who enjoy wasting other players time and upsetting them
---
Nailed it, and those people are trash.
---
Everyone abbreviated my first characters name to "DM" when the game came out. Then Dire Maul came out and terk mer name!
---
As a Warlock, we love our Druid brothers and sisters. Great tanks, DPS, and healers, and the occasional HoT to counteract our Life Tap is such a nice boost for our DPS. Especially as you mention, healing is gives you more threat. So we can then continue to go big DoT DPS!
---
And I haven‚Äôt forgotten you too, Priests! Lovin‚Äô that Renew cast!
---
wowhead.com will tell you where the most of any node is.
---
I'd just like to say, for dungeons bosses are usually (not always) the easy part, and definitely the smallest part. Being able to clear a dungeon quick is a desired part of grouping. 
---
I don't really care too much who I invite as long as the dungeon is possible in a reasonable amount of time, but there are real tangible disadvantages to bringing dot classes to 5 man's.
---
I think if they are being persistent then they should be flamed. Other than that, it‚Äôs just a question. No bribing or harassment is what makes it okay to me.
---
Back in the days my server named Deadmines dm (lower case) and Dire Mail DM (upper case).
---
TBH I always preferred naming it dm instead of VC
---
How crazy is the instance entrance going to be first day lmao I slightly enjoy the chaos that ensues when shit like this is released lol
---
Tank is really the hardest to carry though anything.  High damage taken low threat unless you manage to get hit rating
---
I agree that the extra dungeons you can run does keep things fresher. But at the cost of world building? The simple fact is that there's no one solution that will work for everyone.
---
I paid someone 25g to get the ring at level 45 and got the sword too. Pretty lucky. So I'm done with mara.
---
Yeah I always check to get all the quests before dungeon so that sounds like the next step is either Sunken Temple (not sure what level) or BRD around 52-53. Thanks for the heads up!
---
Trinkets and baubles... paid for in blood.
---
Lol that‚Äôs not altoholicism.
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
This is a non-issue. VC spam mostly happens in Westfall. DM spam will be trade chat. They are also two very different level ranges.
---
If you see a lvl 19 player LFG DM, you should be smart enough to know he *clearly* wants to do Dire Maul East.
---
Let this die.
---
I used to drop an infernal on that bridge and watch the chaos as every other lock did the same thing.
---
What type of gold farm, preferably NPC farming with no professions required, can I do at level 50 with a pocket healer that will provide both good exp and money?
---
Anyone with vuhdo have issues with the smartcast rez function? Was playing with unrelated settings and now its not working and cant get it back. Any idea what would effect it?
---
For Lyceum you really really want a mage. Doing great aoe damage without having to stop is irreplaceable there. Warlock is an option but not nearly as good. Also make sure you line of sight the mobs so you don't end up with 50 riflemen shooting you from all directions. If you're still having trouble, standing on the bump that lines the outer edge of the room makes melee mobs unable to hit you so you only take damage from the gunners, and can run around to the back side of the room with ease. Just hope the torch men don't spawn in the middle.
---
Yeah if your character can't fit on that nook you will have to stand on the island with fire elementals instead. If you're 60 you can do so without pulling aggro. Noggenfoggers might also help?
---
If you have an addon that shows mp5/energy ticks, you can use that to time your jumps and avoid lava damage completely and impress the party with your skill as you zoom past the plebs healing up on that ledge.
---
Yeah no reason to wait for the horse really. Looks terrible if youre an orc lock.
---
Oh fuck yeah dude!
---
We have a bear and a prot warrior who rotate MT based on which class has the better kit for that fight.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say that. The biggest hurdle ATM is the runed arcanite rod which on my server is valued at around 230g ATM. Then hunting down all the patterns that people want.
---
&gt; We must hide in the shadows
---
Nah, we just quest in Hillsbrad, Alterac Mountains, Duskwallow Swamp, Swamp of Sorrows, Badlands, Arathi Highlands, and Desolace and ignore stupid STV.
---
That is why they're is that damn trinket that makes you dance!! Holy shit mind blown...
---
Get an owl with screech, a bit better than the apes.
---
Because it‚Äôs a little expensive to start. Lol
---
Yep someone did a video of that a week back or so.
---
it was good pre weapon speed change. now its just meh. get dreadforge retaliator.
---
Now we know you're just trolling.
---
Bears have a taunt too, and pallies have Blessing of protection, 5min CD(3 if talented), but hey if one needs to taunt off the healer that often, there are probably bigger issues:)
---
It was.
---
It mostly failed outside of Asia where I've heard it's still going fairly strong.
---
&gt; Only thing ya learn in STV is how to disengage from multiple targets and survive.
---
\**laughs in Holy Paladin*\*
---
So that would also affect any powershifting Ferals as well.
---
Patch 1.10 didn't change these four bosses. They only became regular elites in WotLK and Cataclysm.
---
Elusive...evasive...persistent!
---
SavedInstances does this on retail, but I'm not sure if there's a fork for Classic.
---
sorry i did not mean to say that it was impossible for me to defend or react.  More accurately i died before i could react because i do not know the proper response to a rogue opening.
---
I...I want a mount now that is just a night elf pulling me around in a rickshaw holy fuck I want this so bad I would never use another mount again. The epic version should just give me a whip and an animation of me furiously whipping them as they run.
---
[Wiktionary credits the earliest modern usage of the word to The Simpsons in 1993,](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Citations:yoink#English) so maybe that was the start of it?
---
Yeah I did 57 to 60 in 2 days, 8 hrs a level. Would be even faster if I could actually get in dungeon groups.
---
If you're in cat form no since you have energy
---
It has had some bug or another.  But the state it's in right now is fucking terrible.
---
Those twats are the worst. Auto invite anyone near the same unique quest mob or go back to retail.
---
It was DM because dire mail didn‚Äôt exist when I was running deadmines.
---
blacklisted for farming!
---
Did it easily with 65 priest, and 70 hunter. Not sure why we bothered, since there are better drops in every instance.
---
Cant you get it as low at 31? Assumimg you put all points into shadow and it requires 30 shadow points
---
#  [A] &lt;Old Gods&gt; - NA-Kirtonos PvP | Mon / Weds 8-11pm EST | Casual 
---
Prepare for C‚ÄôThun‚Äôs arrival!
---
**This Week:** We will be hosting a Molten Core PUG tonight @ 8PM Est. We still have a few slots left and would love to have any attuned level 60s, regardless of prior experience with MC. We will use a Round Robin+Wishlist system, which is described on the sign-up page. Sign Up at: [https://www.oldgodsguild.com/oct-14-molten-core-pug](https://www.oldgodsguild.com/oct-14-molten-core-pug) 
---
**About us:** &lt;Old Gods&gt; is an Alliance raid guild led by Vanilla-era players on the Kirtonos server. Our leadership includes former raid and guild leaders with intensive high-level raid experience throughout Vanilla, TBC, Wotlk, and Cataclysm. Although raid-focused, we will happily admit players of all levels to help include friends and family of our members into our ranks. Our members have specialized in all professions, ensuring convenient access to weapons, armor, enchantments, and other important craft goods. We strive to foster a collaborative, fun, active, and relaxed community so that we can all experience the endgame content we fell in love with fifteen years ago. 
---
**Raid Times:** Monday, 8:00pm - 11:00pm EST, Wednesday, 8:00pm - 11:00pm EST
---
**Loot Rules:** For Raids including PUGs, we use Round-Robin + Wishlist. For Guild-Only Runs, we will use a weighted-rolls with loot-council system.
---
**Expectations:** First and foremost, we expect our members to be respectful, reliable, and present. This means showing up to raids on time, with the necessary knowledge to succeed for the night. You are not expected to spend 10+ hours per week farming consumables outside of raid nights, we're older now and our real life responsibilities (jobs, families, etc.) take precedent. If you're ever struggling to understand boss or class mechanics please speak up, we're all here to help each other succeed!
---
**Contact/Apply:** If you are interested, please apply through our website: [https://www.oldgodsguild.com/membership](https://www.oldgodsguild.com/membership) or feel free to contact Greckel, Boogie or Sqweekie#11667 in game for more information!
---
Thank you for your time, I hope you enjoy all the adventures to come!
---
Trick question there are no dungeon mecanics in Classic.
---
55+ if you‚Äôre really unsure just bring a level 60 healer or make sure to have a class that can off heal just in case. Also bringing a mage for the torch room will make your life much easier.
---
That and the emperor himself are probably the hardest things in the run. Make sure to pop all cool downs when he‚Äôs going enrage.
---
Arathi highlands, badlands, hinterlands. Those were my best spots
---
I was so tilted lmao. I had to wait another 10-15 min for the respawn and of course, by that point, all of the adds I just finished clearing had respawned as well. Luckily a hunter came along during this time and grouped up with me so it wasn't so terrible, but if I had any horde connections I'd be paying a gold fee to have that mage ganked.
---
Why no Deadly poison? Not even for PvE?
---
It was a server specific thing. Shadow Council back in vanilla was definitely VC.
---
That all depends on what others are farming, and you can't control that.  In general, it's just about the type of npc you farm - humanoids have cloth, each type of beast drops specific grays that vendor for differing amounts (+ skinning if you have that, but assuming that's not an option), elementals drop elemental &lt;whatever&gt;, etc.  Ideally, though, you want an area that is not being farmed by someone(s) else and is not needed to complete quests.  Bonus if you're farming in an area that has chest spawns.  At level 50, you might want to consider farming undead in Azshara - there are a few chest spawns in the area that should help with the gold/hr, and Azshara is a largely ignored zone.
---
Yep mages are good for this as well.
---
I was there for the kill. Everyone is always willing to help with whatever you need. We're still looking for friendly people looking for a raiding guild to call home. Hit us up if you're interested!
---
He didn't say he was good at the game.
---
From behind.
---
Like I found flask of supreme power recipe, but its devalued on my server for some reason. I'm not selling that for under 250-300g. I'll let my alt use it first to be able to craft for myself and guildies.
---
I'm lvl 53 and still tanking all dungeons in full arms spec with a few points in Fury. I'm always top dps too.
---
I mean, that‚Äôs fine if it‚Äôs natural, but that‚Äôs not how it happened.
---
First of all, the enchanted water only restores 1344 mana. I have 5k mana, so that's not gonna do. Second of all, 30 water lasts me maybe 1 dungeon run depending on the dungeon. It's just not viable to farm water, you'd be better off farming gold and buying it instead. However, that still doesn't change the fact that it's expensive and not worth wasting. It's better to wait the 10 seconds for me to drink to guarantee the pull won't result in a wipe.
---
As a brand new wow player. I don‚Äôt understand the problems people have with pug groups. I‚Äôve put together 50+ SM Cath and ZF groups. I am also an AOE Mage. I‚Äôve never had a problem. Before every run, I clearly state please hold DPS until the first Cone of Cold/Nova. And if someone does something they shouldn‚Äôt be doing I whisper them and nicely correct them. If you‚Äôre having problems, you need to say something. Or else it won‚Äôt get fixed.
---
Under "community options" in the right margin you will see the option to add flair (if you're on the main r/classicwow page.  there you can select your flair.
---
As a responsible hunter who watches aggro and doesn't multishot until it's safe, nothing drives me crazier than another ranged player pulling the entire pack of mobs right at us and into my deadzone, so then I have to awkwardly reposition myself to even attack properly.
---
Is this the new thing? Calling everything negative "retail mentality"?
---
On retail people dont say "just solo it" they press a button to get instantly put in a group
---
That's why you use the same name as before!
---
&gt; And every horde capital has a backdoor to our leader. 
---
Honestly, who gives a shit? If your leader dies, it means *nothing*. 
---
They're secure and contain (including Orgrimmar) two of the best instances from level 13 to level 25. Alliance doesn't have an analogue to RFC and WC is every bit as good as Deadmines. Then you have RFK and RFD. At those levels, Alliance are basically... having to run to RFK or RFD or SM, which is past totally secure Horde territory and super high risk and time-intensive. 
---
Our compensation are Gnomeregan and Stockades, both of which are awful. 
---
Horde have advantage in STV and Badlands, both of which are superb leveling areas.
---
Its not about being being able to solo or not. If theres mobs you have to kill for quest and other people need, why not group up? So instead of helping someone, they make them waste time
---
It's world of WARcraft, not world of FAIR and HONORABLE duelscraft. It's not about me vs you, it's about crippling the alliance. The warrior monk strikes when his foe his weakest, not strongest.
---
Who cares about pre-raid bis when MC/Ony are both complete jokes? You can 5 man Onyxia if you want to. Everyone except the MT could be in full spirit greens, or only wearing two pieces of gear, lol.
---
Thanks for the reply, but I was trying to specifically ask about DM East farming
---
Isn't this pretty much common knowledge? And if you don't know it, its the first thing said before the encounter as its pretty much the only mechanic of the fight.
---
It‚Äôs famous from the Simpsons.  ‚ÄúYoink‚Äù was supposed to be onomatopoeic (i.e., actually sounds like the sound it‚Äôs describing, like ‚Äúmoo‚Äù or ‚Äúsplash‚Äù) for the sound of snatching something away.
---
Some Simpsons dude eventually came out and said it was actually borrowed from old Archie comics, which makes it pretty old.
---
Cool thanks!
---
Well, originally it was said to be in P3, but then again they released DM before P2 which was its original set release date, so who knows. My guess is that if the backlash of having to wait for BGs for several months and FP camping is high enough, then they might just release it before scheduled.
---
Are you an Orc? I'm so jealous. I'm an orc fury warrior and I'm just going to save all my DKP for a Deathbringer. That friggin 2.9 speed. Thing must slap so hard.
---
Tank, who plans on tanking and only tanking. Rolled need and won the cloak off Baron over me (Hunter) which is my BIS until the end of Classic WoW.
---
So we all have our little issues we're dealing with.
---
Looks perfect, thank you üòä

# [A] &lt;Old Gods&gt; - NA-Kirtonos PvP | Mon / Weds 8-11pm EST | Casual
---
**This Week:** We will be hosting a Molten Core PUG tonight @ 8PM Est. We still have a few slots left and would love to have any attuned level 60s, regardless of prior experience with MC. We will use a Round Robin+Wishlist system, which is described on the sign-up page. Sign Up at: [https://www.oldgodsguild.com/oct-14-molten-core-pug](https://www.oldgodsguild.com/oct-14-molten-core-pug)
---
**About us:** &lt;Old Gods&gt; is an Alliance raid guild led by Vanilla-era players on the Kirtonos server. Our leadership includes former raid and guild leaders with intensive high-level raid experience throughout Vanilla, TBC, Wotlk, and Cataclysm. Although raid-focused, we will happily admit players of all levels to help include friends and family of our members into our ranks. Our members have specialized in all professions, ensuring convenient access to weapons, armor, enchantments, and other important craft goods. We strive to foster a collaborative, fun, active, and relaxed community so that we can all experience the endgame content we fell in love with fifteen years ago.
---
As a warlock, I welcome any 1v1 from someone who is AT LEAST 5 levels HIGHER than me, or any 2v1 (or 3v1) of people similar level. Rogues and hunters should feel the same way, tbh.
---
Baffled? lol.
---
Your reading comprehensions skills are so bad my friend.
---
You hunting weaker people on purpose is bad. And you are lying to yourself, not to others. 
---
"Hypocrisy is the contrivance of a false appearance of virtue or goodness, while concealing real character or inclinations, especially with respect to religious and moral beliefs; hence, in a general sense, hypocrisy may involve dissimulation, pretense, or a sham. "
---
- false pretense  - you claiming that twinking is good pvp, because supposedly pvp'ing at lvl 60 is bad(what's your reasoning for not pvp'ing at 60 btw?) while in reality is 90% white geared noobs smashing.
---
- dissimulation - you know i am right and that percentage i mentioned is very close to reality, therefore your attitude is a sham, a public facade to make you not look like a total scrub who bullies weaker players on purpose.
---
We don't know that they didn't already plan to bring Dire Maul forward though.  Their ambiguous wording choice of the first "patch" suggests to me that they already had it in mind.  otherwise why not say phase 2? or the next Phase
---
Neither does priest. Frontline smh, wand to finish while spirit tap tops ur mana off.
---
Try levelling a warrior, then you'll understand.
---
You have a traitor in that crowd...find and eliminate them.
---
West Coast
---
you start spending talent points at lvl 10
---
ClassicThreatMeter is the only one that I've found that exists, but it works. I has the downside that it only shows party and raid members who have it installed, but that's probably due to API limitations in classic. Any tank worth their salt has it installed anyway.
---
If 1g for a few stones makes you don't wanna play a realm im not sure any realm would be the perfect fit
---
Will be*
---
I have skinning but no secondary, wish I picked up mining or herb but it was too late by the time I decided to. 
---
When you come across a good location, density and decent drops, stay for a while. 
---
If auction prices are close to vendor, don‚Äôt bother cause of fees and time. 
---
I think as you get higher, grinding is better cause of drops and less time wasted running around. Still do quests on the way but don‚Äôt be afraid to skip a particularly annoying one.
---
Edgy af title
---
It‚Äôs irrelevant for DME lasher farm. Packs are roughly 7-10 mobs of lashers that break your bubble super quick, and inner fire simply doesn‚Äôt last long due to the 20 charges.
---
Holy nova takes care of everything by itself due to doing damage and healing you.
---
How so? What would be the best way to do it?
---
For me yesterday, it was a pink haired gnome.  Killed me 4 times in a row.  I started just rezzing and sitting.  The idiot got bored eventually.
---
Momma bear‚Äôs class checks out
---
You know what I did my math wrong lol
---
do their doors reopen properly after he's defeated?
---
31/20/0
---
More to do, ZF, Maraudon, Sunken Temple, early BRD. All those should be run from 45-52ish. Once you get 50-51, you could really stay in WPL\EPL to 60. No need to run from STV to Hillsbrad, to Tanaris and back. Far less travel time which really speeds things up, too.
---
Over the past couple weeks, I've been having a recurring issue with my succubus.  I usually have her invis out of combat. \~20-25% of the time I send her to attack, sheruns up to the mob, hits it once, the mob evades, and she starts to run back to me and I have to send her in again.  This causes all sorts of issues from losing tags in heavily contested areas to getting threat if I've already applied a dot to just being plain annoying.  Has anyone else been experiencing this?   I don't want to submit a bug report if it isn't something others are seeing as well.
---
&gt; Yes, we do have the Keyring coming to WoW Classic. It won‚Äôt be available at launch, but it will be added in the first patch. 
---
read the post, it says in the first patch after launch, as stated this post was before they mentioned the DM early release, and as for "phases" they have always said they were going to release content in phases/patches people call them phases as it is based on the "Phases" that Vanilla patches were released, for example MC/Ony first then BWL/ZG and AQ20/40.
---
i'm not fully getting what point you are making, i just posted a link to a post that have a blue post in it and just said what it says in there.
---
Someone offers one for 3g yesterday lmao
---
as a leveling priest who is doing basically all dungeons : yes sir you are correct :-(
---
Ironfoe please :)
---
Ah right, also looking at your post and comment history is yikes. It all makes sense now.
---
Hell yeah life tap more... Im so bored sitting here with 95% mana
---
Ah, makes sense I'm like 297 :P
---
Sch is pronounced ‚Äúsh‚Äù on many words in the UK.  Schedule is shedule
---
ahh, i mainly use friends to reset but this'll work for when no friends are on, thanks mate.
---
Thank you! Nobody wants to quarter sip argent dawn water.
---
The problem is I have lorti UI (the one that darkens everything) and when I enable bartender it removes my lorti ui :(
---
Yup, rolled pve because I knew the idea of balanced pvp was a myth. It's almost always a massacre for one side, rarely an interesting engagement. Pvp is for battlegrounds.
---
I see. However, to put my opinions into perspective, my most favorite part of WoW was TBC, so we're gonna have different opinions obviously :)
---
There are two reasons I play Classic - I didn't really get to play it properly back than as I was little and kinda poor. It was only broken free servers for me during Vanilla.
---
And second, Classic is the closest thing to TBC which I did play and miss dearly to this day. 
---
Well... I played it somewhat at least. Raiding was difficult for me, but I did Kara, ZA and up to Vashj from the bigger raids. Would definitely love the option to play TBC again too and properly enjoy it this time.
---
Couldn't care less about some badges or whatnot. Nothing is without flaws, but to me TBC felt just right and it was WotLK that seemed like the start of WoW downfall to me.
---
Like, I found a staff thats +22 to all healing spells.. I was going to use it, but my current staff is like +4 int and +8 spirit... or maybe even more.. like +4 int and +11 spirit.. either way it would be a huge loss to both to just swap them out and I was unsure..
---
That‚Äôs going to be a real awkward family dinner after the first mageblade drops.
---
It bugs out when multiple people try to start th quest. Only 1 person should be dropping the quest item to begin the event, if more than one drops it, it bugs.
---
Thanks for the detailed reply man
---
Happy that it isn‚Äôt necessary
---
You da best
---
I answered as if you thought you we're actually providing an unknown thing, realize now that you're just probably joking :)
---
In my experience this is not an alliance specific problem. Getting camped while leveling by some no life with a tiny epeen happens no matter your faction. 
---
Just remember that getting upset or reacting is what they're after, and if you just ignore them or log for an hour and come back usually they'll have gotten bored or it's part their bedtime or w/e.
---
Nowhere in that blue post does it say "phase 2".
---
What if we sold that trinket not realizing it was bis....
---
That's for the night elf to courier gnomes across the landscape.
---
If tanks need gear from places other than DM they will still be running those.  If they already have that gear or know DM is coming out they already aren't running those instances.   The problem is that only a few dungeons have an incentive to run after you have the gear from them.  This was going to be the case regardless of DM.   Once DM has been out for a week or two and is no longer "new" content it will just be the normal amount of tank drought.
---
On the videos you‚Äôve seen (which are all private server), the coding of MC is such that any mob your MC aggros does not aggro onto you. On Classic, they do. So any strat that utilizes MC will not work.
---
However, aggro radii on Classic are smaller than private servers. So, this with Mind Soothe, we might be able to sneak past some of the packs that used MC. But we won‚Äôt know until DM releases as there‚Äôs no way to test it using Classic mechanics.
---
One thing is for sure, if this version we have now called "Classic" would be a pserver, it would get SOOOOO much flack for being "stock server" blablabla, cus there actually are SOOO many bugs that you have listed here, and many more.
---
&gt;1) LBRS: The pike event: Everyone told me "Its so hard, only 60's can do it". Noone seems to know you can just click the pike each 20-30 seconds to onehit a casterogre or deal 90% damage to a meele. Makes this event a breeze
---
Excuse me, what?
---
a patch is just a software version, it's 1.13 right now.
---
I plan on making a character like this at some point, basically the same rules as an ultimate Ironman from OSRS. I‚Äôve tried it on private servers and it‚Äôs immensely entertaining and changes your play style quite a bit! 
---
However, this was the major issue I was having. Whenever I tried questing solo I‚Äôd run into mobs with long respawn timers and would wait patiently until everyone in the area had completed it so I could try solo-ing. Usually some higher level would come by and help me kill it which would null the quest completion by my own set rules. Pretty frustrating, but I will try again in Classic!
---
You cant. You are not allowed to tame another broken tooth. You had your chance.
---
Not entirely true for this era. Bis lists were around by this time and dps warriors became a thing in BWL since that's the patch fury got buffed. Spellpower greens are still not close to BWL and beyond since you gain a bunch of hit and crit too. The point still stands that they have significantly better gear than we do now, the only crappy thing I see is that they have 2 2hand warriors as alliance and a ret. The rogues all seem to be combat daggers with very good gear.
---
People weren't as shit at understanding gear after MC as most people seem to assume, I know my guild wasn't clueless. I had a bis list in BWL that I followed and got a proper spec around that time too. The start of raiding vs later stages was very different because people learned the games mechanics and more proper itemized gear became available.
---
By cave you mean the tunnels connecting upper and lower floor? Or outside of the that whole final structure?
---
Gothik the Harvester
---
You do realize that most hardcore players are raiding a single hour per week right now?  We play hardcore because we specifically **want** to be outside and not dicking around in MC/Ony for 4+ hours.
---
I love how casuals criticize hardcore players, yet they spend an equal amount of time in-game, if not more, because of their inefficiencies.
---
Well ive never seen "solo it" thrown around so much when I played on private servers and I stopped playing retail during WoD and constantly saw that in chat so, yeah I'd say its a mentality from retail.
---
Diremaul was released about 4.5 months into Vanilla WoW.  
---
Even if what you are saying is accurate (i really don't know cause I started in 2005) then that means it was VC for approximately 2 years and was only called DM for about 4 months.
---
If it was VC for 2 years of classic and all of TBC until the creation of group finder in WoTLK of course people will remember VC.
---
Tbf, even if these few mobs were appropriately leveled, they‚Äôd be pushovers. They always were, we (the playerbase as a whole) were just really fucking bad back then. We have a lot more experience and info to play much better now.
---
Last night we killed the 4 elites and then the 4 healers, and just interrupt the heals. Plenty of ways to skin this cat.
---
And it lasts forever!
---
I think people are appreciating bears as the best 5 man tank. Still not widely accepted in raids yet imo
---
Proof that gnomes are the most annoying race.
---
Can confirm. My mother rolled a mage.
---
Nope! Retribution aura + consecration will hold aggro on all mobs for tanking.
---
Uh, no? 
---
Where the hell do you get I have an obligation to reduce my xp just so you don‚Äôt have to wait?
---
I think you are a thinking of a chariot.
---
Before the dungeon finder was a thing, I played on Dark Iron, Sargeras, Aggramar, and Coilfang all at varying times. Never once did I see people not use VC. 
---
In classic, I got so sick of the tug of war I just write the whole word out, because "I'm level 18 standing in fucking Moonbrook, you know very well what I meant." is more characters than "Deadmines".
---
Maybe respec the first few times you're raiding to a) demonstrate your ability and b) have more flexibility for the mistakes you'll make while you're still learning.
---
Later, you'll have some gear and practice and you won't need to respec.
---
So, if you don't want the silver dragons/gryphons whatever around the main action bar. I don't know what else from the default UI you are missing?  Dominos only replaces the action bars, menu bar, and bags. You can place the menu bar and bag bar in the same positions as with the default UI
---
Are you sure it's 3.79% and not, say, .85 ppm?
---
Added!
---
&gt; Berserker Rage
---
The warrior enters a berserker rage, becoming immune to Fear and **Incapacitate** effects and generating extra rage when taking damage. Lasts 10 sec.
---
Literally no tank I've ever played with realizes how useful that is in UBRS.
---
If my guild from vanilla hadn't rolled on a PVP server, I'd be PVE. On the bad days, I still consider doing a transfer to a PVE server.
---
I've had someone run past, aggro a mob, tap the mob with something like thorns, player continues running and the mobs reset. Then the mobs remain grey/tapped. Doesn't seem to be a ui bug, I've later pulled and killed them for zero xp/loot. That's not the intended behavior, right?
---
The joke is the human faces. Hahahahaha so funny I get it because in reality it would be honorless bastard horde, I get it!
---
You can bug Mograine to not drop loot. 
---
During the fight, when Whitemane gets low enough, she sleeps the whole party to battle rez Mograine. If she has enough DoTs on her at this time, it will kill her before she can rez Mograine. If this happens, Mograine's loot table doesn't generate.
---
Streamers were too focused on competing against each other and no-lifing content instead of actually beta testing.
---
Horde? Come to Ten Storms
---
China
---
But you also don't carry keys around.
---
I'd recommend healing aoe groups. As feral I was in a similar situation. I tanked or healed most dungeons. If you aren't big into grinding or questing AOE groups are the way to go. SM-&gt;ZF-&gt;BRD-&gt;60.
---
As long as you don't call it VC we are cool
---
...very rare. Very, very rare. Lucky.
---
in regions maybe? cause ive been saying skeejule all my life.
---
Played a hunter in vanilla... never raided with pet.
---
I get that this sub has a hate boner for streamers but the beta was only to level 40.
---
nah I wanna be chillin with a drink with a tiny umbrella just leaned back and whipping away like this is just what rich night elves do.
---
Just do you chief, there's no competition to be the most spec efficient for leveling.  Have fun, try out what you want.
---
Enter, Alt+up.
---
RPPvP servers are interesting in that the Alliance's RP bias and the Horde's PvP bias tend to balance each other out. Grob has great faction balance!
---
My screen is to small. Cant see what class it is.. thought druid first..?
---
It's quite a few (8) actually:
---
*  \[Workshop Key\] aka Gnomeregan key
---
*  \[The Scarlet Key\] aka Scarlet Monastery key (also usable in Stratholme to enter the Scarlet Bastion)
---
*  \[Prison Cell Key\] opens Blackrock Depths prison cells
---
*  \[Shadowforge Key\] aka Blackrock Depths key
---
*  \[Crescent Key\] aka Dire Maul key
---
*  \[Skeleton Key\] aka Scholomance key
---
*  \[Key to the City\] aka Stratholme key
---
*  \[Key to Searing Gorge\] Alliance side only, through a quest
---
Aside from the dungeon keys above it also holds temporary/quest keys.
---
Naming my son Doomhammer guarantees he will never be bullied.
---
Oh that‚Äôs sexy
---
I saw it frequently the first 2 weeks I played and was in Westfall often. Pretty sure DM won out for now but confident VC will be the primary designation after Dire Maul drops.
---
[https://youtu.be/6jHQQ5M8fgo?t=92](https://youtu.be/6jHQQ5M8fgo?t=92)  
---
I want that kind of UI that he has in the video. The dragons are gone to make it clean, but the rest of the UI is still there (the bags, help functions, etc etc) and he has moved both the right action bars freely to wherever he wants!  
---
I tried bartender, and bartender has the option to keep the blizzard UI but it somehow doesn't work with LORTI UI (the thing that darkens everything, he uses that also in the video), and when I use dominos I can't see any option to keep the blizzard UI.  
---
Does that explain it better perhaps how I want it? :P
---
havent you heard ?
---
retail bad classic good
---
Yes! :)  Our guild grew up on Stonemaul and reformed on Whitemain.
---
Check your servers auction house. I know they fetch good coin but it varies.
---
Sure.  But, what about people who take comments made in jest as actual opinions?
---
Enchanting is a money black hole, and I honestly feel like you don't get much benefit til a fair while into it. Like is 1 spirit on some gear you'll soon enough replace worth being slower to your 60% mount? By contrast stuff like blacksmithing, leatherworking, and engineering can all provide things you can even reasonably use at low levels. I'd say even alchemy has a couple of nice early benefits, like being able to make health potions on demand as you can't eat in combat. A warrior kited out with some emergency health potions feels great IMO, but really any class can benefit.
---
Thats a good one.
---
Best I can do is 2g
---
Same dude. People have been laughing that I‚Äôm not aoe spec even though I‚Äôm frost. But I do way more damage then some of the mages even Aoe‚Äôing
---
Well, as an MT I hate AoE Frost Mages so fucking much that enemy ones are KoS without question, and friendly ones are Grief-on-Sight.
---
Any and every single time I cross a friendly mage AoE grinding in WPL I will wait until he does his big fucking horse-pull-wrangle, novas, and then I'll drag the nearest elite or pack of mobs right through his blizzard.
---
Have you done it? I hadn‚Äôt until classic and it‚Äôs pretty fun. Prob gets old if that‚Äôs the only way you level 1-60
---
I already whooshed myself in my next reply. Proudly leaving my original comment.
---
When you get to the end of the world, you do a 360 and go the other way.
---
Why would tanks run DM for quel serrar? All you need is the book, which you're far better off buying than trying to actually farm yourself.
---
Besides, most tanks are actually DPS warriors and want DPS gear.
---
I main a tank and this is really the most important thing missed by a lot of DPS. DPS meters are fun and all, but they are only a small part of the equation. if everyone is working together as a unit dungeons become a breeze and a lot more fun.
---
It's a macro for something, presumably. Isn't that one of the available icons for macros?
---
I saw that a couple of times a month ago, but not for a while
---
I heard it was confirm they are skipping the TBC and making a TBC/WOTLK hybrid servers with 8 phases of release. ??
---
I always wished you could explore more of Ironforge. Further back into the more, more underground, those windows that are peaking, etc. We all know about Old Ironforge but I always wanted to be able to go inside the buildings and down the hallways that we can't see.
---
&gt; Most blues are better than gear from MC/Ony (with few notable exceptions). 
---
That's not even remotely true.  There are a handful of blues that are better than MC/Ony loot, and several that are better than T1.  But any BIS list including T1 will be primarily MC/Ony loot.
---
I play Alliance on Benediction and have never had a queue. I've liked it here a lot so far.
---
&gt; Right now in classic I have to sit inside SM to form groups and cat form sprint into different ones to not instantly die there.
---
Sit in instance until invited. Chill in instance until full. When it's time to change instances, run out, bubble, and hope that nobody fears me before I can get Arm/Cath unlocked.
---
ROFL that is amazing
---
In Thousand Needles, just before you get to salt flats. The graveyard is literally right there on the edge of the flats, but somehow, it only counts if you die *in* the salt flats.
---
So if you‚Äôre running for your life, don‚Äôt run out of the shimmering flats. If you just die, it‚Äôs like 10 seconds of running, but if you take a few steps to the west, it‚Äôs a 5-10 minute runback.
---
It's actually 11-17, but trends towards the 15-17 min mark in my experience.  Roughly that equates to 20 spawns per hour.  Even if they are all up when you get there, thats a max of 25 per hour if you kill every single one, so 30p/hour is bullshit.  ON top of that, its impossible to spawn camp all 5 due to the time to kill and travel time between spawns. Even keeping track of and spawn camping the nothern 3 spawns is hit and miss, as the spawn windows will inevitibly overlap.  On top of that, on most servers, and certainly on mine, the spawns are camped 24/7.  3-4 weeks ago I was able to farm ~12/hr on average at off-peak times as people hadnt worked out spawns or timings yet.  But now I am lucky to find, tag and skin 4-5/hr without lsoing the tag race, Alli's trying to steal, or Horde Rogues/Druids trying to ninja skin the kill.
---
It is to me, lol. Especially considering I have to constantly fight the urge to create a rogue and shaman as well.
---
Damn I think I had this earlier when lvling but sold it off. Is there a guide or resource out there that can show me all the stuff that I should be selling on the AH. First time player here.
---
meanwhile i havnt seen truestrike shouldesr drop once in \~15 runs ;/
---
AoE frost farming chaps my ass so much I'll deliberately train packs of mobs through the blizzards of farmers I see doing it.
---
Same. I love boss fights where Frostbolt Ceuta three times in a row:)
---
Well I farmed the whelps in badlands exclusively from lvl 39-45 and didn‚Äôt get one so about that rare
---
Have to be on the ground to spam blizzard and cone of cold.
---
Create an alt to make them with a good name. People will pay more for a fancy shirt made by a character named Gucci or Armani or Costco
---
Pssh it's going to the kid with the highest DPS, IN MY FAMILY YOU EARN YOUR KEEP /s
---
LOL
---
Amen brudda, nothing worse than reserving things. Just run the instance and enjoy it.
---
I'm a warrior and I've ran BRD arena and anger for the respective chest and HoJ and not once have I reserved it. You're here for the same thing as I am? Awesome let's run it together and see if the RNG favours one of us better. In the end like you say it's about making those lasting friendships that'll endure not some item that will be replaced.
---
Alterac mountain is a great loop for iron and mithril.
---
Instead of jumping down to rotgrip, you can go back to the beginning of the bridge and drop down off the ledge onto the area below. From there, it's about 3 borer pulls and a rock patrol to tinker.
---
US servers? Don't recognise the server names.
---
HEY GUYS IM PICKLE RICKSHAW
---
Ranges from 20g -  40g. Maybe they'll go up in price once everyone is settled in?
---
&gt;This is pretty much from a financial perspective a confirmation.
---
Lmfao what?
---
Be careful out on that limb there buddy, it looks pretty wobbly.
---
Had someone ninja Devilsaur leather from me but it was my fellow alliance. I wouldn‚Äôt have even been mad if it was a horde because that‚Äôs how it goes.
---
I will say as a tank, my unsung blessing is having a smart mage who understands this and works with you on clumping mobs for nova and snares and knows how to kite mobs that get away from the pull.
---
They really should be using them more to get in shape for running away from ... well things.
---
PSA: if you're doing the 4th dragon for ony attunement, the fastest way to get there from emberstrife is capturing the alliance boat. too few horde now this
---
Logic and facts don't stop no circle jerk.
---
Yes, and MF is a very bad way of doing that. If anything, you'd be better off using smite or just wanding, MF is a terrible in-between.
---
Pally and Warrior theorycrafting discords have it around 3% or 0.67 to 0.75 PPM
---
That was amazing. I loved every second.
---
Yes you are correct. But them saying that bringing out TBC and Wotlk is now easy thanks to all the work that has been done with classic is to me just short of confirming it. Now there are still reasons not to do it, but I trust that the most important thing for Blizz is money.
---
SM gives a ton of money, great drops, and can be a destination for 16+ levels. It's also right in the Horde's backyard, half a zone away from a capital. 
---
Deadmines is almost two full zones away from the Alliance capital, and a short swim from Grom'gol. It's only a destination for about 5-7 levels, and there isn't a convenient central location to sit and camp, which is why Alliance doesn't camp the instance. 
---
Plus, Horde can just go run RFC, WC, and SFK instead of DM.
---
I think when you jump down into the water after Princess (where Rotgrip is) you can swim down a bit to tunnel that leads directly to right below Tinker. So you don‚Äôt need to clear the trash that‚Äôs up top of him. If I‚Äôm remembering that correctly.
---
Dude I know get some nasty crits with fire blast and CoC. Gotta love it.
---
Oh I completely agree.
---
I still always pick WPVP for some reason though... Even though I get literally nothing out of ganking people.
---
I think the very rare spontaneous team battle or 1v1 makes it worth it.
---
WPVP 100% caters to griefers though.
---
I'm really looking forward to BGs.
---
figured that out on level 55 enh shaman... the mana i wasted
---
I recently re-rolled engineering. Day 1 of it, i ran out of space in my bank and bags. So much crap that i have to have for it. lol
---
&gt;r doesn't mark ANY targets (and no, that IS the tank's job, not the party leader's)
---
I don't agree, whoever is leading is marking targets. The leader's job is tell people what to kill, what to cc, where to be, and if pats are comings etc that often defaults to the tank but as OP said, somebody else built the group/raid so why arent they leading?
---
Be more aggressive when you're tanking, tell them you need to get aggro for 5 seconds or more then AoE if you don't get the response your looking for then just leave, as a tank you'll get a group fast afterwords.
---
But thats what i classify as a 'meme-proc'.
---
How is OT picking her up in p3 when you said OT gets targeted with fireballs?
---
I understood that reference
---
yeah I could not even see the enemy mobs :D
---
Also pretty sure you were always in combat for Rend gauntlet, but now you break it every wave, and the whole thing is pretty much a joke.
---
The event takes so long due to having to wait for each wave.
---
It‚Äôs relative to what they are used for.
---
Ore is highly used for multiple professions where leather is used solely for leather working which is a limited prof to begin with.
---
Also the volume is an issue. Think of the number of skinable mobs vs. number of ore nodes.
---
Mining/herb will almost always sell for more.
---
Alright, you've convinced me that you're a moron. Congrats. You're being purposefully obtuse in order to avoid admitting a legitimate point you've been wrong about. You're now repeating yourself and arguing in circles. There's nothing more to be gained from this conversation.
---
Wtf did you just say to me?!  When I see you in game, your dead, kiddo!  ;P
---
Warrior raid slot is super crowded but in most super serious guilds most will be competing with rogues for 1handers. I‚Äôm trying to convince my GM to let me stay 2h for prio/less competition as we have 4+ rogue 4+ dps war competing for 1hs and only a couple hunters as needed. So I‚Äôd be hard prio as a 2h fury build üòé
---
It's probably because there's a larger demand for copper than light leather.  
---
People need copper for power leveling engineering, which people are probably starting to do in preparation for phase 2 (PvP patch).  They also need copper for blacksmithing but there aren't nearly as many blacksmiths as there are engineers.
---
Tin doesn't sell as much because whenever you basically need tin you also need copper (to create bronze).  You should see a pretty decent jump from tin to iron though.
---
I would definitely drop skinning for herbalism.  Potions (and their reagents) are only going to increase in price as more people hit 60 and need pots for raids (for today's and tomorrow's raids) and for PvP.
---
I do hope that blizzard finds a way to combat this. Offerring free or paid faction transfers from populated factions to the lesser populated factions could be an idea for example, but only in dire cases.
---
Imbalances are bound to happen however I don‚Äôt believe they should reach the point of many retail servers for the sake of ‚Äúno changes‚Äù.
---
Captain Tuubid.
---
I have herbs and alchemy on a level 20 alt. I think I'm up to 115 and 135 respectively. I just got to where I can craft stuff that makes a little money (like 20s per), but not that many sell in a given day. 
---
The lower level herbs sell to vendors for more than they do on the AH, so no money to be made there early on. My server is pretty busy, so big competition for herb nodes. I don't find all that many.
---
Ahh sorry brother just re-read the original post and I thought you said cluttered, not clustered. I use dominos to rearrange my bars / bag / menu etc.
---
As a healer I‚Äôve gone this stat weight:
---
Spirit -&gt; Int -&gt; Healing Power
---
People here acting like Spirit is useless, but at least for leveling as a healer, its beyond amazing.
---
Spirit regen mechanic:
---
Priest - 13 + (spirit/4) **mp2**
---
240 spirit at lv 35 (my priest) = 73 **mp2**
---
Spirit regen cooldown - After 5 seconds of no spell cast, regen (spirit regen) mp2. Will continue while casting (cast bar) and will start the 5 second counter as soon as the spell casts. Racials/0 mana cost do not seem to trigger the cooldown. 
---
You can also use this to your advantage, start casting your heal the moment you tick regen and you‚Äôll get a 2nd tick of mana before the heal casts.
---
Also, **if you are far enough away, you can heal + HoT and drink before you get put into combat**
---
Really?   We clear Molten core in ~2 hours I have every item I need from all current dungeons, all keys, Hydraxian quests done etc..   I think I'm fine.   And also you're wrong.   No one expects casters to buy manna biscuits to save 5 seconds between pulls if free mage water is available.   I lifetap to even out mana and recover both mana and HP.  I am always the first to recover resources.  I can cannibalize as well.   I know how to manage my resources.
---
Your attitude seems like it might be a problem tho.
---
All of those are US yes
---
It's a little more commonplace on my server, I managed to scoop the recipe cheap cuz someone didnt know. Typically, these types of shirts will get you nice profit margins, but not big profits, and not very quickly, I sell 1 or 2 of these shirts at a time for 2g and change on my server whenever I end up with some silk from somewhere, and they usually sell the first posting. 
---
As the servers age they may even go up in value with people having more gold to throw around, making more bank alts, etc.
---
Nearly spit out my coffee and I‚Äôm not even drinking coffee
---
Ok I agree but I been swinging a vendorstrike since 58 so I‚Äôm pimpin that big white damage swings already hahah
---
...again, if you derive pleasure from causing someone else to be unhappy, that's a sociopathic mindset almost by definition. Saying that the stakes are low so it doesn't matter is bullshit. Saying that the game allows you to do it is bullshit. If you enjoy causing other people to be unhappy, you're a shitty person. 
---
Some wPVP can be super fun. You can't have it without exposing yourself to the lowlife gankers of the world on a PVP server.
---
Horde can never fight one on one or anything near their lvl. All are delusonal neckbeard cowards. I see your blood on the streets clowns lol. Alliance will always be King.
---
Yeah, I'm honestly not sure what's going on with this. I don't have a good point of reference.
---
What?  Which horrible server are you on?  Almost every run I do ends with everyone saying thanks to each other.
---
I had a warlock whisper me the other night to say great tanking in a 5 man.  Since I was dpsing, I laughed and pointed him towards the warrior who‚Äôd been our (amazing) tank.  Nope, he‚Äôd already thanked that guy and was talking about me running to catch the odd add/lost mob.
---
its not an aura, its frost armor.
---
nice, this is great
---
VC on Gurubashi in vanilla as well.
---
yeah kind of pointless actually unless you can see the server list :(
---
Definitely a bug, as a lock I kited a lot while leveling and it felt like almost every mob had windfury. Princess also did a 6+ attack on me so I didn't bother anymore after a couple of kills.
---
I also got oneshotted by one of those nature elementals that have Trash in Felwood. After I feared it, it gave me like a 20 hit attack lol.
---
That actually makes sense now, since Forrester hearthsinger(?) Drops that dancing trinket, maybe it works to use that too? So u can aoe dance
---
Right, so it's a bug. If this could proc off of mindflay ticks it might be good for keeping out mana up during a fight, but it looks like on spellcast
---
Yea, the market for collectibles will prob take a while to grow
---
So, I was really excited to sink in the time for the quest chain required to get the skull. I hate polymorph and blinds. But when I saw the 30 sec timer cooldown when you equip it before you activate it i have to say I got really disappointed. Is it practical to wear this offhand all the time in the anticipation that you will get CC‚Äôd? I don‚Äôt know, i like my fast offhand constantly applying poisons on my rogue ...
---
Sorry a bit of a rant.
---
You can line of sight Arugal and negate most of his Void Bolts.
---
And it remains to be seen if classic is profitable in the long run for blizz
---
Back at launch I was killing gnolls in the Hogger ariea, and invite a guy who was doing the same quest, so we could easily kill the big groups, and he /y "NO" at me. I'm thinking wtf is the point of playing an mmo......
---
Man, I'm always looking for VC.
---
[Fortunate Son Intensifies]
---
The same thing happened to me last night in the Hinterlands, a Druid tried to gank me and he tried to turn tail and run as soon as I started unloading spells onto him and he realized he made a mistake. I love it when people underestimate shadow priests.
---
Thanks man. I‚Äôve heard of the 6k mana but didn‚Äôt think to get Arcane Brilliance. 
---
At level 56 and Shadow, I only have like 4500 mana so even with the disc +10% I‚Äôll need a lot more intellect gear.
---
Specifically you, look at the mirror.  You'd get a lot more help if you come across nicer.
---
What are priest's best support spells? Other than healing and DPS spells, what are some good niche support spells? For example, the other day I did uldaman the first time and someone asked for a disease cure, which I didn't have. He said that was fine and that diseases aren't really an issue until a higher level range. Is there anything like this I should keep in mind? Another one I have wondered about is Shackle Undead; useful in corner cases, or too niche?
---
oh, leash. yeah, thats the word xD
---
Not just any hunter, a nelf male hunter. 90% is up to some dumb shit
---
Profression related question.
---
I'm about to hit 60 on my Rogue and I took alch/herb and will probably drop one for engineering when phase 2 hits.
---
I am going to level up a Druid on a different accout and the same server (horde pvp).
---
Should I drop herbalism on the Rogue and have the Druid do the gathering? The Rogue will probably stay my main. Does it not matter who does the gathering if I will have both Rogue and Druid out in the world together?
---
Well I can't argue with that.
---
I'm pretty sure you're supposed to hearth actually
---
If you just say LFM DM you‚Äôll get 20 whispers asking what wing, just like if you say LFM SM.
---
You don't play shadowpriest for pve. It's garbage at pve due to mana inefficiency. You play shadowpriest because they are beastly duelers in pvp.
---
If pve worries you as a shadow priest, no offense but I think you're setting yourself up for failure. It won't ever be satisfying in pve.
---
Maybe it was a regional thing then. Im on EU and saw mainly VC.
---
All true, thanks. I use it for PvE leveling on a Sub/Ass build where I won't be using gouge/blind all that much (I hardly use gouge at all), and if I use blind, I'll normally will throw it on a mob I haven't attacked yet for CC (unexpected add). It's good bonus damage in addition to Instant Poison.
---
Free action potion, iron grenades, ice reflector trinket, you need to put in the research and effort to farm some consumables, but you can beat a mage if you play well
---
I knew all these mages were kids!
---
Tanks are much less likely to be flamed, since groups don't want to find another tank.
---
I have been leveling a warrior and a rogue together, and I see so much more hate thrown at DPS players, even if the tank or healer is at fault for the wipe.
---
Sko, rhymes with bro.
---
Lo, rhymes with bro too.
---
Mance, rhymes with dance.
---
Does ignore do anything when you can physically see the person?
---
Hackers, um.. Find a way?
---
That‚Äôs like me and RFC.
---
(Rolled Alliance for the first 3ish years I played)
---
and funner!
---
Chimpanzees can do tribute runs?
---
Alright, thank you for the advice.
---
Seriously, people need to understand this is completely viable. You just need to make your healers aware its coming. Onyxia doesnt hit THAT hard. Pop a greater stoneskin and throw on a shield in the same macro. Easy peazy.
---
They need to go back to school...omance.
---
How did you kill her without keybinds?
---
Wow, imagine being this ass-blasted because someone plays a spec you don't like
---
Another fun trick is to fear a few of their mobs out of blizzard. Works with priest and warlock too
---
If you're bad at tanking, this is the sign.
---
Definitely have to get this, thanks for the suggestion.
---
Who gives a fuck about China?
---
I believe it is Hamish
---
alliance definitely more warlike and aggressive
---
horde are the noble savages fam
---
Why would a level 18 in Westfall be looking to join a dire maul group anyway?
---
Battle of Winterfell vibes.
---
How would I adapt the macro to not have the alt option?
---
UPCLASSICS TO THE LEFT BOYS
---
Does this require the other healer to also have the addon?
---
Luna does this for anyone else who has luna installed. But if they lack luna you can't see the heals.
---
I just do it when I want to... because I like it :P
---
This is honestly not a sarcastic comment : the quickest way to get the compendium is to buy it on the auction house. Or , obviously you can live in Dire Mail. How much is your time worth? What else could you be doing with that time? Is it faster to hope for a very rare zone drop, or farm the gold to purchase it?
---
Ya. I 2h tanked on my warrior through most of ZF, and it was easy as long as you let the healer know. Aggro was very good and my damage was really high (Sweeping Strikes). 
---
The problem with it can be if you get new warriors who just sit in zerker, don't taunt strays and don't really know what to do, but in general it's very viable.
---
Don‚Äôt heal life tap damage unless you have excess mana
---
Quality Rust reference. I actually quit a week before classic launch to come back to WoW
---
Is the Dire Maul release global or does EU get it the 16th?
---
I thought you were supposed to hearth to a city and run to the AH.
---
Grass is greener on the other side. Spent lots of gold on lvling LW (even tho I have skinning) and I haven‚Äôt made any profit at all. Wish I did herblore and alchemy instead.
---
It's kinda arbitrary what changes people are going to be alright with or not, so I guess the safest way is to be as authentic as possible.
---
I feel like an element that wasn't touched on in the analysis is the impact of Windfury proc's (on the horde side anyways) and how the Thrashes can also proc additional WF hits. This makes it an excellent sword to use when dungeoning/raiding with a Shaman in your party.
---
Oh sick, more addons to help people not play the game. Just what we needed.
---
As with everything, it depends on the level you want to play at. If you want to main tank a raid, (1) it‚Äôs too late, and (2) you need to be warrior. If you want to pump dungeons, Druid is fine.
---
And yet I‚Äôve never met a horde who understood the meaning of a fair fight.
---
Healbot will show incoming heals as well.
---
The priest icon looks weird in this image
---
Funny thing is I main a mage lol
---
&gt; again, if you derive pleasure from causing someone else to be unhappy, that's a sociopathic mindset almost by definition.
---
Then the whole fucking server is designed to be socoipathic so if that's not your thing then go to another server. Any sort of pvp is going to cause someone else to be unhappy. I can lose a fair 1v1 world pvp but still be "unhappy" that now my time is wasted running back to my body when i can be questing/grinding. 
---
&gt;If you enjoy causing other people to be unhappy, you're a shitty person.
---
No, if you join a pvp server and then complain about that very thing that server is dedicated to you're a shit person. Everyone gets fucking ganked the game is two factions at war not sharing cups of fucking tea with each other. 
---
Go play Hello Kitty Island Adventure

well instead of taking the uc portal and flying to arathi the fastest way to get to the wetlands is just getting on the ship from dustwallow. you'll arrive in menethil earlier and save a ton of time
---
These situations are why you keep the Rank 1 of your rez spell handy.
---
Lol, YUP! I actually just hit 54 and crafted myself 3 pieces of Stormshroud for the set bonus (2% chance to gain 30 Energy on melee attack). I haven't been able to try it out yet, but I'm stoked about it.
---
 2% doesn't sound like a lot, but with fast daggers or a fast fist weapon OH (1.50-1.80), Slice &amp; Dice, the Troll racial, and Windfury...I think it's gonna be really nice in the upcoming dungeons. Oh! And there's a 1.30 speed dagger  from DM that'll be available this week.
---
The meta is elementary.
---
You'll be doing a ton of dispelling in raids to remove magic debuffs.  For many raid fights, 80% of the battle is just priests dispelling debuffs.  In PvP, you can dispel shields, blessings, buffs, fears, etc.  It's incredibly powerful so make sure it's bound.
---
Shackle Undead is very useful in Stratholme and Scholomance (later dungeons in Eastern and Western Plaguelands).  Be prepared to use it if the situation arises!
---
This only applies to the yellow non aggressive citizens, not any of the undead packs
---
Drop herb on rogue, get engi.
---
Alchemy is profitable by itself if you buy when mats are low (non-primetime) and sell when potions are high (raid reset days on primetime).
---
Use an addon or spreadsheet to keep track of this.
---
In other MMOs (and even back in early vanilla WoW) they were always DDs, just like that, for damage dealers. Over time the term has changed to DPS, as people started logging and using meters much more commonly where DPS is measured and laid out by person, and it's just become the default term for that role.
---
Healing add-ons that play the game for you are the real vanilla experience, though. Modern add-ons will never automate as much as the vanilla Healbot did.
---
Don‚Äôt be so mad sweaty
---
Leveling as shadow is a lot faster then otherwise so I would obviously stick to that regardless
---
It just means I'll enjoy throwing DoTs and my Succubus on you even more when I find you.
---
Imagine logging in on your rogue every day and still spelling it rouge.

---
Hey Ever, sorry I missed this!
---
I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre taking these matters into serious consideration, this server is great and it takes every one of us to keep it that way. Your hard work keeps the server healthy, and it doesn‚Äôt go unnoticed.
---
I promise to keep putting up a fight where, and when I can. 
---
See you on the battlefield!
---
thats called a battleground dude, go join a pve server
---
You can hit 60 without doing those zones anyways.  Or go holy at 55/56 and heal / spam holy nova on 'em.
---
I think most people know this. Every group I lead and that I‚Äôve been in, before using my strategy above, basically had every warrior fight for aggro in P3.
---
Depends. Is mayonnaise an instrument?
---
At least 2 or 3 times my LBRS groups have wiped due to extra packs pulling, and absolutely *no one* could tell how or why they pulled.  Knowing this, I now think it was probably my fault...
---
There's nothing wrong with the LFG classifieds tool, its dungeon finder and it's features that people have a problem with.
---
Feel free to do /dance /shoot while your at it
---
You probably 1) never played alliance on classic and 2) are really bad at PvP
---
Easy doesn't mean it's happening. It would have been much easier for Blizzard to just use the 1.12 client and server software but they didn't.
---
You need one to use slamspec effectively, as the animation and combat text are not reliable indicators.
---
In scholo a majority of the bosses can be kicked/stunned. Bring a rogue and you can keep some bosses stunlocked for 10+ seconds.
---
The problem has never been threat generation. It's damage mitigation and gear itemization that work against druids. A lot of healers aren't good with volatility because they are reactionary and even a well played druid tank will be dropped.
---
Deadmines is DMSouth
---
That‚Äôs still off-tanking though. The warrior is the main tank‚Äîhe is getting the items the main tank needs. The druid is the off-tank, and he tanks some fights. I hope that made sense. MT isn‚Äôt a matter of who is the designated tank for a given fight, it‚Äôs a role that doesn‚Äôt change. When the OT is assigned to a certain boss, he‚Äôs still the OT.
---
Yeah sometimes i get one or two people from guilds in the group but then to fill the group i'm back to "lookingforgroup".
---
I'm not saying i want everyone to be teleported instantly to the dungeon or anything because that is game breaking but it would look nicer with an LFG window its basically the same!
---
Well I got to 50 with way too many quests that I can possibly finish. Planning to dungeon my way from here to 60 for pre-bis anyway so I think Im okay. But thanks for advice, Ive heard that sentiment before.
---
Silithus farming good?  I've been making a killing in EPL.
---
With no wand specialisation or spirit tap there could be mana issues aplenty. I play holy/disc so no experience of that exact build, perhaps someone else knows better?
---
Sure he didn‚Äôt offer the transmute?
---
Reminds of one time leveling an ally alt doing the defias courier quest in Westfall. After searching for like 10 minutes I find the courier tagged and aggroed to a level 40 something. I wait and figure Ill catch the respawn but this dude isn‚Äôt even fighting it, just holding the tag/aggro and I‚Äôm not waiting for that shit so I attack it.
---
He says ‚Äúwait, don‚Äôt kill‚Äù so I ask for an inv.  He invites and I see he‚Äôs waiting on 3 people who are all across the continent. One guy in red Ridge, one in stormwind etc... figure okay guess I can wait. 5 or so minutes pass...bout to die from this courier aggroed on me and the 40 won‚Äôt take it back. So I said fuck it I‚Äôm killing it. Looted quest item and left. Afterward they all sent me some love letters in PM. To me, it‚Äôs like, how entitled are you to think you can reserve a quest mob for 20 minutes? It‚Äôs not even a long respawn, you can easily just kill it when everyone‚Äôs actually there.
---
Oh, no. I was a cat that often wished he were a rogue. Likewise, a bear wanting to be a prot warrior.
---
i'm uninstalling
---
Dire Maul probably won't be a patch. They don't need to update anything clientside to enable it.
---
There is a shadow skin in each scholomance dungeon next to lady barov. You need two of them for your Libram enchant.
---
Look at your comment history lmao.
---
I mean, for me personally i only did the whelp grind for a few hours (about a level and a half 39-40).
---
LF group for voice chat
---
Send him a USPS letter: "I know what you did 10 years ago"
---
How is it worse? How else are you going to find a group?
---
One way around it:
---
"Want to roll for bindings?  1000g.    Want to reserve them?  10000g. 
---
 Both per run, payable up front, non-refundable if they don't drop."
---
Then say what wing it is in your LFM barker.
---
&gt; Then the whole fucking server is designed to be socoipathic by your fucking ridiculous standard
---
It's not a fucking ridiculous standard. Do you derive enjoyment from making other people's lives miserable? Or do you just make excuses to yourself about how some lowbie signed up for you to spawn camp them for 2 hours when they signed up for a PVP server?
---
It's sociopathic behavior to find it *fun* to hurt others. 
---
The server is designed to give *freedom*. The freedom includes the ability to act like a real jackass. You don't *have to* do it. It's not designed to *make you* do it. 
---
&gt;Any sort of pvp is going to cause someone else to be "unhappy".
---
No, absolutely not. It's possible to lose, to die, and have a good time. If you're invading Stormwind to kill the King and I'm fighting and dying, I'm having a blast. If I'm trying to go into Molten Core and spontaneous wPVP breaks out between two raid groups, I'm having a *blast*. If I'm trying to grind random drop quest items in Badlands and some level 60 comes over and just starts murdering me, I'm not having fun, and he's only having fun because he knows that he's depriving me of enjoyment from the game. That guy has some sociopathic tendencies. It's not normal or healthy to get your enjoyment from making other people suffer.
---
He cannot fathom a round earth and trying to do so causes him rage.
---
Big yikes.
---
Tomorrow, Tomorrow, it's only a day away!!
---
That is exactly what i'm saying :). I love having to group together and make our way to the dung, wouldnt want to tele there and back.
---
That's the only place I've seen a GM spawn and lay waste to a bunch of us post-ZG. I don't even remember what we were doing to get them to interact with us in game but it was a fun time. Would wipe again.
---
Alts and twinking are the usual option. Onyxia ZG and AQ20 are options that are puggable if you don‚Äôt want a dictated schedule
---
Because the dad's dead and shes trying to hold threat on the mobs to buy time for the kids to dps the mobs down to prevent the wipe?
---
AoE frost farmers come into a corner of the map and literally do nothing but wrangle up every mob, node, and herb that exists for hours. They can fuck right off and I honestly hope the gospel of How To Fuck Up Their Routine spreads further.
---
I got one killed in northern WPL earlier after I dragged a pack of Scarlet Paladins into his blizzard. 
---
AoE Frost Mages only want one thing, and it's fucking disgusting.
---
Decent comic, bad source material, FUCK stonetoss
---
I just put a cookie on my desk for every run I do, then eat em after the hours up. Win win.
---
... why would you want wand spec or spirit tap for PvP?
---
Level an alt, work on profs, grind gold, or quit? Idk what else to tell you man
---
You could run for President at this point
---
counterpoint: rogue rotations and the usage or lack thereof for SND. Also spec matters a fair amount and I know everyone didn't have that figured out or read about it.
---
or laid
---
Woosh on you, may be I came ofg a little bit too sincere -__-
---
Will you be doing flurry axe?
---
With a window specifically designed for it, we can even call it... "looking for group"
---
You ok buddy?  Any tingling sensations in your left arm or anything?
---
Useful if running Rend farming with fewer people.
---
As a tank I always appreciate feedback, and I think encouragement all around is a how group successfully runs.
---
It‚Äôs not a fun trip but you‚Äôre at the level to quest in alterac/hillsbrad/arathi anyway, and could just find one of the other myriad groups running SM. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs really all that rude.
---
The way I look at it:  QOL should be in immediately.  "Content," particularly progressive content, should be gated.
---
This makes sense now I was wondering why the ubrs bosses were squishy af
---
I see no V in the dead and no C in Mines. No other dungeon is named after the boss so makes no sense doing it to the first alliance dungeon.
---

---
But then sometimes the tank initiates a pull by charging at a group that's 500 feet from the healer, who has 1/4 mana and is sitting down drinking, and then the group wipes
---
I feel like making alts is just kicking the can down the road and I saw pretty much the entire leveling curve while leveling so it's not like it'll feel all that different. Part of why I don't want to do onyxia is because attunement seems really tedious.
---
I did use a Mod Mail I think, I can make an image and send it via imgur I guess, but if you can find it UtsunomiyaPhil answered me. I'll copy paste:
---
I wanted a clarification on this after recent thread closures using this rule. What clarifies as content related to classic regarding content creators? If I upload a video about a streamer organizing a huge pvp event, a raid fight or similar thing its fine but it's not fine if the streamer engages in a behaviour that could lead to drama inside the game systems ( ex. ninjaing, corpse farming ecc)? The rule isn't really clear on that since as far as I can tell we're all content creators, them included, so I'd like to see it specified if it's just a case of drama content being banned but the examples I said earlier being fine to upload/post. Thank you for your time.
---
from UtsunomiyaPhil[M]  /r/classicwow sent 7 days ago
---
If the post is "xxxstreamer cleared Onyxia with 5 people and this is how they did it!" Typically those are fine. If it is "xxxstreamer just ninja'ed random boe purple or random item that is not intended for their class/spec" or "xxxstreamer hates xxxstreamer2" then that is streamer drama imo.

---
Alright then I understood it right, thanks for the clarification and good work!
---
aside from it not being confirmed...  
---
we dont know that they would even let us use our classic characters in the first place
---
Thanx for making a video :)
---
I've never really had good luck with Ele in PvP from BC - MOP.  The problem for me was that everything has a cast time and you don't have particularly amazing CC and melee just eats you up.  Everyone seems to be saying Ele is the spec to go on Reddit though so I assume these people have a different personal experience than me.
---
Oh yeah true
---
56, since emperor is 59. Otherwise it would be difficult to keep aggro and the emperor would just wreck.
---
Saw this happen a few days ago, still happening.
---
What is fused wiring used for and where does it drop?  Just target dummies?
---
&gt;for 3 hours multiple times a week sounds horrible,
---
we have 1 raid plus Onyxia..  that is 3 hours ONCE a week.   (2 hours if you are in a top guild)
---
You can give me your stuff?
---
What? If it's a bug it should be fixed obviously. They are trying to replicate vanilla as much as possible, so if UBRS is incorrect, then it's need to be changed, regardless of some people getting "fucked" over.
---
Me Paladin. Me trying to keep tank up. Me see mage's health dip slightly. "Oh no I must immediately snap-heal with my highest level of Holy Light or that cloth-clad simpleton is gonna die"
---
I‚Äôm not asking for help. Never once did. Just ask people to be nice and this is what I get lol
---
Arsenic is an element, not a compound. Elements are absolutely a thing, you may have heard of the periodic table.
---
Well its kind of the nature of mmos right. You persist through something tedious or time-consuming like grinding mobs, instances, levels, materials, etc to gain something rewarding in return such as gear, gold, mounts, titles, whathaveyou. 
---
Perhaps you could find a way to make the grind more fun for you. If its boring you, listen to an audio book, or challenge yourself such as being the top healer of your raid team.
---
After the initial learning phase there is exactly 2-3 hours of raid content total available. What are all of you guys planning on doing for the other 9 hours per week?
---
That sucks, my guild in vanilla folded on lotheb. We were still laughing and having a good time raiding, but we got stuck on that mother fucker, and a priest missed his heal in the rotation which caused an under 5% wipe. MT was fed up and most of the guild management was on his shoulders, so he quit the next day. Our only tfury warrior quit and our guild kinda tanked over the next few months until BC.
---
If you have time I highly recommend this very in-depth guide https://youtu.be/dKgQ4pP7EL0

Here is a little video of my character progressing from 1 to 60, I tried to capture all the places and zones I went to.

On the last run of SM we group with a fire mage and hell all the party love it and praisse hil for his choice, i guees we are all sicks of frost mages
---
Yeah i did last night, was a lot of fun, having to teleport there from booty bay because i'm horde was very cool too.
---
I'm so stingy with my water that I often have party members trading it to me mid instance. I can't afford to be out there buying stacks of water.
---
Honestly I find shit just happens and while the tank has to be perfect 100% of the time when shit does happen I care more about not wiping and then if a wipe will likely happen then doing as much use as possible. E.G trying to pick off a key mob or a low health mob or two so we don't all die with the entire pack at 5% then go back to full and we've made no difference.
---
Also I believe there is subreddit now dedicated to r/kevin
---
Disc with a pinch of holy and shadow is the best leveling spec to 42 when you switch to shadow for the form
---
gotta get those reckless death wish'd sexecute hits in

So why not tell people to search before asking dumb questions?
---
Precisely.
---
Good fucking luck. These magetards see mobs and cant wait to nova, coc, blizzard, and w/e else they have.

I spent two hours trying to do it one day, then tried the next day and got it first try.

I read the  name as "doinitslow" for some reason and was wondering wtf I wasn't getting.

Mmm yeah that's just annoying enough imo.

It's not quite that clear cut. The value is multiplied greatly due to the rarity. I understand it's a new economy, but I couldn't sell this for anything close to amount that could be farmed easily in an hour or two. That being said, I'm just gonna learn it and make some stupid shirts haha.

That's not killing someone to make them miserable because making them miserable is fun to you. That's doing something with a purpose.
---
&gt; allow mod to remove posts that should be in that thread
---
A bunch of those politics posts were up for hours after being reported. Mods are volunteers and can't really be expected to be looking here 24/7.
---
I mean, it might help. I'm sure one or two people will post in a thread like that. But I don't think the majority of people would pay much attention to it, as far as knowing that they should be posting there goes.
---
That was common knowledge 15 years ago though.  How times change.

As arkhound said, you walk back to the start of the bridge and drop left onto the path below.

Fall damage takes around 90% of your HP, so be careful not to land on the patrol. After that, its one rock giant and a handful of borers to tinker.

so generally speaking its not worth to go for example 12(or even higher) weapon skill + above hitcap?

I knew it as VC on my server back in vanilla.
---
Yeah I am a huge fan of the warlock mount. Was amazing on my gnome back in the day and I never bought a different one. But my orc looked so bad on the lvl 40 mount that I have zero regrets about spending a little more money for an epic wolf.
---
Tanks are always derps. It's 2-handed tanking the entire game to 60 with zero threat-increasing abilities used.
---
Restart your computer, update drivers, reinstall twitch, run it as administrator. Idk, some suggestions
---
Is there an addon to click through mobs that have been designated by the raid(skull,moon)
---
The Nativity Scene!
---
My mage alt's mount ain't gonna buy itself.
---
Seriously as a tank, bless you. I can't tell you how annoying it is when I am grouped with mages who insist on only using their AOE cooldowns (CoC, Frost Nova, Blizzard) the entire dungeon even on groups of 2-3. These guys are drinking after every pull while our healer is sitting at 80%+ mana.
---
Thanks for the comment. Why do you only post 1 or 2 at a time?
---
Str and stam are for leveling.  For lowlevel dungeons, just go stam and int
---
What? Jajaja
---
We have to, because they have the quintessences

I am on a layered high pop server that will support hundreds of DM runs per day. Books will be on the auction house within hours. Not at reasonable prices, but they will be there.
---
I don‚Äôt think books get dropped because warriors are farming for Quel‚ÄôSerrar, I think books get dropped because everyone will be running DM period. That‚Äôs thousands of players who will be able to roll on it but don‚Äôt need to use it.

In response to your pointless personal attack, I am level 60 and wish all the content would be released instantly so I can finish the game as quickly as possible.

Oof, that hurts :(

I've always seen Deadmines abbreviated to VC and Dire Maul as DrM, or DM North, East, West if people were specific on the wing

Most of the modern UI wasn't in vanilla, and addons were mostly unrestricted so you could have all these features implemented in lua. Instead we get nothing :|
---
What level should dps start zf
---
So this may sound salty, but whatever. I'm on a busy PvP realm, and now I honestly don't know a single reason to be on one. 
---
You can PvP on PvE server. In fact, PvP is better on PvE server, since you're engaging with people that are actually playing the same game as you. 
---
There is no honor sysem right now, so mechanics wise there is no point in engaging in it. This means, that it is simply the wiser choice to let the other faction quest in peace, and expect the same - which is exactly what happens for 80% of the time. 
---
This is why the "experience the danger and feel like the world is alive" - reason people give in favor of PvP-servers makes no sense whatsoever. Nobody actually plays that way, because it's actually just needless to play that way. 
---
This in turn means, that PvP on "PvP-servers" takes place only, when someone outnumbers, outlevels you, or you're busy fighting mobs, and they think that makes them great or sth. 
---
Pick PvP if you like fighting when your opponents can't fight back  and ambushing people heading to dungeons, that sort of thing.
---
The Thursday Loot Thread on /r/wow is pretty well utilized, so I think a ton of people would definitely use it.  The biggest question, as you mentioned, is whether it would actually make an impact on the deluge of new threads about every single minor accomplishment people see in-game.  I don't think it will solve the problem, but I think it might help.
---
okay
---
Yes! You'd think they'd notice after awhile, I sometimes let them enjoy their new friend for a couple seconds before taunting him to me. It's also important to know there's a 10s cool down on Taunt, so I can only save them at a fixed rate.
---
Haven't downloaded any new addons lately, and just today this is the first time these icons have been showing up. TIA!

Can you even accept summon while feared?

Aggro: I‚Äôm not sure if the exact conditions, but I used to kill alliance mages on my rogue farming cauldrons in vanilla by gathering up stuff and vanishing next to them. It also didn‚Äôt work every time so maybe they were tagging them somehow.

well "real" in that they have a spec thats supposed to be able to tank.

I remember seeing it called DM and VC on Nathrezim, but I was Horde so its not like it came up often.

People referring to DM as VC are definitely a minority. You never refer to a dungeon by a boss name. Anyone for CR? No? - RFK? Ooooh of course!
---
&gt; when they know for a fact they can rerelease tbc and wotlk and people will happily pay the sub for it

Didn't stop them from not making Classic until people yelled at them.

Other people have said that, ill have a look for it, i thought blizz had banned add ons like this because it isnt in the spirit of classic.
---
hi, am a bear druid who played warrior like 10 times on private servers
---
aside from whatever else has been said elsewhere, bears seem to be easier to heal in a somewhat counterintuitive way. the may be a bit spikier at times, but the simple thicc health pool enables healers to respond better in the sense that they generally end up taking less overhealing and thus less wasted mana
---
the total amount of mana spent seems to be pretty even regardless of what class is being healed
---
50 for Sunken Temple. Many classes have class quests there which they get at 50
---
I think this one is safe because it just parses chat. You still have to whisper people and put a group together as usual. It rules and I love it.
---
I dont think you can. They will top off every person you put rejuv on so thats a waste. I've resigned myself to main tank healing and ignoring meters for the most part.
---
True, but some classes require fairly constant input on rotations, even for leveling mobs. I need to be able to do things like pat her back with my dominant hand while auto attacks kill the mob after some initial setup.
---
So far Hunter has worked well, about 30 seconds of setup with hand on mouse, followed by 30 - 45 seconds of pet and auto attack doing the rest for most leveling mobs where I can use my hand to do other things.
---
you can fuck right off
---
I hope this is in classic, so casuals can get a lotus too
---
ive been asked to main tank mc 5 weeks in a row. its happening my man
---
This post's format is absolutely horrific on mobile
---
THANK YOU! I was about to disable everything and go through one by one. Appreciate it.
---
Sold! Getting it tonight.
---
Wow, you really are the comma police, huh? Get life.
---
if you cant finish everything (mc + 2x ony) in less than 3 hours a week, you're doing it wrong
---
What addon is that for those party frames?
---
Allies are pretty skilled though and server would melt with just the allies with the insane amount of players in it, so there is no way that you can make those numbers really count on large battles.
---
Main reason for going oom is because people try to aoe the ogres, resulting in new ones constantly spawning and attacking random targets. Healing one tank is soo much easier than healing 5 different people.
---
Classic was the proof of concept now we have it and all the work they did on classic set them up for tbc and wotlk with a fraction of the work.   It's a no brainer dude
---
Success requires taking risks. And also,  I think expansions would either be a direct failure by making them the only option (people want vanilla too!) or an indirect failure by making separate servers for it that eventually divide the playerbase into too many groups and spread it too thin.
---
Day care :)
---
what a cancer of a person you are lol.
---
I feel like I‚Äôm seeing Joe Rogan everywhere now. Even watched an old workaholics episode and the whole episode was one Rogan reference after the other.
---
Respect. But I don't think 'everyone' has the fully researched/tried alternative builds. The level of customization &amp; depth within the rogue trees is massive. I know I would be bored AF just autoattacking and using SS/Evis all the time. I think rogues need to branch out and break away from the meta and realize there's different &amp; better ways to play Classic...the concept of 'meta' didn't exist during Vanilla, and personally, it was better that way.
---
&gt;  but ive noticed that ren just gets deleted now 
---
that means hes summoned at the wrong time

---
Just check the AH for cheap gear with strength, Stan and intellect, don‚Äôt worry about enchanting them. Minor speed to boots would be valuable to have on any character for a flat 8% movement speed. As for weapons, I would invest in a new, slow two-handed weapon and every few levels, as it is the main output of your damage. 
---
If you still have excess gold to spend, buy scrolls of Strength/Agility, elixirs, mana and healing potions, sharpening stones and food buffs.
---
I see. Then it might actually be warlock since it has a pet, paladin since all they do is auto attack (forgive me fellow paladins) or priest to a certain degree (they wand a ton)
---
That wouldn't be a bad call. Or even a pally/shaman. The bonus utility  of all 3 of those classes would be fantastic too. MC, stuns, LoH/BoP, totems. All those are fantastic bonuses.
---
Rule number 1 in our guild and raids is if you in any way shape or form link a dps meter into chat, you are gone. No ifs and or buts. I find meters breed toxicity. Wow is a game. Its supposed to be fun. If you use a meter to analyze and improve your own performance, that's great. I'm not treating my raiders like they have meet a certain lv of dps or healing. It's a game, not a job.
---
Should have no scoped
---
Questie update, it's a new HUD
---
I can't even get my guildies to help me with this quest. Time to find a new guild...
---
There is a recipe for Greater Arcane Elixir up on the AH on my server for 300g, so I calculated that at current reagent prices I would need to sell 66 of them (with a net profit of 4.5g) to make the money back. But I don't know how often they sell! Should I buy it?
---
Way to many to list.  Was there something specific you were looking at?

Hi, /u/GoldImpling

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dhtx28/stat_weights_for_pawn/). 
---
You should play what you enjoy, that's honestly all there is to it. If you're having fun with the warrior then stick with it, if not then switch. You said one of your biggest problems with the warrior is not wearing plate like you'd like but neither do the other classes you mentioned so I'm not sure what exactly you're looking for. If you want to play warlock or mage instead then go for it. Mage will have a ton of competition for gear just like warrior does so if that really is a big deal for you then warlock likely won't have anywhere near as much. Basically if you don't want much gear competition then you go for warlock, hunter, or druid. In the MC pugs I've done so far there's typically about 4 warlocks, 3 hunters, and only 1 or 2 druids.
---
Because it doesn't matter how tanky you are when you don't have aggro
---
In BRD if you put beers down at the beginning of the instance you can clear a bunch of patrons out of the bar to make some space or just to make your party confused when the guzzling train comes.
---
When the beer is far away it doesn't just pull one or two it can pull a whole gaggle of them.
---
Yeah, I've skipped it unintentionally. I wanted to max out on faction reputations and there are barely any alliance quests out there.
---
weird keybinds
---
Absolute can and should quest.
---
My bad, is Striker's Mark on hunters a better example?
---
Looks quite clean and tidy. Damage meter would be a bit too bigfor me, but otherwise is is somewhat similar to my setup:
---
https://i.imgur.com/SXiMiGy.jpg
---
Thanks for link. Stoked i got to read about that 5 years later. Tanking ubrs in leather is a kevin move for sure.
---
So you want to re-roll because you aren't wearing full plate and have competition over gear?  Then you then ask if you should do mage or warlock instead of classes you think are meme specs, but also worry you want something easy to gear?
---
I am having a hard time coming up with the response you are looking for you are all over the place.
---
1.  If you are worried about falling behind on gear etc, then stick with your current level 60 and spec that time itemizing instead of leveling a new character.
---
2.  If you are worried about having to mix and match gear (leather, mail, plate) and don't want to do that, then you have to play a clothie or a tank.  Everyone else mixes and matches everything to get optimal setups.  Paladin tier gear isn't even good for any spec for example.  Ret needs plenty of leather and mail, holy / spell power paladins wear tons of cloth for example.   Classic.
---
3.  Ultimately, just suck it up and stick with the warrior would be my final word.  Keep a set of platemail for pvp, mix and match for pve.  You say yourself "While I do like the gameplay", just focus on that, thats 80% of the battle.

Theres a non-zero chance of causing cnfusion by typing "DM". There's a 0.00% chance of causing confusion by using "VC".

Typing two letters and then shift clicking everyone's name to ensure they weren't confused is more work than typing two different letters that are next to each other on the keyboard...

Dumb comments like this are why hunters are ninjaing them left and right.
---
Same.  As a hunter I had 36% speed with cheetah so it wasn't THAT big of an upgrade.  Plus the 3 seconds it takes to mount makes it so that you need to be going at least like 80 yards away for mounting up to be better than just popping cheetah.
---
Add-on. BagNon amongst others. Forgot which one I use but BagNon is popular. 
---
You should really get the twitch app for addons tho

You can respec by shame or maybe do a request
---
That‚Äôs all it is. I‚Äôm not really complaining, to be honest. I just finished up STV and the feelings of accomplishment and relief are very gratifying. More than anything, it just makes me appreciate what the alliance go through more as being exclusively horde gave me a skewed view of the factions. I always thought alliance players were more aggressive and malicious‚Äîbut no longer. And if they are, I can‚Äôt say I blame them. It feels pretty unfair sometimes.
---
Hey all, 
---
Very casual level 29 warlock here, I have been using a staff since early levels but just unlocked The ability to create a firestone. Should i stick with a staff or switch to a 1hand weapon with stone in off hand now that i have this ability unlocked? Thanks in Advance for any advice that can be provided.
---
If you ride this mount its an instant flag that says youre bad. Can be silenced, spell locked, cursed etc etc... get a normal mount.
---
The correct way to use your abilities as a hunter is to "weave" them between auto shots.
---
In essence a hunter fires their bow in 0.5 seconds, but then stands there doing nothing for the remained of the swing timer. In that downtime you can use your yellow abilities without reducing your white DPS. The key is to avoid "clipping" your white damage - for example if you are still Charing aimed shot when your swing timer starts again, your character will wait until after aimed shot finishes to fire your white shot.
---
So the hunter rotation is about weaving aimed shot, multi shot and your other abilities in between your white attacks.nyoy can get add-ons which show you your swing timer on screen. And you want a slow enough weapon to weave aimed shot.
---
So to answer your question. Yes you should train most of your good yellow abilities - you don't need all of them, for example most stings aren't worth it other than serpent - they will only improve your DPS so long as you weave them correctly.
---
my basic point is
---
people suck, with practice or just common sense/some previosu experience: sure it makes money. but most are so bad they need every advantage including full eagle gear and an epic mount with 100s of pots.
---
now ive always had bad luck with resists, so when i was doing the 2 pull method, the first pull would almost always require me to snap. and cuz i started off with like 5200 mana, i always needed too mana gem+evo atleast a little bit if i didnt get a single clear casting. so by the second pull i was basically out of cooldowns (cept gem ofc) and if theyd resist on the 2nd pull i was absolutely fucked, so i adopted the reset spots too be a way to wait out the nova cd while not wasting mana (when you got low low mana, every lil bit counts). on top of that block pulling is shit compared too using the mount, cuz mount lets you stack em directly on top of eachother so theyre less likely to get outside of the blizz's aoe. but this imo is largely preference
---
I killed some while waiting for Ony raid, no luck.

---
Not while in combat?
---
SM is actually amazing on Hunters
---
It can be more interactive if you seal twist but other than that the most complex it gets is seal, judge, seal, downranked consecration. You can get by just fine with just autoattacking with a seal up, though.

Yeah, the big gap is AoE. Druids have AoE and bleeds, I am going to assume that both warriors have their whirlwind axes, which is like having a level 40 blue item when you're 32, and warrior damage relies almost completely on how strong your weapon is.  They also have abilities like cleave and whirlwind, and rend is something they can add onto each mob just like you can SWP each one.  
---
If you looked at boss fight damage I imagine it would be much closer than the final damage total, but you're a priest, the only AoE you have would be if you grabbed holy nova and started spamming that while your party fought packs.
---
Ya you can 4-5 man it pretty easily if your group knows what its doing.
---
Rule 3
---
Even though we have a rad mount, every lock that gives a shit about PvP should still farm a normal epic mount. Our class mount can be a hindrance in some rare occasions.
---
Just default UI frames, enable them in Interface&gt;Raid Profiles
---
The point is everyone around you thinks you targeted them, because everyone reads "you" and think it means them.
---
Tanks have held aggro with a 1h+shield for fifteen years. Sure, you can generate more with a 2hander or dual-wielding, but let's not act like it's a necessity.
---
If you‚Äôre already in the party as a healer I say go for it. It should be clear why you would need that.
---
The only grey area I see is when you join to tank or dps. You are still justified in needing on healer gear but you might catch the group unawares if you do from this position. All you really need to do is make your intentions clear from the start, allow them the chance to leave if it‚Äôs that much of a problem.
---
Do you often cry about PvP on a PvP realm?
---
dude, i get you're salty. but you realize a huge part of the community plays the game to optimize right? 
---
the reason there may be a lack of warriors is you dont get a fucking attack until 36.
---
The quest? I‚Äôve done it. The mount? Yeah the mana cost breaks 5 second rule which is dumb but it‚Äôs too cool to pass up :P
---
dps can do the dungeon when they are 3 levels below the highest level boss.  this will prevent you from body pulling random trash.  as well as increase your chances of actually hitting the boss.
---
tanks should do the dungeon when they are 1 level lower than the highest level boss.  this is just to give you a better chance of actually hitting the boss to make/hold threat.
---
this is my rule of thumb for any dungeon.  yes you can get in sooner but my guideline prevents silly wipes when "that guy" aggros the random pat and the healer is already oom.  it also keeps the group moving through the dungeon at a quick pace since dps will kill trash quickly and the healers will not burn through as much mana per pull.

---
&gt;I love how this meme-level debate could be entirely avoided if only people would write the full name.
---
I type "Deadmines" to avoid the trolls - but sometimes they come in with "I think you mean Cookie's Cove". Not as annoying as the DM / VC argument, but still fucking annoying to get trolled EVERY time I look for a group on a new alt.
---
How safe is priest soloing like that? As a hunter, if I get an add, I start dumping more DPS into the primary mob, then once it drops, my pet keeps the other mob's attention while I run. Usually you get far enough away that the pet despawns and you can whistle them back easily. Otherwise you just need to give them some food to cheer them up after you rez them. It makes Hunter soloing pretty safe, even if you can't move and do any actions at the same time.
---
What would a Priest's exit strategy be for that sort of situation?
---
You can go into zerker stance, us Berserker Rage, then switch to battle stance, charge in and then switch to defensive stance all without risking your health, and the extra rage generation on the first few hits taken adds up to a lot of potential threat.
---
You prove it can be done with the math then call it bullshit
---
I think he means people don‚Äôt know you have to grab a pike to even start the event.

Just saying. sorta proving my point huh?

If it's against a warlock if you kill em it's a win since they are a very arguably the best 1v1 class

---
Well I mean in that case wouldn't the healer have taken aggro if the DPS didn't take it? I'd prefer taking aggro as a mage than the healer ending up with it TBH.
---
I'm pretty sure with each of my kids I didnt play any pc/ps4 games for the first 4 months.  Mostly just played cell phone games.  I couldn't imagine trying to hold a baby and try to sit in a computer chair and play a game.  I did try to play games while holding them when they got a bit older but then it becomes a constant battle to keep them from grabbing everything in reach and pounding on the keyboard/yanking off my glasses etc lol

I found that rotgrip is easily killable if u use levitate and kite him from one end to the other,

The problem is his stacking bleed effect when he catches up to you, easily solved by using stoneskin if you‚Äôre a dwarf üòÉ
---
Get out of my head
---
I frequently play paladin using only my mouse as I read a book. 
---
I have a shift button bound to my mouse so I can use my full action bar while also having strafes and several other abilities bound. 
---
For combat I just use the self heal seal and read
---
I just skipped STV. Grom'gol makes it too dangerous to bother. I ran SM about 30 times instead of questing in STV.
---
UBRS was revamped in WoD.
---
It's cool, but it can't show your position on the map.
---
Where do you level 40-44?
---
The neck from the Kill on sight quests in BRD is pretty good
---
The firestone isn't very useful to be honest. I stick with a staff (preferably with +shadow damage) until I get the Orb of Dar'orahil, then I switch to a +shadow damage dagger and the orb in my offhand.
---
I was referencing the "argument" that was happening on this subreddit like 2 weeks ago with regards to raid targeting.  There was a bunch of "PSAs" which everyone then gave their own "PSAs"
---
Yeah, I'm thinking that I need a mouse upgrade, which will make whatever class I'm playing easier.
---
you can't know that as many people who hit 60 are leveling alts atm.
---
In that case just get the add-on to show player level in chat
---
Undead rogues f*ck you!!
---
Guess you found out that I was right, or else you would've responded to my reply.  At least you know that you're wrong.  Now fix it! :)
---
They sure can and boy howdy are they rare.
---
Unless you generally have next level luck, I think your time is better spent farming gold to buy a green with shadow wrath suffix.
---
There's def no criteria in classic. But if you have a priest who lets say heals for 60k, but is 50% overhealing, as a guild master, class leader, or even a partner healer needs to work with them to help them out. I've done it before and people generally are so much happier when they still have good performances and aren't running out of mana. I'm a shadow priest now, and I used to gauge if the swap was worth losing a priest. You can 100% utilize meters as a positive tool. Especially with new players which there are a lot of. Using them to be toxic is one thing, but using them for intended purposes is good.
---
Post on realm forums, not here
---
take my upvote, you dirty mage!
---
What free mount r u referring to?
---
As someone who sticks with Horde (have never rolled an ally toon) I am extremely jealous of Iron Forge because of how cool it looks and the location. So awesome
---
That would be a 180 bud.
---
Hurricane actually took the sewer entrance last time, not one Horde bothered us. It was time to kick down the front door.
---
&gt; Please do not call Deadmines VC, it's not called that
---
It was abbreviated as VC in the official strategy guide that came out in like 2005. Go search "VC runs" on youtube and you'll find tons of Deadmines videos from 2005-06. It was always VC.
---
Yeah I have never seen this situation you're describing happen. Not once. And I've run a *shit load* of dungeons.
---
&gt;  These are things actively making the game worse. Disappointing.
---
The only disappointing thing about this is you. These have existed since the game launched.
---
combat rogue with core hound tooth that has never once in their entire life used feint gets zero shit for constantly pull aggro meanwhile I don't know a dungeon and didn't range pull once = I get bitched at.
---
I'll go ahead and be self-serving and say Warlock. Why? We need more warlocks. I am tired of joining a group for a dungeon and then having to travel to the other side of the other continent, via flight paths and slow mounts, taking half the day to get there, when I could have had a Warlock do the traveling for me and then just beam me over.
---
The fact you rolled on a item, they told you to roll on, and then you won, but it went to an officer, is enough of a reason to quit to me.  It's shady. Ubrs isn't even a raid, and can be ran multiple times.
---
Cool! My third character from the starting registration was a warrior so maybe I will save it for that!!
---
*facepalm*
---
clearly it does since you see him despawn so quickly. nefarian is the one hitting him, and nef leaves the room during the fight.
---
if hes summoned correctly he will hang around a while, and will even help you clean up the next pull if you bring them into the room.
---
There are dozens of other servers besides Nostalrius. You obviously didn't play them. But you have a good point the pathing on Nostalrius was excellent and an exception to the rule.
---
What's a rouge?
---
If a mage isn't using their entire power pool, they're probably doing things wrong... A mage *should* drink after almost every fight. Also, those spells are not really "cooldowns" -- CoC is 8 sec, Frost Nova is 25 sec and we have cold snap if things get tricky.
---
And if your healer is at 80% mana then... I hate to break it to you... but that's a tanking problem. Pull more, pull faster.
---
Granted, if I'm misinterpreting you and its mages telling the group to *stop* so they can drink, then they're shit and need to learn to manage their mana better.
---
I can run through SM Cath with literally zero breaks between pulls (ninja drinks!). We were getting to the door in less than 10 minutes every single time, finishing up around 20min. And no, this isn't an AOE cleave group or whatever the meta is. Just a warrior, priest, mage combo with two PUG dps.
---
I think there is a lack of tanks for the same reason vanilla had such few tanks and pretty much all of WoW has had a tank problem.
---
Tanking can extremely suck and it‚Äôs hard to get a raid spot.
---
I don't think he said there's a lack of warriors. It's the tanks that are lacking.
---
right click &gt; unlock
---
I'm not sure what you're talking about, greens do roll with shadow wrath.
---
pservers solved this problem long ago.  If one faction has too many logged on, there is a queue for only them.
---
That would be very impractical to farm. You basically have to run the instance from one of the normal entrances to the area just before the waterfall for each attempt. There's probably no way to know if the rare is up before you're basically to him, and most groups probably want to go on from there and finish princess.
---
 You can run the dungeon a few times to try for your drop but it's a very low chance. You'll probably only be able to easily farm that item once you're level 60 and can solo it.
---
Yeah I agree focus should be added because of that but I‚Äôm sure a buncha people would also complain lol
---
Its vc you retail scrub
---
Bro. I hate to be that guy, but I keep seeing you phrase it this way. The pattern is not that rare lol. It's like 50g at the MOST, but more like 30g or so. I can assure you this has been dropped on your server multiple times. It is fairly common as far as "rare drops" go, and it's just a cosmetic shirt that sells for 2-4g depending on the server. Stop psyching yourself out here. Wait a day or 2 for someone to list a different one and get a price point. It's not like you dropped Edgemasters and you're worried about selling them for 100g less than they're worth
---
Heals crit.
---
Many healer trees even have talents that increase your chance to crit.
---
I'm pretty sure a raid of only druids has cleared mc
---
In most of my pug groups the tank waits until the healer is full mana and then a bonus 30 seconds for good measure before pulling, which is why I don't really pug dungeons anymore.
---
To my understanding, they get their warlock mount free? It's a quest chain? I could be wrong.
---
Vanilla did, Battlegroups were introduced in patch 1.12 and allowed you to be matched with players from other servers in the group.
---
'overlords' lol wtf is this? LOTR?
---
Dude I was replying to never said anything about someone 10+ levels ganking you. He said "World PvP isn't risky without the honor system." I said, you still risk your pride with wPvP. Obviously that doesn't apply to higher level ganking because 10+ levels doesn't have any consequences even after the honor system is introduced.

Blizzard already approved ClassicLFG after the author made changes. It'll be here for every phase of Classic.
---
How comes?
---
in Molten Core, mage classes should avoid using fire damage spells
---
I'm amazed that you got all of those power stones, because the drop rate is so bad and you have to split the loot with 5 other people all on the same quest.
---

---
Redundant energy bar right there
---
You face JARAXXUS!!!!!
---
Yeah I just like the space it fills up
---
The ~~problem~~ best part is it makes people nerdrage
---
In any pvp situation where you aren't getting jumped you'll know in advance if it's needed though. And yes it's absolutely worth giving up an offhand if the alternative is sitting in CC waiting to get opened on or eat a pyroblast to the face.
---
I agree with you for the most part but i think marking targets is helpful. Like someone has previously said as a tank youre changing targets alot to keep threat and some times before i notice the tank has changed targets i accidentally pull aggro. It might but over kill but i like marking because it keeps the dps focused and the tank knows which mob to hit a lil more or throw out a taunt. But of course there will always be those ppl that dont care and do their own thing.
---
I figure I'm doing well if I only die 3 times on the way to MC.
---
You leave combat long before the fear ends iirc. But I suspect you still won't be able to accept until you gain control of your character.
---
That's why I never play Xbox anymore because I did a 360 and ran away from it for life.
---
I mean people 3 manned Onyxia. Anything is possible with gear.
---
I don't think I ever had a fair fight in wpvp. The attacker is always higher level or has friends.
---
Yeah OP you should unbind your Q &amp; E and use A &amp; D to strafe instead.
---
Regarding target dummies. It's always dropped from them before but apparently is bugged right now and you can't loot them. Has been since launch.
---
The gnomer mace is treated like a consumable for boss fights for feral, not as their main weapon.  Equip it during a fight to use its proc, then back to your normal weapon.
---
People have been saying this about everything, and they've been wrong about them all. 15 year old feelings don't tend to be that accurate.
---
tbf, it's very inconsistent what you can and can't purge pve wise.
---
Depends entirely on the type of guild you want to raid with. If you're in a pretty serious guild, you will have to respec for maximum efficiency. The resto tree has so many solid talents, you'd miss out on more than most guilds will want. As someone else said, the more optimized you are, the better it is for the raid, allowing more dps, or simply ensuring that longer fights will go smoother since you'll have less mana issues. If you're in a more casual guild though, it's possible, just make sure you check with the raid leader and make sure that the guild is ok with you raiding like that. There will be raids with all kinds of specs i'm sure, but a guild with even a small amount of min maxing will expect every raider to at least be in optimal spec. Play how you want, just make sure to surround yourself with people that have the same mindset and you'll be all good!
---
i regret buying 60% on my druid, barely use it. Should have saved to 70g instead.
---
Well, if you‚Äôre worried about optimization, your Pally will never tank lategame. If you just wanna play and have fun, and manage to find a group of similar minded people, I have no doubt you could clear all content on the Paladin. If you wanna try retribution or holy for late game, those are options. I have absolutely loved playing my holy Paladin.
---
I‚Äôve never played a pally, but I‚Äôm pretty sure it would be smoother to level as Ret? And a lot of classes uses different specs for leveling compared to endgame. 
---
Also - should you delete the pally and go mage? Why would you delete it? Switch focus to the mage if you want to, that‚Äôs just preference, but you don‚Äôt need to delete anything.
---
I know the whole "red equals dead" mentality but from a game theoretical standpoint, cooperation usually beats out adversarial competition. Mindless PvP engagement often results in wasted time / corpse runs for all parties involved. But if that's your thing, go for it.
---
you mean you kicked him so he couldn't roll
---
Because it's nice being able to clear MC in less than an hour. Realistically you wouldn't even want to go out of your way to get these buffs *unless* you were already in a good guild, as one wipe means you lose them all.
---
I just have it there for a quick look, fair enough on the dps meter
---
Had some people pull aggro in P3 with juicy executes, another she immediately knocked him back and turned and killed our healers, another he got feared between tremors and turned into the raid right as a breath went off.
---
But yeah, it gave us more pulls to test it.
---
I personally would move my character on to tbc, but nothing has been confirmed in the least bit
---
&gt; I‚Äôve always been a ‚Äúdps on boss is what matters‚Äù kinda person
---
I feel this in my bones. Us rogues can kinda compete with mage AoE, but only when our 2 minute cooldown comes up. But a lone boss, HO MAMA, does it feel good to shred
---
You know there's this thing called
---
A E S T H E T I C
---
Booty Bay is still bugged, there's still no keyring.. they're not really even trying with this.
---
Abosolutly, meters are just a tool. They are useful tools at that. I have just found that people use them to be shitty to other people. We use meters like you said. They are great for identifying problem areas. We just have no tolerance for shitty people. We will take a no gear nice guy over a decked out sweaty tryhard meta assclown anyday of the week. The dps meter ban has also had the effect of a lot less dps are pulling  off the tanks. We have no problem clearing content and our raids are chill as fuck. I wish we did this in vanilla.
---
To be fair, warriors lose to everyone in PvP, and except for maybe shadow priests, frost mages are the best counter to warriors.
---
yeh , that's what i don't want to happen.
---
I think it's just old gatekeeping tanks vs new tanks who don't know the content.
---
everyone wants a tank who has tanked the dungeon before but no one wants to teach a new tank how to do it since they are not speedrunning the dungeon and may wipe once or twice.
---
theres no tanks because warriors suck for pvp. 
---
go on a pve server and you'll find a lot more
---
I move using my two mouse buttons so don‚Äôt need strafe
---
I'm not. I kite him around the pillar, which usually works, but sometimes he bugs out and does weird things. Not surprising, considering how glitchy his pathing gets in that area. Last night he decided he had enough and went straight through the pillar.
---
My daughter has actually been pretty easy. I don't use a computer chair though. I have a really deep arm chair in front of my desk which I sit at and the arm is big enough to put the mouse on. (The reason I can't use the keyboard is because it's just too far away, and while I could put it on a tray on the chair, the baby takes up that space.) I then have a pillow wrapped in a 4 yard long bolt of t-shirt cloth that is tied end to end and looped behind my shoulders creating a sort of cradle in my lap which allows me to rest her and my arm against the pillow.
---
The only hard part is getting out of the chair when it's time to get some more milk or change her diaper. (I have to take the pillow cradle off over my head put it to the side, move the baby into a good position on my shoulder then get up really carefully.)
---
Most of the time I watch videos while taking care of her, but WoW as a hunter is pretty chill to do while taking care of the baby. Set up, sic the pet, auto attack, then spend a minute cooing at the baby and tickling her feet. Then look up at the screen to make sure an add didn't come along and kill me while I was playing with the baby.
---
Im a tank and was pre raid bis in 2 days because I got every item funneled into me. After that I also made dungeons helping guildmates and friends (why should I farm with random groups) this compared with the fact that you have 1-2 tanks out of 40 in a raid and the fact that tanking sucks sometimes and that you can‚Äôt play solo content are the reasons why there is a tank shortage for dungeons
---
This is by far the coolest one! Everyone needs to do it at least once
---
it was VC on Azgalor too
---
Multiple resets since release, and probably multiple attempts in case of a wipe.
---
Not sure what unbinding Q and E would have to do with that.
---
Lol what? I‚Äôve flipped so many Greens ‚Äúof Shadowy Wrath‚Äù I was able to get my epic mount last night :)
---
Sounds gay.
---
Weird. Probably depends on how you rest your hand on your keyboard, and the keyboards layout. My thumb rests on spacebar but XCV are so easily in reach with it that those keybinds works great for me. Different strokes...
---
Sounds like I should try Paladin then.
---
This is why Horde are the BADDIES
---
Can confirm it was VC on Doomhammer in vanilla as well
---
I guess this is how this one went down.  
---
Jumped on ship, got lucky. Saw ONE skull level horde (not even flagged). Then you flagged up. Decided to post this on Reddit with this long winded title.  
---
Gotta do better than that, boy.
---
They are asshole!
---
honestly, as a level 44 lock I haven't even bothered learning firestone b/c i'm not spec'd destro.  Like IT\_Xaumby implies, it's probably best to check AH regularly for cheap 'of shadow wrath' gear.  I'm currently using a level 39 spiritchaser staff of shadow wrath, and it's lovely. 'Of the eagle' gear is a good 2nd choice; +stam is important b/c it's both your health and mana pool.
---
The rage is misplaced because an addon like ClassicLFG existed back then too. Addons were harder to get a hold of, Curse existed but it wasn't quite as robust as it is now. And there was more sites out there too (warcraftui being the only other major one right now).
---
But what they don't rage about the Macro system, which is the BFA macro system, and has all kinds of functionality we didn't have back in 2006.
---
I went lock this time around. Really enjoy it I‚Äôm only level 41 but find leveling easy just been messing with all my professions and secondaries so it‚Äôs taking a while. We can aoe farm too just not as good as mages in my book. I went tailoring and herb I‚Äôve been sending all my herbs to my bank to save for my alt to have alch. Gonna switch depending if lock stays my main to chanting more than likely. The bags and all for my alts is helpful too and I plan on leveling a priest so the cheap gear upgrades is also nice. For money you could go skinning heard that‚Äôs still decent. But for pvp hands down after chest piece I‚Äôd go engineering and my gathering from the start would be mining and just save all my ore and stuff and send it to bank alt to level my  engineering.
---
Have you tried playing an actual tank class
---
That is probably why blizz made it so factions can't talk to each other. Makes it easy to hate the opposite faction when you can't talk to them.
---
&gt;if I should delete my pally 
---
Don't, it would be a big waste. You can always make him a profession alt - it's almost 35 and can have 300 profession.
---
&gt;now its somewhat troublesome to hold aggro in dungeons
---
Warriors and druids have similar issues, don't worry, it's Classic.
---
&gt;I've also heard that some pally characters respec endgame? 
---
Most of the paladins respec to healers and heal throughout endgame. However, if you're not concerned about raids, paladin tanks work too.
---
Mages are indeed better leveler than paladins, but they can't tank :D Weight everything, and good luck in this difficult choice.
---
Luckily as a priest healer the DM trinket is massively better than Briarwood. It's slightly less healing but second wind from BRD is a good trinket too, the extra 300 mana per fight amounts to about 1k more healing.
---
  I've given it multiple takes and here's how it goes:  
---
Tank pulls group
---
Each individual DPS then targets a different mob
---
Heal every single party member because they are all tanking
---
Get bitched at because I need to drink or just pull the next group because fuck my mana.
---
Group wipes.
---
And/or
---
Tank pulls Anger
---
Secondary group comes and instantly aggros to me but everyone is focused on killing Anger for that sweet HOJ drop and could not care less if I die.
---
HOJ either drops and whoever wins it drops group OR HOJ doesn't drop and they want to rinse and repeat, bitching they have to wait for me to run back.
---
Big if true
---
That's the 8 ball saying try again l8r.
---
My friend group is pretty vicious about killing anyone they come across but I‚Äôm usually just doing a /wave and running past.
---
Sometimes the pink mist gets triggered by STV or similar and then there‚Äôs a period of being a prick that follows - never corpse camping or chain killing a lowbie though, that‚Äôs just asshole behaviour.
---
Pick a lower pop server if this is your plan. I'm a 50 mage and have honestly never done any significant aoe farming because the spots for it are always taken.
---
What could you possibly need songflower for in phase one?
---
Tarnished Elven is a lot better than Blackstone.
---
Using Kang the Decapitator in ZF to tank was a real treat, I‚Äôm sad that these days will soon come to an end.
---
hahaha i hope your serious or my guilds gonna hate me later
---
Why rest when you can rise from the grave and enjoy life again?
---
It's a game. We all play it together.

almost anytime I do an escort quest ally come out of the woodworks to make me fail, its all-out war on them PvP servers
---
This is cool. I woulda like to see the helm progression as well though so kinda wish you had headpiece showing. Still cool though :D
---
I hope this is not possible in classic - it has always been debated
---
cant remember where i saw it but they made an announcement that they would be releasing phase to by the end of the year and then a week or so after said they have managed to bring the release of dire maul forward to this reset. if you have been following from the start of the classic announcements back from blizzcon then you will have seen most of what i am saying here
---
Simplest solution possible: just say, "OK," and follow the tank.
---
Nice explanation, I see your point.   It looks like the toothpaste is out of the tube on this one, and it's going to be nearly (if not) impossible to put it back in.
---
Maybe for your next alt?
---
He is using W,A,S,D,Q,&amp;E for abilities.

Level 52 prot warrior tank.  Since lvl 18 only level through instances with a random quest here and there (e.g, Hakkar scroll, ZF mallet).  Mostly pug since I have a small guild.  I have never been flamed or been spoken to rudely. That said, everything else in this thread rings true and I find myself playing one day and taking two off. Good DPS is a joy to play with. They CC on the very rare fight you want it.  They let you LoS pull,  they pay attention to kill order and they watch aggro meter.  I can‚Äôt remember the last time I had a group with more 3. good DPS.  Usually there is a contest between 2 or all 3 of them to get top damage. Pulls, face pulls, AoE right after I charge...
---
Side note, priests, please do not bubble prot warriors unless there is an emergency it kills our ability to get rage.
---
complaining about other people on an MMO....

Interestingly enough the term "yeet" dates back to the biblical ages before the dawn of man or beast, as described in Pescapalian 23:19 -And God looked upon what he had created, the earth and the heavens, and after a moment's rest he stirred and commanded "Yo yeet some fuggin sunshine on them hoes". And it was done.

Can't switch back because that removes the buff, so you are using that weapon of you want the strongest white damage and maul damage booster in the game.
---
There‚Äôs a cool video of GMs summoning huge bosses to that location and murderfacing everyone in range.
---
Yeah they'll stay inside and you'll lose aggro
---
The man's right.
---
We didn't run like bitches. We stayed and defended our homes and even getting killed was just a minor setback.
---
Earth and air elementals in the northwest corner of silithus also give hydraxian rep, fyi. You don‚Äôt strictly need to go into MC to get enough rep for an aqual quintessence.
---
I did, it actually works.
---
You should be able to
---
I'm the warlock in question.  Fuck Deathmage and fuck his guild too.  Want the full story, ask me.
---
it was in vanilla back in the day so i immagine it will be in classic
---
We‚Äôre not surprised, you‚Äôre an alliance player. Vengeful, hateful alliance with their creepy little gnomes and such.
---
Your missing out on shadowform.....
---
&gt; The VC vs DM discussion is something i only read on reddit and never actually saw ingame
---
You are lucky.
---
Just what I was looking for
---
Yeah, that is what I will probably end up doing. might make a macro so it casts when I arcane shot. would like it to be automatic though
---
Haha
---
damn I dont understand why the shadow or frozen versions wouldnt be on wowhead though
---
Please ignore the people telling you that you won‚Äôt be effective as enhancement. If you are mainly after PvP, you can find a guild that will take you raiding for melee group totem twisting, as an off-healer/raid healer or because they are just filling out (MC is being done with 20 people in 80% blues these days, YouTube it).
---
As for PvP, elemental is so easy to CC and drop it‚Äôs really not as amazing as everyone claims. You will be able to burst down anyone you get the jump on but you can probably do about as well as enhancement if you have the element of surprise. In BGs you‚Äôll just need to be a hybrid player (as enh or ele). Your goal is to be rogue like, pick your engagements and do your best to support your team around you. You are not as beef as a warrior, you are not as 1 shot as the infamous unbreakable, but you will bring value to your team if you learn to support them properly. 
---
So what does that mean for you? Your priority should be to support the dps around you and frost shock/keep your healers alive with off-heals. If you are with a Warrior or Rogue, drop WF totem, switch to grounding for the sheeps/big spells and re-drop WF, keep an earthbind down on the kill target, break fear with tremor, ES on cooldown to stop heals or do damage and be sure to support heal - if they die, you won‚Äôt be far behind. If you are with a ranged dps or healer, you focus on keeping people off them so they can do real damage (or heal freely), ES enemy heals and apply pressure where you can. You are not the top meta class in Classic but you bring a lot to your group as any spec and a good shaman can turn the tide of most battles. What is your purpose? You provide utility to your group. Don‚Äôt focus on anything else. Ele or enh or resto, learn to bring utility while keeping up pressure. Group fights are won be the team that can best keep up the pressure on the other side - you can both reduce pressure on your side and apply it to the enemy.
---
There is a real argument to be made about Ele for instakilling flag carriers in WSG but a PoM mage will always be better at that than you are and your job, if you go with them on the hunt for the FC, will be to support them anyway. You can also do this as enhancement and sometimes you can do a better job locking down a healer so that a rogue and Pom mage can drop the FC. Here‚Äôs an example: typical 5 man type turtle (feral Druid/sword and board war with 2 heals and 1 or 2 DPS support) and 3-4 man type assassination group (1 or 2 mages/locks + rogue/war + you). You start by dropping WF totem, purging the FC completely, you rotate tremor and earthbind so their team‚Äôs movement is locked down, watch for a fear/sheep to grounding totem and focus the flag carrier to help with the pressure and then when CC breaks on a healer you turn to them and start pressuring them. They will either get completely locked down by your shocks and lose their defensives to your totems or die to your WFs or have to stop healing FC to heal themselves because of your dps on them. You also drop clutch heals on your team because no one will be worrying about you since you‚Äôre on their healer and not on the FC. In the meantime, your assassination team is pumping full dps into the FC and hopefully 1 healer stays CC‚Äôd in sheep/fear. This is a strong play to break a turtle‚Äôs shell. Are there other ways to do this with Ele? Of course. But does that make enhancement gimp? Of course not.
---
We can theorycraft this to death, but enhancement is not a gimp spec without hand of rag - people that think that just don‚Äôt know the class well enough or know how to play with a team. If you want to be a 1 man army, go with a different meta. But if you want to make a 3 man army into a squad capable of dropping 4-5 people then stay shaman, pick a spec you wanna learn, learn it, play it.

Piggy backing that Prot warriors dispel magic effects with shield slam, so it should fall off quickly.
---
The way we always did it back in the day was have multiple tanks all fight for aggro when she lands and run her into position.  Then whoever has aggro just holds it at the other tanks back off
---
Ya I‚Äôm switching servers
---
Ah fair enough.  
---
Also, not sure why I was downvoted for asking lol
---
So perhaps you should change the title to unverified speculation instead of confirmed. Because, to everyone not you, those are wildly different phrases and meanings.
---
Looks safe
---
I'm 100% with you, there are the people that use them to want to brag, those tend to be the players that do terrible and will hurt come bwl and beyond. I'd rather take 20 brand new players and teach them properly then 20 knowitalls.
---
At level 60, you have 300 weapon skill when maxed. A boss (which are coded as level 63 by the game) will have 315 defense. Getting +5 skill puts you at 305, which does something to the effect of giving you an extra 3% chance to hit and reduces the damage penalty of glancing blows (hits that do less damage; you have a lot of them against an enemy 3 levels higher than you). For orcs (+5 axes) and humans (+5 maces and swords), these aren't that great. But for warriors and shaman of all other races, they're the best gloves you can get for raiding.
---
Yesterday I was in Un'Goro and after waiting about 10min, I finally started the Rizzo escort quest, the goblin you lead from a cave in Fireplume to Marshal's Camp. I was ALMOST to the camp when a 60 orc rogue, dismounts and kills me, having me fail the quest. 
---
I... will never give mercy to the Horde and will get my vengeance by ruining every horde escort I come accross.
---
I did. I saw someone looking for a tank for DM, and he told me "lol you're lvl 20" well obviously. "No, dm is dire maul, deadmines is vc" and IT IS NOT
---
Just curious if anyone knows if the warrior prot talent One hand weapon specialization applies to the off-hand if you are dual-wielding?
---
Yep, on purpose... i want to see does someone run and suceed with this build
---
This is not a fair fight.
---
The Alliance should have brought **TWO** raid groups.
---
I‚Äôd do all the quests first. You‚Äôll have to do like 2/3 full runs. They‚Äôre long but worth it thanks to the fat quest exp.
---
Cool, that‚Äôs nice to hear. I really think this is what I‚Äôm going to go with but wanted to hear if anyone would recommend something else
---
killing enemy faction on a pvp server isn't griefing
---
HAHAHA this is awesome. Hilarious!
---
WTF is this private server shit where MC doesn't bring you into combat/aggro?! It was NEVER that way in Vanilla/BC.
---
It *kinda* works. You don't take dmg. But it still explodes
---
&gt;That event is actually really challenging without it. 
---
&gt;It's already extremely easy. 
---
?????
---
Oh for sure, I'm not sure there is anything they can do now, though I do think they should keep transfers open permanently on realms that have tipped past the point of no return.  Not that it will help me, my ally guild is steadfast about staying on Herod.
---
Paladins do fine tanking for 5 man dungeons even end game. Raids are a little different.
---
let's just call it Vines.
---
My guild has one prot warrior, 3 bear tanks, a really good pally trying to make prot work(he basically off tanks on bosses like Sulfuron and Domo to really good success as well as being our aoe pull tank and dispeller in some fights). Our bears are awesome I never run with our main tank warr so like 90% of my dungeon runs at 60 have been with a droid. We haven't even wiped on any bosses in 4 weeks outside of our first rag attempt and we're even letting our bear tank officer main tank Rag now so he can get used to it. My guild has a ton of guys that are meme spec and we love it. We have feral DPS and our only ret pally is a spelladin with a really cool dps build, we're trying to get him hand of rag for the memes.
---
Exactly. Because classic lfg still works
---
I think it's tasteful to have just a small dusting on each cheekbone.  Anything more than that makes you look cheap.
---
I'll be getting that one, but I'm shadow and briarwood is top tier for me. My dumbass sold my 2% crit trink so I have to get that back friday.
---
Priests are usually expected to heal endgame. Shadow priest is good pvp. If you want a caster dps warlock/mage would be best. You‚Äôll be asked to tank when levelling but fury warrior is also viable endgame dps. I just mention them because you originally wanted a ret paladin and they are both plate melee dps.
---
I have evidence of all the screenshots including your rape jokes in guild. We've literally done nothing except ask you not to make those jokes in guild chat. Please post whatever evidence you claim to have :)
---
It's definitely a bug to do with the invis. Best bet is to take it off of auto cast
---
&gt; Main reasoning being that Deadmines comes first in the leveling process
---
No, the main reasoning being that deadmines existed before diremaul existed.

Ôªø**&lt;The King's Guard&gt;**
---
**Server**: Remulos (OCE | PvE) | **Faction**: Alliance
---
Looking for a casual Kiwi guild with friendly, helpful players?
---
**About**
---
The King's Guard is a casual guild for friendly, mature players. We understand that the game is balanced around commitments such as work and family.
---
Guild dungeon runs, helping each other out and hanging out in chat are all activities you can enjoy. 
---
Although we are casual by nature, we will raid and expect to do progression raiding‚Äîthough at a slower pace than many other guilds. 
---
**Expectations**
---
Have a decent attitude towards everyone.
---
Be willing to overlook mistakes and offer to help and support other players wherever you can.
---
This is about community and friendship.
---
**Timezone**
---
Most players are on during peak Oceanic times. Raiding will be weekends, 8-10pm server time.
---
**Loot rules**
---
We are going with Suicide Kings. Loot drama should never be an issue with mature, friendly players.
---
**Apply**
---
If you're an Oceanic player looking for a great home, come check us out: https://discord.gg/wc6Eye3
---
Peace.
---
There‚Äôs a fast forward arrow at the top
---
Jesus christ lol. True though
---
I feel your pain friend but as a resto Druid.
---
Yeah.  But you learn when you can slack off.  Once you do a dungeon a few times and know the way and how to pull all the packs, you don't have to think about that.
---
Then you just charge in, hit all the mobs with sunder twice, and afk til pack is dead and everyone is done drinking.
---
And which ones takes hours or rep to farm now?
---
We have someone named "shirt".
---
You can still do that, but then it‚Äôs always a question of how many people will die first and will she breathe on the raid. 
---
My strategy puts her on the OT every time in P3.
---
Can you get into hyjal still?
---
&lt;Tribute&gt;
---
Horde | Whitemane (PvP-PST) | Wed/Thu 8pm-11:30pm PST | Semi-hardcore | Loot council
---
This isn't the greatest guild in the world, no. This is just a &lt;Tribute&gt;. Ohhh, whoah, ah-whoah-oh! :)
---
Our main goal for &lt;Tribute&gt; is to foster a fun gaming community of like-minded and social players who put the needs and success of the team above their own. Our raids are relaxed, but focused - we get shit done. We prioritize loot and invites with the goal of gearing up efficiently, clearing content swiftly, and no drama. We're all adults here and many of us have families and/or demanding careers, so we want to be strategic in getting the most out of our game time. We think having fun with friends is critical to the overall success of the guild, and host "Game Nights" once every 4-6 weeks or so; Game Night normally includes some form of intoxication and free online games like Cards Against Humanity, Jackbox Games, etc.
---
Expectations
---
We'll expect you to bring your best, strive to be knowledgeable about your class, never be afraid to ask questions, accept and give feedback graciously, improve the experience of the team, and be social &amp; have fun. If you like our philosophy and want to be part of our team, then read on. Even if you aren't interested in raiding, social members that fit with our culture are always welcome to join and hang out, level, PvP, and/or farm with us.
---
Raid schedule
---
Our regular raid times are Wednesday and Thursday from 8:00pm-11:30pm PST (ends earlier on farm nights). This means we start pulling at 8:00pm so you'll need to be online, at the instance, with consumes, ready to go by 7:45pm. We will have other guild events such as group farming , PvP, 20-mans, old 40-man content, and/or GDKP runs on Saturdays. Our loot system is described in more detail on our discord.
---
Interested?
---
Please join our discord at https://discord.gg/yZfrb8S, read things, and chat with us!
---
Thanks everyone for the replies and confirmation.  upvotes all around.
---
\+4 to chest is the unicorn on my server too.
---
Wow. They probably should've coded that a bit differently haha
---
Leading is very much part of the design of Tanking. That is expected, and if you don't like doing the occasional tard-wrangling, you probably don't like much else besides the loot priority and the fast queue times. You have to put in the effort to manage expectations and to get people on the same page as you. The best time to do this is before starting to clear the instance IMO.
---
I'll set expectations prior to a run, let them know about what I plan to do in the instance and how I tank (because tanks vary WIDELY in style), and usually I'll even say we will start slow and see how we function before we start pulling more than 1 pack at a time. Get the dialogue going before running the instance and it is usually more than fine.
---
I've had 1 legitimately bad experience in a pug. We were in the Grim Guzzler, and were discussing which quests to do first, when the Rogue interjected with "Can we kill this guy real quick?" (The gnome on the upper floor). I said "Wait, we can give this guy booze, right?" My party was responding when all of the sudden, right after I bought drinks, prior to Thunderbrew and Ribbly's Head, he start attacking. We bail him out, do Thunderbrew and Ribbly, then wipe at Phalanx because the Fireguard came in, and the Hammered Patrons were stacked next to the door, who were now red. It quite literally ruined the run, especially since I was underleveled for the instance at the time. Missed the Chest of the Seven because of that.
---
So, while scenarios like that exists and do certainly happen, most people are chill because at least they are attempting the content, and clearing slowly or having messy pulls is a bunch better than watching YouTube while hitting your LFG macro in 3 different channels.
---
There's also a waterfall on the western side of feralas that you can actually swim up. Physics man.
---
Such a stupid thread you decided to make
---
Nah.
---
As a Zandalari Tribe player, red is dead (unless they are low level)
---
Jadefire run or bust
---
Gather as much as you can, drop consecrate, bubble. When bubble is running out then the dps can drop their AoE
---
I think this is the first time I've personally seen a post from my server on the front page lol
---
Worked on private servers to clear the effect but guessing it doesn‚Äôt work in classic.
---
How much hit do you need for arms?
---
I would suggest doing dungeons from 52-60 rather than quests. It's slower to level that way, but you'll naturally earn some of your pre-raid BiS gear and also when you hit 60 all of the high level zone quests will still be avaliable. The quests give more gold at 60 than they do at pre-60, so you can easily make 500g in a day of questing if all of the quests from zones like Seering Gorge etc are available. 
---
This assumes you're not in a rush to get to 60.
---
Dire Maul did not exist at launch, so no.
---
Does anyone know the fastest way to get back to the entrance where you use scepter after the run to keep doing farm runs?
---
Our main offtank in vanilla was a Druid.  It's not a meme like say Boomkin or a Ret Paladin is.  If he thinks that, he's an idiot.  Is a Warrior tank better assuming equal gear and skill?  Yes... but that doesn't mean that Druid tanks are bad.  In fact, the streamer Staysafe got server first Rag on Faerlina with a Druid MT.  Your GM obviously didn't raid much back in Vanilla.
---
Just considering how much your life must suck is making my life that little bit suckier rn. That is the definition of "sucks to be you"!
---
Ah. I think I actually only ever had two helms!
---
Whitemane Chapeau (which I hid because I don‚Äôt like the look of it), and Green Lens of Shadow Power (which is pre-raid bis for me). The lens I actually did have showing but it‚Äôs not very easy to see. It‚Äôs from around Hinterlands onwards :)
---
That's the thing with Classic. No fancy pants shiny armor and epic glowy weapon, just good old random stuff you found on the ground and love every piece of it.
---
Lol I did SM yesterday with a party on my 51 hunter to try to get the tabard. I pulled Herod while everyone was still in the hallway and all those elites ran into the chamber. After 2 minutes of running up and down kiting we managed to clear them all barely. Only 2 of us died. Those 4 or 5 elites added an unexpectedly intense moment to our run!
---
Any WHU alumni want to get the band back together? I am on Old Blanchy, as are 2 others I know of. 
---
All loot is Hunter Loot.
---
I understand the philosophy. However, there's no "vote kick" system in Classic.
---
\+1 giving someone the benefit of the doubt.
---
one hand weapon spec means you have a single weapon in your main hand.
---
I **easily** have spent more time in STV than any other zone in the game so far. I feel hardened from the experience.
---
The plugin records everyone your character sees.
---
On my server, I've been campaigning for Deadmines to be Baby DM and Dire Maul to be Daddy DM.
---
Which funny enough is a perfectly reasonable explanation for why there was an escort quest leading you to the entrance before you get the VC quest especially before the meeting stones went up.
---
It's more fun to go hard. You don't need good gear or buffs to do MC/Ony, but it's more fun to go in hard.
---
Im so sad they killed Pyroblast/PoM combo. It was so fun to play but incredibly stupid to play against.
---
His name checks out.
---
I'm interested, I'm Horde on Incendius as well, would like to know what's up
---
"my instances" lol
---
these classic faceroll dungeons are serious business amiright. I don't know who i'd made it through a run without completely min/maxing.
---
chill dude
---
Why‚Äôd you get the impression they‚Äôre keyboard turning? I do the same thing with the mouse.
---
do you buy the beers and save them for the next time you run it?
---
This is why you clear the rooms he's not in FIRST, and CC if you can. You can bubble out of the fear as a paladin.
---
If only all horde did this, but more often than not the ?? Will kill me while im busy with mobs, then camp me while dancing on my corpse lile they won something
---
I went herb enchanter. I find the best herbs are things like, blindweed, dreamfoil, sun grass, mountain silver sage, and wildvine. Haven‚Äôt found any black lotus yet I‚Äôm only 55.

Nothing but good choices, so you can just pick for looks.
---
Layer reduction
---
that is just raw data, if an area has \~20 nodes and no one is ever there, that would be better than a place with \~50 nodes that is a common quest area/know spot etc,  but i'll add if you want iron dont forget to check caves as a lot of higher level players who may be farming want to stay on their mounts.
---
It's pretty standard to mark casters as skull. They die fast and don't meele hard. If someone pulls aggro it's no big deal.
---
I don't have evidence to support this, but it feels like Blizzard lowered the number of people allowed on the server to artificially create a queue.
---
Makes it seem like there is still a load of people playing despite recent controversy + people who have gradually stopped playing after trying classic out
---
You ever wipe in a dungeon? Maybe a dps pulled too much or healer died to something... Man I bet a battle rez or bubble/lay on hands would be nice.
---
Play a similar during leveling, but with wand, spirit tap and two in heal... Works quite well so far.. Good at farm, ok for dungeon heal, ok for pvp.. Will stick to it till 60 i believe üòâüòÖ
---
For all dungeons with a mage. Healers should stop healing when the enemy is almost dead and drink immediately...don't top me off...I have free food and I'll be standing around waiting regardless.
---
If I'm getting aggro almost everytime as the healer, it is NOT fun for me. Like the AOE mages following internet trends, Tanks think all they need to do is wear a 2-hander and they're doing their job.
---
Sounds like someone was out dps'd by a moonkin and never got over it.
---
I saw some priests try to duel people of same faction while aboard ship, can you guess why?
---
yes, guitar
---
Ungoro Felwood winter spring and plaguelands
---
Ungoro crater is a good spot especially if you have skinning or herbs as professions
---
Probs like 200 lol
---
Right lol I recognized those guild names instantly.
---
The new shadow oil/spell damage spelladin meta seems really promising, and afaik, not many people are even trying it yet.  Hand of Rag's proc is boosted by spell damage making it more than just memeworthy on a pally  (though MCP is actually better when the buff is kept up, from what I've read).
---
Well, the reed is for the healer, the main and or the Felstriker is reserved for either/or tank/fury/rogue, same for trueshot, so at minimum thats two different people.
---
A fair amount don‚Äôt know this either. 
---
Healers: If your tank pulled while your drinking, you don‚Äôt have to stop drinking to heal him right away. Unless you know they‚Äôre going to die, you don‚Äôt need to top them off right away. If you started drinking, you can drink during combat.
---
Is it even worthwhile to be a druid dps? tank/healing and especially healing seems the only viable ms/os combo. Not trying to min-max but when it comes to gear and viability those two specs seem the only rout. 
---
Are there druid dps talent distributions where you can ot, spot heal, and dps?
---
The lack of robes around the 40-ish (?) levels is frightening, gonna take a load of Deviate Savory Delight to hide those bermudas...
---
It‚Äôs BiS for lvl 19 though!!!!
---
Shadowpriest vs warrior is so sad üò≠
---
No idea what you mean by sectioning. My first thought is along the lines of something a serial killer would do to dispose of a body, and that sounds fitting enough for me.
---
It's kind of funny how now people pre potting with shadow protection really good turns the tide on loatheb.
---
And there's no enchant to be gotten at the moment.
---
Keep checking the neutral auction house on your server, pets are one of the most common things in the goblin auction houses.
---
the most impressive thing for me was the ZF scene where the mage instantly pulls the mob off the healer with CS
---
feelsgoodman
---
I bought into retail like two months before classic came out and almost had a fit the first time the tank pulled half the room and people just spammed everything. But that's how it it, you can full on rush instances with no real risk, and people kick you if you take things carefully. When classic first came out there were so many wipes in the first few rooms of DM cause people assumed that's how it was.
---
On the right side you can see traces of a tauren male covering for his children
---
Weakauras was installed a long time ago. But I never use it as it's complexity. I will find a day to overcome it XD. Thanks for your advise!
---
Anybody believe these titles? :D Nice steal, just drop the title
---
On your pet bar right click the ability I think that sets it to either cast or cool down or not. If it‚Äôs highlighted it will continue to cast on cool down
---
Same thing with Ravenguard as well. Constantly trying to absorb guilds yet no one ever groups up and helps out guildies. Got the hell out of there
---
Honestly, successfully pulling off a slam rotation is far more satisfying than anything arms has to offer.
---
It has to do with how easy it is to cripple yourself and how rewarding the dps of a flawless rotation is.
---
He'll follow you out. But you have to start running before he actually appears. The guys i ran with knew the cue from something the boss yelled. Idk the details.
---
I made a rape joke and was punished.  Afterwards my brother went a tirade in chat.  I was kicked from the guild because of him.  Fine with all that.  Then all my friends in the guild, who weren't even on at the time, also got kicked.  Since then the GM, Deathmage, and his gf have whispered me and my brother harassing.  During this run, the healer druid, was talking shit to me.  His GM also whispered me to make fun of me once during the run.  Not defending my ninja or my rape joke.  But the GM is far from innocent.
---
In lore, no. Alliance are actually the evil side.
---
In retail, yes.
---
Man did you dislocate your shoulder from reaching so far?
---
Right I know what they said were in the phases.  I have been following.   When was that post made about what was in each phases?    
---
 3/11 waaaay before 8/14 when the post about the keyring was made.
---
And the keyring post was still made before the Ion's comments about Phase 2 by end of year, which was centered around world pvp and outdoor bosses.
---
What else would be in the first "Patch" of classic.   If it was phase 2 they would have said Phase 2 like they have in response to every other question regarding when certain items or quests would be available.
---
The only reason to say "PPM" to something, is when this "something" can apply to anything with different AS. In my cases weapon binded to their own timings. I did not tested them with Flurry (Increased Attack speed), but i guess maybe to try this later.
---
This just reminds me how shitty I felt when I was doing the Tarren Mill quests for the first time a few weeks ago, specifically the one where they have you give that dog Stanley a potion to transform him then kill him...geeze
---
Why do you carry a set of gear when you have to go to the city for a spec change anyway
---
This is gonna get removed for rule 3. Post it on r/Incendius though.

---
I looted two from the lowest rank dummy in 15-20 tries
---
I feel it's more people's, "I've been playing vanilla for the past 15 years on p servers we can go 10.6969 percent faster in this deadlines run. Here let me pull for you." Mentality
---
This is important for players who have not yet collected their Lava Orb.
---
I looted a Fused Wiring from the final boss in Gnomer :D
---
Tremor Totem doesn't work on Mutanus The Devourer's Nightmare ability but Purge does. Last boss of Wailing Caverns.
---
You can also jump the parapets in  Shadowfang Keep to get out fast.
---
If I'm not mistaken, isn't that head gear from the final boss in Gnomeragon?
---
why would you need to stand there for an hour while levelling alchemy?
---
Not for extended aoe, where fury's superior rage generation (30% faster swings thanks to flurry) pulls out ahead.
---
No, but they're perfectly in the right to suggest bigger pulls if they feel we can handle it. Otherwise my focus is just on making sure the dungeon run is completed without deaths and pulling whenever the healer has mana'd up.
---
More accurate to make that an orc or unded
---
I had a fun stocks group with three mages, a priest and a rogue. We just triple aoed down whole rooms.
---
Stalagg chiming in, was 70% horde before server transfers opened up - and the transfer destinations are alliance dominant which means Stalagg is even more skewed now. I can assure you the difference is absolutely not minuscule.
---
So, in the meantime, I should be equipping devilsaur set first and then truestrike after?
---
Just got the 1h mace from Cath.
---
I've never used a 1h mace before. What's the best way to level it up so when I'm tankin/spankin  a dungeonI'm not missing every swing?
---
Just buy a really crappy 1h mace from AH and hit stuff with it?

My group did that but the boss summoned the two stone elites right outside the boss room and wiped us. I'm not sure what we did wrong or if that was patched.
---
What's the line for success or failure? 170k is nothing to sneeze at.
---
The real loser is you for being butthurt over an addon.
---
Western ungoro, the run sucks lol
---
When we did this those two statues outside his room came to life and whomped us.
---
The easiest way I handle this in raids is to set my pet to attack the boss, then immediately hit follow again. He will use howl on CD for the entirety of the fight as he is still "in combat" .
---
Or they gave up on trying to get Strat groups together. I spent three nights in a row trying to run Strat. Only one group made it into the instance and wiped 7 times in two hours while killing 2 bosses total.
---
Getting runs together for pretty much any other instance is going to be a lot easier. So I can see people taking the gear they can actually acquire over theoretical gear they might never even see the boss it drops from.
---
I hope that's a joke, for your sake.
---
We have to wait to see if even Hunter can do it in Classic.
---
I will look into it in the coming days, thanks for making me aware.
---
Hi I'm a druid I tank and I heal with the same spec. Ho boy rip class meme spec. (HotW 0/30/21)
---
I downrank and spam healing touch. I do almost the same healing as paladins or priest.  Ho wait no I do like 5% less than them. Ho boy rip class meme spec.
---
I tank swipe swipe swipe. Big HP pool great threat. Wait I cant use potions in bear form. Ho boy rip class meme spec.
---
Druids have arguably the best single buff in the game. Ho boy rip...class...wait no that's good right?
---
I don't care what. the majority of people think. The people on my server play with me. We have fun. Game is realistically not that hard just time consuming and min maxing only makes sense for hardcore players who try and set records. 
---
Also it takes me literally 2 seconds to find groups because I can either heal or tank.
---
Are you able to sell them for 4.6g profit? It's very rare for reagents to be cheap enough to turn much of a profit on the potions they make.
---
Doesn't seem smart from a purely financial perspective. wait for it to be cheaper or try and get it yourself, unless you have a guild that needs a supply of them.
---
I'm only lvl 39 but ive been making decent gph farming blindweed in SoS. I use it for arcane potions, limited invulnerability potions, and greater intellect potions. Beyond that frost oil is a steady money maker because of the quest in badlands. I've also been stocking up free action potions and swiftness potions to be ready for phase 2/3. Hope this helps. I have about 140 gold at lvl 39 doing this.
---
Conversely, if you hate your group, you can also flare VC's little cabin as a hunter and fight all the adds at once!
---
Are you aware that your guild will not want you to use mortal strike on bosses because of the limited debuffs?
---
Looking for a few players on Ashkandi alliance side for BRD and onwards. Mostly on    9:30EST till whenever.
---
Well first off, rogues can‚Äôt use axes.
---
Second, that‚Äôs the prebis mainhand for orc fury warriors. It‚Äôs selling for about 300g on my server.
---
Literally anything one shots them.
---
Dreamfoil sells for 12g a stack on my server. M silversage is also pretty expensive. You can find a loop for both of these and do well. 
---
Additionally, casters are always looking for stacks of Superior Mana pots if you want to farm up some blindweed.
---
I did a fury prot hybrid (only got 1 rank into 2 shield blocks). Then rest into fury.
---
When you first pull you should always demor roar first the damage mitigation is great. Then use shield block+ revenge until you revenge each target 1-2 times. Then switch to sunder. If someone pulls aggro taunt it before it gets out of your range.
---
I have a macro set up for a 2h weapon and sword+shield. Ill start in defence and sword shield but once there's only 1-2 mobs left ill switch to battle+2h to finish them off. Sometimes I tank with a 2h but only if I'm a high enough level for the dungeon and am not putting too much stress on the healer.
---
Oh sorry I didn‚Äôt mention, I‚Äôm grabbing Holy Nova to aoe farm. Its not meant to be used for healing dungeons at all.
---
Oldest just got rerolled to a priest so they can off heal if I die, thanks for the idea lol
---

So I use one of those 12 button grid mice and like to have my bars reflect that.  I also use a lot of macros so there are shift/alt/ctrl modifiers for most of the buttons.  I also use Weakauras for some reminders and other fun stuff.  Just started messing with Plater and I'm liking it so far.
---
The constructs in reattlegore‚Äôs room have about a 30% drop rate for them too. I got all my skins for breastplate of bloodthirst in a single run just because we totally cleared the room.
---
Took me many more runs of strat to get my Abom stitchings however.
---
Aye, either find somewhere else to go questing or find a lower level zone to continue the cycle of violence against your enemy haha. I‚Äôm finally wrapping up Hillsbrad/Alterac/Arathi quests  and I‚Äôm happy to be out of that crucible. I‚Äôm wondering if I can avoid STV completely but I‚Äôll probably have to go there at some point.
---
Nah I'll hit 60 then quit until the first BGs show up.
---
But let's be honest I won't be 60 until at least P2.
---
The proper terminology is pom-pyro you uncultured swine.
---
wack ass mentality here. a tank is a thankless job. wtf. you're playing the game for people to suck your dick??? people that struggle with tanking and think dpsing is easier definitely are also dogshit at dps too
---
Could you share how you use your /assist macro? Thanks!
---
*Not enough rage*
---
Sword*
---
Yeah, after reading some of the responses now I think I will start to mark mobs and see how it changes things.
---
thanx guys, i will definitely check out Snutz &amp; the others u mentioned, cheers!!! ü§ô
---
In that case you're comparing playing a mage at peak efficiency to a really shit warrior. Not really a fair comparison.
---
So can you turn and look behind you, for example, without moving your character?
---
Chad fire vs Virgin frost
---
1. Re-roll Rogue
---
2. DPS in tier gear
---
3. Be happy
---
From everything I've heard it seems that full Protection Warriors are the best mitigation and dual wield Fury-Prot Warriors are the best threat (and DPS), which puts Feral Druids comfortably in the middle, with threat that blows away full Protection Warriors and mitigation that blows away Fury-Prot.
---
While this means Feral Druids should be able to tank anything (that doesn't have a specific mechanic that messes with Druids) it also means that undergeared raids would probably prefer a full Prot Warrior and overgeared raids would probably prefer a Fury-Prot Warrior.
---
You can also just hold on to the quest gun that explodes then. If you're a class with no ranged items (like Shams/Pallies) you can just keep that gun there for the rest of Classic and blow them up if they get pulled.
---
It should level off soon.  Before we started and MC was still a mystery for the difficulty, people expected that needing to min/max was required.  Turns out that was well beyond what was needed.  Now people are starting to realize that meme specs are still usable as we don't need full epics to clear MC or kill Onyxia.
---
....on a PvE realm...?
---
Or the UBRS key... or the Ony key...
---
That is a real nice way of describing it in RP!
---
you can wear 2 rings and you get the effect from both of them as long as the effect stacks (and I can't off-hand think of an effect that wouldn't).
---
Interesting, but I know it‚Äôs not full game bis‚Äîby the end of classic you shouldn‚Äôt be using accuria. I just spoke to a guild member who tanked naxx on a Druid.
---
Oh there's absolutely no point in doing so, but it's fun and the Rend event takes forever anyway, so might as well get the CD rolling and have fun melting him.
---
If you're doing a serious run and not just durping around with guild members, keep your Reck for later.
---
Yes, Barov. You can outrange him in his room just like Rivendare in UD strat. Just stand far away from him.
---
26% crit is easily achievable with pre raid gear and dagger spec. Combat swords pre raid is like 23% crit without consumes, and daggers get +5% crit from tree
---
Ignore flasks for the most part unless you're going to be regularly clearing MC/Ony each week or you're going to be serious with PvP in P2. 
---
Free Action Potions, Limited Invulnerability Potions, and Invisibility Potions will always be useful and will always sell. FAP mats can easily be farmed in Ratchet too which is a great way to make gold at lower levels.
---
This is why I regret not making my Rogue a Gnome lmao
---
Sorry, zug zug
---
You will come here many, many more times.
---
You keep factoring in price into how good it is. Price is not a factor in how good it is. Also 13% better is fucking insanely massive.
---
There is nothing like that in Classic
---
As a priest, you are very well equipped for high level fishing due to levitate.  Whether you enjoy fishing is another question. :)
---
I've carried a few people through Cath looking for my Triune. Basically, they can have any and all drops that aren't Triune, I will not roll on anything. When Triune drops, it is mine. They still fucking roll need. Fuck this game.
---
I played priest back in vanilla/BC/Wrath and I'm leveling a priest now in classic.
---
Your dungeon damage is going to be lacking just because it takes time for Pain ticks to add up and it is like THE spriest skill. It'll be better at later levels when the bosses are more significant and last longer, giving you more time to rack up dot damage.
---
The trade-off for some lacking damage in dungeons is shadow priests are nearly Jesus-tier in pvp with fear + SW:P bringing them low and then going nuclear with Mind Blast. It's one of the cool things about Classic! Each class has vastly different strengths.
---
The secret: "Don't get killed by ?? enemies, Become the ?? enemy".  Though, I like to do Hemet's quests early then leave STV until 40 for the same reason.  I tend to play at off hours so it's not as bad. Peak hours STV is just a shit show.
---
Just did this yesterday. You can pull him all the way up the stairs like OP said.
---
So your movement binds are completely on your mouse? Seems so foreign to me.
---
For leveling/grinding mobs out.  Without wand or spirit tap, you'll struggle until you get a lot of gear.
---
Yeah, play an alt when you're not with your friend.  Your main will chill but gain rested.  No other way to turn off xp than to not get xp.
---
I really enjoyed the read. Thanks for sharing.
---
Travel form and run away
---
I have never played with a tank like what you describe. The only reason I can think of you are pulling agro is because you started healing before the tank could apply decent threat to all targets. Are you applying a hot before the pull? Did you top off the warlock when you shouldn't? 
---
There really isn't a reason a warrior absolutely cannot tank with a two hander.
---
This guy grammars
---
Is there a scheduled time for update tomorrow?
---
No. Just stop leveling alone.
---
It‚Äôs a 10% drop rate
---
&gt; The dps meter ban has also had the effect of a lot less dps are pulling off the tanks.
---
brb, implementing dps meters ban.
---
But I don‚Äôt want to run away üò≠üò≠
---
Damn, that was really weak lol.
---
I was expecting something even resembling a reason to be a scumbag ninja, but nope, you just solidified what a scumbag you are tbh. 
---
Rape jokes and ninjaing, and then tries to defend it because someone was talking shit to him. Like, what kind of horrible upbringing do you kids get these days?
---
im a spriest
---
I threw so many enemy players into the sea when they were autorunning in Bootybay.
---
24 rogue here. Very casual player. Looking to eventually move up on dungeons besides Deadmines but no sure what level to make the transition. 
---
Would it be stockade next? Or BlackFathom Deeps? Since I‚Äôm DPS should I wait til I hit a higher level? Don‚Äôt want to look like an idiot or bring a group down a peg.
---
I was talking about guiles not high lvl ppl, sorry if it sounded like that
---
A really shit warrior? Are you sure? Whats peak efficiency warrior farming look like so I can make an apt comparison?
---
Talking out of your ass
---
what's your main char then?
---
low to mid level herbs are super cheap still, you can probably level alchemy to 150 on my server for 10g by buying materials on AH.  Just farm up some rugged leather, sell it, and use that money to fund leveling your alchemy.
---
Herbalism, Mooncloth CDs, alchemy xmutes, general dungeon gold, skinning, mining...
---
*Mind blown*
---
THANK YOU
---
to clarify, thats what I got as an answer from a hunter who told me he needs them badly (though he already had peacemaker)
---
You can level up a lock using just the mouse. Send in pet, click dots spells, wand. Or drain tanking turns it into send pet,  couple of dots. Lifetap, drain life, repeat last 2 spells.
---
Fair point.
---
You can heal shadow all the way to 60 no issues
---
Any Hunter ~~rolling on Dal'Rends~~ is just ~~un-informed or an~~ asshole.
---
Signed,
---
Warriors ;)
---
You had a rogue phase lmao
---
Always thought that pic looked like James Hetfielda bit
---
I absolutely hate those tunics but the stats were too good not to use it..
---
You forgot the even more important part of this. None of the "Data" that supports those classes being the best was done in a total vacuum without the supporting classes. Paladin buffs, druid buffs, shaman totems, etc.
---
Salvation buff from paladins is huge for mages and rogues because it allows them to go HAM on things without having to worry about peeling from the tank.
---
Aspect of the Wild is HUGE in AQ40, and still incredibly useful in Naxx. Hunter's aren't going to get on the top of the dps board, but the utility they bring for a lot of fights even in Naxx outweighs it.
---
Lastly, you have rogues padding their stats right now. Just ran a dungeon where the rogue always solo'd an unmarked target just so he could get all his combo points up. It slowed down the whole run by probably 20% because the healer was blowing so much mana healing him. (despite my plea to the healer to stop healing him, some healer's just can't let anyone die.) The rogue then had the nerve to say "top of the dps chart." It's just garbage play.
---
Well definetly use fairie fire as soon as you see one. That will kiss them tbe hell off and demoralize them. Then just use your strategy.
---
If I pull a pack and dps are pretty much unloading from the get go, it's better to get at least one attacking me as quickly as possible, preferably the one taking the most damage. 
---
I'm not actually using it on cooldown, but there are situations where it's perfectly fine to use it on a target that you think might rip aggro off you. If I've only put on white damage on a mob and my maul misses or gets dodged, I might know that the incoming frostbolts or melee will peel them off me. In this case I just pre-emptively taunt to keep positioning. But the time the taunt effect wears off it might be 30% and their threat doesn't matter anymore, I can work threat on others.
---
Point is, taunt is the only real tool as a tank. The rest is left up to dps to learn that their damage doesn't really matter, just when they apply it.
---
Yeah, that's the kinda shit where you masterloot it. You're literally only there for one thing, and if they aren't ok with you  guaranteeing you get it, then they can find someone else and you can move on.
---
Just make your own melee cleave group as nobody should need it
---
This is a misconception. 
---
If you run the numbers, it‚Äôs extremely clear that higher ranking spells are more HPS, and more efficient heal/mana. 
---
Downranking heals should be reserved for when you have +healing gear. Since +healing gear statically increases output across all ranks, it disproportionately effects the efficiency of low ranked spells.
---
It really really helps me a lot. I appreciate you taking time to teach me!
---
The only thing I‚Äôd add is that while 50 is acceptable for arena runs as someone said, 52 is the magic number in my experience for the arena/angerforge loop...purely from an aggro perspective when trying to sneak past mobs.  At 52 you can walk the line without aggroing the huge mob of spectators...provided you‚Äôre perfect.
---
51 and below and it often becomes a shitshow.
---
what's drink walk?
---
Could also have a single thread for everyone posting about their rolls.
---
thanks, I will look into these sets, I also havetailoring but I think that I neglected it and that its around 150
---
But you get the best of both worlds.
---
Haha, I was so glad to go back to a robe. I actually bought a BoE blue because I was sick of the dorky tunic.
---
Think about why you want the new profession. 
---
Are you wanting to make money with it? Do you want some cool perk? 
---
It‚Äôs probably faster and easier (and cheaper) to AH farm supplies for any profession grind when high level. 
---
Enchanting is fun, but very time consuming to make money. 
---
Alchemy has a lot of competition and you‚Äôll make a decent amount of money just selling your herbs. 
---
Tailoring has some great robes. But not really gonna make money off it besides selling your 24 hour cloth and maybe bags. 
---
Engineering is all about personal fun. 
---
Etc.
---
Throw back to vanilla when I, as a 13-year old, made a guild called Ur Mom Is My Epic Mount... and a few days later got contacted by a GM who renamed it to Guild Of (my in game name) .. ugh
---
Ah, the wild west days of Vanilla. These are the sorts of oversights I'd've jumped on if I ever got to play in those days.
---
I'm thinking this is likely intentional by Blizzard. I don't think it's a bug.
---
It's all about that explosive ending.
---
Ty for the info
---
Nah, you have 3% mana, that's more than enough. 
---
PULLING
---
I need to work on reacting fast I‚Äôm usually not prepared and a rogue jumps me and I suddenly forget all of my keybinds until it‚Äôs too late üòÇ
---
Your instances sound retarded as fuck.
---
Horde runs from Tristfal.  The Bulwark
---
Yeah man, those level 40 steamers should have been testing 10 man level 60 content that requires a key....
---
Just have them join my guild. Fucking Leaf 5 weeks in a row at this point I think.
---
On the other hand, I feel like just leaving when the tank just stand there doing fuck all until everyone is at 100% mana.
---
Like bro, it's a single mob, just clear it while I drink.
---
Sword of zeal too but probably even harder to get than krol blade. Personally I got a krol blade for 200 g and I'm very happy(ive seen it to from 200-300 on my server). I did/have seen enough rend runs to know how miserable I would be trying to get dal rends. Pick pocket farming in brd is 30-40g an hour so 5-8 hours of farming was worth it for me. And now my guild is clearing ony 20 man every week so I'll eventually get a viskags.
---
I have no issue with blood-elves - imho they fit just fine. As for lot of people rolling them ... well everyone was playing "legolas" on the alliance side before :-D ; But to be honest I don't think people will roll BE/ Draenei as much in "classic" - the kind of people who want to play this exp. are more focused on min-maxing and B.E. arent all all that great.   
---
Shamans and paladins ? While it hurt the mystique of the other factions it surely did help the game a lot - no more useless loot your faction couldn't use, you can design encounters better if you don't have to think about lacking shammy/pala on side, and more tanks/healers for horde and more healers for alliance. Having more tanks is always a +.  
---
Flying did hurt the world pvp, I agree BUT, don't forget that at the start of the expansion there was massive world pvp - as all the players are funneled in the same zones + you have world pvp objectives which have good loot people want. And at the end of expansion there is Isle of Queldanas where there is no flying and MASSIVE world pvp.  
---
Dailies - came at the absolute end of expansion. + They weren't mandatory content - people choose to do them because gold income = which in end lead to massive world pvp in the zone.   
---
Arenas ? I am not all that much of a pvp player but people did enjoy them as far as I know. And again not mandatory.  
---
And now the good things :   
---
Pretty much all the specs are atleast reasonably viable ! Feral tanks, protection pallies ! Considerably less consumables to stack before raid (the battle + guardian elixir system) ! Buffs last longer (paladins stopped being buff bots). Absolutely amazing raids ! Great and hard heroic dungeons !  Guild banks ! Focus frame !
---
My sense of justice demands that I assume they've learned their lesson.
---
-confused in dagger rogue-
---
I would suggest creating some characters (both horde and ally)  on the destination servers and trying to get a feel for how things are... how many people are in the starting zones?  Do a bunch of /who commands:  /who scarlet monastery, /who blackrock spire, /who sunken temple, etc.  You should be able to get a feel for the balance of horde vs. alliance ratio and the population.
---
It just saves about 10 minutes or more.
---
Yeah but just holding my left mouse button
---
They do not show live maps you have to compare minimal to them. It shouldn‚Äôt be hard.
---
There's plenty of reasons. Tanks not being able to survive for more than 3 seconds after charging in. Groups refusing to CC. Using battle stance to charge in and not switching to defensive stance. I've played with 3 tanks in the past 2 weeks like this.
---
What are you attempting to accomplish with this spec?  You are so deep into shadow that you have gimped your healing.  Yet you aren't deep enough to be viable for damage.  If you are attempting raid utility either in BGs or raids, you aren't going to do much with Vampiric Embrace.  Without PI or any holy talents, you lose a lot of healing capabilities.  I would take 6 points of out disc and put them into shadow.  Or take 4 points out of shadow if you want to keep silence.
---
Shadow weaving builds, typically 31/0/20 work when you have warlocks who can take advantage of the buff.  But even then, you aren't doing damage, you are keeping the buff up and providing raid heals.  A lot of pvp builds do get silence but grabbing VE without the next two talents makes it heal for pitiful amounts of damage.  Those three points could be better spent on Force of Will for higher damage.
---
never really thought about checking the vendor price for when I outgrow the item. thanks good advice, thanks!
---
In RFK you can climb the right vine to the first boss then jump over to second boss and skip the side areas
---
What do people who roll on PvP servers expect?
---
STV is an amazing zone, and is by far my favorite to level in.
---
Well all this stuff should not need to be communicated, it should just be understood. When I dungeon spammed to 60 on my mage I probably only had a pug tank 5 or so times, I was lucky enough to have guildies roll alts with me so we could have farming alts/have another tank/healer for a 2nd MC every week.
---
On my druid main I tanked a lot (also healed too when i didn't have to tank but it was a lot easier to find a group tanking most times) and had to pug a lot and holy crap there are a lot of bad mages. Nothing in this game is remotely close to mechanically challenging but some people just have 0 game knowledge or patience. There would be times when mages are 60% mana and would stop drinking to start AoEing before I could generate threat, then run out of mana mid pull. I just added those to my "baddie" list and when I encountered them later we would not invite them to our MC pugs
---
Yep. I really should have. Didn't think it was necessary. I took them through 4 runs including the optional boss each time doing like 70%+ of the DPS for each encounter. I'm at the point now where I may just solo it or grab a tank and healer friend to rush it for the drop. Shouldn't need to masterloot a single item when I'm helping gear mid-high 30s. The hunter that won it can't even wear it for 2 fucking levels.
---
I am around level 50 and I keep having to go turn in quests there. Its way faster to buy a port in IF than take the boat.
---
Greens are worth more than these. Seems like waste of getting upset.
---
Yeah, this will be totally fine to do as long as it's not a mainstream exploit and streamers do it.
---
Don't know how many times I've tanked BRD now and can say the most common mistake is failing to LoS. Healers are often the worst about it, granted that's in part b/c they get aggro and don't realize it. I always put a mark (square) over myself (tank) and tell everyone to stay on top of me. Hunters QQ they can't dps and if we have a Mage I don't care if the hunter can't dps. Better mage water this week in DM will help everyone to regain more mana in those precious seconds they are getting to drink.
---
What is the best way to make sure I'm attacking the correct target?  I have always used the target of target function to attack what the tank is attacking, but I have always wondered how frequently I should be targeting the tank to attack his/her new target during a battle.  Generally what I've done in the past is to target the tank's target near the beginning of the battle, then once that's dead, re-target the tank to acquire his new target and kill that mob.
---
I prefer when tanks mark skull because it avoids this guesswork, but not all tanks do.
---
Basically my question is, how frequently should I be changing targets to ensure I'm attacking the same mob as the tank?  If the tank switches targets to pull aggro off a DPS or Healer, should I also be attacking that target or does it make it harder for the tank to get the aggro off the DPS/Healer when I do that?
---
I straight up tell my dungeon groups to "leave me alone with the boss for a good 10-15 secs so that I can pump threat" and they almost always jump in after a second or two.
---
yea off hours can work. I did one of the hermet quests and just noped out to desolace
---
I think it‚Äôs a good strategy.  Dude seems like a riot to play with. And if true, isn‚Äôt a try hard douche bag that takes the game too seriously.
---
Bloodfang has a really healthy population, alliance/horde ratio is almost 50/50. There are about 25k active characters according to the last report.
---
We have seen a lot of new people that transfered to Bloodfang.
---
I dont know about the other realms but I am having a great time in Bloodfang. Good community for sure.
---
Correct.
---
I‚Äôm shadow though! So I dot, wand, then renew/flash heal for dungeons. I haven‚Äôt bothered training my other heals.
---
YES, but this one is different lol

Well he pulled a power move on Blizzard, and renamed his character FreeHongKong, an obvious violation of the ToS, but given current events if Blizzard suspended him the media would report it as "Blizzard bans streamer over Free Hong Kong name" which would be a PR nightmare for them.
---
So you can‚Äôt move and free rotate the camera simultaneously?
---
Don't hesitate to do strategic running away and switch forms, druids gotta use their big ass toolkit when they can.
---
Im a druid with herbalism and alchemy both around 180. I just read that alchemy is not worth it when leveling still. 
---
Is it too late for me to switch it to skinning, as that will help me get feral gear later on? And at max level maybe even take engineering instead of alchemy
---
Tanaris, you should of left stv by 40 already.
---
BFD is fine.  Most innkeepers have a dialog option that will result in them telling you what dungeons are appropriate for your level.  SFK would also be fine, but that's pretty annoying to get to if you're low level alliance.  Stockades is  also in your level range.  Here, found this:  [https://www.pcgamer.com/wow-classic-dungeon-instance-levels/](https://www.pcgamer.com/wow-classic-dungeon-instance-levels/)
---
Yo! Save some pussy for the rest of us my guy.
---
Update ElvUI, new versions do this automatically
---
People go out of there way to farm negative karma? I know about positive karma farms but what's the point of negative (or for that matter positive farm lol)?
---
yeah the colour is what really makes it unique and idk if u can tell at all in shadowform :/
---
This is the case, but if you are honored by a faction you get a 10% discount off of the cost of the mount.
---
I'm not sure what you are looking for if you are not looking for a detailed explanation on threat generation. Threat generation is the core of tanking. If you are looking for something more high level, I can give you tips from my warrior tanking days (BC+). I am currently full time tanking a druid in Classic.
---
Initiating fights as a warrior tank should occur in one of two ways: charge or pull, depending on the proximity of the group of mobs to other groups and whether you are fighting a mob that attempts to escape. You should always charge when possible to generate rage.
---
Use Bloodrage when it is off of CD to generate additional rage, but don't use it when your health is getting low.  Keep both of your shouts up, but don't spam them as it is a waste of rage. Prioritize Shield Slam, then use Sunder to get all enemies to full stacks. Never focus on attacking a single enemy unless you have lost threat and need to regenerate it. You should essentially Shield Slam&gt;tab&gt;sunder&gt;tab&gt;sunder&gt;tab and so on until Shield Slam becomes available again, then use it on the next target. You can use Thunder Clap, but it is not always necessary. You should save this for particularly difficult fights.
---
Lots of people will say the same thing, that tanking is easy. I know that does not seem helpful, but it is the truth. It is very straight-forward. As a warrior, you are almost always going to Charge&gt;Shout&gt;Sunder and tab after every hit. Hope this helps.
---
Stealth runs with a druid/rogue combo is doable. You can also probably solo it with a warlock, but you would need invisibility potion. (mc helm and gnomish cloaking device helps as well, but have CD's).
---
The one on to the left?
---
I have an alt I play with a group of friends. We're all 23/24 right now. Stockades and Shadowfang Keep were both easy. BFD was harder, but still manageable. A good rule of thumb is to look up the level of the last boss for each instance you want to do. If your group's average level is 2 or fewer below the last boss, it'll be an easy run. 3 levels below is an average run. 4 below is hard, but usually beatable. 5 levels below is not winnable for a typical group.
---
This sword was featured in the classic handbook 15 years ago, wielded by a dwarf killing level 8 yetis near Kharanos.  
---
I'll remember that for as long as I live.
---
As much of an un-fun buzzkill as this will make me seem, I kind of agree with
---
&gt; Comprised of partial or complete sentence (e.g., "Inyourface", "Welovebeef", etc);
---
Those always look super dumb and awkward, IMO.  It's supposed to be a *name,* not a phrase or sentence.  It seems petty to report them, and I never have, but I probably would if I played on an RP server.
---
Mace spec is amazing in pvp. It was the the best in pre made bgs.
---
Some tank will still use it at max. They set up a macro to equip/use then reswap to their original helm
---
Like how do you deal with no strafe lmao. You must not PvP I‚Äôm guessing
---
I rolled a warrior because I missed 1h fury. Dual wielding 2handed weapons is just so ridiculous. And I don't enjoy tanking, so I won't.
---
Yes. A Rogue and enha shammy. I have no regrets :-D
---
(I'll end up farming it for them anyways probably)
---
Curious, what server are you on?  I can see on Faerlina/Herod, but on a server like Bigglesworth I just don't see that much of a desire for tanks in LFG channels.  At least enough where they can say all non needed BoE/BoPs are on reserve to them.  I've only been able to get 1 run for living strath where 1st orb was guaranteed to me.
---
true yes you can stun and gouge and whatnot and level as daggers, its still less efficient then just using non daggers.
---
Everything I've heard about Feral Druids says they're *less* gear dependant than Warriors, which would mean if they're "much better" threat in later phases with better gear, then logically they'd be *drastically* better threat now, when the Warriors have less gear to close the gap.
---
I've also heard that they have good enough rage generation and little enough that they *really* need to spend it on to maintain threat that they *don't* actually need to be the one getting hit to cause their full threat.
---
So it sounds more like very well could be Druid threat being really good over his Warrior guildmate sucking.
---
I'm glad you liked Desolace and SoS I hated those places.
---
It is always a hindrance in BGs. It triggers GCD and when you rez you have to at least rebuff Demon Armor so you're looking at 50% longer to actually get on your mount than if you had a normal mount - every single death.
---
Same. We were number 3 on our server. We originally had so much fun. Until AQ40. Then naxx was just icing. We were super close and would log into each other's accounts to do the 20 man raids so we didn't have to play the same characters day in day out. Oh well. Still going to enjoy this classic experience.
---
Haha. It was not a good look for me.
---
Banned
---
Why on Earth would you have to delete your paladin in order to main your mage?
---
I started at 52. But Fireguard Destroyers(elementals that appear after you open the hall to Anger) hit like trucks and it can be fairly more involved than your used to healing(how good your group is can really help there. Most lower city/prison is doable.
---
&gt; There would be times when mages are 60% mana and would stop drinking to start AoEing before I could generate threat,
---
THIS. This is exactly what I was griping about, haha.
---
But still, I think communication goes a long way. You'd be surprised how many folks are new to all of this content. I'd say most PUG groups I run now consist of at least one person who has not done this content before.
---
A few more spells than just that.  You need to be casting smite and MB if you want to kill your mob before Phase 2.  Wanding with just SW:P is agonizingly slow and unnecessary.
---
Source (40 disc priest)
---
Waiting as long as possible to heal and seeing my target backing up in panic right before the heal hits is my meth
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm not specced for feral unfortunately, but I see what you mean. My main problem is whatever that opener they do where it stuns you for 20-something seconds (I‚Äôm not sure what it‚Äôs called, sorry, first time playing WoW and I know nothing about rogues other than that I hate them) where I can‚Äôt shapeshift or really do anything during that time and then they just follow it up so fast with all of these other things that I typically haven‚Äôt even been able to get more than 2 or 3 spells off before I‚Äôm low health. I dunno, I need to make friends with an alliance rogue to duel for practice or something haha.
---
Thank you.
---
Yes, and I believe the pally one too
---
&gt; As soon as a rogue so much as looks in my direction I‚Äôm dead
---
This is simply a gearing issue then. Get more armor. Get more stamina. Win. Almost every class will have to give up some PvE stats to perform acceptably in PvP.
---
Well, that‚Äôs step one:  Don‚Äôt panic.
---
Every encounter is different.  But against most rogues probably end up using some combination of Nature‚Äôs Grasp, Faerie Fire, and Bear Form.
---
It was so well ingrained into the world (my first MMO) that for the longest time I would refer to servers in other games (WoW) as "shards" on occasion, and would then have to explain what I had meant to people who didn't know wtf I was talking about.
---
A little too similar to Hunter, but might be worth a try is Paladin doesn't work out.
---
Should be at least 1 in every group
---
He's asking about getting the 10% honored price discount.  he'd have to be Exalted to get other race mounts (though the robochicken is not available for other races, iirc).
---
Blizzard will intervene in extreme cases. For example, killing NPCs in an opposing faction's village is allowed, but repeatedly killing them on respawn to the point where it hinders the ability for the players to play the game is when Blizzard will get involved. This could be one of those cases.
---
I level as Frost because I die a lot and I need the slows and freeze
---
Not intended. As a hunter you can reset these mobs by pulling then feigning. It'll reset to normal, then you can kill it for xp/loot.
---
My friend got to 58 with the name Slutblood. They didn't just force a name change, they dropped a 24 hour suspension on him too. 
---
He made it to 58 with anyone reporting him. What ended up doing him was he won the Blackstone Ring and the person he lost to reported his name in spite
---
Tanks should also get this.. really useful to know when they‚Äôre coming. For example you‚Äôre in a tight spot and at 20% and about to bust a cool down... or you‚Äôre at 20% but you see a massive incoming heal waiting for you. Cool down saved.
---
Based on no evidence other than the anecdotal whining of people on forums.
---
I'm having the opposite problem. I'm closing in on 60 as a Sub rogue and looking at raiding in a few weeks and shedding a tear for all those sweet Sub abilities that I may never see again due to the price of respeccing.
---
There may be the same amount of BiS for healers, but the drop rates are a lot better than for tanks.  3% on the trinket, and like 1% on the savage gladiator chain(when you account for the boss RNG).
---
In my experience the healers gear up faster than the tanks in regards to arena/angerforge runs and end up wanting to do something else.
---
I‚Äôve grinded the shit out of it, and most mages and healers have moved on if that makes sense.
---
One side has living boars, the other is all skeletons.  Easy to distinguish.
---
Blizzard would never consent to releasing data about which faction predominantly has more kills versus lower levels of the enemy faction. Having played both factions quite extensively I would be surprised if it was not 80:20 or something ridiculous, where horde has killed more lower levels.
---
Think of the mechanics of drinking; mana always ticks up at the same rate, and if you have the water buff when a tick occurs, you get that much additional mana. So instead of just sitting and drinking, you can walk and pop a water just before every tick, then immediately get up and walk more right after the tick. Burns through a shitload of water but you can effectively drink while moving. As a mage (or with a mage in your group), free water is basically what enables this behavior cause otherwise it would obviously be fuuuucked up expensive
---
Both suck
---
&gt;Your paladin will never tank endgame
---
Objectively false
---
&gt;Your paladin *will never be a main raid tank*
---
Fixed for you.
---
Paladins are great offtanks, preferred for some fights, and I would argue they're the best 5man farming tank.
---
ive had healing and fiery wrath drop which are confirmed but nothing else
---
I like to stand next to the lift down to 1k needless and MC people coming from the barrens down the cliff, being able to do this is the only reason I rolled priest on a PvP server.
---
"Hello fellow PvP server player, welcome to your first contested zone!"
---
Might be childish but I still find it funny, they die more or less on top of the Spirit Healer so it ain't really wasting their time either.
---
Oh, news to me...
---
Hm, thanks. I have mostly cloth things on for int/spirit/+healing. I didn‚Äôt even think of picking up a separate set for PvP/open world, so maybe I should pay a visit to the AH... except I‚Äôm broke. So maybe I will just put that on the back burner for now üòÇ
---
Between multiple mana gems, evocation, pots, etc etc. Unless your raid takes an eternity, mana shouldnt be an issue until very close to the end
---
Firestone is awful. I'd look for the offhand from the SM graveyard boss, combine it with Hypnotic blade (mainhand dagger) from SM library boss. It's a good combo that will carry you into your mid 40s.
---
My nephew's name is Arthas
---
There‚Äôs no way he only contributed to every other pull, without his dps I‚Äôm sure he had plenty of time to top off his mana while you guys clear trash 1 by 1. This circlejerk against mages is just getting pathetic.
---
If you time the tick when you would regen mana, you can drink (regen mana) walk for a short while, then drink again on the tick you would regen mana to get the added drink regen instead of your normal regen based on spirit, allowing you to reposition (albeit slowly) while still getting full mana regen. 
---
Probably not worth the extra effort but it saves a noticeable amount of time (maybe 2 minutes per SM Cath run) if all your mana users are doing it, plus with mages water is free.
---
Its used for solo play like maraudon farm and any other solo farm ofc. If you go into raid with this, expect to do about the same dps as a prot warr.
---

I have a macro that sets pet to passive, commands pet to follow, then cast feign. Only way I've gotten fd to work properly and it still fucks up once in awhile.
---
It‚Äôs not too late. Getting to 180 skinning would take about 45 minutes.
---
Honestly I have no idea why they do it but they do pop up on random threads and purposely try to annoy people so they can get negative karma normally its the people who constantly insult people across various threads.
---
I think you are a prolly right when I comes to dungeons. But I can‚Äôt help it. The meters on the bosses is what I was trained to focus on while raiding through BC, WotLK, and Cata, and I just can‚Äôt (or don‚Äôt want to) kick that mindset. That said, I‚Äôm still able to put out very good dps on trash, assuming the tank can hold aggro. I just can‚Äôt, as effectively, kite large packs of mobs indefinitely.
---
well you don't really have to worry about threat at all in retail where as back in classic and even TBH to some extent, threat was very much something you had to deal with. They even changed a bunch of threat dropping talents since then.
---
Is there any explanation as to why not? If you pop reck on emberseer, the cd on reck should be up as soon as rend comes out. 
---
You want to be using your abilities as much as possible.
---
Thats the plan, I ran out of dust early last time
---
Yeah I don't generally play games with KoS communities. Nothing more fun than logging into games like Rust, getting shot down until I'm bleeding out, then having to listen to my character scream for an hour until it dies.
---
&gt; like by some act of god the 3 second taunt is going to allow the warrior to build enough aggro to keep the target on him. 
---
Taunt sets your threat to the current #1 threat holder, switches aggro to you, AND forces the target to attack you for 3 seconds no matter what.
---
You should have a second set when out in the world that's all leather and prioritizes spell damage over healing. The leather will multiply in bear form. Just whittle the rogue down and be in bear form anytime they connect to you.
---
My very first time I even heard if Deadmines was right after Dire Maul was released, and the girl called it VC, so I always called it VC and I am ok with that.
---
Did something happen to macro queueing? After the recent update, every time i fire a macro I stop movement.. as in: If i were side stepping and i have a macro for intercept/hamstring, i stop moving to hamstring.

Ahhh makes sense I play pvp

As a lock, I keep my health between 60-80%. I'm more than happy to eat your hot into more mana. At the end of a grueling fight I'll be nearly OOm and have \~60% health. I'll life tap down to 30% and eat/drink.
---
Yeah, I'm not a fan of Desolace. SoS is okay, but STV is just üëåüèª

Pretty sure agi increases wand damage (I could be wrong). But then, no caster is going to be actively stacking that.

Once you're over the soft cap of 9%, hit is still valuable until 27% hit, just not as much. Crit, for example, becomes better than hit after 9%

Trolls, mon. No other race would look that cool here.

Exactly that. Not enough demand to make a bunch,  but something nice to make when my alts come across some silk or something.

First off it's a joke, my youngest is 4 and I can't even get my wife to log in to classic.

You can generate a 'string' which is your customized stat priority based on your specific character.
---
You can find generic strings online, but it's generate your own string with an addon such as: [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/simulationcraft](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/simulationcraft)
---
I would tank but im a sham. Still do it tho, just not as good as I want.
---
I always thought it was short for procured LOL
---
What's the floating combat text addon named?

or just the font

If I had to guess? I'd say yes but blizzard does what blizzard wants

Yo.

Usually Asmongold manages to piss me off with his trolly antics.
---
But üëåüëåüëå to him for that one.

Probably the butt.
---
Spec kinda sucks. You would have an easier fight with points into feral for the imp stun and charge. You wanna be in leather gear ideally. I'm really not sure how you can lose unless your running in full cloth gear and not using bear form. You just gotta play the long game as druid dot him up and turtle in bear form. Keep FF on him and use your many roots to lock him in place. Look up stormx on YouTube for reference.
---
Sorry for the post being all over the place.
---
Big time saver. When you‚Äôre rich your time becomes more valuable than your gold. 1g means nothing is it saves you 15 minutes and you have like 500g. Especially when you could spend that 15 minutes farming and making like 10g.

How do you know someone is Horde?
---
Don't worry, he'll tell you.
---
Sorry to break to to you but aoe'ing 2-3 or more mobs is more mana effecient than single target, and faster. Also if youre a tank only pulling 2-3 mobs when you have the aoe power of a mage in your group thats on you, wasting everyones time.
---
None of the content in this game is hard at all. It doesn't matter if you're choosing the most practical spec or not, you can still easily clear everything, it just means you have to spend a little more time. (The time does add up though if you're running a dungeon 20+ times for a specific piece.)
---
There was a trick to zoning back into Inner Maraudon if you happen to wipe. I don't remember what exactly it was. But you could run up the one of the centaur statues and and jump into the wall behind it and it would zone you back into inner Maraudon. I cannot for the life of me find it anywhere or find any information on it online. Maybe it was a bug and it was removed. No clue
---
Looks like the Purple Skeletal Warhorse, not the Baron mount

Things might change when I start my guild &lt;Fartbox.&gt;
---
According to all the guides you should be using both and focus on DPS gear. However you should be using extremely fast 1h weapons not a 2h.
---
Just gear and play like you would a regular dual wielding fury warrior except you use defensive stance instead och berserker stance and you can MT every piece of content from RFC up to and including Naxxramas according to the resources available.
---
This is a bug, not a mechanic
---
Instant invite, a dps that never takes aggro off the tank!
---
I must say poeple who gank lower levels are cowards and i see alot off people bragging about it. I dont get it.
---
Yep, got that mixed up, there's even less for skinning to make it worthwhile.
---
I feel your pain, but since I'm a rogue and you don't know if I'm a good or a bad player, my point is about labeling caster/melee. You just described an overall dps problem, not melees only.
---
It's all about the player, not the class.  
---
\- If they are targetting different mobs, they are bad - Melee problem only? No.  
---
\- If they drop group after \[insert any desired item here\] drops, they are douchebags - Melee problem only? No.  
---
\- If they want to rinse and repeat any run without setting it on the invite message, they are the morons - Melee problem only? No.  
---
If we were talking about any kind of cc like sheep, banish, enslave, trap, nova, etc, then the topic would be different, but dpswise, pug hurts everyone, you just had a bad luck and ran with a group of selfish morons, which cannot be responsible for "JUST CASTER OR I'LL LEAVE" comments
---

almost happened to me, but my dots killed her exactly as she rezzed mograine so we just had to kill mograine again without whitemane.
---
Test with Mask of the Unforgiven, see how much the Hit/Crit matters for your playstyle.
---
Go with whatever you have the weapon for. I nabbed an ES in first MC raid...so now I'm 2H, and it works fine.
---
If you get lucky and pick up a phat 2H use that. But not as slam spec. I don't think you have the rage generation to make that viable yet.
---
If you want to be a fury warrior though you should probably hit the try-hard button and grind out your big ticket items like lionheart helm and Savage Gladiator Chest as soon as possible. Take a weekend and go nuts. You'll thank yourself later.

Hahaha love this.

Got ganked in Western Ungoro yesterday about 60 seconds after making a previous corpse run. Spirit res‚Äôd and hearthed our so fucking fast lmao
---
&gt;aggressive mages become
---
yeah its almost like were all spammed nonstop by a bunch of players who are so dumb they cant farm their lvl 40 mount much less their lvl 60 mount, and since they cant afford to buy vendor water like EVERYONE who doesn't have a malignant tumor jabbing their brain, you walk up to mages and open trade and whisper "water", then go to reddit and post and comment 20 times a day about how mages are ruining the game because you cant afford water. By the way, hows the zepplin rides been treating you?
---
Then control your feelings and stop making this a "moral" issue. You got ganked. Deal with it and move on. I played for years in classic on exclusively PVP servers and got ganked all the time, while doing a fair share myself when needed. It's been a part of the game for 15 years and your argument is as old as the game is.
---
Can I world pvp decently as full prot warrior? Or should I go prot/fury because I want to be able to world pvp but also want to tank and not have to swap specs to be able to actually kill someone the same level, just to swap back.
---
I agree, it was meant as a joke since it seems like that is where a good deal of our community spends their time these days
---
Yeah, I don‚Äôt usually use my bear form.. like I said I don‚Äôt really know how rogues work (first time playing WoW) but they usually jump on me out of nowhere with whatever their ability is called that stuns you for several seconds, where I can‚Äôt shapeshift, so that throws me off. Most of the time I‚Äôve been able to get away pvping with just roots + moonfire/wrath + distance + roots again but I guess I need to start whipping out the old bear form more. 
---
And yeah... I think I have mostly all cloth gear, with the exception of my boots (maybe - they might be cloth too). So I‚Äôll see if I can pick up some leather pieces from the AH tonight. Thank you!

I still, to this day, from launch day, have a priest named ‚ÄúDapope.‚Äù

I guess that's why they left in raid leveling and alt boosting exp rates.

---
Again -- bug, not mechanic
---
I don't get people complaining about constantly running SM or ZF. They have to know questing zones exist. 
---
I don't think I've fully completed any zone's quests and only ran each dungeon once or twice at the appropriate level. Never had any issue with being starved for leveling content. Complaining about how boring running 10 SM in a row is like shooting yourself in the foot then complaining about the pain.
---
My worst experience with a healer so far was a Shaman healing SM Library using Rank 1 Healing Wave.  The guy was spamming me with 70 HP heals constantly during fights while complaining that Shaman run oom easily.  I asked him why he healed that way, "It has better chance of keeping the armor buff up."  I was level 36 using a shield ffs, a Ret Paladin in full Str/Sta gear could have kept me up and had less issues than this guy.  I advised him of the 5SR, but he was not keen on changing his ways.  Proceeded to ask if anyone wanted to run Armory after we killed Doan, everyone quickly said peace and left.

60 lock, 29 warrior, slowly losing my sanity on that warrior. 
---
Currently stuck on a quest where I have to kill a level 32 mob and every time I return from a death run to a hunter or a mage or a warlock 2 levels lower than me looting his corpse. It's a hard life that warrior life.
---
Calculate keybinds??
---
Got any proof for that? Cause the only ones labeled VC are only 12 years old, the tail end of vanilla, early BC. And I couldn‚Äôt find any strategy guide that called it ‚ÄúVC,‚Äù so a little proof would be neat.
---
WHY IS THERE NO SOUND
---
For helping the tank and threat in general:
---
1) dont use power word shield on tanks unless really necessary because prevents rage from being hit
---
2) when tank is initiating a big pull, a single hot tick or buff will put the healer on top of threat before warrior has a chance to engage properly. Save all heals/buffs until you see at least one aoe threat move like demo shout, clap, or battle shout otherwise all the unenagaged mobs will run right for you. A pre-big pull pw:s is allowed as it helps delay the first heal till war has proper aggro 
---
3) shield block + revenge is more threat for less rage than 1 sunder (unless talented)
---
I totally forgot those were a thing
---
I'm always pulling with zerker rage and this hardly helps.
---
Leash range on mobs *feels* broken to me too. Haven't seen many people complain about it so I'm probably imagining it. Definitely feels like in WotLK/Cata/MoP era mobs leashed much more easily when you run away. After MoP they started chasing halfway across the zone before they leashed.
---
Hobbs used to do this way back in the day, try looking up their old stuff
---
There was a guy who put up a Fury-Prot DW breakdown a week or two back that was really interesting. It requires a very specific itemization and gearset to work, and some fights require you to go sword-and-board anyway. 
---
The main issue bears seem to face is that the devs had no clue what they were designing originally, so there‚Äôs minimal upgrades available for them in the early raids and your BiS weapon is a level 30 mace with three charges on it. Or a ridiculously expensive World Drop epic. They got a lot of QoL updates in TBC.
---
I mean, if you're following the FSR, tossing extra heals in between ruins regeneration, so I wouldn't say this is actually the case. If I'm at 100% full mana and have literally nothing to do for 10+ seconds, I'll heal a dps, but I've yet to have this happen. Either the dps are actively dying along with the tank, or they're not. Middle ground? I don't know her.
---
Mind soothe is your friend. I started doing arena runs at 49 as a mage.
---
I'm not familiar with the matchup, why is SP such a hard counter?  Don't warriors even have a fear immunity?
---
Let me get this straight...you were MT in vanilla in BRD and in TBC until Karazhan...
---
So you didn‚Äôt MT at all is what you are saying.
---
Yea i probably shouldn't assume p3 is an auto-win.  I've seen some wonky stuff myself.
---
Sssszszszssszzs,ssz,ssw ass es on s
---
You've convinced me. I'm buying a parrot
---
I don't think this is a mechanic. It's more of an exploit (but I'm not judging anyone for doing it).
---
tanked all the way to 60 with a 2h, no issues. yes, other people go aggro occasionally, no it didn't kill them
---
You can see they're in barrens currently and the night Elf is flagged.
---
&gt; Go with whatever you have the weapon for. I nabbed an ES in first MC raid...so now I'm 2H, and it works fine.
---
Problem is when you accept the 2H and use it, and the next raid your good 1H weapon drops and you want to roll on it, everyone will cry about it.
---
*U already have a purple 2 hander, why you wanna roll on 1H.*
---
I think it's better to be patient and not *using your ticket* on an item you're not looking for.
---
I had totally forgotten about that quest! Thanks for the reminder.
---
You're now banned from Moonglade.
---
How is spamming for people saying "no rogues" and different from just saying "XYZ reserved"???
---
That's literally what I wrote:
---
&gt; ... except for maybe shadow priests, frost mages are the best counter to warriors.
---
Where did I ever say you go all in on dps?
---
As a pally healer, I don't have any hots!
---
Not alone.
---
-Warmongers, whitemane
---
Yes, the tank is wasting everyone's time, and not the mage for having the communication skills of a can of beans.
---
Learn to use your words, maybe.
---
I should mention it was a partial pug as well, and some people had never done Onyxia before.
---
Shyamalan twist, he's going back to rend for Felstriker
---
I'd wait. With DM coming out, Runecloth is going to drop.
---
They do get the 10%~ quiver bonus though!
---
I remember this used to happen before too, though I can't say exactly when. Very rarely a mob wouldn't reset correctly and it would be tagged but not in combat. I might be remembering wrong though, I have this feeling that mobs that did that also evade bugged and you couldn't kill them once they got stuck like that.
---
Either way it happened to me last week trying to do The Last Barov. Someone (I'm guessing) wiped and he didn't reset correctly. We decided not to try it and wait for someone else to test our theory that the quest won't work though.
---
Yeah! I mean this is my first toon ever so the whole thing has been a ride. This is my third time back to STV and I'll finally be done with all the quests. I've totally done westfall, red ridge, duskwood so far, STV will be my 4th quest completed zone.
---
I was questing in Searing Gorge the other day and throughout my questing, which lasted for around 3-4 hours, there was an undead rogue at level 60 ganking everyone in sight. I'm a level 52 warrior so naturally I couldn't handle much of a candle on him.
---
One time though when I got opened on, a nearby level 50 priest stopped by and threw me a heal, which made me outlast the CC chain. As it turned out, my damage was more than enough to kill him in 4 crits. He died in like 3 global cooldowns. That was nice.
---
You were very lucky
---
You know, they have entire categories on PornHub of that.
---
Direct heals crit, whether they are single target (flash heal, healing wave, healing touch, etc) or aoe (Prayer of Healing).
---
Healing over time ticks (from Rejuvenate, Renew, etc) cannot crit.
---
A Druid‚Äôs Regrowth spell is a good one to look at for this. It has an initial direct heal with a healing over time effect. The initial cast can crit. The HoT provided after cannot crit .
---
Yeah I'm not saying its definitive proof or anything.  But adding DM will be a patch, there's more than just setting the portal to Active or something such as that.  There are quests and such associated with DM and whatnot from existing NPC's that will need to be added.  It will be a full patch too add in as much content as Dire Maul brings.
---
&gt;I‚Äôve always been a ‚Äúdps on boss is what matters‚Äù kinda person
---
Also, after the bomb goes off, you bandage yourself to save your healers a big heal.
---
Lmao bro I was his OT in BRD tho hahaha
---
Redit
---
I‚Äòve been lucky enough to craft sulfuras lately.
---
I played 2h fury slam (human) in our last raid and was able to achieve very good dps.
---
In theory dw will always be better but 2h is totally viable in my opinion (not only with sulfuras, think of BRE etc.)
---
Someone ‚Äûhas to‚Äú take the 2h weapons in the raid - so enjoy it. :)
---
He could have popped you while you were low, but he didn't. He gave you a chance to have a fair fight my dude.
---
Unless you're the bomb after he dies, then you run up and sit down right in the middle of all the casters drinking.
---
...would you have preferred it if he killed you while you were busy fighting that mob at low health?
---
Yeah... what? He‚Äôs saying he‚Äôs only dungeon tanked until WOTLK when it was trivialized lol
---
Definitely not the case now.
---
Makes the fight 100x harder.
---
Mine is anywhere from 2g 50s to 5g. It's crazy cuz it's just engineering that uses them.
---
When do I need to cast downranked shadow bolt? I currently only have rank 6 on my hot bar. Do I cast it to proc improved shadow bolt and then switch to higher rank?
---
Why would you need to level at level 60?
---
It's so terrible. I can't understand why they would add something so dumb.
---
Keyring was added in [1.11.0](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.11.0).  That was the same patch that added Naxxramas.
---
To your point, however, I think that very few people were asking for the *vanilla* progression experience.  Most were asking for a recreation of *private servers*, which is why we **started** on a recreation of the 1.12 client and not the 1.01 client.  If we were attempting to recreate the Vanilla experience, there would be many, many differences as we progressed through the release cycle.
---
I also believe that the reason the Key Ring was not available from the start is that we are actually using the Legion game client (7.x), which has been modified in an attempt to reflect the 1.12 game client.  Since the Key Ring was removed in patch [4.2.0](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_4.2.0), I think Blizzard is actually having to re-implement the code, which is proving to be difficult for them.
---
Consider just going for the Gloves of Power off Quartermaster Zigris or whatever his name is. He's in LBRS, up stairs from the wolf boss. Might be alot easier and hey... you don't have to do to Sunken Temple. Ugh.
---
They are best in slot until AQ40 pretty much.
---
Love running into melee players in wow
---
Low effort trolling, I think.
---
Who said it was?
---
Oh right, my mistake. Thanks for clearing that up.
---
Hail from Zandalar Tribe
---
Actually during the time I raided in Vanilla, Feral tank druids were a meme.  At most we could use them for one specific fight in ZG.  
---
It wasn't until the last(or next to last) patch of Vanilla that bear tanks got massively buffed.  Fortunately the classic server is running on a patch where bear tanks are strong.
---
"to ask if 100% mana is sufficient to pull on"
---
Laughed too hard at this.
---
I actually haven't downvoted you yet, but now I will downvote both your comments for being an asshole.
---
Im sorry, is this a meme about how every horde douchebag plays?
---
I swear trolls are the gayest looking race..
---
He was a ?? ... fair fight... lol
---
Priests are good healers but you cannot DPS raids as a priest, if that‚Äôs what your hoping to do.
---
Yeah, I wandered all across azeroth on my leveling journey and still missed a few places along the way. Never ended up doing silver pine, dustwallow, and I'm now 55 where it looks like I'll be skipping most of searing gorge in favor of felwood, winter spring, and the plaguelands. 
---
Almost every leveling brackets has multiple places to visit, mixing it up when I get bored of a zone was almost always an option.
---
There‚Äôs two T‚Äôs in thott bot.
---
Yeah, before I used my soul stone. It didn't matter he was a ??. i had no chance at either stage.
---
LOL tanks don't use shields. They dw and wear dps gear
---
would be better to buy felcloth gloves (the pattern releases tomorrow)
---
No one in any scenerio would take a fight they can't win? What are you trying to prove here? Wpvp is unbalanced and very random as it is WORLD pvp and not BG's.
---
Totally understand the philosophy behind that, but as the tank you should be able to determine how much the healer is capable of keeping up with. If you can survive each pull and the healer isnt going oom by the end of it, you're pretty clear. Dps can inflate their aoe or single target as needed, and they will not often be paying attention to what the healer and tank are capable of to be able to make that call.
---
&gt;What would be a good all around build that let me do a bit of everything while leveling?
---
&gt;leveling
---
While leveling, you do not need to go HotW. It's a great spec at 60, because you really need that baseline of Imp. HT, tranquil spirit, and nature's swiftness to raid heal somewhat decently. Sub-60, a healing set with plenty of int and spirit is literally all you need to off heal. I would recommend going a straight feral/balance build for leveling.
---
With that said, you generally do not go imp. rejuvenation and instead get healing touch.
---
I wish people would all use ‚Äúthreatplates‚Äù adding. Nice visual representation on monster health bars that will let you know before and when you pull Afro.
---
Love how any actual shitpost gets 5k+ upvote but a major bug gets barely 200
---
38
---
alliance full of boat
---
At the time the only thing we knew was that pservers were inaccurate, so their experience didn't help.
---
Yeah that makes sense. I'm glad I dont have to farm the melee or tank bis. It sounds competitive and awful
---
Lmaooooo yeah definitely the judgement crown
---
I mean 4% extra damage is a lot.
---
The turn-around point for me as LW was nightscape headbands, I was able to grab thick leather off of the AH and make a profit of anywhere from 10-20s (ish) per headband. 
---
The only reason I was able to afford my mount at 40.
---
I was thinking that too... There were constantly issues with it breaking early, breaking immediately, not dropping combat, etc until they changed it to give you that incredibly overpowered 3s buff where you're immune to everything.
---
Merchant Coast zone title is red tough, which implies it's a Hostile area. Aren't Horde Blue in Barrens until they aggress an enemy player, since it's still a lowbie zone?
---
if deadmines wants to be abreviated DM, it better start dropping level 60 loot, otherwise idgaf about it.
---
Send it to the front page boys!
---
If I were to stop solo questing and started just running instance I would spec for heals so that would help
---
I agree. It does lock you in for quite a while. 
---
I guess it depends on how much competition you want to fight with. We have 6 warriors and 7-8 rogues all drooling over 1 handers that have yet to drop. Only 1 other guy wanted ES so I went with 50/50 shot early.
---
If we had access to ZG already it wouldn't be as bad.
---
Wasn't it converted from a raid to a dungeon at some point?
---
Human Warlock ? Apparently the worst combination of race-class (what I read on lots of portals)
---
Yes raids usually bring less than 3 mages
---
It doesn't last long enough for this to be useful advice.
---
I mean, 4% extra damage is pretty good.  It's doubly good for warriors because the extra attack gives extra rage.
---
SCRATCH FURY, DESTROYER OF WORLDS!
---
they dont, this was a pserver bug
---
exactly.  Had someone reserve something after I joined as tank that I needed to.  But they didn't tell me when I joined.  I new there wasn't a chance of it droppping but WTH that is complete BS.
---
Or you just tank him in the room below where he spawns and let the dps kill the adds as they trickle in from one predictable direction.  
---
Oh yes, even though he's 3 levels higher than any other mob in the dungeon you don't miss or get glancing blows, because he is a golem.  Tanks can hit him just fine even though he might be high orange/red.
---
You can also use the ring in later parts of the dungeons for heals.  I've had that ring save the group from a wipe when the last few pulls before drakkisath go south.
---
I have made a great error, may Ragnaros strike me down!
---
You can also just have a mage I‚Äôve block properly and then the mage won‚Äôt get slept. Then said mage counter spells the rez.
---
On private servers we still got loot for both mobs. I cannot confirm if this works on real classic though.
---
to add on to what Skeptocles said, on private servers the bag was always going between 1-3k gold. on Pagle Mooncloth bags (16 slots) are going between 23-25g each and Runecloth bags (14 slots) are like 2-3g each. Depends on your ability to make gold if it's worth it but personally I think a full set of 14 slots are more than enough.
---
Maybe, but it was my first character and nothing can replace that
---
clearly the flower one
---
....what?
---
all my twink friends have pretty much fully geared twinks ya.
---
Had a charcter namer CokeOCola years back and they banned me for 24hrs and made me change name.
---
I spent some time grinding the bears/spiders in Hillsbrad north of the farm, from the left to the right side of the Dalaran bubble.  This was not a straight iron farm, but allowed me to farm money for the 40 mount while snagging iron in a low population area.  Shouldn't be much competition there for these nodes.
---
Earthshaker is in a fantastic state. I would move. I did and I don't regret it a bit. Tons of raiding guilds to join
---
So no dungeonleveling before 30?
---
Thought so lol
---
To make you feel better. I'm at crystal number 31. :)
---
Use the addon auctioneer. It will tell you what to do with an item
---
I lost money on enchanting until I hit 300 and lvl 60. Now all blue armor bops are a 1-2g profit in excess of vendor due to disenchanting. I also invested in a few BiS recipes and can get anywhere from a few gold up to my highest 20g in tips by doing enchants. It's something that you really have to invest into to be profitable.
---
Saw a guy LF tank for LBRS with a few things reserved, I instead make my own group - he actually whispers me asking for an invite and if he could reserve something and to invite his friend as well. I say NO. After a while, finding presumable no tanks, he whispers me and starts begging for an invite (ditching his friend in the process). At this point I already had a full group and was heading towards the instance LOL.
---
Fastest way is to buy a bunch of ore while smelting it gives skillups then smelt it until it is gray. Go out and mine ore when you can't get skillups smelting. 
---
The most profitable but slow way is to go out and find nodes to mine. "Viable" depends on how you want to do it.
---
Cloth is great for this. Skip investing time in First Aid early on for some classes where it‚Äôs not necessary and scoop them up/train before taking a Zepp to make bandages during the downtime.
---
I feel that, healing zf and the stress i incurred from it turned me away from healing and straight into tanking.  Having to put up with tanks who use 2 handers or have no understand of aggro just pushed me away from it.  Now it's all about having a nice list of healers i can reach out to.  Great heals and decent tanks can make any run easy mode.  Have to form those bonds and really be the mom and dad of the dungeon. The other day I joined a mara group really late, was already full, had a super low level holy pally and 3 warriors.  I know I should've left immediately.  The warriors were all attacking different targets, charging in with me, pally going oom every pull as a result.  Dps got defensive and snooty when I brought up the issues, even as far as saying "I have over 800 days played on a warrior in retail, I don't need to be told what to do."  Yelling "TAUNT!" as he pulls agro for the 15th time in a row.  Total clown show.  But like I said, I should've known, the group makeup told me everything from the start.  But it was late and I was taking what I could.  It's why I form my own groups now.
---
I mained fire back in vanilla.  I miss it, definitely gonna level a fire mage again.
---
I mean the best way is pretty much not what you want to hear but just run around the outer mountainy part of zones, just look up the mining lvling guide online they show good routes and best zones for you.
---
Same for us, it‚Äôs because of the expectation that everyone would roll rogues, no one would roll Druid/warlock etc. 
---
We have 5 druids in our main raid roster and about that many rogues
---
Yerp, seen this a lot. 1 Horde, equal or 1 level off from you? Friendly, /wave /smile.
---
2 or more Horde, or 1 Horde with +4 or higher levels? Gank, every time.
---
It's not like an this specific escort quest in Thousand needles is the only activity available at level 29.  You can simply do something else.
---
That's awesome :) bet he was well happy
---
If you have a good group then go for it but I find many VC and WC groups to be cancer.
---
[Short video of me learning to kite on my hunter](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamController/comments/dc5zay/watch_out_azeroth_dram_is_learning_to_kite/) (turns out the shot timer addon was not accounting for batching. Much better after replacing with another swing timer addon.)
---
Controller is there just for the audience, not actually visible on my end.
---
Minimap is off unless I'm on a character with gathering professions, but I have double tap x bound to minimap toggle. I usually find myself referring to the main map for orientation anyways.
---
That is a func fact! Thank you. Now on which cover did he see octopussy??
---
the npc next to the teleporter will give you a new item for free if you talk to him. you can throw it away after using and just keep getting new ones when needed
---
Priests will be expected to heal late game. Paladins are expected to heal late game. You will see little end game difference between a paladin and a priest, end all be all. Just respec your pally at level 60 (a long, long way off) if you want to be super relevant for end game content? There's no reason you *need* to respec unless you are not enjoying your class/faction.
---
Exactly, all these posts over the last few months:
---
‚Äúand here I am still level 34‚Äù
---
No shit, you‚Äôre repeatedly dying to solo content because you don‚Äôt know how to play your character or use your skills. But keep telling yourself it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre ‚Äúenjoying the ride‚Äù and spent two hours fishing once. 
---
They‚Äôve dried up as people who don‚Äôt know how to use their brains to learn about the game have quit though.
---
This guy is right. I would shoot for ~12% hit. It will increase your white damage a lot which is where a bulk of rogue/warrior damage is from. However at the absolute minimum you need 6% with 305 skill, 9% without 305.
---
Oh man... That took me.back.
---
DURID ARE FOR FITE!
---
I see the discussion literally every time I go to Westfall. lol  
---
People definitely get heated. Some just troll. I personally don't get angry, I just think less of anyone that uses VC.
---
Good reason
---
which quest?
---
Excellent, see you on the battlefield -57 ud rogue
---
Even as a other races as long as you have edge masters they hit really hard.
---
With almost all bis gear I can hit like 4k executes at max rage and around 1.7 to 1.8k with the minimum rage needed to execute. 
---
Honestly, the hands are good to have anyways since you can then start using daggers as well and core hound tooth after all the dagger rogues get it is not a bad offhand.
---
I missed that part of the story, actually. I retract my statement, guy was a fucker.
---
This doesn't stop dumbasses from calling Dire Maul DM... Just as they advertise Scarlet Monastery SM with no attached wing.
---
Your logic works only assuming everyone is smart and never ever makes this mistake.
---
Pve bitch, and I ain‚Äôt flagging for nobody. Hahaha.
---
Gotta use strength 2000 times tho
---
Hell, when I first ran deadmines (as a new player), I hadn't even switched to defensive stance once yet.  We wiped to the first boss as I had no idea how to keep threat and never got past the second boss.  
---
It was a horrible experience but my group was nice and gave tips.  I read my skills and learned what my threat abilities were.  A month and half later and I'm leading groups through BRD and Scholomance like I'm a veteran.
---
To my deadmines group, I am sorry.  Definitely should have prepared myself better but nothing teaches you faster than trial by fire.
---
idk, I have the newest version off github and it was so slow that I switched to Auctionator to scan, since like you said it takes maybe 20 seconds to scan with Auctionator while Aux takes 15-20 minutes.
---
However, Aux is faster at searching for items and when scanning to post items. Strange.
---
A couple things to note. 
---
First, hitting return has no 1 hour wait time.  It's instantly returned.  
---
Second, after thirty days those items returned will be automatically deleted.
---
I'm on heartseeker alliance side, seems like it's pretty heavily alliance sided.  I dont know if that's what you want but it sounds like what you're looking for.
---
Never downrank shadowbolt, lifetap for more mana is more efficient. 
---
You don't really need to cast shadowbolt (outside of Nightfall procs) while leveling though as long as you keep your wand up to date.
---
This has me demoralized. What's the point of all this grinding if you don't get to look dope...
---
&gt;your group members may ask you for your mental health if they see you proccing that talent with DW spec
---
I'm guessing you don't have much experience as a DPS warrior. Deep wounds is a requirement for Impale, which is a critical talent for fury warriors.
---
Welcome to Ask Reddit. Where the question isn't really an honest one, it's just a lame set-up for a predictable punchline.
---
come back, mods. This sub needs an overhaul.
---
DPS that think they're the hot shit because they top the meters are usually the same ones I don't add to my friends list.  I will gladly take someone who does 20% less DPS and brings 100% less stress to the run.
---
I scooped all items off the AH right when DM was announced. Been following the prices the past few weeks and some mats have doubled in value. Should have bought extra and jacked the prices up when DM is released.. oh well
---
Its aticz ui profile for elvui https://wago.io/LOLhsi5JK
---
I give dps 1 power word shield at the last second if things get hairy. If they die through that *shrug*
---
What server are you on that's blessed with an abundance of tanks? On Grobb horde side, dps can be found in seconds, while I have to compete with two other groups looking for a tank for BRD during peak hours.
---
What a dufas.
---
World buffs are really valuable in stats. 
---
Rallying Cry is 10% spellcrit and 5% ranged/melee crit with 140 ap. 
---
Songflower is 5% crit for everyone and +15 to all stats. 
---
If horde warchief's blessing gives 300 hp, 15% melee haste, and 10mp5.
---
When melee hit crit cap at 32.6%, they can just get more hit which increases your white hit damage, which increases rage regen etc. 
---
You don't NEED to get them, but it makes the game really fun. Imagine 40 people fully consumed with world buffs ready to blow a raid up.
---
...but you probably kicked the hunter from your group when it happened :)
---
Good to know! Mostly just dont wanna get on one of those servers you hear about where the horde outnumber alliance 3 to 1. I'm used to a pretty even split on my current server.
---
can confirm this sucks. Happened exactly like you said it also  :(
---
I have gone out of my way to do it but not being labeled the "guild enchanter" means I lose out on potential recipe drops which I did see a +55 healing but was sent to the designated enchanter.
---
Can rogues Solo it?
---
Well there are alot if dps players per tank, so given the option of waiting 1-2 hours to find a tank or conceeding an extremely rare drop that most players will never see, the reserve option looks better to me. But if you prefer to wait, that option is always available to you.
---
Agreed. It would have to be very long term to draw any attention. Still funny though haha
---
If you go raiding you don't need the bag space.
---
If you don't go raiding you don't need to switch between pulls.
---
The reality:
---
Her: There is no her, only you, you sorry sack of shit.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been leveling arms and it‚Äôs been great for dungeons so far. If prot isn‚Äôt needed for 5 man content then I‚Äôm all good.
---
Launcher says 7-8 AM Pacific.
---
I had to Google if guilds are cross-server now because that's the only reason I can think of for why it wouldn't be included. Tied for the most vital piece of pertinent information. The spreadsheet really isn't useful at all without it.
---
Just make a macro to mark skull. Don‚Äôt expect people to have enough IQ to attack what you‚Äôre attacking on their own.
---
It trains just as well on low level mobs. Get an int buff too as that speeds it up
---
Pull the boss back to the room where you killed the 4 stone golem things.

I mean there‚Äôs not really anything to do. it‚Äôs a tank and spank. but yeah it‚Äôs sad how trivial all the end game content was to do even the first time due to these bugs that could have been fixed if they beta tested at end game or even had someone at blizzard who actually played vanilla do a once over.
---
You switch after the buff‚Äôs duration is over
---
The hardest part is finding groups that want to stick together for multiple runs. This will get easier as you hit the high XP density dungeons like SM and ZF, or in the BiS heavy dungeons like BRD, but you'll find a deadzone from 10-30~ish and 47-52~ish as healers don't really wanna spam mara and nobody wants to spam ST.
---
If you can find groups consistently, it's great; and probably better than solo leveling. Definitely easier, if not faster. But it's all about minimizing the downtime in LFG and actually get to where you're killing things.
---
Uh ok
---
But you're not on a pvp server, as he has a blue targeting circle around him. What's to hide from?
---
Funny, I was wondering this exact thing earlier and was just gonna run a timer to figure it out. You saved me the trouble. ;)
---
You are passing on the biggest dps boost as a shadow priest + THE most iconic shadow priest spell for.. Some % of mana and some spirit.
---
Hmm
---
Be careful with that assumption.
---
I fell into the same trap, seeing White Masks (11str 11agi) for sale for 1.5-2g each, while only costing 40s to craft.
---
So I crafted 15 of them to get from 215-225 and barely made any money. I sold 4, only 1 on the AH, and had to vendor the rest. I made a few gold, but nowhere near what I thought I could make. Even the vendor strat is unreliable as mageweave fluctuates so much, and the vendor profit from the mask is only 3-5s to begin with on my server.
---
Pfft, bro, what a 2006 kind of response.
---
We kicked the Mage, obviously.  =p
---
Dude. If you have not made a single macro as a Druid you are fuckin up! Druids need macros to survive. Google them right now. Literally every resto/balance spell is macro‚Äôd for me plus all form spells are powershift macros and if you don‚Äôt know what that means, boyyyyyyyyy you gonna learn today.
---
I‚Äôm so glad this wasn‚Äôt widely known, made like 3k from this since launch.
---
Lmao I think I love you
---
Yes, that‚Äôs the only way. The rate of skillups aren‚Äôt normalized around weapon speed, so you can level up a bit faster if you use a faster weapon. It might be worth checking vendors or the AH for the fastest weapon available. White or grey weapons can be good for this.
---
Sorry we chose the better faction. Also, OP isn't on a pvp server. So there's no fear of being killed.
---
Newly dinged 60 warrior looking for a spec that I can both DPS and tank dungeons with. I'd rather not spec fully into prot if possible because I have a friend that is a well geared druid tank so will dps those runs.
---
Ideally once geared I would sell my tanking services to groups in need. 
---
I know of fury/prot but no TM is painful. Are there any arms/prot tank specs?
---
Does this carry over to pvp? Should a lvl 30 chance to hit a lvl 60 be the same as a lvl 33 mob?
---
No. UBRS was always meant to be completed in a raid.  It simply changed from 15 to 10 man.
---
In the BRD arena, if your party dies to the boss and the encounter resets, do you get the same boss again when you go in the second time?
---
Nice
---
I know! I sort of spammed it since this whole post is auto moderated and I don't know who or how to talk to someone who can fix it! Lol
---
 Someone spent and people spent time building that and really for nothing at all lol waste of effort
---
Doesn't that also apply to all the weird skip glitches people have done in BRD since Vanilla?
---
Mobs won't target immune creatures unless they are the only target or taunted.
---
Physical immune Rogues aren't actually **immune** to physical damage, they just have so much avoidance that they can't be hit by raid bosses. 
---
It is the "Immortal Object" from SAO vs "I JUST CAN'T HIT HIM!!".
---
Funny, I see the exact same behavior from alliance players.
---
If someone types LFG VC you know what they mean.
---
If someone gives them a hard time about it, they're just being a dickhead end of story. 
---
There's no winning for people who arbitrarily correct people when we all know what they mean. At the end of the day, they're just outing themselves as assholes.
---
Haha yeah, To be honest I don‚Äôt really understand macros and I watched a video on them and I still don‚Äôt understand them so I‚Äôve just been running without bc I get overwhelmed easily lol
---
Also yes direbear is worth it! Train everything as you can afford it. Don‚Äôt over spend, prioritize, but dire bear is one that you should def take at 40 for sure.
---
I have no idea what you're on about.
---
Suppose the players are still around though.
---
I honestly think the level difference mechanics in general are just completely broken. Thankfully it only affects dungeons, UBRS and pvp and not 40 main raids. Hopefully it‚Äôs not like this in 20 mans.
---
It depends on your level and spec. As an Affliction lock going the SM/Ruin build I only cast Shadowbolt when shadow trance procs. If you're running a Destro focused build then you would probably start with downranked casts to get the proc. It's also a good idea to look at the dps of shadowbolt vs the dps of life drain, sometimes it's better just to drain them down after throwing on dots.
---
i agree, i just simply remember everything taking longer. not that pyro was ever hard, but rend i dont remember being that much of a pushover
---
this is why i spend the beginning of every fight pick pocketing.
---
I just wasted 2 hrs grinding outside on the instance alone and getting ganked by horde to get it done. Def not worth it
---
Damn right
---
Your hunter and warlock pets hold onto dots from dungeons if dismissed. This will be a big fucking problem when ZG gets released.
---
Yeah it can farm fine, it's a bit gear dependent for Mana and crit and it's definitely not viable in the fire based raids but after that it quickly becomes better.
---
Unfortunately my friends wanted to be alliance when the game was just released and everyone called it VC.
---
And if you ‚Äústole‚Äù an item you placed on the ground, you‚Äôd appear neutral to other players.  Other players who‚Äôd see you in a simple robe and decide you were an easy target.
---
Until you took off the robe and revealed yourself to be a grandmaster archer and won the fight easily, and looted the corpse of your enemy in short order.
---
Yeah it was dirty, but I was 12.  I miss that game.
---
Oh, is that why I constantly pull aggro from the warriors trying that?
---
Fire Spells use 0% on immune mobs
---
Mana efficiency only matters for the healer.  If I go oom, you die.  If you go oom, you level your staff skill.
---
Tanks struggle to hold 3+ mobs.  They struggle more when the jackass mage is aoeing a group down and not burning single targets with the group.
---
Let me break down the math for you.  AoE is more effective when you have lots of mobs.  An AoE does pathetic dps per mob.  It is only in groups when it shines.  However, if your group is struggling to hold aggro on the mobs, having the mage pull aggro from the tank and then the aggro jumps to me because I'm healing, I'm going to get salty.
---
A tank will take less damage when you single target dps than when you AoE, despite your higher dps.  This is because he has to tank 3+ mobs for shorter.  Sure, everything dies at once and the pull is maybe faster.  But if my mana pool can't withstand 5 mobs wailing on the tank, we need to reduce that number now, not in a minute when you AoE everything down.
---
My mage is 49, and uses the Antiquated Noblemans tunic, and the dagger from SM.. My friends call me a level 7 rogue. Can't even dual wield yet.
---
When I was thinking of a shadoweaving priest for myself I really just wanted the silence. And if I could shadoweave for my guild that would be a plus so I don't have to repsec. I didnt want to do big dps or solely heal in pvp. 
---
And mostly the idea was about wpvp skirmishes with 2v2 or 3v3. I wanted to be able to hold my own and support my team but not heal bot them. Also I really wanted to act as a counter support with silence and imp mana burn. 
---
So I guess the idea was more about shutting down an enemy healer or dps so I dont have to rely on my healing as much. I have no idea if that's viable it just seems useful and fun. I will have to try it and find out
---
It has to be at least 5 because of def vs weapon skill calculations at +3 levels. 4 will do nothing for a hunter regardless of the situation.
---
this guild was better when durzog was in it
---
Who needs DM when you have neWt
---
yeah u use fire until u can get blizzard and then its irelevant since then
---
Mana issues... its my 1st priest, so want to see does it worth or not
---
It isn't that simple, spell power coefficients are based on original cast time and if it is aoe / has a secondary effect. Frost bolt is around 80% and fireball had the full amount, but stuff like coc and scorch have their own scaling.
---
I did this fight last night, priests definitely cannot dispel the sleep.
---
not sure. i would like to be self sufficient because i do buy a lot of potions, but i also wanna be able to help my friends. that is why im mixed between alchemy and enchanting. both can help, but enchanting is really cool and you can 'sell' your service
---
yeah, no shit.   
---
" but not till you are past the fire resistant/immune content like MC and BWL. Past BWL, Fire &gt; Frost. "
---

---
The only disagreement I have is "with equal gear and skill".  Druids are less gear-dependent than warriors, and can tank all of MC with a mix of greens and blues.  I'd say normal, in bear, tanking is simpler for druids too (doesn't require much skill, there), but knowing when to use healing for threat, use B rez and other skills is where the challenge comes in.
---
Going into BWL, when warriors have T1, they are stronger than druids, and there are only single slot pieces to help bear tanks, instead of any feral set in the end raids.  But, warriors are the strongest class at end game in both DPS and damage mitigation, so it's not all that surprising.
---
I'm biased because I'm a bear tank main...
---
It‚Äôs the same phenomenon as people getting mad at their rival sports team. It‚Äôs entertaining and keeps people invested
---
I‚Äôm a ‚Äúsolo player‚Äù too. This is just taking it to the next level though, very petty of him not to accept the invite. Would have saved you both some time but people will be people. 
---
Being the solo player I am I still understand that it takes time for a mob to respawn and I‚Äôll actually be the first to invite someone if there‚Äôs a quest mob to kill that I‚Äôm waiting for and someone else pops up looking for that same mob.
---
Sounds very childish of him to not accept your invite, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with grouping up to kill a mob then leaving after to continue his solo play.
---
Arcane is the best questing spec though, specifically if you're on a pve server
---
It is that simple. with gear, fire do more damage. more damage = more gooder
---
Rallos Zek represent.
---
Bitch please, I already have my keybinds and talents since 2 months ago
---
Except that trash is often more forgiving and has a much higher variable in difficulty, depending on how many mobs pulled.  You can CC on trash, you typically can't during a boss fight.
---
5 shamans /s.
---
But seriously, I don't see you having a comp that is going to be even remotely manageable for 5 classes with no duplicates. Hunter is out, because deadzone means you've got to re-position constantly. Any melee class outside of your tank is going to have positioning issues as well. 
---
I would totally go druid tank because they get swipe and roar early, making them good enough at easily getting AoE threat, take pretty much any healer, and then bring 3x mages and have them all just spam frostbolt single target.
---
AoE is going to be a nightmare for threat management, it's all based around rooting and kiting which is not easy to do with a 5 man non-clone multibox.
---
That's what it was!
---
Ugh I thought I was just going crazy, but as a tank I *hate* wiping due to bad pulls. And I'd just occasionally get mobs mysteriously aggroing, but only in that dungeon at a certain spot. But nobody was over there--it *must* be my fault.
---
I feel so much better now. Thank you
---
See, I got asked to pull bigger, so I did then we died because of the baddie mages you described not waiting for me to get aoe threat and pulling 2/3 of the pull off me, now healer is oom halfway through pull because they have to heal 4 people instead of 1 and we wipe, then I get blamed for being a bad tank. Thankfully the healers usually have a level head and saw what happened so we just boot the "gotta go fast" mongoloids and get a new dps.
---
1 Item + all cash on hand, however the original corpse drag command (/consent) would allow someone to loot all of your items (in case you couldn't get back to your body)
---
I guess.. you should vendor it. Auctioneer doesn't think its worth anything.
---
We have only one druid attending MC/Ony and he's gotten pretty much all his set pieces, Druid drops have gotten so bad that like 3-4 of the guild mages have rerolled druids and it's looking like their druids will get full T1 before their mages.
---
I dont think he wants to be a shadow priest. I think op wants to play an offensive support style priest the off heals and can provide cc/light dmg
---
UC and Thunderbluff didnt put up much of a fight last time OC raided either.
---
People arent downvoting the solution lol. There downvoting the dude who assumes everyone knows everything about wow. My buddy is playing classic for the first time ever even touching an mmo and didn't know what a macro was. So if he doesn't know he should just not use it? I like the idea of people asking for help rather then doing something worse cuz you don't know better.
---
I want to drop enchanting (225) for engineering. I don't have mining though, is it worth it to level without mining? How much would it cost me?
---
Can I attack after the tank has landed one auto attack? Or how do I know when to engage?
---
You can move the default character frames. I couldn‚Äôt imagine having my portrait or target that far away from the middle of the screen
---
It doesn't have to be funny to be a joke
---
It didn't make me laugh but it obviously went about 100 miles over your head
---
Yeah, I went back to this approach because folks seem to have a mental block on reserves, yet folks seem to be OK if you exclude certain classes.
---
frostbolt
---
\-Invite another account  
---
\-Make them lead  
---
\-/camp after princess kill  
---
\-Second account resets instance while you're logged out  
---
\-Log back into a fresh Mara
---
PI weaving doesnt do anything for damage on trash. My argument is that since weaving on trash, as you just said, provides little value, its best to have a healer instead of a spriest in those situations. Then you can have a mage or warlock doing \~200 dps more overall for the entire raid.
---
Did someone say 
---
#THUNDERFURY, BLESSED BLADE OF THE WINDSEEKER?
---
Flask recipes are all under 100g right now, they‚Äôre really not that uncommon.
---
Some do, (I do, because thats my jam) but completing every quest is not necessary or even efficient.  Even after you have hit max, quests can be a valuable source of gold and items like trinkets that will remain useful even at 60.
---
Yeah, had that happen a couple of the times I fought him also. I'm a shaman so after the fact I wondered if I left a totem outside that they agreed. They seem to come to life 10 or 15 seconds after the boss comes to life.
---
I‚Äôm a rogue, and that last paragraph resonates with me so much lol. I‚Äôve just settled on my current weaps. I don‚Äôt even wanna run it anymore  and rather rep farm.
---
I mean they don‚Äôt know what they are doing I guess. This has been thoroughly tested to death. By the time you get to SM with whirlwind axe and having sweeping strikes 2h arms is way better. Fury offers nothing for AoE threat minus enrage and misses out on tactical mastery. Enrage is not reliable anymore because you can no longer do a sit macro to get Crit. 
---
Look there are a ton of bad players right now. Especially ones in the leveling brackets still. But if a player knows what they are doing arms is a much better leveling and tanking spec in classic compared to fury.
---
Also what server/level are you? I can just show you as well. I might just make a video explaining to people how this works because people on this sub are constantly just wrong about this.
---
Strictly speaking this is not true.  Once you get to BRD you'll start running into issues.  You certainly can heal BRD effectively right up to the torch room before Thaurissan, but you will have the major drawback of needing to stop and drink quite frequently.  Getting through the torch room healing as a shadow priest will require having a high level group and a lot of AoE.  You're likely to oom way before lighting the second torch.  Same goes for the Thaurissan fight itself.  He hits like a truck.  Can it be done?  Obviously yes, but I made the switch from shadow to holy at level 56.  It's stressful and challenging as shadow.  It's basically a cakewalk as holy.
---
Warriors can learn everything except for wands.
---
[This is mine.](https://i.imgur.com/0ZKhosC.jpg)
---
People like "death and taxes" was a shit tier guild that didn't know anything. *suuuuure*
---
There's a warrior on my server that pugs live strat every single day, and reserves all of the Orbs....and people join his runs. Madness
---
It's on a long cooldown and only deals with one mob. If you get triple enforcer spawns it's pretty much impossible to sustain healing on the tank anyway, the bleed stacks too much. Very RNG dependant.
---
By telling them they aren't allowed to do that. Its already part of the ruleset anyways idiot.
---
Lol damn I was always told ignorance was bliss but you seem to have missed out on the bliss part
---
I think either side works right inside the boss door. You have to jump on the corner to "stick" and jump up again to the top or the ledge.
---
Literally GQuit for 2 weeks in TBC over something like this. (I kept leading raids, I Just wouldn't wear the tag until they removed the pink bunny)
---
If you have a different pace/intensity than the rest of your group, there will be a ton of friction even if there is no overt hostility.
---
Very few people know how to (quickly) dial their intensity up/down. This is a problem when you are going from high-speed perfectionist craziness to a group of stoners who are more interested in taking screenshots than completing the instance, or vice versa.
---
Yeah, dust starts dropping off his body right before he comes to life. Stop summoning and start running when you see it and you make it out with plenty of time.
---
Tell them to point to a talent that males your AoE better in dungeons.
---
AoE spec is just for solo play farming, makes no difference to your AoE in dungons, and you'll smoke them on bosses.
---
Nah. You're leaving available resources on the table. Use your mana! Drink your water! Quaff your potions! Don't wait for the "perfect" time to burn your shit. Kill and keep moving.
---
Now, I'm not suggesting that literally every fight has to tax the group to its limits -- I'm saying, don't stop pulling trash until your healer is &lt; 50% mana, wait after the fight for them to get &gt; 50% mana then pull. Neat side effect: DPS and Heals drinking while the tank pulls allows tank to generate aggro and rage.
---
Obviously if you're about to do a boss or a tough/AOE pull you'll want your healer all charged up.
---
Another anecdote from my RL trio group I run with: We had our priest constantly pulling trash in Cath, absolutely no downtime until we had to move up to a new spot. He'd run out, grab 2-3 mobs, run in, warrior gets aggro, dps starts blasting. When the last mob is about 1/2 hp, he goes out and pulls another small group. DPS and Tank just stand in the same spot in a murder-circle, slurping gallons of water when needed right after last mob dies. Only ever regenerating enough mana to blast whatever mobs are there. Super fucking fast, super fucking fun. The PUG dps we grabbed were all blown away by how smooth and easy it was. 
---
Granted, my little trio are all veteran MMO players (including OG Classic WoW) so we're probably quite a bit above average skill level, and decked out in dungeon gear. Especially our Priest -- very good at knowing how much healing he can put out with the mana he has, and knows how to pull without overwhelming the group.
---
[Yes, right here](https://archive.org/details/World_of_Warcraft_World_of_Warcraft_BradyGames_Official_Strategy_Guide/page/n9).
---
Back page says it is published in 2004, which necessitates that its realease was before dire maul.
---
Not in Phase 1 Vanilla they didn't
---
I had exactly this with a rogue. He only had an hour, so wanted to ‚Äúhurry‚Äù, so decided he would keep pulling (including bosses).
---
The past 6 pug runs of Scholo I‚Äôd done were all sub 1 hour, even with the groups that had some 58-59‚Äôs.
---
But this run? 1 and a half hours due to the rogue pulling like a moron.
---
I know half of the words in this thread.
---
Only transfers from full servers to newer servers. Also anytime they added pay to transfer PvP to PvP servers and 
---
Pve to pve servers never a cross to the other
---
You don‚Äôt have to complete any quest you don‚Äôt want to. Generally speaking the goal is to get to 60 and get into raids to get the best gear in the game. But that‚Äôs MOST people‚Äôs goals. A lot of people love leveling in Classic and once they hit 60 they just reroll. 
---
Unless you‚Äôre racing to 60 I‚Äôd just do whatever you feel like and you‚Äôll level off of it eventually. There‚Äôs no pressure to do all quests, just some specific quests that are important for X reason, such as PvP items, keys, attunes
---
Ghost mushrooms are closer to 4g on my server and Black Dragonscale have gone to over 1.5g each.

---
It probably isn't.
---
Yeah, and when people are on the toilet, pooping furiously, they'll hear that line in their heads.
---
From an RP perspective, I always assumed you had more of a conversation with them if they knew your name.
---
I don't know about you, but I introduce myself with a name.
---
Yeah the 60% mount looks so awesome.
---
Try it.
---
Go to the far right corner in the chapel, into one of these side cloisters, then click the clickable thing.
---
Is this on twitch ?
---
This title gave me stage 2 cancer.
---
Way too hard to control I think. You‚Äôd probably want 3 mage dps. I multibox just 2 of different classes and anything that doesn‚Äôt go according to plan is overwhelming and it‚Äôs difficult to recover.
---
Also look at the logistics in detail before you start. For example, blizzard is hard to use when multi boxing unless you broadcast mouse position to each mage which then might lead to other problems with accidental clicks
---
"WTF, Heals?"

All I really changed was the unit frames with Luna Unit Frames. I only bothered to do that much because I'm fucking blind and can't see the default ones. lol  
---
I wish I could make the action bars smaller and have a nice sleek UI but I really can't see shit if I make them any smaller.
---
That'd be no good seeing as how no one knows the legions he commands.
---
&gt;Its not VC Okay?
---
Downvoted because of that. You can argue that DM is Deadmines and be right, but that gives you no say over whether calling it VC is wrong. By now, everyone knows VC/DM are both Deadmines, so there‚Äôll be no confusion when it‚Äôs called either except by people trolling.
---
On my server, it was called VC. I didn‚Äôt vote on it, it did not make sense to me, but nevertheless, Bleeding Hollow called it VC so I rolled with it. I‚Äôll call it DM on my new server but I‚Äôm not gonna lose my shit if someone calls it VC - you know what that person means, I know what that person means, so there‚Äôs no reason for all of this.
---
Also not wearing fire resist for the entire raid and hence doing more dps than we did back then.
---
I am multiboxing in Classic. Lv32 right now and rolling with: 
---
Warrior - tank
---
Paladin - healer
---
Priest (shadow) + off-heal
---
Mage (frost)
---
Warlock (specced improves imp stamina + stronger dots + rest in destruction tree for shadow bolt dps)
---
So far this comp is very smooth in dungeons. I have strong dots with both warlock and priest. I have CC for almost everything and can dispel magic, poisons, diseases etc! And all the extra buffs I get with this comp is a very nice extra feature.
---
This is awesome, lol.  I‚Äôd invite.
---
Yeah that's true about the wow expansions. Some people will definitely want to keep vanilla. But you could say the same thing about Classic+. If you force the new content to everyone, then it's no longer vanilla. People who want pure vanilla won't be happy with that either.
---
Both tooltips say "Vendor 25c" tho
---
Whenever I see a mage go full mongoloid blizzard on 2 mobs I refuse to pull more because I know for a fact they're gonna go hard the second I start the pull and take 2/3 of mobs off me and cause a wipe cause now the healer has to heal 4 people instead of one. If they at least wait for me to gather threat before opening up then I'll happily pull more because I won't lose as many mobs and it will be significantly easier to regather anything that peels.
---
/cry
---
i think you mean ‚Äúcared‚Äù. it‚Äôs a 15 year old game.
---
Well, you‚Äôre wrong on a couple of points.
---
1. Obviously the OT should be second in threat, but pretty much every other strategy is to have a tank hover around 7-8 on the threat meter to be near the top after other folks lose threat to fireball.
---
2. It‚Äôs not an exploit in her targeting, the targeting has never been random. It is based on her threat table. If there is a bug it would be that having someone stacked on you causes the fireball not to reduce threat, but that may not even be a bug. 
---
3. That‚Äôs not really much of a solution. ‚ÄúThe best way to get threat is generate threat.‚Äù Well yeah, obviously. The issue is that even with having everyone autoattack and drop threat in p1 she is still difficult to pick back up in P3, because fireballs have reduced tank threat to basically 0.
---
I‚Äôve gone into P3 with a full rage bar, DW prot popping recklessness and a rage potion and she‚Äôs still killed 4-5 people and wrecked 75% of the raid with a breath before I got aggro. You are basically starting at 0 threat when people with no threat reduction could be at thousands on her threat table.
---
‚ÄúTake it slow‚Äù just isn‚Äôt helpful, everyone takes it slow and without some type of strategy will still have issues in P3.
---
Well yeah, thats what BiS means...
---
wot
---
I cycled through many many casters during my arena farm. I think 18 of them got their belt before I got my chest. Fortunately I did that shit during the iniitial frienzy so it took all of 30 seconds to fill slots as people leave.
---
looks great
---
You can only fight mages in dungeons for aggro so long.  This "trash matters more so AOE everything" nonsense is getting old.  I don't want to clear the dungeon 5 minutes faster when the planets align.  I want to clear the dungeon with 0 deaths.  And if going a little slower and focusing targets down accomplishes that goal, great.
---
I'm tired of AoE mages thinking they are contributing to the run when all they are doing is draining my mana and turning a relaxing game into a chore.
---
Where's all your totems. And you're abilities are all over the place D:
---
Ya most PUGs have their MT/OT already so I might just stick with DPS from here out. I have like 75% gear from either spec
---
This is one of the best parts of classic, if all I have is 30 mins to play at 60 I‚Äôm going to make the most of it. And murder lower lvl horde. Very satisfying
---
I've been playing like this for 15 years, I'm used to it. I mostly use nameplates and i have a WA that mimics the retail hp display in the middle under your character that shows up in combat.
---
The mushroom jesus cross
---
I'm sorry you had to deal with that :( bad mages are dime a dozen but tanking for an efficient squad is really good exp an hour and pretty low stress once you adjust expectations.
---
If your mages don't breathe through their mouths they will anticipate pulling the minions off you and trade nova, ice block, and cold snap cooldowns so the healer will not be strained. The tank's job is just to pull and generate threat initially, save taunts for mobs that go on healer or stray too far from the clump, and then Chase runners so they don't pull additional packs.
---
If you get grouped with mages that just like to AoE for the big meter numbers but don't do any of the other stuff to support that playstyle just kick and ignore cause you definitely don't want to have to group with them later during prebis grind, and you certainly don't want them in your guild taking raid drops from people who aren't mouthbreathers
---
At all of all gear possible I have higher agility, higher ap, hit cap, and bis enchants if my stats went up from pre raid bis and there isnt more gear than that in the game youre just trolling lmao
---
Why do you keep saying ‚Äúho boy‚Äù had to stop reading half way in fear of having to read those two words again.
---
Guess he was running up the wall from last boss und just slided down with slow fall ability.
---
Trolls be trollin'
---
You can check out BarTender4 for changing up your action bars. It's very easy to use, just turn off the art bar and change the spacing on the bars. You can scale the button size up or down as you please. Saves a lot of screen real estate!
---
Frost doesn't have to make Reddit posts for attention.
---
I like this photo
---
...You know you can have characters on different factions
---
How hard do you find dealing with 5 different characters? And is it fun to micro all of them around?
---
Well, I don't want to outright tell you, because you're doubting it and I think it'd be more fun if you to find out for yourself, especially since he has an NA server in Classic named after him.
---
If you still can't be bothered to google this for yourself, say so and I'll just fucking tell you.
---
Why farm those elementals? Why not the ones in searing gorge or any other higher level zone?
---
Lucky son of a... lol i don't think I've ever seen that recipe go below 200g on mine.
---
What's a 'WA'?
---
Warriors are awful at world pvp, which is the only pvp available atm
---
Just get bagon and titanpanel classic, it'll put your gold at the top and show ALL of your gold across characters. Very unintrusive addons - it'll take 1 minute to install and save you all this frustration.
---
Leveling isnt problem.. iam playing 31 shadow 20 disc... but i thought about this build for PvP...
---
Ill try 32/19 disc/holy for holy damage later
---
Definitely has been VC since Vanilla
---
Do people really mix up "trust" and "just"? Or are we missing a "take" in there?
---
I'll probably get the lock mount. Keep the gold on hand now and get the 900g mount in time for phase 3.
---
I think it's just a weird higher-level player power fantasy. As a Horde on a PvP server (Anathema) I see this behavior from alliance as well. It's rare when I get to fight someone my own level (30) because we're just trying to grind this shit out. But when a higher level person is around TM they just go for the people leveling. It's true for anywhere, not just Tarren Mill. 
---
The equal level players always want to leave each other alone because they know that the other one is trying to level. 
---
My solution to this: I never world pvp anyone, if I can help it. I fear the shit they're fighting. Over and over and over again. They kill me? No problem, I'll just run back and start fearing their shit again. Until I get bored.
---
"Tyrion comes in and fucks shit up."
---
That is pretty much Tyrion's entire career.
---
*Let's see if it pays off for him.*
---
Yes, Deadmines IS VC. It always was, always has been for this exact reason. 
---
Call it VC or DMS and there won't be any issues.
---
You're either retarded, trolling, or are absolute gutter trash at PvP who only plays with/against other gutter trash.
---
BGS aren't coming for quite some time.  Unless you are looking for a competetive edge in world pvp/ gank fiesta.
---
Okay. I agree, SM is better than Deadmines. What does that have to do with anything? Are Horde supposed to realize how important SM is to you and let you run by?
---
mna i dont know what to do at all. i feel like shit in pvp. i switched to subt but im really bad at this stunlock shit that other people do. I know theres someway that people cheese an extra combo point from sap? 
---
Not to mention switching to subt feels like i do shit all against mobs when soloing even at 60.
---
God i hate being bad. Rogue is hard at pvp.
---
It doesn't last super long, though. If you can kite with slows, roots, and stuns, you can drop it once it starts stacking high.
---
There's also that ledge nearby you can use, although it'll involve LoSing your healer around a pillar I think.
---
Warrior PoV regarding buffs and why it is an issue:
---
1-8 = Enchants
---
9 = Paladin Aura
---
10 = Priest Fortitude
---
11 = Druid MotW
---
12 = Hunter Aura
---
13 - 16 = Paladin Blessings
---
17 = MH Weapon Stone
---
18 = OH Weapon Stone
---
19 = Food buff
---
20 = Elixir of the Mongoose
---
21 = AP Juju
---
22 = Strength Juju
---
23 = 1 X-Potion (Rage pot, FAP, Resto Potion, Protection Potion)
---
24 = Bloodthirst (Warrior talent)
---
25 = Flurry (Warrior talent)
---
26 = Crusader proc
---
27 = Crusader proc
---
28 = Bloodrage (Warrior spell)
---
29 = Berserker Rage (Warrior spell)
---
30 = Furious Howl (Hunter pet spell)
---
31 = Songflower buff
---
32 = Onyxia buff
---
Wrote these up pretty quickly so maybe i have messed one or two up, but the end result will still be the same.
---
Ok so now we are buffcapped. This means in order to keep our buffs now, we cannot receive any healing buffs (Renews, shields, inspiration (priest healing talent). We cannot even bandage ourselves. This list only consists of 4 standard DPS consumes along with 2 weapon stones and 1 slot reserved for potion usage. In my eyes this is the bare minimum, so we are not talking autism minmax pushing 15+ extra consumes and losing buffs.
---
God forbid if anyone buffs you with anything out of the list such as spirit, thorns, intellect and so on.
---
From what I remember, you need 9% hit for 300 weapon skill. 6% hit for 305 weapon skill.
---
I'm not, except for when some no-life is taking an hour to spawncamp me. If you're not miserable when you're trying to quest and you're getting spawncamped by someone 10+ levels higher than you... you're lying.
---
&gt;It's on the mage to let us all know if they want me to pull bigger groups
---
The size of the pull and the pace which you pull at is determined by how well the tank can survive and hold threat, while also balancing how much mana the healer can retain during a pull. Dps should not be shot calling this, you should be able to determine what pace the group can handle as a tank, and if you cant then you need to ask the healer what they're comfortable with.
---
This is why I loved playing resto druid in BC and onward when they became full hotbots. Just load everyone up with hots, then the tank can go and do as they please while I drink and watch porn or something
---
Easier to kill,  more condensed moves,  less chance of being ganked, ect.
---
&gt;	felt the absence of fire
---
I‚Äôll have you know! Farming burning elementals in Arathi was a bitch for that reason! Only after many deaths was I able to optimize my strategy! But they fell all the same, as the cones of colds and arcane missiles will attest
---
... you're supposed to wait until he gets someone before saying he's trolling. Though I would peg this effort as a 25% chance to get someone.
---
Okay, SM is an important instance.
---
What does that change? I didnt design the geography of the game, nor did I try to claim it was fair.
---
I try to keep most mobs I kill on my level or a few levels below.   
---
I stayed in barrens and just grinded for a few hours earlier to keep my quest on my level.   
---
Have moved a bit between ashenvale and thousand needles now to keep quests at a good level or I believe I‚Äôll die a lot.
---
Yes please!  
---
Any way we could also get rid of the constant Rogue Distraction posts?
---
You are describing how a shadowpriest plays.
---
They don't have big dps.  They beat people in duels by being tankier and effectively denying the opponent the ability to do anything while they die.  Fear plus mindflay keeps warriors and rogues at bay.  Silence and mana burn destroys casters.  The healing from Vampiric Embrace isn't nothing and will make a difference for a full shadow priest.
---
And you still have your heals.  Nothing more tide turning than the shadow priest dropping shadowform and healing his buddy to full.  You can bubble and dispel as shadow.
---
Also, running as shadow, people won't rely on you for heals but will love you when you throw the occasional one.  As a disc priest, seeing an enemy shadow priest makes me more nervous than seeing an enemy healer.  I can deal with the healer.  I can't effectively deal with the spriest.
---
TIL about the VC/DM conflict.
---
Very helpful man, thank you.
---
Upside down crucified was actually St. Peter and not Jesus. Hope this helps!
---
I hope he never upgrades a single piece. True legend.
---
&gt; What does that have to do with anything?
---
...that lowbie Hordes *don't* have the same experience, because Deadmines isn't the clear best place for them to be leveling for 15+ levels?
---
...the point is that Horde has a significant advantage from the way the map is laid out?
---
Yea i buy them and save the leftover ones for this purpose for future runs.
---
Nah it requires the Tiger riding skill. As a human you need exalted with Darnassus to learn Tiger riding, added a whole extra layer of pain to this :P
---
6 manning Jed / Rend, reck comes back up around the time we start our 2nd run, if it's slow. If we get an instant Jed I won't have it up for run 2 on Pyroguard. Threat problems, so can't pop it on Rend / Gyth.
---
I'll look into it, thanks!
---
Ehh. On Skullflame there's usually a group of people chilling outside the dungeon LFG.
---
Been leveling with my wife, she plays lock so i went fire so she could get 15% more damage on half her spells. Also nothing feels better than killing mobs before they get to you with no need for the frost novas.
---
Our strategy has been bear tank MT (me).In P3 everyone pops LIP, the bear pops MCP, and within  6 seconds I‚Äôm so far ahead no one is catching me.
---
The mob AI is so bad they stand still for a solid 2 seconds after being out of range to melee. More than enough time for a regrowth. Also I don't know a single trash mob (susceptible to nova/war stomp) that can 1 shot melee
---
There is a douche bag on my realm named USSAzzPounder. Been reported many times, yet the name still exists.
---
tomorrow! yeah!
---
well, i'm only 44 now, so tomorrow + another month or so of enjoying this leveling grind :-D
---
The buttons in gnomergan... I‚Äôve played this god damn game since 2004 and just learned about them yesterday... last boss when a face turns green hit the button and it clears the bombs.
---
Last night I went to turn in a quest to Thrall which was going to ding me 60.  Not only did Thrall personally give me his blessing unto 60 but someone turned in an Onyxia head right after which made turning 60 super epic.
---
It‚Äôs a quote from The Simpson‚Äôs.
---
Don't forget good old fairy fire!
---
Am 57 healer, what level am I good to do LBRS, UBRS, Scholo, and Strath
---
Yeah there isn‚Äôt one. At first there was these cool 100% mounts that were different colors and had no armor like this tiger is available for every race and mount type but blizzard decided to keep these out of classic for some dumb reasoning?
---
It was absolutely not called VC since the start lmao
---
Before the slowfall......hes literally skipping along the vertical surface before he even activates it. 
---
Its not wall jumping either as it can't be done in classic, it was removed in the modern client. Interview with wow developer confirming that here:
---
 [https://www.wowhead.com/news=288412/blizzcon-2018-wow-classic-interview-with-brian-birmingham-and-john-hight](https://www.wowhead.com/news=288412/blizzcon-2018-wow-classic-interview-with-brian-birmingham-and-john-hight)
---
Well yes, but actually no.
---
More importantly some QoL changes the game dynamics in other areas (social ones), like LFD and servers merging together.
---
Making soul shards stack isn't going to hurt anyone. Its just going to help warlocks have space. Shit, we can cap a warlock at 25 shards and make them stack in 10s or something, so it doesn't alter what they're capable of but makes it hurt less.
---
Druids not having a regular rez is also weird and terrible.
---
Shamans needing to carry around totems, too.
---
There are other things but you see where i'm going here.
---
They are still trying to get all the realms down to one layer, so probably consolidation on some of them. But even if that's not, there's like a dozen other explanations to go to before defaulting to nefarious manipulations
---
Whoosh!
---
...and is also chock full of things that did make it into the final game, like training
---
If you create a country were say, kicking little kids as an adult was allowed, would you go "go kick them little kids"? Cause just cause it's allowed doesn't mean it doesn't make you a dickbag.
---
I mean.... NOW they'll look for it.
---
Im thinking as a 60 you can skip almost all of this and just get to the scorpids, seems easy enough if you can solo the 10 scorpids. Mage prob has it the easiest. Im thinking for my lock ill do VW sac and hellfire
---
The first one of these I saw posted was riddled with people just giving OP and it was just awful.
---
you can make a macro that fixes the aura issue
---
This. Had a mage take Luminary kilt from my shaman by needing before even realizing it wasn't cloth...
---
Nothing you said has anything to do with my comment...
---
This is a trick that just gets you killed. There is no quest.
---
Classic seems to be particularly toxic unfortunately.
---
LFM D!! Need healer
---
15 goddamn years later and the pieces finally fall into place...
---
He will still switch targets, but no sleep means it's easy to get his attention back.
---
The quest is called "Gullible idiots die when they attempt this"
---
Yup. One day my Mortal Strike macro will stop being a red question mark.
---
...assuming I stop making alts
---
We life tap between fights because we can self heal pretty quickly. If we pull agro that becomes an issue, otherwise we‚Äôre essentially immortal. Drain Life (if in aff spec) yields 120% of life drained back to caster, so 1  LT and DL is a net positive health.
---
I'm with this ESPN this one, there is no FUCKING way I can play with the middle of my screen clogged up with nameplates.
---
Its unnatural, it blocks shit in view around your character and it weights your UI to the bottom of the screen.
---
There is also a Imp Sprint build that looks something like this. It was popular on private servers for a while. It is especially good versus mages, if you find yourself struggling there.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fheboxkZhj00bZV0ec
---
The big downsides are you cannot do the silly 1v1 combo ccc chain without prep and you can always just use a free action potion vs mages to get a free win anyways, but it does have it's upsides and the playstyle feels more fast paced instead of feeling like you're always just standing around waiting for a restealth or energy ticks.
---
I'm just glad someone actually equipped vendor strike tbh
---
i'm also 31/20 arms/fury and tanking BRS/strat/scholo at will. i do use sword spec and tank with  swords. as soon as i'm done running through all the quests in epl and winterspring i'm going deep prot 11-5-35 and tanking in earnest.
---
Shhh, the masses aren't supposed to know about this.

you gotta do better than that
---
Rogues are fun though! Plus in MC they are really good DPS. Stay strong
---
I switched to fury/arms dual wield raid dps spec immediately after hitting 60 and have had no problems tanking dungeons.
---
If you make a warrior, don't level as prot. You can tank everything jus fine as arms. I made the switch to prot at lvl 55 to tank the deeper sections of BRD more comfortably. Dungeons can also burn you out pretty quickly in my opinion, so leveling as arms gives you the opportunity to sprinkle in some questing when you don't feel like running a dungeon for the tenth time.
---
2 hand tanking makes 0 sense for paladins anyways.

It's hardly relevant to classic, I just enjoy telling this story.
---
In Cataclysm, you needed a minimum of 1600 arena rating to qualify for purchasing certain PvP pieces. I had a feral druid friend who was just awful at PvP. Keyboarding turning, clicking skills, the whole nine. But he wanted to get to 1600 rating. So I told him I would carry him.
---
On my Blood DK, I would have him stealth and hide from the start of the fight, and I would 2v1 until I managed to get someone low enough for him to kill within an opener.
---
We made it to just over 1800 before he got bored and didn't want to do it anymore.
---
I was having a blast.
---
The present tense form of the past perfect ‚Äúyote‚Äù or the pluperfect ‚Äúhad yought‚Äù.
---
I'm going to start playing again for the 1st time in like 10 years. What are some tips for someone that has pretty much forgotten everything about the game?
---
Pink for points...
---
I life tap between pulls and I will eat til the tank engages. If I am missing anymore health then I'll just naturally regen it anyway. 
---
TBH, I'd generally recommend not healing me on a lock unless I'm below 50%, depending on the fight and such.
---
The only time PvP servers don't suck is during phase 2 in specified areas, like Tarren Mill v Southshore, Splintertree v Astranaar, any other raids where both sides have leveling hubs nearby, and capital city raids. The first set because they have large groups of players near your level on each side, as well as a bunch of 60s on each side and some players in between.  They become a huge m√©l√©e in between, with both sides constantly gaining and losing territory as the battle lines adjust, reinforcements arrive, etc. They're structured and unstructured at the same time. Sure you get pulverized, but it's a big party without any rules instead of a head-to-head face off with you against a guy +10 your level. Capital raids are the same sort of frenetic, adrenaline-pumping race against the clock where you're trying to make it to the leader before reinforcements show up *en masse*. 
---
The other 90% of PvP servers blows. Fortunately I've been behind the curve for the last 2-3 weeks so I haven't been ganked since I was level 20.
---
This character is my first time playing WoW. Don't really know what I'm doing, haha.
---
Stop making posts about this. People are still going to call it VC. Get over it.
---
Paladins have another out, you can BoP the tank to drop the stacks, though they'd need to quickly cancel it straight after otherwise they'll rampage on the dps.
---
It's the Westfall equivalent to Barrens chat.
---
I didn't replace that dagger until LBRS, it was ridiculous.
---
Fury warrior:
---
If you're not an orc, you want thrash blade + mirahs song and edgemasters (or human racial) until you get Dal'Rends, Dal'Rends has good enough stats and raw dps to outmatch them.
---
Thrash blade is an insane one hand, not only does it proc of all main hand attacks (white + yellows), it also proccs of sunder armor and disarm, basically anything that requires a weapon to use, which means this weapon procs a lot.
---
Oh yeah I have a couple on my "dumbass dps" list that I'm going to refuse to group with ever again. Also 1 hunter.
---
I know. If only it was 3v1, then it would at least be even odds.
---
Yes I‚Äôm a warrior.
---
Yes I‚Äôm leveling as Fury.
---
YES WE EXIST.
---
*Dual Wield Lives Matter*
---
Yep, I can get home work, log in, and being walking through the portal within 15. I don't know why the tanks whine about that.
---
I don't really understand the two camps that exist in this thread, as if SS -&gt; WW and using a shield are mutually exclusive.
---
My ST pulls go like this: Mark kill target, with a 2h equipped Charge -&gt; SS (bloodrage if needed) -&gt; WW -&gt; Defensive stance / equip shield, sunder / taunt as needed and pop my WW+2h macro whenever the cooldown is up. We don't use CC.
---
I have my shield out for 80% of the fight, throw down enough threat on all mobs with the initial WW so the healer doesn't pull and the pace of the dungeon is much faster. Going into defensive immediately after a charge to tab-target sunders is a much less rage-efficient way to generate threat in my experience so far. You could argue that you should be marking targets for CC, but that's slow and nobody in my group wants to do that.
---
This spec is a sure fire way to constantly get your ass whuped.
---
Post these more often, Zelden :D
---
In BFD you can skip the platform jumps in the beginning. The rocks that block your path actually hides a perfect path to walk through. 
---
This is still in retail too.
---
transparency is one thing but this is another level
---
Haha. Well if you do more instances than I did, you'd look a lot better.
---
You would think that would be the first category.
---
I‚Äôve been having this happen the last few days as well with no fix yet. Both on classic and retail though. It will completely freeze and I‚Äôll have no choice but to force restart my computer. Kind of irritating and I‚Äôve never had it happen like this before.
---
yes that would probably be the best way to do it as a warlock, still i think you\`ll have to kill the golem at the start.
---
Should be able to do all of them. Note that mobs do increased damage compared to previous instances but you should be just fine. From my experience, people are more picky on the level for strat but it should still be doable at 57.
---
UBRS could be the hardest to find a group (usually lvl 60 farm it) but as a healer you should be able to get in at least some groups
---
Can you give us the specs for your computer? Is it a laptop, or a desktop?
---
In a plane, the farther away you are from the front the less chances of dying in a plane crash. Same logic here. Which means wow = real world which means if I play wow all dat, I actually have a life. Detective skills over 9000
---
I haven't really used leatherworking for profit, but it's nice to make hunter and rogue armor to not buy those or be dependant on dungeons. Feels like hardly any agility gear in dungeons.
---
Well, CoC + Arcane Explosion spam is obviously going to beat Blizzard's damage. How's your mana tho?
---
Do you have a sauce with the correct mats?  I would have likely referred to something inaccurate.
---
If you're just in it for cash, going dual gathering is the way to go. Skinning plus either Herbalism or Mining, since you can only have one tracking skill active.
---
Back in vanilla I was able to afford all of my skills, mounts, and new AH gear every 5 or so levels.
---
Im also amused by the lack of saying what gear or stats or just showing that you have any actual "understanding" of your class you just sound dumb.
---
Yeh. I mostly did questing.
---
Edit - actually, looking at the video, I think it changes around level 40ish.
---
Requires Berserker Stance to use though, and most tanks are not going to be chilling in Berserker Stance on trash pulls.
---
except the amount of damage you directly take is a massive difference. its not comparing apples to apples. mana isn't an issue if you're getting 2 shot. he's not arguing about SPEC hes saying put on a damn shield. You're completely missing the point
---
Sunmit a bug and wait for it to be fixed
---
I posted a walk through of a custom guild/loot tracking app I built, and it got removed for low effort content. I looked at the front page and 15 of the top 25 were shitty thex memes. The content and mods on this sub are low quality.
---
It is. It's going to be the spec everyone switches to post MC. It scales significantly better and has more consistent single target DPS. 
---
Arcane Frost specifically requires a mage cutting his DPS for the group to do more. Arcane fire has every mage making more use of their cooldowns and procs. 
---
Elemental is beautiful but really Mana hungry and not really the best for dungeons/raids, but great for PvP. It becomes much nicer when everything isn't fire immune. 
---
For anything but end game comment any spec that allocates all your points is viable. 
---
As someone with a 50g Respec and did Aoe, PvP, fire, ele, arcane at pretty much every dungeon.
---
I would gladly level a second priest and heal these for people might be worth it.
---
Why were you running deadmines after level 32?
---
Now that i think about it, Executus it's a perfect name for a cat.
---
\*Cat meows constantly for dinner\*
---
TOO SOON EXECUTUS.
---
&gt;People didn't just randomly select ONE dungeon to be named after the boss
---
Actually, that's exactly what happened.
---
Best in Slot, Worst In Show
---
The epic undead Warhorses are some of the coolest mounts they ever put in the game. I guess the Legion Karazhan horse is the closest thing we'll ever get to an updated model, and that looks rad as hell too.

Man r. I. P heath ledger...

Maybe because it's the 12th time seeing this type of post and it's not even a server first

&gt; +healing through greens/blues.
---
*cries in warlock*
---
i was full shadow until 60, had no issue healing with a competent group.
---
i also don't think anybody expects warriors to spec prot as leveling, however, OP is only asking for them to put on a shield
---
Can someone explain the wording of blessing of sanctuary to me? The skill reads as if it reduces my own damage output, but I heard people say it reduces damage taken (which would make more sense). If the latter is the case then why doesn't the skill just read "reduces damage taken by xx"?
---
I‚Äôm 31/20. Got  all healing talents in holy, skipped str, imp seal of righteousness, didn‚Äôt get stun/fear reduction, and only put 2 points in improved seal of light, got block + imp block, kings and imp righteous fury. Tanking 5 mans is np, I use wisdom in UD Strat/ scholo and righteous for initial threat in others and don‚Äôt have to respec for raid healing
---
At 60, a 20/0/31 build has a lot of help with mana.  If you jumped straight to shadow at 40, you'll struggle until you hit meditation and then a few points into mental agility.
---
If you are wanting to be a battle healer, you are better off as disc when leveling.  Mana burn, higher regen, bigger bubbles, better fort.  You'll be well placed to be an offensive priest, dispelling, dotting, burning, and then still having plenty of mana to heal.
---
You're free to run dungeons your own way but you should advertise as such so someone doesnt run all the way to the dungeon just to get kicked when zoning in :[
---
Sure you make money, but they are both pretty slow imo
---
I'd suggest a friend that wants to play the game more lol
---
This is fantasy though, and we routinely murder each other for fun in ways that don't correspond at all to the real world so it's not really the same at all. All PVP deaths give grief. The solution here is to rally your own faction's level 60's to come teach a lesson, not to complain that you got PVP'd at an inconvenient time on a PVP server.
---
It's weird that you thought about this for pvp.... this build is similar to what the poor sap that has to stack shadow weaving for the locks would have to run.
---
Edit: Want PvP? Go full shadow with some disc and stack stamina like crazy.
---
Exactly what I did, but much too late. I tried so find out if it was a local problem first. Knowing that in hindsight is probably the worst part for me. Lessons learned though!
---
OP this is entirely your fault for not being able to communicate properly. You think so much is expected of you and have so many expectations for people without even talking about it. As a tank you signed up for the possibility of shitty groups. But you know what? If you don't want to raid lead say that you're unwilling to do so. If you can't mark and the raid leader is taking forever? You can leave, it's within your right to do so, you don't need to let people waste your time. Be patient, but not too patient. 
---
Also get used to having mages sheep before you pull. 
---
Oh and try pulling while people are drinking, your mages and healers don't need 100% mana for every pull. 
---
If the shaman is enhance healing and youre dying, straight up leave.

Warrior is herb/alch. Make some money on herbs I‚Äôm done with or the odd pots used for leveling but not used but I‚Äôm not paying for health pots either. Fishing makes a little. Cloth after I‚Äôve pushed through that type for first aid... hunter alt sits in storm wind and de‚Äôs anything that the mats are worth more than I can sell it for on the AH or vendor. Druid alt that I‚Äôm playing as a break from the warrior grind is herb/mining and is filthy rich. Once he is 60 I‚Äôll drop herb on the warrior and power level engineering. If tbc comes out I‚Äôll level the Druid to 70 first to be a life blooming tree god.

Is there an AddOn that shows if rares are spawned when you enter an area? I want to farm Tidal Charm and it's a pain

Yeh! I really wish I had taken one at the start in that same position (although there was a million people there on launch day). I thought about making a level 1 priest that looks the same just to do that but.. I'm lazy.

&lt;Impulse to Run&gt; Benediction Horde 
---
We are a small group of guildies and friends that raided together in the top vanilla horde guild on Daggerspine back in the day. We are mostly in our 30s now so we are looking for like minded people that are chill and are interested mostly in raiding and 5 mans. Right now most of our members are lvl 25-45ish. We all have jobs and families so we aren‚Äôt no lifing as hard as some and that‚Äôs fine.
---
We are looking for any classes right now, experience isn‚Äôt absolutely necessary so long as you‚Äôre willing to learn and be part of the guild.
---
We are also open to guild merges if you have a smaller guild and you want to join up let us know! We have a core group that is on most nights running dungeons.
---
Send me a tell in game or Revidy#1346 if interested. Thanks
---
Is this the troll? If so I'll pay the troll toll.
---
That's a miserable one. There's also one by the Wyverns iirc.
---
The highest buyable bag has 16 slots, which is easily worth it.
---
I think Shaman would be rough for Spriest.
---
Good thing I'm Horde!
---
Much lower chance is not the same as absolutely no chance. You still have the potential to outplay your opponent. People assume that pvp is all automated and x should never beat y but in reality thats not how pvp works unless the players are at a very even skill level. You probably wont win vs a good mage but you can still outplay an average mage as combat.
---
I'd only be OK with the "dps on boss is what matters"  during raid progression.
---
Otherwise, if you analyze it, you're spending 80% of the time in a dungeon fighting trash, not bosses, so it makes perfect sense to optimize for the 80% and not the 20% which isn't going to wipe you anyways.
---
Ho boy...
---
I'm starting to believe that most people on this sub are *really* bad at this game. Not that its a problem, gotta start somewhere, but the way this sub always complains about mages, tanking, etc. is ridiculous. 
---
Probably just a bad sample of data though: Get a bad group, waste a few hours, come to reddit to blow off steam. Get an average or better group, you're playing the game an enjoying it and not whining about shit on reddit.
---
But you're right -- tanking isn't that difficult. This game as a whole isn't that difficult, mechanically speaking.

better for a holy priest?
---
So, for me and my friends, it's a directional thing. If you're throwing something, you're *yeeting* that bitch. Or, if something is traveling away, said object is being *yeeted* e.g. bodies flying away, casting shadow-bolt on that pesky, 1% hp gnome while shouting "YEET" etc. Yoinking, on the other other hand, is something traveling towards you. So... deathgrip on the DK's in retail? Fuckin' *yoinkin'* bitches. When I was running m+ on retail and had a dumbass melee standing in shit? *yoink* that hoe with lifegrip on my priest.
---
That isn't even close to being a fair analogy. So dumb.
---
Finally some good warrior advice on here. It‚Äôs been so bad lately. This is the build this guy is looking for.
---
What i'm saying is that your view is based on a single character (mages having to use their entire power pool), which isn't wrong but its not big enough. Whenever you've got a group you need to tailor how you play (a bit) to the group as a whole. If you have a group with a rogue, mage, and hunter, you get tons of CC and can burn through mobs 1 at a time (but very quickly). I'm talking "kill it before taunt wears off in 6 seconds". If you have no CC whatsoever then you aoe explode shit and split DPS to kill everything at once, etc.
---
Thats all.
---
This is not the troll you are looking for.
---
You mean I've been carrying a fat stack this whole time?
---
No, they named it after Dire maul was out obviously.
---
Maybe if you're a Human, but otherwise probably not.  Flurry is half the extra hits on a proc, but it procs twice as often per minute.  Flurry axe makes your mainhand swing an additional time, so it scales with your mainhand's damage (and thus the rage it generates)  
---
You're going to have more trouble replacing it than you will with Ironfoe, especially if you're an Orc.
---
As a Lock who regularly life-taps her health into oblivion, I feel this.
---
I can't speak for any other games but yesterday classic was running absolutely perfectly so I don't know what changed from then and now like 10 hours later
---
Download some add-ons, play what is fun for you. The rest is filler.

More of a revenge moment, but BRM on Stalaag is always camped by a lot of horde. Trying to dodge the horde raid I jumped into the lava at the bottom, only to be stunned by a rogue at the exit ramp and killed. Once I got back to my body I waited for the rogue to open on some one else. Being a priest I waited for my opportunity. Once he opened, I resurrected and feared forcing his will of the forsaken, once that was gone I mind controlled him and held him under the lava until he died. Following his demise horde were jumping down 1 at a time and the next 7-8 horde received the same treatment as the rogue until  it was time to run into BRD.
---
Haha i did notice my character was... precariously placed we'll say... between those large stone thighs haha
---
Makes sense. That story sounds epic. I'm guessing you didn't end up killing the boss?
---
Albion Online is a current MMO with full loot PVP.
---
Do piercing Ice and Ice shards damage amp apply to blizzard as well? For some reason I have this feeling it only applies to frost bold and front nova, etc. Also, does permafrost apply to blizzard on top of improved blizzard? Thx
---
I mean that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying. I‚Äôve have no issues with healing specced priest. At all. And earlier dungeons shadow healing was fine. But around 54+ the kids that tried healing as shadow were always kicked and replaced with a real healer. And everything went well. Also you can‚Äôt say 15% healing is or isn‚Äôt going to save someone at some point. That‚Äôs a little much. Because if it wasn‚Äôt going to save you then you might as well not get that talent :/
---
Recount, and thank you!
---
I remember when they originally buffed it there was outcry that it still sucked. :(
---
As someone who's tried to do the Redridge escort one too many times, I support this action.
---
Except some of these *noob murderers* don't kill you as you take the quest, they wait down by the bridge in-town and throttle your whole group just seconds before the quest would complete.
---
To many frost mages in the game freezing it up.
---
not all critters do it that I've seen but yah I believe it! Didn't know the ones in rfk did it too!
---
They still remove all of them lol. I wasn't insulting the level of Photoshop or anything. Just how the mods handle all memes like this. 
---
Screenshots: high effort
---
Photoshopped memes: low effort
---
If you are a priest doing spell cleave in SM Cath. You can MC the wizards and use their arcane torrent to get top dps without having to worry about healing
---
Tbh, that's only thing I miss about retail. I see how it could mess up balance in a sense, but as a warrior I would kill for dual spec.
---
I think the speed you go through them, at least when paired up with the music, is waaay too quick. I put your slowest to 0.25x speed on Youtube and that felt roughly right for the music.
---
Ha ha. "Take it Slow" really works best for me if I'm being honest. I like absorbing the stories, reading the quest text, exploring the game world, and I'm playing Alliance for the first time after 15 years of Retail Horde, so a lot of things are literally brand new for me. 
---
Plus, on the Real Life side, I need to make sure I keep enough time free for my side job, and I also can't guarantee that I'm not going to have to go do crap offline every few minutes with the playtime that I do have. I could have a few hours of time free to do dungeons, or I could be leaving every five minutes because people have to invent chores out of the blue.
---
Triggered alliance?
---
There's a deadzone in gadgetzan where the guards don't aggro, so long as he doesn't attack right as the pat walks past. This is not technically a terrain exploit, as he isn't making use of impossible pathing, but just straight guard dead zone. It sounds like he's occasionally messed it up and aggroed the guards, which proves it isn't a pathing exploit.
---
Technically not even a reportable offense, although I agree it's some straight bullshit.
---
Judgement of wisdom.
---
People that say DM referring to dire maul quickly realize their mistake when every whisper is asking ‚Äúwhat wing?‚Äù ‚ÄúTribute?‚Äù Etc. It‚Äôs not a problem. Dire Maul ads always have a wing attached.
---
I started playing late in Vanilla and never even played Dire Maul back then. I think I dinged 60 like two weeks before BC released. Back then someone in Westfall chastised me for calling Dead Mines, DM... so it's been VC to me ever since.
---
LMAOOOOO
---
I‚Äôve been part of a group that did ZG, for myself as part maybe 4 times back in 2006. So I‚Äôm familiar with the dungeon but don‚Äôt know any of the gear, don‚Äôt think I ever received anything from there tbh.
---
DPS race is gear + time spent grinding consumables. Not exactly "hard" compared to tanking, at least during the act.

I accidentally the whole thing!

And my axe!

&lt;Centrally Planned&gt; | Horde | Thalnos | 9:30-12:30 EST/6:30-9:30 PST (Tues/Thurs) | Semi-hardcore
---
Introduction: &lt;Centrally Planned&gt; was formed by a group of folks who met playing modern wow, enjoyed each other‚Äôs company, and found communist memes amusing (For real though we have a lot of liberals/leftists. You for sure don't have to be. But if you get triggered by the existence of the left, that might be an issue).
---
Raid Schedule: We will be raiding two nights a week 9:30-12:30 pm EST/6:30-9:30 pm PST on Tues and Thurs. Haven't fully decided between loot council and hybrid LC/DKP either way with focus on gearing tanks first.
---
Player Expectations: We are listed as semi-hardcore because we all have lives and know some accommodations must be made for that. The officer core is made up of people who are neither in high school nor unemployed with the ability to no-life and play 24/7. That said, we expect people to come prepared with consumables, arrive on time, and aim for 80%+ attendance.
---
The guild will be focused on the PvE content of the game but we are intentionally rolling on a PvP server as it is a pretty fun aspect of the game.
---
Recruiting:
---
&gt;Hunters
---
&gt;Mages
---
&gt;Priests
---
&gt;Shaman
---
&gt;Most things(DPS&gt;&gt;healers). Looking to round out the raid team. Could likely accommodate whatever (except we are flush with druids and tanks)
---
On Culture: &lt;Centrally Planned&gt; is centered around establishing a healthy and comical environment for those looking to progress through classic content with a semi-hardcore attitude focused on personal responsibility. We look to provide an inclusive atmosphere where homophobia, sexism, racism, and the like aren‚Äôt tolerated. You don‚Äôt need to have a bleeding heart, but if you can‚Äôt keep casual bigotry out of guild dealings, somewhere else would be a better fit.
---
If this sounds like a good fit, come say hey on our discord channel https://discord.gg/vmC5sMb
---
I mA dPs WaRrIoR 1: "I don't tank."
---
Well you are about to because that is literally how this fight works.
---
I mA dPs WaRrIoR 1: "I don't have a shield."
---
/kick, how about you are you up for tanking p3 Onyxia.
---
~~I mA dPs WaRrIoR 2~~I am a warrior: "Yep."
---
Done. The sad thing is that was an actual interaction.
---
Leveling my warrior has given me less than no respect for the I mA dPs WaRrIoR crowd. I immediately look down on any warrior in LFG that needs a tank while leveling. If you don't know how to tank a smooth dungeon with a 2h while leveling then odds are you don't know what 3/4 of your buttons do.
---
Battleshouts? Probably going to be dropping constantly, because that definitely isn't worthwhile for damage.
---
Pummel? Nah I like having to kill mobs twice.
---
Disarm? lol what is defensive stance, I am going to eat this enrage to my face.
---
Hamstring? I mean sure it is  crowded and we likely will have 10 mobs come...but it is okay because...
---
Shield wall? No silly big brain time retaliation!! I'll 1v20 them!...aww shoot I died after the first 5 hits. Stupid healer is oom from the previous pull I face tanked in zerker stance. If the healer had kept me alive we totally could have done it...oh the warrior tanking and the other 2 dps still managed to do it with an oom healer. Well for 2 seconds I did REALLY good DPS!!
---
Definitely not going to help protect the healer, demo shout, or thunderclap when they overpull...mostly because they are dead, but they very likely will have some inbred fueled rage about how everyone is garbage and that is why they died, it definitely wasn't their fault.
---
In all seriousness if you are leveling a warrior, learn to tank. Tank with a 2h, carry a shield, and you will find 1) it is far faster finding dungeon groups, 2) you deal far more damage then dpsing, 3) it actually is extremely fun and engaging, 4) you will get a nice big friends list of people who want to run dungeons with you, 5) it really will make you a better player, and understand how to utilize your less frequently used abilities better. It will make you a better pvper. It will make you a better 5 man dungeon spammer at 60. It will make you a better raider. Because it is easy to find warriors to top the DPS charts, almost any warrior can do that, unfortunately it is pretty apparent at this point MOST warriors probably don't know how to play a warrior outside of that. Or maybe it is simply that the other competent warriors are not out there going "I mA dPs WaRrIoR". 6) At 50 when you start running instance that actually require a shield, you will know what you are doing and you won't find it as scary, boring, or intimidating to do.
---
I‚Äôm not advocating anything here I agree playing on pvp means you‚Äôre gonna get ganked, these kids are just crying. But I am unsure the fantasy that magically 60s are going to come at some lowbies beckon. If you‚Äôre some random guy maybe couple friends in game this isn‚Äôt reality that you can just cry out and have players come help.
---
Thanks for this!  \*makes note to use Fear Ward tonight\*
---
A rogue tried ganking me while I turned in a quest at Duke hydraxis..... Tried....
---
this is classic wow or vanilla wow. X does beat Y. That is how pvp works, in mage duels, a pvp specced rogue with full cds should win almost every time, the duel is the rogues to lose. Combat rogues specced for pvp have a small chance to win ONLY because of improved sprint. I do 100% think a hemo rogue with one row of cds should win against a mage, but you are banking on a crit from an eviscerate and I would favor the mage in any duel against a swords rogue.
---
There is a very very clear reason why dagger rogue is favored highly in pvp. They have high burst, they have two full rows of cds, and their damage directly counters classes that subsequently give them the most trouble (warlocks, mages, priests) literally, one good ambush crit off their shield and they are dead or near dead.
---
Beating an average mage as a skilled combat rogue is sad overall, imagine trying your absolute best to beat a player who is considered average (which in a classic setting is low, seeing as how mages are the new braindead class)
---
I will say that the absolute best combination is learning how to weave ambushes and backstabs while also swapping to a slow MH to hemo for much harder hits overall depending on the situation. That is the most ideal setup to strive for as a pvp rogue in general.
---
You can extend this by healing ONCE while spamming drink and actually start drinking in combat. It takes a millisecond to bring you in combat and if your quick you start drinking.
---
Unbind backpedal LOL
---
I think it's because there were to many rogues made xD.
---
They need trash healers too xD Just any healers really.
---
Try playing horde on faerlina. Roaming groups of 5+ alliance in hillsbrad regularly ganking horde 10 levels below them, and I'm lucky if even 1 horde in zone chat has a decent enough guild to help out.
---
Now this is how Game of Thrones should have ended!
---
No I was specifically talking about wotf itself. Never did I say undead rogue or allude to being opened upon from stealth. You should take your own advice about building strawmen.
---
Yeah this has always been the problem, kind of silly that people think it's caused by anything other then people's self interest. It's not quite as bad in retail because people can tank queue, so they can run a lot of dungeons really fast, but it's still a problem.
---
Yeahh I got Superior Striking for 30g off someone in trade chat.. That I flipped for 150 lol. There's money to be made reselling if you can become familiar with pricing and spend time reading trade chat.
---
Bro that edit has no business being as good as it is wtf
---
What server? Skeram?
---
it doesn't save you, it makes you (the healer) more mana efficient
---
I don't know man, but I tried signing onto the server my friends are on yesterday and I was never able to get in. The whole time my place in line and my estimated time left kept increasing
---
???? nobody was saying you could
---
Maybe they have fun? What exactly are they wasting here?
---
I'm not sure that was ever a thing - I had the UBRS key as well in vanilla so lockpicking it might have been very very early WoW days before I hit 60 and started running it but it's been key only as long as I've been playing.
---
Ye I have not attacked a single alliance player during leveling and most of the alliance players at the same level have ignored me, but higher level alliance players always kill me even when I'm just sitting and drinking water beside 3 alliance dudes at my level who won't attack me
---
That's a weird way of spelling "Blizzard a bunch"
---
Haha that's good cause some nights I drink and get distracted lol
---
personally i just shove things onto my bars where i think they'll be ok and then get used to that set up
---
Kinda disappointed they didn't make the other one a priest
---
Different strokes for different folks, as long as you're enjoying the game then you're doing it right. MMOs are like crack for me so I just used PTO to get situated in the game and now I have a good balance in my life. OMG am I finally adulting?
---
Fuck, I feel this one.  Played a warrior for five years straight nine years ago.  Playing another one now, but the keybinds just feel *wrong*.  No idea how I had them set up before.
---
You can put your existing owl in the stables. Then go tame a new owl with higher ranks of claw and screech. Use the new owl until the spells appear in your pet spell book, then you teach it to your existing owl.
---
Drag from your bag onto your bar. That puts the 'Item' on the bar, dragging it from your character panel puts the 'Item Slot' on the bar.
---
I dunno. The Forsaken are pretty fucking evil in classic. Orcs/trolls/tauren, fine. But it's like non-undead horde &gt; alliance &gt; &gt; &gt; forsaken.
---
What? No just train the owl, learn the new abilities, and get your old owl out of the stable and train it. If it doesn't have a better attack speed (which I think all owls are 2.0?) then it has no other benefit. In fact, if anything it's a detriment, since you need to re-level its loyalty.
---
Could I ask what talents and equipment you're using for that?
---
Somehow expected you to grow during the video. Been watching too many pup to doggo vids, me thinks
---
Congrats on 60!

Not playing meta and attention seeking have been hand in hand with WoW since 2006,

Username doesn't check out.
---
He was just saying it's not technically an acronym. Just a little pedantry. No need to blow a gasket over it. 
---
Also, your examples are abbreviations, not acronyms.
---
You certainly don‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù those talent points, but they save you many, many wipes and many hours in dungeons doing shitty pulls. If you only play with guildies who know what they‚Äôre doing, by all means go full raid dps and tank in some tank gear, but if you don‚Äôt, you‚Äôll save yourself many headaches with 20 points in prot. 
---
Also, no one even really needs full dps talents in raids either.
---
You said "no issues", but there are unrealized issues.  It can be done, but it's much more efficient as holy.  That said, everything you do outside of dungeons becomes far more inefficient.  So, it's a balance as to what you want to do.
---
If he's standing on a building and doing it then that's actually something you can report, it's terrain manipulation.  Gadget is notorious for it.

Piercing ice does improve blizzard damage I'm quite sure. You just won't notice is since blizzard does 8 ticks of damage over 8 seconds.

Blizzard cant crit, any crit multipliers won't affect blizzard (ice shards)

YouTube series are amazingly popular on RuneScape/OSRS. I would highly recommend grabbing highlights from your series and making 10min videos that are really the good content chunks.

I‚Äôm pretty sure this is what wow content is missing. At least I am struggling to find progress vids of fun.

I'm in a small guild with some irl friends. So I pug most things. Trying to recruit some people as well
---
Some people might consider commandeering an npc brain to stare through its eyes a "hostile action".

Not sure if its a bug or working as intended, but opens up plenty of possibilities ^_^
---
Played in a FFXI guild that did this for years and we made a shit ton of money.
---
Our GM eventually RMT'd and got a fuckload of dollars... Raids were 18 people we'd bring 6 clients, never taking any loot from them, just money.
---
On my shaman I joined a ZF group as DPS (enhancement, two-hander, no shield or 1h available).
---
They forced me to tank and pulled like crazy while I was desperately trying to regen mana/hp. I kept telling them to slow down, that I am not a tank, and that I didn't choose this. They just ignored me and we wiped 3 times before I just left.
---
I understand that some groups can be really bad. And it can be hard to manage the people side of things. But that was *one* group. I'm not about to complain on reddit about that. I just shrugged and found another group.
---
I think I was probably right: Its just reporting bias (or whatever its called when you only hear from one "side" of an argument, because they constantly complain).
---
If you try to sit on the benches in LBRS, you'll sit facing the wall.
---
I started playing within a couple weeks of TBC dropping, and I was a human paladin on Galakrond, and it was always referred to as DM , maybe because of TBC dropping and Dire Maul not being run as much ? I dunno
---
Dawg, it's widely accepted that horde are advantaged in the leveling world. Even though you've failed multiple times to address the points made by others, let's address the two points you made.
---
1) backdoor to every capital city - what does this even matter for leveling? It literally harms you 0 if your capital city leader dies. And it's a city, so you can avoid being flagged if you really want. Plus horde capital cities have stronger guards. Again, don't understand how this inconveniences you at all so let me know and I can probably provide more info.
---
2) Barrens are massive and slow to level. The Barrens takes horde from 10 up through level ~25 counting camp T. Let's look at the alliance equivalent: Westfall, Redridge, and Duskwood. The combination of these three zones is also a giant area, and it's even further disjointed by Elwynn being in between Westfall and Redridge. Additionally, Redridge and Duskwood are contested zones - so horde can, and often do gank relentlessly there. The Barrens is actually a blessing of a zone for y'all in that regard - and it's free passage to booty bay. And you get free passage to Grom'gol anyway. 
---
Compared to having to run half an hour for RFK/RFD/SM, having worse PvP racials, Darnassus being our only major presence in Kalimdor and it's not even in Kalimdor, and all the other points people have already raised to you? Yeah, I'd say Horde are advantaged during the leveling process. Also, this isn't a particularly 'hot take' but rather has been generally accepted by the community since (at least) the end of real vanilla. It's why balance has been more directly symmetrical in every expansion since true vanilla. You're entitled to believe what you want, but know that your opinion differs from the accepted consensus of the community. And that's fine.
---
there's no reason for efficiency in dungeons pre-60, every fight lasts less than a minute
---
You may not like it, but that's a shaman at peak performance. Pre-raid bis and tier 1 shoulders. Goddamn those shoulders look awful though lol.
---
What you said is relevant for every class and every role. Everyone needs to get good, a group of 4 unskilled newbies + a pro tank will be dysfunctional. Tanking doesn't seem hard to me in vanilla, but then again nothing really seems hard. The game's slow and more about preparation and knowing your limitations than leet button pressing skills.
---
Heh you started with the snark my friend, not me. Of course I have nothing to go on but my experiences, it's all any of us have. But there's always gotta be someone jumping in to point that out.
---
I think what I think based off the info I have, as do you. No need to get worked up over it.
---
Do you have if installed on an SSD? OR windows installed on an ssd?
---
I thought I was the only one who does that lol...

I Mean...yeah threats a thing, but any boss that can crit/crush warriors is probably going to be better, just cause you're not oversoaking, and also, right now druids are fine because all of the gear hasn't really started climbing, but heading into BWL etc...gear is going to grow leaps and bounds better for warriors...while feral tanks literally have to wear DPS gear and hope they don't get mega trucked by a crit + parryhaste crit
---
What type of madman are you to try to tank without consecration.
---
Thrash blade is so slow, you'd be better off with the mana mace from mara
---
You really shouldn't bother with anything in the Destro tree right now. Until hit gear is available the spec isn't really worth your time. I ONLY cast SB on Shadow Trance procs, otherwise it's not worth it. Throw your dots, Drain life, then if your mana looks good for your situation go ahead and cast the instant SB. In all reality I would say that most of my shadow trance procs don't even get used.
---
It's an open ended game man, you do whatever you find fun.

---
There's a lot of totally wrong shit in there. If you're going by this I assume you also call Zul'Farrak "Zul", and BoP items "BoA"?
---
You can also google and find a lot of WoW devs/employees that state its DM and not VC. It makes absolutely no sense that 1, and only 1, dungeon would use a different naming standard from literally everything else.
---
shit game, fix it already
---
Why should I read what you have to say when it doesn't pertain to me? Like you are so deluded it isn't funny. You also have no idea the percentage my dude. BGs aren't out yet. I've met over 40 twinks just on my server. Ran into one from alliance and we fought in gurubashi even. You're just stupid af lol
---
You're literally just getting aoe threat via a burst of damage - its nice initially sure but in the end aoe will still just pull aggro if you don't switch into threat-generating abilities. Most classes can out-dps an arms warrior single target (which will pull your unmodded threat) and any aoe caster will still pull aggro somewhere in the pull.
---
Then you're waiting for SS between pulls, where a standard tank can just pull, demo + bs, and start tab sundering before focusing threat into the dps target.
---
There's no real "theyre bad" here, youre just hitting ss, wwing and then cleaving. Very straightforward.
---
It's a brief spike of initial aggro at the cost of slower pulling and healer mana.
---
-Instant mail between account characters. So I can mail my bank alt items or transfer my gold around without inconveniencing anyone
---
-AoE loot would be nice but not essential (I like the current style because I‚Äôm a skinner and it means others can‚Äôt skin my aoe farmed mobs)
---
The issue is not both being dickbags, the issue is 1 is physical violence and the other one is an inconvience in a video game.
---
Like Jesus Christ dude
---
Hows he been performing with Spelladin? It had a lot of talk going for it a few months back now nobody even mentions it.
---
As someone who absolutely hates leveling, I don't know how you voluntarily did this.
---
&gt;Doesn't have Imp Shield Block, Last Stand, or Mortal Strike.
---
&gt;3 random points in Cruelty when missing necessary skills from main trees.
---
Can't say I agree with this one.
---
I mean, it is as to the extent running far enough way to not have the adds on you is. It is using basic game mechanics to do something unintended. If it was a max level dungeon people would be running dozens of times they might do something about it but most people are going to clear Uldaman 0-4 times or so and never come back and it's fun to try out stuff like this on your later attempts.
---
Frostbite will ruin any true AoE farming as mobs will randomly get frozen and break away from all the others. Will make it very hard to keep hitting everything you're pulling and probably get you killed on big pulls.
---
Oh he *definitely* likes to party
---
No, we actually go for groups. There's a lot more horde than ally on my server so people are in groups everywhere. We 2v4d a group the other day in stonetalon mountains that were all within 3 lvls of us and they called a lvl 60 priest over to camp us. 
---
2v4 isn't fair? Lmao. I wouldn't even be mad if they called over a 5th guy their level, let's just keep it within a fighting range.
---
If you're being corpse camped you can always spirit rez.  If all the npcs are being repeatedly killed you don't really have options.
---
Haha good!
---
Yeah I think my grind was helped by doing it at 2am
---
Yeah big roof on my part. Enchanting sucks. And I get first dibs on mc patterns but they don't drop.
---
is there an addon that counts how much stuff i have sitting in the mail? i have one that show how much (i.e runecloth) i have in my alts bags and bank, but the mail box gets ignored
---
That's the thing tho, hes attacking from everywhere. Not just one spot
---
And yet you come and ready it, then reply with irrelevant stuff. 
---
Come on, say why aren't you doing pvp at 60 and what's so complicated at a lvl 19 twink that makes it so exciting, except pwning noobs in white gear?
---
Lets be real both sides do that and most people only attack when its slanted in their advantage. If you were horde you'd likely say the same thing.
---
Although I've been out doing early morning fishing and almost everyone just leaves me alone regardless of level. However out questing I get ganked by high levels, groups ect. Normally if it's one they never attack, some wait till I'm in to deep with mobs.
---
Gandling
---
No, just temporarily tame the new owl to learn higher-rank abilities, then teach them to your original owl. The original owl has higher loyalty and thus doesn't need to be fed as often, and it would take a while for the new owl to reach that loyalty level. Unless you like the new owl's color scheme better, there's no reason to abandon your old one for a new pet of the same species.
---
I lost a best in slot evasion (for feral) neck to a fury warrior because "I might be asked to off tank." Fuck your off tanking, I am actually tanking... Right now... Now, for everyone but you. PS I told our healer to not heal you from this point on.
---
75g on my server. Just use it :D
---
No, hes standing in the middle of town, not on anything.
---
What about when it crits though? Sometimes it will do insane damage when it double crits and it seems to pretty often (fury warrior)

There's a lot of primary advice in here. Some supplemental advice: stay calm during encounters, even if it means doing things slowly at first. You don't have much to lose from dying except your time. During corpse runs or after fights, think about the engagement. Remember what you did right, what was luck, and what you can do better next time. 
---
But most importantly stay calm during fights.
---
The first one.
---
I did have heart of the wild spec but then my guild convinced me to fully respec to a deep Resto build and then I didn‚Äôt like that so I respecced to the mess I have now - all this to say that respeccing is pretty pricy for me at this point because I‚Äôve done it several times.
---
Idk my main problem, which I know is probably stupid, is that I don‚Äôt notice them until they‚Äôre coming out of stealth literally on top of me and doing whatever that thing is that rogues do that stuns and then I‚Äôm stunned for however long and I can‚Äôt shapeshift or do anything and by the time I‚Äôm unstunned they‚Äôre up close and personal to me
---
Also, using my mouse
---
Technically so are humans gnomes and dwarves. Well, robots.
---
Deadmines is too low level for a tank to really matter. Most of my groups at that level were just 4 dps and a healer.
---
I read that it was extremely buggy a couple weeks back. Has there been an update?
---
Warlock pets, too.
---
Thanks, I will be doing that ! :)
---
What a clown. I pity the people that join these groups.
---
You could turn this into that Parks and Recs meme with the Venezuelan official saying, "Jail," after every minor infraction heh
---
I'm on a Normal server and it's been like that too. Every escort mission once you get to Thousand Needles is camped.
---
*that sweet victory when your plucky rag-tag party of level 25 strangers finally completes the quest despite the best efforts of some 40s though*
---
Expect this sort of thing to be turned up to 11, once the honor system comes out.  Stuff like this still happen all the time to bait other high levels to come out and fight.
---
Happens to me as well, no fix found yet...
---
Yes so after getting fucked up by other rogues who would sap me out of stealth, i went with a subt build that has both cold blood, prep and hemo.
---
But yeah i just dont have the timing down on stuns, once i get in a pvp situation my heart starts pounding and i start jamming like every button possible.
---
Really what i feel like i should do is duel people which i haven't done at all.
---
&gt;Then I always run a bit to the side so everybody can see me NOT having agro.
---
How often does that work?
---
Nah you're wrong. PVE realm describes exactly what you're looking for. Or Retail. PVP realm is signing up to gank and be ganked
---
Mage counterspelling warriors totally recks their day. I used to get a lot of odd looks for doing this back in the day because ‚Äúwarriors don‚Äôt cast spells‚Äù, however think about it:
---
Counter spell = instant cast/off GCD/almost no mana cost, puts warriors in combat (can‚Äôt charge) 
---
TLDR: counter spell warriors to prevent getting charged.
---
No, not mathematically.
---
You have just been super unlucky.
---
EVERY SINGLE RUN the % chance goes back to 10%. so every time you run it, you have a 10% chance to get it, but that doesn't "Average" out over the course of runs.
---
Stop trying to say "Ah but we have run it x amount of times so it should be dropped at least this many times" do you know how % even work?
---
The % is based PER RUN, and resets back to that EVERY RUN. 
---
As i said earlier, you could run it 100 times and not see it drop once (Being a 10% chance to drop EVERY RUN) where a s someone else could run it 10 times and have it drop 5 times.
---
THAT is how it works.......
---
Geez im sick of people not understanding how % work.......
---
Lol right. It‚Äôs Sodapoppins and Asmongolda fault no one noticed these things. 
---
Or maybe because the beta ended before we even got a chance to enter these dungeon? How do you expect streamers ON BETA to test out UBRS boss levels?
---
Oh, well then you're shit out of luck unfortunately. If he's just blocking and not doing an actual exploit and you're on a PvP server then a GM won't care.
---
You monster!
---
What does your 2h-ww macro look like? Mine is set so it switches to my 2h, berserker, and casts ww but doesn't cast ww even with the required rage and talented into arms for the stance change talents. Is the change into berserker stance part of the macro stopping the ww cast because it takes a gcd?
---
I can always just use the macro to switch weapons and stance and cast ww myself but was just curious if I could save that extra button press.
---
Imagine trying to do this on a PvP server. &gt;.&gt;
---
yeah, I'd say escape artists is among the strongest... for melee
---
Next you'll be telling me that the skull isn't just a fancy icon for random mobs or that I'm *not* supposed to stand in the fire.
---
On my server it was both, and a flame war would erupt in trade chat every ~15 minutes. Was always a lot of fun (khadgar)
---
I don‚Äôt think I provided enough context in my comment for you to make such an assessment.
---
I leveled combat swords all the way to 60, so I‚Äôm well aware of their capabilities, DPS throughput, and durability.
---
I switched to daggers now because I want to get used to the play style before BGs drop. I was just commenting on my experiences with the other build, that‚Äôs all.
---
As a side note, if MC was getting cleared by incomplete teams (&lt;40 players), players level 55+, and some wearing green gear - then there are diminishing returns on DPS, talent spec, and gear optimization. 
---
Somewhere exists a minimum DPS required for every fight, anything greater than that is just padding for time and bad player mechanics.
---
That being said, I‚Äôd rather a teammate that‚Äôs really good at a suboptimal spec than terrible at the highest DPS spec. If someone went combat swords but pumps out 200dps when they could pump out 205dps with a dagger build, I‚Äôll take the dagger build.
---
My experience was that combat swords (with blade flurry used whenever I noticed it off CD) was pumping out about 275dps across the entire dungeon, while my ambush build was outputting 235ish. 40dps is a lot solo, but if the team as a whole averages 800dps, then it‚Äôs only a 5% difference in clear time.
---
I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm a great player by any means, I‚Äôd argue the opposite quite frankly. But I‚Äôve thus far found it‚Äôs easier to chain kill in wPvP as daggers than swords.
---
Hope I didn‚Äôt come off poorly! Sorry if I did.
---
I can't play without one anymore.
---
Nice dungeon mechanic
---
Indeed woosh. Don't you know you need a /s for sarcasm on reddit! =P
---
Us EQ veterans sitting here like "32 buff slots, ya'll don't know how good ya got it."  
---
I mean, OP you bring up "tenants of RPGs" But balancing your enchants/buffs is a much stronger core value of RPGs (Like D&amp;D) Than stacking as many of them as possible because the rules allow for them to stack (Like Munchkin) F Y I - in most RPGs, many of these effects would not stack. So uh, play smarter in the meanwhile - that's the spirit of Vanilla. Don't bitch on the forums, crap like this is what created the casual monster we have in live.
---
You missed a step. Sheep pyro pom pyro. Insta kill anyone every 3 min!
---
Pics or it didn't happen, that would be hacking but if I had to bet money he's attacking people in the deadzone and running out to get the guards to aggro on the people chasing him or something. But server-side stuff like player position and NPC reactions shouldn't be hackable, so I really doubt he's actually hacking; and again if he were, he would *never* aggro the guards and need to ice block.
---
Heart of the wild. 1/29/21. 
---
Spec feral until Heart of the Wild (arguably jump in to get Furor from the resto tree once you have the Cat movement speed buff) then go down the resto tree to fill the rest out.
---
Dude same, I thought my internet was just being stupid, but I'd stay in discord without lag, so wtf blizzard
---
Yeah I hate having to fly to get them.
---
I also hate that I can't find a meat vendor in UC. Someone please tell me I'm wrong about there not being one
---
Would be better without your pet :)
---
Username checks out! Good stuff
---
I agree. Like I said you will need a higher tank/dps to compensate.
---
Oh Jesus, I was one of those kids who bought that book and brought it with me to school to read through constantly. 15 year old waves of cringe passing through me.
---
Whitemane? We had someone doing that yesterday for 4 hours. I logged off after reaching Tanaris and watching an undead mage kill some alliance. After doing some house work I got back on 2 hours later and he was still killing. Ran ZF and did some quests, 2 hours later... still there. Thankfully I never died to him although I got tagged by an occasional frostbolt.
---
Nope! I'm sure it's a common occurrence lol.
---
Had a good pvp moment last night around Southshore.
---
Was killing the murlocs off the coast on my 32 druid and had aggro on 1 murloc caster and also a bear.
---
30 something tauren druid comes up and starts moonfiring me. Initiate like 5 min long pvp battle. I kept healing/nature's grasp to get the mobs off me while I try and take this dude down. He keeps healing. Finally able to dps him down somehow and killed the mobs afterwards.
---
I'm not too big on pvp so it was pretty epic for me to be able to get ambushed while fighting other mobs and be able to finish everyone off.
---
I swear though, druid vs druid takes forever haha.
---
Level 49 (almost 50) troll priest with pretty much an empty quest log after finishing hinterlands. What does the next 5 levels look like? Questing and dungeon wise
---
They should add this but the catch is another player is the driver and gets the money you pay to be shuttled around.
---
I think you misread, he also said he only saw VC
---
What calculation goes into making a key binding?
---
As a Warlock, I can relate.
---
MC is fun because I get to Banish thing at least.
---
True. The people who casually handle obstacles and frustration don't come to Reddit to complain about their sads and so we get a self-selecting group who make the whining seem more prevalent than it is amongst the player base.  That's a problem with Reddit vs. life in general, I find.
---
He can chase Alliance running outside the walls while attack and nothing happens
---
no.
---
Thinking to myself the whole time "man shadow priests are so broken, but so cool!" Time to reroll.
---
Is this the build you're talking about?  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/-500242130320215-05501310231](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/-500242130320215-05501310231)  It's really pricey for me to respec at this point (like 15g or so I think) so I want to make sure this is it and it's worth respeccing to.
---
Ok so it tested retail and it's running normally. It would've frozen by now if it was classic so it seems to be isolated
---
Nice downvote, nowhere in your post did you say that. All you said was you and a friend were killing horde around your level. I also doubt your recollection of events considering most people aren't leveling in groups.
---
That‚Äôs true. But he‚Äôs not killing NPCs is he. If he were camping a zone with mobs that you needed to kill for a quest (or mass ape farming them) you could go somewhere else. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with camping a location of unique mobs, so I don‚Äôt think camping an escort route is any different. Annoying as hell, but not wrong enough for blizzard action.
---
probably because it requires new development effort to recreate
---
Desolace is a nice change.   
---
It's quiet, and you can focus on things you may miss in other zones. You don't have half a dozen overlapping quests. You don't have fierce competition for mobs or spawns. The only time i ran into someone other than alliance was in Thunder Axe Fortress (slick name.)   
---
I'm not saying that I'd set up shop there and raise a family in the bleak landscape, but its a welcome change.
---
Depends on where you're based. From Undercity, the edge of WPL is a short ride, or you can fly to Light's Hope in EPL.
---
So you are a shadow weaver?
---
I believe the same thing happened to me a while ago. I opened a ticket and the people who responded made me run a couple tests. We ended up having to call my ISP and have them come out and look at what is going on. I ended up having a bad wiring job and it got to the point where it was stuttering my connection.
---
Why are y'all talking about TBC already? Classic has been out for 2 months. Slow down a little.
---
Classic was out for YEARS before TBC came out.
---
Ashbringer?
---
i actually main a warrior tank and chuckle when i see a warrior LF tank in chat.  i always think good luck with that.  that's when i started wondering how his other party members must feel.  i won't party with dps warriors because i don't want the loot competition.   i mean it's silly for a warrior tank to needlessly add loot competition when another group is so easy to find.
---
I'm not sure id classify them as a zerg guild, they have a ton of 60s and have downed Rag. 
---
Most zerg guilds are filled with lowbies and struggle with end game content. They're mostly just a large raiding guild.
---
There's guilds with like 10+ raid teams though, so even then a 3 raid team guild is not all that big.
---
As a Paladin, I've gotten lazy about this. Flash of Light feels almost free.
---
Wand!
---
I have been unable to sell a single crusader enchant. Can anyone help with the price I should be selling it for (your mats vs my mats) and how to properly advertise my services?
---
What does this mean?
---
I'd be wary of that guild for a start. Deep resto isn't necessary at all, especially while levelling. Arguably, it isn't even the best healing build at 60. Them convincing you to respec at a low level is a huge red flag for me. Your respec cost should not be 15g at level 38.
---
I know you'll want your mount at 40, but levelling is a big part of the game and if you're spending most of your time in an abomination of a spec you'll be totally miserable. That's also probably a reason you're getting killed so easily. I'd use whatever money you have to respec into a good levelling build - google will have lots of answers. Before respeccing again read a lot of different articles to get a good idea of what you want. General build is 0/30/21, or 1/29/21 for nature's grasp. 
---
If you're getting stunlocked that quickly it's likely a level/gear issue. You mentioned that you panic when you get opened on. Learn not to panic, and remember your keybinds. Not all rogues at your level will be able to stun you 100% of the time. Keybind faerie fire and bear form and get used to getting into them. Bear form will have a stun that you can use against the rogue to give yourself time to get distance/heal. If you spec into HOTW, the feral talents there will give you access to more abilities that will help.

Nah. I'm holding my kid for upwards of 12 hours on some weekend days, much of the time she's sleeping in my arms. I'm going to get the best of both worlds, the experience of my daughter sleeping in my arms for hours and not being bored after the first 30 minutes.
---
LMFAO
---
Looks like a fun experience..... but you know that the "Character Stuck" feature just kills you now right? It doesn't hearth you anymore since that was too easily abused. Could've all just self killed using "Character Stuck" and ran back....
---
This shit would've been dead on arrival if it wasn't Blizzard.
---
That's because you're level 24. You've barely even scratched the surface of what your class is capable of.
---
MC = Mostly Cenarion
---
I did a BRD run (arena, angerforge, golem lord, flamewalker boss, emperor) in &lt; 30m the other day with a warrior with dual Dal Rends, and full DPS gear (Devilsaur, truestrike, unforgiven, hoj etc).   He was top DPS and aside from AOE and held threat like no other.   Our priest was in decent gear, not full prebis but good and in holy spec.
---
Everything went incredibly smoothly and we never wiped.
---
/shrug   I think player skill goes a long way,  if a priest is undergeared or if the DPS in the group sucks its probably necessary but our priest had zero problems keeping up because we were demolishing pulls so quickly.
---
some more autism like bet and oof
---
The first step is admitting you have a problem, hello I‚Äôm Rickman and I‚Äôm a mana-holic
---
&gt;This is a misconception. 
---
&gt;If you run the numbers, it‚Äôs extremely clear that higher ranking spells are more HPS, and more efficient heal/mana. 
---
&gt;Downranking heals should be reserved for when you have +healing gear. Since +healing gear statically increases output across all ranks, it disproportionately effects the efficiency of low ranked spells.
---
While that's true, it's still a good idea to downrank heals whenever you can. If you only need to restore 800 health, there's no reason to cast a 1400-health heal. The efficiency you "gain" is worse than just not using the extra mana in the first place.
---
See my previous comment, pics or I don't care, I'm betting that you are misunderstanding what he's doing and exploiting and how he's doing it.
---
Wait really
---
Yeah to level 18 then respecs haha burn
---
That‚Äôs what I figured. Mirah‚Äôs is worse than thrash for rogues right?
---
They're not allergic, it's just boring. 
---
A class built around the element of surprise's best build is spamming 1 button? 
---
Nah that's why many rogues avoid it.

is this from all furbolgs in winterspring? or just specific ones?

I cant tell if that's sarcasm or not. Pom/Pyro is my favorite pvp mage spec and it rocks.
---
Gives you the ability to aoe farm, and more survivability with barrier and block/snap. If you get the shatter ice shards combo it does a ton of damage, if you're going pure single target then pick up frostbite and there you go big frost bolt damage.
---
There's a guy on my server,  I've seen him around,  he's multiboxing warlocks... I love that guy

It's literally how racism works lol
---
Same case for mediocre, unfun elite wannabe party-poopers.
---
Ty
---
No friggen joke! If I want to keep up with the pulls AND remake my mana crystals, I better have evocation up so I'm not wasting time! Itll be a bit better when Dire Maul comes out so we can get lvl 55 water. 4k per drink baybay!
---
This made me dizzy, I need to have a lie down now
---
Yuck. My hearth is gromgol, guess it's gotta stay.
---
Personally, I use specific keybinds for specific tasks. Interrupt goes on a keybind no matter class I'm playing, same with fears, stuns, self healing tools, etc.
---
A bit different in classic than in retail but still the same premise
---
You are saying warlock mount is bad because you can't use it after being spell locked or silenced. You also can't use a normal mount after being spell locked or silenced because you are in combat.
---
It's all about streamers. Streamers rushed content and are bored now. Streamers are free advertising. Blizzard releases dire maul early so the streamers keep playing. I'd rather them move the pvp timetable up but whatever.
---
This just reminded me I didn't put my latest talent point to use.
---
here is mine https://imgur.com/a/ksu0wzI
---
Good catch.  I forget that blue names = coward on PVP servers.
---
Not just melee. Some holy pallies have a bad habit of standing beside me while I‚Äôm tanking and ripping consecrates every 8 seconds. Not only does that totally ruin their regen, it also puts them at risk of getting aggro. I‚Äôd much rather they conserve their mans for healing. I try to tell them not to but some won‚Äôt listen. I don‚Äôt get why they do it.
---
that and not having to drink for every couple of kills. instead we inject ourselves with cloth for 8 seconds and go right back to killing
---
Yes. Someone from my first RFC group fell in  the pit. He self killed and the healer res'd him out. ezpz
---
Why are you on a classic server lol, time spent is the essence of classic
---
I'm sorry but you are just wrong about all of this. 
---
SS is on a 30 sec CD there is no "waiting" between pulls. ST threat is not an issue at all for any spec of warrior unless they have no idea what they are doing. 
---
This is how you tank as arms. You charge, SS, BS/DS to dump down to 25 rage, swap to serker, WW, serker rage, then go defensive stance and spam cleaves/revenge/tab sunder. This is by far the most threat any class can do in a dungeon environment, specifically while leveling up. Tell the DPS to start going ham once you swap to serker stance. 
---
There is no "brief spike of initial aggro" there. Ive tanked every single dungeon doing this including UBRS (which I wouldnt recommend too much unless your in a non-PuG), and no one pulls threat on me. There is no pulling slower with a 30 sec CD that you pop on pull, you do not cost good healers additional mana if they know what they are doing. Hell, my priest healer buddy did this in strat with me last night to help a guildie and he had renew as 65% of his healing done overall and was just DPSing because I took very little damage and stuff died fast as hell. 
---
&gt;There's no real "theyre bad" here, youre just hitting ss, wwing and then cleaving.
---
This is wrong. 
---
You are just wrong about this entirely. This is by far the most amount of AoE threat a warrior can do in a dungeon situation by a mile. If people you are playing with are just going in battle stance, popping SS, then WW/Cleaving, they are the problem, not the spec. Also, I'm curious what you are comparing it to? What build for warrior do you think does more AoE threat?
---
Lmao no this whole thing is a bunch of people jokingly shitting on mages, which obviously struck a nerve with you
---
Literally no one on Reddit cares that you don't suck at the game. Not a single person. Your anecdote is at best worthless.
---
The PoM pyro mage is a fun build just not the most competitive.
---
*clenches heart waiting for blood pressure to go up*
---
Is it very difficult? I have a lvl 54 Druid and I didn't find it that difficult
---
Can you post one you made? Definitely interested to see how itll look.
---
What you are saying is that everyone who doesn't want to be randomly killed for no reason, with no ability to fight back, they will leave the game because they do not Care enough. That will be a "special experience" for those people who stick around and just i guess gank each other. 
---
What you have said is retarded. The only good reason to join a pvp server is to kill people like you; not just stunlock to death helpless people who have no ability to fight back. God you people are retarded.
---
Clean
---
druids eat rogues
---
Thrash Blade has 2x chance to proc with Seal of Righteousness, and even moreso with Hand of Justice. (Fantastic for pally threat generation)
---
I plan on keeping TB until I get either Ironfoe or Quel'Serrar.
---
Thanks for the suggestion though!
---
The problem is with feign death not working, it has nothing to do with a macro or anything.
---
Free action potion are WAY to good
---
No. It has it's uses.
---
Thank you :)
---
Costs Mana. Can be silenced. Is on GCD. Regular mount is objectively better for PVP.
---
Classic player: "I need to calculate what keybinds I want to use for the abilities I haven't unlocked yet"

Vanilla player: "WTF is a keybind"

---
Thank you for this write up! I'm only 51 so I'll be trying this in a few days!
---
Ooo so it‚Äôs literally just not dropping combat?
---
No place in PvE? That's a bit of a stretch. Bursting is incredibly important for fights with a timer.
---
Subtlety tree also has imp sap, which is a huge boon to dungeons.
---
One of the biggest draws of classic was the drama on the server forums.
---
Occasionally you‚Äôd get useful trades and crafting deals, but mostly it was a whole lot of useless accusations and counter accusations about griefing or ninjaing. The peak was claims of some woman cheating on her husband with their GM.
---
Great way to stay engaged while away from the gaming PC.
---
Evidence?

Found the unemployed dude!

Magnifique. GG.

There's one right by RFD you do/can do when getting the named Grimtotem.
---
There's also another one in Highperch. Both of them, like all escort quests, are pretty awful.
---
It's how I got every single piece of my BiS. Even brought a druid OT for Draconic Deflector.
---
Congrats! I have tried this numerous times before on retail but gave up before reaching the end. I might have to give this a go on Classic.
---
It would make a bit more sense if it was a GIF. This is the cutscene from WC3 where Arthas reaches Frostmourne and throws down his hammer. The implication that &lt;insert class here&gt; would throw away their old gear when they finally picked up &lt;insert literally any upgrade slot here&gt;
---
This is wrong.  Stop trying to be a bad ass.  This is like the most wrong you could fit into a single post.
---
1.  OP's title says they looked online and couldn't find anything.
---
2.  That means they knew about macros.
---
3.  That means they simply didn't search for how to make macros, they searched for a warrior macro that did what they want, and didn't search correctly.
---
4.  I didn't say anything about "he should just not use it", in fact, I provided the *exact* solution.
---
And obviously my incredulity at the incorrect assumption of Mages all being bad struck one with you. So much so that you're still replying to me even after being thoroughly corrected. I never thought anyone cared, and could not care less that anyone doesn't, but YOU clearly care about something, else you wouldn't still be replying.
---
Anything else?
---
When I started BGs were a thing, so every few levels I'd join in some BGs, even if I got destroyed by twinks.
---
I play for the PvP, so if I don't hit 60 before BGs come out, I'll probably not make any progress for quite a while...
---
Somebody put Mr. Bluesky behind it
---
Exactly!
---
Going at a certain speed (not hyper fast, but not 80% mana for everyone before each pull slow) actually makes things *safer* because it:
---
1. Gives tank chance to generate threat, rage
---
2. Creates a sort of rhythm that the group falls into, making it easy to predict what your groupies are gonna do next.
---
3. Stops people from taking ninja-afks. If you gotta pee, just tell us. Its fine!
---
And its fun. Really fun. I can't stress how much I love looking at my mana struggling to stay over 50%, cooldowns spent, etc. while we're blazing through a dungeon. Feels right.
---
Nice find.
---
GIT TOSSED NO BELIEVERS
---
Have you tried to run strat? It's probably one of the hardest instances to get groups for.
---
Lol. Plenty of people with a job are 60 by now... What the ever living fuck.
---
I was mainly saying how if you're that obsessed with the game it's weird you have not put any time into it.
---
Im sure this has been asked before but... whats the best enchantment to put on a whirlwind axe for solo grinding/melee cleave groups? I have a lvl 60 enchanter buddy and lots of gold on my main.
---
Unless they are camping you at the graveyard.
---
Honestly at this point it should probably replace the looking for group/guild one thats up on Mondays.
---
At this point nearly everyone is well established on their servers, and all the servers have their own sub as far as i know, you can recruit in game and on the blizz forums, etc.
---
That post has been up for 11+ hours and theres 82 comments in there.  Its just not really needed at this point and is a waste of one of the two sticky slots.
---
I do kind of doubt that people would use it, though.
---
\+-2 years. Blizzard might choose to accelerate this little bit though, because lot of players will get bored with slow original like progression - everyone knows everythhing now and they are pretty much blazing through the content.
---
That change didn‚Äôt happen until 2.0
---
Blackstone Ring is unique, Tarnished Elven is not. So you can have 2x Tarnished, and get benefit from both, but you cannot have a second Blackstone.
---
Its wrong. Blizzard released how weapon skill works.
---
Yes its BiS for non orc/humans.
---
Also, are regular mounts off the gcd? If i lifetap or whatever i have to wait a gcd to cast felsteed
---
Oh I know, and I have. I'm mostly just indulging in some faction shit-talk when I go "Horde Bad". I'm 15 years of Retail Horde, and as a primarily PVE Server player leveling War Mode BFA was one of the worst experiences of my life ("10% eXp BoOsT iS FaStEr") Night Elf Rogues everywhere, whole quest hubs rendered useless by spawn camping.
---
It's given me a bit of a "be the change you wish to see" outlook on it. I leave greens and greys alone. No need to perpetuate the harassment.
---
Holy shit, when the Druid started healing got me good. Top quality content
---
It's definitely a scummy thing to do (same faction stealing).  See tons of people trying to justify it in every which way nonetheless
---
That really isn't an excuse when you have tanks saying "LET ME GET AGGRO" and DPS going "lol nope", pulling aggro, dying, then blaming the tank.
---
There's only so much idiocy you can excuse - people should be aware that different games work differently.
---
Fire is also more gear dependant, not only do you need better gear for it to work on top of that all the bosses are essentially immune to fire right now so yeah on terms of fire that will be put off until zg. And the best mage raiding spec is 31 points into arcane, but yeah you need one guy to go deep frost to pickup winters chill. I think fire is cool sometimes in classic but both fire and arcane spec feel really underdeveloped in classic so until TBC and beyond is a thing I think frost just feels the best. Fire and arcane spec mages just fall over because they have zero defensives and control.
---
I ended up going w/ Auctionator. I had the vendor price addon as well. I think it's just called "VendorPrice."
---
Is this on incendius?
---
Lol savage
---
Hehe. Thank you.
---
He‚Äôs not blocking an npc tho
---
wait what? im new to WoW but i thought the best way is ‚Äúat 45% everyone except tank, rogues and hunters stop dps, so rogues/hunters finish Ony to 40% when she changes phase, cause they can vanish/death so they drop agro to zero. So, everyone has zero agro so tank just grap ony after and thats all, no?
---
I mean given that they‚Äôre two very different game categories, I doubt they‚Äôre concerned about fortnite
---
This is only true in cases of overhealing. In which case, at low levels, you should simply wait longer to cast the heal. You shouldn‚Äôt be deliberately casting inefficient spells for the sake of keeping people topped off.
---
Yea, except they need a lock.  And I am looking for much faster due to time constraints.
---
Can we please get a photoshop
---
I know on private you can blink through the door. I hope you still can but i think that was a mangos issue.
---
Keep going pal
---
YEA!?
---
Probably because anytime someone does then 15 people chime in to say how much better "X" setup is.
---
There's also an escort quest with the wyverns up on the mountain side.
---
Thanks I'll check that one out.
---
Been looking at that from time to time as well. Usually the Arcane Crystals are so expensive that I could make 3-5g max, if the Bar sells on the first try.
---
I know the crystals are "rare" but they're not on a day long cooldown... kind of annoying.
---
There is no hidden make dalrends drop mechanic. RNG is just being RNG. You're unlucky that's about it. Not gonna make you feel better but I've seen 4 offhands in like 25 runs. Random is random
---
It does, but the reduction vs other stats you could have in that slot make it not worth it. And just to be clear, having 5+ wep skill reduces the amount of hit% you need for the special cap from 9% to 6%. Not sure what you mean by 1%.
---
Ha, yeah that‚Äôs what i meant by watching streams. But if you can make it work, do it.
---
Yup! Some favourite things to ruin include the chicken escorts and hillsbrad fields/mines
---
Maybe I should try it. Although I‚Äôve posted it now so might as well just leave it I guess. Maybe for the next one :)
---
*visibly confused warrior*
---
My tank went to get smokes and he still hasn't come back, it's been 18 years....
---
/u/eddiemac01 also:
---
5 second rule refers to mana regen.
---
When you cast a spell your spirit based mana regen is halted for 5 seconds.
---
Some classes get talents, abilities, or tier bonuses that allow them to bypass this
---
Mage's Mage Armor allows 30% of your spirit regen to occur during this window
---
Mages, Druids, and priests Priests get a talent (in their arcane, resto, and disc trees respectively) that allows 15% of spirit regen to occur during this period
---
Also, effects that say "X mana per 5 seconds" on gear also bypass this rule (making it the best stat for classes like shamans who lack any other way to bypass it)
---
Yes, the software depends on what device you're streaming from though. For computers running Windows just install steam on both and log into your account. For Android/iOS install the software from the app / play store. I've never used a steam link box but I think it's just a modified version of the PC client that stays in big picture mode.
---
I went to almost complete desolacw then STV. Honesty STV isn't too bad. I've been killed a few times around nessingwary but the gy is pretty close. And I find most people in the opposing faction are just as scared as I am. I got killed mostly by people with higher level.
---
I can confirm looted both the skin from the garuntee spot next to boss and off a bone construct. I have the items in my bank.
---
I'm convinced that the only ones who are vehemently arguing about this shit are turbo autists
---
Use context clues and don't be a moron, problem solved.
---
wow is a hell of a drug. i'm struggling with it since i'm 16. years old. still 15 years later i try to understand how wow effects my thinking. i played classic back then again from 2012-2019 on a private server and now on official classic. it somehow really got me and changes me while im on it. 
---
the only way to get away from it is to make mysrlf not to think about it in my everyday life. this makes me forget about it after one or two days. with this distance i can deside more clearly about rl/game ratio
---
Maybe addon conflicts?
---
Idk either, I really like Aux interface but the Full Scan is so dang slow, which is absolutely killing my vendor flipping.
---
Takes a solid 15 minutes to do a 
---
     &lt;&gt;/vendor-profit/1c
---
 search... but Auctionator can do a full scan of every item in the AH in 20 seconds, while singular items take longer than Aux ([Mana Potion] for example takes ~30seconds to scan 6 pages on Auctionator, but maybe 3-5 seconds with Aux)
---
I wish I could use both, or import scan data from Auctionator into Aux...
---
Sometimes RNG will not be in your favor for a long time. It's just the nature of RNG.

I'd like my bag space back please.
---
Also,  the Dire Maul Arena Bosses (The Razza, etc)  have been spawning since server launch,  and if you have the above knowledge you'd be farming them 6x a day (4hr respawn timer) across both layers.  They guarantee drop 2 boe blues.  
---
BUT OH NO NO NO YOU CANT HAVE YOUR KEYRING!!!
---
Um, well, it doesn't feel less efficient to me. But please check my math here:
---
I don't take damage because I'm not face tanking so I never have to eat and very rarely need to bandage. My current build is 24/8/13.
---
To kill 1 solo mob it's seriously Stealth, Distract, Ambush, Gouge, Backstab, SS/Eviscerate, loot, skin, targetnexttarget, repeat. No need for kidney shot.
---
Oh, and even if I do get an add, evasion or blind works just fine. Vanish in an emergency.
---
I find it hard to believe swords is as efficient as 3 shotting mobs my level in about 4-5 seconds, but go ahead and do whatever works for you.
---
In Strat Live, just where the barricades are, if you clear around the right side and leave the mobs in the middle, then pull the scarlets behind them and kill them, the mobs up front have a script where they fall back to the door to defend the citadel and have a yell to that effect.
---
Timmy also spawns when you kill the guards directly in front of the stairs and doesnt require clearing all the scarlets.
---
In BRD, a lot of people dont actually know what the Shadowforge key does when you use it on the chain. The "bridge" you cross is actually the inside of an enormous gate, which you shut to close the gate. If you leave the gate open, you can go to the highway, run the opposite direction of BaelGar and go through it to Incendious. If you use the key, you actually block off that passage and it creates a dead end in the middle of the highway.
---
So much silliness in one post that I need to address:
---
1) You got your Classic no-changes.  Can we TBC/WotLK lovers please have those games no-changes, rather than with your ideals forced upon it?  I liked TBC precisely BECAUSE of flying, catch-up gear, arena, resilience, and all the things classic blowhards claim ruined the game.  I'm not alone in this, obviously.  The "Essence" of TBC and Wrath is markedly different to the "Essence" of Vanilla and it should remain that way.  The "Vanilla feel we all love" is not unanimous!
---
2) Removing Maggie and Gruul to world bosses that spawn once a week that guilds can fight over is retarded.   It's a bad system in Vanilla too because it essentially boils down to the top guild(s) getting the boss every-single-week and nobody else getting a thing.  If you're busy or on vacation when it spawns, then tough squat.  What a fantastic idea.  Let's introduce content that only a small proportion of the elite can actually play!
---
3) TBC had badge gear too.  Badges of Justice?
---
4) I can actually agree on the removal of LFG, so I'm a litttttle bit of a hypocrite, but if they kept it I would still play WotLK servers, gladly.
---

back in the day (2006)  I made tons of money with disenchanting.  Most people had no clue, so you could pick up cheap stuff to disenchant night and day.  
---
Around 2013 I played pservers and it still was ok, although you noticed a trend:  people got more knowledgeable.
---
Now in 2019 it's a disaster.  (Almost) everybody knows everything and has addons  and if an item's expected value to disenchant is 87s  you can bet 100g that you will (almost) never find it for sale for less than 80s.   And most are exact the EV of the item or more.
---
The profit margins are so slim that it takes a lot of transactions to make a little profit .  not worth your time, unless it;s the only thing you do in game.
---
So the only thing left to do is, combine it with tailoring or leatherworking and make whatever item is profitable  usually wicked leather stuff or runed blahblah cloth stuff.
---
Or get it to 300 with access to raid enchants, but that means you have to stand hours on the IF bridge to establish your Enchanting Emporium, get customers and build a name.  I play this game to become a soldier, not a peddler.
---
Blizzard does that kind of thing when it concerns competing games, Fortnite and Classic likely don't have much overlap.
---
Lol you're trying to farm them? Genius.
---
Hmm do they go to roll or are they looted directly to bag? 
---
Also, if it is a roll, whats the etiquette? Tank priority or All need similar to BoEs?
---
It‚Äôs the only way into this boys hole
---
We had a rogue in guild with over 100 runs, took so long he ended up getting vis‚Äôkag first
---
Only mules. For instance a guild leader might make a level 1 called "GuildNameBank" that they will store rare items or potions in.
---
Yep, BiS for all of classic for Cat and Bear (I think bear as well? Cat at least), and if you wanna be optimal, have to farm so. damn. many. of them.
---
That's thanks to his eye for detail on angling that bitch
---
I honestly think that everything will be cleared the day everything releases.  The few boss fights I think might put up a challenge are the following:
---
C'Thun / Thaddius and that's pretty much about it.  
---
And the only reason I say that, is because of how easy it is for 1 person to ruin your entire run on those bosses.  With 40 people instead of 25 having one idiot go unnoticed is going to be more likely.  But, I still expect every single raid to be cleared within hours of release no problem.  People are just that much better.
---
Everyone has advanced knowledge of all the bosses, and will have all the required resistance gear for the few resistance check fights Nature (Huhuran) / Frost (Sapphiron) Come to mind off-hand etc...
---
Basically there are no suprises, and everyone has done all the fights before, so there should be no problems.
---
I believe so. Or the guy that does it on Incendius had the same idea.
---
I'm a snowflake, then.  48 Tauren Prot War.

The satisfaction i get when i work hard for something. Like for levels, gold, items or drops. Feels good knowing that putting in effort yields high rewards.
---
In my experience they still spawn but they just take a while to get up to you which is nice.
---
He said arcane
---
How does it fall on the mage to suggest bigger pulls? Everyone can clealy see everyone elses health and mana. If the pulls are easy, pull more, sorry not everyone needs their hand held like you lol.
---
You only start regenerating mana based on spirit after five seconds of not casting.
---
Because felsteed is a spell it briefly stops your mana regen. I don't really get why that's important when you have life tap, but that's what the five second rule is.
---
I got dragged unto a pvp server by a couple of friends.
---
They didn't want to play as a couple of hunched over tards with a strange hue.
---
So here I am. Getting ganked by a couple of hunched over tards with a stiff dick and 10 levels on me. All for friendship.
---
Makes sense
---
No, these "bad features" are **not** "proven facts".  You need to accept the fact that more people liked flying, arenas and badge gear than not.
---
Also, claiming that these features are bad because "just look at how retail turned out" is also a weak, illogical argument.  There's still a **huge difference in design philosophy from TBC to BfA**. 
---
The first *step* on a path is not the same thing as the *end* of said path.
---
As a DPS warrior, I tank every 5 or 10 man (while leveling and at 60) and plan to stay DPS for raids unless the guild needs me as a tank with my offset. Pretty much all DPS warriors should be doing this, but I think at least half of them are trying to DPS in 5 mans because I usually have 1-3 other warriors in my group or asking to DPS for me.
---
The OP is right that DPS warriors not tanking 5 mans makes the dungeon tank shortage worse (and it's easily solved if warriors just tanked and of course rolled for their main spec DPS gear).
---
Actually I just need warder not houndmaster I forgot I got cape already. Is there a run that incorporates warder and something else I need?
---
Can't imagine that much of Classics playerbase is even mildly interested in Fortnite.
---
Wtf is fortnite?
---
Knight rank strats.
---
A lot of people say that threat doesn‚Äôt reset in p3. Either way you still let tanks get aggro before you blow her up in p3.
---
I don‚Äôt follow fortnight but it would make sense
---
Math says you're around 5% likely for that to happen. 0.96\^73
---
Not that I've seen. It's not a very common area for people to farm unless they want their quest from over there.
---
It simply means that everything you're targeting will have -10 resistance rating to your spells(arcane, frost and fire). If you hit a dwarf that naturally has 10 frost resistance, he will have 0 because of that talent, for example. It does not affect spell hit rating.
---
Any good farm spot people will probably be unlikely to share. That being said, if you want cloth, go to WPL and kill stuff at the farms or up north at hearthglen. If you have mining or herbalism it becomes much more rewarding up at heathglen. 
---
Besides that DM is going to be the place to farm starting tomorrow.
---
Yep. I usually just L t AA f them anyway. 
---
Don‚Äôt care. Save the outrage.
---
This is wrong. Feign death works fine for dropping combat as long as you do it properly. Don't be moving, don't be turning, and tell your pet to follow. Feign death will work fine at that point, and I think it should work fine with a macro as well. I even used it to drink during a boss in Molten Core last week.
---
only fight ive had an issue was rag. get into the habit of using pots/robe/gem CDs WAY before you need to for Rag/longer fights. Rag for example, around 70% mana i blew my first Mana Pot so in a few minutes when i actually needed it for adds it was back up for me!
---
Definitely, I‚Äôll see the alliance who stole the leather advertising their Devilsaur products in trade chat half an hour later. I want to call them out but I know nobody would give a shit, so I just stick the offenders on ignore and move on. Trust no one in the crater.
---
This was me in 2007. Then I did POM Pyro on the motherfuckers.
---
Isn't it considered poor etiquette to farm mobs that are required for quests? Especially in the higher levels I've repeatedly run into the problem that my main competitor for mobs I NEED for a quest are being farmed by several lvl 60 players.
---
And then there is warriors in full dps gear with a 2 hander who never leave zerker stance and say they are "tanking".
---
Sorry for the super old reply, just found this thread.
---
It's because Luna started as a stolen SUF. SUF's author didn't play on private servers, so OP took the addon and made it work for private servers. Eventually, OP renamed the addon to Luna and called it their own.
---
Now, OP seems to have forgotten they stole the original code, so they're developing for classic. They eventually got banned from Curse because of the stolen code, both LUF and LibClassicHealComm are based on SUF and LibHealComm-4.0, neither are OP's. SUF's author still isn't sure about going through a DMCA takedown of LUF on Github, since that process is a bit more involved.
---
Ah yes, our god-tier rotation
---
The 1% I was talking about was in reference to the disparity between the private server special hit cap and the true value, so 8% in private servers became 9% here.
---
Thanks for your comment that means I'm actually closer to being able to spec fury than I thought! Currently at +3% hit once I equip my [Tooth of Eranikus]. So I guess I just need to do the BRD quest for the 2% hit rating shoulders and find one other source of +1% hit.
---
No it isn't But how likely is a discussion about the Republic of the Niger instead of the usage of that word as an insult.
---
It does make it more effective use of your time though...
---
Yeah lol I googled the gloves then checked what drops them now I am killing frayfeather patriarchs over and over until they drop, I only started yesterday so we will seeee
---
Grob has been great, seems pretty balanced, more alliance if I had to guess.
---
yes. that should help.. the more you do it the better you'll get under pressure. don't forget how viable blind and gouge are vs other rogues... get used to blind/bandage when low on hp... you should able to stealth right before the cooldown is up and get another opener. timing is everything so cooldown timers are a must imo
---
Are you maybe trying to talk about frost? Not arcane?
---
oh
---
No it won't. It's already patched out on the version we're playing.
---
It's only really wasted time if you don't enjoy PvP, which is why there are PvE and PvP realms.

As much as I'm loving PvP and am looking forward to being rewarded for it, that's what I'm anxious about. I like PvPing around my level, I feel like a lot of my time will be spent running away from max level grinders who care only about the currency. And I really don't like grinders who don't even know how to have fun...
---
I leveled feral and had no problems healing through lvl 45ish content with a decent healing set of gear. For tanking, I think agility is preferred over strength anyway to give you more dodge.

---
I've seen dozens of warriors try this, I always end up MTing the rest of the run once the healers get sick of it.
---
I reliably pull aggro off the dps target when the "tank" tries to ss tank. AoErs reliably pulled aggro midway through pulls.
---
For it to be truly efficient you'd have to significantly outgear the dungeon, at which point why bother?
---
FFS all you're doing is two whirlwinds, a double white and its over. That means jack shit to an arcane explosion happy mage.
---
I'm a bear so it's a lot more planned than (like the priest will bubble me while I shift out because of the loss of armor and health) but yeah I do. I don't think I've ever hibernated a beast though, are there fights where that's useful? That sounds like a lot of fun
---
If the poisons/curses are mild annoyances I don't, but most curses are awful and I cure them fast unless I have a ton of rage

Oh here we go, your true colours show at last.  The old "cater to casuals" argument.
---
People like you.  So elitist.  You talk about your average person, the 'casual' like they're some kind of bad tumour that ruined the game.
---
Never mind the fact Cata introduced the hardest dungeons we'd seen yet, and raid bosses on heroic difficulty were also the hardest we'd seen yet, and that Cata had plenty of challenging content to offer.  *But no, you don't want the hoi-polloi to experience content on 'tourist mode' because it means the content is no longer the exclusive domain of the elite, right?*

I had it happen to my void lord last week though?

*[Laughs in Rogue]*
---
I usually buy a cheap grey/white weapon (2x if i can dw) put on my stam/tank gear and start with lvl 20 mobs until i can kill two/three before i need to eat/heal.  Spam hamstring
---
rinse and repeat every 15 or so mob levels
---
Oh I know. The red question mark is just my way of differentiating whether I actually know the spell or not since I made all my warr macros at level 1.
---
Plus its fun seeing my UI slowly come together lol
---
I actually will concede that server by server it might have varied, although everyone I know called it VC. Still, the strategy guide link entirely disproves the argument that "VC" only arrived after Dire Maul.
---
I don't know about ZF being called Zul, but BoP literally used to be BoA in beta. Not sure when it changed. [Source where they say it, just ctrl + f "acquire"](https://www.engadget.com/2011/04/12/wow-archivist-world-of-warcraft-beta-patch-0-10/).
---
I think there are 2-3 solid mh/slow swords in between Trash Blade and Dal Rends/Krol that unfortunately apply a debuff to the target which make them unusable for raids. I wouldn't say Blizzard *ignored* 1h sword itemization. They just failed to consider the impact of putting a debuff on a weapon in regards to raid optimization.
---
Lies. He knew.
---
Never trust a sell sword.
---
Horde would never do this, there is no HONOR in this!
---
Imagine not using scroll wheel
---
That's not gonna happen.
---
Eat my ass
---
It‚Äôs VC.
---
It's nothing fancy, something like:
---
\#showtooltip Whirlwind  
---
/cast Berserker Stance  
---
/equip "weapon"  
---
/cast Whirlwind
---
Now that you mention it this probably doesn't work, the only reason it "works" for me is my WW-macro button in defensive stance is the same for WW in berserker stance (the 4 key). So when I'm spamming like an idiot WW will eventually cast once GCD is up, then I hop back into defensive.
---
If you need help editing, hit me up. Sounds likd a fun project :)
---
[You in that ZF](https://gfycat.com/soggythirstybluebreastedkookaburra)
---
No screenshot = gtfo.
---
VC to me always makes me think of Wailing Caverns. DM is deadmines and Dire Maul is Dire Maul.
---
...and chain banishing Garr's midgets
---
Is there a way to remove poisons from rogue weapons? I am a shaman and my friend plays a rogue and routinely we have to wait out the poison timer before he can benefit from Windfury totem.
---
I know in retail you could just right click the buff, but that doesn't appear to work in classic.
---
Important distinction: the 5-second timer starts when you *spend mana*, not when you begin a cast.
---
In other words you can cancel a cast and it will not affect this regeneration period.
---
Was a joke, but it's not that weird... Consider that people didn't start right when it came out. Consider people have other obligations, like work, family, school, SO, vacations, etc. Consider that all time spent playing isn't time spent leveling. There's a lot of time where I'm crafting, or fishing, or just hanging out with friends, leveling alts, etc.
---
What the fuck is the thought process here? Almost every decision you made was wrong
---
I thought you had to either destroy your hearthstone or have it be on cooldown for Stuck to kill you?
---
You can also ask the local Paladin or Druid to use his BIS to handle them.
---
from what I hear all mobs in MC is immune to it, I know guys who has used it for several raids without ever seeing the debuff.
---
Also here's a comment from vanilla
---
By [**Anonymous**](https://classicdb.ch/?user=Anonymous) [on 07/04/2005](https://classicdb.ch/?item=17071#comments:id=2647766) (Patch 1.5.1)
---
I've had this dagger for a couple weeks now, and you don't need to $%\^&amp;\* about its debuff taking up slots in MC.&amp;nbsp It appears all the mobs in MC are immune to its debuff, thanks blizzard!&amp;nbsp However the proc/debuff works wonders in general pve/pvp =\].
---
Have fun in MC with this dagger rogues!
---
Any tips where I should grind my last 1.5 levels to 60? I only have dungeon quests in my log and finished plaguelands, un goro, felwood and winterspring. I'm a dagger rogue playing mostly solo and in short bursts so hard to do dungeons
---
Class Fantasy, whichever one you enjoy/relate to the most.
---
I only completed Darkshore fully, that zone is insanely good to get from 14 to 20! It‚Äôs one of those few zones that left me that impression of many levels per zone kinda thing like in modern WoW.
---
Yes, but it DOES require more dedication.   
---
Your average player that's used to retail probably aren't going to do the super-long quest chains or do things the long/hard way if its "not efficient".   
---
In Classic, if you want nice things, you have to go out of your way to get them. Every player shouldn't be given some "ez mode button" to fly through end-game content without having to work their asses off for that button first
---
You don‚Äôt farm for BOE epics lmao. Keep us posted if you find it
---
We're playing on 1.12, you won't be able to bring corrupted blood out of ZG.
---
Ummmmm no.
---
1 - (1 - 0.04)74 = 0.9512
---
So there‚Äôs about a 5% chance that you still don‚Äôt see the sword drop after 74 runs.
---
4% is 4%, each time.  You‚Äôve just had shit luck 73 times in a row.
---
Yes, the debuff has the same priority as things like Deep Wounds (low) and will not push off anything with higher priority (Sunder, Faerie, etc)
---
Im like 80% sure this is how it works in classic
---
Actionbar addon??
---
What's your WW macro? Weapon swapping causing GCD made me unsure if it's worth it.
---
Yeah, I do this a decent amount. Not too much, because it's tough for me to keep track of mentally, but it's great for stockpiling "for later use".
---
I am spacing arms so I can get better crits, so is the 5 in fury.  I am seeing the rest in prot to get better threat and lesser points by under armour and taunt.
---
What‚Äôs arcane missiles? Cause that‚Äôs my plan for a mage.
---
After 40, I just respecced Mace and bought Writ's Third Leg (3g) and Mug O' Hurt (5g). Much better than using bad swords.
---
Close to 48, I caved in and bought a Bloodrazor(32g) on my realm. It's 100% worth it if you can get it for cheap.
---
Get your hands at a Hanzo Sword (28g) as soon as you can at 50. Start looking for it in the at. If it's below 30g, it's worth it, in my opinion.
---
see thats the thing. I am ~~going to pvp~~ pvping at 60. Porque no los dos? You are stupid because you pretend to know the inner working of a reddit strangers mind. lol.
---
I'm not sure about that, but maybe someone else has the answer. What I know for sure is that it applies to all 3 schools of magic, not only arcane.
---
i alllllllways forget about blind. i use gouge so much when i feel like really blind should be priority over it..
---
it's an offhand, Thrash Blade is mainhand despite what OP says
---
Thanks for sharing your diary entry for today!

1h sword progression is nearly identical. And if you don't mind using a 1h Mace, there are a few options as well (especially if you have the balls to roll against casters). And daggers are out there as well. 
---
WC: Wing Blade
---
BFD: Outlaw
---
SM: Sword of Omen (also healer mace in SM Cath)
---
RFD: Vanquisher
---
ZF has a couple swords and as well as a good, slow mace.
---
Mara: Thrash.
---
UBRS: Dal Rends (there are some other options you can grab that apply debuffs).
---
There's also a boe blue sword between BFD and SM that requires level ~29 and has a 2.8 attack speed. I got it for a few gold in the AH. Can't remember the name but it helps fill that awkward gap.
---
Yeah, I heard about arms specs tanking dungeons. I considered doing that, but decided to put most points in the prot tree just to get a feel for it. Now I have talent points spread across all specs. I'm just picking and choosing what I think increases the most threat, while occasionally going with damage additions.
---
I fully expect to respec at a certain point just to do it right. For now, it's fun just throwing shit at the wall and seeing what sticks.
---
A lot of people won't like hearing I play like this. It's certainly not the most efficient way to do things, but I enjoy the process and find it rewarding.
---
It‚Äôs so garbage. Please join fight club discord and don‚Äôt make builds yourself if you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing
---
Even small things like profession windows get the exact same keybinds with me lol
---
Silverdragon kind of does that. I don't know exactly the mechanics of how it works, but it will make a sound and put a diamond mark over rare spawns that you can see. It doesn't do anything like scanning a whole zone or anything like that, you have to be able to see it, but it may help you.
---
It's called a discussion. Thanks for making your daily lack worthy contribution for the day!
---
I usually ask to join the group, and let the 60 loot everything (except the quest items I might need). Or try to out-tag them
---
Wasn't me, I in fact will probably install the addon.

Is this some Retail-speak that I'm too Classic to understand?

I mean, I could see why you couldn't backSTAB with a fist weapon, but no backSTAB with a sword... really?
---
Hahaha this guy gets it. Amen brotha!
---
Thanks for the reply, although that worked for you I don‚Äôt think it will for me. My brother is on the same network at the house yet he doesn‚Äôt have these issues?
---
Thanks for your answer. My guild has it banned though so I don't know if they have been misinformed or they are right and it is usable with 8cap debuff and unusable with 16cap debuff
---
Yeah that exists because servers like mine (Stalagg) were massively populated with horde 70:30 horde/alliance ratio and the horde gank you where ever you go in packs of 5-10.  So naturally all the alliance were fed up and left. I wanted to leave, but I started a guild with like 10+ friends and we're actually clearing all of the endgame content so, we decided to stay.  Now horde outnumber alliance by what seems like at least 80:20 and going to BRM is just done corpse running, from the second you land on the FP til you reach the instance portal horde just corpse camp you in groups.  No clue why the horde feel the need to be dicks to a faction they outnumber so drastically and gank in such unfair conditions, but I guess that's just kinda what horde do. I can guarantee horde on Heartseeker have it easier than alliance on Stalagg.
---
Whitemane the og.

I assumed he was referring to the escort

The viability of dual wielding depends on your attack power. Dual wielding inherently gets a 150% (163% talented) benefit from AP compared to 2handers, though the latter gets a couple of points back from 2h specialization. In addition, big AP allows you to use heroic strike more often, negating the dual wielding miss penalty. Dreadforge relatiator also gets no benefit from your racial, so thrash blade+? will most likely outperform it with buffs.
---
&gt;At what point in gearing does dual wield overtake 2H (minus a BRE)?
---
I don't know the precise point, but dual wielding is better single target dps by the time you're close to prebis. I encourage you to simulate it yourself. The fight club spreadsheet is a good starting point, though trusting it blindly is not advisable.
---
its even worse when that person is in your guild.
---
what gloves?? lol
---
I am talking big raidvraid type of encounters. I play lock so I'm not biassed. Mages Excell at jumping into a big crowd doing damage, applying slow, and inciting overall confusion all relatively safely. We decisively won several raidvraid encounters last night mostly due to our mages. 
---
As a lock with no movement abilities, trying to initiate with a fear is extremely risky. I honestly felt like the only thing I could really do was harrass with dots. I am sure hunters would fare better, but no raid leader is going to say, "hunters initiate every one follow".
---
In a similar vein, people are always like "WHY ZEVRA NO DROP HOIVES WHEN HAS FOUR." and I just assume that most zevra hooves are beat to hell from walkin the plains all day and the guy wants hooves in good condition.
---
I dont think this removes the spawns, you are just so far away that the spawns dont have enough time to get to you before the boss dies.
---
Combat rogue is way more useful for BG pvp than dagger specs. Dagger specs are built around 1v1 ganking scenarios.
---
On BGs is better to be a pressure dmg monster
---
No. It is unfortunate that the quest mobs are also the ones that drop what they may "NEED" for whatever reason. But mobs are equal opportunity.  I was farming in fellwood for water essence and I had no idea they were quest mobs till I saw a 55 come by and start killing them. I whispered I'd buy any essences off of him and he was like, just here for the quest.
---
Damnnn. That is ideal.
---
non-unique too
---
Very atmospheric for a dungeon about discovering artifacts and lore
---
Just interrupt. So like a normal mount plus spell school lockout. Not really a likely scenario
---
Who the hell says DM T. OG is always Trib or king run.
---
All very good to hear and get confirmed. These were basically my thoughts on fire and arcane because I remember them actually being good in BC, yet they seem underpowered and less loved right now
---
I'm not agreeing with the comment, it contributed nothing and he was being a dick, but I think that argument is based on a fallacy...
---
Do you have to be a director to dislike a movie? Do you have to be a cook to dislike food? Etc. I don't think you have to be better at that thing to provide feedback, there's just a good and bad way to do it
---
What's fortnight
---
How do you type all that and not realize the real way to optimize that situation is to just wait longer to cast your large heal? Topping off with small heals when you have no +healing just means you're regenning less mana with the 5 second rule
---
Thank you for confirming what I said.
---
Bigger than you'd think.  They're both games that have broken out of their genre.   For many wow players wow is the only mmo they've ever played.
---
Dude, I'm not advertising my build, I am asking people to see if it's a good idea to spec like this.
---
Emberseer always died like a trash mob.
---
I wish I only needed that many buttons
---
Can someone eli5 the difference between spirit regeneration, and mana per 5 regeneration
---
The second one. 15 healing &gt; 4 int and  5 spirit
---
There is nothing wrong with having one interest, either.
---
Same here. I see all this mage hate and it‚Äôs just that there are so many people that don‚Äôt play their role in a group. My first concern is not taking aggro from the tank. While leveling AoE specs readily break that rule. 
---
There is a time and place for the AoE spec and during leveling is not that place.
---
I'll settle this once and for all.
---
Tanks SHOULD be able to hold aggro no matter what. If you cant, then you are trash and shouldn't be tanking.
---
just run around WPL killing bats is good if your just wasting time for gold
---
I thought Whitemane was the only choice... who could deny those thighs.
---
twitch.tv/roxefeller
---
Pulls were from Saturday. That‚Äôs the OT perspective
---
Not really, if you're mounting up you're already needing to travel for longer than the five second rule will matter.
---
I mean.  If you don't worry about best in slot gear then no worries.  But if you do, there will probably be a slot or two that you'll be able to upgrade in DM compared to stuff available today.
---
It's irony made of graphite, that's why.
---
I just bandage and eat and keep pulling.
---
I tried this in Cata I think it was, died in the mid 40s. Even in that easier game state, Rogue was rough in Ironman mode. Well done!
---
I mean I will be playing fortnite when it does release but the only reason is because my wife loves the game and I have fun playing with her. WoW isn't her style.
---
Why does retail need to die, just don't play it.
---
&gt; a conversation or debate about a certain topic
---
Yeah chief, none of which applies to this thread. 
---
If retail dies, Classic will likely go down with it. Classic, for all its glory, is not as economically feasible as retail. Retail gets a cash boost every couple of years from expansion releases, Classic does not/will not. Retail gets value-added services like character transfers, race changes, and faction swaps, Classic does not. Retail makes Blizzard a lot of money, Classic does not.
---
Classic has certainly gotten a lot of people to resubscribe, certainly. Having Classic is better than *not* having Classic when it comes to monthly subscription income. But it's not the cash cow that retail is. And it never will be, because that literally defeats the purpose of Classic. I'm certain that they'll eventually proceed to TBC and Wrath Classic servers, because those expansions were super-popular (more popular than Vanilla was), but not because retail "dies." It'll be instead because retail lives on to finance Classic, which despite its gains will only ever be more of a side project as far as the bigwigs are concerned.
---
As for Vulpera, if you don't like them, *don't play them*. If you don't like retail, *don't play retail*. If you don't have anything nice to say, *shut the hell up*. You don't see retail players going on about how goddamn ugly some of the Vanilla-era classic in-game models are (which they are, to be fair), probably because they're too busy flying around on high-poly mounts, working on their rep to unlock small fuzzy people or something. You don't have to like the same things everyone else likes, you don't have to "follow the crowd," you don't have to play retail if you don't like it. But the least you could do is be a decent human being and not trash people for doing what they like.
---
This isn't true for  certain events. The BRD torch example is a good one.
---
Also make sure you are using the last rank scorpid sting, any other ranks will not work.
---
- Basilisks in STV or shimmering flats
---
- silithid in shimmering flats
---
- swamp jaguars in swamp of sorrows
---
- lesser rock elementals in Badlands
---
Those are all good choices. A lot of people kill the elementals though so it may not be as productive as the other spots. Also, the basilisks and jaguars are much better if you have skinning.
---
I've been MC'ed off of spots where fatigue kills you before you can get back to land as Horde. I rather just get ganked than MC'ed off the damn boat.
---
It is a world drop mate, meaning it can drop on any monster in the level range at any time. You are farming for nothing but golds
---
Deadmines is 16+ preferably 18+
---
First aid trainers will teach you new things as your level gets high enough.  All the bandage types go from "X" bandage, to Heavy "X" bandage, with X being the type of cloth used.  From weakest to strongest they go linen, wool, silk, mageweave, then finally to runecloth.  Recipes from linen to silk bandage are from first aid trainers in the major cities.  Heavy silk and mageweave bandages are from manuals that are sold by specific quest givers, then you need to complete a quest to learn aritisan first aid.  After that quest is complete you can purchase the heavy mageweave, runecloth, and heavy runecloth bandages from artisan first aid trainers.
---
Dead Mines: 18-21
---
Everyone is in IF. Whitemane is packed
---
Isn't thrash blade main had only?
---
It is not.
---
&gt; It's disliked because it's different, due to people actually having a difference in opinion that greatly differs from it.
---
Yeah bro, your anti-retail opinion sure is a bold one around these parts.
---
What a riot.
---
I honestly couldnt imagine suffering through this lol, then again I try to only go with guildies.
---
This is pretty much entirely dependent on your servers economy. If you look at a leveling guide they should have a complete list of needed mats. You can then sit at the AH and do some maths
---
I dont know which weapon you SHOULD use, but my advice would be (until max/bis anyway) to use a fast weapon OH. if youre going to miss alot of the time, might as well have a fast speed. I used a dagger (cant remember the name, was a 1.3 sec speed) for most of my 40s and low 50s until I recently got Tooth of eranikus, which I am now using MH and thrash blade OH.
---
Its pretty balanced IMO, so its hard to tell without having played both sides.  I know though that theres plenty of ganking on both ends for sure.
---
Here's the deal.
---
Once you ding 40, respec to full shadow to get shadowform. Shadowform + shadow weaving + shadow dmg talent = up to 35% more dmg!
---
Regarding your rotation: trash that dies quickly, just mind flayx2 then mind blast.
---
On packs? SwP everything, then mind blast/mind flay main target.
---
Holy fire should be removed from your bar. You should have two ranks of mind flay. Use that instead.
---
While solo: You should be trying to manage your mama. Shield yourself, mind blast pull, mind flayx2, mind blast, wand.
---
Look at getting shadoweave items asap.
---
Honestly just progressing. Im worried I'll be bored once I hit 60 since that's max level. How hype you get when you get a piece of sweet new gear. First toon and been loving the ride.
---
The mechanics of tanking are not hard, there's no real class mechanics in vanilla that are hard. If you read a guide/watch some videos you'll see what to do and when.
---
It's the social experience of knowing how you want to do something but having other members of your group ignore you and do their own thing. Sometimes it's fine and like you said you can just leave the mage to kite the mobs he pulled or the rogue to solo the mob he is dpsing away from everyone else that you were trying to los pull but other times you have a bad experience where those guys will try and blame you and rage. 
---
Tanking isn't hard, the people you have to deal with while doing it can be the frustrating part.
---
Yea I'm sorry but you have no idea what you are talking about. You've played with very bad warriors and don't know a think about tanking.
---
 Definition of **positor**. : one that posits especially : the person making a statement or providing a segment of information ‚Äî compare proband.   
---
You posited a statement my guy.
---
&gt;I dont think I've ever seen someone wait to attack in a dungeon
---
... and this is exactly the problem. As a tank, your tank will thank you if you let him build a bit of threat.
---
Correct, and I have precision. I guess my main discussion revolves around if those 2 points in Arcane Subtlety outweigh the 2 points in Arcane Focus. Assuming you do not currently have BiS gear.
---
EDIT: I use Arcane Explosion right now while AoE farming, so it seems more useful UNLESS -10 resistance has more weight. I'm assuming some theorycrafter have run the tests.
---
a few seconds to pound out 20s per? easy money

Subject: "..."

unfortunately no, you can't bypass rattlegore with 305 LP. i only know this because i shelled out 5g(after all was said and done) to get these gloves made for me - no one seems to have the pattern - and then went to scholo - and it was still red. so no, 305 LP won't let you pick it. the outside door to DM north you can pick, but you can do that with 300LP. one of the inside doors in DM north you can pick, but not the one that you need the key out of the chest for. thanks, blizzard, for a basically useless item.
---
Hell yeah I did.
---
you ever done DM T?
---
This.  While there are definitely young people that play Classic I‚Äôm betting the Classic community is overall older in age and Fortnite is mostly aimed at kids/teenagers.
---
So let's look at your argument and see if it's extremely detrimental.
---
&gt;Puts you on GCD
---
That's irrelevant because if you're mounting, you're not going to be casting any spells 1 sec later.
---
&gt;Can be counterspelled
---
Doesn't matter, since any kind of attack or spell will prevent a normal mount cast anyway. This also means that a counterspell will *literally* prevent you from mounting a normal mount as well, just because it puts you in combat. 
---
&gt;Costs mana
---
It doesn't cost enough mana that it matters for the distance you'll need to travel to justify getting mounted in the first place.
---
So that's 0/3. If you've got more let me know.
---
Took that down quick...
---
I'm much faster in the capitals by using Kargath. Because there are always portal mages. And when I need to get to Blackrock because I found a group while fishing in Winterspring it is a lot faster that way.
---
Not wanting to sit around drinking is the opposite of lazy
---
Alright, I figured they had fixed it at some point but Ai distinctly remember reading patch notes stating it removed.
---
Yes, you are correct, the healer shouldn‚Äôt need 80% mana before every pull if everyone‚Äôs playing optimally. But here‚Äôs my hot take: it doesn‚Äôt matter if some people aren‚Äôt playing as well as others. 
---
Short of only running with friends/ your guild, you can‚Äôt control the ‚Äúgoodness‚Äù of your group. Some people are new, out of practice, or even just bad. Sometimes skilled players make mistakes. For me personally, I‚Äôd much rather slow the run down than wipe. That‚Äôs why I like a mana safety-net. 
---
You play how you like,  no objections to that, but you‚Äôre just being a dick because not everyone knows how to play yet.
---
I'm on Rattlegore-PVP. It's usually high pop. A bit heavy on Horde, but seems to be balancing out.
---
You know how?
---
I‚Äôve been trying to set up a reliable chrome remote fishing station, and a keybound saved camera angle is the missing piece!
---
I don't.  There's an alternative.  I have Details! installed.  It's a damage meter which includes TinyThreat as a plugin.  Works great and not everyone has to have it installed, just need to turn on advanced combat logging so it can estimate based on party/raid member damage output.
---
Didn't settle anything. How is it that you're an authority on tanking, when you don't even know the basics.
---
Enjoy it, do whatever is fun, don't let people ruin your experience telling you how to play.
---
&gt;  How much gold will it cost to drop herb and level engineering to 300 at 60?  
---
A fortune.

Leveling 200-300 would require 160 Mithril Bars and 183 Thorium Bars.
---
P.S. Dropping herb is free, btw)

How many elemental fire are you receiving per hour without competition?
---
Haha that guy Luxus is in my guild
---
Totally agree. I'm more than happy to play with newbies, in fact I love helping out and giving advice.
---
But this was presented as a sort of *rule*, which I thing is wrong (and it seems like you agree). Waiting on everyone to have full mana, especially mages, is just wasting time and resources.
---
Looking good! What else are you using? And is it possible to export your setup?
---
l2r
---
I am confused too. And this is not the first time ive seen someome write like that
---
When you wipe in a raid (at least when we did in Vanilla), we would all unequip our weapons so they wouldn't break.
---
You gotta have other characters with other crafting profs to feed your enchanter, tailoring skinning on one and skinning LW on another, give all the leather to the LW, make greens with the tailor and LW and DE with the enchanter. 
---
It's a bit of work but if you love alts like I do it makes enchanting actually profitable because mats have no deposit on the AH.
---
stunning mobs that use shield wall is also very benefitial
---
Probably should crop out your character name/turn off UI for these.  Blizzard doesnt come down hard on people usually but sometimes they frown upon this sort of thing and you can get in trouble.
---
Could you ever see that in the base client?
---
I would put the axe in the off hand then, faster weap in off hand
---
20 to 30
---
&gt; The more that the mods allow low effort posts the more people will post low effort posts. Stop having them appear on the front page and you'll decrease the supply of the posts as well.
---
This might be true if:
---
1. People followed the posting rules.
---
2. Reported posts were taken down near-instantly, as in some subs with an automod bot.
---
At normal server restart that happen every week at Tuesday.  
---
Just this time they will do a patch.
---
Dedicated. Couldn't imagine what that 42 was like. I just passed that mark the other day and I've been ganked and killed so many times
---
Seriously, I‚Äôve gone full arcane missles. Level 35 casual having a blast. Why did I do this? Because it looks cool as fuck and I got sick of mobs hitting my casting bar back with every attack.
---
Why would you need to use the AH if you can only use greys and whites and have no professions?
---
edit: selling, i suppose, but I almost never do that, lol.
---
Many enemies cannot swim. You can use this to force mobs to evade and reset in dungeons. Similar if you can stand on something that causes mobs to evade.
---
As good of a thread to vent about this as any - but my entire day was ruined to hell yesterday by a piece of shit 60 rogue in Felwood on Kurinaxx. He killed me 5 times.  
---
...why? I'm a 51 priest.There's nothing i can do, I have zero chance to win. How is this fun after 1-2 kills for anyone who isn't some combination of really bad and a total asshole? Once is fine (it's a pvp server after all I know what I signed up for)...hell I'll even give a rogue two kills before I get pissed. You've proved your dominance, red is dead, etc etc and your general level of dickhead by two kills of someone 9 levels lower than you. But 5 times? Come on dawg, what the fuck is wrong with you? 
---
On a side note - I have yet to have a single horde of equal level (or within 1-2 levels) attack me in a 1v1 scenario. This has literally never happened from 1 to now 52. It's always either 2+ people or someone 5+ levels higher. 99% of people on pvp servers are huge pussies who don't know the first thing about pvp. End of rant.
---
Lol, summons are so useful doe. What‚Äôs the etiquacy for healing a warlock. I‚Äôve had locks straight up just tap tap tap and never drink, expecting healer to heal. What‚Äôs the consensus?
---
Both systems are garbage and why I quit classic originally, bring back good purchasable pvp gear for gods sake. I don't like the lottery personal loot in retail either, not nearly as exciting to get loot
---
You build all of the unique items you want from gnomish and re learn to goblin. You keep everything you made from gnomish.
---
I don't get why zevhra hooves are the poster child for low drop rates anyway. It takes like 10 kills to get the 4 hooves
---
Now Helcular's Rod, *that's* a hard quest item to find
---
Fire is better dps. Only reason people dont run fire right now is because everything is immune to firee
---
Why the hell would blizzard intervene?  Just skip the quest, do it when the guy isn't online, or get friends/guildies to help.
---
I do! It‚Äôs under the keybind options in the camera section. There are presets there
---
Anything you do to make gold is gonna be time consuming so best to just spend that time doing quests/dungeons, gaining xp and gold from those.  Personally I stopped buying skill upgrades for a couple levels to save up.
---
wow no mention of Fairbanks. That's where I am. Apart from Whitemane, it would be the highest pop west coast server. Very good community from my experience so far.
---
Literally just think of it this way: the fist 5 weapon skill is 3% hit and like a 10-20% damage boost depending on glancing blow RNG. Yes, edgemasters will beat basically everything else, but only while fighting targets 3 levels above you.
---
LMAO, I'm four day /played lvl 60 mage with full BiS in a top 10 guild in classic. Nice try, pal. Fire mages do not destroy frost mages at anything except DPS end game when you can stack scorch ignite.  
---
Jesus, Reddit and their idiocy today.
---
Not to mention when you try and reserve something as a tank like greens or first orb in Strat there's always that guy verbally attacking you for being greedy.
---
And then you have no one following your marks through the entire dungeon simeotaneously calling you bad. 
---
It's a sick job
---
I tried moving mine but Titan Panel keeps moving it back
---
Sounds like bad luck (or maybe the guilds on my server had good luck).  My guild on Shadowmoon had 2 complete TFs (the first went to the MT and the second went to a rogue).  The best guild on the server actually had 3 people with TFs by the time TBC came out.
---
What in the world are you talking about sap not being a good opener?  Its meant to hold you in position so that the Rogue doesnt have to scramble to get in position themselves.
---
People playing Classic definitely don't give a shit about that game.
---
Another thing you can do is pull him back to the little ramp, if a wipe is inevitable have someone with rez jump onto the cannon to the left. Bonus points if it's the healer, who can just chill there the entire fight
---
Anyone who has TrinketMenu working? I have seen it working on streams, but the menu wont show up for me, only the minimap thingy.
---
My guild does inverse Barron runs where the goal is to get the bomb and kill as many as possible.
---
Ravenguard messaged one of my bois back when we were leveling saying about how they had enjoyed grouping with us, thought we were cool, and were wondering if we were interested in doing a merge with their guild.
---
I talked to every single guild member of mine and ***not a single one of us*** had ever grouped with Ravenguard before...
---
I already did, it's the medical definition of posterior. However if you were going to call me an ass I'd expect you to not be such a pussy and say it out right.
---
OoF, sadly i dont have an epic mount, or mining, i do have herbalism and ive found quite a lot of dreamfoil, but thats about it, i thought you meant mobs and whatnot :(
---
I grinded the wildkin in winterspring for the last half a level or so. Decent exp and pretty good money at least as a warlock. The g/h depends largely on the price of giant eggs on your server, so if the price is low it may not be worth it but I made around 20-25g/h. Also if you do grind there the demand for giant eggs is limited so do not sell them all at once afterwards.
---
It's not "coming to defend my honor" I'm laughing at how ignorant people are, they can't beat the mage's DPS so they tell themselves "yeah it boring all they do is frostbolt" when it's one of the most dynamic and mobile classes in the game lol
---
I have level 100+ druid, paladin, warrior, priest, DH and mage on retail and none of them have the mobility and utility that mages do, Druids are about the closest.
---
Thanks, I‚Äôll try it out!
---
I like the skepticism. I side with you. The DM release came out of left field.
---
It's a debate.
---
It will do the most damage in Bear, but is far from the best tanking weapon.  Warden's staff is BiS for tanking.
---
I couldn't get the threat plugin for details addon to work... It just searches for some time then stops. What could be wrong here?
---
SM.

ü¶Ä Blizzard is powerless against the Chinese overlords ü¶Ä
---
I don't care what people call it, but just to be clear it's not the only dungeon based on a quest. No one argues about ST but that's a name from a quest, not the instance name.
---
blizzard is level 20, cone of cold is 26?, imp blizzard and permafrost are maxed at 22. This means you can have cold snap, imp blizzard, permafrost, and cone of cold at 26, which is easy enough to AOE with, especially on packs like the gnolls in the wetlands who are amenable to it.
---
he has a 50/50 chance every time he kills a patriarch, it either drops or it doesn't lol
---
it could, it just probably wont, but the great thing about this game is as long as you are having fun/enjoying yourself and not harming anyone else, there is no wrong way to play.
---
It absolutely applies more in raids. But it does still apply in parties.
---
You don't wait for your whole party to reach half health to run yourself out of mana because "it is more efficient", if you can top them off and regen that mana afterwards.
---
It is better to break your regen once and cast 3 heals, than break your regen 3 times to cast 1 heal as needed to cast "a more efficient heal". At that point there is an added cost of the regen you lost through breaking your regen multiple times, and it is more than the stated spell value.
---
It is almost like it is more complected than a sweeping "down ranking is a misconception." I highlighted that in the simplest way why it was not a misconception, because beyond that point it becomes far more nuanced, you know that I know that, but people that DON'T know that are going to read a post saying "Down ranking is a misconception" and follow ups by idiots saying "just wait longer" and since people here missed the fact that "it is more complicated than that" the randoms that are trying to learn absolutely are going to miss that and go with "I never down rank and wait until!"
---
agreed got my girlfriend to start playing WoW, unfortunately the shit laptop I bought broke day 2-3 as in shit the bed while trying ti play WoW but worked flawlessly no lags day 1 and 2, But, I didn't want to overwhelm her and all addons iput were Questie so she knew where to go she was saying "its weird im done and now where do I go" I had to tell her 3 times to go back to the quest giver haha
---
So questie was a solid addition and then I put vendor price on there because she knew the "if I cant use either of the items get the most expensive one" tactic
---
I'm bill gates.

---
Never said you had to. Said you‚Äôd be a twat if you came up and sniped a unique quest mob that someone was actively clearing other mobs in order to make a safe pull on. You‚Äôd be a twat by deny their group invite. You‚Äôd be in fact slowing their progress, again, making you a twat.
---
Oh do you need me to break it down phase by phase and raid tier by raid tier for you?
---
That's a wall of text. Thanks for taking the time to share. If it was smaller I'd probably read it hehe
---
I'm mad for u
---
It doesn't take a blizz employee to understand that implementing an artificial queue would do nothing but hurt the games image even further. People just REALLY enjoy reaching as far as they can on these things lol.
---
I never said I could, you'll never see a video of me doing this lol. I don't play Rogues, I just know about them from my own research / memory from back in vanilla playing one to like lvl 40 or something / the memes we're making about Rogues near daily.
---
It does sound impossible, but watch some streams or on youtube. I already watched this one guy who's 60 now, but I watched him when he was like lvl 40 taking down 44-45 alliances as an undead rogue. It's entirely possible, but again, when they're such a higher level and you get missed and dodged at every turn, it takes a lot longer to kill, but is doable. Especially when the opponent sucks at the game/panicks.
---
Me too would love it

You may like the cold but I enjoy the K A B O O M

I‚Äôm combat sword spec and I don‚Äôt get why people call it boring. Yes your main combo point builder is sinister strike, but when you‚Äôre dagger spec that just switches to backstab. Otherwise I‚Äôm doing a lot more than pressing one button. Bad combat rogues just build to 5 combo points and burn eviscerate. If they know what they‚Äôre doing, they‚Äôll be a lot more creative and do a lot more damage.

I wasn‚Äôt going to use my voidwalker much tbqh and figured I would level with imp but once I finished my quest for him and saw his name I did a 180

Listen to this guy. 
---
Having a warlock mount in pvp will not cause any handicap at all. 
---
I mean... walking half a second when buffing after rez will never make any effective difference in a pvp fight. 
---
Pvp fights are won with strategy, preparation and skill, not ridiculous micro min/maxing of half a gcd or +- 100 mana when mounting up.
---
I do now!
---
It only gets more expensive as time goes on. Asked some guys a few weeks ago and they said 60g now it‚Äôs like 100g+

Well hes a tank... he can run any instance he wants and have a fully formed group in less than 3 minutes. (Source: i have a tank set and run whatever i want)
---
You could spend a day farming a Krol Blade, pair it with a mirah's song and do damage comparable to Dal Rend set.
---
With normal to bad RNG it can take ages to SEE a set, let alone win the roll on both.
---
Speaking as a rogue who bought Krol after about 25 rend runs without seeing MH or OH a single time.
---
I'm a hunter and honestly my server is filled with noobs,  I outtag them a couple times then they give up

Look up the fight club classic warrior discord. They have a spreadsheet which includes prebis and bis stuff for orcs/humans/other races.

iirc they have rivenspike and bone slicing hatchet as what you should use.

I don‚Äôt know what phrases hunters say, but as a warrior I‚Äôm imagining her first words would be ‚ÄòI need more rage‚Äô ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt do that yet‚Äô if she‚Äôs spending a lot of time with you while you play lol
---
What gear has your MT being using for ony? Any fire resistance?
---
Ethernet cable. Have you tried other cables? Other ports on the router?
---
Ah, cool, glad you're not actually interested in "discussion" at all like you said you were earlier, you're just another shitposter ineptly trying to stir the pot. I'll just block you and move on. If you ever get that hate boner out of your own ass, it won't be my problem.
---
For 99% of stuff: 0
---
For Baron Geddon: As much as you can stack (150+), ignore everything else (fr &gt; stam etc)
---
For Fire packs after geddon + Ragnaros: As much as you can stack (150+) but do NOT ignore armor/stamina/etc. Rag hits with combination of fire and physical, so dont just put on volcanic gear etc.
---
We counted them all up when this came out - Warrior tanks can get over 60 possible auras.   It‚Äôs a lot of stuff that you don‚Äôt think of - priest and shaman armor buffs, blood rage, berserker rage, enrage, flurry, war stance, shield block, HoTs... there‚Äôs a lot of stuff that counts towards the 32-aura limit.

Wands are not spells. It's not a bug that they don't get affected by spell damage.

As a druid tank, I want to be able to throw a big healing touch on you immediately after combat so I can shift back to bear and keep going. Tap toward the end of the fight but before everything dies.

Hmm, I don‚Äôt feel that word quite works in that sentence.

(I get what you‚Äôre saying though)

Yeh, that‚Äôs what I did to make this slower one. I think it‚Äôs actually better than the original faster one that I posted.

Minimum for healing or dos, 17. Tank, at least 19 I'd say. 20 if you're a paladin, cant tank without consc.

Yeah later on i even had my owl tank as a hunter, i was probably lvl 21 or 22?
---
Except those are extremely infrequent downsides- unless you're getting attacked by another player in the 1.5 seconds that you're mounting, they're pretty much irrelevant. It's likely you'll get significantly better overall results just buying better gear with the couple hundred gold you can potentially save getting the dreadsteed over a race mount than you'd ever get by having a different mount.
---
12 Leaky? Dafuq?

No, I typically don‚Äôt wear any FR. Usually a combination of mitigation + hit/threat gear.

The breath is her only ability that hits hard, just need to be topped off for it.

If you're skipping Shadowform on purpose then you're better off going Disc or Holy and hitting things with Smite.

I AoE farm at 60 for money while having shatter and the last 5pointer, so full single target damage. You can have both, just farm with CoC and Flamestrike
---
Here is a an overall list for all dungeons with level ranges and links to detailed guides. 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-dungeons-overview
---
He a word.
---
And? 
---
How does this prevent you from farming, ride around on your epic mount in a loop, hit some rocks pick some flowers. Boom you have over 50g/hour.
---
It's not that hard at all
---
Maybe on servers that are still 100% full.   
---
Most people horde on DD aren't into doing strat and it's practically all LBRS/UBRS and Scholo runs. Even with a tank forming a full group can take up to an hour
---
eew
---
i agree, loot is just less exciting, and its pure RNG what youll get. Best system was having pvp gear purchasable so people can't just outgear me and win and idc about pve gear.
---
You can run to another graveyard, can't you?
---
On a scale of 1 to "frostbolt" how butthurt are you when you look at your DPS meter?
---
I have always played fire and thats my go to spec in classic also. Although I'm only lvl 37. Not sure if I'm going to raid though, might just stick to wpvp.
---
Looking for someone to reroll and level with. Pref Smolderweb horde or Benediction alliance. Typically play a couple hours per day, sometimes less.
---
Pally tanking is based off threat generated by holy damage. So more damage = more threat.
---
Long as you dont die. And dont go oom. It should work.
---
Those early dungeons are for learning how to do the things you need to do in groups, the people you were grouping with were at fault. Not you. You did the right thing by letting everyone know and asking for advice.
---
Good point. If you know where one is.  Don‚Äôt think they are marked
---
Correct. Try to get a pet the same level (will do more damage) and look up pet talents and the respective levels. A pet might have a new rank of claw etc at a certain level - so its worth going and taming a pet with this so you receive the pet talent and can retrain
---
Or if the mods would enforce the rules.
---
Let's compare.  You a mage, can control when you cast Blizzard and other aoe spells.  Me, a healer, have no control on what mages I have in the group nor when they cast.
---
So, for you to say that my experience is anecdotal when I've had the range of mages when your comparison is your little old self, something is a bit off.
---
I'm not complaining about healing.  I'm complaining about mages who think aoe is the only spell they have.  Those mages exhaust my mana and when I go oom, the party wipes.  I'm already maximizing my class to its fullest with 5sr, potions, and drinking.  I can't stop stupid.
---
Like 90% of all names are in violation of that rule. It is very awkward, but sometimes you come across a name that's just too good.
---
All the issues you come up with are covered by DKP systems, I feel like you have never been in a good guild that uses DKP otherwise you would know these are none issues.

---
Best is ‚ÄòFishing‚Äô on 2
---
Priorities! 
---
I guess this is the reason why you‚Äôre studying all the waters of Feralas
---
How is it hardest? Healers want in for BIS chest, mages for hat, tanks for ring, physical DPS for cloak. It's pretty balanced in that regard
---
So you love latinas do you?
---
Arc hud?
---
Happened in my first run. I was really dumb and thought  I can just jumped out if it and I just walked in

You should hold some free action potions on u when u anticipate a rogue gank, just pop one

---
And then blink away in to the night.
---
They're do it. Oh you mean in game..
---
You know this was an over simplification. I know this was an over simplification.
---
Other people reading this are not going to recognize that a comment of "Downranking is a misconception" is a massive over simplification.
---
Bad healers while leveling leads to bad healers at 60. Down ranking is still an important tool to use at lower levels. You will always have other people to heal, and at some point you have to heal them. It is rarely the tank healing that drains mana, but rather the healing of other party members on difficult pulls or pulls that go haywire that drain mana, and you don't always have the luxury of just waiting so you ONLY cast your most efficient heal. You take the mana savings when you can.
---
But from the beginning you don't spread information that is inaccurate. "Down ranking is a misconception." is inaccurate information in a lot of healing scenarios. Hence the reason why I brought up an example of an easily understood scenario as to why downranking matters, because the game isn't in a vacuum, you don't always get to play 100% optimally to what a spreadsheet says, and sometimes the BEST heal IS NOT the most efficient heal.
---
In the same way almost no classes flash cast is the most efficient heal, but sometimes you just got to use it.
---
There is a reason why I used a specific example rather than some broad generalization that could be misconstrued.
---
It works fine if you have a decent healer just like arms 2hand tanking.
---
He won‚Äôt get good exp, but you can run him through dungeons to get him good gear for leveling.
---
I think that's it yeah. Is there a working version?
---
Come to Smoulderweb. Best first day decision I ever made.
---
That‚Äôs not what I just got.
---
https://i.imgur.com/xz3a1Oy.jpg
---
Does this happen on every server? What is with Rogues and putting stab in their name?
---
That‚Äôs what makes shaman tank viable. Shitload of threat from rockbiter and earth shock
---
&gt;If you create a country *where anyone is free to join and under no duress to stay, and have plenty of options to leave* and say, kicking little kids as an adult was allowed *but the kids can leave whenever they want, because they're free to choose and under no duress*, would you go "go kick them little kids"? Cause just cause it's allowed doesn't mean it doesn't make you a dickbag.
---
I made your comparison more accurate. And honestly, yeah. If me and the kids sign up for a butt kicking competition, I'm gonna kick their butts. If they don't like it, they can sign up for a different competition. Some people like competition, there are whole multi-billion dollar sports around it
---
Well, that's the thing, how often do you know you're going up against a mage?
---
It‚Äôs not quite that easy.  I‚Äôm running mages and an elite will straight up skull fuck one of your mages before they can explode him down.  Non elites, you can AE easily but you‚Äôre limited to a few or your mage will get murdered.
---
Cool! What are the recommended levelling pets? Just turned level 11, night elf hunter. I'm gonna be doing mostly quests and grinding. Thanks in advance.
---
Yeah the thought lingers. This is my first real incursion into PvP so I am just going to assume I'll be endlessly farmed. At least I've got my macro that lets the Horde know I love their moms. Its all I got for the gankers.
---
Sounds like depression.
---
They dont work in pvp, agaisnt 1-59, against level 60 only +1 bonus reduces glancing blows, full +7 effect only on mobs 62+, for orc and human they have full +7 effect only on 63 mobs. They are very situational bis.
---
[big fan of the Kindergarten Cop reference ](https://youtu.be/dp043py-Rqs)
---
I dont know a ton about Paladin healing so this may be different for them.
---
That's true but also it's 2019 and you can just look it up.
---
Well, that's why I said "as authentic as *possible*". Obviously they can't recreate the game experience completely as it was, unless they invent an actual time-machine.
---
Haha good idea.
---
I don‚Äôt get it. Hunters need them.
---
Would be funny if he says that then a purge spec enhance shaman one shots him and he rages.
---
In my experience people with "noob" and nearly any connotation of "slayer" in their name tend to be pretty bad against people who can pull their own weight.
---
Can attest to this. Guy at card shop when they had computers was raiding MC back when vanilla first came out and let me play his mage. Said to shoot frost bolt and if I got the bomb on geddon to ice block. I took 6th in dps and that was my first time playing wow.
---
I've been saving sill so I can learn talioring just for this, will drop straight after.

Ironically, that's basically the look of what I wore in Morrowind until becoming the Archmage of the Mages Guild.

And that wasn't nearly enough to describe how utterly useless conversing in any capacity is with you.

Everyone is living in L/UBRS and Scholo on my server. There was a huge group that rushed to 60 and farmed it until they got what they needed and now everyone else who's slowly making it up to 60 ends up in the L/UBRS / Scholo runs.   
---
a lot of people end up advertising for strat for upwards of an hour or two on my server.

Ghost Wolf and Travel form should be buffed to be as good as a mount

Lol???? Thanks for the laugh xD

Not always stab but something having to do with killing lmao. Saw a guy the other day named "SlashnGash". Really cool name bro

I read as if there was a missing "take".

This might be it.

I asked in chat for a crusader enchant, I got 2 whispers one said ‚ÄúI can do that for you friend ^^ ‚Äú the other said ‚Äú15g+ your mats‚Äù .

I messaged the first guy, and tipped him 20g because he was nice and not demanding.

I'd they're lvl 58, THEYRE OBVIOUSLY LOOKING FOR DEADMINES RUNS OK?

Huh i remember seeing that torch, clicking on it and seeing it turn and then have nothing happen... it was late at night and Jandice was the last boss party needed before porting out, so i forgot all about it. Thanks for shedding light on that one.

---
That's good to know, thanks. I just want to run stuff like BRD/LBRS/UBRS etc. that I've heard talked about so much, and want to make sure I won't get outpaced by new content.
---
Probably easier to just log off and play an alt
---
Right you are, there was talk about Perception higher up in the same string which moved on to rogues and I mixed that discussion and this one up. My bad!

Yup. I added that as a sub-comment here. You are correct.
---
My guild had double nemesis skull cap drop last week... nothing for me this week.
---
Have ya heard ice block, blink into sheep lol
---
You'll have less burst and no mortal strike, which means if there are healers involved, you're at a huge disadvantage.
---
Depends on your class. Perhaps for a warrior. For a Paladin tank, white damage is a trivial source of threat so the speed and proc matter more
---
Everyone just downvote so it disappears

LF OCE guild horde side Bigglesworth.

Precisely

Dungeon locks are account wide, not character specific, meaning you can get locked on your alt for farming a dungeon on your main...

He missed the word "take"... as in "Just take my word for it".
---
It's a lot of fun!
---
When did i mention anything other than pve. Youre making assumptions to make your point seem more correct. Its not.
---
OK OK OK, let's get this over with...
---
* Some people: OMG Fuck Blizzard, China, rights, oppression, do good, etc
---
* Some people: OMG virtue signal, you don't do enough, throw away your phone, etc
---
* Some people: nobody cares\*
---
* Some people: RULES RULES RULES RULES RULES
---
* Some people: Make lists!
---
I think that about covers it.
---
\*FYI "nobody cares" is my favorite one 'cause it's just so *silly*.
---
I pick up on everything, I just don't care considering the swipe of him assuming I would be butt hurt because I play a class that gets out dps by a mage and is why I'm here. 
---
Did I ever say I only spam frostbolt? I'm just making fun of you for being super defensive about a meme.
---
So I‚Äôm still right, I‚Äôm just leaving myself more work for later.  But why would I care?

This is what gave me the idea for this post :)

Too much invested in alch/herb to drop one unfortunately.

Try harding in lowbie dungeons is kinda cringey to me imo. I was druid tanking RFD yesterday and we had a fury warrior goin on about his DPS and posting recount. He was on top but seeing the dude spaz around running all over the place when single targeting. I couldn't figure out what he was doin. It was hilarious to watch. Dude was super into it.
---
how many would be needed for like molten core run?
---
so you wont voice how you feel on a real account and show your support for your cause / coward is all i see here
---
have blizzard said anything about Infernals bug? 
---
Infernals and skellies not disappearing are like the two most importan"non vital" things about classic for me, and they're both broken..
---
If you don't want to shell out on Crusader, I suggest +7 Weapon Damage
---
Your second point is kinda moot. 
---
It‚Äôs not named after the boss because we wanna start referring to dungeons as the name of the last boss. People say VC because deadmines (DM) and dire maul (DM) are the same abbreviation. 
---
I‚Äôll likely just type it out, because ctrl+arrow up key lets you repost your ad lol

I hate that place, i skipped it on my warrior, without a mount it‚Äôs a huge waste of time, most of time you are just running around.....

I cant imagine aoe grinding without ice barrier... especially ZF.. what a pain that would be

You mean speccing arms as tank &lt;55?

Any video of this one?
---
cant drink in bear form :p
---
The cost of the mooncloth bag pattern isnt worth it(40g+ on grobbulus) if you're only making 3 bags to fill the slots other than the felcloth bag. Better to use use mooncloth CDs and save the cloth then have another tailer who has the pattern craft them for you.
---
&gt; coward is all i see here
---
And this particular coward is likely first in line when a new iPhone is released. Dude's sending *thousands* to China every year shopping at Walmart (or buying anything electronic) but yeah, they certainly have raised their tiny fist in solidarity with this shitpost.
---
You don't have any issues not having improved frost nova?
---
As a tank shaman either I'm really lucky or I've never had this issue before.
---
I've spent so much on enchanting and even got the crusader enchant recipe and I keep wondering if I should have just taken herbalism instead.

you need to calm the fuck down. it‚Äôs not that rare. it‚Äôs not going to make you that much gold.
---
You're insane dude. Make a YouTube series!
---
it's a Horde only quest in Hillsbrad. You need to kill yetis in the cave north of Southshore for a magic rod, but the drop rate is so low that most people have to kill every mob in the cave multiple times before it drops
---
Lot of good pet guides and information here

It's easy to oversimplify. In a cutting edge guild/group, his argument might have merit - raise the threat ceiling for dps. But sadly we have tons trying to apply that in pugged 5 mans, where the old math wasn't meant to be applied to
---
Niiice
---
This was my group last night. At least the tank understood he was messing up and overeager, unlike most which somehow blame me for needing to drink after the mage tanked the last 2 back to back pulls.
---
one of the easiest bis items to get. just buy runs from a lock and get it for 15-30g. it‚Äôs not a big deal.
---
I mean personally all my negative experiences. I dont forums have anything to do with that
---
My friend and I had a rule with enchanting and leveling. Vendor only weapons and disenchant all the gear.
---
yep.  thats what me and a bunch of horde did at nessy's camp in STV when there was a 60 mage.  had 10-11 of us going after him, and then camping him until he left
---
It's fucking strong and also incredibly fun to play, I'd get myself a scorch mage back any time I'd had the time to play additional characters.
---
They're just not seen because no hipster streamer used it and all the fanboys only see the experience gain with glowing eyes thus playing like robots.
---
Oof. This reminds me of a TBC server where I ran as a ghost all the way to Azuremyst Isles to get a ravager as a pet for my hunter. I ressed at the gy there and got sent all the way back to Ashenvale.
---
Yes. Lets promote bad dps behavior. Rip that threat away! Fuck their rage!
---
Ah, but Ghost Wolf costs 100 mana.  100 mana that Shamans can't spare lol.
---
It‚Äôs just weird because when you read the comments it‚Äôs seems to be a common thing to say. I still find it utterly ridiculous to call it VC though but maybe it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs so alien to me üòÜ
---
Only being level 31 makes me feel so behind...
---
Because you obviously enjoy questing. I do too!
---
Almost all of the points I mentioned *could* be implemented but Blizzard has consciously elected not to.
---
For example Greater Blessings were added in 1.9, which would be phase 5. Yet Paladins can learn these spells right now. Why is that fine but Eternal Quintessences aren't?
---
Some stuff Blizzard doesn't have control over and I won't fault them for that: Raid and dungeon tactics are already known. People know which mats will become valuable later on. The best specs have been figured out. Out-of-game communication is easier and a lot more common.
---
But clearly they aren't striving to be "as authentic as possible", which is what you claimed. (And just for the record: I don't think this semi-authentic approach is necessarily bad. It just leads to weird situations like the one I described above)
---
As someone who sits in IF and storm wind trying to give out free enchants and then enchanting my bracer 30 times because I have no takers, I concur.
---
invest in people not buy them...
---
I dps as Holy.
---
If you wanna be alone then SM runs is good.
---
Although this is of course assuming the rogue has imp sap.  I'd agree its a bad move to sap without having it lol
---
what addons do you use for the UI?
---
You didn‚Äôt have to make it that personal man :(
---
Wait fr? The worg critter companion does this?
---
Yo does this proc on mind flay? I gotta know.
---
Like I said, not enough time.  By the time we got 4H down, TBC was literally weeks away and enough people in the guild quit wanting to raid that we couldn't attempt the last 2 bosses.
---
Swap Shaman and Druid and I agree
---
**or** They could just be pointing out the fact that you suck at it and would be at the bottom if the DPS charts, DESPITE playing one of the highest dps classes
---
"I pick up on everything" lmao yeah ok buddy
---
r/iamverysmart
---
LoL
---
yes
---
Rather have that dude in my guild than a whole bunch of super serious "no bads" type losers.
---
It's BiS pre raid for a lot of healers. Goes for 150g on my server
---
Is Paladin fun at all while leveling? I absolutely love the class fantasy, but I'm worried I'm not going to have a good time, then just be pigeon-holed into healing at 60.
---
No, it is true...Fire is most dps, but mana consumption is horror. After BWL you gonna respecc to fire for raiding. Also deep frost is best to aoe grind/level, while arcane/frost is best for dungeons/raid single target dps (while being mana efficient).
---
Ahh that's what that torch does. I click it everytime I go past and have never noticed anything that changed.
---
Indeed I take responsibility here. 
---
BTW. I‚Äôm being sarcastic.
---
Spells dont miss, they only get resisted
---
Ah yes, just like Pally DPS.
---
I'm leveling a shaman alt in my 2nd account. You get crap for exp when grouped but you can run your alt through dungeons super early for OP dungeon quest items to make it way easier to level. Helps to have him on follow behind your alt also to ward off gankers and to plow through elite quests. I hit 38 on my shaman in 2 days played doing it this way. Helps my main is a mage and can give int/food/water and I'm gonna soak exp while farming ZF at 45, then soak exp while farming BRD at 51+
---

[sorry I couldn't help myself.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTQyKGlSnhU)
---
The problem is there's actually a delay between stopping movement and the client detecting you as being still. The fact that there is a timing bug was confirmed in the same post they mentioned people were turning.
---
Can pull him into the previous room back to the stairs and when he teleports he goes back to his room, does nothing and runs back. Never have the deal with shadow bolts
---
I think it‚Äôs having the patience to do it without using any green/blue items or the talent tree.  On a PVE server, it‚Äôs a strength of will, but not overly difficult.
---
As a vanilla healer that burned out from raiding, I will always say to do what you want. Just accept that you may be passed over for some one that may have a better spec for the role. 
---
In my case, after a little bit of face melting I specced raiding again and slotted back in. But they did let me try my hand at dpsing, and healing as shadow. I was definitely not where I'd normally be on any chart, but it was fun hanging out in the warlock chat channel for a bit. :D
---
It's a game. Do what makes you happy.
---
Tank can also pull while the healer is drinking.
---
Tanks don't need heals when they are at 95% life, especially if they aren't pulling 10 mobs, and the pull back to their healer.
---
Winter's Chill does work.
---
Warrior should be chaotic neutral with that damn rage
---
My high rank heals heal for more than most cloth players have HP. Is it still bad to downrank?
---
This guy should join my guild. &lt;One Knight Stand&gt;
---
theres a guy named greatwizard on my server just like this!
---
Back in Vanilla I played a rogue, and holy shit if Vael isn't the most fun and satisfying fight in the game for a dagger rogue...
---
Helped my friend farm the leathers for his pre-BiS gear... fuck that shit lol. Ungoro gives me ptsd now
---
Paladins are the most mana efficient healers and don't rely on spirit very much at all, the 5-second rule is rarely utilised by them.
---
Type /who level X where X is your level
---
At 32 flaying is not worthwhile in terms of mana per damage
---
Not really, you can use most useful engineering stuff at around 220-230, and it's relatively cheap to just level by buying shit on ah. It's past \~220 when engi gets expensive. Up to that point it's maybe only 50-60g in total
---
I wouldn't wonder if that set-up is just a nice sneak by your prot warrior to get fully geared as quick as possible without competition.
---
However, bears definitely can be really good.
---
It changed during vanilla, I pretty much guarantee it doesn't do this in classic.
---
At one point it even attacked players for 1 damage.
---
the P server specialists would make up the tiniest fraction of the current player base
---
A prebis fire mage can do nearly as much AoE dps as a prebis shatter frost mage while also being able to pump more single target damage than any other mage spec. It's less mana efficient since people don't have a ton of crit, but not unbearably so. You'd still easily top overall damage meters across an entire dungeon as a fire mage.
---
Lol.  No it doesn‚Äôt . Saying go back to retail is like saying go fuck yourself.
---
Hunters make my blood boil. At least mages can't steal all my shit
---
Time to start selling it :)
---
&gt; I miss iceblock
---
why? so you can delay the inevitable a few seconds?
---
.
---
I would then just argue that I have been in guilds who have had minimal to no drama with a loot council.  I feel like you have never been in a good guild that uses loot council.  Wow, great discussion.
---
Cant rly blink through anything on classic the same way you could on private servers. Other than a wall in org that drops you under the city. Got myself there on accident a few weeks back
---
&gt; The excuse I hear from tanks who refuse to wield a shield is because they can't generate rage or hold threat without the extra damage.
---
That's a load of shit and they just want an excuse to be terrible.
---
The second they walk into a raid they are going to need a shield, if they don't they get crushed. (literally)
---
If they want to run without a shield forever, they should play a god damn druid.
---
As a warlock I learned closer to level 50 that I can even deal with undead rogues. Bring it
---
I am interested in joining. Just started my character on Herod. Added you on Bnet.
---
FYI you still need to run away before you ice block, you'll still fuck up everyone around you if you don't move.
---
34 rouge and 19 mage. Don't give up, loads of us are in jobs with families!
---
I‚Äôm just saying how we do it in my guild. We don‚Äôt struggle with threat and we‚Äôve been 1 shooting ony as of lately.
---
i lost the sash last night, but won the ring against a healer and enhance shammy. Man did that feel good.
---
And taunt causes aggro to temporarily ignore threat (among other effects).
---
What‚Äôs BFA?
---
Oh I certainly didn't expect A and H  peacefully questing next to each other even with contested spawns between them 99% of the time. PVP is still rare as hell here. Players  ignoring each other was the exception, I remember actual feuds starting in Stranglethorn Vietnamt because "red = dead" wasn't just an empty phrase uttered by tryhards on reddit and forums whose actual "PVP plan" in the game was using friendly emotes and hoping for the best.   
---
I leveled a holy priest though, so starting trouble on my own just got me corpse runs. Worst experience I've had was in Stromgarde Keep, human area. A mage around level 50 was literally blasting horde players as they killed Stromgarde Troll hunters and they \*ignored him\*. There were 15+ players trying to do the Trollbane quest line, and they were too busy running after the latest respawn to just gang up and dispose of that mage. He was literally sniping them one by one.
---
Thats hardcore
---
It reminds me of that one time back in the day I decided I wanted to PVP as arcane because I though arcane missiles looked awesome and because I was 12 and wanted to be a different little hipster I guess. So I just used missiles as my main spell and tried to kite.
---
It sucked sooo bad üòÇ

Is the AOE frost build required to join dungeon spellcleave groups as a mage? Or can you participate using other builds (ex single target frost shatter).
---
Priests and Paladins uphold the laws of society and fight for good against the wicked
---
Shamans are mediators between the spirits and ultimately strive to bring balance to the world and protect it's health, which is way more fundamental and important than some set of cultural laws
---
Druids are more than willing to actively fight the powers that be if it's in their true interest of preserving the sanctity of nature, in fact they pretty much exist outside of the whole system
---
Warriors aren't going around causing trouble for anyone really, they just want to pursue martial excellence and don't explicitly care about being righteous or not
---
Mages just want to sit down and read some books like the bunch of fuckin nerds they are
---
Hunters follow their own code and live according to the laws of the jungle, a bunch of wild children
---
Lawful Evil was a tricky one, Shadow Priests are tolerated in society I think, they have a respected place as priests but use their powers and position for questionable ends.
---
Rogues are selfish professional criminals who mostly just care about their own pockets, more than willing to steal and murder if it benefits them, but they have no nefarious ambitions, they're just assholes.
---
Warlocks only care about power and are happy to murder innocent people for their own gain, probably enjoy watching things slowly die before they steal their souls to forcibly enslave a demon for them to sacrifice so they can kill even more things.
---
What is nightfall?
---
That's a big who cares, bro.
---
"Dass not ready yet, daddy" in troll voice.
---
I tap between fights so my health/mana are at roughly the same level then i eat/drink.  Its faster to regen this way.  I dont expect healed at all between fights.
---
During a fight a renew or something is all that is required, unless the tank is going mental and never stopping.  Even then i have cannibalise and bandages and healthstones (although i prefer to use these as an oh shit button).
---
I tap early when a fight engages and never expect to be at 100% health because we passively regen anyway.  A lock at full health is wasting resources.  This also means I dont want/expect to be healed unless im being hit or the fight is going on forever.  Even then tanks have way more priority than a lock due to the health regen i have.
---
Congrats! I'm curious though, why not Night Elf Rogue? Wouldn't the Shadowmeld give you another way to drop combat or in other ways save your life?
---
you would need to specify which rank you want to display in the \#showtooltip line. i.e: `#showtooltip Healing Wave(rank 8)`.
---
clearing trash is way better than boss dps for leveling
---
well i obviously care, otherwise i wouldnt have asked the question.

I didn't know in 2005 what tribute was and at this point I'm too scared to ask.

True, sorry it that came across as aggressive to you - I just get so tired of people excusing DPS for not doing their *entire* job, which isn't just smashing as much damage as possible on the mob until they pull aggro/die/yell at the tank.

Take the talent that reduces shock CD every time you dispel an effect, ~~and it also buffs windfury chance by like 15% for 14 secs per dispel and increases nature damage [aka storm strike] by 50%.~~

I thought Ironman mode was maxing without dying?
---
Cause you couldn‚Äôt during vanilla when it was added. If they add it at all it would probably be the vanilla iteration. Which is no PvE-&gt;PvP transfer and a 6 month cooldown.

Edit: pretty sure you could do PvP-&gt;PvE during vanilla but not the other way.
---
Why do you assume 'woman' was the qualifier there? Preeeety sure its cause she is new.

Obviously it fluctuates on every server,  but I have to really Hawkeye that shit to find mooncloth at a price that would even net me a worthwhile profit. They avg around 19g per with bags only selling for 20.5. No room to reset the market when people are selling travelers for 21.5g.
---
hope somone says its noticabkle an still worth lol
---
It is!
---
So was the first part.
---
Even better, if you max range a heal, you can heal, HoT, and drink before combat flags you.
---
Hard truth ^
---
I'm not talking about how much damage it does.  I'm just saying it works on a similar fashion if you couldnt find another tank.
---
Single target shatter is fine.
---
Imp Blizzard slow is nice but really doesn‚Äôt change the game. Imp cone of cold with 1 point is fine. TBH no one is going to know or care while leveling.
---
Skull does not remove stuns, you have to predict incoming CC that is broken by dmg such as blind, gouge and helmet. How are you supposed to skull sap if you dont know that a stealthed rogue is around...please stop the pseudo talk

This. This right here. Unplug the ethernet cord from your brother's computer and plug it into yours.

You have a problem mate, read the first thing you see on the internet and believe it 100% without questioning the evidence or asking my side of the story. 
---
The only one having a problem here is you mate. 
---
Ask yourself three questions. 
---
1. Why did I even have master loot? 
---
2. Why did we vote to kick the mage? 
---
3. Why did the other 3 players do another run with me as Master Looter directly after? 
---
I actually don‚Äôt care about what that salty mage does with his so called ‚Äúevidence‚Äù, there were 3 other players there also seeing it dropped seeing I won it legit.
---
Both got for about 180g that‚Äôs not that much gold.
---
A waste since Thrash Blade is significantly better.
---
Debuff ruins that wep
---
Going prot for dungeons is mostly a QoL thing.  I generate more threat and take less damage, but neither of those are huge issues as long as the party isn't terrible.
---
Concussion blow is great for clearing trash, provided that the DPS is doing a decent job of focusing.
---
Adding to this, also drops [very good looking gun](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18755/xorothian-firestick) for hunter.
---
Well you sort of sum it up. It‚Äôs painful to level IMO. I‚Äôm only leveling mine alt in dungeons. At 36 now and refuse to quest.
---
TL:DR; Blizzard won't nerf DM Tribute runs. Both are great choices, do whatever you have the time and patience to facilitate.  
---
Although I doubt DM will get nerfed, due to Blizzards current stance on #NoChanges, you can do the runs with a mage as well. I think the biggest issue with mage farming is how reliant on gear it is and because people are so eager to jump into the AoE grind they wind up becoming deterred after a few failed attempts. Gearing a mage is the other battle as there are so many clothies, let alone mages in content that getting the gear for some is harder than a hunter comparatively.
---
Why? Take joy in whatever you can. If that is just one thing then at least you have that. It can potentially be unhealthy... but that is true of almost anything. Let people have their fun without making a judgement call on how they live their life
---
Yeah. /1
---
Barbarous Blade(tomorrow) and Peacemaker are both better.
---
I think it's just "Lady Prestor glares at you.".
---
How do you get into the options :- )
---
Hunters have so many two hander options also... So stupid
---
Bigglesworth is best
---
It's def worth. Buy it at 51 and never worry about rends
---
I am not specifically talking just them. Many returning players are eager to show off how l33t they are at this game and don't understand that some people are new, new to tanking, or just like to take dungeons at a moderate pace. This is most evident when you pug dead mines. Dead mines is one of the most toxic places right now.
---
It's something like "Lady Prestor glares at you".
---
The NPC retains the name "Lady Onyxia", but the dialogue refers to her as Prestor still.
---
This is for Dire maul north right? how man node's can you get to in a tribute run? I am trying to figure out if mining is worth having for tribute run farming on my druid.
---
Barbarous Blade drops tomorrow.
---
This is a video game. I think you forgot that part.
---
The zone in between their melee range and their charge/intercept range.
---
Thrash Blade is good for Fury Warriors for all the secondary effects such as the increased Rage and Flurry procs.  Works fairly well as a tanking weapon to boot, since you can proc it off of Sunder Armor and basically get enough Rage to use Sunder again immediately after.  I've used it before all the way up to 58 on a Warrior, replaced it with Bone Slicing Hatchet at that point.  Thrash+Flurry Axe is the dream.
---
Or they just keep doing it to the poor guy over and over again. Guy gets back and wonders why he hasn‚Äôt made any progress while auto running.
---
Is this not a pve server?? No point
---
You must have been on a backwoods server or something. I'd get coords like 90% of the time on Alliance Doomhammer.
---
Maybe my server was some sort of elitist haven since I always see people saying "yeah no one know what stats even did LMFAO" when we had full bis slots, hit cap breakdowns etc etc in our casual af guild.
---
Is it really half her spells? The only fire damage in my rotation is ignite, not trying to down talk how you‚Äôre playing just wondering if i‚Äôm missing something in my gameplay.

I deleted every single character that died, the last one never died, but I guess I didn't make that clear enough on my post since I saw this comment a lot, I will fix it.
---
I have 2 char banks full of herbs and leather. Should I get in on the AH before diremaul launches, or after?
---
back in 2006 a party of epicced out hordes killed my lowbie warr on their way to grim batol. i rezzed and they killed me again. came back to my body and the warr was dueling the mage. when he knelt in defeat with 1 hp, i rezzed, charged, and killed him. they all laughed, killed me again, and went on their way.
---
While that would certainly help people buy enchants, it will just make being an enchanter an even bigger investment and murder your margins.
---
Resto shaman here. Been healing my war friend and hes used a 2h to tank everything except ubrs. He keeps threat and does  40% of the damage most of the time. Incredible dungeon clear speed
---
Don‚Äôt they all?
---
Thank you, this has been most helpful.
---
It depends what you want out of it. I dropped herbalism this weekend for eng. I got to 220 and spent like 10 gold total. Now the last 80 will probably be 50-80g but frankly I leveled mostly for sapper charges and will slowly finish the other levels as I go.

---
I think you don't understand how alignment works. Chaotic has nothing to do with how good or evil the party is, it's more like how well they follow societal law and uphold said law.
---
Shaman are all about the laws of the elements, in fact breaking these laws causes shamans to lose the ability to speak with the elements and basically become I guess warriors... lol...
---
Druids on the other hand operate completely independent of any code other than their own. The have their own society that transcends traditional law laid down by the horde and alliance. They also fight for different reasons than many other classes, primarily to preserve nature and Azeroth. 
---
Feel like the explanations behind each class and why is pretty on point.
---
Even without addons, you should be able to figure it out =). Just get you heals lined up and use them. Make sure you tell your group when you're out of mana so they stop before the next pull so you can drink.
---
You'll figure it out.. just as the millions before you did =)
---
Should I enchant it with crusader/fiery?
---
I am leveling as dual wield fury and will respec to prot at 58 or so
---
Druids literally have a spec called balance
---
I don't sit long, I'll call out a few times, then just enchant my own stuff over and over.  I'm not really in it for the money, it's all about that Smoking Heart and because I'm too lazy and impatient to find an enchanter, would rather do it myself.
---
Which, in my opinion, isn't boring. Add your poisons, watch for big flashy numbers, and try to properly time your finishers so that you don't waste combo points on a dead mob. I'm having nothing but a good time over here.
---
It looks like you're straddling the mount instead of sitting on it.
---
That question might be really weird now, but what's the supposed way to reach him? üòÖ
---
As a follow-up, if I was really wanting to do a PVP prot spec, it would look something like this:
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LmhxdhfZVZxbts0hzb](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LmhxdhfZVZxbts0hzb) 
---
(Feel free to swap weapon spec to Mace or Sword to suit your preference).
---
This build is an absolute unit in BGs. With healer support you can pretty much negate enemy warriors, paladins and rogues, lock down casters with your stuns/silence, keep hunters in melee, and as an orc, an absolutely unfair 45% stun resist. If you ever want to wade into the front-line of AV and slam everybody, or be the wall that holds off all comers on an AB node or the WSG flag room, try this out.
---
Note though, that this is a build for an organized pvp team in battlegrounds, with healers. for open-world random pvp, you'll be better off with the 31/20 MS spec or 20/31 BT.
---
You are gonna get rekt with that low fr against rag.
---
Looking for a mod that will give me a visual warning when I trigger a buff (in this case, clearcasting for elemental shaman). I recall Scrolling Combat Text back in the day, but I'm not sure if that is still a thing.
---
No use a 60 mage to power level the lock
---
Is Dreamweave or shadowweave better? Don't a couple overlap?
---
Damn really? With how many hours?
---
But wouldn't the xps be dampened
---
I don't get why people spend 5 hours trying to start a single rend run with MH reserved, when they could just run it 10 times instead.
---
GET REKT SON
---
Yeah  doing it for grenades mostly. Though I'd like 300 for force reactive disc
---
Was trying to kill some of those human mobs in the top north east corner of alterac mountains on my warrior. Accidently pulled 2 and died. Corpse ran all the way back from South shore. Spawned and a stealthed mob appeared on top of me.Tried to run away and pulled another stealthed mob. 
---
Yeah I took the rez sickness.
---
AOE spam in general has become too prevalent.  I almost want to back out of groups when I see that there more than one mage because it will be a shit show healing it.
---
Font?
---
You're an absolute idiot if you don't think starting a fight counter-spelled on shadow against a mage/lock isn't horrible.
---
Bad. Just go deep BM until you‚Äôre more geared and then respec to mm/survival.
---
Where did you grind the past few levels? I've got a horde lock that's 38.5 or so and most quests are orange to me. Thinking about grinding to 40, would love to hear your experience.
---
I question how many lawful good Priests and Pallys are in the Scarlet Crusade
---
What realm?
---
Fair point, but that's an easy ignore IMO. If that exact message were broadcast without spamming I would honestly not even care. I would harbor no resentment for the gentleman. If he can sucker some people into that run (you may be exaggerating slightly on the broadcast haha) good for him I suppose.
---
Thanks for the response! Does having Frostbite impact AOE dungeon farming? Sounds like I can get around no imp bliz but I‚Äôm wondering if freezing mobs in the pack accidentally might screw it up
---
r/unexpectedlygaythanos
---
It doesn't. Also I believe the happiness loss scales for pvp the same way durability damage does.
---
A 58 mage tried to gank me not noticing my partner just behind me. I was 51 she was 50 at the time.
---
We kept him in a stun lock together and killed him.
---
Later saw him struggling to kill a bunch of mobs in felwood but we didn't finish him off. Just waited and /smile and waved as he died and took his mob. 
---
We generally leave horde alone because we just want to quest but it was kind of bittersweet for us
---
Gilroy Bold

I checked and there isn't

It's 4% extra 100% of the time to be accurate.

Because in BGs a few seconds really matter, amirite?

Elvui+Redtukz UI modified.
---
And? How is that 'content'
---
https://lmgtfy.com/?q=wow+classic+phases
---
To purchase bags, grey/white armor/weapon for much cheaper than vendor, cloth for bandages, quest items for easy turn-ins (looking at you, Green Hills of Stranglethorn)
---
You really need more hit rating gear in order to do more DPS as fury. You should probably pay 25g or whatever for a warlock or hunter to solo Princess in Maraudon for you until the 1% hit rating ring drops.
---
Also complete the lengthy BRD questline beginning in Searing Gorge with "The Flawless Flame" from Kalaran Windblade for some 2% hit rating shoulders.
---
Then farm the Unforgiven from Strat Live side for the 2% hit rating Mask of the Unforgiven, these all in combination with your guard captain rune will get you to the special hit cap for axes as an orc of 6% hit rating.
---
Also you can try to get Tooth of Eranikus from ST, or just AH a green Warlord's Axe and abandon your Thrash Blade even as good as it is, since you don't have the hit to use it.
---
Addon recommendation for the mp5 thing? Im a warrior but plan on doing lava runs for Ironfoe frequently. This could be a huge help
---
I was thinking more Ultima Online
---
&gt; It was always VC - people calling it DM were the noobs all along and just didn't realize it.
---
Stop pretending this is fact. My realm in vanilla it was always DM, and that was in fucking EU where Dire Maul came nearly at release.
---
It wouldn't be Reddit without the cringe now, would it?

Was VC on Chromaggus,

The difference is you can easily be trapped in a job - building your own group is not that difficult - or joining one without reservations.

Thank you for your selfless sacrifice.

You might need a break son. Enjoy the weather. Fall is the best time of year.
---
I saw a warrior (tank) advertising they were LFG with items reserved for themselves.
---
Add this thread to the list.
---
Druids also operate outside of faction and have their own neutral zone were they are not only willing to attack their own faction if warranted but actively do.
---
Druids are like the definition of chaotic good.
---
They want what's best for nature/Azeroth(Good) by any means necessary even if it means breaking their own factions already established laws.(chaotic)
---
My son's due in 12 days and this has been something I've been wondering as well!
---
Good tanks understand when a healer is drinking and don't pull to much if they want to keep the ball rolling ehich I understand.  Some don't though.  They just take off into the next room lol.
---
I love when I get on the same page as a tank though and they already know that if I sit down to drink without calling oom that they can keep pulling because he knows that I'll jump up if I have to and he knows his limits.  Then I call oom then they adjust and pull slowly until I get up.    Perfect tank/heal partnership.  :)
---
What unit frames are those?
---
i'm having a hard time deciding between two specs when i hit 60. if it matters, i'm on a PVP server, i plan on doing BGs/World PVP when the honor system comes out and i also wanna raid.

i'm having a hard time deciding, but i'm leaning toward the Holy one 'cuz it gives me more raw output/stats. tho, PI is really good...
---
also: when is a good time to respec outta Spirit Tap? i could really use those 5 points for better things, but, the spirit is awesome for leveling.
---
Haha, I hope this gets voted to the top :)
---
As a healer - the difference between 90% mana and OOM wand spamming to try to kill things before they kill the tank is about 2 mobs.
---
But I'm still low level.
---
Lots of people are hoping for Classic+, which by no means is limited like that.
---
But yeah, retail's just not a game everyone likes. I think it's bad for me, but I know people who like those types of games.
---
This is why i look through comments.
---
This isn't even true for trash, e.g. on Lava Surgers you definitely want to be using Fire Blast.
---
Sure it does. They're being stingy with what words you're allowed to use.
---
And they both suck
---
One of my and im sure many. Favourite movies of all time
---
People did get banned for it. Then the bans got reversed, but with a warning that it could get you banned in the future.
---
Druids are traditionally neutral in fantasy settings.
---
Naw its Definitely VC, not an issue on classic atm cuz DMs not out yet, but still VC is the easiest, since ppl will almost always ask what Wing if you just post DM. It's much more expedient to use VC.
---
Lawful Evil is usually misguided lawful good... 
---
Fundamentally they wanted to wipe out the undead and stop the scourage... which is in part everyone's goal...
---
He‚Äôs right, you‚Äôre just embarrassing yourself
---
But 90% tip 1g so that's why we charge a fee for the rare and expensive enchants.
---
There‚Äôs an addon called Memoria that will screenshot for you the moment you level!
---
You sure? why do so many bis lists have shadow wrath
---
As a long time Alliance player who was convinced to go horde for Classic the one thing I really miss about ally is IF.  It really is the best place in the World.
---
Was allience from vanilla till about cataclysm.
---
Most of my guild mate still rolled allience but some of my friends and me rolled horde.
---
Liked to see the horde side of the quest. Brings new elements to the game for me as i did almost all of the allience quest to much
---
thats cause its a hunter's pet and he is just standing on it
---
People really need to learn what confirmation bias is with these dumb roll posts
---
I've never seen a holy pally use consecrate in a dungeon because that's just insane. Yeah man, just dump 1/4 your mana on a crap AoE that's going to cause more downtime than you save off of the fight. Yeah, that's super dumb.
---
I'm also playing a holy pally right now.
---
Honestly, you general less threat depending on how exactly you're going about it while prot. A charge/ss/ww combo then going to defensive stance with a shield can be wildly superior for getting some decent threat aoe for instance.
---
#[laughs in mage ZF farming]
---
If someone is providing bag-crafting services for tips (using your mats), what is an appropriate tip?  Is it based on like 15-20-25-30% for the restaurant industry (based on what the mats/bag go for on the AH)?  Or is there an in-game scale that is deemed appropriate?
---
I understand it's a "tip" but what is recommended/acceptable/the norm?
---
"pretty much confirmed" ... "not sure if they will do it" ... 
---
Yep, totally confirmed... /s
---
Fury Warrior
---
I would stick to what you're already doing assuming you're having a good time from what you're saying. The grass isn't always greener on the other side.
---
You guys still have the option to spend more and take up a bag slot...
---
It‚Äôs not bad at all with an ok group, at least at low levels. Just finished a deadmines run without it and it was smooth as butter. Just keep ‚Äòtaunting‚Äô with your judgement and body pull with ret aura. Had to have our Druid off tank on some pulls that got out of hand but I can off heal pretty well so it was actually fun.
---
At least he‚Äôs doing it at the beginning rather than right before the end? I got ganked one time right after the final wave of the robot chicken escort quest in feralas and I about broke my monitor.
---
Horde Warrior on Sulfuras (open to rerolling class/realm for the right guild). Currently level 54. Open to tanking or dpsing on the war, or any role if I reroll.
---
Looking for a guild to raid, run dungeons, and pvp with in a fun, relaxed environment. Available M,W,F,Sa evenings and weekend days. Ideal guild would be able to be efficient during raids (members expected to show up on time, keep coms clear during fights), but have fun and joke around during downtime and out-of-raid hours. I can be raid ready in a week or two on the war or about 6 weeks if I reroll, but I'm not in a rush. I want to see all raid content eventually and have fun pvping, but don't care about server firsts or speed runs or anything along those lines.
---
&gt; I have a question too wise one. I play warrior and I‚Äôm casual. I plan to get to 60 a month or so from now if I‚Äôm lucky. I want to tank, but will I be too late to the game?
---
Nah you'll be fine, Reddit may be full of people posting their 60's getting epic mounts or raiding MC, but from what I've seen the majority of the playerbase isn't anywhere near there. 
---
Add to the fact that tanks are among the most desirable role in dungeons, and you'll have absolutely no trouble finding groups.
---
&gt;Also I‚Äôm back from playing vanilla when I was like an 11 yo mess around player. Think groups would be willing to help me learn or should I just start with dps?
---
People will always be there to help and offer advice, the classic community is really helpful. Just let people know you're new to whatever role, and if they have feedback to let you know what you can improve. 
---
That being said, you will find arrogant assholes or people that flame you for being new and asking questions, but in general these people are completely toxic and you should avoid them if you can.
---
don't worry, even if you'd be a veteran pvp-er, you'd still be endlessly farmed.
---
Thank you for the info. I‚Äôll have to look up the stance specific macros.
---
alliance
---
Someone never took a statistics class I see.
---
I used this strategy to get a deadmines group and it was easy as pie and everyone was chill. 10/10 would self deprecate again
---
DWing doesn't help flurry uptime, however, as offhand swings consume charges.
---
Because they itemize differently, its easier to maintain a very high critrate as slamspec, which does translate into more flurry uptime. DW's primary advantage is the extra base damage and rage generation.
---
Pretty sure that‚Äôs him placing a filler comment so he can check back later and see if someone answered. Get over yourself
---
Is there a way to disable repeatable quests on Questie addon from showing up in the map?
---
Grey enemies (10+ levels below) don‚Äôt count as HK‚Äôs so at least that will mitigate some of the lowbie slaughter
---
I wish I could have stayed fire
---
I just get ancy when it's not organized
---
That's literally never happened to me unless I was moving or turning when I use it. If you *are* moving or turning then there won't be an animation and you won't drop combat but you'll still drop threat.
---
Where else do you LFG???
---
I disagree.
---
Man those shaman totem quests were some of my favorite experiences in WoW to this day. I decided to roll priest this time but might alt roll a shaman. If BC comes after this, I had always wanted to roll a Dreanai for BC, could get that chance this time around

There is when one of them is aimed primarily at children about 10 years old.

Pretty much in controlled situations all top DPS rotations are just as easy and boring as the rogues. The best rotation for dagger DPS just changes the opener to ambush from garrote and then SS for BS
---
A crit - &gt; parry hasted crit is just as likely to kill a warrior, there's 0 reason to be crit capped on a warrior with double shield block charges, and any warrior who needs that to survive is not playing at a level where the tank choice is the limiting factor.
---
Not to mention the fact that you can literally armor cap a bear right now, meaning that double crit in 1 second (parry haste gives at most 40% speed up, so minimum of 1 second between swings) is barely even doing 50% of the tanks health.
---
A bear is a better choice right now, with exceptions being doggie in MC where frenzy and double attackspeed (both heads "melee" actually can lead to a ~70% HP 2xcrit) and Nefarian.
---
Not to mention that consistent damage is a lot easier to heal, and more threat means bosses dies quicker with less randomness (fury warrior gets sick opener? Well guess you're down a few melees).
---
Druid is a great tank right now, just don't try aoe tanking on them, they'll melt.
---
Demonshear is solid on a paladin. Yes you want to stick to swords or maces if you can help it the weapon skill adds quite a bit of +hit for free.
---
I had a Priest the other night who said that although healing chaotic groups was fun it's nice to have a tank that knows what he's doing and doesn't need much healing.
---
I offered to take off my shield to make things more interesting for him. He declined.
---
And, omg, getting the Aegis of the Scarlet Commander was awful. It took 15 runs and I lost the shield 3 times to other warriors and a shaman. I just wanted the best shield available for a long time that would let me to continue to tank with ease.
---
Nah we love Thrall, why would we want to overthrow him?
---
For most servers it‚Äôs only going to suck for alliance.  Some of the servers are so lopsided it‚Äôs absurd.  The worst thing for horde is going to be ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt find anyone to kill‚Äù because the alliance all moved to the 2-4 non super horde servers.
---
Thanks! Makes sense especially compared to, like OP explained, Dwarf.
---
I‚Äôm actually really surprised that Blizz never did a chariot mount... They have a lot of brainpower there, they must‚Äôve had a good reason...
---
You're kinda right, you can go whatever you want and clear content, it is classic after all. The spec I mentioned is objectively the best single target dps spec though, but i'm not even using it because I prefer being able to farm dungeons and shit.
---
It's probably due to raid spec being one of the most boring specs for a mage, i cant wait to go pvp spec in phase 3
---
Welcome to the jungle, we've got fun and games
---
You cast faster if you press the keybind once before the spell ends, the exact timing changes on your latency. I haven't seen this discussed in years,  but you can find old threads about it on elitist jerks in the internet archives. Spamming the button makes you cast slightly slower.
---
Really though, it‚Äôs just gonna change time spent drinking to time spent conjuring stacks 2 at a time.
---
Before the census tools broke, that was a good way to look at raw numbers for each server and find a relative balance. I rolled on Kirtonos for similar reasons but I ran Horde instead. I‚Äôm not sure if those tools still work though. You may be able to find old census data from before it stopped but the balance for factions has surely changed on some servers since then. Best of luck finding your server!
---
Like the other comment says, rivenspike and bone slicing hatchet is better than the options, purely because of wep skill.
---
It might actually give you more dps to go edgemasters and Dal'Rends, but at that point just buy the axes instead.
---
This is the correct perspective. I think the person you replied to basically meant this.
---
The items and gold transfer can be a potential issue. But I personally liked starting back at square one with my alt. Felt more genuine to work my way back up, instead of being constantly funded by my main. And you are forced to build new connections and friendships as well. It is like removing the crutches of having a high level character and high level connections. Feels more like starting the game new, rather than just starting a character new.
---
Cool! I forget that Cloak of Shadows isn't in Classic
---
&gt;Don't bitch on the forums, crap like this is what created the casual monster we have in live.
---
Hardly the same lol.
---
Enchanting your cloak with +3 agility and then having your 10% crit buff removed is just plain bad design. There's nothing interesting about this.
---
I think Classic+ is a pipe dream, we don't even have a toggle option for the high-res character models or any later upgrades in Classic, and Blizzard has specifically stated they're not even going to have a full compliment of responsive GM services, much less concurrent development for what's financially the equivalent of a second MMO. I'm fairly convinced that they'll do BC and Wrath servers at least, but literally going for a secondary fork of the established lore is completely out of the question. They've maintained, less a few abnormalities and retcons, a consistent story through more than two decades of games. They're not going to go back and shove ogres in edgewise to supplement a revisiting of a previous version of a game that's still going.
---
Jesus christ.

How long should it take me to go from 20-30? I realize leveling is slow in this game but I'm currently at 23 and I feel like it takes me 4-5 hours to level up which I feel like is slower than average but I don't know. 
---
Part of it is I don't know where to quest. The barrens are pretty much tapped out of quest I can actually complete and I've done the easy quests in stone talon but now I'm stuck fighting harpies and centaurs. Should I just grind out mobs?
---
I (58 alliance hunter) just came flying to chillwind camp only to discover a priest (58) and mage (60) standing at the crossroads. Naturally I stard viper-kiting them both, but the priest was distracted healing the mage to notice that he had no shield and no mana. I pop bestial wrath and intimidation and kited the mage trying ti reach me. Both end up dead and I dtand there with 100% hp.

Of course it's a dwarf. Not exaggerating when I say that 80% of the allies who ganked me from 1-60 were dwarves. All dwarves are now on my KoS List.

I did a lower level dungeon with a higher level tank in full pre raid BiS and it went smoothly.  Obviously that player was skilled unlike these shield wearing swine mucking around the bottom of the DPS charts.

Yikes dawg, enjoy your mediocrity. You can't even form a well thought out rebuttal and instead resort to cheeky comebacks, how pathetic.

This happened to me during my first devilsaur kill. I was level 54 and it was a tense battle. Healing my pet with bandages after using scare beast, watching my doggo die before my very eyes. I got the beast to around 10% health and managed to kite it and kill it. Atlast, after many failures, my first devilsaur skin and kill. Just as i went in for the skin i got stunned out of nowhere and my prize was robbed from me. Now you're thinking, what did i learn from this ordeal. It's simple really.... use the spy addon.

Yeah, I figured that as well (given the unique ID and everything).

The people that post logs despite no one asking are normally the ones that are the worst for this.

Do you have a link?  Not saying you are wrong but this does go against the top end caster meta.  Also, if you for example, have a skinning macro and you put it on key vs scroll wheel, scroll wheel comes out ahead every time even at higher pings.  Have actually tested this on classic.

Why does it seem like so many people think it's impossible to have a bad tank? I mean not even bad though, either. When I run with an amazing tank I know it because I can open up right away and not pull aggro. If the tank isn't as good I have to FD. There are definitely noticeable skill levels in tanking.

I would just do your attunements if it happens to drop so be it. Work on the rest of your gear and if you have everything else go for it but the MH is super rare.
