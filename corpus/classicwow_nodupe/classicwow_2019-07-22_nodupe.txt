Thanks!

Yeah, I want to experience everything the game has to offer on my main character, and complete every quest whether its pointless or not.  while this may not be too efficient level-wise, i will also be leveling mining and blacksmithing as well as fishing/first aid/cooking....traveling to every single zone will help collect all quest recipes, all recipes exclusive to certain vendors, will help me reach exalted with all the factions, and ill make good money through mining.
---
Best analogy.
---
Aye was just thinking this the other day when I was thinking of a new video to listen to while at work. First thing that came to mind was just the weird presentation he puts out. I didn't even know what to call it, but that pretty much describes it.
---

---
Every. Video. Its like a roller coaster of building up his tone and it plummets the next sentence lol.
---
I wouldn't mind at all to jeep the run till classic Bfa... Like a game for the valiant
---
Yeah, can't wait for my toon to be BiS and look like an uncoordinated potato.
---
My brother wants to go Druid but he's gotten rattled after seeing all the druid bashing. What should he know starting out as a new druid primarily focused on pvp?
---
This isn't true.
---
TBC raiding was over-tuned as fuck when it landed, *for sure.* SSC and TK were a clusterfuck of nope until they were re-balanced, coincidentally, when BT and Hyjal were ready for primetime. They were still going for the "variety of raids" design at that point, and those 2 bosses were the limiting factors preventing access.
---
I've played with people in those uber-hardcore guilds who think sitting on a boss for 26 hours is going to make you "better" at the fight, but the reality is they were never intended to be killed.
---
Then there was the extreme item-level power creep. The incremental gains from raid-to-raid in WoW Classic were largely non-significant. For a Rogue in Classic, going from full 8/8 Nightslayer to full 8/8 Bloodfang (T1 to T2) was a difference of +7 stam, +50 AP, -0.5% crit, and +1% hit (also +2% dodge, and Immunity to Disarm.) A pure DPS class basically gained ~20 DPS, or about 5% damage. It was so non-consequential, it was often better to not wear a full set. 
---
This shit wasn't true at all in TBC. Itemization was far, far too plentiful and itemization was now being devised by a formula to ensure harder difficulty content always produced better loot (and significantly more of it in terms of drops per-raider.) The only itemization being designed by humans in TBC were tier set bonuses, and for DPS specs, they always had to create a power spike instead of providing utility like in Classic, meaning they were now basically mandatory. Passive resistances were also gone as to not degrade the potency of items.
---
All of the difficulty in TBC raiding was manufactured. The lack of future content being finished or players trying to do content that was tuned for gear they simply didn't have because it actually mattered now, was the difference.
---
If I was a game designer in TBC-era WoW, assuming the raid content was actually ready for prime time, almost nothing would have changed except for the itemization power creep. Replacing all of your gear just makes the world smaller.
---
Tankless is actually best for melee cleave. 3-4 dps warriors and a healer is all you need.
---
Please stop
---
Per se*
---
Ugh, this. 
---
I might add:
---
„Unpopular opinion: *quite popular opinion. *“
---
If your pugging then ya sure, but you could make the shadowmeld argument for literally any class. 
---
Wars have the only healing reduction skill in the game and this makes them the best shot callers. If your not in the frontline calling targets for your team, your not doing ur job correctly. MS is a death sentence for anyone who has it, if the team piles them.
---
If 85% of people leave because of non mandatory aesthetics they are small-minded as hell.
---
I wish the mods would institute something like “meme Monday” so people can get it out of their system and farm their karma.
---
Nah.  It was because of the crazy tight dps checks in early sunwell progression.  Entire classes got sat on m'uru because they couldn't swing enough dick.  A guild's luck on warglaives and dst's had a huge impact on whether they would clear muru the first few months.  Retarded guilds also struggled with felmyst calls.  
---
You see it in bfa with the mythic leaderboards too.  Certain classes absolutely dominate and others aren't seen in any of the top 100 group comps.  Tends to come down to good mobile aoe dps and good tank aoe stuns.
---
Apparently Druids are a must for WS as flag carrier in pre mades
---
No doubt. Sounds a lot more fulfilling than rushing to 60. Keep in mind that it might be difficult to find those underlevel quests as they won’t show up on your minimal. As for quests you don’t want to miss, it might help to do a quick read through joanas leveling guide. There may be a few quests that appear out of the way but flow well with his guide that you might otherwise miss
---
You can also kill mages with gnome racial, spider belt, and rocket helm, 3 charges and 2 ways to escape novas.  And maybe even rocket boots on top of all of it.
---
I dont think you understand just how much money and time it would take to test and develop "Classic+". If you truly believe there is a scenario in which they would ever consider this venture a better option than an already rave reviewed TBC expansion you are completely out of touch with reality.
---
The difference is in the order of 10s of millions of dollars. Even if they wanted to do it I they probably wouldn't.
---
People like you can write these walls of text until the end of time but it wont change how time and money works.
---
its hard to decide to what is most powerful ... 
---
what does that mean ... every class has something insane about it for pvp. 
---
shaman - elemental is super strong and ehnacement but with "mc gear" its gonna be hard but not imposible
---
paladin both retri and holy are crazy good
---
huntard survival hibrid or marksman is always super versatile
---
druid you have to carry flag best in the game but you also have some neet abilities for group play later on (skrimishing etc), just do hybrid pvp spec and you are golden all around.
---
warrior - Mortal strike no further discussion needed snowballs with healer
---
priest - shadow insane across the board, holy best pvp healer 
---
mage - frost is crazy good arcane is one trick pony but viable
---
warlock - its pretty strong, i think people here think overestimate power of soul link , yes its super powerful and tanky but reallistically that build is made to kill mages and huntards and such... melee classes generally rape you at mc level. But actually all 3 warlock specs are good all around for entire vanila. 
---
rogue - super strong all around , just play assasination and be good with it and you are aleardy mini demi god. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
beauty of vanila is all classes have something strong about them for pvp and i remember when i played for r14 we used all specs all the time... some had more spots then the others tho obviously.
---
If classic+ includes class and spec improvements at least as good as TBC's then I think  a large majority of the community could rally behind Classic+, I don't think anyone is attached to a specific dungeon to the degree people are attached to their characters, and new content is always cool.
---
But we already KNOW TBCs class designs are next level... Why gamble on the current devs out doing them? You can pick and poke at silly details of the upgraded classes, but it's still a better starting point than vanilla design.   Mages water elemental breaking warlock class ID?  Please... By that logic warriors and rogues being able to shoot bows and arrows breaks hunter class id
---
There's a looot a great content in TBC besides class design, but I would be happy to see it cannibalized and used as fodder for classic+ the only part that's not negotiable is the class/spec improvements.
---
And no one said you can't work on the classes from there.  it's just a known "better" state to base improvements from.
---
#nochanges
---
You are absolutely right with everything you said. Take my upvote. 
---
Others: read what he said.
---
These simulations is garbage, they don't even have the same durations.
---
Adjusting for that, the Gnome would have ~19 more DPS than the Mage.
---
But a simulation only using 45 casts is very much garbage.
---
Druids aren't rogues true. But a good kittt dps pulls crazy numbers. Check out Shedo the druid on youtube he's shredding it up.
---
A lot of people I've spoken to have expressed their interest in "having fun" this time around in classic and rolling hunters and warlocks, whatever that is supposed to mean. I dunno if it's because they can level efficiently solo or quickly or what.
---
Me personally, I'm not worried too much about playing a saturated class since I'm confident in my abilities and going into the game with a guild already.
---
Worrying about class saturation might make more sense for PUGs and solo folk though.
---
Summoning stones didn't led to LFD. The casualization of raids that wotlk created transformed the end game for the average player from dungeons to raids.
---
There are 3 types of players
---
Casuals, in vanilla/tbc had fun leveling, doing stuff just for fun, and if they eventually got to max level, they would make a dungeon not for gear, but for fun.
---
Average players in vanilla/tbc played dungeons. Easy to get 5 people, not too much preparation was needed, and they could try to get some upgrades to their gear.
---
Tryhards in vanilla/tbc went to raid, raids were for the 10% of players.
---
This change of mentality on blizzard that everyone needed to see everything led to dungeons being less important, as those were made for farming, a small step between a fresh max level character and a raid ready one, or to leveling and making sure that the player is always geared.
---
With dungeons being not as important as before, wow needed to make those easier to find a group and to enter (and literally using LFD gave rewards to reflect this), so they could start to play the content designed for them.
---
With the obvious first step, lets get rid of fucking layering.
---
By what a factor of .04? That’s nothing. Yea weapon skill helps, but if your trying to flurry tank you should be using petitions blade, a dagger, and if you want mitigation you should be using a sword with good stats.
---
So cringe
---
they are the deadest in retail. vanilla is a mmo so comparing them is redundant.
---
You're telling me.
---
One simulation is 4 seconds longer than the other. You don't go from 2 more to 19 more dps in 4 seconds.
---
TBC didn't lead to Wrath any more than vanilla did by simply precessing it.
---
Cata didn't kill WoW. The game has survived way past it's expiration date.
---
New content, particularly when catch-up content is included, makes old content obsolete. There are ways to mitigate this, but it's inevitable.
---
Vanilla meeting stones had one function: they allowed you to queue for a dungeon, and would form your group for you. Feel free to look it up if you weren't around in vanilla.
---
Okay, I've gotta clear this up because BFD is the dungeon every caster absolutely should run.
---
The wand from the quest there [Gravestone Scepter] is a 29 dps wand. FROM A QUEST. That you can have in your early 20's. That is the highest DPS weapon in the game for that level (I believe).
---
To quote Kargoz, "That wand is the **truth**"
---
19 is really boring. Yes, you're OP and can 1-shot not-twinks, but it's not that enjoyable. Your toolkit is small and there's no real finesse. 29 is better, but if you're willing to put the time in, 39 was my favorite bracket. On the plus side, you can get professions maxxed.
---
Because up vote and down vote is not *supposed* to work that way. Not between what you don't like and do like. 
---
People lie, no one believes the "my gf did x" posts that pop up a lot. That's why people are sick of such posts.
---
Although I recall in arathi basic jumping off the mill, popping the cloak, and floating right on top of the flag. If I recall correctly ou could cap the mill and land on the center flag less than 10 secondsa later
---
Man I play wow but some of you guys are serious nerds.
---
Most druid T2 is garbage anyways.
---
"Wish I had that much time at hand again now"
---
This is why I min-max. Idk why people assume it means no life.
---
I see it as the "give up on a good idea before Blizzard even had a chance to say no" take.
---

---
right. The poison would replace the sharpening stone, or vice versa. Crusader would stay.
---
Can we start removing threads about how others should play the game that come up every 5 hours?  apparently if you want to be some sort of efficient, you aren't having fun and must take a month to level!
---
Other players leeway
---
Lol I don’t think that ret paladins are asking to be let in *on account* of their unique characteristics.
---
I did not actually read it, I only skimmed through looking at words here and there and the allowance from the wife part is that struck out to me.
---
I think you nailed if.  I am sure people will go back and forth about it becoming dead if the in between time is too lengthy, but there is gear to be grinded and mats to stockpile for next patches.
---
I haven't played since vanilla. I'm going to call them specs because that's what everyone always called them back then.
---
DrDisrespect? Is that you?
---
I think in my case it's the fact that playing a mage just makes me impatient to get to max level at 40. It feels like you have 99% of your toolkit already at 40, so leveling stops feeling rewarding to me. I just want it to end cause I'm doing the same shit I would be at 60 if all I did at 60 was grind pointless mobs.
---
As someone who's done this route several times in practice over the past couple years, I beg to differ...
---
https://classicdb.ch/?faction=68
---
This list does not include several quests as well that give global Horde Rep, as well.
---
Either way, you still need cloth turn ins to polish off exalted.
---
I would prefer to see longer rollouts between each phase 6 months is perfect in my opinion.
---
Getting 3 piece is pretty nice, it ends up being something like 30 mp5 fully buffed
---
Kid(s): Dad can I play too? Isn't this game multiplayer??
---
DAD: NO ITS NOT THAT TYPE OF MULTIPLAYER NEWB ITS A MMORPG.
---
You realize you are squarely at fault here right? YOU determined that it was TBC or classic+, that we had to make that choice. You, yourself, made that assumption and that we had to make that choice. Majority people sided with TBC, which isn't shocking.
---
Let me help you out. Reframe your novella doctorate thesis to be purely in support for classic+. Don't even mention TBC, or other expansions, because its completely unnecessary. Build up a base of support for your ideas and the direction classic *could* take at a later date.
---
You arbitrarily created factions by making this TBC vs your idea, and TBC is going to win. You shot yourself in the foot and you are spending all this effort on defense for a problem you made. 
---
This is the realest advice you will probably get, but somehow I expect another ad-hom from you.
---
Uhm, there was no way to see someone's talents in vanilla, that was added much later.
---
Which reputations should we grind first?
---
Imagine the smell after a couple days in. Bleh!
---
Don't forget to pick up skull of impending doom. That quest also leads you into the badlands.
---
That patch right before BC where blizzard gave us early access to our class redesign talent trees in the vanilla wow world was basically Christmas morning for a lot of us druids. It was the first time our class felt like it had a clear vision and we had so many new toys to play with. I miss them days.
---
Depends on the specific phase and on certain thresholds. Phase 2 will probably come pretty quickly once the majority of players have hit 60. So around 4-6 weeks after launch. Phase 3 will probably be a longer wait and will happen when the majority of players have gotten deep into MC and things are stagnant while people wait for BWL and BGs. I'd estimate about 2-3 months after phase 2. Other phases after will probably come out every 5-6 months or so.
---
The nef fear can be zerker stanced dance to advoid it in the time it takes for him to cast the fear.

ZG Bat boss same thing as above

---
Fear ward only helps bad tanks.
---
Really? I coulda swore we could inspect them and see their talent trees as a tab next to their gear. I stand corrected.
---
KOS Gnomes !
---
But that's also the problem. People have heard that vanilla raids basically are LFR difficulty so they treat it as such, which means they are brain afk, show up too late, doesn't get consumables and addons. Vanilla raiding attracts the absolute garbage of garbage and that's what makes it hard. If everyone on your raid is at least awake during the attempt then you'll probably do fine with 40 meme specs. Actually I'm quite content that you can clear the whole game with only druids and paladin/shamans. It just requires people to be on the ball. That's why you see the hardcore players flying through the content on private servers. They are competent, focused, know their shit and buffed to the max. 90% of raids won't be like that.
---
Why are you recommending a dagger for pve raiding that applies a debuff? That will remove debuffs from raid.
---
3/3 improved blizzard? Doesn't that makes problem with cone of cold slow?
---
Hybrid specs dont need to be as good as the one-tricks in tanking or DPS. What they need is to either have situational advantages or expand into having a support role.
---
Let's take Prot and Ret Paladins as well as Enhance Shamans as examples here.
---
Prot Paladins should excel at fighting AoE or against undead/demons. From what I've heard, TBC did a good job at this, changing talents around and adding an AoE taunt so that prot paladins can tank 5-mans across the board, and in raids, sometimes they'll be the MVPs on certain situational bosses and other times they'll just be an off-tank or left to tank the trash packs.
---
Ret Paladins should be more like the "melee healers" which was mentioned to be what the Paladin was meant to be like, but leaning more toward the melee side of things. So perhaps Retribution would have their damage buffed (because a very well geared ret paladin with Sulfuras still probably wont be able to outdamage a warrior tank) and incentives to heal other players would be added. For instance, maybe a talent could give a mana reduction to a healing spell after getting a melee critical strike, or Seals of Light / Wisdom could be changed to also give party members a portion of the health/mana gained when a melee strike procs the Seal.
---
And Enhancement could be given more of a support role. Talents which increase the effect of buff totems should have even more of an effect (borrowing the Wrath of Air Toten from TBC which increases spell damage wouldn't hurt for Shaman as a whole, either). Parry should be made baseline in order to move Stormstrike up to the 21 point slot. In turn, Bloodlust (or a nerfed version of it) could be the 31-point talent, allowing Enhance Shamans to have some great utility.
---
As for the tanking side of Enhancement, I'm not quite sure how to solve that one to make it good but not homogenized. Maybe make it more of just a secondary tank in both raids and dungeons, while still having decent support?
---
Those are just a few examples I have to make hybrid DPS or tanking specs good without any homogenization or having too little of a hybrid tax.
---
already so many cringe memes on this subreddit it’s actually embarrassing
---
There is a cake next to your username.
---
Shit I thought innervate gave the whole team mana not just once person. I started playing at burning crusade so I guess this was an update?
---
Check out the addon called trinket menu. After you've used one of your trinkets, you can easily switch to another in a matter of two clicks.
---
&gt;I'm personally a fan of the idea of giving users 4-6 months of time between the release of each phase.  
---
I don't know if I agree that all phases should be equidistant, at least certainly not phase 1. The idea of waiting 8-12 months for the release of battlegrounds using your numbers would be completely hype killing for me. I personally consider World PvP to be complete dogshit, and the idea of farming ranks that way for up to six months would sap fun to such a degree for me that I wouldn't actually even attempt to rank.  
---
I'd be more for it if battlegrounds released in phase 2 along with the PvP gear, but beggars can't be choosers.
---
He didn't ask if guilds will accept him though. He was simply asking if the lack of weapon skill bonuses were noticable in AQ40 and Naxx, it's a legitimate question to ask when your trying to make your character as strong as possible.
---
I’m 20 and I’m playing it but I’ve been playing since the game came out thanks to my brother. I’m not sure how many other kids around my age are interested
---
It's not so much the damage difference of the racials that affect how thw guild will choose you, so much as the more hardcore guilds want players who put in their all, including minmax. So if they see a nelf rogue vs a human rogue, sure the baseline damage difference is there from wep skill,  it also says that the nelf rogue chose looks/flavor over minmax, and that says their priorities, so this can also mean they care less about minmax in general and when it comes to it are only pulling 70% of the humans dps because the human may have chosen that race purely for minmax purposes, and when you do that it's just the tip of the iceberg for how far you are willing to put in the effort for minmax usually.
---
Of course that isn't the case 100% of the time, but if you only have what the applicant sent in and it's basically just a random strangers word that they will act like what they put down, then you really just have to go on what isn't just their words, like prebis level, enchants, race, and of course, the big one, other peoples words, their reputation.
---
Lots of women play, but sometimes if you mention that you are a women the responses you get are stupid. That's why I opt to just never mention it unless you're in voice chat or something.
---
I recall a Rogue &amp; Druid combo in bg's named Master and Baiter.
---
Spoiler Alert!
---
Well then why are they whining that they have no time to play. Stop whining at everyone else who prioritizes game time over something else. These people made their choices, stand by them.
---
THANK YOU
---
Make this post again in two years.
---
You are not forced to play with swords. There is 2 speccs that are very good as daggers, combat-dagger and seal-fate.  
---
So if you plan on playing with daggers, no one will hold your racial against you.
---
I think what you want is a new game with the same principles as vanilla. Possibly a wow 2.
---
She isn't, she's a banshee. So a ghost. She's just making herself look like a physical being.
---
What do you want to do? If you're a garden variety raider you won't need to grind any reps. But if you want to go for certain professions or mounts etc then this question becomes important.
---
&gt;Back when Blizzard gave a shit about the lore it would have been very difficult to justify Necromancer Gnomes or Orcs.
---
We have orc warlocks and that makes 0 sense. Warlocks were responsible for the destruction of their world, the corruption of their people and their defeat in the First War. I don't see how warlocks were ever allowed into the

 New Horde considering their history.

I'm with you but fan art has little place here - fan art posted here would be better suited to /r/wow in most cases.

One thing he should know is druids excel if you can use their WHOLE toolkit. all the forms, all the spells, all the kiting and decision making. If he wants to go pvp druid i would highly suggest watching some of this lady's videos.

Thanks. Why improved spellstone? Seems like I see most warlocks using a staff.
---
Unpopular opinion: op is a retard.
---
on a serious note, new players are really unlikely to be browsing a sub for a game that hasnt been released yet. soooo.... op is still retarded.
---
The differences are definitely not marginal.  5 weapon skill is a pretty big deal actually and should translate to a 1.8-2.5% DPS gain.  More if the player doesn't go deep combat for weapon expertise.
---
That mindset is how subs make their way to the bedrock that is r/funny levels of trash. Letting upvoting manage content doesn't work, you need strict moderation by people who have a clear vison on how the sub should look.
---
Just by actually reacting to a post like this, you're already doing better than 80% of Reddit mods. You can change the sub for the better, I believe in you.
---
Thanks I will definitely do that:)

Heretic!!

I would take that totem spell damage change in a second, no question. Those are some good ideas. Mana economy changes and regen rates would have helped casting shaman and druids in particular. Shaman lacking a mana regen while casting talent didn't help, mana tide being locked at the end of resto didn't help either. But at a certain point pvp would become unbalanced, which actually is the case in vanilla when a druid is very good, or an elemental shaman has the skill and gear to match anyone. Having heals is kind of a curse. Another example, Shadow priests would be terrifying if they had better mana economy, and the mana version of vampiric added in tbc was nice for raids but didnt solve the problem of going oom every fight on pvp. But if they did solve that problem, spriests would be nearly unstoppable in bgs. Its complicated.
---
Check out PFQuest. Plots all quests and objectives on your map even ones too low level with min level and recommend level requirements

Majority won’t be 60 after just 8 weeks.

I haven't seen any of these posts, but this is the second post today I've seen complaining about them.
---
no.
---
Thank god as an future Paladin.
---
on your hunter you want engineering+whatever else you want. Can be anything. Same goes for your rogue. If you wan't to make money on your hunter then you can solo DMN or mara. That should be better money than any professions. If you want to twink your rogue he should have engineering too.
---
Damn I missed that. Surprising considering I’m on here for about 30 minutes everyday

Amazing work! Thanks for share!

It means "sitting" on the bench. we got 43 people tonight and 3 are sitting.

Yes release is German. Stress test was German. Everything is German
---
humans go down the path of least resistance. it's our nature. So no I doubt it. 
---
and as much as people want to make druids work. yes they are viable - but they remain far from optimal as they still end up inferior to a warrior offtank who can swap over to nightfall to increase the uptime -  or place that debuff in the first place.
---
Yeah I was looking at some threads from way before the beta happened, and everything was discussion about game mechanics, items and other content in the game.
---
Now everything is just casual dad gamers begging for attention and the UNFUNNIEST images I might have ever seen in my life. Consistently unfunniest, every one of these r/classicwow memes, I don't think I've seen a single one that was funny.
---
Are they good? I remember trying private servers back during wotlk and it was a bunch of shitty hacky nonsense.
---
1. yes as mt/ot depending on the fights (there are some fights REALLY not suited for druid tanks,  but they excel on others)
---
2. Cat dps, doable (much better on alliance as you dont benefit from windfury so kings/might is better)
---
The paladins best friend

Gloves, Legs and Robes/Bracers... Will last you a lonnnnng time through Naxx.

Blizzlike is around 3-4 months per phase.
---
If you have Hand of Edward the Odd, you don't need to bubble, just insta-cast hearth.
---
No it hasn't. Just go look at threads from a year ago or something, everything is actual discussion about how in-game mechanics work and shit.
---
Because if you play a game competently, you're clearly a no lifer. If you have endless hours to dedicate to wandering Azeroth and hitting 60 two years after release, that means you have a life. It's simple stuff.
---
Rambling hate posts against TBC make me sad because it was the best time in my WoW playing years.
---
I remember I rolled dk in WOTL the definitely an oversaturated class with some real morons out there that had managed the hit 80.  The shit for brains DK's absolutely gave the rest of us a bad name.
---
I am planning much the same thing on aliance  i want to take my time do every quest i can find keep up on all professions including secondaries.yea it will put me behind the curve but when i hit 60 i will be well prepared.
---
"TBC class design was great!" "TBC warlocks were shit" ok mang...
---
Those threads are written in a melodramatic way, but they aren't wrong. Nothing on retail feels satisfying or enjoyable, no matter how hard it is. It's just poor design.
---
Am I in Australia? Everything being backwards and shit?

Mute?

41 year old checking in. I also hope young folks (and old folks for that matter) check it out and enjoy it. One of my fears is that six months to a year from now the leveling zones will be as dead as retail because there will be no new blood. If more people play and like it maybe we can get a few good years of stocked levelers to find dungeon groups and keep leveling bg's fresh.

As for the toxic side, being toxic knows no age limit.

Are you being deliberately obtuse?  He's asking if there will be RP-PvP servers.  
---
Not regular RP ones.
---
Retail doesn't have PvP servers because of war mode.  Classic doesn't have war mode as it was introduced in the BfA systems patch.
---
&gt;you understood me
---
Correct, but that's because I understand what the expression means.
---
&gt;I won’t change it.
---
You don't have to change it, but you should know it's clear you do not know the meaning of the phrase you're using , which some people try to avoid (as it sometimes makes people look stoopid)
---
Google box machine works well though  if you want to know what you're trying to say  :D
---
He's been literally playing for YEARS mate, started at the very beginning.. of Legion. Basically the game didn't exist before then, so why even bother? Nothing o do with the fact his mum had him in bed before 8pm or anything, it was just scrub tier content

I raided in vanilla as a NE rogue i never felt like i made a mistake although i never did  Naxxi am sure NE will do just fine.

He was main tank vanilla through bc....warrior and druid

No, a couple means two.
---
What I'd like to see is them using all the old assets that were abandoned in the regular world.  We always hear about these foreboding places such as Karazhan Crypt that if they do decide there is certainly plenty of old world locations that could still be fleshed out.
---
Holy shit. This sub is filled with leftovers from r/incel ? Yes, people have wives. Yes, their wives love them. Yes, you are delusional for being butt hurt about this.
---
This type of design actually kills games. You can't require "old" content be cleared for new players to enjoy new content (unless it can be done solo). And if you never get new players, the game slowly dies.
---
To be fair, Leeroy Jenkins was fake. It’s not an *entirely* new thing.
---
When I say that "Cata killed WoW" I mean it in the same sense that anyone who hated Cata says it: it changed the game completely in a way that alienated a lot of players.  Obviously modern WoW is still financially successful enough to continue being developed.  However, the Classic player plays in general doesn't like the direction the game ended up, and Cata is probably the most notable change to the game.
---
I did play Vanilla from day one and I do not recall meeting stones ever being used.  If my memory is failing me then I would add it to the list of problems that Vanilla had.
---
I linked the quest. Level requirement for gnomish engineering is 30, not 35...
---
TBC seems to have been the peak of the game engine, game mechanics, etc. It'd be great to see a fork of the game with the WoltK etc content back-ported into the TBC engine, with zones adjusted so that 70 always remains the highest level.
---
Imo the biggest problem isn't really the leveling part, it's fairly easy to get around spending money while leveling, but once you're a fresh 60 the demand for gold skyrockets. Not only do you need to swing the first one thousand on the mount, but all the enchanting+consumables+prebis requirements all come into effect at once, assuming you have a guild, which imo is a lot more demanding and trickier to balance than leveling.
---
You don't understand that it's been beaten to death? Lol
---
Im specifically interested in vanilla because you can get away without minmaxing
---
We've never had true communism.  Stalinism was a self serving despotism under the guise of communism so he could justify putting the people through such hell as "it's best for Russia" when he never put himself down to an equal level.  Just an oligarch screwing the people.
---
True communism is probably unachievable but the best path for it would be a democratic system where the rules and weights of the system would be decided by the people.
---
Any Totalitarianistic version is against the point entirely and becomes just a contrived Monarchy.
---
It will be the same as private servers, connected &amp; try-hard players will get opportunities in semi-hardcore guilds, actual hardcore guilds will tell you to fuck off well before you ask to meme, and casual guilds accept warm bodies so have fun there I guess.
---
I love, every single one of these stories. Thanks for sharing.
---
Not in practice. Or he would’ve said 2 months.
---
40 is only 28% to 60? Yikes...
---
What about 3-4 warlocks spamming hellfire with 26% chance to stun for 3 sec per tick? Would that Comp work for spell cleave, no mage? Figuring the stuns would be enough
---
Unpopular opinion: let people play how they want to.
---
Think of the smell! You haven't thought of the smell, you bitch!
---
Up to 500ms delay between issuing commands to your pet and the pet executing it. It’s not batching, it’s just as broken in BFA.
---
The DMT is just for in between bosses, so you can connect with the inner spirit warrior within yourself and convince him to fill you with his power moving into the next encounter, and have his mighty magic powers strike your enemies to the ground. The blow is just so you can digest your food faster and take less shit breaks and naps. Everyone knows world firsters sell Elf lap dances on the dark web for free blow, in between raids, duh.
---
Me not really i care more about class fantasy and what mounts each race get more then anything. I do not set my leveling routes to maximize xp per hour. I used to play that way i have learned just kick back and enjoy the game. Min/maxing just causes stress from my perspective.
---
"I'm awake I'm awake...Anu dorah"
---
You completely missed the fucking point
---
Why don't you chucklefucks go make your own subreddit where you jerk each other off over how your wife let's you play 2 hours a day and how amazing that is. Or how she's getting you treats to make you feel better about how little you "get to" play (because that's what this is). What are you, a dog?
---
Any man with their integrity left finds this shit cringe. It's pretty pathetic to need permission to play. You're an adult, do whatever you want. Not a topic worth discussing.
---
Interesting read! but i was trying to say in reality the best system is a combination of DKP and loot council.
---
Some people will complain but im sure the majority of players will not come anywhere close to exhausting their options in game. Worst case scenario level your bank alt up to 60... Totally a fan of the slow rollout idea.
---
Kinda like how your mad about posts LUL
---
Dude I called dibs to repost this last time it was posted.
---
Right, because it's playing the game. The other ones are just to wait for 2 minutes until the buff is out, then get back to playing. I still think the significant clear time, especially if you're bringing people unfamiliar with tribute runs, is going to be the most annoying.
---
FOR THE... hugrouten?
---
Ret Paladin has most dps
---
Shimmering flats is in Thousand Needles
---
Yes in practice. Or does your girlfriend tell you and two other men you're a couple at the same time?
---
I'd say at least 5 days out of every week at least one or two mods are discussing moderation in our Discord, e.g. was I too harsh, should that have been removed, can I get a second opinion, should we change how we approach X type of posts, etc - so, although I'm the mod currently replying to this, I 100% guarantee that we're constantly trying to improve our moderation of the sub.
---
Truth is, the sub got huge, and quickly. When I joined in February/March 2018, the sub had I believe &lt;20,000 subscribers. Just prior to BlizzCon 2018, it had about 35,000 subscribers.
---
The sub has added over 120,000 subscribers since November last year. That's a great thing as I'm super excited to know that there are so many people excited for Classic, but at the same time, it had the mods like **o_o** in regards to having to adjust our moderating practices (especially the influx of memes).
---
We appreciate people bearing with us while we figure this out. Shoot us DMs via ModMail if you have moderation or overall suggestions, I'd say we respond to at least 90% of them, if not all of them.
---
I'm gonna play the game with my wife and we're going to level together, plan on picking what talents I like and going about leveling where the next quest takes me. If you want to min/max then neato have fun but I have no desire to do in depth research of a 15 year old game.
---
I quit 2 months into BFA. Very recently I reinstalled, but stayed unsubscribed. I ran around town on my high pop server on a trial character (high pop according to the server list).
---
Trade chat was very very quiet. Maybe one person saying something every 2 or 3 minutes. I looked for people near the bank, that were actually from my server and not cross realmed. It was difficult to find anyone from my server, maybe 1 in 15 people. The vast majority was cross realm, giving the illusion that Stormwind was moderately active.
---
It was really kind of sad, I feel like the numbers are probably way down. I wonder why they haven't done more merging.
---
On private servers? I don't recall this discrepency at all in classic.
---
The Beast will never have been skinned if you needed Master rank to skin. I never pushed deathray, but I don't see any "master" requirement on it.
---
You can use your spellstone to give you a magic shield. With the talent, that magic shield is 1170 damage. The entire spec is built on 1v1 cheese and isn't really useful in team fights.
---
Yeah you'll find some things like "What class should I make, I'm thinking Dwarf Priest" "oMg FuCkInG mInMaXeR jUsT eNjOy ThE gAmE lOsEr"
---
I don't care about minmaxing either, just playing what I want.
---
But if someone's fun IS from having the more powerful race/class combos, why are they getting shit on?
---
Same thing goes for anyone shitting on someone else because their race-class combo is sub-optimal.
---
Luckily a nelf warrior is good enough racial that no one shits on me but because of rage gen problems in the late game, I don't get called a minmaxer
---
She's not a regular undead. She's a banshee inhabiting her own corpse. In a world where we can raise the dead and heal all manner of injuries I don't find it a leap in logic that she'd posses a magical way of protecting her meat suit from decay. She's dead but that doesn't mean she's rotting the same way regular undead are because she isn't a regular undead.
---
He's the typical reddit retail baby.
---
Since you are speaking specifically on class design, yes I will agree TBC was amazing in that respect.  The homogenization of classes was not apparent in TBC.  All I tried arguing was that class identity began to take a back seat to balance, and I don't think it necessarily has to be a complete either/or.
---
What I would be way more concerned about is adding in daily quests, flying mounts, an isolated 60-70 only separate zone, and most importantly removing the possibility for newly created content which moves the game in a new direction from what we've already seen happen.
---
thats 2500 dmg per **100000** the very definition of marginal... Pick it if you want, if I ever went alliance I would be a human mage, arguably the worst class as human and it wouldn't bother me 1 bit. Instead ill be casting frostbolt on beast bosses dealing 5% more dmg, at a 40% faster cast rate, so pick whatever race you want and that's fine as long as you know you are wrong if you didn't pick troll, mon.
---
Lol stop using the word cringe. You saying cringe is cringe you fuck
---
I can't believe I actually decided to remove the part I had about paladins and shamans not being included because I'd be pointing out the obvious. Little did I know I'd overlooked a second even more obvious thing that still doesn't change the fact that TBC was designed and intended to be launched on an existing platform rather than an entirely fresh server. I get why you'd want them standalone but no transfers, at least at the launch of TBC, makes no sense.
---
That's horrible.  Where could I find this porn, so I make sure not to look at it?
---
I could only Imagine 2 days of fementing piss and shit
---
You keep spamming "ur so offended lel mald" memes, missing the point that you are spamming this thread defending your idea vs TBC when that's the situation you artificially created. 
---
You're either shitposting or way too young to be using the internet unsupervised. I think its bedtime lil guy.
---
That makes a lot of sense. It's just always been my experience that I have to watch flags.
---
Where the fuck did you actually get that from? She was a regular banshee and reclaimed her body during Warcraft 3, which was also described in novels and other lore pieces.
---
Jesus, you're right...
---
No, your wife treating you like they own you is cringe. You letting someone walk all over you like that is cringe.
---
Little cringeboy.
---
Im not saying that's what I want lol, I would love classic+, Im saying what the devs would rather do
---
No. Get these people out of here.
---
How much of a DPS increase is +5 weapon skill going to give with swords for the average joe in MC or BWL gear?
---
Min/maxing goes to far when you stop enjoying it.
---
I enjoy it a great deal, but am willing to deviate whenever I want to.
---
Main example is liking big numbers, but liking the classic hunter more. Not that it isn't still a vital class.
---
Sure.  
---
The game will be very popular at launch, no doubt. 1 million unique players divided between realms with 3000-5000 playercaps would mean ~200 realms.  
---
What do you think will happen 1 month after launch, 6 months, etc? People are gonna drop off, especially from a game that as time consuming as vanilla wow. Playerbase is gonna be spread thin, with some realm being complete ghost towns, not so good for new players to join into.  
---
What's gonna be the solution to that, realm merges? Which would mean name collisions and bricking the realm economy. Or do you suppose we split servers and have Thrall 1-20, which would just be sharing the same action house and name database, but still separate the players from each other, because why? It's not like all your grudges against layering is solved with split realms, its merely a lite version of it.  
---
Or we just have layering, realize the reality that classic will never be able to emulate vanilla completely, and trust that if layering actually introduces significant problems that blizzard solves them (it's not like adding restrictions to layer hopping is difficult).
---
Yeah, I guess you're right. It's not like the dude with the dress is Freddy mercury by any means but Nhym is decidedly without talent imo.
---
Hahahahaha holy shit. I never said my wife left me little notes of dumb shit that I can guzzle down when I play video games. You’re assuming. My point is why do you give a fuck if someone else’s does.
---
I haven't heard anything since the statement by Ion a few months ago. I'm still holding out hope they change their mind and give US one realm.
---
&gt;You can’t keep a paladin cced lol. Bosac eats your cc. 
---
BoS can be dispelld, purged, or devour magic'd. But honestly, against any dps class, the paladin is almost dead weight anyway.
---
&gt; That’s why spriest + mage is probably the only thing that gets close due to offensive dispel on bosac but you better time that sheep fucking perfectly with the dispell or it’ll just get reapplied.
---
I mean, like I said, any two dps classes can pretty much ignore the paladin (except for spell interrupt or silences). Especially spell casting dps classes. If you do want to cc the paladin as spriest and mage, just sheep the paladin and then dispel the BoS. It doesn't require amazing timing, it just requires you not to attack until you finish dispelling.
---
&gt;2 mages? Rofl - with no offensive dispel you better be able to kill the war in 1 gcd. And unless both mages massive outgear the war I don’t see it.
---
Two mages destroys warrior/paladin combo at any gear level. The paladin is almost useless before two pom pyro mages kill the warrior because mages have two counter spells not including grenades and other trinket interrupts.
---
&gt;Basically pally war has 2 main weaknesses: offensive dispel and manaburn. No priest, no chance of winning 2v2.
---
Warrior and Paladin basically auto loses to any two dps combos that have cc's as I've said before. Paladin has one bubble to get heals off that most dps combos can survive. After the bubble wears off, the paladin basically can't get a cast off before the warrior is bursted down.
---
Sound like you might need a girlfriend, op.
---
Ok I'll keep it concise then.
---
Them &gt; you.
---
Update: There was no healers, I went resto. Life was changed. Once a healer, always a healer.
---
What song is that?
---
Oh no, retail players, the horror. Shield your eyes!
---
My argument goes beyond just playing Classic.  Classic is the obvious starting point that pretty much everyone could get behind.  I think the best solution would be to eventually create new content from there, rather than to follow a pattern of re-releasing expansions.  I'm just providing my reasoning.
---
Most of them are whining, absolutely. I've seen many threads/posts recently about these people trying to justify their playtime with "It's the only way to enjoy the game, you aren't even enjoying it if you speed level to 60 and tryhard".
---
Most obnoxious fuckers on here, champ.

Hahaha. Yes, don't even call her by her actual name 😂

Finally, a chance for r/classicwow, captain of the wow Reddit’s, to show his quality.
---
I just want to say this:
---
I hate resilience so much.
---
I hated it in 2007 and I hate it now.
---
Please.
---
&gt;I miss the vastness, the endless feeling. That was purged by flight.
---
amen
---
Really good stats and drops from Ragnaros. Arguably you could wear them all the way to T3 or even keep them for the 3-set.
---
If you are looking for casual relaxed gameplay go rogue.
---
The difference between a "perfect" rogue and a "not paying attention" rogue is maybe 20%
---
The difference between a godly druid and a good druid is already like 50%,  and a bad druid is worth like 20% of perfect.
---
And it's a LOT of experience effort and grinding to become a godly druid.
---
You're obviously the one getting emotional, here.
---
Hey Gloves, to do well as a Druid in PvP takes being able to utilize everything (skills, movement, items, consumables etc). There’s pros and cons to this: good Druids really shine, but take a lot more effort to be effective. It’s not so straight forward like some classes, but I will tell you they are INCREDIBLY fun once you get the hang of it.
---
I’ve played Druid from OG Vanilla up to BfA, I can tell you off the bat that Druids in Classic are VERY different from any other expansion (even BC, they fixed some issues to make Druids more viable).
---
If you want more info, I don’t want to shame-plug but I really want to give more insight on Druids in Classic to those who are wanting to play the class. 
---
I just posted a video of me (Druid) dueling Sonydigital (Rank 1 warrior) in the $7000 Classic Beta dueling tournament. It’s a review that goes into depth. Keep in mind it’s level 40, but the principal of druid pvp is the same at 60 just with more abilities.
---
Here’s the link, I hope this helps! Goodluck :)

Here's the questgiver, here are the levels when it's worth doing, here's where everything spawns, here's where you turn it in...

Getting a jail break run was like pulling teeth
---
She repossessed her body months after her death. Unless she found a way of *reverting* massive decay - which she also isn't sharing with her fellow forsaken - she should look like a monster. Which also was Metzen's [original vision](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/wowpedia/e/ee/Sylvanasstitches.jpg) of her.
---
Some guy randomly pits his idea vs a beloved wow expansion and then spends the rest of his time flailing about in comments calling people mad when they disagree with him.
---
TIL its my fault this guy can't present anything in a positive light.
---
This is awesome man, I’m sure he’ll appreciate this. I’ll shoot it over to him now. Thanks chief.
---
Blessing of sacrifice can be dispelled, purged, or devour magic'd. Paladins can't get heals off vs interrupts and silences unless it bubbles. If paladin bubbles, just outlast or reset the fight.
---
I played from vanilla through wotlk, played on 3 private servers, and was on one of the top teams in several seasons in TBC which introduced resilience.
---
Healing in 2v2 is only viable with resilience. Without it, your dps can ignore you and burst your dps down in the blink of an eye.
---
Just honestly think about what a paladin is going to do vs 2 mages when his heals are getting counter spelled, grenaded, and interrupted through other mechanics.
---
You're kinda assuming that any spell cleave group has excellent and prepared players. Like u/Hakurai mentioned in the video, spell cleave is extremely binary. Either it's insanely good, or insanely shit.
---
It's high risk, high reward. High risk is a high liability on your +12h grinds.
---
I'm sure you're correct that there will be some insane lvl 60 times for a few spell cleave groups. But tonnes of spell cleave groups will fall apart. People underestimate the preparation required. How easy it is to wipe and make the xp/hour, plus the morale, really shitty.
---
This right here cringe police.
---
If I could pick a class maybe? At this point I’m just going to log on and sit in the character selection screen for hours.
---
Ive been playing video games since i was 8.. ive always wanted to be as good as i possibly can, and get as far as i possibly can.. idk where all these people are coming from with this mentality? Literally everyone else i know is the exact same way
---
Anytime brother, best of luck
---
You see, the Draenei are aliens, and Area 51 raid is coming already which will solve that, so thats why I think you should join me in classic + because TBC has dead aliens. - OP
---
r/wow is hilarious you shit on their casual gameplay and they get touchy.
---
They run so weird though.
---
:/
---
So my rule is this: I create a loose plan, just with things I want to completely make sure I do/remember. The rest of the plan is "do whatever I want"
---
The plan includes a few specs, both those that are "optimal" (like SM/Ruin), and those that are either specific or for a fun take on farming (Demonic Sacrifice Enslave Draintank).
---
I have a list of some areas to grind for each cloth, but also include the general level ranges for each so I can just wing it.
---
There's a BiS and near-BiS section, but the main part of that is just the things I can craft, because I would rather farm cloth and do dungeons for fun as much as I can for whatever slots I can get away with.
---
Basically, I create a bullet point plan, not a step-by-step
---
Did someone say  \[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker\] !!!!
---
Hunter and warlock both being super strong levelers would put you in a good spot if you have any interest in some of the tougher/slower to level alone classes (assuming you're leveling together anyway). Or you can just be an altoholic like I inevitably will be haha...
---
Honestly, this entire thread you come across as super condescending. If you have so much going on, spend less time preaching on a subreddit and more time getting your house in order (maybe literally?).
---
Meanwhile, there was news a month ago of Blizzard cancelling two projects they were already working on to focus on Overwatch 2 and Diablo 4.  They have finite resources.

GL my dude , my friend group we are looking at warrior(me) , priest, Hunter, mage, lock , paladin. All dwarves and gnomes lmao we gonna fuck shit up in Stv

Make 1 mistake and it’s all over

Weapon skill doesn't do anything in pvp, so what are you saying?
---
Cringe
---
Only time racial matters is dwarf priest vs others.
---
That's way too long. Phase 2 will be like 2-3 months.
---
I believe you I started bike riding last year and lost a good 10lbs pretty quickly but then plateaued. I gained the weight back. Then after giving up sodas I lost the 10lbs again. I want to eat healthier but it's actually hard to do now. It's crazy how back in medieval times only rich people could be fat but now our whole diets revolve around processed crap loaded with preservatives and other junk and now you have to be wealthy to afford to be healthy.
---
Yes, how dare people choose an option they prefer.
---
The thing is, raids that allow meme specs don't exactly attract A-players. If you are really good at the game and spend hours and hours on consumables to fuel your raids, you expect everyone else to do the same. At that point a meme spec just can't follow and you end up carrying them. Personally I don't quite like this way of thinking. As you said it's more about the skill than what class you're playing, to a point. It is very common among hardcore players though and that causes problems from guilds who want to allow meme specs. 
---
A-players can either choose a guild who only allow the most optimised setup for easier and faster raids, or a guild that chooses to nerf themselves just so a few people can play something different. That's how they view guilds who run with meme specs. So if you're creating a guild from scratch or nearly scratch you kinda have to be extremely stern with the meme specs or good players will pass you by.   
---
This is of course completely retarded because as you say, a meme spec can pull his own weight while contributing to the raid in some fashion. If you dropped four dpsers in one of the best guilds and replaced them with equally competent ret/boomkins of course they would still clear the content as fast. At that point it isn't a problem, getting to that point is the problem and it's almost impossible while allowing meme specs in the raid. 
---
The guild we will run on Classic is made up of many players we've played with through the last 3 years on private servers and as such we already have a team of A-players. Therefore we have spots for a feral tank, feral dps, boomkin, prot paladin, retri paladin and shadowpriest. We know that if we put competent people on these classes they can actually be useful and we have the players necessary for still clearing raids efficiently. This is where meme specs can be appreciated, but these guilds are very rare in my experience.

&gt; The 4chan threads on /v/ have much better content than this sub and it’s sad.
---
Are you insane? Do you filter out all the wojak edits and asmongold pictures?
---
Work on the kiting and don't backpedal to kite.
---
I think the gear upgrade bit is closely related to the concept of making old content obsolete.  The release of Naxx meant you needed to progress through dungeons to get decent blues, then MC, then BWL, then AQ to take on Naxx.  Upgrading your gear in the process felt good.
---
The release of a level cap increase means you skip past lvl 60 dungeons, MC, BWL, AQ, and Naxx to replace all your elite gear with regular solo quest rewards.  This process doesn't feel as good.
---
But the core issue is making older content obsolete instead of a continual progression to aim for.
---
Perfectly fine with 2-3 months until DM, gives those who want to finish MC without DM gear overshadowing MC loot. Roughly 6 months per raid phase is fine but I think the time between phase 3 &amp; 5 shouldn't have a year gap just for ZG.  
---
The issue I feel is the PvP phasing, I really don't like the idea of the honor system being all world pvp only for months, I think they should drop AV &amp; WSG in a mini patch between the 2 so people who want world PvP will find plenty and those who want to rank can go into BG's and have their fun too.

He's the douche because he isn't stealing time/money from his employer? Super weird take, but ok.
---
I have a big boy career and while I could probably get away with gaming some at work, I wouldn't bother because that would mean sacrificing responsibilities on top of being an asshole stealing from my employer/company. 
---
Not everyone works at a souless corp making crap money with no loyalty to speak of. By all means, if you are being paid minimum wage, you do you and put in whatever effort you feel that is worth, but those attitudes kind of run in tandem in why you are where you are in the first place, no?

Yes.

I'll take unique, original anything over some of these reposted memes. Yes, we get that over a decade ago paladins thought they would not be healing bitches... Its not clever anymore...

A good hunter crafts Nightfall and spams Wing Clip on the boss, only moving out of range to cast Tranq Shot on the 5 encounters that require it.
---
the huntard stigma is too strong. you could be the best hunter in the world but the majority will still see you as a huntard.
---
Its pathetic but I dont see it changing unfortunately.

&gt; How can she still be a banshee if she got her body back, she can still turn into some ghostly ass smoke and go through walls. How can she do that with a supposedly physical body?
---
Is that from the same cinematic where Anduin revives half an army with one spell? Maybe that's not to be taken that seriously. Regardless, Sylvanas returning to her former body is mentioned in the Arthas novel and in a [lore text from 3.3](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Major_Characters_in_Icecrown_Citadel), if not in other places.
---
love the bars at 1:37
---
actually a classic
---
It's mainly not repositioning into a mob patrol, managing your pets growl and position, knowing what items you actually need, not running out of ammo and not breaking cc with multishot.
---
The answer is literally in the question, my dude. 
---
"I have so much going on, I don't have time to play a video game" on said video game's subreddit. That's damn near the definition of condescending. Sorry if you disagree, but it doesn't make it untrue.
---
Same
---
Here's the thing. Like you summed up the differences between vanilla wow, classic, and current wow very succinctly with talk about design philosophies and how the modern game has very different design philosophies than vanilla or even tbc did.
---
And that's fine. No ones arguing that. Or at least I'm not arguing it. The philosophies driving modern wow and the ones that drove vanilla are very different even diametrically opposed in places.
---
Where I'm going to put the brakes on here is this idea that a lot of classic proponents float that these philosophy changes occurred in some kind of game design vaccum. They talk about things like staff departures or budgets or acquisitions or ipos like they are the sole reason that these philosophies changed. Like thats the whole reason the developers decided to start doing things, in some ways, completely opposite to how they were doing them even the previous year.
---
Game design is an iterative process. When you start to design your game you and your team do what "you" think is fun. What "you" think players will like. You put it in beta to find bugs but also to see if your design philosophies align with your player base. Then based on player feedback you start making changes to the game. You monitor responses to those changes, you make other changes. Someone at a university does a research paper on your game and several competitors highlighting similarities and differences. One of your competitors rips a chunks of subs out of your hide. Technology advances. Design advances. Designers better understand what players as a whole consider fun. They start weighing the options between designing for a core dedicated audience or a more fickly general audience. A decade later, if your game has lived that long, it's a very different animal than it was previously.
---
And that's fine. It's FINE. Stuff evolves. Wow has been through a decade of this iterative processing. More so than pretty much any video game in history. So yes. The current game design philosophies are very different than the team had going in on 2005.
---
But that's not a bad thing. That's fourteen years of learning, feedback, tuning, adjusting, constantly trying to keep the mix fresh but also engaging to legacy players.
---
Where I think a lot of the proponents of wow classic err is in believing that the design principles of 14 years ago are somehow superior to what the games industry has learned in a decade of design. And these designers don't work in a vaccum. They don't homogenize a class because they feel like it. It's based on player research. Peer studies. Competitor data. Market trends. And finally and ultimately, the almighty dollar. The fact of the matter is that wow is still insanely profitable. So much so it swallow its nearest seven competitors whole, profit wise.
---
Your argument that 14 year old philosophies are better than modern ones is hollow. The player base as a whole, the millions of subscribers, the people who buy xpack after xpack, prove you wrong.
---
Ultimately, you are in the minority. You "prefer" those older philosophies, and again I'm not arguing over which is better or worse, only over which has been more popular. I'm not going to make the pitches that you are nostalgic for a feeling that classic isn't going to recapture, I'm not going to point out the dozens of holes in the logic of various classic cheerleaders. I'm not going to say that bfa or legion or wod or pandara or cataclysm or wrath or tbc or vanilla was the golden age of wow.
---
I'm just going to point out that the majority of the subscribers. The overwhelming majority, in fact, prefer the modern iteration. You are a very vocal minority that Blizzard is catering to as an experiment. And in half a fiscal year or maybe as long as two fiscal years, when classic is no longer profitable, they will pull the plug on the experiment and say "whelp we gave them what they wanted and no one stayed subbed" while they kick out 9.0 xpack for another fifty bucks an account.
---
Life, people, change in over a decade of time. You are talking about things like the world getting smaller because of fast travel or portals or meeting stones, but what about cell phones and discord? Do you honestly recall vanilla wow. You were lucky indeed if your guild was large enough to have a TeamSpeak server.
---
Do you remember calling your friends house wondering if they were home yet so you could go hit Dire maul? Well now you know where they are 24/7 and what they are doing and reaching them is instantaneous.
---
Wow classic will never feel like wow vanilla because the world's a different world. And trying to shoehorn in 14 year old design philosophies in a modern world would be like trying to apply 80s economics to moder society. It worked then because of a unique combination of factors and its not going to work now for the same reason. You aren't even the person you were then. Everything in our world is near instantaneous these days. The internet, our food, our entertainment like movies. Everything is at your fingertips.
---
And in your nostalgia you are going to crash head first into the cold brick wall of frustration with the many many flaws classic wow has.
---
I'm of the same mind Blizzard is. I'll just wait and watch when it dies. Not smugly, because I'm not a dick. I want you to have fun. I really sincerely do. But I know it's not going to happen.
---
The better you become as a hunter, the more you will be called a huntard. It’s a no-win situation.
---
Yes I know this, I was telling another person that there will be no Rp pvp servers, and there are no servers ever labeled “RPPVE”, those are just called RP servers. But that’s fine go ahead and bandwagon with other into a conversation you don’t know about.
---
Where's the problem again?
---
I wasnt aware anyone was taking Nhym's raps that seriously. I always thought it was just a parody, created by a WoW player that sounds like your average WoW player.
---
Yeah 25 replies in 12 minutes, most of them calling you a huntard. It's hopeless.
---
Take old school runescape as a good benchmark. The game starts out as it should be then morphs with the growing player base forever changing the game through the years. It’s impossible for devs to keep a game true to its roots and will always be that way.
---
Why is that condescending? Are we really just pretending that there are plenty of people who don't have time to play shit? I never claimed to be one of them, I said I had 15-20 hours a week, same as the dude I was talking to. I wish I had more but let's be real, there are people that have 0. It's not some "excuse". A lot of people just don't have time to play these games.. especially not like they did 15 years ago. 
---
I never thought I would see a world where saying you have shit to do so you can't play the game you love as much as you want, or trying to say that there are plenty of people out there with even less time would be "condescending".. but I guess we are in that world and I missed it.
---
Meanwhile calling it an "excuse" is cool. At the end of the day, this just does not make sense to me lol.
---
I posted a funny / bad battlestation and got it taken down. What do you think of that?  
---
Complete w/ "horde good" handdrawn sign
---
Idk what you mean this guy always gave that quest that required you to go to ZF and kill Gahr.
---
He just said "Enjoy walking the whole way there". Like yeah we know it's a trek to Org and then a trek from Brill to Deathknell but you certainly don't only walk since you take a zep lmfao
---
All great points. 
---
I think another type of guild that could run meme specs is the “I used to play more hardcore but now I only have time to raid once a week” guild. I think there’ll be a lot of people back for the nostalgia factor and only do limited consumable grinding like Tubers and Demonic Runes. Players like that might try different specs than they played in Vanilla. I’d argue I’m one of those players, I’ll be playing a class I didn’t touch until MoP and am purposely not playing Rogue and Priest who I played to death in Vanilla.
---
In a guild like that the player may not really care too much that it takes a month or two to kill Ragnaros.
---
There will always be some discontent when underperforming players/classes get loot they don't "deserve". It might not be vocalised publicly, but will be there.
---
If I was a guild leader I wouldn't allow meme specs. There's too much potential for drama, and no real upside. Well, I guess an upside is that you get a VERY thankful and VERY loyal moonkin if you invite him. But then you're taking a chance that all the other ranged dps are fine with carrying the moonkin AND sharing their loot with a meme spec they are carrying. Personally I just don't see it being worth the risk and the hassle.
---
None, because proponents of classic+ keep shitting the bed with posts like this. 
---
Build up the idea first, outline why it's so good instead of trying to compare it things that are already outlined and believed to be good. You're taking a noob idea and putting it up against a tried, tested, and clearly understood idea, and making a surprised pikachoo face when people choose the seasoned idea. 
---
"Guys, we have a choice. My way may or may not have pavement, who knows, I havent told you. Where does it go? I don't know. But over here we have a tried and tested superhighway that everyone loves. That's it boys, its my way or the highway."
---
For reference, I have seen other posts talking about classic+ and what that could mean, and I was certainly interested in the idea. Yours is the first post that made me dislike the concept.
---
Great tips, thanks! What do you mean tho by raising the succubus again by a priest? Are you using it to dps too?
---
The huntard problem is it's such a damn easy class to level.  But once you hit max level lack of skill shows.  Learn your proper rotation, and keep your pet on a tight leash and you'll be fine.
---
Because they do. Any class that is already using casting gear and get cast speed reduction will do some damage. Druids get it plus another with crits. Its also the best MT healing spec for resto druids anyway, so there is no loss for the primary spec. Trying to do this is feral HotW means your tank is weaker, your dps is weaker, and your healing is weaker. And this from a class that already is the not great in all those rolls. Stick to 2 rolls as a druid and do your raid a favor.
---
No. I want an addon to show me where to get quests. I don’t want the addon to help me do the quests
---
I dont remember if it was on the books or the game, but I remember somewhere saying that she was revived by the dreadlords, which managed to restore her body to how it was (almost, they couldn't take away the blue-grayish colors of her skin). She comments exactly that when her body is given back to her - that it's beautiful as it once was, but now blue.
---
So even if she was ridden with maggots, somehow the dreadlords managed to restore her body.
---
And they probably used magic so that her body didn't decay afterwards. Remember that dreadlords are immortal and by ressurecting her they probably wanted an eternal ally too.
---
Most undead are running around with bones sticking out and jaws missing. So to follow this assumption, we have to believe that there's some special ointment that can reverse corpse decay that *only* works on corpses taken over by Banshees, that was also never mentioned in 15 years of WoW because we just made that up ourselves. Or we go the simpler route of saying that Blizzard just wanted sexy Sylvanas without caring about implications.
---
And in the end, *at best*, Sylvanas is *still* a disgusting corpse that is just well-preserved.
---
I specifically don’t want objectives, that’s where I’m running into problems. I only want quest starts so I don’t miss any.
---
&gt; A lot of people just don't have time to play these games
---
Cool post, thanks for sharing.
---
If they're new to the game I don't think guides will help them as much as you'd think. With a game like classic wow it's so easy to get sidetracked because it's a game that takes time. New players I'd say will get sidetracked easily, and because the game is very sociable I can just imagine new players ditching their guide as soon as they start grouping for elite quests etc.
---
This will still happen when Classic launches.  Someone not taking a Resto Shaman to heal a dungeon is just an extreme version of someone denying an Enchance Shaman a spot in a raid, if they aren't the optimal pick for a certain situation, people will deny them the chance to even try. This happens all the times in competitive team games like League of Legends and I have seen it bleeds over to pretty much every multiplayer game I have played. The worst part is that most of the meta choices by the top end of players only applies to those really high level players and anyone in the bottom 90% of players would just be better off playing what they know.
---
You can try to avoid it, but I am willing to bet around half the groups in Classic will deny the nonviable raid specs for dungeons and maybe 10% of groups will be even more restrictive.
---
This is why I was really hoping for a RP-PVP server, I want to roll on a RP server because I bet this problem will be significantly less severe, but I want to roll on a PVP server because it sounds way more exciting overall than a PVE server.
---
Rogues are stupid-easy to play in Classic.
---
Keep up Slice and Dice, make sure you have poisons on, and don't energy cap. That's it. Those 3 things account for &gt;85% of your damage.
---
There are fringe builds like Hemo, but they're not particularly good in PvE, especially with limited debuff slots.
---
As opposed to none. The min maxing hardcore group can't hurt you, don't worry about them.
---
And there is absolutely a third group, skilled players with limited time who don't require every consumable in every attempt. Maybe instead of crying about min maxers you should work on improving your own skills to get out of the 99% scrub group.
---
Then why are you discussing it? :)
---
How about we let people decide what they do and don't want to see on the sub by implementing some sort of system where people could vote on which posts they like and don't like?
---
2nd paragraph is spot on. This sub is chock full of retards who think they know something about vanilla without having experienced anything from it in at least 13 years.
---
That was pretty much our guild on ND. It was a continuation of a hardcore guild on Nost and LB, but most of our A-players wanted to take a break until Classic. So we decided to be a casual guild with meme specs and all that. We did MC and BWL fairly easy, ZG was easy, but then came AQ40 and it really showed how bad some people are. Needless to say, we didn't get far. So the top players eventually started to bleed out, whether being poached by better guilds or just quitting entirely. Soon we couldn't even do BWL regularly and at that point we were rapidly bleeding the few good players we still had until the guild eventually disbanded and took a break until Classic.
---
But if you are content with just doing MC and BWL then that's fine. IMO they are pretty fun raids whereas AQ40 is a terrible raid. In fact I wouldn't mind staying on BWL/ZG throughout phase 5 and then go directly into Naxxramas in phase 6, but that won't happen.
---
My advice if you want to try a meme spec is to try it as an alt. Go with your main into MC/BWL etc and once MC is being farmed regularly ask if you can bring your feral druid in there, just for a change. Most likely they will say yes. Impress them with some good numbers, make sure to always innervate the priest officer (and announce it in yell with a macro to drive home the point), and eventually you might actually be allowed to switch over.
---
6 months between phases, would make it last longer than original Vanilla. 
---
6 Phases, should be around 14-16 weeks each.
---
Any links to resources to host? Thanks!
---
&gt;As for the toxic side, being toxic knows no age limit.
---
It is known
---
Blizzard has already said the server names will be new. It wouldn't make sense any other way.
---
Which includes blizzard telling us there’s going to be new names lol
---
No one knows at this point since it’s been radio silence since the last time.
---
They are in bfa zones. Why do people write how they are shocked that there aren't more level 20s in stormwind? The game is 15 years old and a new content patch just released. Players are gearing 120s.
---
pretentious how? what wrong information has he spread?
---
my wife said "You better not play that stupid fucking game" so i said okay. But I play ESO and will just reroll to classic wow and she wont even know.
---
heH
---
you may not actually look like that but the feel is still there though
---
That's like saying I want to be a fish, but not get wet.
---
&gt;The release of a level cap increase means you skip past lvl 60 dungeons, MC, BWL, AQ, and Naxx to replace all your elite gear with regular solo quest rewards. This process doesn't feel as good.
---
I would argue that if they didnt increase the level but instead just put it out as 60 content people would eventually STILL skip MC BWL simply because the items would eventually get inflated on there own as we moved though the raids. Having 4 raids makes it so that people will run old conten when you get to 10 raids of the same level i just find it hard to belive that people would not start at some middle point unless you basically only had raid drop gear. At which point it would be easier to just join in pug raids where people ran lower content for money.
---
I do agree that raid progression is important and intra Expansion raid tiers should be used always. The BFA reset is garbage and what they did in Wrath with the double raids was even worse overall. If they must have harder raids there should be 2 raid tiers Normal and Heroic. Both raids should require you to have groups to go with and not a raid finder. At best people should learn fights as it feels far better to EARN loot than it does to just be given loot.
---
Questing in the older expansions was always a means to an end. Legion and BFA it never felt right because of the story or the fact i got a peice of gear that wouldn randomly roll to be far better than what i had. In some cases better than the instance loot i was getting by a wide margin, in one that i just did. Theres no fun in winning the lotto over and over. For that i think that the gear in TBC and Wrath even from Purples didnt feel bad to me. As it was all for that progressive purpose. The loot in Legion and BFA never felt good because it wasnt progressive, it was luck and there is no accomplishment for luck.
---
In general, Thorium Brotherhood will be the most useful from phases 1 to 3. Totally depends on your class and professions though. Timbermaw and Argent Dawn both have some unique patterns that you might want.
---
That's what I thought seemed weird to make a mini guide for each one.
---
pls
---
&gt; Having to run to the dungeon creates community. It makes you appreciate your friends and guildmembers, and it makes the world more active when players are running from the city to the dungeon (Running. Not flying above everyone else)
---
Genuinely curious how does it create community?
---
For me, the running and waiting just makes me bored and takes me out of the game while i afk/watch tv/do something on second monitor and occasionally glance back at the game to see if i'm running into a wall or everyone is ready. Having to wait on people could even be detrimental as you get fed up with them wasting your time.
---
Are you sure that you get a 26% chance to stun every second? 
---
Because the first thing I found in a search was a wowhead comment stating "A deceiving talent, the 26% chance to proc being spread out over the ticks of our two channeled AoE spells. "
---
I have not tested it on private servers, let alone the beta, but are you sure that hellfire actually gets a 26% stun chance every second, rather than per cast?
---
My gf just had a stroke, I am all set
---
You can see lack of skill in leveling dungeons as well. A good hunter is a great addition to a run. A poor hunter wipes the group repeatedly, more so than any other DPS class.
---
Hey. Thanks for clarifying, what you said does make sense with the added context.
---
Old thread but wanted to input that I've leveled shaman like 4 times to 60 in vanilla and in pservers.
---
I like to go 1-32/34 as enhance and then swap to elemental. The OOM thing always felt over rated*(especially when you can dip into the totem talent in resto later)* when you compare it to the RNG slot machine of enhance. 
---
When I get chain lightning and a few intellect pieces I like to pull 3/4 mobs and AoE them to death. Sure I can do this only once or twice until I need to drink but killing 6/7 mobs in 90 seconds compared to killing 3/4 *(depends if the RNG gods favor you, and if they don't you spend mana shocking)*. 
---
Plus a 2H staff and you can still kill just as quick in melee as enhance imo. Obviously you will do less damage but I don't think its as insane as dedicating a whole tree to when you can dump 50/60% of somethings HP and finish it off with shocks/melee rather than relying on RNG procs, crits, and hoping your 3.8 second swing timer doesn't get parried, missed, dodged or glanced. 
---
Long story short I'd recommend giving elemental a go. It was loads more fun than enhance to me and I make it a point to only go enhance at levels 20-32/34 for improved ghost form until chain lightning. Its honestly a whole different class if you level as ele and only know enhance.
---
I'm in the same place. We should hang
---
I kind of like the old junk pictures. Other than though I agree
---
Also delete the  'hurrrrrr i couldnt pulla out a driveway and now have 6 kids how am i gonnnnnnna ever hit level 60 without all of them dying of neglect durrrrrrr" posts.
---
I guess the irony is that while I’m arguing for meme specs but I’ll be playing an optimal one most likely. Frost Mage or Resto Druid, I’m still not 100% sure which.
---
Yeah let's make sure this sub sticks to posts asking "am i the only one that's going to take it easy this time around because i have 46 kids and can only play 15 minutes a week" and the same questions about PvE or PvP server and alliance or horde.
---
Not sure, actually. That would be v gimp
---
The sub has been nothing but the exact same reposts for years. The increase in memes is a symptom of the fact that everyone is just waiting for launch. We're out of things to talk about it. It has been done. 
---
There is a reason that the beta/release date announcement bombarded the sub so hard. It was the only 'new' thing. Hell, people were datamining the beta. Yeah. "CHECK OUT THE MODEL OF MANKRIK" as if we'd never seen it before. That's how desperate it was.
---
Once it has launched, you're gonna see people posting their lucky world drops, ninja loot videos, pvp videos (and if they don't have watermarks, overdramatic zoom-ins and twists on floating numbers, and terrible music you're obligated to downvote them) and screenshots of boss kills, etc.
---
All this to say that the sub will increase in quality for about a month or so, and then will go right back to where it was at. The same crap everyday, just with pieces of spinach stuck in it instead of corn.
---
Sorry.
---
*Should have.
---
Thank you, bye.
---
I need more
---
It's the highly vocal minority I worry about more. Pserver players have progressively shortened their patch release schedule because they have leveling and raids down to a science (and will adapt to the minor changes easily).
---
I suspect Blizzard will keep it balanced across the averages but the vocal minority do raise a stink these days.
---
&gt; When I say that "Cata killed WoW" I mean it in the same sense that anyone who hated Cata says it:
---
"I'm entitled and Blizz wasn't catering to me so I left and STILL bitch about it."
---
Same shit with every expansion. People constantly bitch and moan about everything in this game. You're no different.
---
Cata didn't kill the game. The game passed it's peak just like almost every other game out there. The fact that people are still playing WoW 15 years later is... impressive to say the least. I came back a few months ago (left during cata) and was impressed with the activity.
---
I know I love it.
---
Prot pally is a legit thing 1-58. Can quest, farm, and tank any dungeon easily otw to 60. At 60? No way. 
---
Druid tanks will absolutely be a thing.  Even and especially at 60.
---
We will certainly see plenty of ele shaman. Shadow priest. And more.
---
But no prot pallys past lvl 58
---
Typical huntard not doing his own research.

I'm going to minmax a lot my meme builds and I won't minmax what is already good.
---
I'm very competitive when it comes to my builds vs what everybody uses. My plan is warrior main, druid alt. Probably just get a build from internet for my warrior and not to think to much about it, and for my druid try a lot of things, time my mana usage, etc.

A lot of healing gear is good for Elemental. Zandalari Hero Charm is one in particular that is very good for both. Natural Alignment Crystal too. But yeah, don't expect to get a Choker of the Firelord.

This is a great idea with only one flaw. Need to play on a wired connection. Have to somehow get an Ethernet cable plugged in to an old persons router or something and attach some sinkers to it so it stays on the bottom. Brb putting my house on the market.

That’s how PvP sounds too, right poisons, get the jump and stunlock em
---
&gt;The vast majority was cross realm, giving the illusion that Stormwind was moderately active.
---
Stormwind and other capital cities don't crossrealm on their own, they only show players from certain connected servers which are effectively combined into one larger realm, where you can join guilds in any of the connected realms, trade across them etc. (eg. khaz'goroth/dath'remar in oce). 
---
There are some NA realms that have like 5 servers connected together because they are all dead, so you were likely not actually playing on a high pop server at all, hence all the different people from other realms. 
---
&gt;I wonder why they haven't done more merging.
---
Connected realms are basically a realm merge without all the bullshit that comes with it like screwing player/guild names
---
Is this a joke?
---
Shadowpriests are mediocre at best in 1.12 meta.
---
They get outscaled by all casters after t2 and are overrated
---
Warriors are almost certainly the class that’ll die the most during levelling tho?
---
I'm honestly really disappointed that they're not going to have BG's at launch. very disappointed
---
I always level as ele when I get chain lightning. I feel like as enhance you rely on RNG too much (flurry procs, hit chance, dodge, parry, miss, glancing blows...with a 3.8 second swing speed it makes me want to kms), and if you happen to not roll lucky you usually spend all your mana shocking it to death. 
---
At least with elemental I can pull 3/4 mobs, kill them all, and maybe have another smaller 2-3 pull before I need to drink. Its very consistent imo. Kill multiple mobs quick &gt; drink &gt; kill multiple mobs quick as opposed to kill 1 quick &gt; kill 1 slow &gt; kill 1 slow &gt; oom because had to use my shocks &gt; drink &gt; kill 1 slow &gt; kill 1 quick.  
---
I don't know why people say its slow either. I frequently get decent leveling speeds to 60 on the servers I've tried. I remember on K2 I got 60 in like 5d 8h or so, and I had a few hours afk logged in, and did my route sub optimally but was still one of the few shamans to 60. 
---
Plus its dope to hit 60 and have your heal set already started and ready to go. It aint gonna be pretty but its better than the melee gear you leveled with and other pieces in the bank you could have vendored.
---
I wish they were phase 2 , vanilla didnt have bgs at start but 1 phase would be ok

honestly, I'm kinda hoping that blizzard drops wow 2 in VR as the tech allows for it, I kinda see them wanting to do that because MMOS will only truly come back in force with VR imo
---
would be the perfect way to let wow as we know it finally "end"
---
Not if played duo with a healer
---
I can't figure out when they were added, oddly.
---
But that is great news.
---
know when your suppose to dismiss your [pet.it](https://pet.it) doesn't matter if its your first time and nobody told you to dismiss it if your pet ass pulls and wipes the raid you're a huntard.just dont bring it out if youre not sure and make sure youre pet gets buffed(might/kings/juju str and AP s if youre hardcore).Get all possible world buffs and consumables before a raid
---
Not with a personal healbot. Solo however they survive as well as a black guy in an 80's movie.
---
Druid healers are not sub-par. Vanilla mechanics are not very friendly to them though. 
---
HoTs don't stack - only one Regrowth and one Rejuvenation are allowed on one target - so while you might be one of the strongest healers in the raid if you are the only Druid, your value goes down when more Druids are added. It's only class in the game with diminishing returns.
---
People will love you if you make yourself known as that one Druid that everyone wants to have in a group. Playing a Druid will be more competitive than most classes, but if you're up for the grind then it will be very rewarding.
---
My money is on the first 3 days will be a disaster, Blizzard has a good track record of that so far.
---
But after that, it will be absolutely fine.
---
Are you talking about about modern WoW? Because moonkins definitely aren't lagging behind atm
---
Two weeks?  I thought we were 5 weeks away.
---
It seems everyone has forgotten, or maybe they weren't around to know in the first place, but...
---
As a shadow priest you will melt faces in pvp
---
Will lowering graphics settings yield more fps? Yes
---
Nice post. Thanks for the insightful information.
---
The Holy Emperor Of Mankind denounces this HERESY!
---
You lost me when you said gnomes are ugly :P
---
I predict 3 months per phase. Fast enough to keep people interested, slow enough to provide plenty of content/longevity. Slightly faster than Blizzlike in 04-05, but not too fast.
---
As a warrior this means like 34/35 cause fuck scorpions and turtles, vultures are cool though.
---
You have to re-up, Classic is free to all active WoW subs.  So no getting to play one without at least the POSSIBILITY of you playing retail, sorry.
---
Why do you need a wired connection? Wifi 802.11N is more than powerful enough with extremely low latency. Wifi is perfectly fine.
---
[another thunderstrike that nobody will roll on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjmJCy1ksYY)
---
Yeah I tend to agree, after having looked into it a bit further. Additionally, those 58-60 elites are supposed to be pretty hard to farm as a priest (by yourself). 
---
Might try give it a shot but prob be of little value
---
Asking for recommendations on where to do research.  You’ve outdone yourself with that ability to change the context of someone else’s words to suit your mood.  Bravo. Tip mah hat to ye.
---
Here’s some tips on how to stay in shape while playing video games for 21 hours a day.
---
Basically anything that keeps the cables out of site. The IKEA Signum rack is what a lot of people use - it mounts to the underside of the desk. You can get a power strip, throw all the cords out of site, and the only cable that can be seen is a power cable. 
---
I use a mixture of command strips and Velcro loops to keep everything tidy.
---
&gt;and when you come out you have friends
---
Depends on how the run went!
---
I think this thing came from the reward bags in Silithus during the AQ gate opening events...
---
[Colossal Bag of Loot](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=21528/colossal-bag-of-loot)
---
I wouldn't pick him because he picked gnome, no other reason. All gnomes are kill on sight, even for alliance.
---
They are creepy little fuckers.
---
So you are enjoying modern WoW.  Good for you.  This post was for those that don't like modern WoW.
---
Think about other group members
---
Players generally don't attack each other unless they believe they have a big advantage. There's no real reason to do it other than just for fun. Sometimes it might be over a resource node though or a rare mob, those battles are pretty fun. They are more common at level 60 though. 
---
So keep in mind that the "glorious world PvP battles" will most likely be a gank fest. 
---
I don't particularly enjoy ganking, unless it's a mage, but I love the tension you get when you see a red player in the world. That moment of consideration as you try and figure out what the other player will do. Will he attack me? Can I gank him? Does it have friends? Level/class? Can I trust him to leave me be if I don't kill him? Etc. And once you get those even fights it's really fun and extremely intense. 
---
Another thing is defending lowbies. Quite often you will see people screaming for help in various channels and you as a proud paladin of the Alliance or an honorable warrior of the Horde, heads out to defend the peasants. I urge you to answer the call because it's such a fun ride and you get a bunch of whispers by everyone in the zone. If you do it a lot you become known as 'that guy' who defends Redridge or whatever. That's really cool imo. 
---
Or you can be known as 'that guy' who camps Redridge, whatever floats your boat mate.
---
you... you can summon him outside of r/freefolk?? 
---
We are mere mortals under the God himself.
---
I find the leveling experience exhausting. I offer ways for people to get through such a massive, agonizing grind much easier.
---
For players that enjoy the level grind, great. They won't click the guide links or read the articles anyway. 
---
World of Warcraft was a very painful, suffering experience when I played vanilla. Leveling took a VERY long time while working part time and trying to improve my health to rid myself of inceldom. Being smothered by normies who would keyboard turn, not read articles on how to do raid bosses, insisting we spend weeks / months figuring out fights on our own due to their own stubborness. 
---
The extreme supression of the "top guilds" who had most of the game's content on literal lockdown that if you didn't toe suck and beg to be part of their guild you were pretty much stuck as an outcast on low pop servers. All the while feeling cursed for being a min wageslave incel with no friends. 
---
Why should anyone ever suffer through any of that? Cause it's "fun?" The fuck it isn't. The only enjoyment siphoned from this game was the agony I could bestow on others by camping low level zones.
---
So when someone offers a most optimal way to reach that goal so that I can extract enjoyment from the game I take it.
---
Just paid $150 on my credit card on Friday.
---
I'd be maxing that bad boy out again real quick.
---
I agree. 6 months is fine for the later phases, but imo battlegrounds need to be out sooner than that, especially because they don't drop until phase 3-4. That's 1 year for AV/WSG and 1.5 years for AB.
---
If you and your priest friend are on the same schedule and play together this could be really good and not have much downside.  If not it'll be tough to do any solo grinding.
---
Druid. Level feral, both of you have move speed boosts.
---
I wouldn’t recommend tipsout’s content in a hundred years, guy has no clue what he’s talking about. 
---
I don’t know about Kargoz’s leveling guide, but the lvl 60 pve guide is as good as it gets. It covers about everything you'll need to know and he consulted multiple high profile hunters before/while doing that guide. 
---
Hunter discord is also pretty decent, just ignore the doomers.
---
Vanilla was a slow painful grind.  It built comradery, you could solo, but a group of friends was really the only tolerable way to do it.  The running, the running was endless. The flight paths are slow.  It made things feel bigger though.
---
Personally tbc was the golden age.  Serious class weaknesses were addressed, but still had some of that original flavor.
---
By cataclysm the game definitely didn't feel the same.  It wasn't bad, but not the same.
---
also i don't give a shit about your shitty tattoo
---
A warrior and priest can pretty much name an instance and run it, not hard to find 3 willing dps.
---
Yea!!!  I don’t wanna hear about your supportive partners in life and general happiness!
---
And this is why we have layering
---
Aw shit. Here we go again. r/freefolk  leaking as always. 🤣
---
No time for alts. One and done.
---
The new players are in BFA.  Just us old farts for the most part.
---
I had a friend that never could decide on talents. He basically did the same thing, but occasionally spent some points. He always had like 5 to 10 unspent. This was at launch, so the idea of mi/maxing want even in our heads at the time. We just laughed at him for his indecisiveness.
---
but what will we do without our female panda porn
---
What about gear? Do I need separate gear for all the different roles? Cuz getting multiple sets of gear for raids would be nearly Impossible.
---
&gt; So you are enjoying modern WoW.
---
Eh its ok. I just don't feel entitled enough to claim that ALL OF WOW FAILED because Blizz didn't do what I wanted. WoW is fine.
---
Also, it's possible to be excited for Classic and also find BFA fun. This all or nothing attitude is bullshit.
---
I didn't miss the point.
---
Your point was getting a tattoo about something that had a big impact on their life.
---
I said if playing a video game had a big impact on their life, that's pretty sad.
---
Just because your point can't defend how awful video game tattoos are doesn't mean I missed it.
---
I'm looking forward to playing with a more mature, older community of gamers.  Most of us who played back in the day are now married with jobs and kids.  A lot of bullshit that flew back then won't fly these days.  I think much of the community just wants to have fun with Classic and relive the experience in a more easy-going way.
---
Want to hear an **actual** unpopular opinion?
---
Min-maxers can have fun in the game.
---
As someone who will be leading a guild (NA Horde PvE guild on a PvP realm, raid times yet to be determined) I have to state how hard it can be to find those people. They don't just fall out of the sky, yet you need them to. I'll start seriously looking when the realm names come up, but finding someone trustworthy ain't easy. I'll be the guild banker, I can manage inventory with a publicly viewable spreadsheet so no biggie there. I'll be the main enchanter aswell. I'm not paranoid, BUT I've trusted the wrong people in the past, so I feel like putting bank and enchanting guild mats on myself isn't crazy.
---
Finding the Raid Leader, backup RL,  Class Leaders (that part could be more organic, so not much of a concern), Loot Council Leader, and misc Officers are the most important part of the guild. And honestly, it scares me a little. I was in a guild back in Legion that had an officer play the long con. He got to know everyone, was very nice, rose through the ranks after months of being helpful and knowledgeable. The second he got the high officer rank he robbed all the most valuable items from the guild bank and left. That one event is what worries me, though banking won't be a problem. Perhaps I am a bit paranoid, do you have any advice about that?
---
my melee group did already a lot of test runs. even though a spell group has a higher potential, melee is a lot more reliable and durable. keep in mind you still have to grind a lot and are prone to mistakes the longer you play. melee is a lot more forgiving.
---
for example on lvl 42 we got to just shy of 50k xp/h just about 2h per level (for comparison joanas record time at 42 is 3h)
---
wouldn't say we are "wasting" time. projected time to 60 with our numbers is about 3,5days played. including fairly decent gear at 60 I'll take that over 5days solo questing
---
I fucking slightly dislike people who use cringe in their daily vocabulary.
---
There’s good fan art and bad fan art. In fact I would say there are way more shit memes than shit art. The guy who drew his fake beta experience in paint is high quality content. The guy who painted Ironforge is high quality content. If you say it’s cringe you’re just trying to be edgy.
---
It's just cultural. The Night Elves worship Elune and have a priest class associated with that religion. The Paladin class was created by humans following their religion and worship of the holy light. Dwarves presumably learned it from humans due to their close alliance with them. Gnomes are atheist nerd bois so they don't have a priest or paladin class. 
---
Night Elves had been secluded for a very very long time they stayed in kalimdor and humans stayed in eastern kingdoms. They never mingled until the events of Warcraft 3. I believe chronologically Classic WoW takes place 3 or 4 years after Warcraft 3. An ancient culture of elves who are thousands of years old aren't going to follow the cultural paladin class of the humans and dwarves in just 3 or 4 years. That kind of cultural intermingling would take decades if not hundreds of years to gain traction within elven society.
---
Undead can't be paladins because Paladins were immune to the plague so there wouldn't be any. Furthermore forsaken have been cut off from the holy light, that's the whole reason they call themselves forsaken. That means there wouldn't be any undead becoming paladins after the fact.
---
Undead priests canonically belong to the cult of forgotten shadow. A shadow priest organization created in response to being cut off from the light. They can play holy spec in game for purely in game reasons. You couldn't limit undead priests to only shadow spells they'd be completely worthless in game.
---
I presume undead have priests because the horde desperately needed a second priest race other than troll and it doesn't make sense for orcs or tauren.
---
I'm going Horde this time around, but if I were going Alliance I'd definitely go Gnome warrior. And I'd call her Tankini.
---
yeah, but not efficient. you have to /lfg wait till everyone got there, leaves after 1-2runs, need to find another, people expect to do boss runs and not only trash for 12min and reset... etc
---
big difference in dungeon cleave grinding for levels or running a dungeon or two to get away from questing
---
Literally the second I can log back into WoW will be the last moment I even consider coming back to this subreddit.
---
I wouldn't say they won't.  Someone in this thread linked to Ion talking in an interview that phase 1 and 2 are going to be pretty set at a couple months a piece.  After that, it's going to depend on how progressed the community is.  Really, they have the data from vanilla.  Let's say that BWL was cleared by 10% of guilds by the time AQ40 gates event started.  They could do a similar way of % population progression releases.  But then they need to put in something that stops them from releasing it too fast.
---
I still say, if anything, keep to the vanilla release schedule at the slowest.  More so, just stick with that release roughly speaking. I don't want them slowing it down anymore.  I still think that's too long in itself.
---
Although, it could get them started up on doing a TBC: Classic this year and then release it in 2021.  Projected release of Naxx based off the old release schedule would put that at march of 2021.  Guilds will be further progressed, on average, compared to vanilla release.  That gives 5 months to clear Naxx before TBC: Classic is released in August and then rinse/repeat in another 2 years with WotLK: Classic.
---
But I wonder what happens when they start releasing any new/fresh servers for Classic.  Will they stick each server with the same gated progression that we have with release day classic servers?  Or will they all just start out at the current phase of progression?  Does that mean any new server after phase 6 is going to start at phase 6?
---
I'd be really interested to hear about life at 60 for shaman. Like many others I plan on healing to get the ele gear if I go shaman. I might just go lock and Dps to avoid the hassle though.
---
What do you think Reddit is for, honestly? Go back to 4chan then.
---
Has never been charged it if Shadowmeld by a Warrior before.
---
Masturbate
---
"I know server names don't mean much in Retail"
---
*cries in every time someone calls me bad for playing on Tichondrius Horde*
---
You can't undervalue spirit bond enough, it takes nearly 5 minutes to heal just 50%
---
I feel like getting bwl/aq out in 3-4 month periods then 6month for naxx would be nice.
---
Just name 5 things about tanking in wow that he says which are false, name 3 factual things that can be criticized.
---
Mages destroy shadowpriests in 1.12 after AQ40
---
Mages do 3-4K dmg in 3 globals between 2500+ frostbolt, 1200 fireblast into CoC.
---
Shadow is great until t2+ when the spellpower coefficients  reck them.
---
For me I love the Min/Maxxing style of playing classic.  Personally min / max is where I find re-playability in any game.  I truly find the idea of working towards high efficiency and fast speeds in leveling to be the most exciting part of the game.  And next time trying my best to min / max even better!  My "journey" might be shorter in time, but its no less valuable or involved in the game.  Just as my journey is not the right way or better than anyone elses'!
---
I love classic just for this. In the end we are lost in a world, full of mystery both in lore and sense of adventure as well as in a unique set game mechanics and understanding.
---
You destroyed me with facts and logic. Please help me get gf. 2d girls just don’t do it for me anymore
---
2 tips I have for you.
---
1. Get a cat and make it stealth in dungeons so it doesn't pull crap.
---
2. Master Crowd Control. Hunters have an ice trap they can lay and then they can pull an enemy into it and it will be frozen in ice and can't move. You will have to reapply ice trap whenever it wears off every minute or so I think.
---
Master the crowd control and don't accidentally pull enemies with your pet.
---
Do these two things and any group will be happy to have you.
---
I went ahead and did a little bit of digging into the matter and am really surprised I hadn't seen more on this!
---
Dagger fury is definitely not optimal from a personal standpoint, but it's definitely viable and arguably an optimal usage of loot distribution. Gearing up your non-orc/human furys with daggers appears to be a really efficient usage of those weapons that also limits competition for swords on your rogues. +Daggers is significantly easier to itemize for than +swords/axes early on which is something rogues don't have to worry about.
---
Obviously losing out on the ww damage sucks, but a troll with daggers and berserking is pretty damn scary during execute phase.
---
For the players Classic+ is a fantastic concept that I and many others would love.  From a business perspective Classic TBC is considerably cheaper, easier and faster and will placate a large portion of the community, driving subs.  Sadly that will be the bottom line, I can't see Blizzard going the OSRS route of making new content for a classic version of the game while taking the time and care in working with the community to ensure that the new content doesn't compete with existing content.
---
It's already a problem. You have Sargeras in the US Central region, Sargeras in the French region, and Sargeras in the Chinese region. No need to complicate that further.
---
What is this, Simon says? 
---
Take a hike
---
Hunter by the end of beta was rolling pretty smoothly. The pets are still buggy, but here’s hoping it’s fixed for launch. 
---
However compared to pservers you will need to make some adjustments to your play style. Pets are lower DPS, and not as ‘snappy’ as pservers. Also, weapon DPS is adjusted to original vanilla values. Overall you will find it a slower experience, but so will everyone else.
---
Purple thot is exactly why female night elf
---
This is the most retarded thing I've ever read on this subreddit.
---
..what?
---
It is not repeatable.
---
Honestly I think this bait goes a bit far, but definitely a successful rustle
---
Easily a 9/10, just shy of a 10/10
---
Very impressive, but taken too far towards the end.
---
You’re upset. Relax. I’m making a point that all these dumb notes are either fake or cringe. I don’t know any adults, especially married couples, who write notes for video games. If any of them are real, it’s just an empty attention grab. I made one post about it. I’m not bent out of shape. Part of me actually loves reading them because I get that surge of “cringe” and it’s entertaining. You’re looking too deep into it buddy.
---
The resurgence with Seth Rogan today to boot.
---
Lol calm down. You are definitely right. That shit is retarded, but the whole “wives” in quotations part is kind of cringe. 2000+ upvotes... I’m going to guess there is a good chunk of incels in there. Womyn so bad though bruh.
---
I'm sure you can do all kinds of client-side hacks in Classic. The question will be is it worth risking your Blizzard account over that sort of thing? Even cosmetic modification can still get you flagged/banned. GL HF!
---
Questers will still almost certainly beat people doing spell cleave. If you're not doing huge pulls the exp/h is trash. Questing is consistent and only reliant on you. Spell cleave relies on four other people.
---
&gt;I got mad because you didn't just listen to me and do what I say and wanted some kind of explanation or proof, just hate this random stranger because another random stranger said to hate him.
---
Simon says you're trying to character assassinate but don't have a spine enough to take a risk and be wrong, nobody said Skarm could fuck their sister or babysit their kids, I said it was okay to listen to him talk about a video game. Show me on the dolly where he touched you.
---
All that matters is; the Orks think he's real
---
Replying with ‘this’
---
Wasn’t even a “radar” for anything.
---
You guys honestly sound like you got bullied your whole entire life, all of the words that you wrote on that small paragraph is full of salt and jealousy. He doesn't blacklist them to impede them, he just wants to play like a normal dude. He himself said he doesn't want streamer priviliges and would rather want to play like a normal person and is considering NOT STREAMING AT ALL. So in the end you are just attacking a successfull streamer because you are just so fucking jealous.
---
Why are you so butthurt that Skarm is a dick and his information of bunk? Get over it.
---
Cannot reply back to a "no u"
---
Therefore your argument is invalid and this conversation is over. Rip you.
---
ayo same
---
This was me during vanilla
---
I min/max my min/maxing because I'm not a filthy casul
---
That's... blatantly false, unless all you want to do in the game is get to 60 and run some dungeons.
---
just roll based on pvp racials IMO, since pve is a joke
---
I did do it during TBC, but I didn't know it had been nerfed.  One circuit through the zone took me about 15 to 20 minutes.  Being a human Paladin (rep bonus, crusader aura) helped cut down the time.  It was over a decade ago, and I was extremely sleep-deprived by the end, so I can't provide much more info than that.
---
What does your leveling difficulty have to do with rotations? You almost never use any dungeon/raid rotations when leveling no matter the class.
---
^
---
If you leave early you forfeit your buy-in
---
so I did a bunch of googling for this cos I used to use Tmorph to play as undead despite rolling orc. 
---
Apparently a few years ago there was sweeping bans for people using edited models  because of the potential to use the models to make things more visible. These bans were made possible afaik by the software Blizzard has now that scans your computer when you play. 
---
Would be good if someone with more knowledge could chime in cos that was the extent of information I could find by googling, I'd love to roll orc and play as undead again to have the best of both worlds
---
Its been a while but rogues get really shit on by warlocks in vanilla because no cloak of shadows so 1 dot and they lose a lot tools. Warriors could be hard but in MC gear if you manage to land a charm on them in zerker stance, CoElements them and soulfire followed by shadowburn basically 1 shots them.
---
S E N T I E N T
---
&gt; Skarm is a dick and his information is bunk? 
---
Tell me what is bunk, I listen to his videos to learn about tanking so I actually care from a hobbyist standpoint. You want to have your cake and eat it too, not fair. (also you were reading every comment, we know this)
---
We don't really know because plenty of people who are not crazy in the online community here will play and make a character without even thinking about something as metagrindy as oversaturation.  Plenty of Ret Paladins incoming.
---
Its is safe to say that rogues warriors and mages will be the most popular simply because they are the classic fantasy rpg archetypes.  That being said, I would not be surprised if we have a much more balanced class saturation than you'd think.
---
She's a model
---
I mean it’s mildly irritating but idk if i would take it to that level. It’s all for everyone; I just don’t get why people do that, like to show off, make themselves feel better. Just seems weird.
---
I really hope they don't make the first two phases faster. phase 2 pvp is the main thing I'm looking forward to.
---
everytime I see "petition" on reddit, I cringe a bit.
---
Totally lol
---
Hopefully they'll go through wrath and end it before cataclysm screwed it all up!
---
I feel like you won't be able to tell the difference between 30 year old players and 20 year old players.
---
It's all manchildren either way
---
The constant posts about how everyone is changing their lives to be a sub for classic and melee leeway bs has pushed the cringe envelope far enough. There isn't much else you can do to make it worse.
---
The original design philosophy is actually not different now than it was in Vanilla. The original philosophy was "EverQuest, but easier to get into, easier to solo, and take out the dumb tedious stuff and make the combat good." They just kept on taking out dumb tedious stuff and making it easier to solo.
---
Different people like different parts of WoW for different reasons. TBC is likely different enough from both Vanilla and current to survive on its own. Honestly the only argument against it, assuming it runs parallel to Classic instead of replacing it, is that you're afraid it's better than Vanilla and everyone will abandon the game you like for it.
---
Troll is the best warrior anyway.
---
What's Stigma?
---
Stigma balls
---
Gottim
---
that's fine with me, I just don't see why they had to stack the honor so much towards them. not to mention bg weekends and getting honor for losing games. in my perfect world you'd get the same honor doing world pvp as you would in any bg
---
Just never look at gear. Any upgrade for you is better on actually anyone else. Also dont have a pet its 80% of your usefulness and 100% reason your tank's wife left him, just check it at the door.
---
In all seriousness just do your best and have thick skin, rolling hunter means you're gonna be blamed for everything.
---
Classic+ bruh. Fuck these expansions.
---
No. It rules. I spent the last year of Vanilla playing a gnome fury warrior and loved every minute of it. Got every non-sword/mace weapon drop basically for free because none of the human warriors wanted them.
---
I'm pretty sure there's a point where SF Daggers is comparable to Combat Swords. It's definitely towards Naxx though and combat probably still is technically better. 
---
I'd much rather play SF though. Combat in vanilla is boring as hell.
---
How do you have more subs than all your vids have clicks combined?
---
It actually makes a lot of sense just bc you didn't read the whole post bc there are lots of words doesn't mean it's rambling.
---
2 viewer most of the time. They have it open on their pc and phone!
---
All those fun expansions, every single one
---
Play the fckin game the way u want neckbeards be damned
---
Honestly, I hate playing gnomes because it always feels like all my fancy gear is wasted on them.
---
Look at them. They're like, knee height. What is that Gnome wearing? Nobody cares because they can barely see the bastard anyway.
---
It can't be used in combat.
---
I'm confused as to how you're expecting your members to interact with the system. All of it through a website? Or the discord bot too? I'm telling you now, if I have to go online and submit a form stating how many peaceblooms I sent the guild bank, I'll probably just throw them on the AH instead. I don't see how you'd be able to automate the gathering of that sort of data. Unless an addon is possible, the best-case scenario for your guild seems to be that the one in charge of the bank account is the one who records the data but that's a lot of shit for that guy to have to deal with.
---
It's a lot of cool shit and I respect the effort, not trying to shit on you with any of this.
---
Your post sound amazing and will hold true for casual guilds, sure. But any group that's taking itself somewhat seriously will just recruit what they need.
---
The guild I'm helping to run has a maximum of 4 slots for "memespecs" and ideally we're hoping to phase them out. It's selfish to be carried by individuals playing appropriate specs and then complaining when you don't get gear. It causes drama. 
---
But ya, for casual guilds? Go nuts.
---
Yeah but still not. Because everything is doable without a dorf priest. It's just a qol change for the raid.
---
Glad to hear it, I was hoping it was a relaxing vibe.
---
Did I stutter?
---
I'm considering rolling an orc warlock. How does stun resist play out in PvP? If a rogue tries to sap or stun me and fails, will they lose stealth allowing me to open up on them? Are there any other fun considerations for an orc warlock?
---
I kinda like the goofiness of them but man, I also secretly wanna be an edgelord undead...gah I just don't know!
---
For a rogue it's not. Because they get 6 from talents and only the first 5 is very significant. 5 more after talents, like for human rogues, only increase your dps with like 0.5%
---
no to both
---
Haha yeah I haven't quite mastered Asmons technique of making 10 minutes of content take an hour and a half to cover.
---
I agree with this. PvP is my favorite part of WoW and not having bgs sucks, I’d like to try out to together a couple low level ones while leveling but it looks like that won’t be much of on option unless I wait until phase 2 to level. And tbh if I hit 60 and collect some basic gear and still have to wait over a month to hit bgs I’ll probably barely play if not stop until they come out. Not that it’s all I ever do but it just feels like one of the biggest things I love in the game is missing.
---
Agree 100%
---
They were used. If I remember correctly you needed coordination for it because while they couldn’t see you, you also couldn’t see them. So it was useful in certain bg’s where say you had a stealthed rogue on ventrilo that could act as eyes for you. Like for example you are a good bursty dps and a rogue is searching for a flag carrier. Rogue could find him tell you he’s engaging and you could pull off an assassination. 
---
It had its situational uses. Alchemists / engineers in organized PvP groups definitely made good use of their profession. Free action potions where definitely used, swiftness potions where used, invis was used, and if you had that living action potion from ZG exalted recipe you were basically a god.
---
this is correct, I would avoid it
---
Well said.
---
so you decide for everyone now what classic is about? the only joy i get out of wow is when i minmax and play with competitive players like myself.
---
I just came for [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]
---
LOOK WHAT MY WIFE'S BOYFRIEND GOT ME BEFORE THEY WENT ON VACATION SO I CAN GRIND IN PEACE
---
Yeah everyone here is such a racist.
---
I can remember wipes in pretty much every instance. But always just because someone screwed up. You'd come back and clear the instance every time. I never remember getting to a pull of trash or a boss that you just couldn't beat with your current team comp/gear level. For instance the last boss in Shadow Lab or Shattered Halls in TBC heroics. Sometimes you'd get a group that would wipe 4-5 times and then everyone would just kind of give up and quit when it became apparent the current group couldn't do it.
---
It's not just about whether you clear it. If you're in a raid group with dps who actually care and want to maximize their performance beyond what's necessary to just kill the boss, one of the biggest limiting factors is tank threat, which the human racial is going to aid not insignificantly.
---
&gt;hide
---
What is inspect
---
can't be used in combat. Also puts all your potions on 10 minute CD
---
He's allowed to be pure DPS.  Other warriors are allowed to not bring him.  Everyone is free here!
---
Which dispel fear by ticking occasionally opposed to making your target immune to the next fear like fear ward does.
---
As I recall, the big danger that fear presented in raids was the tank losing aggro while getting feared even briefly and then the boss turning and AoEing half of the raid.
---
In that, the predictability of fear ward made it more effective than tremor totem, usually.
---
"he's wrong and pretentious"
---
"how so?"
---
"lol trust me bro"
---
interesting
---
This
---
The "take it easy" crowd largely won't raid.
---
Raiding is a huge time commitment, *especially* in a "take it easy" guild where people are constantly going afk during raids or taking nights off.
---
So someone who had to leave early forfeits a buy in and doesn't get cashed out (?), while someone who joins late would presumably pay the full buy-in but also get cashed out 100%?
---
free action or sprint potion is probably more useful in most situations
---
Exactly, we are just making sure we have a viable dungeon group between my friends. By viable I mean, tank/healer/3 dps too... if we end up with a Feral, Ret and Hunter than so be it.
---
this is exactly why i came here
---
I think we better pump the breaks here.
---
Hunters are so easy to level you can just click any buttons and still kill things quickly. No need to learn rotations.
---
Then just deal with doing less dps
---
The #1 challenge of classic has been and always will be maintaining a consistent 40+ man roster who shows up at the same time every week. Nothing else comes fucking close. I don't care what race you are or what class you play, all I care about as a MT, GM is that you show up to as many scheduled raids as you possibly fucking can, and you have a ton of fun doing so. That is it. If its not fun for you to play an Orc then don't be an orc - be what you want to stick with and play. End of discussion.
---
The only reason to go hardcore at all in classic, unless you are into speedrunning, is to save time. More dedication out of raid means less time spent in raid. I, for one, have fun on progress and don't mind if something takes an hour longer if everyone is in good spirits and laughing it up. Just about finding like-minded folks on your server on your faction who feel the same way.
---
&gt;Going elf just shows you're not looking to play at a high pvp or pve level.
---
Thanks I needed that laugh. Imagine thinking vanilla WoW has hard raids
---
Wow wow wow now your going over Board.        
---
Female dwarfes &gt; female gnomes - yes, but Male gnomes &gt; female dwarfes.           
---
Nothing is worse than female dwarf or Gnome....
---
308 is the cap, for Pserver sit's 310 or 315 depending on how they set it up. But those 3 weapon skill from 305 to 308 doens't boost your damage so much its super important.
---
starting to recognize the names.
---
He’s right about stuns needing to be very reliable or else the whole pull is botched. I don’t think you’d want that Warlock stun for the same reason AoE mages don’t spec into Frostbite.
---
I sleep between 6-8 hours per night. If I go to bed at midnight I get 7 hours of sleep.
---
One boost to my play time is that my GF plays with me, and that my son (9y) is a nerd gamer as well, so we can just place him in front of ps4 with headset and it's like he's not there :D
---
Isn't eye of the beast op here? Easy to pull, doesn't matter if the pet dies
---
I tested it on a private server and the price rate was..average... but it does so low damage that you need to be tanking 10+ mobs for it to be worth it. Then when you’re not tanking that many mobs it’s essentially worthless and can break cc
---
I didn't say vanilla raids were hard. If you want to play with the upper echelon of try hard guilds ir pre mades they expect certain things.
---
The flat fact nobody ever talks about: If the guild you are applying to cares about the min/max to this level of idiocy, it's because they're carrying 10-15 people who can't play for shit, and they're min/maxing everyone else to make up the deficiency.
---
No serious guild who has 40 COMPETENT players with fair gear, will lose to anything in classic. Classic isn't difficult. It doesn't require bleeding edge skill or gear. But when you're trying to do a raid with 30 people worth of your 40 raiders, you tend to need some of your better players to pick up the slack those 10-15 people aren't picking up.
---
How would a Rogue with Core Hound Tooth + Aged Core Leather Gloves compare to a sword Rogue with Dal'Rend's?
---
My gut says a raid geared epic dagger Rogue would beat out pre-raid swords. If that's the case, then it's worth having 1 (or more) dagger Rogue just for the sake of spreading around loot. It will take a long time for every single Rogue to get BiS swords.
---
Everyone can use consumables, saying something is moderately viable as long as nobody else in the raid is using tons of consumables is not a good way to sell something.
---
So someone should play Ret and expect to be that 1 Ret Paladin that gets to raid? The chances are low that you will find a spot in a semi-hardcore raiding guild, even if they decide to bring one for some reason. 
---
There is nothing that a Ret Paladin brings to the table that other more qualified class/spec combinations do. Hell, a Ret speced Holy Paladin would be more effective. 
---
Yes, play what you want to play, but be sure to know your limitations and not have absurd expectations.
---
I hold my breath until respawn
---
fascinating.  so you want to randomly have a grey screen but never want to hear somebody type 'verily' in chat.
---
To be honest druids were absolutely terrible until the late Vanilla. No AP from agility, talents that were interesting and fun but useless (like Omen of Clarity procs of melee attacks but only reduces the mana cost of spells, not cat's or bear's abilities), 31 talent in Balance was Hurricane, 31 talent in Restoration was Innervate, bears had +65%/125% armor (that's level of mail users/mail user with a shield), no ferocious bite = no finishing move for cats because no one would let you use one of 8 debuff slots on your DoT. 
---
But Classic is based on the 1.12 patch, that's a completely different story.
---
Human melee DPS is significantly better than the other choices for PvE IMO. Dwarf priest is highly impactful. Horde side, Troll and Orc definitely have DPS advantages.
---
Just my experience with the guy, sorry you haven't been around him to know what he's actually like.
---
What server race are you going to be? I wanna spec ele and get carried so I can pewpew in PvP. I promise I’ll provide entertaining guild chat. And I don’t even mind waiting until all the core raiders have their gear so I can pick up scraps.
---
I intend to min/max what i enjoy doing, I believe the important thing that people may not completely get is that there is more variety in how you can min max due to the leeway. It's really the core gameplay that matters more, not the min maxxing itself
---
I simply state a fact (world first has been done 15 years ago; speed clears are going to be the benchmark for classic wow high-end raiding), and my opinion. 
---
If you took my opinion as fact, then kudos to me I guess?
---
&gt;One of my favorite potions was that one where you fall asleep and astral project basically so you can basically move around like an eye or kilrog. Super niche uses but was always a cool thing to do.
---
Name ?
---
Can we also remove the “WoW classic is changing my life!” and the “omg who else can’t wait for classic?!” posts?
---
You don't need to use a max rank of Consecration, and you use Seal of Wisdom and Judgement of Wisdom. In 5 mans you easily have enough mana for 5-6 Consecrations which is more than plenty
---
The main things I see a hunter do that make them a huntard are:
---
Wearing weapons that are useless for them, such as weapons with no stats and an on-hit proc.
---
Running out of ammo in the middle of a run
---
Saying they need to repair after a wipe or two.
---
Not dismissing their pet when jumping off a ledge, running their pet too close to mobs and aggroing, not turning off pet taunt, and other miscellaneous pet ignorance.
---
Using multishot and breaking cc, tab targeting and hitting a random mob, you see this a lot in Rend's room in UBRS.
---
Bobby B, does it just take saying your name to summon you?
---
YOU GOT FAT!
---
True, if you have done a raid a million times you want it done fast. But I think picking min-maxed PvE races seems a bit overkill for that
---
Sweet! I'm talking about playing as a warlock vs rogues but that's still great info
---
Don’t listen to this guy. If you want to be taken seriously you need to start theorycrafting exactly the correct angle and cadence to press the frostbolt key over and over again. If you don’t explain in your application you’re technique then no one will ever let you on your guild and they might even call the FBI and kidnap your mom.
---
That should work both ways: when a horde sees you, they don't know if you are full T3 or with shitty greens
---
You can never be overkill for something like that. Saying true than claiming what you said doesnt really mean you agree with what i said.
---
If you don't mind healing in raids, it might be nice to go shadow priest or ret pala/Enh shaman for the res since Druids only get one res every 30 mins.
---
If you're looking for a class that's gonna be dpsing in raids as well, I'd go with mage for the free food/water and ports and less gear competition.
---
all normal potions are 2min CD but I'm like 90% sure in vanilla invis potions are the one special potion that has a 10 min cd. Can someone verify this?
---
Idk bro. Memes are pretty cringe
---
If you are basing your route off of that pserver database then you're going to have a bad time. This is the first random group quest I selected:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?quest=442
---
It says 250 rep, but actually:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=442/assault-on-fenris-isle
---
It only gives 100 rep. If you're lucky you might  reach revered by 60, but you are going to need A LOT of cloth turn ins.
---
I believe it was called the elixir of dream vision
---
Sorry, you are right. If you want to set speedrun records, minmaxing to the extreme including racials is definitely the way to go
---
Yes, the Lesser Invisibility Potion and Invisibility Potion have 10 minute cooldowns, but that does not put "all your potions on 10 minute CD". It puts all your other potions on a 2 minute cooldown.
---
&gt;99 in his username
---
Dude was probably learning to write words when vanilla came out
---
https://youtu.be/00bVvceMMyg
---
This guy has some nice videos about hunter related stuff to learn.
---
Does it? A lot of tests on the beta have been done with sub 40 items and a lot of them turned out to not scale with SP at all.
---
Nice post,  100% agreed. I really liked TBC but daily quests are a pain in the ass. I don't want to do the same shit everyday since it is most effective.
---
4chan is an imageboard. If you wanted to be accurate you would have said SA. In any case reddit is a cesspool worse than these two alternatives.
---
It's just boring karma grab shit that belongs on Facebook.
---
That's true. But they'll probably try and kill me anyway because I'm a Gnome.
---
And I'd probably let them. Because I'm a Gnome.
---
List updated, planning to included phase info next.
---
Eh, I'd say dwarf is up there as well. It's basically the same discussion as dwarf rogue vs gnome rogue.
---
List updated. Thanks for your help!
---
Their response to you: Your*.
---
Way to go, you! Now aim for 10 more until Classic drops!
---
List updated, more stuff added :)
---
Except for frost mage. They are always just Frostbolt, Frostbolt, Frostbolt, Frostbolt, Frostbolt. 
---
Except for the occasional Frost Nova while leveling which doubles their Rotation :P /s
---
Dude you scared me with some truths at the beginning;  
---
1 Groundhog day can not happen, as even if the emotion is the same it has different position and information to previous references; all it can happen is to reinforce the archetype or in other words; blow the collective conscious balloon of WoW thus without touching and seeing another person reinforcing his want to play the game as we people are shiple and like to do stuff other people do.   
---
Example: My friend watched WoW movie and the next day when i woke up not yet speaking with my friend developed a want to play wow via shared consciousness (My friend means i emphatize with his feelings)  
---
2 groundhog day can not happen in short cause we are in a different place in the universe.  
---
bonus: if you use your mental picture and add emotions to this picture, than consciously stop stressing on the outcome, the future result has around 99% chance to happen. Tested this and it works... it's a cheat code.  
---
bonus2: Time flies or goes slow depending on your awareness. If you are asociated it goes normally if you are disasociated and waiting for future events it goes differently... People need meditation to take care of the monkey EGO.
---
Your 100% fbi
---
I'm 18, started playing when I was 10 and have always found difficulty finding people in my age group who play also, so I hope more young people pick it up too. That being said the age issue doesn't bothed me as much anymore.
---
I will be playing it myself for as long as I can but once uni starts it's a different story, miss it being the only thing I cared about in middle school without other worries.
---
So you care that people think you're an idiot, so you're attacking other people? Great logic there, mate.
---
Just need on every piece of gear that ever drops
---
Class isnt something you can "min/max", you just play what you want to play. Race, sure. Going shaman so each of the races have major plus sides, in different situations. So STILL torn between those. Professions, ofc, hardcore raiding guild, so engineering is must have. But the way im going to play, not sure what to pick as 2nd profession/ professions on the numerous alts im going to play, eventually.
---
Min/maxing fully depends what you are trying to accomplish. If you are trying to lets say speedrun MC in phase 1/2, obviously you have to gather all buffs, use flasks etc. If its just fast normal run, no use spending much extra gold on it.
---
I don't think young people are more toxic than old folk. Really depend of the trend. Young people just follow the trend in the game. If the environnement is toxic then they will replicate it and continue to play. Older folks tend to just stop playing in disgust. 
---
And your side note is really true, I played with a lot of younger dudes and most are respectfull if you treat them as equal. On the other hand, some old fucker are smug as fuck and tend to be like "I played it longer so I know better and you are a young shitter who doesnt know his place".
---
List updated, more suff added. Keen to know if there are more 'on use' items to include however so will keep an eye on YouTube :)
---
18 now and started playing in cata, this just about sums up my WoW experience.
---
List updated :)
---
List updated. :)
---
Race does actually make a noticeable difference, even for not super hardcore people. But the thing is, the few percent extra damage you do against raid bosses as a human is certainly not important. This isn't BfA, raids are not hyper competitive, and you don't need to squish out every little bit of extra damage to help your guild down the bosses.
---
Have added more detail to this, thanks.
---
Have added more detail to this.
---
Have you guys seen info, if you can play classic wow on the starter account, if you just add gametime on it ? Going to multibox, so do i need a wow key on those or not ?
---
The more time we get before the #_#@$ing BGs get added the better.
---
Right? Stop using d/wh40k for your WoW fanboy shit
---
While that's true, you have to keep in mind, there's edgemaster handguards and core leather gloves. Any of those items will provide the weapon skill necessary to take you to that magical 305 weapon skill. 
---
While the advantage from 305 weapon skill compared to 300 is massive, in essence you really only sacrifice your hands slot, if you pick a race with no skill bonus. And what is the hands slot lategame? 35 str, 1% hit, 1% crit.
---
Really only 2h users would benefit as massively from the racial bonus, as it says on the tin, as there are no items with 2h weapon skill bonus.
---
Feral druids are largely 'stuck' with two roles regardless. The argument for [0/30/21] (https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxxhscMdxVxsoxo) is that an additional healer at near-max efficiency is worth more than a cat DPS missing some important cat talents. The only important healing talents you're missing are Gift of Nature and Moonglow, and I feel like Moonglow is largely made up for by instead having Heart of the Wild for a much more beefy mana pool.
---
Obviously you can't have a spec that does it all. But this one lets you flex more competently into a healer slot than a traditional [14/32/5] (https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLVhoZxxbsfMdtV) feral tank/cat spec.
---
Pfft. Bears? Why be a bear when you can Crit on a rank 4 fireball for like 176 damage at level 19? Mage master class
---
fbi open up
---
Cant lay traps in combat tho
---
&gt; if the person passes the initial screening interview for the raid team then whore cares what their spec is.
---
Because your entire premise is *backwards.* It's the casual guilds who are going to be the toughest to progress on.
---
I really liked this explanation of how meme specs worked in Vanilla:
---
&gt; “...it's funny when people keep saying that you can join a casual guild that will bring players with unviable specs. Yes, you technically can, and you might even get carried through most/all of MC and Onyxia. But once you get stuck on a boss like Vael for a few weeks the "try-hard" clique of the guild will start pointing out the DPS below the tanks. Which inevitably leads to losing those tryhards or to losing those players with unviable specs (either respecing or not inviting them). Casual guilds will already have a harder time clearing content, why would they purposely make it even harder by bringing dead weight specs?”
---
The only Thing I'm really minmaxing is gonna be leveling.      
---
But that's because I'm not a big Fan of the leveling process. All the other minmaxing will depend in my mood at that time.
---
Swords just slightly better than daggers
---
I would ask the reasoning behind going for a certain race. The case can be made for NE being the superior dagger rogue race. A tank not being human? Yeah I'll pass unless he has the resume to make up for it.
---
&gt;Also after watching this video I kinda think the melee cleave teams are wasting their time. Any group with 2 mages will be ridiculously faster than any group without.
---
What guild is going to have 2x more mages compared to lets say warriors and rogues ? Melee cleave is there BECAUSE you wont have the luxury to run 3 mages per 1 warrior and 1 priest. And why would you even want to. You need 8 different classes with X number of each class. 
---
Because only guilds or group of very good friends are going to be able to setup this kind of grouping for a \~week. So you work what you got.
---
Im going with shaman, hunter, warlock, priest and warrior. Far from optimal melee OR spell cleave. We still dont have to drink almost at all, but we dont have the cleave multiple warriors would give. But what we got is super experienced, hardcore players. So we will make it work.
---
Why thankfully?
---
My expectation is:
---
2-3 months for phase 1 (november 2019)
---
3-5 months for phase 2 (march 2020)
---
2-3 months for phase 3 (june 2020)
---
3-5 months for phase 4 (october 2020)
---
5-8 months for phase 5 (april - may 2021)
---
So, on the lower end we'd be in phase 6 after 15 months (december 2020) and on the upper end it's 24 months (August 2021)
---
I personally thought Fiddlemybits is the best. especially since you had it on a human female.  
---
its suggestive, but not offensive.  
---
Dontouchkids is pretty witty aswell. the only problem is it doesn't have this playful undertone that Kiddyfiddler has.
---
Back when we used to run molten core (40), we had a few regulars from other guilds that would join us. Maybe due to their schedule they couldn't raid with their guild or they were a better player in a not so good guild. We usually gave them stuff from MC that dropped. We had DKP and they were included in that or if it was a one time thing, we'd give them gold from the guild vault or skins or stuff from the core hounds.
---
Yeah I was talking more in the context of the levelling race. For a guild of course, getting the warriors/priests/paladins to 60 fast is a core reason to do dungeon grinding so group makeup will mostly be determined by that.
---
I don't think the phases should be equally spaced out. Phase 1/2 and 4 for example don't offer much content, they should be shorter than the others.
---
You seriously think running MC for 12 months is perfect?
---
Tell that to /r/dota2
---
Nice
---
&gt; So all we can do is hope they add just 1 server of that type.
---
\#nochanges
---
What epic quest gear?
---
Hardcore guilds that know what they are doing won't care. It's the wannabe hardcore meta guilds that don't actually know what they are doing that will care. 
---
Competitive speedrunners will probably care. But that is not relevant until way into the content cycles when people are getting really geared and you could actually get a raid with 20+ well-geared human warriors or whatever.
---
!remindme 36 days
---
Let this be a life lesson for you friend...
---
We carry our druids, so out druids can carry our flags.
---
((also druids have the single highest player skill cap in the game, and CAN be very good, they simply also have the lowest skill floor in the game))
---
During Vanilla I experienced this. A friend‘s guild needed a shaman for their melee group and he asked me if I want to join.
---
I had 0 experience on raiding, but got short instructions what to do (totems and support heal). They were very happy with the job I did, and after getting the !5th! item because of insane loot luck, they asked me if I want to join their guild.
---
That’s how my raiding story started, and I stayed with that guild until the end of TBC and had the greatest time in my gaming life.
---
If you need the other guilds players to actually DO your run, just reserve legendaries and 1-2 other high end drops and other than that just MS+1 rest of the loot.
---
Then how come your  thread isn't banned?
---
Because it shares CD with other potions and there’s better potions you can use in pvp.
---
Boomers making memes is a sight to behold
---
I'm rolling enhance early too and am considering respeccing to Ele at 51 for AV.  Standing 36 yards back with elemental mastery and pewpewing is pretty fun AND good for honor.   Enh is pretty awful for AV until you're pretty geared.  Plus, you get that lvl 60 blue weapon quest reward at 51.  
---
Also, there's about a free level's worth the XP in turning in the opposing faction looted items, but after that I remember the XP sucking.... plus you're "that guy" queuing AV to grind rams/wolves.
---
Yes lets make this more elitist and way more mathy since everybody knows this sub is for the spreadsheet hardcore nerds that need a calculator to go make a dudu.
---
Lol, entire week off wasted on lvl 5 chars.
---
I cant decide either 
---
I’d love a doomkin
---
But hunter and mage look great fun aswell
---
This is hard 
---
I’ll probably decide at release I guess
---
Yes, you dont need to buy the game, just gametime.
---
[This is a pretty good guide to get you started.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1J8y9iJFT_tMU1bsPUNve7F1sNhW33LA-xe1hx0NAa_0/mobilepresent?slide=id.g43508fa7f9_0_0)
---
Graveyards? You mean to outside the dungeon?
---
You need to be in a raid with your alt. Logout, login into your alt &gt; reset instance with it and then login to the main.
---
Hard to say, was in the beta but didnt really test the macro system that much. Because there werent much info about it to test.
---
Classic is hybrid of retail and vanilla. Stuff is taken out of BOTH of the macro systems. Not everything that works in retail/vanilla will work in classic. 
---
What im interested in, that does /castsequence macro work in classic. Would make multiboxing dps rotation shit much simpler.
---
I mentioned those in a general sense. 2 mages don't even need to cc the paladin. The paladin can't do anything outside of bubble. Without resilience, warrior can't survive long enough past 2 counter spells and grenades.
---
This is very true and and probably the point i should have made. 
---
Either way a gnome warrior = good times.
---
As if damage matters at all until you get to AQ40.. you can do everything up until there with only meme specs :D
---
But after that I agree meme specs are not really in the correct place. Except for 1-2 People maybe :p
---
RP and RP-PvP are vastly different and it's been labeled as RP and RP-PvP in vanilla. RP-PvE is labeled as RP only in the server list.
---
Vanilla had RP-PvE labeled RP only.

No one is gonna give a shit when they are 39/40 looking for the last Rouge... 
---
Nahh I'd rather search for another 30mins then take a fricking gnome Rouge... l2p pleb
---
Into the trash you go
---
Your English is pretty good. It took me a second to realize it was was your second language, so good job. Thanks for being a good sport. Also, congrats
---
Between trinkets and gadgets like goblin rocket helm, grenades, sheep spam, novas, etc, two mages are living through a paladin's bubble no problem.
---
Not that mages need to "live through" a bubble. The warrior gets blown up before the bubble even finishes.
---
Yeah sorry, don't know either. I just don't like all the complaining about it.
---
What? That’s literally what I was saying from the get go. Seriously wtf is going are are you fucking with me?
---
You’re missing the point
---
A mage with cds , a warlock with cds, a rogue with cds, they all
---
Destroy shadow 1v1
---
The game is never progressing, after a year people will generally have t2 equivalent or more 
---
Shadow scales the worst, and doesn’t need to be undead as a mage to lose.
---
I was r12 as shadow, having to drink literally after every 1v1 fight for 60 seconds is absolute aids and I won’t be subjecting myself to that
---
It’s the most easily interrupted class in the game and isn’t that good in PvP now that people know how to play.
---
So you mean like retail WoW?
---
I aim but a humble vessel channeling our lord
---
Very nice, thank you.
---
your assuming a) you can fill the raid and b) that you have to. I healed MC on a lev 58 dwarf priest and we had 36 guys in the raid. I was only there cos it would have been 35 without me and who cares lets bring him do you wanna come? 
---
 Your gonna take the moonie simply cos hes willing to come and its better then an empty spot.
---
Very much so.
---
Can confirm. [Poll](https://imgur.com/a/ks2tZVS) from the EU discord.
---
Is +6 from talents.
---
So 2 away from softcap.
---
Prot Warrior with the lightning engineering shield you can’t die and do 2.5 times a equally geared mages blizzard dps no Rez for your twink though
---
&gt;Retri, well, I guess. Might have the hardest time on alliance just because paladin is the best healer, and you only need ~4 of them to cover all buffs.
---
Paladin only needs 20 points in holy and good healing gear to be that famous healing class with infinite mana. This leaves you with 31 talent points, missing 5% healing crit chance from holy tree and without a holy shock which isn't a good spell (1.5s GCD to do the same amount of healing as 1.5s cast of Flash of Light, it costs twice as much mana and has 30s CD).
---
Gluth fears.
---
its gonna be brutal espec with the melee leeway mechanic.
---
I was field marshal I forget what rank that was I didn’t have the ambition to pull off the grand marshal slog. It just wasn’t my experience at all.I wasn’t drinking after every 1v1 fight and as someone who was rank 12 you know there’s a lot more that goes into PvP scenarios outside of hapless duels. 
---
For what it’s worth I also don’t really plan to go priest again because it actually got kind of boring. But this they’re trash via scaling argument just seems bunk.
---
Congratulations to you too,we will be able to enjoy the game as better ourself :-)
---
That sounds fucking terrible (I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume it's not quite so bad, but): if you're going to use a system, the rules need to be clear as there's nothing worse than saving dkp for an item, having it drop, then being told at the last minute that you're not allowed it. Really kills morale.
---
Because the phrasing of the question was intentionally made in a way to cause discord in people’s beliefs, with an attempt to be deep and philosophical at the same time.
---
In other words a bad question.
---
Read above??????????
---
Ferals are low priority in healing gear.
---
This post is cringe TBH
---
That's because communism in practice always becomes totalitarianism with concentration camps. I highly recommend you read The Gulag Archipelago for an insight into what happens when communism is practiced and more importantly why it always turns out that way.
---
It's always been that way
---
Wait how does an alliance warlock have an edge in PvP if skilled?
---
Assuming equal skill, Horde Warlock absolutely have an edge.
---
In random bgs I honestly don’t care for a win or loss. It’s probably because it doesn’t really matter for me given that it’s child’s play in comparison to high rated premades. I do stupid shit like consistently jumping off of LM to throw grenades in people to get a jump on them for the memes. If I lose whatever, if we win, cool. Don’t feel so pressured to alwyas win in an environment that is intended for fun.
---
If you really care enough bout it, I’d find a group of people to Pvp with that have the same attitude as you, then you won’t have to spend time that is supported to be fun, with standing on a flag afk and falling asleep. Leave that boring stuff to the times it matters.
---
&gt;Distracting shot (highly underrated ability for the hunter to save healers, other dps, or even the tank with a 40 yard range taunt)
---
I used to use my pet to off tank with as well, have it grab the add growl at it then use my /petassist focus target macro to drag the add back to the tank. (normally my tank is my focus target cos that lets me /assistfocus to target switch to what hes killing after I cc'd something).
---
 Gotta know your tank though: some tanks will get SERIOUSLY pissed off with you and start ranting about "turn off growl @!\*#\~!" If a tank knows you though and knows your gonna babysit the healer, its all good.
---
It'll be the complete opposite, even PUGs will require you to min/max.
---
Majority of the players will be spamming BDR/Scholo/U. Strat  to become raid ready as soon as possible.  Some like to think that min/maxing never existed in Vanilla WoW, but in reality the majority of the raiders who got to BWL/AQ40/Naxx considered hardcore and min/maxing was necessary, even more for semi-hardcore guilds where some of the players needed to heavily min/max and use consumes to outweigh the non min/maxers in their raid. 
---
Now we have access to all the data for min/maxing, meaning even PUGs will require you to min/max to even consider inviting you, and also except uploading screenshots of your UI to make sure you have raid addons.
---
&gt; The logical conclusion to this line of reasoning is Classic BFA, which is the complete opposite to the point of any of this.
---
You reiterate this ponit several times and I really can't agree. Wow sub numbers started to drop in cata and tank in WoD. Nobody is clamoring for wanting to go back cata, mop or Wod; many people want vanilla, tbc or wrath. What possible reason could there be to make classic wod or later? If the classic saga continues, it'll likely end with wrath.
---
&gt; Arenas in TBC were my favorite thing ever, though. Me too, so let's make sure they put it into a Classic Plus expansion.
---
That's where you would lose me, I hate arenas. Arenas were my least liked feature in tbc as they changed pvp from the factions comepting over objectives to just trying to kill the other 2/3/5 people. If bgs and arenas could exist side by side, it'd be fine, but when I palyed, you only got entry level pvp gear from bgs and the good stuff from arenas.
---
&gt; 1) The world keeps getting smaller
---
Agree, but it's a bit hyperbole. In tbc you had 3 high level zones you regularly visited. In vanilla it was 5-6. 
---
&gt; 2) Player interaction has been minimized.
---
Again hyperbole. This really wasn't verym uch the case in tbc. The levelling ease only started to creep in in wotlk. TBC levelling was very similar to vanilla.
---
&gt; 3) All the classes are far more similar to each other than they've ever been
---
Complete disagree. The homogenization began with cata mostly. In tbc the classes were in a much better state than in vanilla, most importantly, the hybrids were no longer relegated to healing, as all of them could offer something unique. Wrath was similar.
---
&gt; 4) The game feels repetitive.
---
Agree, but daily quests weren't such a major part of tbc.
---
In all this, you miss the biggest problem with classic plus though: How are you going to make it work? A massive problem simply lies in the fact of how good naxx gear is. DPS shot into the stratosphere for many classes. How are you continueing to build on this? TBC gave blizz the chance to do a gear rebalancing, which brought damage into line again. You'd somehow have to do this in classic plus as well.
---
You don't want to put Fear Ward on casters. You want to put Fear Ward on the god damn tank.
---
Yup, they already do.
---
Long trips work exactly like loot but for people who like to explore the world instead of killing things. You'll explore the world, unlock taxi routes, learn shortcuts and then you'll never have to do that again. Just like you'll fight bosses, craft items and buy those on AH just to complete your set of BiS items and never care about loot drops. It's not the end point that is interesting but the sense of progression and feeling of accomplishment (as in making something complete) that makes it engaging for some people.
---
If you casual and dont plan on raid do any class you like.
---
If you plan on doing 2x weekly raids make some class that has at least decent dps/utility and allways come on time, be friendly and take consumables you need.
---
Id rather take random warr with no consumables, than meme build that dont take raids somewhat seriosly. You are not wasting just your time, but other 39 ppl as well.
---
Source?
---
You won't be doing any kind of substantial DPS as a HoTW druid. It basically takes no cat talents at all.
---
With 3 mages, you can probably have a mage stand at the front of the pull and frost nova it to prevent guys from getting out of the blizzards as easily. 
---
Or alternately, for the first couple mobs, your pulling druid can draw aggro only on those 2-3 lead mobs, and then pull them backwards into the main body of the pull, so as to concentrate the pull more.  Just don't do the frost nova and the druid pullback at the same time, obviously. 
---
I really think it will work, simply because kargoz was sucessfully aoe grinding in ragefire chasm. I don't recall his exact group comp (I think it might have been 3 mages, a lock, and a priest), but if you can do it at like 17, you can probably still do it at 22.
---
You can just type the question into google instead of reddit and click on the first link.
---
2007Scapes sub is God tier, can we just copy them..
---
Funny thing the latest update was actually during an interview by Omar and John where they said it was being considered.
---
After that nothing.
---
Bring stuff over? If anything it's modern players continuing the trend
---
Well twitch app is the rebranded curse after Amazon brought twtich then curse, so technically yes?
---
i stupidly made the mistake of abandoning the quest and it dropped the item. I almost leveled a new char just to get it :D
---
Must be a shit mage if you're using only frostbolt while levelling.
---
I highly doubt it
---
Legit entertaining.
---
The game starts at level 60, so it wouldbe 25% for  leveling, and 75% for the end game, not the other way around.   
---
I mean, most people will have more playtime in lvl 60 than the 1-59.
---
People are also not stupid; alot of guides are telling people to slow down, and i think they will litsen to that.
---
So offer to be the dagger rogue instead. Humans will be happier to have their swords, and the playing field will be equal with daggers regardless.
---
There is also wowace.com and wowinterface.com :D
---
There is nothing to make me think that blizzard (/activision) wouldn't butcher Classic+ if they went that way. I say BC is a safer option.
---
This thread should be deleted
---
Druid was my alt. My main was a Warrior. The Druid was a breeze to level. I played through ZG and some MC on my druid as a healer and then as feral. Really liked feral, its useful to off-tank AND also be able to DPS decently(not as good as a rogue or Warriors)
---
I try to maximize min/maxing instead
---
I’m not much of an RPer and I’m not much of a PVPer but when I think of RP servers, I always assume RPPVP because they seem such natural bedfellows. 
---
I hope the RPPVP community get what they want. It would be a real shame not to give them at least one realm per region.
---
It‘s Classic bruh
---
Can't use in combat and it puts your other pot on CD
---
Probably on a 3-6 month schedule, so that it can be timed with content releases from competitor games, when they don't have new content ready for retail WoW.
---
This is the result of Sodapoppin having a child with Asmongold.

It always matters if your pet dies!
---
haha awesome, ye that video was really popular in russia 10 yrs ago :p
---
Amazon bought curse??
---
my wife and her boyfriend finally left the place meaning I can on her nintendo switch and finally play ocarina of time!!!
---
the quest for the bow
---
Master of only 3 schools :)
---
No, Twitch bought Curse.
---
Oh really? Ok ty
---
Dude why is everyone in this reddit so salty? xD Did you see the /s behind my post? This means /sarcasm so People don't take it serious but some People always get offended xD
---
Yes I'm a pretty terrible mage only using frostbolt while leveling. Only for style purposes though :3
---
Thats why I Play druid - so I only have to cast moonfire all day - it is instant and way superior to frostbolt **/s**
---
They on the roof.  They are always on the roof.
---
You're gonna heal at 60 just saying.
---
Honestly no and here is the simple reason why, polymorph is much easier to use than freezing trap. Polymorph is much easier to fresh than freezing trap.
---
Ah I see, I guess I'm not very familiar with the inner workings of a spelladin.
---
At one point in time or another I believe I saw some experimenting with [Manual Crowd Pummeler](https://classicdb.ch/?item=9449) as well.
---
relax a little there, buddy
---
We're you referring to the Spirit of Aquamentas? I couldn't find any mage specific lvl 50 quest that rewarded an off hand.
---
Millenium - Archimonde [FR]
---
Amazon-owned Twitch brought Curse. I mean technically yes Twitch is the owner, but daddy Amazon's money bought Curse.
---
Keybind pet attack and pet passive. 
---
Don't use multishot in stupid situations. That's it
---
You could make it ongoing raids. Rather than a new expansion he keeps invading and retreating. Keeping the original world in tact, but also keeps fresh raids occurring.
---
Well no the mobs will die so fast. and they will be rooted so the tank can just run away and healed. it worked really well on beta. The game is really easy so you don't really need a healer.
---
I mean, I follow guides I want to follow, and ignore those I don't. I ignore leveling guides, for instance, because I like figuring that out. Prof guides, though? Yes please.
---
You're treating the average reader as if they're a 5-year old child who needs protection from being influenced by other humans.
---
Yikes.
---
That just sounds like semantics. If one player can cc effectively and the other can't it doesn't really matter if they have the same skill level. You won't be able to tell the hunter is equally skilled because they will perform so much worse.
---
I'm sure it will be balanced. But people will still complain here regardless. Based on many opinions in this thread, people are hoping it takes 5-6 months before the second phase comes out. While I agree that catering to the pserver community for release schedules would be a bad idea. Many people seem to think the "I have a job and family and can only play 4 hours a week" group are the norm hence the 6 months before phase 2 which would also be a mistake imo.
---
That’s not even a question though.
---
Walk with the earthmother.
---
I am making both warlock and rogue.
---
Undecided on main. 
---
First i will level lock for free mount and easier farming, alsi gather rested xp on rogue and play on him every once when i get bored, or ganked.
---
ofc it is. stop playing dumb. vanilla wow was made for casuals even blizzard said so. That's a great thing. the hardcore players can have retail and the casuals will have vanilla. like the rotation for frostmage is frostbolt only. This is superchill just like its supposed to be. having to do a rotation is so annoying anyways.
---
Glad you liked it 😊
---
This would be so OP in combat. Furry warris und warlocks could use it to delete thread and go ham like they always wanted to do

In this case, half the kindergarten is populated by college students, and offers **voluntary** quantum mechanic classes, which Billy is free to opt out if he finds them boring or confusing.

[Martin Thunder](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Martin_Thunder) was another GM item that killed anyone in a 30 yard radius. Don't know anything about an incident related to it though.
---
&gt; You will have no issues finding a guild so long as you show up on time and listen to the raid leader.
---
Raid leader: We need you to heal as we have many decent DPS waiting on the sidelines but not enough healers.
---
I agree but don’t call me Judy
---
Definitely! I love Alchemy, so many different ways to make gold and it's both passive and active goldmaking 😊
---
Dear god, I just realized, this game is old and the memes are so bad... It's goddamn boomer memes!
---
I... yeah.
---
How come the only people to reply seem to miss the point of the entire post? It's the first 2 lines of the post, followed by simple examples I have personally witnessed.
---
No, Twitch has its own finances, its own board, its own executives. Bezos was very clear the acquisition was "hands off".
---
Please elaborate, you're making no sense my guy.
---
DAE REMEMBER GRIZZLY HILLS?
---
Right, that and also mages give you food and water.
---
This is literally, in the classical sense of the term, the entire point of this post.
---
But orange juice can taste different...!
---
Just fine I imagine. I'm not saying anyone has to min max if they don't want to. There are guilds for every mind set and play style.
---
I feel attacked. 
---
My first playthrough of the Witcher 3 was hell. Then I found out your potion supply gets filled when you meditate. Love that shit.

---
Thank you for this quality content
---
They reversed the bans almost immediately, and haven't banned anyone since.
---
Then all we end up is stuff that is easily and quickly upvoted. Mostly pictures. It drowns out discussion.
---
Nobody minds those old pictures in general. It’s just hat we have seen so many, it is getting to r/classicwowcirclejerk levels.
---
Me too, we should fuck
---
To be fair the reason people call them Huntards is because one only needs to roll his face on the keyboard to be an effective hunter. hmph... much like Hearthstone
---
Isn't this the whole reason why there are so many perceived huntards?  
---
The class offers just a lot more abilities to fuck up than say a holy paladin who's role is very straight forward: put blessings every 15mins, spam heals, apply cleanse when needed. There mission accomplished.
---
Hunter on the other hand:
---
Pet not dismissed? It pathes through half the dungeon pulling everything along the way.
---
Pressed multishot at pull out of habit? Freezing trap, polymorph and shackle are broken and the mobs run rampant.
---
Not used to FD + trap? The hunter can't reliably CC.
---
Serpent sting on the mob that is supposed to be resheeped? No resheep for that mob.
---
Paladin is necessary for me to play cause I can heal myself. No one ever wants to play with me so it’s perfect for solo
---
A hunter while leveling always has his pet as safety net. He never has to learn almost anything and can still do ok.
---
A hunter in a dungeon suddenly needs to control that dangerous beast or it will wreak havoc. And he has a powerful tool set that may have no idea how to use.
---
What?! So you'd also rather take a bad huntard over a good mage?
---
Also being a good mage is something completely different. It is literally "turn up with at least 10 stacks of water" press frostbolt for the rest of the raid. Except for some parts where a sheep may be needed but let's be honest - one of the other 7 mages is going to do that :P
---
I’m gonna level my Troll Rogue and there’s nothing you can do about it
---
There was a Youtube video a few days ago, that talks about that (I can't find it). It won't work with the old macro, but the video shows a work-around. It's not as convenient as the macro, but at least something.
---
If you're in a casual enough guild that no one cares about taking meme DPS specs, I'd rather take a loyal/eager boomkin over a mage or warlock who can't hit their buttons properly and has an ego the size of Ragnaros simply because of the class he plays.
---
That's encouraging, would be sweet to play as undead on my screen but with that sweet sweet hardiness
---
No. A bad mage is likely to perform just as well as a good hunter.
---
So - I don't make differences. 
---
There are good huntards - there are bad huntards. But they will always be huntards.
---
Mage's will give me water. They are always good :)
---
👨‍🌾
---
It's a minor annoyance compared to what a PvP realm brings in community, depth, and fun
---
It means you already picked your class. Enjoy.
---
Haha :D True :P *Good huntard
---
Longer. You are talking about a set bonus that had to be nerfed in TBC because it was still being used.
---
I'll play a troll warrior engineer main tank. It just happens that the min/maxing of tanks is really fun to me.
---
Sapper charges are awesome, as are nades of all kinds for pulling, Trolls look awesome and Berserking is fun as hell to use on top of that. Apparently the troll regen also generates a tiny bit of threat but I only heard that in the warrior discord, might be wrong.
---
Sometimes minmaxing is just a fun way to play. If that happens to be the case I'll gladly do it!
---
If it's way less fun to do for me... Eh, I'll pass if there's an alternative.
---
Rogues seems like fun!
---
Really nice to read indeed. I fieel like it's the best way to do it. Flexible and depending of the average player time.
---
Alright thanks guys, I'm from now on an Undead Rogue, one day you will see me on the top of some sort of leaderboards BELIEVE IT!
---
I'd say Gnomes are better just because mages are so easy to kill if you know what you're doing.
---
Hah, "ok". I'll let you live in that bubble.
---
Better deliver on that promise. For the Horde !!
---
You enter BRD, and clear as little mobs as necessary in the first room towards the arena. Optionally, you can wait in front of the arena entrance for the elemental boss to patrol by, he drops BIS healing/casting shoulders. Then you enter the arena, kill the usual two event bosses and then summon the T0.5 boss. Rinse and repeat, takes only a few minutes per run.
---
Warlock: do you wanna be a spell caster?
---
Rogue: do you wanna be a melee class?
---
Shadowpriest: do you wanna have a hard time joining a raiding guild, or a dungeon?
---
They'll constantly bitch about stream sniping, except a fair amount of posts on  getting banned for ganking streamers.
---
Ne girl for dem faps
---
lol no
---
I'm playing either mage or warrior. Not worried about the population of either. I know I will play better than most players anyway. I'm confident in my ability to get into a decent guilds raid team, so it doesn't matter. If I want to tank it might be a bit problematic as a warrior, but it still almost entirely comes down to my dedication to it, a few percentage of more competition isn't changing things much. 
---
I'm also way more worried about how many players of my class a typical guild will bring. There is going to be a lot of competition for loot as both a warrior and a mage.
---
Sounds like an ideal solution, any idea if it worked on the classic beta? Thanks!
---
Lmao Rogue it is
---
I remember seeing something like that as well, forgot to save it haha
---
&gt; But Classic is based on the 1.12 patch, that's a completely different story.
---
Fortunately, 1.12 has been what every serious private server has used, so its been heavily mathed and played out and we've come to the conclusion that Druids can tank any fight in the game if your guild/raid has confidence in you and you're actually a good tank.
---
Obviously warriors are just superior in some fights, but for MC and BWL, you got nothing to worry about except a Nef class call, should probably just let the warrior MT that one until you're decked out in Naxx/AQ40 gear and have enough armor to just tank it out in cat (and yes, that can be done).
---
Yes MCP is the top weapon for spelladin, at least on pservers. Ironfoe is more in the discussion as a weapon, when you don't use mcp (i.e. if a fight lasts longer than 90sec or on trash).
---
We'll see how it works out. The big problem with spelladin is, that it's basically all theoretical tests. The only practical application we have are a few raid bosses by Mourtagh on a pserver, where he managed to do around 1200 dps on Patchwerk in top end gear and all buffs (though for spelladin top end gear is pretty much already reached in p5, there is almost nothing worthwhile in naxx, even aq40 doesn't offer a whole lot).
---
Beta didn't tell us a lot either, as Spelladin doesn't work on lvl 40. We only have more theoretical tests on coefficients, not how it plays out in a raid enviroment and how much dmg it will be able to do.
---
Your second version is solid, though personally I'd drop improved mana burn and take Healing Focus if you plan on occasionally taking on the role of a healer where needed (such as in random AB/WSG games when your team is 100% DPS).
---
I used to always take I:MB but is a 17% reduction in casting time that big of a deal? It means you can fully oom a caster in 25 seconds rather than 30 seconds which is great but the less remaining mana they have to start with, the less valuable it is. Even if you're in a mana burning war with an equally geared priest who has I:MB - after 17.5seconds you will have 0mana and they will have 100-200 mana depending on starting pool.
---
If you know basic programming you can probably make it yourself. All you need to do is read the inventory and save the data, then you can read the file in the addon folder.

It isn't that hunters are inherently worse players, but it is true that hunters screw up more.
---
It simply comes down to hunters having way more things that can potentially fuck up. Your examples of a mage only happen if the player is mentally retarded or a 5 year old kid. Hunters make mistakes even when neither of those.
---
* Forgetting to turn off growl after you farmed last time - can happen to everyone.
---
* Forgetting to buy more arrows before raid - can happen to everyone.
---
* Forgetting to dismiss pet before jumping platforms or going past certain mobs, thus pulling mobs.
---
* Simply having the pet AI go completely retard mode - out of your hands.
---
* Fuck up traps - it isn't targeted like poly.
---
* Fuck up kiting - requires some skill and knowledge of the fight (many people enter raids with neither and do fine on other classes).
---
Just to name a few. No other class have so many ways to screw up. They range from simply annoying and wasting time (forgetting to buy arrows) to pulling the whole goddamn dungeon (jumping platform and having the pet run through all mobs to get to you). Even if you only do the small things, it adds to the reputation. Many of them are also things you wouldn't really know the first time. Who would know a pet can't follow you down a small jump if you never tried it? On the other hand, you don't exactly have to try blinking into mobs to understand that they will probably attack you.
---
Thanks! by the way, this doesn't quite count as a quest reward, but a quest in Searing Gorge provides a quest item called the [Torch of Retribution](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10515/torch-of-retribution), which could be used to level up your unarmed weapon and defence skills by AFK-attacking some small critter as it does zero damage.

Well, one plus is that the Classic community will be a little more mature and patient. So overall, I assume that it won't be too ridiculous.

you are not keeping customers around when they go up against a brick wall the moment they leave a capitol. Same way around there is no entertainment for you when you roll over everything that is not also a AQ/naxx raider

In P1 just the regular occasional ganking/skirmishing out in the world, nothing major. 
---
In P2 all hell will break loose and there will be gank squads running around everywhere, and probably some sort of southshore-esque honor grind.
---
It could be an opportunity not to make the same mistakes. It could become a more hardcore version of WoW.
---
This is the same argument as getting a raid slot as a meme spec; you can do it easily as long as every class that can do it better isn't online at that moment or you're friends with the GM.

I may be able to join premades as shadow since I'll be in a pvp guild ran by good friends but I'm not banking on it as I'd prefer the team to have a better w/l ratio over me saving gold on respecs.

up to 1.10 Freezing was bugged and didn't DR with anything other than itself
---
This was fixed in 1.10,  from 1.10 to 1.12 there was DR on those spells
---
in 2.0 the max duration of ALL pvp crowd control was set to 12 seconds - that was when hunters were allowed to combat trap and the shared DR was removed
---
later the duration for PvP CC was nerfed even further down to 8 seconds
---
After 1.10 you never got the chance to scatter trap someone for more than 12-13 seconds (13 with clever traps pre 2.0)

Oh thx
---
the point is with (almost) all physical abilities that they also start the respective weapon swingtimer
---
The reason why you use a macro like
---
\#showtooltip
---
/cast Arcane Shot
---
/cast !Auto Shot
---
is to ensure that there won't be any delay due to server to client communication before that the very first auto shot starts
---
Or to go into a simplified technical explanation
---
Here is how the communication works when you use an ability without a ! macro
---
user: I want to cast an Arcane Shot
---
server: ok you meet the criteria. You are casting an Arcane Shot
---
also server: hey user. You are not using Auto Shot at the moment. The use of Arcane Shot means you should start to use Auto Shot
---
user: got it.
---
user:  I want to cast an Auto Shot
---
server: ok you meet the criteria. You are starting to cast an Auto Shot
---
With the ! macro on instant cast abilities without an animation/cast time (like Aimed Shot and Multi shot - the later has a 0,5 sec animation time) that you want to start both at once
---
The result is
---
user: I want to cast an Arcane Shot; and I want to start my Auto Shot swingtimer if it isn't already on
---
server: ok you meet the criteria. You are casting an Arcane Shot. You are starting to cast an Auto Shot
---
you get the idea it saves you the communication time which results in you losing a couple of milliseconds every time your swingtimer has to be started again.
---
&gt;No need to learn rotations.
---
Yeah, unlike mages and warlocks that practiced their impressive one button rotation throughout the hardship that is leveling.
---
Come one, this has nothing to do with it. There is no such thing as having to practice rotation in classic, you literally just look it up if you can't figure it out yourself and then just do it.
---
Often the people complaining about flying mounts just want the convenient bottleneck of flight paths as ganking spots. I don't have much sympathy for that. Plus flight gave us huge, three dimensional maps. Blades Edge Mountains and Netherstorm were awesome.
---
My wife is just as excited for Classic as i am. Guess we have to order pizza.
---
It really depends on the class and your goals. Generally though, T2 is around as good if not better than HWL/ GM gear for most classes. T1 can be good for most classes over alternatives, but won't do it all. In general, there will probably be better mix matched pieces of gear that will give you more hp and damage, but most tier sets will give you a decent balance. At least until T3, which is generally better across the board for most classes than alternatives. Also remember that hybrid specs aren't as good with some tier sets. For instance, T2 druid isn't good for feral and the set bonuses are pretty useless in PvP for anything other than healing. Classic WoW PvP gearing isn't super complicated. When you decide what to play, look at the tier and see what the bonuses do, then compare the stats to anything else available in the current phase and plan out how you want to gear for PvP. Just pick gear that has the most stats and if you're playing dps, you won't need nearly as much hit rating in PvP as you do in PvE.
---
Uh, no. SM definitely scales. It's total damage, not base damage.

It’s not even remotely the same thing. Shadow struggled with its mana efficency and overall throughput in pve. It had actual gameplay issues innpve It has no such issues whatsoever in PvP. Saying it does is basically flat out revisionist history. By your argument then people should basically just run teams of mages, warrior/rogue, and priests (paladins too on alliance). 
---
But this just simply isn’t how the game unfolds. I’ve never in all my days had people ask me to respec heals or been denied a group invitation. I also never had anyone even remotely indicate that shadow was bad back in those days.
---
think the guy was just joking around but yeah
---
How come so few people are killing KT on populated pservers?
---
Sweet, thanks for sharing! Did you have enough even at 40? And do you remember if you had to do any additional things such as cloth delivery?
---
“I’m assistant raid leader” “...assistant To the raid leader”
---
 Dont go 1080p please go for minimum 2560x1440
---
You would get a better response from a subreddit like /r/buildapc  or  /r/pcmasterrace .
---
Acer Predator xb241h Is the best in the business for £300. You can overclock it to 180hz.
---
144 Hz is completely unnecessary for Wow. With your budget you can get a decent 27“ Monitor with 1440p Resolution easily.
---
Oh boi, can you elaborate please, I'd love to know more about the guy since he's completely over saturating all podcasts and is being touted as tank jesus. PM if you have to &lt;3
---
Stretch your budget just a little and you can pick up a used Acer Predator XB271HU on eBay, somewhere between 300 and 400. Just find one from a trusted seller who's not used it much, exactly what I did and it's been a dream ever since. 1440p @ 165hz.
---
Here we have another moron saying that the PvE is "extremely easy". Clearly, this person does not know what "extremely easy" even means. I'm sure Naxx and AQ will be extremely easy...and that every guild will clear them in under 30 min or whatever riddiculous number people are spewing out these days. Go and attempt the Four Horsemen mate, and then tell me how "extremely easy" that encounter is.
---
Too many here are pserver veterans who seem to have no idea just how wrong the pservers were in just about everything.  They also don't seem to grasp that not every person who will play wow classic has spent the last 5-6 years jerking off on a private server. Most will not have played wow at all since  Wotlk.
---
Just check out the % of upvotes ... it's only at 54 % so it is rather unpopular. I've had similar discussion in other threads a couple of times and got downvoted rather consistently.
---
**Post the kind of content you want to see.**
---
Because WoW is pretty mongo a lot of the time and it's a gimmick item. There are some situations where it's useful to skip stuff in dungeons and that's about it. People usually don't bother wasting money on consumables for world PvP, and if they do, there are better potions.
---
Going to raid with a night elf shadow priest with no healing gear.
---
I'd suggest a 2560x1440 at 120~ Hz, I promise you the extra bucks is worth it and you won't have to chance your monitor for a few extra years so it's a decent investment.
---
I'm not really angry, just a dramatic :)
---
If by minimize you mean ignore 90% of the elitist crap. Then yes. I plan on having fun. :)
---
Ahh the daily first "everyone should play the way I think is the most fun" post. 
---
Just let everyone be. Let them figure out their way to Play the game? If they decide they want to use guides - let them do it. Why do you have to intervene in their decision making?
---
Arguing that 75% of the game is leveling is also just your opinion. Some people may say it is less than 20% for them. Simply because they will only take 3 month to reach 60 - but then have 2 years left of being 60.
---
I totally understand where you are coming from - I get your Point you don't want to tell People how to Play, you just want the new People to know that not everyone is min/maxing and rushing 60.
---
Unfortunately These Posts always deliver it in a different way than you would want it to.
---
Sadly most new Players will not see this post either. 
---
Luckily there is plenty of good Content too - telling People how nice the journey is and how to paste yourself and enjoy it. 
---
People not lurking on reddit will be avoiding most min/maxing content I hope
---
It was nerfed almost 5 times :) 
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Wintersaber_Trainers
---
No crus aura in Vanilla too.
---
This is amazing.
---
Dont listen to the people advocating 60hz, its a trash refresh rate and once you had 144hz you never go back.
---
rank 14 gear is far better for pvp than tier 2, at best you mix. tier 2 is closer to pvp blue in terms of itemization and power level, not the epic set. Pvp epic weapons are in another league but aren't replaced until late aq40 or naxx.
---
rogue and hunter can maybe get away with it
---
other than that healers and meme specced warriors have gear for their spec, else you go with pvp gear or at best mix pieces.
---
mage tier 2 is one of the worst sets in the game aside from maybe helm, legs, gloves or wrist i forget which, and maybe boots if it has 1 hit or crit but I would have to check.
---
Their wives are bloody casuals then. My girlfriend cleared Naxx as the MT. I didn't kill Ragnaros until fairly late into vanilla and only started dabbling in BWL.
---
MSI Optix line is considered amazing for price/value. 144hz/1ms/VA/FreeSync. Ignore the "you don't need 144 Hz for WoW" comments, the difference is more than noticable.
---
I understand, what you are saying. I was however talking about life improvement feature, where you basically automatically switch to "auto shoot" from "auto attack" (which is melee), whenever you are in appropriate range. As far as I know, this was implemented in TBC and made Hunters somehow smoother
---
This supposedly worked though vanilla, but was patched in 1.12, to remove the buff if you have your pet resurrected by any means. FYI, if it works, you could ask a healer to ress your succi, no need for engi.
---
But what good will any cakes in two weels be doing them for release? Release is what matters, that's the time to buckle up
---
&gt;If you're not already in a raid group that's just waiting for Classic to launch and plans to be 60 within the first two weeks    
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;gonna be interesting to see that happening considering youd be playing 24/7 for 2 weeks to achieve that ... better get out the diapers
---
Yeah, they're cleared "quite fast" by a tiny amount of guilds, usually the ones filled with the kind of people who are willing to grind r14 for PvE purposes.
---
The vast majority of raiding guilds on pservers never even get through AQ40.
---
Of course full feral (11/32/7 or something it was IIRC) is the optimal tank spec, but I wasn't talking about a specifalised spec. Minkelz was saying Tank+DPS spec is better than Tank+Heal spec, and I'm saying it's not.
---
I did that on my Rogue, it even changed the rotation depending upon gear..... Ah those were the days. Those terrible, terrible days.
---
Do you remember whether the cloth hand-ins cap out after a certain point? I have a vague memory that they stop giving rep once you hit revered, but I can't find anywhere online to confirm.
---
Can confirm, once you taste 144 Hz you refuse to go back, regardless of the game.
---
I think you might be underestimating classic raids, I am in a pretty hardcore guild that has been practicing the raids in bad gear on a guild only private server, we aren't imposing race restrictions or anything but people thinking they are gonna be clearing MC and BWL like its nothing in green/blue gear are in for a surprise. We don't wipe a ton or anything but we still do have wipes and thats with people dedicated enough to practice raids 6 months before classic comes out, for average players its going to be an uphill battle until they outgear the content.
---
Don't look solely at DPS. As utility is also a pretty big deal in Classic. The ability to fear mobs for example or sheep them is not to be underestimated.
---
It's funny how things that were a requirement in earlier expansions seem ridiculous in the current iteration of the game.
---
For paladin:
---
T1 is a good entry level healer set for pvp. you want to wear palte in pvp for the armor and T1 gives you that.
---
T2 is good all around, but mostly shines for holy reckoning or holy shock builds. It has significant weaknesses for deep ret builds, as it lacks crit. It's also good at healing.
---
T2.5 is the ultimate set for any offensive pvp paladin, it beats out the pvp set.
---
T3 is the ultimate healer set for PVP.
---
Yes. I never see min-maxers shitting on anyone, but I constantly see people shitting on min-maxers.
---
They're jealous. I won't be in a hardcore guild, but if you played vanilla and now have a job, a wife and possibly children, and you're playing hardcore, go you.
---
I have this one, and it's a beast ! It cost around 600€ when I bough bty. I don't think you could found better for 1440p @165hz with gsync back in the days.
---
Yes, you can download classic now from blizzard launcher, when you change your region on [battle.net](https://battle.net) it will be changed when you log into classic. You could have two accounts this way, one for each region.
---
min/maxing adds a ton of flavour to vanilla.
---
What happens in 2 weeks?
---
Yes please keep this sub quality
---
Looks like you and me had very different experiences. For me TBC was the most wpvp I ever did first of all the levelling experience was awesome whit objectives to hold in almost every zone giving your faction a buff if you held it. Later in the expansion you I did alot of jumping ppl from the air when they where mining/herbing in nagrand and the pvp outside of karazan was almost as good as black rock mountain. The story lines you could follow aswell while leveling was great, I loved being a part in the history of the world in caverns of time. Most of the end game bosses where characters I hade wondered about sins the end of wc3 or the books released. Tbc is also the first time I managed to level several alts to max level (mostly because me an my friends stayed on the same server for one but still)
---
Possibly elemental but you're basically a gimped mage with towns
---
I find it ironic that a post made to complain about minmaxing (which I, as a veteran, also don't understand on classic) became a minmaxers post
---
How does this one look?

---
No deliveries, just questing. Don't forget dungeon quests like BFD, which are also tied to Darnassus reputation.
---
End of AQ40 and Naxx is probably harder than most of retail’s pve though
---
**US region, PvE or RP. Alliance, PST or EST or Other.**
---
I guess you could call me a returning player. I played vanilla for a short time then a IRL issue come and I quit for a while. I came back after TBC came out and played very casually until just after Cata. Again RL intervened, plus I was bored with it anyway and I dropped out for quite a long time. I completely missed MoP, WoD, and pretty much all of Legion. In fact I didn't come back to WoW until about February of 2018.  I played for a few months then RL intervened AGAIN and I dropped out until now. Hopefully things are more settled now but I'd rather have the info out  in the open so any guild leaders can make their own decisions. 
---
Back when I played seriously I was definitely not a hard core raider. I mostly goofed off, sometimes I'd quest, sometimes I'd run dungeons, sometimes I'd farm stuff, which why I have such a crappy achievement score. I mained a Druid. I found that I really liked healing as Restro, and really disliked tanking as Feral. I have not decided between a Priest or another Druid.
---
 
---
This time I really want to raid the higher end stuff with being carried or vastly out lvling the content. 
---
The only major special requirement is I am deaf so sometimes Discord (I almost typed Vent) is tricky. I'm completely uninterested in PvP, mostly because I completely, utterly, totally, and absolutely suck at it.  
---
I've got a pretty open schedule and I'm pretty flexible about things.
---
there are tons of old comments about this on classic.wowhead, it would seem that unless nerfed specifically in late vanilla then it will scale with spellpower as expected.

I would love to, that's my definition of WoW!
---
That's what moms are for. To change the pan.
---
I played until the end of TBC. Got back for Classic and played retail for a few days now. 
---
The complete game is a cringe in my opinion.
---
It entirely comes down to what your raid needs. Maybe the druid getting innervate is best, in which case yes, they should use it on themselves. But in a lot of other cases it's better used on other classes, and then you obviously use it on them.
---
If they don’t have a healer facing a warrior is a lot more doable in my experience.
---
As a new player I'd just like to wish you a good day. We are here, we're just pretty shy at times.

I used them on my warlock to get to the chess event in Karazhan solo. They're not as useful as you think since you can not use them while in combat.

Sure a meme on occasion is good but making a joke about every relevant meme even though they die out in like a week is just a bit off putting about a game that should have it's own world.

I was thinking a condom cath, FMS, corpak with several bags of Nutren, and some colace should cover me for that initial week, as long as I do a good thorough bowel prep a nigh or 2 before launch.  Chlorhex wipes to bathe on flights.  I miss anything?

---
So yeah, guides have been a thing since launch (and before - I'm sure many vanilla WOW players had D&amp;D guidebooks on broad class fantasy and such). 
---
The game has been out for 15 yrs, to pretend otherwise is daft. Even if you've never played WOW, if you've played any other rpg-esque game you'll see influences from WOW and certain conventions (that were novel in 2004) will be familiar.
---
Will some people follow a step-by-step guide to the letter; possibly. Will they have fun; I hope so. Is wandering around Barrens for hours in-game because you missed a subtle reference to a quest direction fun; not for me.
---
Have I read guides, yes, many. Most contradict each other to some extent, that's part of the fun of discovery. Most reference pservers which we know to be flawed instances of what will come in Aug. So they're useful at best rather than canonical.
---
Will I be following my own path; yes, but rather than blindly putting all my talent points into Arcane and wondering why I'm hitting like a wet noodle, I'll use my knowledge to build a better mage. I'm not min-maxing and I'm not no-life raiding, so I won't be using a cookie-cutter build. 
---
But I'm also not 12 and know the value of good research.
---
Having somebody tell me they were going to tell my guild leader that I mind controlled his wife off a cliff during a duel. He actually did and my guild leader messaged me about it. Couldn’t believe it lol

---
MC was very accessible to casuals even back in the day.
---
We used to auction MC and bwl gear because we should clear it 20 men. Back in the day.
---
Now, with all the added knowledge, with people coming in from the way harder retail raids, pve will be a joke.
---
I never got anything good on my druid in vanilla, but i always dreamed of t13 armor for him. In my opinion i always lacked either mana or health or damage and the high warlord set gave everything and then some. The attack power set bonus was ok. But the speed set bonus was sick! Again, coming from someone who never had any gear that is :)

7k armour and 4.3k HP unbuffed with no enchants. A shaman wearing a top-end shield isn't some clothie the warrior can just delete. I don't know how much physical damage reduction you're looking at, but it's a LOT.
---
Except different realms had different sizes in Vanilla...
---
So 3k is the perfect realm cap population, except when they decided to let higher population servers have 4k+ realm caps or when they would increase the cap of all realms over time.
---
Having all realms be capped at 3k would also be a change.

Extra cool hunters use Gnomish Mind Control Cap and Eyes of the Beast on the enemy faction before jumping them down into lava.
---
If you feel bad for killing the opposite faction then you might want to reconsider your game of choice since wow is literally about the horde vs alliance dynamic

You can be sarcastic as much as you want, but your eagerness to reply to everyone claiming you're just an envious, lonely guy kinda gives it away that there's definitely some truth in it. Dismiss it if you'd like to, I honestly don't care about you nor this thread.

I remember that one time I faced a 2H sham with the blacksmith mace (3sec stun proc) in arena. I was playing arms warrior / shamheal and they were Drood / Enhsham and they destroyed us. I was at 1800 - 2000 rating back then.

my lvl 1 bank alt has it,  but that was on a 4 year old low population p server, and even there I had to escort her with a lvl 60 or log in at 07:00 am or some other ungodly hour (the server used 01,04,07, 10 etc )
---
It is very good for a lvl 1 though. it still absorbs 1200 damage, so that mean you are  indestructible  when you get damage in batches of like 20 or 30.  
---
I mainly use it in Iron Forge, when some pvp breaks out between lvl 60s I like to charge in and do my part :D  I only do 3 damage because my weapon enchant always gets resisted, but  the look on their faces is priceless when that 900 damage instant doesn't kill  me :D
---
Gotta stock up on magic dusts and similar garbage.

I think I wouldn't have felt nearly as bad if it actually was "near my level", so that they would actually have posed some thread. But I was 39 and they were 26 or so.
---
Realistically, how often would you be threat restricted to DPS for full potential in raids?
---
16 yo here
---
I like suicide kings. Every week before raid, everyone rolls once. If you're at the top of the list you get first dibs. You can pass if you want to preserve your place at the top for something else that might drop. If you're at the bottom of the list, take any upgrades that the people above you have passed on since you're already at the bottom of the list so you dont lose out on anything by taking it.
---
Some items are good for multiple classes and specs; publish on your guild forums which class or spec has priority on which items, e.g. hunters prio on ranged weapons, rogues prio on DFT, etc. That way everyone knows beofre they go in to the raid whats up for grabs and what isnt.
---
People who are on the bench? Regularly turning up for bench duty gets you in the raid as soon as there's a spot for you.
---
Specialties like TF bindings? MT prio. If a binding drops and someone has the other one already, they get it. If you've got a sulfuron hammer already then you get the drop off rag.
---
If any two people have the same prereq, or they rolled the same on that weeks SK list, they roll against each other on the spot.
---
If a profession recipe like lionheart helm drops, anyone with 300 armorsmithing rolls for it.

Cheers, never managed to play classic but am looking forward to having to relearn the game again
---
So? How is that relevant to huntards? Are you implying that the "huntard" reputation is just about hunters clipping their rotation and get a bit less dps?
---
You are saying that because hunters have an easier time leveling they don't learn rotation and that is why there are so many bad hunters - that is just wrong.
---
Most classes don't even use the same rotation while leveling and raiding, so they don't practice it. This has absolutely nothing to do with it. Hunters got the "huntard" reputation because the class simply have so many mechanics that can make you look like a noob. Dumb pet AI that you need to know several "tricks" to not pull the whole dungeon, remember small things like turn growl off or buy enough ammo, having to kite properly, all those kind of things. It isn't because they clip their rotation, people would hardly even notice you do that.
---
There’s over 500 comments, I’ve responded to like 5. Sometimes I check reddit. Sometimes I don’t. But you got me dude, I’m lonely and wish I had a wife. You know me so well
---
You’re not ruining lives, you’re wasting time of people who’s time *does* have value au contraire to yours.
---
This inconvenience you caused them will make the world(of warcraft) more dangerous,and will force them to be more aware of their surroundings, so in a way you improved their gameplay experience, as now there's a real sense of danger.
---
If i am doing my own things in the world, and a lowbie bumps into me, i will one shot them and move on with my day, i won't bother to chase them if they manage to avoid my attack range as i run along the road. That way i am reminding the lowbie about the dangers of the contested pvp zones, while not really wasting my own time either. When it comes to stuff like corpse camping lowbies, that's way too much of a time commitment for me, thus i don't do it, but if some lowbie doesn't have the situational awareness to run and hide when they see me running along the road, it's their own fault.
---
Sort of off topic but are posts like this from retail? I didn't think classic was out yet.
---
Yeah it's so cool that is has no level requirement!
---
Exactly my point - it isn't like you have to practice your rotation all through leveling in order to do it. The other guy implies that the lack of "challenge" while leveling means hunters suck at their rotation and that is why they are huntards, which is an absurd notion. The "huntard" reputation isn't even about their rotation.

Pointless, tbh. A warlock can pull dungeons with eye or pet and actually do good AoE dps.
---
MORE THAN ONCE, I HAVE DREAMED OF GIVING UP THE CROWN!
---
Well, hunters have a rather complex rotation at 60 while at leveling you can just autoshot afk and still do just fine. Other classes have more complex leveling rotations and easy 60 rotations. Going from hard to easy is easier than from easy to hard.

DO YOU THINK IT'S HONOR THAT'S KEEPING THE PEACE?! IT'S FEAR! FEAR AND BLOOD!

I was wondering how are we supposed to get raid gear for elemental shaman for PvP. I was planning to play restoration shaman during phase 1 and 2 since healers have an easier time getting spots on raids, but my actual goal is to respec to elemental so I can play PvP when battlegrounds are added in phase 3. As a healer doing raids, would people let me roll on caster DPS gear or would I have to play elemental for that, which might be a problem since that spec isn't that optimal for raiding?
---
This is why this sub sucks.
---
MY, YOU'RE A PRETTY ONE! AND YOUR NAME IS?
---
my dream was to rank up, by only doing pvp against lvl 60s, but alas, it didn't happen enough to get 15  HKs in a week.  My record was 4 HKs
---
Playing chess is a previously agreed-upon competative activity. The WoW-equivalent would be queuing up for a BG.
---
Ganking greys is more like the equivalent of taking away the shovel from a toddler in a sandbox.
---
this whole debate boils down to:
---
\- do you want to be part of the 5-10% of really serious players?  then don't go "non meta"
---
\- are you a reasonably fun person who is willing to put in a wee bit more effort?  then find a guild that will take you - it won't be that hard
---
In our case if we had people from outside we stated loot rules before start and there were cases when something cool dropped (raid or dungeon) and even when our guild MT needed it - it had to be an open roll as we didn't reserved that item beforehand. Our guild master was very transparent with such stuff so the guild had a good reputation.
---
That’s actually super relevant
---
They will last longer than Vanilla.
---
I have no idea how long each of them will last, but all of them will probably last closer to 3 years, instead closer to 2 years.
---
"My boy tells me how to think and I listen."
---
I raided as a spriest back in vanilla and on private servers. 
---
As some people here already pointed out, you'll either get your dps gear as a healer (with or without shadow weaving) when your guild has the content on farm. Or you'll find a (probably more casual) guild that will let you dps. There won't be a lot of spots for you as a shadow priest so you'll have to be lucky with finding a guild. But it is possible and a lot of fun.
---
You could also consider running your own weekly pug group where you atleast got the chance to roll for loot against the other casters.
---
Outside of raiding you can get decent blues in the 60s dungeons. Plus the blue pvp set is nice for you, especially the set bonus with two pieces.
---
What’s the 2.5 set called? I never raided vanilla and I’ve always been confused about the “.5” sets
---
The difference between t2 human and gnome warlock is 0.3% crit and maybe one extra shadowbolt if even that.
---
The difference between a human rogue with sword spec and night elf rogue with sword spec is more significant, something like 5%. However, nonhumans have the option of going with combat daggers and later seal of fate daggers, leaving the sword drops for humans and taking the daggers instead.
---
I don't really care much about min/maxing the leveling process. But at end game I will try to min/max my character for what I am trying to accomplish.
---
I did not make my class and race decisions based on min/maxing.
---
OP trying to get himself banned. Nothing cringier than a petition.
---
I thought the same lol, I didnt say it cause I would get downvoted again :(
---
Yeah that makes sense. P.S. I can post on reddit if I want to. So chill out and just ignore the stuff you don't like. It's a free world whether you like it or not.
---
Lol... no you are not. People are going to hit 60 3.5-4d /played and clear most of MC in first reset.
---
I remember when I played WoW a year ago. r/wow is seriously one shitty subreddit. 0 substance and quality content discussion, 100 fluff bullshit.
---
The usual level time for new players is around 8-10 days /played. This can go down to 5-6 when playing efficiently and knowing what you are doing, and hell even lower if you mastered leveling. So with 12-15 hours weekly that puts you at around 20 weeks or 5 months to hit 60. Probably a bit shorter since you will have a lot of rested experience from playing this "little".
---
As for gearing for raids it varies a lot on luck class and how active the server is but after a month or doing so you will definitely be ready to enter a raid. Raiding takes around 7-10 hours weekly early on and then upwards of 20 hours later with consume farming included so with your weekly hours you should be able to be a raider once you actually finish the leveling/gearing.
---
I very well could be.  You make an interesting point that maybe I should play an anti-paladin instead, and stay true to my heritage.  Ele shaman is the most appealing of that list (mostly because I played one, and clothies don't interest me that much)- do they really have that much of an edge over a paladin?
---
Looks inaccurate. Last time i played a rogue guild leader took thunderfury
---
I love the support healer role in BGs for the reasons you outlined. Not sure why you want to respec retri, maybe for novelty? I'm currently torn between pala and horde druid. As a vanilla wow horde shaman, can I really bring myself to play a palamadin...
---
Do a flip.
---
I played a lot of Holy Paladin from Vanilla to Wrath and while much of what you said is true about their healing prowess, they have to actually cast to heal and get counter spelled very easily by someone who knows what they are doing. (Fakecasting helps occasionally.)
---
Quite frankly I always found healing on my druid more satisfying and has a much higher skillcap IMO.
---
Add game time to whichever one you want, and play on it as per usual.
---
My bad then
---
I'm sorry, I don't think you read my message to the end... I'm well aware that Shamans are king here, but I was asking if you had suggestions for Alliance side.
---
Someone suggested Priest with Spirit Tap, would that be better than a Paladin with Devotion Aura and Blessing of Might for the melees?
---
I assume you're Horde by now, but an educated guess is more than enough:)
---
My bad
---
Dafuq,I've quitted smoking and gained 17kgs
---
How can ones time be more valuable than another when you are playing the game? if it was so precious, they would be doing something important with the time they had.
---
So you would change the most fun class to play, regardless of it's flaws and quirks for a 1button class simply because they give you a hard time sometimes?
---
But what if the gnome has pink pigtails?
---
You are kind of wrong, though. You completely ignore a group of players that is way bigger than your group (1). People that are *not* elitist "omg I'm so hardcore", yet enjoys theorycrafting and trying to optimize. MMORPG have always had a massive amount of players that enjoys these kind of things, and it doesn't mean you are suddenly one of those annoying try-hard elitist kids.
---
Also, you say those actual try-hard elitist people will burn out, how exactly do you explain them playing for literally a decade and still be hyped for Classic? More likely than not, many years from now they are the only people that still play the game. Your assumption that they burn out is totally against what we have seen so far from those players.
---
Also, your reasons for them to burn out, optimal spec, consumables etc. are in your eyes clearly a bad thing, but for hardcore gamers it isn't. They enjoy trying to optimize. It's like saying athletes burn out because they have to exercise all the time and you don't like it - well, clearly the athletes do.
---
Stop trying to say hardcore players = elitist jerks. Just because you don't enjoy challenging yourself and are okay with being lazy doesn't mean everyone else feel good about that. You are judging a whole group of people based on a vocal minority of shitheads. Hardcore players are more often than not great people that enjoy making a challenge for themselves and often enjoy helping other people learn the game. Just look at how many guides or great comments at "noob threads" made by people trying to help. You just remember that jerk that made you throw your keyboard across the room a lot more.
---
&gt;they are useless after L58.
---
Because by 58/59, they're going to want to respec Holy and start farming their Holy pre BiS if they ever plan on raiding @ 60. Alternatively they will respec AT 60, but better to have a healing set ready and g2g.
---
&gt;i dont think most pallys want to tank 40man raids.
---
Exactly my point. Even if they DID want to, they're going to be sorely disappointed.
---
&gt;running strat with a pally tank is much better than a warrior, 
---
This is debatable, but at the end if the day any decent prot pally can tank any 5 man with ease, even at 60, which is exactly what I said in my original comment. The problem is, they're ambition must be very very low if they never plan on doing more than just 5 mans. Want to do lbrs, ubrs, MC/Ony? Then you better be Holy and you better have a Holy set. N2m I can't imagine trying to heal strat run in full Prot gear, or rolling against your Priest healer for pre BiS.

No, you.
---
Did they merge in retail or why is it they have the exact same Pop?
---
But this isn't vanilla/classic populations is it?
---
I mean it certainly gives me an idea but it can be very different for classic... No clue what can be derived from that...
---
I just think it would be fair for them to have a Server too - may it be dead or alive I don't care I don't want to Play there :P
---
But as we all want to relive our classic experience I just thought it would be fair...
---
All bets are off in STV
---
They’ll do what they do for retail WoW and base most of their decisions on metrics.
---
What percentage of players are 60? Of those, how many have cleared X? How many have epic mount? Etc etc
---
Ignores armor, purges buffs, ranged snares and aoe slows, huge burst.
---
Yes. Bring a paladin down to ~60% then just do your ranged or cqc wombo combo to kill him.
---
I'm still happy with the 144hz 1080p Benq I bought some years back. They have monitors offering that well within your price range.

If it'll make you feel better, I'm sure someone will camp you for redemption.

That's  fine, makes no real difference aside the volume of runecloth I'd inevitably need to turn in anyway

Shut up
---
No
---
The changes in gameplay are tremendous between classic and nowadays. But the general sentiment of melees not really bothering to attack you when there's other targets, is the same. Especially if you position yourself in a way that makes you less accessible to them.
---
However, other classes won't make this kind of a difference. All the casters, aswell as hunters are not afraid of attacking a Paladin. If you want to be even harder to kill, you might want to consider playing a druid. Their tools of getting away from harm are the best.

As if holy cows wouldnt be enough. Gieb classic xS

i have some young co-workers (18-22) who have said they are going to play classic since they saw there older brother playing it and want to see what it is all about.
---
as for younger people that is hard to say but having classic WoW fight agenst fortnite is just funny to think about in terms of pacing.
---
Don't go hybrid with limited play time. Druid is macro heavy and you may have to manage multiple gear. Tanking requires a considerable time investment, also macro heavy due to stance dancing, and with your available time raid tanking is off the table. I would go Priest, not macro heavy, easy to get into, leveling is a blast when you have Wand Spec and Spirit Tap talents, the leveling rotation is easy.  Healing is not that complicated, you can do all content as a healer even with the same talents so you don't have to respec constantly (if you don't have much time the constant need to respec may end up in you leaving the game). If you decide to go Priest I can share you my "guide" where I put together a least effort / maximum efficiency route to getting yourself raid ready. I'm planning to play around 20 hours  a week, which is a bit more than your expected time.
---
🙌 Preach
---
For the average first-time offender, yes. We don't know the context of the OPs account. Any previous strikes against the player could lead to a permanent action vs temp. I didn't want to assume OP had a clean record given a mentioned history of client modification, so I erred on the side of caution.
---
I'd say hunter or mage. With limited time time to play those classes are easy to solo and get groups if you want.
---
(Vanilla) WoW just isnt a hard game overall. Dont tell that to the fanatics that act like WoW and especially vanilla is the hardest game ever made though.
---
Where can I find any of these guides?
---
Exactly, I was never a raider I really only enjoyed pvp. The raids being harder to attend made them much more mysterious for me but I chose to spend my time pvping. Although I did do some basic raiding I never got fully into it. 
---
When I did get invited for example to black temple (because I was a full s3 enhance shaman) it felt amazing!  But the exact opposite was when I did my first AND ONLY LFR raid It felt so dumb and unrewarding
---
&gt; kinda makes me doubt you were around back then
---
You think vanilla start AND classic are exactly the same ? If speedrunners are beating the old world records to L40 by massive amount.
---
"Sometimes you can't get anyone else" 
---
What a great recommendation for meme specs :)
---
Then they aren’t going to do the content, it’s as simple as that. The game shouldn’t cater to those who can only dedicate 2 hours a WEEK to the game. That’s partially what ruined retail.
---
Im an adult who works 10 hours a day minus weekends and I can still put in 6-7hrs a day, there’s no excuse for 2 hours a week
---
I was deployed for two years and when i came back my son was already six months old, now he is 5 and can level up my fishing, here is a crappy cellphone picture of him playing his level seven warrior in full intellect cloth gear with messed up UI im so proud of him #blessed
---
Ye I figured. Could not resist the joke. :b
---
Outlaw rogue. 
---
Wait, wrong sub. 
---
Mage or warlock would indeed be best. 
---
As always when people post these things. I want you to be aware that levelling as a prot warrior is a waste of time. Arms and fury are better both at solo play and at tanking.
---
Well it was true in PvP at least. Prowl around in cat, stun some poor fool, get some bleeds going, switch to bear and maul his face, root him, throw some heals, couple of nukes, rocketbear to the face. So much fun.
---
When i played a holy pala i refused to wear a dress, went into naxx with blue pants.
---
It's less important on mages than say warriors or rogues since you can blink out of roots, however, human only has stealth detection on 3min timer to work with, so gnome is still the minmax choice just for +15 engineer and root break.
---
Can we ban all the posts about people talking about their “adult lifestyle” and “adult schedule” too
---
Likely.  I'm 29 and gonna be a rogue officer in classic.  I played a fury warrior in retail vanilla on day 1 and raided and did the rank grind.  It's gonna be very different given my responsibilities as an adult now that's doubled in age.
---
If a product or service is free then the users are the real product

&gt;  N2m I can't imagine trying to heal strat run in full Prot gear, or rolling against your Priest healer for pre BiS.
---
The neck and idol are added so late that you can be in much better gear than pre-bis. And whos saying you are rolling against a priest ? Two pallys can team up and do the runs until both have the neck.

If roles were reversed I might have been annoyed at first, until they told me that was the only node they could mine. Then I'd be very happy taking the remaining 5-6 nodes instead of having to split it 50/50.

 I get that loot stealing sucks though, been in a party with people and they just rush up to a chest after I've suggested we roll for it. and made a roll. They loot everything and want to continue on as if nothing happened, the nerve!  In those situations I just say "next chest is mine" rather than getting upset with them.   
---
Sometimes it's weird, I'm right by a node, someone runs up and starts mining it, then gets annoyed when I also start mining it because they 'got there first'. No, I was here first!  but it's not worth getting unhappy about, it's just digital ore at the end of the day, and most of the time people aren't meaning to do anything bad.
---
Lies, that second monitor is so you can roll pally and jerk your dick raw red before you even hit Westfall
---
I dont get this.  I have never used an Auto Shot timer and manage my rotation fine using sound/character animation and learning the rhythm.  Hunter rotation is all about rhythm to me.  Shoot -Multi - Shoot -  Aimed - Shoot - Shoot - Shoot - Mutli -Shoot - Aimed - Shoot etc. etc.  As long as you can get into the rhythm of it its pretty simple to maintain.  Personally only use Aimed/Multi immediately after a shot, so worst case is I miss a slot between  autoshots and have to wait for the next one ~2 secs later.
---
Somebody doesn't know their lore, lol.
---
My warlock uses summon succubus
---
You can water walking on yourself and then go stand in the ocean for Fishing, and not worry about aggroing mobs on shore.
---
Wouldn't really say there is an etiquette, if I'm clearing mobs for a node and someone comes steals it, I'll just do it back to them, you'll probably never see them again and if you do, you both won't remember it if
---
Everyone wants to be the next Monkeynews.
---
Are you sure? Because it won't even take 5hours to run MC. 
---
After you're 60 and in pre-raid bis raid logging suddenly becomes a thing.
---
Do you still need to use the ogre suit?
---
Play what makes you happy do what you want to do and be the best you out there and you will find a home we all will.
---
I really think the problem is competitive making casual/recreational look bad by making it competitive and so people who don't intend to be competitive are treated/rated as if they are competitive and inferior based on their relaxed performance. It's really a social thing that happens in almost every hobby and profession where people gather in life. There isnt anything wrong with either group and both belong in the game but when they cross over there will be a lot of frustration from both sides. The competitive players feeling upset they play with people who "don't care" etc. I'm not kidding when I say labels such as relaxed/baddie and focused/tryhard would solve a lot of this so the groups could avoid each other where there would be trouble.
---
different era now... everyone wants a guide lol
---
Nobody in private servers has done 5-man instance levelup, because mobs hit much harder and theres is much bigger XP penalty compared to classic.
---
And... https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cc044u/cauthonluck_finishes_troll_hunter_140_speedrun_in/ So if he gets ahead of the launch rush, that could be about 4d played run in launch.
---
I don't know how that's gonna work, tbh. That Arcane Nullifiers make everything around them immune to magic for like 10 seconds. In this video they could still be slowed by Blizzard, but I dunno if that's how it works in Classic.
---
I agree that Warrior and Mage are gonna be the big cheese, with Druid being the bottom
---
I also thought for a long time, that Rogue and shaman would be high-ish, but I’m starting to think that Rogue might be more of an alt class and shaman could end up in the Druid situation, of other classes just being better at the different things
---
So outside Warrior, Mage and Druid, I think they could end up in any order, at least for Horde, dunno wtf alliance will do
---
Lmao, do you know how ridiculous you sound. Hey I work 10 hours a day but I still put in 6-7 hours a day. Basically u get shit sleep, go to work and play wow nonstop until sleep. That’s 16-17 hours of work + wow. Ok bro congrats you have no life other than a job. Some people actually socialize.
---
Couldn't disagree more. 
---
You are effected by those around you in the world (of Azeroth).
---
Scenario:
---
We're all in middle school and out for summer. We all ride our beach cruiser bikes down to the mall every day and kick it. We all have a similar experience. Sure some try hards pedal their faces off and get there a bit quicker, albeit covered in sweat, to scope the mall first. We all have a similar shared experience that we bond over. However, if everyone starts riding sweet mopeds and zipping by you on your antiquated cruiser. Eventually, watching everyone put in half the work to get there before you do and you now notice your once companion fill ride is a bit lonely as no one is sharing the same experience you are. Cruiser time gets a bit less rewarding.
---
Comparing retail to classic is like comparing driving a car to flying a plane. Sure they're fundamentally similar processes, but experiencing one does not inform you in any way about the other. Paladin especially is one of the most different classes in retail than its original form. I recommend that you watch some vanilla paladin pvp gameplay to get a better understanding of what it's like.
---
&gt;I see tons of videos about how to pick a class and all that kind of stuff but it never goes into very much detail about how each classes pros and cons will work with a certain amount of playtime.
---
They actually do, just not directly. Think about it, BG queues are the same for all classes, raids won't be faster because of your class (there are 39 other people, after all). Most content will be the same time-wise no matter what class you pick.
---
So what actually matter? Only a few things, really.
---
* Leveling speed matters at the start - it means you can play less and still get to 60 without being too far behind everyone else. If you don't care about that it won't really matter.
---
* The biggest overall pro is probably gold farming. The more gold you can farm on a class per hour, the better for someone without much time to play.
---
* . Some classes simply have a lot less competition to gear and thus you can raid maybe only once per week instead of twice and still feel you progress properly with your gear.
---
* An attractive class. If you don't have a lot of time it can be easier to get a good guild if they really want your class. If you hardly have time to ever help your guild and your class is generally shitty, then you might feel it is harder to get a raid spot. If your class is really strong people will bring you not for the player, but the class.
---
Hunter is a prime example of a good class for people with little time to play. Fastest leveler, among (if not the) best at farming gold, really easy to gear up (can go full tier, so less competition and your main weapon type is not shared with other classes) and first few raids they are really strong DPS - after that they still bring unique utility that is required
---
Rogue is a bit harder to gear (lots of competition), but fairly good farmers and really attractive class. Warlocks are really attractive (especially for alliance), solid farmers and great at leveling.
---
So while guides won't directly state it, they often provide the information needed for you to judge how well suited they are for you.
---
Take what you can, give nothing back.
---
Frost Mage is the ultimate CC support.
---
It's incredible how much u can do with just r1 Frostbolt and Polymorph in a bg 😍
---
20 priests REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Let's say you play 7 hours a day so around 50 hours a week. You will deffo not be 55 or 60 in week 2.
---
World record for 60 is just under 4 days played . 
---
At minimum you'll be 60 in 3 or 4 weeks with 50hr weeks.
---
&gt; Obviously warriors are just superior in some fights
---
I heard it went both ways, that Druids are superior for other fights and it kinda evens out, right?
---
I find it funny that guides and walkthroughs bother someone. Don't read them? I've learned helpful things from friends, strangers in game, from trial and error, and yes, from guides as well. I know information scares some people, but don't let it. Or, you know, just ignore it.
---
I swear i got their later model the last onw they made round 2010 still love it more than my 120hz and 144hz monitor.
---
I got the 24” AOC last week. Probably turned it on 3 times for a total of 2-3 hrs screen time and now it’s got a massive red line through it. No clue why. Definately not a gfx card issue.
---
I’m sending it back but... you should get something else bro
---
 Unless you dedicate half of your life to playing this game you will not have a chance.
---
Exactly, which is why I think it is dumb to advice new players that some classes are hard, so better pick something else. No class is hard. Doesn't matter if this is your first RPG ever, heck your first video game ever. All class rotations are sufficiently easy to learn that you can pick anything and do well in raids.
---
People get recommended not to go classes they might honestly have enjoyed immensely because some fanatics try to make Classic into something its not.
---
Depends who you are trying to keep up with. The average player is casual. The hardcore players, yea you will never catch up for years. But you can still have a great time moving at your own pace. Don't forget even if you are 'behind' and hit 60 way later, there will be a ton of people with no gear and in the same spot as you.. other casuals and alts.
---
Oh shit really? I guess Blackcrow then?
---
Yes it is. If you put 15 hours a week and grind the 60 level in 8 days (which is reasonably efficient with rested xp, you will grind in 3 months, which is going to be aligned with lots of people (me included)
---
The only thing you will need to look for is a guild (a casual/progression one) to be able to raid, but if you know how to write an application, it should be fine :)
---
If you need help coping, perhaps you can convince yourself wpvp is just an extend milgram experiment 
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment
---
Well the easy answer is that you won't be able to keep up. Like anything else, there will be players that devote much more time to the game than you will and will be further along in the advancement of their characters as a result. 
---
The important thing to note is that unless you're a hardcore player, leveling is not a race but a journey. You'll hit 60 eventually, you'll gear up in PVE/PVP and you'll be able to compete with the other non-hardcore players, but this game rewards people who put in more hours and thats just how it is. Don't worry about it and just enjoy the game at your own pace.
---
Why do you have to go to the comments section of wowhead for any useful info?
---
Take it if you can, its a free for all
---
I had a player run up to me while I was mining a node and tried to mine it. Naturally I didn´t care and carried on. He just typed ignore in chat and ran away. If he just wanted the skillup he could have said so but noope not a word before.
---
Yep I thought about bringing up that very valid point. But then I realised that people would probably argue that casual guilds don't care much about raid progress. And while I disagree, I can't disprove it.
---
Shush Cernas
---
Druid. Single character that can fill all roles to a satisfactory level for what you are going to be doing.  Also allows you to focus all your time on a single character which will enable you to achieve better broader results.
---
Shaman
---
Hey man.. I have 32" 144hz 1440p monitor and it is a great experience...
---
I swapped from 21:9 34" which I enjoyed even more.. therefore, I highly recommend you to consider ultrawide as well.. the space for icons and spells is endless...
---
Kiting and pulling?
---
Innervate
---
I noticed that, too. Conflicting messages.
---
"Play whatever, you don't need to minmax"
---
"Choosing that particular race class combo is pointless and doesn't offer much!"
---
Live in Europe is my plan!
---
Not really fussed, I did Naxx the first time around.
---
Yeah basically why I said arguably since there are situations when dwarf racial could be more handy than escape artist. But overall I’d say escape artist is better. People forget that you don’t have to be the best pve racial to clear naxx. They didn’t design the game so you had to be a specific race in each class in order to beat the game. Which is why it’s better to pick your race based on pvp advantages if you plan to pvp. Most guilds will understand this aspect of the game if they are worth anything.
---
Idk why this game is treated as the second coming of Jesus but it's an old game that many of us have played multiple times at this point. Allow me to know better how I want to play it. Now if Blizzard actually made a new MMO that wasn't complete shit I'd be all for them NOT handing out all the info to websites auch as Wowhead before the actual release. That's not going to happen though, since Blizzard is planning to go full mobile/casino.
---
Aimed multi auto, but multi aimed auto if the mob is low hp. Tbh I can't remember it off of the top of my head but if you want to do good dps as a hunter it's far more complicated than spamming frostbolt or whatever.
---
I always played on pvp servers, and I always just waved at the opposing faction players. If they wanted a fight, they got it, but I never felt the need to be the instigator. I would kill obvious bots, however. Bots are pretty easy to pick out.
---
How did you choose who actually got picked for raids once you had 100~ people?
---
&gt;  I like playing on a PvP-server to have this sense of luring danger. Being attacked and trying to defend myself. Or fleeing and trying to hide.
---
But... that's what you're giving to those other players. Those players want that too. That's why they rolled PvP. *You're* the lurking danger in this scenario.
---
This post is like, "I want to play on a PvP server so everyone else can shoulder the responsibility of playing the lurking dangerous bad guy FOR me, and I get to feel like the good guy."
---
I actually have the hardest time clicking gnomes sometimes.
---
This is solid advice. It will be easy to make dungeon groups as a warrior!
---
2/10
---
Most of the streamers said they are going to play PVE servers so they wont get ganked into oblivion.  Having said that I don't think having a streamer on your server would be entirely negative.  If they have attract people who like the game enough to watch streams then you have better odds of having skilled players to play with who will probably stick with it longer than someone who just logged in for the memberberrys
---
You wont keep up with the hardcore players. Good news is the vast majority of the playerbase wont either so find some people playing at your speed and have fun making memories.
---
I don't want to know how to do ANYTHING
---
&gt; means 'greater than'.
---
I think your last sentence is how i'd handle it. But that person just seems like they were a cock, so at that point any etiquette or politeness goes out the window and it's a free for all
---
Please don't tell me "Sturmwind" and "Schlingendornental" (oh dear god please no) is a thing?!
---
iirc only dialogues and abilities etc was in german back those days, names / cities etc in english?
---
Old 2004 Vet Hunter here.....Here are some personal tips to help you have the best experience possible;
---
* Be respectful and kind to other players (except for the alliance) no matter how kind or unkind they may be towards you and the whole "Huntard" stigma that is sadly coming back in full force much as it was in 2005-2006.
---
* Stick your neck out for fellow Horde in the world, regardless of Class. You'll be remembered.
---
* Remember that you have a Server Reputation to uphold, as most of the people you run into, you WILL run into again, frequently probably.
---
* You'll likely have to constantly prove yourself as not a "Huntard", which is stupid, but it's a thing due to the "Huntard" word being a buzzword and the cool mob mentality thing to do is... use it. /sigh
---
* Even if they're total jerks, continue being cool about things and shrug off the ass-hattery. Just continue saying you did your best, and will continue adapting and improving. You can't avoid the salty toxic dickhats and elitists that constantly and immediately blame something on someone anytime something goes wrong. Not to fully discount complaints, so just analyze your playstyle fairly and see if it applies or not. Most people will be friendly, don't worry.
---
* Know that your main damage abilities are Multishot, Aimed Shot, and Autoshot. I wouldn't bother with Arcane, Immolation Trap, Explosive Trap, or Serpent pretty much at all, ever(they're mostly just not mana efficient). Arcane is decent early on, for kiting scenarios. Volley is OK in groups, but usually the Mage handles AE damage. 
---
* Do not try to be a "Tank" of any kind, much less any other weird role outside of "Ranged DPS" that pops into your head. Don't try to be an "Arcane" hunter either. It's a very bad build unless that coefficient changes one day.
---
* Be aware of your surroundings(zoom in and pay attention to your radar and whatever tracking you have on) as often as possible as not to pull things, and stay 7 yards or more behind your tank. Don't hesitate to call things out to the group if you see a rando mob slowly pathing towards you guys. 
---
* Be aware of \*roughly\* how far your Multishot can reach between targets, so you don't accidentally pull extras or break CC effects. There will be several cases where you just can't use your Multishot.
---
* Always keep a Freezing trap down somewhere in Dungeons for each pull of enemies. Always lay a trap down behind or in front of you in general, so if adds come in you can kite them to it and likely have your cooldown finished for traps by then.
---
* Anytime you go to jump down or go through weird pathing, dismiss your pet first.
---
* Keep your pet on Passive, ALWAYS, and learn to use CTRL+1/2 for their abilities or some other key binding you create. Otherwise just stay aware of where your pet is or headed.
---
* Turn off your pets Growl in Dungeons unless needed or wanted by the group. Same for Dash/Dive.
---
* Don't be afraid to pull mobs for the tank - Just do your best and slowly gauge the radius of which that mob you pulled, can potentially pull other mobs with it. If there are any pathing mobs, let them pass further away before pulling.
---
* Do your best to only roll Need on Mail armor(post level 40) with Agility, Attack Power, and/or Crit or Hit. Leather is acceptable too, but be mindful of Rogues and Druids before you roll on it. Otherwise roll Greed or Pass. Avoid the temptation that is "shiny melee weapons", unless it's a 2H with a high top end damage and/or Agility. If it has STR or something on it, you may want to Greed it so Warriors or Rogues etc or whatever can Need it. 
---
* BM is a great talent tree to make your pet strong and level a little faster, and it's good in every pve scenario except Raids. It's a pleasant surprise in pvp until people learn your tricks and figure out how to waste your cooldown, and absolutely destroy you afterwards. Always go minimum 20 points in MM regardless of your choice, for the obvious talents that have the biggest impact on your class.
---
* Consider 17/31/3 build for Raiding and 0/24/27 for PvP at level 60. Perhaps a weird mixture of both so you don't have to respect often. You should keep Scatter Shot either way. Sadly BM doesn't really hold up for Raiding due to a lot of Pet-related issues.
---
* Don't pay attention to "damage charts" \*as a source of importance\* and other shit that makes you rethink a class. Play whatever looks fun and feels good, and I promise you'll have an amazing couple of years. :) There is a need for every class and \*most\* specs in raids.
---
* Hunters do have a much higher ceiling when it comes to pvp in order to be good. Duels will be very hit and miss since most people tend to start the match inside of your asshole. You'll end up being pretty damn good in world pvp.
---
Good luck out there, and happy hunting
---
I was first thinking that with the massive pulls, arent you going to hit the instance reset limit, but as big as the instances are, im sure you can spend enough time to kill something worth while before reset. Or it will take you time to get to that big pull spot.
---
Going to be super tricky pulls, one frost nova in the wrong time and you just lost a ton of time. Melee cleave is much more chill, every melee can tank a elite for certain amount of time (and regarding warriors, bouncing aggro is nice for extra rage).
---
I mean maybe say that its only beta observation? Someone is genuinly asking a question, i think they would like to get facts
---
I'm very curious what these people commenting the top comments actually want to discuss. All I'm seeing is people project things that they're pretty worked up about and can't just downvote and ignore.
---
You will be fine until you get to raiding. To give you an idea a guild could clear mc in 3-6 hours and that's like the first one in the progression.
---
And we are along for the joke. Hence the Heresy comments.
---
Yes inquisitor, this one here
---
Ohh well - I guess demand is not the highest then...
---
Still Need data for classic :D
---
I just feel bad for the People who really wish to Play on one - but I guess it is like with most of the language Servers... Just not worth it...
---
I give you this one! :)
---
Sweet man thanks. 
---
I was looking at 1440p 32”. However I’ll be playing on a laptop and connecting the monitor to the laptop. My laptop is 1080p. Can I connect a 1440p screen to a 1080p laptop?
---
No ogre suit necessary!
---
Ya skill up is where it’s at. But when we start talking rich thorium is when we have to think about the etiquette. I know people are greedy af with those bad boiz
---
Yeah it’s because I’m so lonely without a gf or wife dude what are you talking about? I’ve admitted it. I need help talking to women. Help me
---
I don't care how many months it takes avg. People it's about ingame time. Hell the avg time to 60 on a pserver recently was 12 days played
---
Yes, but I wouldn't underestimate them.
---
One makes the person immune to all forms of crowd control.
---
Another makes them immune to all damage, although they can't deal damage themselves while it's on. 
---
There isn't a really "bard" or "mezzer" class in this game that specializes in buffs/crowd control.
---
Karma whores are gross
---
Big reminder that reddit is groupthink and the upvote/downvote system is supposed to objectively show what people like to see and don't like to see. 
---
My point; this subreddit enjoys trash media.
---
Yeah that's why forums aren't dead these days 🙄
---
So I just looked into it and I think priest would be fun for a couple of reasons.  Apparently they have two pretty strong support roles: Shadoweaving and Power Infusion, and some guilds like to have one priest that can do both!  That is something I find awesome and maybe I can carve out a niche in some PvE groups!
---
 &lt;Eternal&gt; NA PVP - Loot Council - Hardcore
---
Eternal is looking for more dedicated raiders for our roster! We are group of players who met in recent private servers looking to group up into Classic. Our background is one of few REAL 15/15 Naxx clears, and with some of the fastest clears ever recorded for Naxxramas.
---
We will begin raiding somewhere in the 2nd or 3rd week. We are not requiring our members to be ready to go in that timeframe, but you should be ready to go somewhere within 5 weeks. As we have experience leading pug raids, we will pug MC raiders until we have a full guild raid.
---
We will have guild premades and many people ranking into the 12+ range. We bring experience from private servers and real motivation for ranking, as we have done it on private servers and know what it entails. Our raids will be either the fastest on the server or very close. We will not require hardcore consumables on content that is on farm every week (Flasks).
---
Our goal is to be top dog without enabling an unfun and toxic environment like other hardcore guilds, leading to guild breakup.
---
Raid days are Tuesday + Wednesday at 5PM PST / 8PM EST. Will be running 2nd pug raids on Saturdays sometime in the late morning / early afternoon.
---
If you want to apply/join, please message me or the other officers mentioned in our discord server. [https://discord.gg/KHqSB64](https://discord.gg/KHqSB64)
---
Most of this sub is just memes and shitposts and other low-effort crap at this point because there's really nothing much to discuss; we're all just twiddling our thumbs waiting for August 27th.
---
90cm from a PC monitor?! I think you're gonna *need* a 32", if not bigger.
---
Officially the dungeon sets are called just that; Dungeon Set 1 and Dungeon Set 2. They never really caught on for some reason, but those are the official names.  
---
    
---
Silly players sticking with community dubs after official names are released :p
---
While retail data is relevant, so too is the big Classic survey (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScSKhcR57Lpsk4YIEWO-u-88xEXoZo2rT6mF9gl27ctRpcOlg/viewanalytics), which indicates RPPvP is ~3x as desired as RPPvE. Which I believe is what OP was referring to.
---
Why do you have to checklist? Are you gonna try to be the first guy to level 60? If so, this tiny checklist will never suffice.
---
Instead, be prepared to have a little fun. High school is over man, nobody is gonna judge your leveling speed anymore, you are free :D
---
I’m a teacher in 7th-9th grade, and although there are alot of gamers in my school i haven’t met anyone who plays wow. It’s all about Fortnite and games like that. No one plays MMO’s at all at my school so i believe that the majority of the players will be around 25-30 years old. I think there’s a social stigma around playing MMO’s these days. It’s too nerdy and i don’t think its socially accepted. FPS-games however is way more accepted and i think it’s because it is quite shallow without major storylines etc like MMO’s.
---
Btw, where do you get the skateboard?

# &lt;That’s Rough Buddy&gt; |A| NA EST PvP
---
Is a group of individuals who have a deep passion for World of Warcraft. Some of us even meeting back in 2005 creating great friendships that have lasted 14+ years. Currently our roster is sitting at 30+ dedicated members who are active on discord or playing together on private servers to pass the time waiting for release.
---
We are looking for all players who want to be part of a Semi-Hardcore guild planning to be in the top 5 for our server to clear Naxxramas. This will mean raiding 2-3 times a week with attendance needing to be on the high side as well as knowledge of your class or willingness to learn to help us get over those hurdles on tough boss fights.
---
Raid Schedule for Phase 1:
---
Tuesday - 7-10pm EST (Molten Core)  
---
Wednesday - 7-10pm EST (Molten Core if not finished, Onyxia’s Lair)  
---
Monday - 7-10pm EST (Optional day if we need for Molten Core clears)
---
Our raiding philosophy is to have fun while staying focused and clearing content at a fast pace. Watching boss strategies, proving you understand the boss encounters and your role will be required to join raid groups as well as a minimum gear level with full enchants and consumables. Once those requirements have been met, mistakes won’t be punished, we’re here to laugh, to cry, to kill and get killed by bosses as a team.
---
Loot will be Loot Council based:
---
We will be keeping track of attendance as well as amounts of gear acquired.  
---
Loot will be dealt with a couple things in mind by our council members:
---
How has this person contributed to the guild?  
---
Does this person show up on time and regularly to raids?  
---
Does this person know their class and perform?  
---
Who will this piece of gear benefit the most to help the guild as a whole?
---
Currently recruiting every class besides fury warriors.
---
Please add me on discord @Smalls#5019 for more information!.
---
Ohh. So they're still vulnerable to AoE, since reflection only works on single target?
---
Interesting.
---
Disenchant until it does not provide you coin anymore (50 or 75). Try to sell low lvl wands if you can
---
What about the gnomish cloaking device from eng? I feel like I've seen a pvp video of a mage using in combat
---
Not at all. It’s so i have a clean experience, with every aspect of the game. Eg. proffesions while leveling, getting dungeon-quests at appropriate level.
---
Yes they do. It’s also ridiculous to expect someone playing a hunter to become a nightfall bot when you have perfectly capable offtanks who can do the same thing whilst also performing their role. Hunters are a ranged class, yes, you can weave raptor strikes but it’s still a ranged class. Why anyone would roll a hunter with the sole intention of being a nightfall bot is beyond me.
---
Do you think a holy paladin would be a good alternative?
---
BoM BoW BoK Purify Resurrection LoH Cleanse All auras BoP and a lot more depend on spec
---
You're talking a specific, niche situation. I'm talking overall.
---
A prot pally can tank any 5 man as well as lvl easily 1-60. However, 9 times out of 10 you'll want to respec Holy around lvl 58 and start farming your healing set/pre bis, unless you never plan on raiding. That said, I can't imagine someone rolling a PVE spec (prot) and never wanting to raid. So at some point you'll have to respec anyway. That's why you'll almost never see a prot pally at 60, to answer OPs question
---
You can use leatherworking and tailoring to craft gear to disenchant.
---
I mean, if a set’s only asset is the 8/8 bonus, I wouldn’t say it’s great. Means you can’t use engi helmets for example. Or spider belt. Or engi boots. And like you said, it’s gonna be useless until you get all those pieces.
---
That has to be one of the worst analogies I've ever heard lmao.
---
I'm doubting between leveling guides.. Shadowpanther is making a great one (aimed at rogues and maximizing rep gains) also, then there's Joana..  I'll probably follow that guide and download his addon soon.
---
If you dont choose your faction nased on pride and honor, you dont deserve the horde. Roll dwarf
---
In classic you either have a raid group to clear MC / Ony and other raid content or you dont. Participlating in Raids needs a few hours 3-5 per evening, two hours a week. When you have a group like that you can keep up quite ok.
---
No character can kill ony / mc twice per week so the amount of time one sinks into the game, after a certain point
---
However you can get quite a lot of stuff from crafting and other sources aswell, this is where the ones
---
Also the more hardcore guilds will clear mc / ony much sooner and faster, because they bring lots of consumables and stuff... So while you maybe wiping a few days on certain bosses, they will have the content on farm faster.
---
Once on farm status, you can pretty much keep up with raid content if you play 2x4 hours a week to raid
---
You can actually skip the smoking heart it's not bis.
---
yeah melee is super chill ofc, but on contrary to leveling 10th char this is fun. Also if we reach instance lock we go take a piss and drink and go again
---
Of course you can't lose your way up the ranks unless you're talking AV. You literally get zero bonus honor for a full loss on anything but AV. How is that anything near losing your way up ranks?
---
Premades can't avoid each other effectively on xrealm. Which is what we will have. World PvP is more fair is the most fucking insane thing I've ever heard someone say on this forum. Which is impressive.
---
Trump supporters perhaps.
---
What competition is there camping flight points killing anyone green and above? You are stomping randoms into the ground, just not in a BG who are at least level 60... (if its wsg)
---
Still gives rankers a month odd of world pvp then BG's to finish their grind, seems like a good middle ground than have it all 1 way or the other..
---
My desk is pretty big! Okay but will 1080p suffice or will it be noticeably shittier compared to a 1440p?
---
I always enjoyed, throwing up some hots, going bear to interrupt something or kitty to hit a couple things. You can stealth in stealth groups. If you starting playing with people more regularly you can fill any role the group ends up needing in a five man.
---
There was legitimately this post a few weeks back where some dude claimed that phase 1 would take like 18 months, complete lunatic xD
---
Every alliance player that kills me is signing a death sentence for 10 low level alliance players
---
nope there dont destroy spriest
---
I'm running the guild bank, all you have to do is send the mats to the guild bank through the in game mail box, I would login to this system online through a browser, then click a button within the UI, find the user who donated it, find the item they donated, then provide a count and click save.  The rest is automated and will increment the guild bank inventory automatically.  I've been taking with one of our developers where I work and we might even automate this further with an Add-on that can upload it.
---
You do realize professions do not provide stat boosts and intellect does not increase spell power in classic right?
---
No guild worth their salt will let a a first or second thunderfury go to a rogue.
---
what is this nightfall hunter you speak of?
---
Blessings(freedom, protection, sacrifice), cleanse, divine intervention, judgement of wisdom and light are all very supportive abilities that are not tied to healing. I would love to be a roving paldin that switches between healing dps and cleansing depending on the fight but it will probably just be healing for me.
---
This is going to be a sad day, when classic goes life and all the good guilds are filled, especially all the good guilds that raid 2x a week.
---
The harder you FAP, the more effective it is.
---
Rogue and hunter sets are always pretty good. Even if every single piece isn't necessarily BiS, you can still wear the full set and it's totally fine. These two classes are the ones that get the most PvP value out of their PvE gear and so don't have to rank up.
---
All the hybrid tier sets are sub-par or downright unusable in PvP except for healers. Warriors really need PvP gear. Shamans can use some pieces of their tier sets but not all of it.
---
Mage tier sets are alright but they tend to have better non-tier options. Warlock sets are better suited for PvP. Both classes benefit a lot from PvP gear as well but don't have to get it.
---
In AQ40 there's an in-between set called tier 2.5 which is statted for the specs that the normal tier sets aren't suited for. These tend to be popular for PvP because it's the only real set for some of the PvP specs. Elemental shaman, arms warrior, etc. Usually it's not particularly good for healers and the pure DPS classes.
---
I believe you can, it is just a matter GPU being able to handle it … Also, If you are using notebook to connect your monitor, make sure you have DP connection to utilize that 144hz. My best understanding is that HDMI is only capable of 60 hz… correct me if I am wrong.
---
&gt;I don't really consider attacking people who are 15 levels below me as what I think of as PvP.
---
No but its what i would consider a living world and its awesome. I think its great that i can be in this world just minding my business and that people can attack me. Its another threat (a more dynamic threat than just mobs) that you need to consider. Sometimes i hide when i see high level alliance players or i go stealth or if i see multiple allys doing a quest that i also need to do i might just fuck off for now. All this for me adds to immersion and i could never play on a pve server because of it.
---
I'm gonna go feral druid myself, and think it's good for you along the same lines :
---
\- Fairly fast leveler
---
\- Lots of playstyle variety
---
\- Stealth and sit in a corner if you have to leave at short notice
---
\- Not gonna get corpse camped either because of that
---
\- Pre-60 it's easy to get into instances as you can fulfil pretty much any role required.
---
\- Bear leveling can be done semi-afk, I intend to potentially multi-task while auto-attacking as a bear.
---
\- Self-healing means less downtime and no need to gather consumables/food.
---
\- Travel form, so no need to save up/grind for a mount, and saves on lots of "dead time" inbetween quests or mobs.
---
Snackies...? \*shivers\*
---
You'll have to use it in succession I'm afraid :(
---
Exactly this, just play fair yourself and just try to play with other fair minded people and stay away from the leeches.
---
Don't judge
---
ah, so we are pretending AB isn't in the game, are we?
---
people like you are why there is war mode now. "omg, look at all these unwilling participants who knowingly rolled on a pvp server, that is so unfair! "
---
give me a fucking break. and yes, premades will avoid each other on xrealm. you can easily identify a premade by looking at their ranks. if you knew what you were talking about you would know that.
---
Honestly the guild leader was a great dude at first, and the guild ran by guild council and everything went perfectly fine.
---
As soon as that fucker took thunderfury they dropped out the guild and heartstoned. I was really pissed off
---
Yeah, it was added in 1.4 according to wowwiki and gamepedia, so phase 2 for us, but if you level casually you will probably hit 60 around phase 2 drops, since it probably drops in 2-3 months after release. 
---
Anyway yeah, Blackcrow is pretty much the best option, unless you are a dwarf, then go for Willey's Portable Howitzer from strat.
---
But i plan to go for the gun as well, an go for the extra hit from survival talents, Blackcrow has too much competition from rogues and warriors...
---
Mate... There's always at least 1 stealthed rogue in flagroom in every premade. This surprises nobody.
---
in p2 it will be only in wpvp in p3 it's hard to get high without bgs. 7-8 might be possible though.
---
This is why gnome rogue.. ganking cows leaves them so salty they turn into bresaola.
---
I love that they're hated.

"and has a better personality then me"
---
Any videos of this as an example?
---
I wouldnt go over 27" for 1080p.
---
But 5-8 hours a day is a ton.
---
For real, if you bake an awesome WoW themed treats.  I wanna see &amp; eat that shit.
---
Yeah, I admit I'm biased because I don't enjoy world PvP. With no battlegrounds and only 1 raid on a weekly raid timer, I'd get bored pretty fast (or more realistically, have a crapload of alts).
---
This sounds like a good solution to me. Even if you didn't wait on the loot that long, you'd still be able to screw up their timing. 
---
It's ridiculous that such a thing is even necessary though. If I saw someone mining a node, I'd just move on and look for the next one.

# &lt;Forty Decent People&gt; 18+ Competent Raiding | NA Horde PvE 
---
We are an 18+ PvE Horde guild of goal oriented individuals who aim to clear all the PvE content that Classic WoW has to offer, and to have a good time doing it. With the ultimate goal of defeating Kel'Thuzad and C'Thun. Leadership is experienced in raiding and we are currently in the process of recruiting more Officers(**Hunter, Priest, Rogue, Warlock**), Raiders(**application only**), and general members of all skill levels. We are also deciding which server to play on, and the guild tabard design. The server will be decided by vote when we are closer to launch.  
---
All raid times are EST. We plan to raid 2 nights a week so people do not get burned out. If there is high demand for raids outside of these times, or to extend the raid time to midnight, those discussions will be had once phase 4 is on the horizon because clearing MC, Ony, and BWL in two 4 hour raids is quite doable.  
---
Tuesday 7-11PM  
---
Thursday 7-11PM  
---
Loot will be given out by loot council. Primary decision makers are the Class Officers, with other officers and Master Looter serving as oversight to (hopefully) prevent most drama causing decisions from being made.  
---
No single person has ever carried a 40 man raid to victory. You do not need to be an all star to join us. However, you do need to be able to pull your own weight in the raid. If we can assemble 40 people who all pull their own weight, not a single raid boss will stand in our way.  
---
If you aren't looking to raid, but want to be a part of a guild of decent individuals to run dungeons with or just hang out, you can simply join the guild. **You only need to post an application** **if** **you want to raid.**  
---
Please, do not apply if:  
---
\- You cannot respect your fellow raiders, even if they have made a mistake that caused a wipe.  
---
\- Multiple raid wipes make you emotionally unstable or hopeless.  
---
\- You cannot speak on voice coms.  
---
\- You feel like playing for 5 hours 2 times a week is too much of a commitment for you.  
---
Do apply if:  
---
\- You are a relaxed person who's fun to play with.  
---
\- You are willing to make a long-term commitment to take down Kel'Thuzad and C'Thun.  
---
\- You are dedicated to improve and build the raid team with us.  
---
If you read this far, you may be the kind of player we are looking for, if you have questions you can ask them in our Discord, post here, or PM me on discord. The "get-applications-here" channel has instructions on how to apply. Everyone who raids with us applies. Even Shizune the guild leader.

Ok wow. Are you daft? I already said we WILL see plenty of druid tanks. They're legit. I also said we will see plenty of prot pallys 1-58, hardly any at 60, and never in a raid. You're arguing against that for some reason without actually saying anything to back it up. You're literally arguing a mute point without any logic.
---
Classic is going to run on the Legion engine, therefore the original addons are not compatible. Some add-ons were compatible with the beta and past stress tests but not all. The next stress test will be open to anyone with a sub and you can use that to set up your addons for launch.
---
Gotcha. When you watch those cool treat vanilla pvp videos to fun to watch them fight the in the open world but it seems like you'll never be fighting serious competition.
---
might* as well.
---
Am I the only person who found the concept of dedicated level 19 pvp characters really dumb?
---
And I will angrily emote you, jerk!  Take that!
---
If it's your faction, generally whoever kills the mob closest to the node I try to let them have it
---
If it's enemy faction, do whatever you can to dick them over. I play PvE servers, so passive aggressive PvP is the best PvP lol
---
Playing 5-8 hours a day and still not managing to keep up with your friends isn't "playing casually", it's "sucking at the game".
---
Surprise for any hunter that didn't play a hunter vanilla, same with deadzone and leeway
---
But many are malleable children who cannot make their own decisions. Every day its another person who asks people to choose which class he/she should take, what guides to use etc etc.
---
Hunter having to repair has to be the biggest red flag, as a hunter you should be the last one to need repairs and that’s only if u somehow fuck up your feign death.
---
1080p @ 240hz masterrace
---
Paladin 2.5 is literally the best pieces you can have in PvP for deep ret / reckoning specs. And it's not bad for PvE either. I can't check the stats right now but, contrary to T2 I'm sure it has a lot of crit / agi. Just overall a wonderful set for rets.
---
OP should definitely consider this. I love grouping with a good hunter.
---
There are hundreds of posts about this topic already with comments like that, i tried to offer something in depth, which cannot be said about wow forums and reddit posts.
---
This. People seem to think that Warrior/Pally just makes the warrior's health pool endless from heals. 
---
Pally is a hard casting healing class. Outside of bubble, he's not getting a cast off against two competent opponents with interrupts. The warrior would be long dead by the time two mages are out of ways to interrupt the pally.
---
&gt; Having an opinion different from yours is not entitlement.
---
Telling other people they shouldn't comment on your post or assuming that people hate BFA because they played vanilla or are interested in classic (or assuming they're not interested in classic because they hate BFA)... these things are deeply fucking entitled.
---
You literally assumed you knew my feelings about BFA because I'm not willing to play the hyperbole game with cataclysm. because apparently it's all or nothing. One must either love retail and despise classic or love classic and despise retail.
---
I'm not going to play this stupid game. I'm hyped about classic, but retail isn't bad.
---
I'm also going to comment on your thread. If you don't like other people having opinions, then don't fucking post on a public forum.
---
&gt; If someone is the opinion that BFA isn't fun, then by definition playing BFA is not an option.
---
There it is again. I mention that retail isn't that bad, so therefor I must be telling you to play BFA.
---
Nobody told you to play BFA because none of us actually care what you play.
---
Show me on this doll where the Warlock feared you
---
You deserve all of the upvotes. This is amazing.
---
We were a server first guild from late Naxx through most of Uldar.  We had several players even in 25 man raids that saw play mostly because they always showed up.
---
In Vanilla, I was one of those players.  As a druid that tried cat, bear, and moonkin (which all sucked in one way or another) I was also a bad healer.  But my attendance was top notch and druid recruits were rare.
---
man you are so clueless about ranking it really makes me annoyed. REAL rankers ( people who farm a lot and compete on honor ) do NOT sit at FPS EVER. WHY? because it's TOO BAD HONOR PR / HR and they need to compete. There will be MORE PEOPLE SITTING ON FPS WITH BGS. WHY ? BEcause the majority of people are not organized / do not run a good premade and still NEED honor in order to get lower rank like 1-10. This means the ONLY WAY TO GAIN HONOR is to kill LOW LEVELS / GREENS at FPS. WITHOUT BGS there is a CHANCE that the better rankers will come clear out the fps / or you can find other casual rankers to group with to have actual fights. Premade v premade games are very rare and if they take too long most people will rather just not do them because they will be outperformed by people who just throw their games and they wont get their rank ( or it will take way more time where you need to play 10hrs + a day ) how do you not understand this hsit

**&lt;Nemesis&gt;** Horde - NA – PvP – Semi-Hardcore w/ Loot Council
---
Raid Times: Monday, Wednesday at 8pm CST. 
---
**&lt;Nemesis&gt;** is a brand new guild created by long term players who raided into Naxx when Vanilla was live. Lately we’ve been on private servers. We are older now and realize that life sometimes gets in the way of this game we love so much. We can’t play at all times like we used to so we need to make the most of it. What makes Vanilla WoW so special is the journey and the community you enjoy it with. We are building a family and we hope you consider joining us if you’d like to be a part of our team.
---
**&lt;Nemesis&gt;** will be focused on competing with three day guilds while maintaining a two day weekly raid schedule. We are taking a few days off for the initial push to 60. We are currently planning to do Ony/MC exactly one month after launch. We will make the most of our raid times and expect all of our members to be prepared and consistent. We may not exactly be a server first competitive guild for phase 1, but we plan to clear all other phases within the first lockout they are released. As we evolve we will rival most hardcore guilds through later phases while keeping our raid days to a minimum.
---
**&lt;Nemesis&gt;** is recruiting both extremely experienced and newer players who are willing to grow and develop with our team. All members are expected to handle coaching well, and be patient with loot. It comes so slowly in vanilla but it will come. Every person in the raid team will be expected to come with consumables and flasks for progression. We also anticipate having some newer players in the guild so we need patient members who are willing to help guide and assist our newbies.
---
On our off nights we plan to do 20 man raids or PvP. We love both organized battleground teams and world PvP.
---
If you’re interested in joining our team please contact us on discord for more information.
---
Kasualty#3759, Spartda#7299, Stolas#6827
---
The reality is that so far Classic only has 6 content phases planned and once those have rolled out, as far as we know at this point in time, there are no plans for content beyond that.
---
Once the more *hardcore* players hit the content cap they won't be out progressing anyone any more and the rest of us will eventually (maybe...) catch up.
---
Beeing in the exact same boat, what class would you consider less time consuming, but still able to keep up? I was actually considering rogue, because i thought that was more about mastering your class then gear, but i have only druid vanilla experience (and that took a LOT of time)
---
FWIW, pserver meta has a lot of priests specced into PI.
---
**Epoch of Thought \[H\]** | NA-PvP | Wed/Thu/Sun 1800—2200 PST | Hardcore |Point-based Loot Council
---
**TL;DR**:  Hardcore experienced, established guild seeks non-toxic, dedicated, competent raiders for Classic dominance starting with test realm practice &amp; preparation now. We're accepting all great people who are willing to work to be their best.
---
**About**: EoT started on Bloodscalp shortly after vanilla wow’s release &amp; became a top guild on the server. We’ve persisted as a gaming family ever since. Our goal has always been to clear content as a team while providing a second family for our members.  
---
Our leadership is experienced, skilled, and caring.  We've been around since the beginning and we're not quitting until we've farmed Naxx enough to gear everyone :).  We look forward to developing a winning team of people you'd not only want to raid with but would also like to meet in real life if the chance arose.
---
**Raiding plans**: For classic we will be a top guild &amp; clear Naxxramas. We have a solid core experienced through Naxx. Most of us have raided for years &amp; are ready to devour classic content. We are running two competitive raid teams both lead by experienced leadership and tanked by experienced main tanks.  
---
**Raid Schedule**: Wed/Thu/Sun, 6 PM to 10 PM PST (GMT-8) (9pm – 1 AM EST) hard stops and early nights where possible. Our guild has always been extremely active &amp; 20-mans, Onyxia, etc. will continue to be ran on non-core days. On most days, if you log in, you will find a good group of people to smash content with.
---
**Loot System**:  We run a unique/proprietary point-guided loot council (attendance and contributions are measured and accounted for but there is no bidding and the system is designed to be transparent and efficient).  The loot council is focused on awarding gear where it best serves raid progression &amp; best recognizes attendance, &amp; contribution to raid performance.
---
**What we expect**: We expect dedicated, skilled raiders who show up with consumes, proper gear, &amp; knowledge. We expect competence and literacy with computers, google spread sheets, balancing individual schedules, and team communication.  We expect effort during, before, and after raids.  We expect serious practice on a guild hosted test server.  
---
We are team-focused so great performers are appreciated &amp; recognized, but divas who are unconcerned with the health of the entire raid team or overly self-interested are not tolerated. We are a diverse group of raiders worthy of individual respect &amp; the respect of everyone’s time.  Toxicity and drama stirring have no place in our guild.
---
**In short, be prepared, be knowledgeable, be on time, &amp; don’t be an A-hole.**
---
**Why We Will Survive and Thrive**:  We are experienced, dedicated, and prepared.  Our leadership team consists of mature, experienced, and professional leaders.  Our raid core consists of experienced, skilled, and most importantly, dedicated raiders.  
---
We are busy doing all the prep work we need to run a highly organized, reasonably competitive guild.  We are inclusive, non-toxic, and value team building and a rewarding social environment over pyrrhic victories.  We were successful in actual vanilla and have only gotten smarter, wiser, and more organized with age.
---
**Most importantly we desire complete decimation of classic content and will not stop until we get there.**
---
**Looking for**: We are specifically seeking: top tier Mages &amp; a Rogue class lead, but great people of all classes are strongly encouraged to apply.  Core raid spots are earned through demonstrated competence &amp; dedication. This means that no core spots will be predetermined and certainly not before anyone's hit 60.
---
If you are interested in leadership roles within Epoch please send let us know and we’ll chat.
---
**Current Activity**:  The guild is practicing on our own test server to get the group reoriented to the old content and shaking the rust off.  We use the test raids for providing feedback, polishing raid skills, and determining and bolstering roster weakness.  
---
Currently, a sizeable portion of the guild is practicing leveling runs on pservers while a few are raiding hardcore.  We also have guild Jackbox party nights for fun while we wait for classic.
---
**Apply**: The best way to join is to shoot our Recruitment Officer Narphie#8585, or our Guildmaster a private discord message **(Discord: Lne#2710 | Battlenet: Lne#1326)**.  You can also hit up our assistant GM on **discord:  XvK#7740**

There's nothing wrong with asserting your dominance. They better emote spam the shit out of /bow /salute when they see you.
---
Ez and cheap
---
I'm interested as well
---
Oh I caught up to them. What I intended to get across is that there are always people who are more hardcore, and that life at 60 wasnt always filled with busy work, which gives the slower folks or the folks who started late a good chance to catch up.
---
I'm not a priest player but a chest with 73 healing will be bis for quite a while, just make the chest and then abandon tailoring lul
---
&gt; Furry warris
---
Why are you singling out Tauren? ^^/s
---
Thanks for the reply dude!
---
I’m looking at the AOC CQ32G1 1440p. 
---
Couldn’t seem to find the FreeSync compatibility chart.. do you know if this monitor is compatible with g sync?
---
Warlock any spec. You are a true support class in all environments.
---
May* as well.
---
Much less time required to get pvp-BiS at level 19 than at 60.
---
These people also like being gods in their BG, when they go against a non-twink it just doesn't matter what class the other person is. I played level 39 twink in vanilla, and when you got two twink teams against each other in BGs it was actually pretty fun.
---
27" is where it's at dawg
---
Has this been on a private server? Probably bugged.
---
Last day of the week or first day of the week doesn't matter; if you're at the top of the list and something drops that you want, then you get it and drop to the bottom.
---
If its the last boss of the week, then whoever is at the top of the list is either there because they rolled high and passed on everything all week, in which case they ought to get something, or because they rolled low and everyone above them got something that week already, in which case it's their turn.
---
I like how there are reputation meters to all kind of NPC factions, but when it comes to the repupation towards other players you cant simply tell who is a d\*ck or actually a good guy. But then... In a real life it works the same way right (friends stabbing each other backs on every corner)
---
In case of a classic success, maybe we could get different approach from developers this time? Would be nice to actually support the idea of multiplayer game and playing with others rather than creating singleplayer mmorpg (aka retail)...
---
Nobody is going to fight over a bm hunter lol
---
Because one shotting level 11's is fun.
---
Ive been playing games as my main hobby since the sega genesis. However, I guess I take for granted that not everyone plays games a few hours a day. It should be noted that I never put more time into a single game like I did with wow, its just the nature of the beast.
---
Best thing for you to learn to be a good hunter is sit back and pay attention to your surroundings, lay down traps just in case something’s goes down before pulls, learn to wing clip and kite, learn to peel for your healer if the tank fails you can deal with most any mob and get away alive, make sure you don’t break cc with multi shot, know when to have growl on, know when to dismiss pet to jump down ledges so you don’t pull entire instance, learn the art of f/d trap.
---
Yeah, but newbs might think they should or have to because it is so much focus on guides on this reddit. 
---
He is just saying that it is not necessary to use them to have fun.. it might be even more fun without.
---
&gt; Im an adult who works 10 hours a day minus weekends and I can still put in 6-7hrs a day on the weekdays and 15 on weekends, there’s no excuse for 2 hours a week
---
So you sleep 5 hours a night and still only have 1-2 hours to eat, drink, commute, play with your kids, spend time with your spouse, cook, clean, do yardwork, clear snow, visit family, etc
---
Sounds like nonsense to me.
---
Yep. This isn't like current WoW where gear resets every 4 months and Titanforging will keep you pretty close to top end raiders.
---
im guessing a hunter that melees the boss to proc nightfall on him? I can't imagine why you'd want a hunter doing this over literally any actual melee though, unless you have literally no other hunters and will need tranq shot or w/e at some point
---
Upvoted on 5 accounts fuck reddit cringelords we dont give a shit if you made a warglaive out of construction paper and glued it to your dog
---
Just one note: You mention class homogenization starting. I disagree heavily.
---
Every single class was unique in Vanilla, but you couldn't play a good bunch of specs outside of maybe PVP and even then you're better off playing a different spec than balance druid e.g.
---
TBC just gave every single spec something that made them actually decent. They didn't give Shamans CC for example; They just gave Elemental and Enhancement ways to not go OOM after clicking one of the buttons in their UI by accident. (Overexaggerating I know.)
---
It also gave several classes an actual rotation/spell priority to play around with. Having warlocks be these DoT Pet casters who're supposed to never use their DoTs is silly IMO, and I'm not a fan of how the 8 debuff limit was a thing for so long and also not a fan of DS being so powerful that spamming shadowbolt became the defacto playstyle for TBC warlocks later on either.
---
TBC Class design was great. Classes recieved logical additions for the most part (except warriors. Hey, let's nerf rage so that you can spec into getting more rage again to neutralize that... What the?) and I for one would love most things from Classic to stay as they are but have TBC's class and also encounter design bleed into Classic.
---
Dungeons from 15 to 50 barely offer any mechanics, classes have all these cool situational abilities which they keep in TBC but they actually get to use some of them more often, hybrids fully embrace their support-but-also-okay-ish-DPS role which I really like, it had its upsides.
---
Not a fan of flying, the smaller world, dailies (and arena, crucify me, I enjoy objective based PVP, not deathmatch) and the like though. 100% with you there. I'd love to see a Classic+ as well, but I'll definetly also enjoy a TBC Classic. It's the only expansion to WOW that feels like they tried to fix actual problems with the game but misstepped into a few directions, whereas every other expansion fixed problems that people only realized they had when they were "fixed". Screw Crossrealm functionality, LFG, LFR.
---
&gt;Also, Warriors received heroic leap in Cata and victory rush in Wotlk. TBC gave them close to nothing new, to be honest, except for Devastation which is sunder Armor 2: Electric boogaloo. Woohoo.
---
You're right that Heroic Leap was added in Cata (originally in some Wotlk alpha/beta builds) but Victory Rush was absolutely added with TBC. They also gained Intervene and Spell Reflect which were hugely useful in PvP. Commanding Shout was the only underwhelming ability they got but it certainly wasn't bad.
---
Idk about druid.
---
All tier sets are sick for PvP for both Hunter and Warlock. Warlocks don't use Tier 1 in PvP and Tier 2 items are replaced with +hit.
---
I know this is meant to be a joke but I honestly don‘t get it
---
once you hit 60 and get some of your pre-raid gear you dont need to spend that much time in the game outside of having fun (eg your raids and BGs).  if you want to min-max more with consumables and world buffs it takes a bit more time cos u need gold and to run dungeons etc more but in a casual guild it's not gonna break your game
---
the main thing with playing casual hours is that it takes a lot longer to get to 60 so (a) you are a little behind on content and gear relative to others, and (b) there will be less people gearing up in 5 mans so its not quite as easy to get a group - especially as a rogue
---
but you should be fine
---
Would anyone be interested in forming a raid guild where we distribute loot using a cryptocurrency (say ERC20 token) that I can create with very specific distribution rules? It would require members to be tech-savvy and know how to use blockchain, but then it would allow members to trade with each-other if they so chose.
---
Most of the tier sets 1,2 and 3 are all about PvE. Tier 2.5 and ZG usually are geared towards PvP.
---
Exception out the top of my head would be paladin T2  which is a half baked holy retri set.
---
Meh.
---
If you're not planning on keeping it, I'd probably just go with the 2nd/3rd BiS option like this: https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=13346
---
Yes. 99% of priests will max tailoring at lvl 60 for this item, craft it, then drop tailoring and lick up whatever else they wanted (can still wear it)
---
You'll certainly want to do the same, 100% worth.
---
Impossibly hard.
---
I was in a hardcore guild that had BWL on farm and did AQ40 when it came out. 3 weeks and it burned me out with the requirements for it's raid-members.
---
I went back to raiding MC and ZG with other casuals. Didn't even get back into BWL or AQ20 before Burning Crusade came out.
---
But in Classic it might be different. The content is supposed to stay. So maybe even casuals might eventually catch up.
---
&gt;Hard not to see this video and think that if people put time into working out routes and pulls they will easily beat the solo questers to lvl 60.
---
I'm not sure how he is assuming anything close to what you said.
---
You have blessings mainly, not only the long term ones, but also the sohrt term ones (freedom is mostly a pvp thing, protection is great, when a dps draws aggro, sacrifice can help mitigate dmg spikes).
---
The other main bonus are jdugements, you can put light (heals people, who attack the mob) or wisdom (restores mana for people who attack the mob) on the mob and keep it going while autoattacking.
---
Then there also your many auras. You can cleanse all debuff types but curses, you have a big oh crap button with lay on hands and you can do all that while using nightfall to further support oyur raid.
---
If you choose to do this in healer gear, you'll further reduce your dps, but can also adequatly heal when necessary.
---
"will a player who plays 1-2 hours a day be at the same level as the players who play 8-10 hours a day?"
---
-op
---
our guild did 3 hour raids and once time was up i was called, i think only people in more hardcore guilds would push for more than 3 hours
---
Can easy find another warrior and start group for ubrs and reserve dalrends if he tanks
---
Please stop watching guides and tutorials for everything.
---
I don’t believe so. Whenever Neverwinter came out on Xbox back in the day I did a lot of research on the game before hand. Going into a game blindly can be fun. But I don’t really like to waste time. I like to prepare ahead of time and kind of know a little bit of what I’m doing whenever I jump into the game. But like someone said in another comment everyone chooses their own way of playing. I prefer not wasting time and being the best I possibly can from the get go.
---
Devilsaur farming PVP can be pretty competitive for example.
---
Wtf. Mage warlock tier1-2 are shit for pve for example.
---
pally: T1, T2, T2.5, T3
---
lock: T1, T2, T2.5, T3
---
hunter: T1, T2, T2.5, T3
---
priest: T1, T2, T2.5, T3
---
druid: T1, T2, T2.5, T3
---
rogue: T1, T2, T2.5, T3
---
mage: T1, T2, T2.5, T3
---
shaman: T1, T2, T2.5, T3
---
warrior: T2.5
---
hunter T sets are insane. lock T sets are even better than PvP sets depending on the situation. they lack a bit stamina, but make up for it through the setbonuses. the pet resistances are huge.  
---
druid is okay. its not special. the blue PvP set may be the better choice up to T2.5.
---
Thanks so much for this reply. You’re probably right and I am overthinking it - I’ll just play sub rogue and make it work. See you in Classic!
---
Have a look [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ej9mOe5NamLldpfyFfXrqvLMZP-aG2Zi1su7QzPRNJY/edit#gid=0). Not sure about your model, you might want to do some googling before hitting that purchase button. Good luck man and see you in Azeroth :\]
---
You meant “Fury Warriors”.  “Fury” means rage or anger.  “Furry” means “covered in fur”, like a Tauren or Worgen.
---
I dont think you can drop tailoring and keep wearing it.
---
I think it has a tailoring 300 requirement (like a level or class requirement). Youd have to wait till you've replaced it to drop tailoring
---
Sure but I know  fury warriors dont have a set and I saw locks set isn't great. Are most of them actually good is a better question
---
Last I heard there is still no official Blizzard documentation for the ingame WoW lua API. You will need to dig around the wow interface code to find the relavent functions to call.
---
Some of the relevant functions are
---
[GetGuildBankItemInfo(tab,slot)](https://wow.gamepedia.com/API_GetGuildBankItemInfo)  
---
[GetGuildBankItemLink(tab,slot)](https://wow.gamepedia.com/API_GetGuildBankItemLink)
---
For advanced parsing such as items with random stats (ie item of the whale) you will need to be able to parse the ItemLink
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/ItemLink
---
You can also use tooltip scanning to retrieve item information
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/UIOBJECT_GameTooltip#Hidden_tooltip_for_scanning
---
Here is a dump of the Blizzard lua code for the guild bank UI https://www.townlong-yak.com/framexml/27101/Blizzard_GuildBankUI/Blizzard_GuildBankUI.lua
---
Here is a very simple script I threw together. It will build a list of item names and the total amount in the guild bank. The code compiles, but I don't have WoW installed to test if it does anything useful or throws errors. Perhaps you can use it to get started with a lua data exporter tool.
---
    --Build a table of all the items in the guild bank and the total item count
---
    local itemTable = {}
---
    for bankTab = 1, GetNumGuildBankTabs() do
---
    	for slot=1, MAX_GUILDBANK_SLOTS_PER_TAB do
---
    		local texture, itemCount, locked, isFiltered, quality = GetGuildBankItemInfo(tab, slot)
---
    		if itemCount &gt; 0 then
---
    			local itemLink = GetGuildBankItemLink(bankTab, slot)
---
    			--lua regex to parse item links. might not work in classic. see https://wow.gamepedia.com/ItemLink
---
    			local _, _, Color, Ltype, Id, Enchant, Gem1, Gem2, Gem3, Gem4, Suffix, Unique, LinkLvl, reforging, Name = string.find(itemLink, "|?c?f?f?(%x*)|?H?([^:]*):?(%d+):?(%d*):?(%d*):?(%d*):?(%d*):?(%d*):?(%-?%d*):?(%-?%d*):?(%d*):?(%d*)|?h?%[?([^%[%]]*)%]?|?h?|?r?")			
---
    			if Id then --make sure we didnt get nill from the regex
---
    				if itemTable[Id] then --add to existing count
---
    					itemTable[Id] = itemTable[Id] + itemCount
---
    				else --store the item count by the item id
---
    					itemTable[Id] = itemCount
---
    				end
---
    			end
---
    		end	
---
    	end
---
    end
---
    --Make the edit box so you can copy the string
---
    local editBox = BankDumpEditBox or CreateFrame("EditBox", "BankDumpEditBox", UIParent)

    editBox:Show()

---
Yeah, but once you log and you realize how painful the leveling is. lol  
---
At the time, I was OK with it because I didn't play much other games. And I was like "ok, I guess the pain is mandatory and part of the fun."  
---
But now, with all the prior experience kids have in games, they will just be bored / SO FRUSTRATED (it is frustrating when you're young and "not so good" to level).  
---
We'll see, but I wouldn't count on them making a significative part of the player base.
---
Hence the "most".

31/00/20 priest.
---
It's the most "support" focused priest spec, some guilds bring one of them. It's actually more efficient than having a shadow priest, but most people find this spec boring.
---
Your job will be to apply shadow weaving to the enemy so your Warlocks deal more damage, and refresh it every few seconds.
---
You will also use Power Infusion on the best mage.
---
Your heals will be weaker and slower, so you'll likely end up focusing on dispels, shields and refreshing shadow weaving with r1 mind blast. You'll still heal when needed of course.
---
&gt; I wonder this because I'm considering of playing a feral druid, which have been shown to be good tanks in certain scenarios/raids/bossfights or dungeons, and decent DPS with the right gear and tactics.
---
The best advice is this: Roll a class that's actually good at the role you want to fill. Playing a "sub-optimal" spec requires a lot more grinding and minmaxing than a class+spec that fills that role better. 
---
Roll feral for DPS if you *really*, *really* want the reality is that you get loot prio and you'll just perform worse with more effort. 
---
The people who say the opposite frankly don't know what they're talking about. Sorry.
---
Oh in that case I'm sorry, I didn't get the fact that you did reach your friends in the end. Then I completely agree :)
---
T2.5 is the best offensive set for paladins, yes. Nothing comes close it (well, for spelladin, t2 is nearly equal). It'S the absolute king for both pve and pvp.
---
I wouldn'T say T2 is not very valuable. It's very good for holy reck or a more offensively oriented holy pvp build. If you refuse to wear less than plate, it's also quite good for healers. And for the spelladin spec, t2 is excellent.
---
Just check out the spinny attack animation on the dwarf. That ought to sort you out.
---
[Furry (two rs) refers to being covered in fur](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/furry), like a cow.
---
Clearly you meant to type ["Fury"](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/fury) which is the Warrior spec
---
I'm guessing English isn't your first language though. You used "und" instead of "and", so I'm assuming your first language is German? 
---
Plenty of native English speakers make that kind of mistake all the time too, though.
---
Take as long as possible. There is no need to rush.
---
Tbh that survey is from reddit which isnt the greatest demographic. If rp-pvp was truly that popular it would show on retail.
---
Yes. T2 mage is crap for pve.
---
Obviously but i wouldnt call putting my kids over WoW a difficult pill to swallow. Thats a shocking statement to make in all honesty.
---
Hahaha oh you are right. Dear taurens: I love you I meant fury not furry. You look fabulous 😘
---
Maybe I can use this thread for my question as well.
---
I’ve got a GTX970 gpu and I’m thinking about buying a 1440p monitor. Will I have a good time with Classic in this setup?
---
Or is it just not worth it upgrading to a 4K monitor when I just want to enjoy Classic? Not going to play other games in the near future...
---
It does not require tailoring to wear it. It's just a bind on pickup item.

#####Newly formed guild recruiting players of all skill levels interested in a casual raiding experience and having friendly people to play Classic with.
---
***
---
&amp;nbsp;    
---
**&lt;The Winged Expanse&gt;** is a North American based casual raiding guild occupying *Server-TBD*. As a guild, we look to maintain a focus on understanding and supporting your guild mates as we all traverse Classic raiding together.&amp;nbsp;    
---
A lot of us are experiencing vanilla World of Warcraft for the first time and want to see what the raiding scene was like back in 2004, without [Dives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtvIYRrgZ04) hounding us for moar dots. We're not looking to be server first, but we are here to make progress (and friends!).&amp;nbsp;    
---
If this type of raiding experience sounds like something you might be interested in, we have some more information below, as well as a link to our [website](https://www.guilded.gg/The-Winged-Expanse) and [application](https://www.guilded.gg/r/EnDRnPgowE?i=R405lvVd). Thanks!&amp;nbsp;    
---
#🔎 What we look for in members 🔎
---
* Mature individuals who are willing to be kind and understanding of each other in order to create a comfortable guild environment.&amp;nbsp;    
---
* Players who are looking to clear raid content, but don't want to push themselves for server first.&amp;nbsp;    
---
* Social members who are ready to hang out and run some dungeons or chill out on the Minecraft server. We want Classic to be what we all have in common, but make friends for other games here too!&amp;nbsp;    
---
* Members that will be proud to be a part of **&lt;The Winged Expanse&gt;** and care about the reputation of the guild they belong to.&amp;nbsp;    
---
#📜 Requirements and Rules 📜
---
* You are required to listen in on Discord during raid time. We also ask that you have a functioning microphone and that you either use a well configured noise gate or use Push-to-Talk instead.&amp;nbsp;    
---
* Show up to raid with a good attitude. This includes patience for newer vanilla players and a strong willingness to learn!&amp;nbsp;    
---
* Be kind to those around you, both in and out of the guild. We care about our reputation as a guild, and we expect you to as well!&amp;nbsp;    
---
#📅 Guild Events 📅
---
**Pre-Launch:** For those of you that are looking to make friends before launch, be sure to stop by the Discord and say hello! We're all here to make friends and play some games at the end of the day. Wouldn't it be cool to start Classic with some buddies?&amp;nbsp;    
---
**Launch:** On launch day, be sure to show up and enjoy the launch with everyone! Make groups for leveling, introduce yourself if you haven't already, and have fun! We'll be attempting to create the guild within a few hours after launch.&amp;nbsp;    
---
**Post Launch:** Immediately after the game launches, we're all just trying to have fun and hit level 60 together. The plans for raiding are laid out down below. More specific information will be available closer to our first raid night.
---
#⚔️ [Raiding](https://www.guilded.gg/The-Winged-Expanse/games/WowClassic/docs/1569043501) ⚔️
---
**Raid nights are every Tuesday and Thursday, 8:00pm - 11:00pm Central Standard Time (CST).**&amp;nbsp;    
---
Raiding begins November 26th. Members are expected to have reached level 60, acquired adequate raiding gear, completed the required attunement, and be versed in raid mechanics by this time. This gives members three months to enjoy the content before you have to be raid ready.&amp;nbsp;    
---
We don't expect everyone to have perfect attendance; Life comes first. That being said, we really appreciate a heads up when possible, and we do expect you to be present more often than not both physically and mentally.&amp;nbsp;    
---
**We're looking for people to play roles, not classes! Play whatever class you believe you will have the most fun playing! Roles are first come, first serve as we establish the guild.**&amp;nbsp;    
---
For raid composition, we're aiming for a Main Tank, an Offensive Tank, 2 Alternate Tanks, 8 Healers, 15 Melee Damage, and 15 Ranged Damage. Roles will be assigned as you join the guild so that we know what we are looking for as we continue to recruit.&amp;nbsp;    
---
The loot system is a rotating loot council. The goal of the item distribution is to do what is most beneficial for the guild, but keep it transparent and fair for all guild members.
---
That about sums it up! Below is a link to our website and application, again. If you have any questions, feel free to reply to this post, message me, or find me on Discord at **Marotheit#7401**. We hope to see you soon!&amp;nbsp;

**Our Application:** https://www.guilded.gg/r/EnDRnPgowE?i=R405lvVd
---
Yep my native language is german thats true and the „und“ looks rly strange
---
Yeah, can be great for RP or WPvP though, have one guy as bait or in a parley with +10 friends just standing around a couple of feet away and all appear at once, good times.
---
You would be better off farming gold at level 60 and buying mats than you would be following this strategy. It isn't as pricey as people think maybe 200g at most.
---
Any higher rank will require bg farming. Kills have diminishing returns so they aren’t great
---
Tier 1s are not great, but without Dire Maul they will probably see play. Tier 2 are just great for most classes. Warrior one is always tanking tho, so if you are into DPS you will have to dress elsewhere.
---
You won't. They'll be in full pre raid BiS, enchanted and g2g before you get your first mount. They'll have MC on farm by the time you're starting to farm your pre raid BiS. That's fine. Don't let it bother you. You'll eventually hit 60, eventually have your ore raid BiS, and will eventually be farming MC yourself. And you'll have a blast along the way.
---
It does not require 300 tailoring to wear, only to craft.

**Real Men of Genius**
---
**Horde // NA-PvP // Loot Council**
---
**Raid times**: 9:30p-12:30a CST Tues, Wed, Thurs
---
**About**: RMoG has experienced leadership intent on building a strong, cohesive community that clears content efficiently. We're building the guild with the long term in mind, when it comes to both content and building a community. Most would consider us a semi-hardcore guild. We don't care about server firsts, but we do care about holding raiders to high expectations and not letting dead weight drag us down. 
---
**Goals**:
---
\- clear all content quickly with solid raid performance
---
\- avoid and/or stamp out intraguild drama
---
\- fair, transparent loot distribution &amp; guild bank management
---
\- encourage activity and engagement within the guild as opposed to raidlogging
---
\- establish dominance in world pvp
---
\- 1st MC will be 4 weeks post-launch
---
**Recruitment**: We're currently accepting applications for exceptional players of any class. 
---
**Apply**: You can apply to the guild via this link, which is also available on our Discord server: &lt;[https://forms.gle/DCNNXWeGYqFTofMdA](https://forms.gle/DCNNXWeGYqFTofMdA)\&gt;

Fucking do it. Been a Hordie for life since Vanilla. Leveled a Dwarf Prot Pally on a Pserver and LOVED it. If I were going to play Alliance in Classic it's 100% what I'd do. Just make sure you enjoy healing, if you plan on raiding. (Prot is very good for leveling, and tanking 5 mans while leveling is fun and easy enough, but I was looking forward to healing/Holy @ 60). Gnna go with Troll Priest come Classic though.
---
If the decision is between keeping tailoring and first aid in line with your level, I would say first aid is more impactful. The biggest part of tailoring will be the Robe of the Archmage at 60 rather than making things along the way. Plus cloth farming will be much easier at 60 than while leveling. 
---
Having bandages to heal during combat with frost nova -&gt; bandage will be more of a lifesaver.
---
Back? I'd have to play it first before I could go back. I only play vanilla.
---
I never downvote.
---
6 piece shadow craft over devilsaur...????
---
Your gear gives 3% hit and 5% from talents. You're still missing 1% hit. Also starter daggers are the same for preraid?  This is wrong. Change a few things and this will be a good guide.

---
then you should be a funny bunny and post cringe posts on reddit then copy pasta them to the guild discord! omg it works like a charm!
---
Not sure why idiots downvote you, a green level 58 or 60 dagger is a lot better than barman's Shanker
---
I meant the name. The name never caught on. The community had already dubbed the sets 'tier 0', and just never adopted the official name.
---
&gt; A feral tank can do most of BWL fine,
---
The point was, MC has gear for warriors, basically nothing for feral. BWL has a TON of gear for warrior, once again not much for a druid.
---
AQ20/40 has a bunch of gear for Ferals (and statted for Feral!)
---
But yes high end guilds are probably going to want 1 feral offtank, but be prepared to heal many fights.
---
It's great fun to take on 2-4 player groups though if you are like 10-12 levels higher, it's like a mini-boss for them.
---
Then you’re fine

#**&lt;Reforged&gt;** Alliance **|** NA-PvP **|** Hardcore
---
**INTRODUCTION**
---
Reforged is a guild built specifically for WoW Classic with leadership experience including world-first raiding, Naxx/KT completion pre-TBC, multiple gladiator titles, Hero of the Horde RBG shot-calling, and GM/Raid Leader experience since 2005.  We are a PvE-focused progression guild with a solid current roster.  As recruitment continues, we will ensure new recruits fit in well with our group and our goals.  We expect all members and applicants to clearly and consistently put forth effort to be as knowledgeable as possible on their class, BiS, plans for leveling, etc.  As set forth in our mission statement, we want to build a thriving community of positive, mature, and skilled players while maintaining a lean roster, so make yourself competitive!
---
**GOALS**

As people already mentioned, of course you can't keep up. If you play more then obviously you can achieve more. If you won't play much and someone completely no life, then he *will* get ahead of you.
---
This is actually one of the beauties of Classic if you ask me. In modern WoW it is easy to keep up. Often there are gear resets and there are many catch up mechanics. Not saying this is bad, but it is definitely a different game style.
---
The reason I think this is a great spect of Classic is because it means everyone won't be the heroes. A big part of an MMORPG is that people are different. This allows people to become "famous" on a realm. The guy playing 12 hours each day will be ahead of you, but you might see him in Stormwind wearing his glorious full tier set it will feel cool, because you know how much it means. If everyone can keep up, then gear lose their meaning.
---
The thing is, you won't be alone. The vast majority will be like you and the few will be those amazingly geared people. You can try to be known for something else. Maybe you are extremely generous doing enchant things near free all the time to everyone who needs. Maybe you have a knack for PvP and decide to spend most of your time ganking in one specific zone. Maybe you talk with everyone and are super likeable. Point is, Classic allows people to earn their reputation and achievements based on what they do. If you can't play all day every day this rules out some things, but that is also what makes it worthwhile for those with a lot of time on their hands. You might honestly not be famous for anything - not everyone can be, but even so it means you live in a world that feels *real.* A real world *have* famous people and differences in strength, skill and wealth. Don't dismiss it because you might "only" be average Joe, instead figure what you *can* do and enjoy with the time you have available.
---
Yup. Very much worth the hassle of leveling tailoring to 300, crafting, then dropping it (if you wanted to).
---
Not sure why I was downvoted lol..
---
Hunters actually have the best uptime with least dps lost. Can still back off to tranq.
---
Only downside is going from most interesting rotation to least
---

I can *hear* the German accent in this post.
---
**US, PvP, Alliance or Horde, EST**
---
I played vanilla for a few months on a private server as a dwarf priest and had fun until getting massacred by horde in STV.
---
Looking for a guild with people to group up with to level with, quest, and do dungeons. I want to play on a PvP server, but want to try to find some safety in numbers.
---
Eventually I would be interested in raiding and endgame PvP content, but I have a young baby and full-time career so I will not be able to grind. I will be available to play most nights between 7PM and 10PM EST.
---
No strong preference for alliance or horde. I enjoyed playing priest, but would be open to trying something different.
---
Thanks, hadn't seen that before. Link to the original thread for info: [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/by0y03/want\_to\_avoid\_streamers\_in\_classic\_i\_created\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/by0y03/want_to_avoid_streamers_in_classic_i_created_a/)
---
Near the end of vanilla there were regular MC pugs that I was joining.
---
Can't ask that. Mods ban for that kinda stuff without impunity.
---
I mean... the game isn't even out yet... what are people supposed to post?    
---
More "what class should I play?" "What's the fastest way to lvl" posts?     
---
There will automatically be way more content when the game goes live.
---
If you have the time and money to get a shadow resist gear go for it.
---
It has niche use like duel or in Wpvp when you engage.
---
I would say R7 is possible with world but a ton of time. R10+ absolutely takes bgs once they are out
---
Of course but then people were also AQ geared. It's not a big deal for healers that druid tanks take so much more dmg when they have AQ or maybe even Naxx gear.
---
The animation can be wrong timed (at least in the 1.12 client). I always went with the sound before I had the addon. Even with the addon, I often don't even look at it.
---
With off gear you get like 2% hit before bloodvine, in bracers and boots. Where do you find the rest in the main armor slots?
---
If that's what it takes to get banned then maybe this isn't a sub for me
---
If I see someone waiting for me to aggro I'll wait too, hope you don't mind a stalemate lol
---
Fairly sure T2.5 was shit for hunters. Or at least that's my memory from back then (+SP on it).
---
retail is 100% different than vanilla. that's not an exaggeration, it will feel like you are playing a different game. Vanilla paladins have nothing in common with retail except for the basic fundamental foundation of the class. Ret can't pvp, yes paladins are hard to kill but both factions face their own struggles. Anything you experienced in retail won't feel the same in vanilla.
---
It is worth it. Truevest are WAY better than Exalted Robes, not even close.
---
10-20h/week might work if you plan to be offtank, or fury dps and only do 5mans/UBRS/MC/ZG. Anything beyond MC probably wont work.
---
An important thing to understand is that warrior is **the least** casual class in vanilla. It requires **ALOT** of time and effort.
---
That's probably the best way to put it.
---
I get a feeling that everyone who recommends feral for tanking have just seen that Skarm video and they didn't catch the point where he explains just how much effort it takes to be a feral tank that doesn't suck.
---
But in PVP nothing can stop you? What about polymorph?
---
Lunderfury
---
I'm not believing anyone. I played in Vanilla, my guild cleared through MC and BWL. When I beta tested TBC the first thing I told my guild was Outland gear is amazing.
---
I recently leveled a character on a TBC private server and at level 58 when I headed to outlands I was wearing all kinds of old gear. I had the staff from SM still. By the time I left Hellfire Peninsula quest rewards had replaced all my gear except gloves. That is an abrupt and drastic change to not just itemization, but the way gear is handed out. I was level 62 and had like 3 different pairs of blue pants suddenly.
---
For MT yes, you are correct.
---
Oh yeah totally right.
---
Who has time to say dungeon set 1 - 2 when we can call it tier 0 and. 5
---
This is classic, if someone fucks you over you will remember them and you will see them again, though with layering I'm not so sure anymore..
---
Ret paladin is a buff bot
---
&gt; I guess the question is how many people will care about the meta, or care about tanking a 40 man
---
People will start taking it seriously when they're still wiping on Ragnaros for the 5th week in a row.
---
Warlock don’t use tier up til 2.5 for PvE and they use a mash of it and Bloodvine. Mage don’t use tier 1, 2 or 3 as Bloodvine is best for PvE. DPS Warrior don’t use any tier. Holy Paladins don’t use any tier.
---
&gt;And there won't be people sporting half greens doing it
---
To be fair, casters want a number of greens for the spell power since we don't have dire maul or pvp gear yet that are the blue items with spell power.  And those items which are 5% drop off a rare spawn in the back of a 3hr dungeon crawl is a pretty slim chance to ever see.  Nonetheless beat the other casters to win the upgrade for "pre-raid BiS."
---
Even then, all the dots applied pre trinket would still tick on the player, and Warlocks have shadow dmg mitigation for anything thrown back.
---
&gt; They never caught on due to the herculean effort required of hours upon hours of dungeoning places like LBRS. The upgraded .5 set was a step in the right direction but on the whole not worth the few good pieces for time money and effort.
---
This is exactly why I love them. The herculean effort. I won't have time for raids in Classic so 5-man dungeons is my end game. Dungeon Set 2 is my ultimate goal. Of the many goals I have for Classic, this one is the pinnacle.
---
My buddy messages me multiple times per day about our 'plans' for classic and debating our class synergy to optimal leveling, dungeon runs, etc.
---
I keep having to remind him that we both have wives, kids and jobs and that right now in retail we're both logged in at the same time less than 1hr per week.
---
He can make all the plans he wants, shit ain't happening.
---
Ahh, no doubt.
---
I remember seeing those "monster guilds" that invite basically anybody having like ~100 people online, and end up having to do some sort of draft system to decide who gets to go and who gets benched. Or they do some "A team" and "B team" system.
---
But either way the people who get benched or put on B team (that never clears as much, or as fast, if anything) usually end up pretty pissed and don't stay that long.
---
I mean I got banned for [this](https://i.imgur.com/V2Sbhch.png)
---
Very, very unlikely. That software represents hundreds of thousands of man-hours of investment. Similar products might well have user license fees in the four-figures per user per year range.
---
First come first serve. If someone is there first. Move along. Imo
---
yeah but they could easily have added dwarf shamans and undead paladins in classic already. i mean it's a nice flavor to have faction specific classes but lorewise it wouldve been possible.
---
i still dont miss alliance shamans and horde paladins tho
---
This is big.
---
There was an addon called VanasKoS that will hopefully be remade for Classic - you could record the name of every ganker you saw while levelling. At 60 you could then run around killing any names that flashed up on it without any guilt (and continue to use it to track gankers).
---
Is that in raids? Because once it got into raid content, there were some pretty significant issues with incoming raid damage on many encounters. All ours on Horde side were Holy for that reason pretty much. The odd time someone would spec Disc for like Kazzak. Mages usually got their boosts from trinkets and such.
---
&gt;Genuinely curious how does it create community?
---
Because you actually appreciate the people you play with. That warlock you quested with in the past and put on your friendlist? You will appreciate him or her infinitely more without Summoning stones. 
---
&gt; Having to wait on people could even be detrimental as you get fed up with them wasting your time. 
---
Then an MMO is not for you. It's as simple as that. If your own personal progression  is more important than connecting with other people and making stories together then go play Skyrim or something.
---
Yeah but the difference is that those people are actively seeking out information with which to base their decisions on.  
---
OP is suggesting that by just seeing a guide on this sub somehow will make the average user throw their casual plans out the window and go the min-max spreedsheet route, which is hardly the case.
---
On the one hand - Go paladin. Every man and his dog is going warrior.
---
Alternative view - play what you want because it’s your game. :)
---
That'll be most guilds...
---
Like finding 40 dedicated and good people is fucking impossible. 
---
Most raids will be 10-20 folks carrying the rest.
---
It's aimed/arcane that share cd.
---
I love your comment. To be fair aiming for #1 on Realm is already a difficult task on the well-sized Realms. I like to min-max too, but often dialogues get lost in (the wrong) numbers and exotic expectations.
---
Idk, I was buying guides for N64 games in the late 90s.  Welcome to 1999 gaming.
---
Raiding is easy up to twin emps.
---
Naxx is not easy in any way. A guild of 40 casuals won’t go far.
---
But agree with rest
---
Looking at this comments section tells me that nobody wants discussion on this sub.  One guy is creating one half of the discussion but is getting disvoted to hell.  Upvote if you disagree with a post.
---
At least on the US Sargeras is still not connected, so yes you see people from other realms, but the Sargeras Trade Chat and Auction House are purely Sargeras, you can't join a guild that is on another realm either.
---
They have Righteous Fury, Seal of Righteousness, and Consecration. Add Retribution Aura, and maybe slap on a Shield Spike and you're good 2 go. Use HoJ if you lose aggro on a mob. Make sure you mark for Skull and focus your AA's on that target. Shouldn't have much issue if DPS gives you a second for threat and doesn't spam AOE too much (although a Prot Pally is actually pretty decent for AOE farming!)
---
Ofc, all this goes out the window as soon as you start talking about 10, 20 or 40 mans. Just respec to Holy at lvl 58 c:
---
I guess if there isn't much time between the meetings, but you're not gonna remember someone from level 10 when you're in high 40s if you cross paths unless It happens multiple times haha
---
Probably not.   
---
But I have had this idea for a while.    
---
Instead of fighting private servers, MONETIZE THEM!   
---
Just like map edits for SC or WC, allow players to World Edit and Item and Mob edit, then charge them a fee for server space.     
---
Allow people to make their own versions of Vanilla.   
---
See what's popular.   
---
People still pay sub fees, and server fees.   Everyone wins.
---
\+zg set trinket and thistle tea. literally the "5seconds-overkill-ambush-backstab-trinket-backstab-tea-trinket"
---
Man, is it all of your first time on the internet?  We were buying guides and looking up things on gamefaqs and ign for Pokemon Red and Blue.  
---
There's nothing wrong at all with having guides and it hasn't spoiled gaming for the last 30 years so I don't think it'll start now.
---
Gold is just a resource, you need to spend it on something.
---
You could try to find a support role in a raiding guild as ret. Get a nightfall for magic procs, toss out blessings, use Divine intervention when needed (wipe protection), and heal somebody when they’re really about to die. 
---
If you can do that all pretty well, you could be a support. You won’t top meters, but nightfall will make up for that. Plus, you have lay on hands and a bubble, two abilities that could save your raid.
---
Nah you're just wrong. Blood Elves weren't even animated similarly to the one's in WC who were badass. They were over the top Disney versions of themselves that hardly would have fit on Alliance and in no way fit the Horde.
---
It was one of the many bad decisions that ultimately turned the game into a shadow of itself.
---
Keep this habit going, it's easier to maintain than to rebuild it from 0.
---
Good job Moo
---
My least favorite karma grab are posts on classicwow that wag their finger at BFA for existing.  Either the poster says they played a month of it and hate that they don't know the names of loot their added to their character rag doll, they can't find any friends because they don't want to join a guild, or they don't like they can catchup to the current patch of gear by doing smaller group content before raiding the current raid on normal in a pug.
---
There are a 100 of these posts from this week alone, maybe thats whay he is acting defesively because, people like op are constantly making the same post shitting on the hard work of others, and how others have fun.
---
Back on Nost, Arcane Shot could proc Nightfall for a while lol
---
Who want's to raid with a bunch of min/maxing neck beard virgins?
---
You aren't going to keep up with hardcore players in this game or any other by playing casually.   Imo being able to accept that is key to enjoying your game of choice.  You'll never be happy if you feel the urge to compete with those who turn the game into a 2nd job.
---
I remember them saying that each phase should take around 6 months to give time for the casual players lol.  Vanilla wow lasted like 2 years and 2 months.  If we had 6 month phases with 6 phases we'd be around a year longer than the actual vanilla schedule.
---
From my experience it's even better: The guilds/raids that actually min max quite often aren't even existant in their final form before the game launches. How many guilds have we all started with, planned every small detailed for the time that comes. And on Day1 only 50% show up online. Week 2 only 30% are left. 1 month later, Raid hits: Now one was either naive and thought people might be ready or eventually figured it makes no sense and forged with 2 other dead guilds to make a full Raid-Roster happen. And then you do have your Undead Warriors, Human Warlocks and what not. But these affect barely anything.
---
Could still be useful for hunters escaping a gank by doing (Feign Death) --&gt; (Lesser Invisibility Potion)
---
I never got the 19 twinking either, but level 39 is fun. You can twink our a rogue with some pretty nuts stuff, grab a nifty stopwatch and mark of the chosen etc and you'll be ambushing people (who arent similarly decked out) for almost 1.5x their life total. I understand the 19 appeal to some degree but most classes don't have their key talents and spells yet so I just never really enjoyed it.
---
That you're a mathematician is believable, because you butchered that joke.
---
Pendulum of Doom
---
I'll gladly throw down ya know, like 30g ~~and 5 necropolis maps~~ if you find one.
---
Its me, your brother.
---
You 80 or something?
---
Meanwhile, all us MGTOWers have been waiting on this moment our entire adult lifes
---
&gt; kiting
---
This is involved in certain boss strategies btw. Not all guilds do it but it can be handy
---
I feel like this guide is referenced every 4th post in this sub.  Nonetheless, I did use it back in ‘07, and it was pretty decent.
---
Not everyone can keep a rhythm mentally. Its also very useful for kiting. I didnt use it in vanilla but will probably do so now as my gaming skill has eroded over time
---
Absolutely!  If you find a sweet blue with tons of extra stats, mana, armor, and health, those should probably be worn if you are wiping on any pull ever.  The pure hardiness that blues provide is great way to mitigate a 100% DPS loss of a dead player.  Otherwise, having extra pieces of green spellpower will improve DPS and kill times at the cost of paying attention to your surroundings and assisting the tank with the kill priorities.
---
Just shot you a PM. Hope to hear from you soon!
---
And that's why trying to "keep up" is useless if you play 8hrs there's someone else playing 12.
---
Wait, 2 weeks? What am I missing here?
---
Thank you for introducing me to r/wowcirclejerk!
---
So, another point in the warlock bin, IIRC, the free mount at 40.
---
For shamans, 3-pieces of Tier2 is pretty great. I remember 5pc T1 being decent for a minute if you didn't have other suitable gear.
---
Okay, finally something I can get behind. I dgaf about wives leaving snacks for their husbands, memes, or art. This shit right here is legitimately cringy as fuck though.
---
For sure. I'd be going for my epic mount, before this I think, though, and spending that time working on AV exalted for Lei of the Lifegiver.
---
Wasn't the pattern Truefaith pretty rare/expensive, also?
---
Where are these guides you speak of.
---
This already exists for us that mod and host private projects. Called NoggIt, look it up. You can make Islands worlds raids dungeon cities custom whatever.
---
Arcanite reaper for orc, prebis for both pve and pvp
---
Learn to read, this is about this subreddit, not about how to play the game. This isn't the place for attention whoring and karma farming. People actually want to talk about the game but those threads are drowned out by the overwhelming flood of nonsense.
---
Clearly you are looking for a different kind of subreddit, one where you can just circlejerk each other off.
---
Just get mining and get grinding
---
Mage for a few specific reasons. 
---
1.	Teleport. Very underrated for someone who doesn’t have a lot of time to play. Being able to port near a farming spot or dungeon makes a huge difference in downtime, especially when you don’t have any. 
---
2.	Self sufficient. You’re not dependent on others to kill, farm, PvP, or even make your own gear. 
---
3.	Hard CC and conjuring food/drink with solid buffs and good DPS make you an easy pick for most dungeons. 
---
4.	Its still fun to play. - only you can decide that one. 
---
Something to consider for healer / tank is that you’ll still have to collect 2 sets of gear (one for dungeons and one for farming). It’s still more work than a pure dps class.
---
Is the difference between Warrior and Feral threat really enough to off-set the fact that druids take more dmg?
---
If the tooltip is saying that in the stress test then it is incorrect. Intellect did not increase spell power in vanilla. It only affected mana, spell crit, and the rate at which you gain weapon skills.
---
Oh, and BTW; it's actually quite easy to heal dungeons 1-58 as a Prot, if you join a group that already has a tank/they need a healer. Just make sure you bring some water along, or that there's a mage. (you'll want to bring water for Tanking anyway tbh).
---
He's not asking if it's possible. He's asking if he will encounter other players who are "good enough" to be Rank 7+ in world pvp.
---
Basically, will high level PvP happen in world PvP or does fair, high level PvP only happen in BGs?
---
its an impossible task, the main subreddit for any popular game always upvotes to the lowest common denominator
---
just like r/dota2 has r/TrueDoTA2 , if you want more serious topics you might need a safe space
---
Well, since we get attack power normalization on most melee attacks, I feel hte Nicker is not as strong as it was.
---
However early in Classic, the IBS is just not obtainable. If you have WF or a lot of sources of '+extra attacks' than the difference in stats and the proc might make the difference.
---
End of the day, you're probably not going to be in a situation where you can just "Choose" readily between the two. If you get the Nicker in phase 1 you're in really good shape. In phase 3 when AV is available, then you might want to consider the grind to the TuF if you haven't naturally gotten a better weapon by then.
---
From my experience those are usually new guild leaders that have never actually raided anything difficult. They always expose themselves by not knowing anything about their role/class. Every Discord server teaches more about their class in 30 minutes than they knew after years of playing it.
---
Might sound oddly specific.. because it is.
---
OP seems to have a legit question and not a lulz joke about TN. So, I'm ready to ban anyone that comes in here with a less-than-constructive comment about TN.
---
IMO, the stats on ICS outweigh the potential proc of TN, as the proc isn't guaranteed to land when you need it.
---
Unpopular Opinion: Using this sub will make the game less enjoyable for all
---
I sunder them lol if I’m a warrior fighting a pally throw onshield pop sunder until full stack then pray for the big hits to scare them off lol.
---
This sub started with the "too easy" narrative after the devs confirmed deadmines elite damage was right. people are saying that because of low level dungeons and how fully bis geared level 30s were clearing for xp, this sub is nearing r/wow each day, and each day im visiting less.
---
I priced out how much it would cost to buy all the mats to power level enchanting using pricing data from a popular private server. It was 370g to buy the mats to level it 1 to 265 and another 110g to get those last 35 levels if you want enchanting 300.
---
Male gnomes have the best animations in the game. Everything they do looks like a grand gesture of some sort. It's beautiful.
---
Cant wait for people staying out of good groups because of race and crying here for a race change. Or taking 4 hours to clear a raid.
---
Putting too much on myself is a concern, I definitely won't take up any other role beyond what i've already said, I don't think it'll be too much. I don't usually burn out in WoW, the last time I did was when MoP launched because I did as many dailies as humanly possible every day. So I am aware and trying to be careful.
---
As for the guild bank, i'm aware it'll be an alt in Classic hence my spreadsheet. Now that I think more about it, why would some corrupt person rise through the ranks just to abuse officer permissions if they can't steal the bank. Maybe I am worried about nothing.
---
Good points about the last part, in Classic they won't really get MORE out of being an officer, just more responsibility, as long as I remember to frame it the way it is I shouldn't be worried.
---
As for finding people, if my guild still isn't formed by Blackwing Lair's launch then yea i'll give up and find a guild. I just hope to be able to recruit enough good souls between the time they announce the realm lists and BWL. Thanks for the tips, you've made me feel better about this :)
---
Yeah that thing is doooope. But it will take a lot of time to get the arcanite xmutes/ gold / and arcane crystals. I was comparing these 2 as more of a choice to use in the meantime, like right at level 60 ding. That proc coukd be nice to help fend of ganks around mining nodes
---
The Classic community will probably be more mature and patient. Try not to forget anyone who is subscribed to retail WoW is also subscribed to Classic WoW by default, and I am worried that's going to mean the servers are swarmed by...a different subset of the community, atleast early on.
---
Out of curiosity, what's the most casual class? Is there a ranking somewhere of most to least casual.
---
Yea its bis till you either go full t2 (if your guild doesn't outlaw hots)or you get the fankriss chest in aq. Its 100% worth it for try hard play. If not your rocking robes of the exhalted till t2 chest.
---
Is warrior really as time-consuming and gold-intensive as everyone makes it out to be? I am not a “casual” player but I’m also not on the neckbeard level either. Is leveling to 60 and clearing content that crazy to do as a warrior? Ideally I’d be a dps but I was open to main tank as well, but from what I’ve seen warriors are absurdly hard to gear for whatever reason.
---
Can low level people hire you?  Is it worth it to bring twinks through dungeons for gold for the items they want to reserve on the run?  I guess you would have to price what a shard or dust would be for that item and get at least equal value.  Don't know if many lowbies would want to pay for a smooth dungeon or not.
---
I have a 34" ultra wide as a primary and a 2k 32" as a secondary.
---
The ultra wide is amazing for games like Path of Exile where you can see for days. The second monitor is big enough on the side where I can easily see discord, wikis, work info, etc. with plenty of desktop space to spare.  
---
Or, you can just go the meme #NoChanges route a dig up an old 14" CRT.

---
IBS is phase 3, Nicker is in Phase 1. its an odd  vs to make, but IBS is better. And its basicly free
---
You think 30ish qualifies as a boomer?
---
But aren't the phases actually similar to content patches in retail? Every phase new raids/dungeons release with better gear (higher ilvl). What if I am 2 phases behind gearwise?
---
&gt; A feral tank can do most of BWL fine
---
Yes if they AQ gear.
---
Something you should expect from AH manipulator...
---
The dude never claimed to have a spouse, kids, friends, family or a life outside of his room
---
Could be that he is just ~~a loser~~ an ”adult” with nothing going on in his life besides work. Would explain why he is hyped for wow
---
I suspect those classes will be Undead and have Will of the Forsaken untapped since your class doesn't have any fear effects. It would be a fun surprise though, perhaps enough to throw them out of their pattern for a second or two so you can turn the tide.
---
You got banned for 72 hours for [this](https://imgur.com/Bfiyar6), and we even told you specifically that you were banned for that. We removed a comment of yours and specifically mentioned that it isn't going to result in a ban, and your response was the above.
---
Oh yeah, no 2.5. I wasn't even counting it really, same with "0.5", but you're right.
---
Polymorph is not a movement impairing effect. So it will still hit you.
---
As for pvp slows/root/stuns will not hit you.
---
OP are you me?
---
Except gear does increase every few months when new phases/raids are introduced. The gear treadmill is there, except we know it will eventually end with Naxx.
---
I have an overall route and my character planned out, but I'm by no means min-maxxing.
---
The longer I make you wait the more satisfaction I will get then someone else will come along and aggro so I can ruin two peoples day.
---
It says 15% right on the tooltip btw.
---
I liked level 39 BGs because people that had move skills benefited a lot.  So hunters shamans and druids made use of their leveling abilities.  Also, it equalized people that had no mounts, so you don't get hunted by epic mount riders for a long while.  There were a lot of skills most classes had, but some great 60 pvpers like warlocks with deathcoil were still off the table.

That's really cool, will check that one! Thanks!

Ice barbed spear wont be available until phase 3, if you want a weapon until ice barbed spear go for demonshear imo
---
Yeah Male gnomes are awsome. Sadly they can't be druids 😂
---
Oh wow I did not realize AV wasnt until phase 3.... totally overlooked that &gt;.&lt;   That changes everything. Thank you
---
&gt; also not a fan of DS being so powerful that spamming shadowbolt became the defacto playstyle for TBC warlocks later on either.
---
Your point is correct, but the details are slightly off. Unless things changed at some point, I distinctly remember using Imp DS for improved fire damage. The rotation was literally just sustain immolate and spam incinerate. That said, while this build was very good for DPS, I got **a ton** of rage for using it. Tanks did **not** like losing the imp HP buff.

I mean, the above comments are just people who cant read tooltips.

Fiery Blaze Enchantment
---
Binds when picked upUse: Enchants a weapon to have a 15% chance to inflict 9 to 14 Fire damage to all enemies within 3 yards.
---
**" to have a 15% chance"**
---
Phase 1 will only last maybe 2-3 months after Classic launches.  Phase 2 will likely be a similar amount of time.  This means more casual players will more than likely not see the game until phase 2 or 3.  That's really not that big of a deal, in my opinion.  
---
Phase 1 is just MC and Ony with no PvP system.  Phase 2 will be Dire Maul (a godsend for casual players) and the PvP system.  That's not even close to a big deal to reach 60 in phase 2 instead of 1.  You're not "missing" anything besides a meta where pre-raid BiS doesn't include some dungeon gear from DM.  No one should cry over missing that.  
---
Phase 3 comes with Warsong Gulch, Alterac Valley, Blackwing Lair, and the Darkmoon Faire.  Again, this doesn't change the meta AT ALL really, besides adding a raid.  Casuals will have more fun in this patch due to BGs and some Darkmoon events, but nothing really game changing.  
---
Phase 4-6 is where it starts to change the game.  Arathi Basin isn't a big deal, but Zul'Gurub is pretty huge.  That raid makes a lot of gear more attainable overall.  I expect these to last quite a bit longer.
---
Schedule like this ~September the game comes out with phase 1.  Phase 2 comes in late October.  Phase 3 starts in late December.  Phase 4 in May.  Phase 5 in September of next year and phase 6 starting in January 2021.

A monitor cable.

Im pretty sure this is exactly how it works on private servers as well, so not really any different from there.
---
Leveling?
---
Pros; Can tank any dungeon 1-60 in any spec. Meaning you'll always very quickly find a group for any dungeon you want/need.
---
Cons; Everything else. The above is the ONLY pro for warrior leveling.
---
Bonus; Not leveling related, but once you get to 60 everything will pay off hugely. You'll be the best class in the game.
---
not really, i guess difference is that they could choose not take second weapon talent point and spend it elsewhere in standard combat build. very minor difference. I guess for seal fate it is better since you cant get weapon skill from talents so human have 305 over 300 there. So it is flexible in that sense but you dont ever need to go seal fate.

Congratulations, you got it.

Seriously though, there is nothing left to talk about in this game besides "what class should I play". You really need to lighten up.

Fishing is actually great for a break. What I usually do is use fishing breaks to work out. Every fish I catch I'll do like 10-20 pushups. Next fish I catch 10-20 sit ups, next fish I catch do some other exercise. It's a good way to get the blood circulating while still accomplishing something in the game.

These are part of most people's adult existence, though. Also, even if you remove the kids and family, we're still talking about some bullshit here. If you're pulling 10 hour shifts, there's no room to play 6-7 hours of wow every day unless you have insomnia.

Very thorough guide. Thank you.

Resto shaman is probably the most sought after class in a raid comp.

Yep! Thanks, dude - saw that I have the ability to install as well. Was hoping it'd just be a server and not a brand new client

Cant wait to gank and corpse camp you anti min/maxers.
---
Def and Mel are cool as fuck
---
This might sound weird but it’s a genuine question: who are you guys making fun of?
---
I love Grizzly hills and it’s my favorite wow music. Are you making fun of me, or the people that post it over and over, or the people that upvote it? I really don’t care either way, I’m honestly just curious because you clearly enjoy wow, so it’s not obvious to me what the angle of the humor is. But I know meta humor is complex sometimes so if there’s no good answer then I get it
---
This is the best plan for Druids for sure. If you were playing a class that can't get around as easily and really wants that mount at 40 (so needs every single copper along the way) I would recommend just doing enchanting later when you can farm dungeons. Taking skinning and herbalism/mining until 40 and just vendoring the heck out of everything is the gold sprint I think a lot of people are doing, then in the 50s you can go blast SM to pieces and d/e everything to level enchanting and tailoring.
---
In PvP though you will only be facing 8 of them.
---
Your intentions were good, I would have taken that trade. Even if I wanted that copper and not especially tin. I would've taken the Tin and be happy you at least killed a mob. Some people wait until you pull and then take the resource themselves. And they wait again at the next one. If you start waiting, they wait longer. You were doing good.
---
On the other hand. Write a letter for your loved ones, track his location, get a baseball bat and knock that f\*cker out.
---
You can take tailoring as your second profession and make some stuff to DE and make some bags too.  Also if you farm low level stuff you can use the cloth to make stuff to sell or de
---
Surface level advice: of course, play whatever you want.
---
Deeper expectations vs. reality advice: Warriors really are more suited for the most hardcore players because of how reliant they are on gear and support, and also their slow leveling process.
---
The leveling is slower than any other class because you lack the self-healing/control/survivability mechanics other classes do. If you're on a PvP server, it's even worse because Warriors are very widely countered especially if they don't get the jump. So you're already adding a lot of play time just in your leveling.
---
Then once you get to max level, unlike other classes who aren't so gear-reliant, you'll need to already have an in with a guild to raid (as warrior is a pretty popular class) with a lot of competition for gear (again warriors and melee in general being pretty popular), which includes a lot of dungeon grinding and or expenses for pre-raid gear. Also, in the first phase of Classic, there won't be a lot of good sources of gear for Warriors outside of raids (like AV), so you'll feel compelled to raid to rise above a feeling of mediocrity. This is compounded by not being able to farm very well compared to other classes. Then you'll probably need to keep raiding consistently to keep a raid spot or at least be a contender for that juicy high demand melee loot.
---
A lot of people will be rolling Warriors because they see them on top of the meters or blowing up in BGs, etc. But people really underestimate the time and work it takes to get to that level, and also how much they need support classes to prop them up.
---
Priest seems like a much more suitable option for a more casual player. Not only are they less-gear reliant, but it's easier to come by and there's less competition for it. Priests are average levelers but still much faster and safer than Warrior. As a healer you will always be in high demand in PvE and PvP. As DPS, you will probably only be able to raid with casual guilds, as I think hardcore guilds will expect you to heal. You'll also probably be expected to heal dungeons even if you're specced shadow. In PvP, shadow priests are a really strong candidate for a spec that doesn't require a lot of gear or skill to be effective, so that's fun. but they are also extremely mana hungry which means a lot of drinking and not being able to fight for long periods of time (which is why they struggle finding spots in raids). You might find Warrior as a good option for an alt later on once more content is released, which gives you access to good, more easily obtained gear outside of raids (Ice-barbed Spear as early as 51 will last you until Unstoppable Force, and basically all AV gear). That's what I'll be doing.
---
**TL;DR**: If you're willing to put in hardcore amounts of time, consistently raid, or consistently playing with a group, Warrior is a good pick, because they payoff is worth it. If time is a concern, you don't want to feel like you NEED to raid, or if you're playing solo a good bit, you're going to find more success and satisfaction with another class, and Priest is a good fit for that.
---
So there should be a debuff slot for the *one* feral dps? yeah right.
---
ZG is literally a catch up raid for casual players.  Of course it's going to come out after BWL...
---
I am so close to being this guy! is it worth it?
---
I get why you disagree, but because people are trashing your analogy, I'll clear it up for them.
---
If a bunch of new players read these guides or whatever and they start to min-max their asses off, they're going to get toxic and shitty and hateful whenever somebody new doesn't min-max as well.
---
We all know damn good and well you can clear 5 mans with just about any composition. Half the struggle with actual Vanilla was that everybody's computers and internets sucked asshole. Now that we don't have those problems, it's going to be easier than it was in 2005. But, because of the proliferation of information about the game, we're going to have so many toxic little shits running around screeching "WARRIOR IS THE ONLY VIABLE DPS AND TANK" and getting shitty about it.
---
And if you think I'm fucking joking, look at the WoW sub circa 6 months ago and see what was said about shaman. People legitimately wouldn't allow shamans into groups, even though it didn't fucking matter a single bit because they're not Method and 3% variance in dps means fuckall. 
---
So yes, guides affect players that aren't reading them because they change the attitude and the expectations of those around them, which is never a positive effect. It just breeds elitism and toxicity and that's going to be a net negative comparative to when Vanilla was retail and nobody knew shit because nobody on the planet was older than 14 and MMOs had just been invented.
---
Did I misremember and this wasn't possible in Vanilla then? And instead back then you could make macros that automatically heal the best target and that doesn't work anymore?
---
You can't stop the min/maxers from current game from applying the same crap to classic. People are gonna rush thru and be bored after 3 mos and then go back to retail, just in time for 8.3.
---
It will probably be shit groups too.
---
I highly, highly doubt they will last longer than Vanilla.
---
What I try to do is get a hit in, I don't care about the node, I care about the 1-4 tin, I care about the skill increase 9/10. I wait till people are done with mobs next to a node to see if they are going to go for it or not, I actually met a long term friend this way. The amount of appreciation you get is actually often stunning, and feels really nice to boot.
---
I would run 2 x gathering prof and when 60 is reached just solo a few dongeon easily (stockade is a crazy fast run with multiple greens, sfk lot of blues, later on uldaman and rfk/rfd still easily soloable and fast)
---
I'm happy to help. 
---
You may have some luck if you start recruiting now. We started recruiting about a month ago on this subreddit and various discord channels, and I have found that most people who are looking for guilds at this stage are taking it fairly seriously. The closer we get to launch, the more diverse the player base is going to get (meaning you'll have to do more work to sort out who is a good fit), and the more competition you will have.

Hey man, I'm an officer in a Horde PvE Semi-Hardcore guild. We are looking to start raiding in October, and really put a focus on community and having a good time. If you have a discord and are interested, feel free to give me your name and I can hook you up!

Nice try, Mr Trump.

 **About Us:** A freshly formed guild looking to have a good time in the world of Azeroth. We want to clear content but not at a hardcore pace (We save the hardcore stuff for the bedroom 📷). So often guilds preach of inclusion but it’s hard to break through the clique, but here at Grayskull full inclusion is what we aim for. 
---
 **Raid Info:** We are currently shooting for raids to be between 9-11EST Monday and Tuesday with possibly a little Sunday action. We hope to have multiple raid teams which times will be TBD. We have experienced vanilla players but I admittedly wasn’t super hardcore during vanilla so some veteran raid leaders would be well received.  
---
**Who we’re looking for:** 
---
\* Like minded gamers (If the guild name intrigued you, you’re probably someone we’re looking for)
---
 \* Someone who has a sense of humor. Unfortunately the line to HR has been disconnected.
---
 \* Someone who plays a game to actually have fun... squares need not apply.  
---
We look forward to having you on the team. Any questions or comments you can reach out to me on discord through DM or just hop on the server. By the power of Grayskull!

if you are just playing wow 144hz is not required.
---
my Tv is 100hz (might be 120) and there is no (or very little) noticable difference between 75hz and 100hz so 144hz for wow is way over kill.
---
IMO wow would look better if you instead of looking or 144hz 1080p monitor maybe go for 100hz 1440p.
---
This, become unfuckable
---
Kargoz's field manual is good but has some blatant flaws, mainly in that there is a lot of mismatching in terms of what items are available in what phase. It's also missing Savage Gladiator Chain from the pre-raid bis chest section, even though he devoted two slides for chests.
---
Agreed.  Phase 1 only exists for the hardcore players that are leveling up and raiding within the first week WITHOUT DM gear.  Casuals won't notice a single difference between phase 1 and 2.
---
You forgot belts. But the somewhat absence of good options early on only makes Netherwind good in comparison, this doesn't actually make it objectively good, the itemization still makes it bad for 8/8. Caster itemization from phase 4 content and forward is so much better.
---
True faith will last you at least until T2 from Nefarian, it is definitely worth the investment.
---
Kinda.
---
WoW has some guidelines on the game about what to do and you don't need external help to understand.
---
Cooking instead you need a little help to understand the basics, but if you rely on recipe books to learn how to cook, then you won't be able to modify your dishes to what you enjoy. Example, you learn how to cook meat using beer to give it flavour and make it more tender, and because you learn it that way you don't think that you could use wine instead of beer until you read another recipe that does that.
---
Hunter, Mage, Warlock, Rogue
---
My guess is Naxx in January of 2021 so we aren't far off.
---
&gt; clear most of MC in first reset
---
Yea that's not happening. Classic launches at 6pm PST on a Thursday. The first reset happens at 12am on the following Tuesday. That's 5 days and 6 hours between the launch and first reset. The record for 0-60 on a fresh server playing the fastest leveling class in the game is just under 5 days. 
---
Hypothetically speaking even if you did some extreme account sharing and managed to get close to 40 players to level 60 at a world record pace you're not clearing shit with a raid of mostly hunters wearing level 45 quest greens.
---
&gt; These guides tell people exactly where to level, what quests to skip, which talent points to take and leave. taking all agency from the player.  
---
Agency is player choice. The guides simply give the players one more choice in how to play the game (get to 60 fast). Otherwise, they can still choose to explore, grind, whatever.
---
This. Druids are at a severe disadvantage due to itemisation/talents and parry/block/defense mechanics. If a guild is letting a druid MT they are wasting everyone's time.
---
Rogue. The only job they have outside of doing DPS is to disarm traps in BWL. All other things they do can be done by other classes.
---
&gt; A lot of people here on reddit regurgitate the same mantra of "play any class you want" and I am of that mentality too. But people need to understand the consequences of whatever class they pick. They need to have the full picture to make an informed decision.
---
This. So much this. Yet people downvote everytime someone explains that people *are* going to have issues with suboptimal specs. 
---
"Just play what you want" can fk right off. Don't recommend people to make a questionable decision when they are uninformed. Assholes.
---
I agree with you entirely and I have been saying the same thing for the last couple weeks on this sub.  Casuals won't see endgame in Phase 1 and that's totally fine.  DM catch up gear isn't that big of a deal and it adds endgame content.  Phase 2 will be out in 8-10 weeks I think.
---
Okay, thanks for your answer! Now I learned a new word too, never heard succession before :D
---
**&lt;Life Uhhhh Gets In The Way&gt;  NA // PVP // ALIANCE // Casual Raiding** 
---
Raid times:  **Alternating Tuesday and Monday nights @ 6:30 PDT**   (To be clear – this means **ONE** night per week) 
---
The main thing to note about &lt;Life Uhhhh Gets In The Way&gt; is the raid schedule.  The initial group is comprised of people that played classic together many moons ago, most of whom are too old to play like we used to, but are also powerless against pull of nostalgia.  As such, in order to keep our wives happy we'll be raiding one night per week.  To begin with we will alternate between Tuesday to Monday nights.  This way we can run the same raid timer twice without playing twice per week.    
---
Because of the limited frequency of our raids I expect us to run MC/Ony exclusively for longer than your average multi-night raiding guild.  A subset of the guild is welcome to start attempting new content as it releases, but my primary concern is getting MC on farm.  Once we come to a consensus that MC has little left to offer, we will shift to BWL, and so on.  Members will obviously be free to pursue other raid timers during the weeks where we return to a raid on Monday before the reset.  Once Molten Core can be completed in one night (which I don't expect to take terribly long) we will raid every Tuesday instead, using each reset. 
---
DKP for the loot system.  Pretty basic, blind bid, 10% decay every week, the details are in our Discord. 
---
The tentative date of our first Onyxia, and hopefully subsequent Molten Core attempt, is before the end of October.  I realize that giving only six weeks or so to level is counter to the whole casual appeal of this guild, if a member needs more time than that it's not a problem.  Many of us, myself included, are going to attack leveling with an unhealthy zeal that will only be able to last so long before divorce becomes imminent.  Our first run may include a few level 58 healers, it may include a few PUGs, these things should not be a source of stress.  We are not going for any records, the most important thing to start with is to get in there and start teaching the fights.   
---
One note on the casual nature of this guild: it doesn't mean I'm looking for lazy raiders.  We are casual due to frequency, that doesn't mean you don't have to know your class / at least make an effort on consumables.  Molten Core is not particularly difficult, but I would like to get to Ragnaros as quickly as possible.  In order to do this we will need to remain focused during the raids.  That said, the core group is pretty easy going. 
---
On that same note, I would like to run this with as close to 40 active raiders as possible.  Seeing as we'll only be raiding once per week – my hope is that the majority of members will be at every raid.  Life is never so straight forward, so I will be recruiting some alternates, but for the most part I'd like to keep the roster tight. 
---
We're all very excited, this should be a lot of fun.  Here's hoping some of you join us in the Molten Core and beyond. 
---
PM me if you're interested.    I will start an email list and keep everyone updated.  Because our schedule is so simple, I see no need to make a website, if our members want one I will make one.    
---
Right now we can still take any class.  If you're unsure of your class let me know what you're considering.  I can probably only take one more Druid and one more Warrior Tank max.  If you need help deciding, I am a fountain of classic knowledge. 
---
Thanks for reading!  See you in Azeroth.
---
It was good for short fights.
---
no we weren't.  this was about honor rewards in bgs vs world pvp. you know you can scroll up and look at previous comments, right? you mentioning it not being in phase 3 had 0 relevance, hence my comment
---
And you will rarely ever get 5 capped unless you are a pug vs a premade. most AB games are 3-2 and both get honor, particularly bonus honor for losses. hell, same goes for wsg if you get caps, but those are far more likely to be shutouts than AB. it is the biggest problem of course in AV, though.
---
and I never assumed anything. even backing down from multiple games is more worth it in the long run. of course at one point I remember our group picking people to duel another premade for caps after an hour and a half stalemate, but xrealm bgs makes that not really feasible.
---
Yeah, I hate this sort of shit. Play whatever the fuck you want. As long as you don't suck and arrive to the raids on time with your shit repaired, you're going to be fine.
---
8/8 t1 is insane for shammies. Turns HW into chain heal.
---
Generally I only hear that from people who didn’t actually play Vanilla and their only experience is from private servers. 
---
The first raiding guild I was in actually had a majority of NE rogues and we all did fine. I raided through AQ40 (during content pushing phase, not after it was on farm status) and stopped playing a bit before Naxx. A race will never preclude you from anything in this game. 
---
Learn your class and be a decent person and you can do whatever you want in Classic.
---
I guess like the other guy said, don't get the DPS trinket from the Onyxia attunement chain, get the tank one, plus the Maraudon quest reward and ignore enchanting.  That would be the best way to not make it a gold dump.  Then you can keep gathering professions on your speedster druid.
---
Take it, leave one for him to skill up maybe
---
Warlock, because Blueberry is best tank.
---
Yes, attrition will be very high. The class was made significantly more tolerable thanks to certain bugs/unfaithful mechanics on private servers but these will not work in classic. Even with these "exploits" available many people gave up.
---
A potential saving grace is that dungeons in classic are allegedly much easier and more rewarding than on private servers, so much so that it can be much more efficient than questing (20% faster based on some tests I saw). If you can grind dungeons consistently your life will be much easier, but expect to tank and not DPS. Being the only warrior in the group would be ideal anyway since you wouldn't have to fight over gear.
---
It wont be so bad, most guilds/people will still be running around in MC gear for a long time and working on their pvp blues, only the hardcore guilds will be decked out in Naxx gear when it's released, etc. I am imagining that after about a month into phase 3 we will see some really mean BG premades though.
---
Boomkin!
---
because you needed them to down the boss during that specific raid
---
otherwise why are they there?
---
Once the economy stabilizes, a good tip is to purchase items on the AH that DE into mats at greater value.  It's a small thing, but can save you a lot of gold in the long run.  I found it easier to farm other items like various cloth/herb/mining as I leveled and liquidated that stuff on the AH, then built up an inventory of DE'ables and dust etc.  Store on a bank alt, and then switch professions on your main when you have enough to go to 265.
---
Several parts of T2.5 is pretty great for fury warriors aswell and the shoulders are BIS.
---
They're dead on retail for three reasons.
---
1. RPPvE came out first. RP is heavily community-based, so once players are invested and have their circles and relationships built, they're not likely to want to move. Thus, RPPVP servers were sleepy from the get-go.
---
2. RPPvPers are the sort of players who identify most with Classic-style gameplay. We like world PvP. We like RPG elements. We like the vast world and its dangers, we like that immersion and we dislike instanced content. Thus, RPPvPers were the first to be discouraged with changes to the game as WoW's lifecycle progressed. We are the core target audience for Classic WoW.
---
3. As I said before, RP is heavily community based. Therefore, when RPPvP servers started dying off in MoP, many RPPvPers who didn't quit threw in the towel and moved to the big RPPvE servers, inflating their numbers with users who really would prefer the old RPPvP style. I saw this happen in real time on my server, Twisting Nether US. Go to MG/WRA and you'll find tons of TN players who moved because they got tired of seeing empty towns. It's a snowball effect.
---
So, owing to #1, if you release RPPvP after launch and not AT launch, it will create a self-fulfilling prophecy. RPers will be established on the RPPvE, won't want to move, RPPvP will be underpopulated when it launches, and blizzard will say see, we told you so!
---
DE spec
---
Haha fair
---
Follow the golden rule. Be a white knight even if it’s only you. Make the world a better place
---
Ehhh Im still watching netflix anyway lol
---
So just dont read it? Honestly, why are you trying to tell people how to play the game they want to?
---
shitpost
---
A casual player takes about 10 days or 240 hours played  to hit 60, at 15 hours played a week it will take about 4 months for you to hit 60. Pre raid Bis takes about  ~2-4 days played to get about 80% pre raid Bis.
---
no, you can however have someone invite you to a group and reset the instance for a similar work around.
---
That's very true, but its also unknown if Blizz in that scenario would allow you to port over your character to a TBC server, and maintain a copy on the classic server.
---
Priest will have a Word.
---
Way more than 3%, not sure why you're being downvoted.
---
Which class has the most involved ability rotation for lvl 60 content? Idc whether you bring up tank, heal, or dps, but for instance, just spamming a frost bolt all raid long doesn't sound too fun.
---
In other words, what classes uses the most spells in their normal fight rotation for raids/dungeons?
---
If you can come to an agreement on how to mine that’s fine.  If he just wants to take everything, the fuck him.  You do the same.
---
Rogue doesn't matter really, true.  But he was complaining about the Gnome Warrior thread.
---
Of course, whoever wins the roll is entitled to the loot. Feel free to argue.
---
Hey man... yes, that my exact model
---
username checks out.
---
Let's be real, 99% of twinks were not trying to organize fights vs other twink guilds. It was just to completely overpower non-twinks.
---
I still wouldn't recommend everyone to roll a bear over a warrior. You have to farm more consumables and the gear progression is kinda meh for druids. They don't even get any *good* raiding gear before AQ, if i remember correctly.
---
Also, I'm very sceptical that druids are actually better at generating threat. I've raided with several druid tanks and they were all worse compared to the warriors. Why isn't every tryhard guild using feral tanks if they are so good? 
---
The truth is that the damage taken between a Warrior and a Druid is very significant. Druids lack block and parry. If you're up against a boss that deals a significant amount of damage there's just a very big difference between facetanking and parrying or blocking a strong attack.
---
 I know that there's that Skarm dude who really tries to sell everyone on the feral tanking. 
---
I just haven't seen it happen in practise - Those druids were fairly tryhard too.
---
&gt; I 'drew/knitted/visited/baked/painted' my favourite 'character/sigil/scene'
---
Trying to imagine the mindset someone must have to consider the above 'asinine low-effort content'.
---
If HoJ is bis for Hunter, nobody is going to call the hunter a ninja, c'mon now...
---
If a hunter/rogue/druid/shaman were in your WC run and leggings if the Fang dropped, and you rolled against them, you could definitely be viewed as a ninja
---
i would say gratz, and tell him " - you now owe us if we need a tank." I would do the Same thing is Quel'Serrar dropped for a prot warrior.  
---
But i know some people just see $ instead of someones item progression
---
Yeah if I went Shadow I would basically make myself last priority on loot that is good for locks and mages, for the good of the raid.
---
whoops, I meant to reply that to the guy who was talking about a hunter ninja looting hand of rag
---
They were mostly useful for the resistance iirc for locks
---
It's +5 from talents.
---
&gt; you would know that if you had ever been in a ranking group, which you obviously haven't.
---
You're right, so obvious. [Not like I hit Rank 12 in vanilla](https://i.imgur.com/wiLK9i5.png) or several times since on pservers or anything.
---
So it turns into like 2% sinister strike and evisc damage. 
---
It really isn't a big deal for rogues.
---
when meming yes, on the internet it's been that way for a good while now
---
I just got dual curved 31.5" AOCs on amazon for under 200 bucks each, really happy with them.
---
Yep, it's part of why alch is a hugely underrated pvp profession. You've never seen a such a shock as a retadin who watches his SoC proc get absorbed because you chugged a holy protection potion. Most of the elemental absorb pots are very cheap to make, and since they last an hour it's not insane to just prechug a bunch of them when in an active pvp zone so you are prepared without having to burn your  potion cool down.
---
Yes it is certainly possible to just buy these potions, but you save massive amounts of cash farming the mats and making them rather than hoping somebody put random pots up on the AH.
---
Insulting someone in private and then being upset that the words you used to insult someone are shared publicly is a really immature look.
---
You made a false claim and they refuted it with evidence. Now you've back tracked, moved goal posts (Post removal =/= Ban), and called out the mods integrity because your private name calling got exposed.
---
Reflect a little and grow up bud 
---
Mods aren't perfect, but they're doing an unpaid job out of passion to best fit as many audiences as possible. Your specific idea on what acceptable moderation is does not fit all groups.
---
Nice guide, never thought i would miss that install button lol
---
It means you will not be zoning into raid tonight.  But, you have to stick around on voice, because sure enough someone will leave the raid and you will need to be right outside the zone in to get the next boss pull going.  You can level an alt during that time, or you can just afk on your main and do chores, clean up, play another game or watch tv.  But you need to have your raider very close to the instance so you can be ready when called upon.
---
"believing oneself to be inherently deserving of privileges or special treatment." Winning a loot roll isn't entitlement tho.
---
Warlock, even though I played mage through entire vanilla I always regretted it wasnt a warlock. Not making the same mistake this time around.
---
If the option is dwarf vs. not dwarf then the answer is dwarf.

#  &lt;Singularity&gt;
---
**About Us:** On the spectrum from Casual Raiders to Hardcore Raiders, we are positioned somewhere in the middle. We will strive to be the most efficient raiding guild on the server to minimize the weekly time commitment for our members. Many of our founding members have been raiding in WoW since 2004. We are also an avid World PVP guild that will plan weekly events to put our hard-earned epics to good use. In terms of server location, we plan to be on a US East PvP server to provide reasonable ping to North American and European members alike.
---
**Loot System:** Loot Council. With a specific emphasis on rewarding high performing dedicated players to drive rapid progression. Additional measures are in place for fairness and to reward up-and-comers.
---
**Raid Times:** Will be Saturday &amp; Sunday morning from 9:00 AM - 11:00 AM Eastern Time. Once we have MC &amp; Ony on farm, we will be able to get this down to a single day, two-hour commitment per week.
---
We are currently recruiting all classes with an emphasis on ranged DPS and heals (shamans in particular), but all are welcome.
---
**To Apply:** [https://singularity.guildlaunch.com/](https://singularity.guildlaunch.com/)
---
If you have any questions please contact me or you can contact Silverback#8426 or BuffGamer#3520 on discord.
---
The other examples people are giving are much too specific for me.
---
I would say ninjaing is taking an item against group expectations. So a hunter taking HoJ when a rogue/warrior wants it would be ninjaing to me because I would expect the item to be given to someone for who it is a huge upgrade in DPS for a long time instead of a temporary stat stick. The same would go for blackcrow in LBRS for example, just with the classes swapped. Note that because I said excepted this can be negated by just communicating beforehand about what you need or want.
---
To cover your other example a warrior taking leggings of the fang is not ninjaing since I expect him to take it because it's quite likely a big stat upgrade for him (at the cost of some armour) which will help him greatly while leveling.
---
You can leverage your role for that. With tanks always being in such short supply most people are fine with you reserving grays, chests, boss drops, etc. as long as you make it clear when you're filling the group.
---
Just report it if you feel like it breaks a rule.
---
Well Paladin can't really tank at all, but there will be many Druid tanks because they are actually very good at tanking in vanilla.
---
Combat beats seal fate for a long long time because of weapon expertise. 
---
Converting to Seal Fate and having good returns is hard, because you lose so much white damage, and you need to use ACGL.
---
I think late AQ at earliest, and that's with great gear luck.
---
According to a stream I watched on Thursday before beta went down it was fixed.  There will probably be a final stress test, so you can always subscribe to wow and get into test it yourself instead of just basing it off of streamers and what we observe and hear from second hand accounts.
---
Thanks a lot for the answers guys. Like I mentioned in my post, I was wondering “how hard” it would be, obviously not expecting to have the same things or be able to compete with hardcore grinders, which some people didn’t manage to process somehow. I mentioned I never played classic before, therefore having no single clue how the game will be like when it came to the gear and grind etc. I’ve always been a fan of wow at the early expansions, but never had the opportunity to play so I had to stick to other MMO’s always wishing I was playing wow 😅 - Now as I’m getting the chance, of course I’ll have simple questions. I really hope the community is great - I see a lot of nice people on this thread with very helpful answers and a few with not so helpful ones injected with toxicity, but that’s how every community is like, right? Thanks for all the answers guys, I got the answers and help I was looking for. Until then, see you at launch and happy grinding!
---
Are you illiterate or just blind?
---
Sizzle.
---
This. Pre-normalization The Nicker would have been a contender, but the speed doesn't mean all that much with the version we're getting.
---
Warlock! Underplayed/underrrated, very fast, fun, efficient levelers, free mount @ 40 cannot be overstated, huge in WPVP, nearly unkillable in PvE OR PvP, soulstone/ankh if you do happen to die while leveling, or wipe recovery in 5 mans, summons are huge in vanilla, and soul shard farming isn't NEARLY as bad as everyone makes it out to be. A wonderful class for Classic.
---
Roll what you like, be a nice person, learn how to play your class, show up with consumables, have fun...everything will work out.
---
IMO, you should only roll for things that are a direct upgrade, you will be putting on right after winning the roll (unless you need to enchant first), and for the spec you are playing in the dungeon.  I'd be pissed if, as a rogue or something, our healer shaman rolled on a major upgrade.  If they ask and you agree then it doesn't matter, but if they just roll, I'd be kinda upset.
---
I usually set up dungeon groups to ensure that no one is competing with each other.
---
Very cool reasons, all of them are strong.  Thanks!
---
Im glad you posted that the recipe is a drop....i completely forgot about that. I doubt I'll be able to spam dungeons like I used to so maybe I'll take a look at the next best thing. Bummer.
---
What is it then? If not following a general social consensus that whoever wins the roll gets the loot?
---
Nixeus edg27 v2. Slightly out of your price range but worth it for an IPS in my opinion.
---
Haha yeah I was amused by a couple of the responses making it seem like my life sucks because I can’t game for 4-5 hours a night...
---
Gnomish cloaking device does this, but 1hr cooldown
---
Since I always played magnanimously, I would probably do the same thing. There really aren't a ton of scenarios where the BOE item is BIS at end game, but that's definitely one of them.
---
Is this the case for warlock and mage 2? Only tier 2 beats it?
---
Careful on this sub, people get super butthurt when you point out the obvious
---
Sounds like there's multiple Orc/Troll players so why doesn't the tauren player run to orc/troll starting zone? I've done it as an undead for the rep of the quests and as far as i can tell every quest has been available to me. The only issue would be if you're a Druid then there's probably no trainer for you there. But if the orc/troll players are mage/warlock/rogue/priest then there's no trainer in the tauren starting zone for them.
---
&gt; play whatever you want however you want to play it.
---
fuck this
---
Having played a mage for 15 years and a warlock for about 5 as an alt. Mage is by far my favorite in terms of utility. Warlock has amazing survivability. For reference currently playing a mage clearing Naxx on a private server. Strongly considering Lock for PVP purposes as Classic launches.
---
My observations on the two classes below.
---
Mage: 
---
High DPS
---
Ports to 3 cities and hearthstone. Makes world travel super fast
---
Free water/food
---
Mana gems (free pot every few minutes)
---
Slowfall
---
Blink
---
Frost spec - great AOE farming for leveling and Dire Maul East/North
---
Fire spec - crazy raid dps for AQ40/Naxx
---
Relative easy hit cap with 6% in frost tree.
---
Negatives: You drink a lot. And will die a lot. Glass cannon mentality. Conjuring water for the raid can be a pain. Warlocks and shadow priests will own you (if played well). Consistently.
---
Warlock:
---
HIGH survivability
---
Void tank
---
Shield with void sacrifice (x2 if you have master summoner)
---
Soulstone
---
Healthstone
---
Fear
---
Deathcoil (fear and heal)
---
Negatives: Hit cap is a bitch. No threat dump other than death. Summoning and farming shards. Handing out healthstones to a 40man raid. Sometimes only 1-2 locks per raid. At least on ally side.
---
Will it be possible to skip long runs by intentionally dying to get teleported to a graveyard further ahead and use rez sickness? For instance, going from IF to Menethil Harbor?
---
Back pedaling is very useful in some PVP situations though, and marginally useful for PVE.
---
originated.
---
Back then it was priest. I saw a friend's shadow priest and thought "I gotta get me some of that!". I learned from that experience that I enjoy healing, that being a battle medic was pretty damn great, and that if I still wanted to spec shadow I could pop off once in a while on a healing class. It's shaman now, because I like the challenge of being a more micro-managing healer. And much like the priest, I can spec elemental once in a while when I feel like popping off. Plus you can turn into a wolf.
---
What's the issue with speed, don't slow weapons still have higher damage in 1.12?
---
While I understand and respect that, if I were the rogue/shaman in question I'd be fucking pissed knowing that warrior is gnna replace that with the first blue +str mail pants they find, when I could be rocking those leggings for potentially the next 15 levels or so. (Or at least until Gnomergan Q reward, in this case).
---
I really wish I could filter out these "I'm an adult now" posts. 
---
You've played WoW from Vanilla to WoD. Unless you're just a complete moron then you likely would have developed a basic understanding of the classes by now. None of the classes are going to turn the hour you have to play into 6 hours. An hour is an hour. You likely will never reach 60, and you definitely won't see any end-game content. You also aren't going to be gold farming with so little time to play. So just pick whatever class sounds fun to you...
---
Also, I'm sorry to hear you only have 6-7 hours of free time to yourself a week.
---
Personally I think ninja looting is taking an item that is not a direct upgrade of what you currently have.
---
Idk, mages make a strong case in 1v1 by nature of their cc and mobility, as well. Especially against any melee class. A good one can really fuck with hunters/dead zone, as well. So by then you're kind of narrowing down their weaknesses to a similar basket as rogues. 
---
But if you're looking for pure pvp build/leaning class, for sure rogue or mage, before you factor in playstyle considerations.
---
I will choose to main Warrior in classic because I love to be the guy up front with the responsibility in dungeons while not necessarily being stuck playing a tank in raids.
---
I'm pretty sure Wowhead copied over an old database of the items from back in vanilla. Back then the only information we had on things was through comments from people who figured out information on their own.
---
Not really - the splash healing it does is very small by comparison. I used it as a meme a few times, and it really wasn't that great compared to just casting chain heal. Once you get 3pc T2, the actual chain heal gets even better too.
---
Speaking of memes, 8pc T2 for shaman is a serious one. We would all throw it on til we got lightning shields to proc on the whole raid, then start a fight like Vael. Super silly honestly.
---
Ok cool.
---
&gt;The real question is: is it worth it to level up enchanting to craft Smoking Heart of the Mountain to use as second trinket over Mark of the Chosen?
---
I always prefer passive stats over something that depends on a proc, because unless you get a proc it's essentially worth nothing. Any proc rate on pservers is almost assuredly different from what it will be on classic. Since Mark of the Chosen is obtainable from a late-40's lvl quest, will it compare to a higher level trinket? I'd lean towards Not, until more information about the viability in Classic is available.
---
I might look toward Mark if I"m going to be tanking large packs of mobs, because the chances of getting a proc are pretty good.
---
I like that I’m the only class that can tank raids.
---
Plan out what you're going to do before your session.  It's easy for some, because you can finish a smaller zone in less than 4 hours.  But you're going to want to look up the quests for a dungeon so maybe when you log on for that session you're already good to go and can just hop right in a group rather than trying to fit the gathering of quests from all around the world into the same limited time session.
---
As I said, if you're desensitized to reddit's "the wifey bought me a switch for my vasectomy" culture which poofs into existence once a sub reaches a certain size, it's probably great.
---
But viewing this culture from the outside, and watching niche subreddits slowly turn into a cesspool of aforementioned content, it's not really that appealing to us.
---
IBS sadly wont be available at launch but technically you can get it at 51 not 60.
---
Hand of Justice? Do you really mean [This Hand of Justice?](https://classicdb.ch/?item=11815) Because any hunter getting that is a gigantic asshole.
---
How lol
---
As you can already see in the comments, there is no objective definition of where the line is. This is why there is so much toxicity regarding it - it is not just people crossing the line, it's people disagreeing about the line. To make it worse, people tend to make their opinion quite biased toward what helps their class. Below is a few of the versions I've encountered the most (and some thoughts on them).
---
* If it is on your BiS list it's fair game. This might seem objectively fair, but problem arises due to importance. For example, Dal'Rend is BiS for hunter, but it is just a stat stick. Rogues and warriors on the other hand depend way more on having good melee weapons. So some will say it is unfair to have equal chance at them. Others will say it is still part of hunter BiS, so it is unfair if they should have an even harder time getting them. 
---
* Weighed BiS list. This is basically to solve the "problem" for melee in above example. A hunter can only roll on melee weapons if no melee class needs it and melee classes can only roll on ranged if no hunter needs it. Of course there are other examples of this too, it isn't just hunters vs melee. In general, this is one big mess, because who is to decide how much weighing is to be made in favour of classes in regard to items? Mostly, people will just pick whatever gives them the most items.
---
* Weighed classes. Yes, this is honestly a thing - if you play unviable specs, you can't roll for it unless no one else needs it. So as a balance druid you can't roll for an item a mage needs because you are a "meme spec". The mage will get more "dps" out of the item, therefor they should get it rather than you. This is mostly seen in guild raids that tries to optimize overall raid performance, but I have seen it done in PuG where it doesn't even make sense. You can't optimise a group for the future if you will never play together again, but some people will say anything to get their loot.
---
The first two are probably the biggest problems. Both are totally valid points, but they favour different people. This means when those different type of people join together, one have to "give up" the chance of some loot.
---
I know this is about loot distribution, not ninja looting directly, but the thing is - you need to follow rules of loot distribution and to ninja means you ignoring those rules. Since people have different rules it means what one consider being a ninja, another think is fair game.
---
I think ninja looting is mostly a problem in PuG where people all bring their own ruleset. In a guild there is a ruleset, and if you don't like it you can leave. Of course you can also have a ninja in a raid, but those are mostly obvious forms of ninja, like ignoring a DKP system and just walk over and take everything. No one disagree about this kind of ninja looting.
---
No it wasn't.
---
Invincibility
---
This is asshole advice if the guy wants to play a meme spec. Don't recommend people to play memespecs if they are not informed on the struggle.
---
It's like saying  "You should totally get a dog if you're not sure if you can feed it or take it for a walk every day". Fuck that  man.
---
Classic Frost-Mage because of the awesome Rotation:
---
FroboFroboFroboFroboFroboFroboFroboFroboFroboFroboFroboFrobo...
---
This is pure poetry from the heart
---
Unless you are grouped, screw him if he's not happy that you are willing to share. He would probably do the same thing to you, if you were fighting a mob.
---
Well I like to heal, and priests are pretty awesome at that, and shadow for a bonus PvP spec is outstanding
---
hold up is the nicker coming to classic wow?
---
If you're making it aware who has priority on items, you should be surprised if you're turned down for an item (i.e. a druid asking for DFT when you heal) or the same where you have pecking orders of class A &gt; class B &gt; class C.
---
If you sacc pre hellfire it soaks up the self dmg.
---
Put it set to stay and let it die whilst you flee.
---
I really hope you like healing or people laughing at you if you don’t.
---
Mmm that's more along the lines of reading comprehension.  Sorry my haha offended you.
---
yes you can use it in combat as a vanish, i think it has a 1 hr cd though
---
Winning a roll is *exactly* entitlement. Before rolling you are not entitled, but if everyone agree to roll for an item and someone wins the roll, that roll just made them entitled to the item.
---
Reasons why I don’t have a dog. Or children.
---
It depends what you play for. If a warden staff drops and you win a greed roll and gift it to the druid (and they intend to tank) then they'll remember you forever
---
I think there's something to be said for how indecisive a lot of people are. Every class is incredibly unique and fun in this version, so the "grass is greener" syndrome is in full effect :p  
---
I'll be playing druid, and it might seem like the obvious answer but the flexibility of shapeshifting is so cool to me. I visualize it like a branch, every enemy action can be answered with a multitude of reactions, so no fight is ever the same, where I see some of the other classes as more rigid in their responses.
---
do you have to be a tailor to equip it? or can you have tailoring on an alt and still use it?
---
BoK is the 11 point protection talent, but most ret paladins will have that.
---
Holy paladins might have it, too, although a fair chunk of them go Holy/Ret so they can get imp judgement and Seal of Command for farming.
---
The “correct” answers have been known for years. Anyone who is serious about their performance enough to mix max classic and followhroigh with it, cares enough to source the information themselves, as opposed to asking the id of reddit. 
---
Everyone I know who has been successful and a big min maxer, my self included, has put in their own effort to understand the systems well enough to fact check any guide they look at, they grind the numbers themselves. Asking reddit, is the opposite of that. 
---
So ya, 15 years after the fact, if you’re asking message boards instead of google, a spreadsheet, YouTube the. You’re supremely lazy. 
---
And for you, min maxing your race won’t matter. 
---
(My “you’s” aren’t meant at you in particular)
---
This really is a larger meta-forum problem. On the one hand you're right, for regular forum dwellers, answering the same questions over and over again to newcomers gets exhausting and people start getting hostile to newcomers. On the other hand, forum search capabilities uniformly are trash. I try to keep that in mind whenever we see the same question over and over again, it's probably somebody who just heard about Classic WoW for the first time and is coming here all full of hype, why would I expect them to search forum history when forum search is garbage?
---
It really is. I always got the feeling that everyone secretly wanted to be a druid. My friends and I were sorta jealous when one of the group actually did roll a druid and just owned in arenas during tbc.
---
I’d argue the issue is we’ve got 15 years of random posts to sift through, and 3 versions of WoW: classic, pserver, and retail.  How good an answer you get depends on how whether the page was tagged correctly, and even in this subreddit there is plenty of misinformation.
---
Please stop gatekeeping.
---
Yeah early on :D
---
&gt;exact same skill level
---
Get better.
---
I'm not entirely sure, I thought Mortal Strike was based on weapon damage top end and Bloodthirst was based on AP. Maybe someone can explain it to us
---
&gt; if I were the rogue/shaman in question I'd be fucking pissed knowing that warrior is gnna replace that with the first blue +str mail pants they find
---
Unless you're Alliance, the first BoP +str blue mail leggings are scarlet leggings at level 38.
---
A item is ninja looted if...
---
1. ...the item is master looted without predefined rules being upheld in regards to it dropping. (i.e. a binding drops and it is given to a hunter. this is both unexpected and not made a rule of item drops before joining or starting the raid... unless it was a rule, lol)
---
2. ...the item is need rolled by somebody who...
---
     a. ...cant use it and is not an enchanter.
---
     b. ...cant use it and is an enchanter while others can use it and want it. (this should still be cleared with the group beforehand)
---
     c. ...can use it but is not an upgrade. (this can be a gray area as some people might not know what is and isnt an upgrade)
---
    d. ...can use it, is an upgrade, but isnt their main spec. (this one should also be cleared with by the group but should likely be ignored for leveling dungeons since people need to level too)
---
These are generally the things that I would consider ninja looting but all in all, if your joining a group you should make it clear whether or not your going to be rolling on out of the expected items. This is a matter of common courtesy of the group amongst yourselves. If you think that an item you are going to roll on will be controversial, make it clear that you plan to roll on it before doing so.
---
Nice addition for a private residence.
---
Good gawd the materials! 10xmooncloth alone requires full month if you do it alone just when the cd resets.
---
Seconding this. Our tanks and healers would fight for the improved imp warlock to get a raid slot.
---
OP has left the chat
---
It means 40s for all players since you get it in ZF.
---
I fell for /camp one time. Never again lol
---
I like the Wumbo combo
---
my mine is my mine, your mine is also mine.
---
It can, this is more of a guideline regardless. I choose ClassicBiS because it lets you grab all of the data and phase data at once. I'm hoping people will give me some constructive feedback on what needs to be changed to get the most accurate list I can.
---
Rogues are a blast, stealth cannot be praised enough.  Simply stealing herb/mines from other players while you sap them brings tons of gratification. Are the kings of Wpvp. A few fun things to do as a rogue that take little effort is:
---
1. Chill in Blackrock mountain and distract players running on the twisting chains into the lava, never gets old
---
2. Find mages that are aoe farming and throw a cheap shot, gouge, kidney at them so the huge wave of enemies catch up and pummel them to death. 
---
Possibilities are endless, your imagination is the limit
---
Grrr
---
I was actually setting up this exact loot system and created the spreadsheet on google docs for my guild. You got it from the guild “Onslaught “ right? 
---
I’d be happy to share what I have and explain how it works. We added some extra ways to get a boost in priority through donations and performance. Donations are capped at 100g and reset every 5 weeks. Donating 100g will get you 100% of the points which we set at ~ 1.5-2 raids worth of attendance points netting about a +1-2 value for the actual list. Performance was also cycled every 5 weeks and people were chosen for how they preformed in the previous 5 weeks. Top 1 tank, 2 healers and 4 DPS. Performance points amounted to the same as a max donation (1-2 weeks of attendance points.
---
Unfortunately, my guild voted against this system citing:
---
1. People don’t want to fill out a spreadsheet to play the game.
---
2. What happens if someone for their MC/BWL list just stacks MC gear at the top and dips to another guild when BWL comes out?
---
3. They think people would be discouraged from raiding if they looked at the list and realized they were low in priority for most of their items.
---
4. They think most people would have similar lists so a core guildmember who missed one week of attendance points would get screwed to another guy who just showed up.
---
I don’t agree with all their concerns but it is what it is and now we switched to loot council with the RC loot council addon.

It's stupid good, better the longer you go without raiding or getting lucky on raid drops.
---
I am willing to raid with the most meme raid composition possible.  Would probably be an interesting challenge.
---
Well that's still just completely wrong. Optimal opener after you get Rake is Rake -&gt; Claw -&gt; 2 CP Rip -&gt; Claw to death. You get rip at like 24, Get FB at 32 which you will 100% use, and you can even use Tiger's Fury while leveling if you want, again at 24. Can do Ravage out of stealth too starting at 32. Faerie Fire (Feral) at 30 if rushing Deep Feral. All of these buttons you will use, with a lot of good situational buttons.
---
"Half the class' levels" is just a complete falsehood. This isn't even considering that you will HoT yourself pre pull, and if Tauren you can War Stomp -&gt; Heals mid combat when multipulling. You also get meaningful buffs, something a lot of other classes cannot say. 
---
You might not enjoy the class, but to say it's "only one button" is just spreading misinformation.
---
If in a group, roll. If solo, troll.
---
Rogue/mage for solo lulz, probably
---
You must be confused, rogues only listen to "Let The Bodies Hit The Floor" on repeat while ganking lowbies.
---
You're right, but people need to help themselves sometimes. I'm a complete noob to WoW but i havent asked a single question on this sub, because i've found everything by myself with simple google/youtube searches.
---
Pets always had laggy response times to commands in classic. I remember it clearly because I always had to watch for patrols and call my pet back way ahead of time to avoid it body pulling.
---
Loot council sounds terrible.  Sounds like a system for guild leaders to gear themselves out at the expense of everyone else—I’ve played waaay to much eve online to trust people with that power.  I used DKP with decay in vanilla and hope to find a guild that does something similar again.
---
Except for paladin buffs, which are class related. Ie greater might affects all warriors in the raid regardless of party.
---
gotta wait until last to roll, see how the dice fall
---
Probably mage, their utility is extremely high in PvP
---
“Nah you’re just wrong.” You’ve already proven my point before i’ve even made it. 
---
Moving onto what you say about Blood Elves being Disney versions of themselves... I strongly disagree with you there. Blood elves in WoW have almost always taken themselves seriously apart from when you type /Silly. I would love for you to give me some examples of them being ‘Disney villains’ because in TBC the schism of the Blood elves between following Kael/Lor’themar/or Kael’s followers defecting to Shattrath with Liadrin was some great lore. And regardless of that Warcraft has never taken itself 100% seriously (not even the movie did). Warcraft is littered with humour and jokes you just need to spam click a unit to see that. 
---
Adding a huge lore important race to a game has in no way made the game a shadow of itself and you know that. The gameplay and game systems did that - don’t be silly.  
---
Also Belves on the Horde make perfect sense imo. Sylvanas was previously a high elf of Quel’thalas and a high ranking ranger but is now a leader of the horde and close to them geographically. There are so many factors as to why the Belves relationship with the Horde made for great story telling. If your defence is, ‘the Belves are too pretty for the horde’, you aren’t paying attention.
---
Especially for copper. Just move on to the next 100 nodes

Hey there, I came across the Classic WoW 5-man Leveling Guide by Hakurai and would like to do something like that. I played from early BC to WotLK and now am a legend dad (Hearthstone), excited to play Classic. Dungeon leveling would be only once a week, but reliable. Contact me via PM. Greetings, Mosar
---
Yeah, it looks like their "stages" don't line up with the phases exactly. Stage 1 is pre-raid, fine, but the BiS weapon listed for feral druids is a DM drop.
---
It's bop, you have to level tailoring on the character that will make and wear it. You do not have to keep tailoring after you make it to equip it.
---
Your age doesn't matter, pick what speaks to you.
---
It can be doable, I got a wolf for my tauren at level 40 or 41 back in the day.
---
Lmfao
---
I've heard when they lvl up children start to fend for themselves, but I've yet to see it. Tried a couple times and ended rerolling, too much micromanagement needed
---
Highest skill cap would probably be shaman or warlock. It's crazy what those classes can do in the hands of a competent player.
---
Sounds like Druid to me.
---
AV won't be in the game till phase 3.
---
If you're a healer, you can make decent money chaining dungeons.  You'll probably get a lot of orbs just running live strath just for the truefaith pattern.
---
Both sets of data are skewed. His estimate assumes a player base of 5k+ (I'm guessing) and players online 24 hours a day. I doubt either number is perfect but like you said initially, both, "[Give] a good estimate." 
---
IMO, to think one is better than another is pretty egotistical.
---
If a hunter needs a MH for their main spec, I don't see how a rogue/warrior needing a hunter weapon is different. I think it boils down to "is it an upgrade", stat stick or not. If someone needed on it then immediately DEs is when it becomes an issue
---
Get a cheap 4k monitor for the same price.  You only need high refresh rates in fps games like csgo.
---
Make sure you have a loot system in place early, and explain what you'll be doing so there aren't any questions come raid time.
---
No way bro, you want all healers to only need only healing gear while leveling and all tanks to only roll on stamina gear? You're mad
---
This is on the dot about the Min-Maxers. They get on 2-3 hours early to get buffed and they have 0 life.
---
And Floyd as well. This guy must work for the NSA.
---
Just like with all nodes; first come, first serve. If I'm clearing a mob and someone jacks the node out from under me, welp, them's the breaks. It's not like you need to camp a respawn for hours or anything.
---
I can support this **but only if Karazhan gets added to classic**. Karazhan, like Hyjal, got pushed to later expansions since as it was a bit excessive, but I feel like it there would absolutely be room for it in Classic WOW.
---
Their animations and their models. Disney is an animation...
---
I didn't pay attention to their lore in-game, so you may be right.
---
But not only are they too pretty for the horde, they're too pretty for what they actually look like. 
---
But so are Night Elves, but that kinda works since they're Alliance.
---
By the time that set is released alot of guilds will be clearing mc in just over 30 minutes to an hour. How can you not have time
---
Didn’t know my rogue stealth bar was a new action page. Tossed all my stealth abilities on the right action bar and clicked for months before realizing
---
Sorry they shot the system down. But we have it all pretty much wrapped up with a bow on it at this point. We locked out the top 5 tiers behind certain objectives (10 consecutive raids attended, full consumes, full enchants, class knowledge demonstration, class quest (jokey)) each task rewards a better tier loot. No one wants to give money for better loot order so we didn't go that route.
---
And the big one since everyone can see everyone else loot list: encouraging people to switch the loot priority to accommodate other guildies (you get tier 2 piece of I get brutality blade).
---
39 is where it's at!
---
Warlock
---
-Free mount
---
-If you aren't raiding or doing anything hardcore you don't need many soulshards, one for pet and one for healthstones and one for soulstone
---
-Free pet at level 2

-Free tanking pet at level 10
---
-Pets don't require ANY maintenance aside from training at an NPC

-Literally can never run oom because of spirit tap + health drain
---
Not really, it’s so irrelevant those legs at the end of the day when you specifically get a quest for blue leather leggings that are way better at 30. It won’t make or break ur leveling, and they are just as good for a warrior than any other class who can use them. Besides, if you can replace them with a generic mail leggings then you can replace them with generic leather leggings.
---
99% of the people on this sub that make a guide, tutorial, or spreadsheet are not getting paid for it nor do they expect to be.
---
You're just plain wrong.
---
My first character was a rogue. And I was determined to get the defia gear set from deadmines. And the dagger from gnomeregan and shadowfang. Which I managed to achieve but not till after level 30... I put hours and hours into this goal and thought I was bad ass when I did... a day later I realized I was an idiot as there were plenty of better gear to be had at my level.
---
Stoped playing the rogue and rolled an undead warlock that became my main
---
You guys are forgetting that true faith also looks amazing and fits the priest theme to a T. Compared to the strat robes which are great but look terrible.
---
In 2005 I was 12 years old and playing a Night Elf Druid because I thought it was really cool being a bear so I wanted to be a bear. I finished teldrassil and got to Darkshore. 
---
At this point I decided I hated questing (likely because my only other MMO experience was FFXI) so I decided to grind the crabs on the shore. I did this from level 11(?) to 18. I single handedly caused a crab shortage in Darnassus.
---
All buffs are group only except the paladin greater blessings which are class based. This also includes AoE abilities like prayer of healing, holy nova and tranquility so you have space out your AoE healers into several groups. Same can be said with shaman totems where traditionally mid-fight the raid leader or someone with assist would switch shamans in and out of priest groups to drop mana tide.
---
Yeah, neither one is perfect. But two imperfect data points are better than one!
---
Any reason to not include the meme-specs (or whatever the PC way to refer to shadow, feral, balance, etc. is)? With all the posts regarding feral DPS specifically, I'd love to see those on the sheet.
---
Definitely rogue/mage/hunter
---
You must have missed my post where I said you get your first finisher at 24.
---
I would offer it at a reduced cost. If it's a full-guild run I would think differently, but in pugs your main objective isnt to upgrade the raid.
---
sorry I don't know any alternatives :(
---
Try telling that to the rogue. If I'm on my Priest and some idiot hunter rolls on Robes of Arugal, I'm going to be pissed. Seeing him put it on doesn't change the fact he's a ninja.
---
Youre getting downvotes because nef and ony cast their fear at a rate much faster than your berserker rage cd. There is no way you are dancing every fear on Nef/Ony. I think you are lying.
---
When i my now main human back in TBC i wanted a saber mount. So i had to do the run in reverse. Which argualbly is worse since you can't do the graveyard skips
---
Dragging demons to low level areas and letting then loose.. Mmm...
---
It's been a long time since I played WoW, especially my Hunter. But AFAIK, I do think that works.
---
night elf for a warrior is nice, shadowmeld great for pvp (whether just hiding while semi-afk, or ambushing someone), increase dodge chance always welcome for tanking, nature resist is mildly handy for some endgame raid resist, and since you will die a lot the wisp form is tasty
---
also flip chance on jump
---
Being a good hunter in wpvp takes a lot of skill.
---
Shut the fuck up, edgy kid
---
For raid leading, if you want something simple in order to keep mental bandwidth for leading, warlock and mage are both a 1 button rotation and for the most part you don't have to worry about anything else except the occasional lifetap or mana gem/evocation.
---
Healer may be a little harder, but honestly you generally as a healer pay attention to so much that you probably notice more things in a raid than a typical DPS (many whom don't even put raidframes up on screen).
---
So an ability will reset the auto shot timer?
---
Okay, but to say "first 24 levels" are half of your character is just silly. First 10 levels for anyone are going to be meh, and Druid will have just as many buttons. You could argue Bear is boring, sure, but 10-20 is not a long period of time compared to the large amount of time it'll take from 25-60 (leveling isn't linear). Even then, you still have heals/cc/buffs. Bear still gets Enrage which is SO much better than rolling warrior since at least you can build rage.  
---
Mage is basically only Frostbolt for the vast majority of leveling, Rogue is going to be SS, Paladin is auto attack city, etc. It's just disingenuous to say Druid is lacking in buttons just because they use "few" buttons from 10-24. Also you have your first finisher at 20, just no point using it because of energy regen timing.
---
If you are min-maxing, you'd want both Smoking Heart and the Mara trinket... both are ideal for different situations. Neither are really upgraded until you can beg your guild to give you Drake Fang Talisman.
---
How do you leave the instance in order to do it 5 times an hour?
---
When I read about them tiptoeing around enjoying their hobbies to avoid displeasing their SOs, I can't help but think they are in a really unhealthy/toxic relationship with what sounds like a control freak, and I feel bad for them. Relationships shouldn't mean you have to walk on eggshells when it comes to enjoying your hobbies.
---
I dont know the specifics, but certain pally buffs benefit you more, and windfury on the horde does not do anything for you, which is silly imo but thats how it was.
---
If you are getting 1 out of 6 nodes, then the other guy can fuck right off. It's an MMORPG, sharing the non instanced world is part of the deal, no negotiations accepted. You don't get to "claim" your own part of the world because you want to casually grind resources while ripping your dab pen. People need to learn to share, or they can pound sand.
---
If this were EJ, you would be banned.
---
Rad! Any cool macros you want to share? I joined the classic warlock discord and have been compiling general useful stuff but I'd love to see what you're working on.  
---
Are you levelling affliction eventually going SM/Ruin too?
---
I love the idea of party buffs. Excellent idea thanks!
---
Here is the etiquette. If you mine it you get the resources. If you don’t mine it, you don’t get the resources.
---
Lawful Good - Don’t mine, get a new profession
---
Neutral Good - What you did
---
Chaotic Good - Mine let someone get the node next time
---
Lawful Neutral - Mine that node every other time
---
True Neutral - Don’t care
---
Chaotic Neutral - Mine when you feel like it, don’t when you don’t
---
Lawful Evil - Mine every node because it helps your character progress
---
Neutral Evil - Mine every node because you got to it first
---
Chaotic Evil - Fuck that guy, my node now
---
While I don't know about that, 2.4.3 TBC has you sac your succubus and spam Shadowbolt. SWP had many a guild poach dozens of warlocks to deal their insane Shadow damage.
---
As a Mage I was never a noob.
---
^(I)  ^(thought) ^(logging) ^(out) ^(in) ^(inns) ^(was) ^(required.)
---
Something something alt tab to pornhub something something
---
I actually plan to farm resist gear for every encounter, at least 250 resist for all schools of magic.
---
The beautiful thing with hunter is that you can just FD into swapping gear midfight. This is all theorycrafting so in all honesty I don't know if the dps-loss is worth the damage-mitigation. 
---
The things that we hunters have going for us is that we don't scale too well with gear anyway so swapping to some resist doesn't gimp our damage as much as with other classes and we can also fatigue our opponent with viper sting and pet damage. I'm dying to try it all out but it's gonna be a while 'til I get the chance and farm all the necessary resist-gear.
---
A good starting point is buying the Radiant Mail-set which has both Shadow Resist and Frost Resist in one.
---
For Nature Resist you can just farm all the gear from Maraudon, which you will need for AQ40 anyway.
---
Actually, truefaith IS the significant upgrade for holy priests. Other than this chest, there isn't much else to spent gold on to get such an advantage.
---
Ret priority looks right to me.

The way I heard it, drood is for fite.

**&lt;Nebula&gt; - Semi-Hardcore**
---
(EU PVP Alliance)
---
**About Us:**
---
Nebula began as a small group of friends, some of who have lived the vanilla experience given to us in 2004, some of us haven’t. Some of us hardcore, some are not.
---
Yet the main goal for all of us is the same. This is a game we are super excited about launch and simply put can’t wait for the fun times ahead. We are a group of adults, 
---
from each corner of Europe. We love banter and a good atmosphere.
---
Guild reputation is important to us. So, whether your jam is smashing skulls in AV, grinding Timbermaw rep or competing with us in end game content, Nebula would be happy to host your stay. We also foster a very active Discord which has grown steadily along with the build up towards launch in August!
---
Our philosophy is: **For the guild, not a person.**
---
**Our Goals:**
---
Straight up raiding. Our ranks include many highly experienced players who have spent 14 years raiding on wow. Our raiding environment will be serious, yet positive and enthusiastic. 
---
If raiding isn’t your jam, our ranks also include many socials/ pvpers who are here for ride! 
---
**Raid Times:**
---
Wednesday + Thursday + Sunday 18:45 - 22:30 BST (or 19:45 - 23:30 EU server time). 
---
**Recruitment:**
---
We are now recruiting for the last few slots for our raiding roster:
---
Mage x 1
---
Resto Druid x 1
---
Warlock x 1 (with Class Leader role available for those interested)
---
We are also recruiting social members to come join us on our adventures in Azeroth!
---
**Application:**
---
Please apply via this link: https://www.guilded.gg/r/EnNEavPo4j?i=x4oZnqGA.
---
Or contact Shane#2310, Zyepox#1969, Ethario#1412 or Nakkie#3039 on Discord.
---
One of my favorite things I've seen so far is people talking about how the community was super helpful in Classic then also seeing people in here lose their shit over answering similar questions.
---
Not hating, just thought it was kind of funny.
---
I main rogue always just because I love the way a geared rogue looks more than anyone, and I feel like no one makes pvp look as orchestrated like a rogue can. I really feel like I'm given all the tools I need to succeed, and it's entirely on me to use them correctly.
---
Rogue is just one of those classes that, if you excel at, you really stand out over other rogues and people seem to really notice it.
---
I get to look down on the Peons and lesser classes as they struggle to find transportation to major cities.
---
Choker is not replaced in BWL for mages.
---
TOEP is not replaced in BWL for mages- they get another damage trinket, but it has a much longer CD and is useful for different kinds of fights- it would be much more accurate to say TOEP is replaced in naxx by restrained essence of sapphiron.
---
Mara trink and Smoking Heart are both BIS in different tanking situations.
---
But i'm special i deserve to be answered personally
---
Those people are idiots that need to be ignored. No vanilla private server went dead before 2-3 years into the servers lifespan... Then they release a fresh pserver and all those people start all over again and play for another 3 years, servers full.
---
Rogue if you have certain talents specc'd or have your cooldowns can get out of ton of situations with clever use of CC and vanish.
---
But, they are super squishy when you try to overextend or get stunned.
---
Melee hunter

I’m waiting for the press release that they “retuned” the game.
---
Austrian.
---
That and free healthcare
---
I'm going to main a NE feral druid for leveling and I'm curious what you fine folks think I should take for my two professions.
---
I'm thinking skinning/mining but also considering skinning/herbalism, because I have this nagging feeling that I remember mining nodes being rare in the early NE zones.
---
Thoughts?
---
Mind Control. Literally just mind control. I heard Naxxramas had a boss fight in which you had to tank the boss with mind controlled mobs and I was like: Sold.
---
I rerolled Priest and once I hit 30 I could not be stopped. I mind controlled anything and everything. Murlocs at Crystal Lake? They look funny when you make them run backwards. Hogger? He spams dialogue when you make him jump. Battlemages in Strat Scarlet Side? They have one thousand damage blastwaves. Loremasters in Black Fathom Depths? They can buff an ally with bonus physical damage and it makes HILARIOUS crits possible.
---
She never made it into Naxx40, not surprising, but during Burning Crusade I played as Shadow and I used Mind Control as a form of CC in heroics. It took a lot of convincing that this was a reliable source of CC not just for one mob but 2, because your expendable Mind Control Bot could off-tank all it wanted, but I was a regular in people's daily heroic runs because they loved the novelty of it. Also, Burning Crusade era mobs? They do mad dps.
---
When WotLK happened I finally realised my dream. Naxx25 came along and I was always on the front lines for the Instructor Razuvious, I was Queen of Mind Control and I was ready.
---
Cat animation better alliance, thus more viable (stands to reason)
---
Yeah, the dodge passive is better than hp, but mostly it's kings(good for ferals) vs windfury(does nothing for you).
---
Wow, a non loot whore hunter. So rare, so beautiful
---
I started playing very, very early in closed beta, when the game was still using the skill point system. I was playing an orc warrior and I found a green 2-handed sword, the first green weapon I had found. However, as it was a sword, I had to go to Undercity to learn 2-handed sword proficiency, which cost more skill points than I had. I was like 11 at the time and the skill point system was mostly over my head, so I didn't really have a good understanding of how to get more, so my solution was to just farm tigers on the Echo Isles until I had enough. I was like level 13 at the time and it took me like a day and a half since I was getting next to no xp from those level ~8 mobs. I felt like an idiot when I found out later that the easiest way to get more was to just level up, and I felt like an even bigger idiot when I replaced that shitty sword like 3 quests in the Barrens later.
---
Thinking about this just makes me all the more glad they canned the old skill point system and just made weapon skills and stuff cost money. Ended up so much better.
---
WF also doesn't proc in bear form.  Horde side you can eek out more AP with GoA/SoE vs blessing of might, but that's about it. yeah.
---
I never said edge, I said they can still win if skilled.
---
Just after creating my first character back in 2005, a Night Elf Rogue, I managed to throw myself off the edge of Teldrassil and into the water. I didn't know about the HS so I spent my first hour in-game swimming around the whole damn island before eventually arriving in Darnassus.
---
Also very much more well educated than any of the “me smash, gib sheeld” classes.
---
When I ran 40 man raids we used spreadsheet at first, then a DKP addon that kept trade of raid attendance.
---
Enchanting to 265 isn't actually that expensive anyway compared to leveling to 300. The mats for smoking heart will cost more than the leveling.
---
I'd argue that feral *tank* is more valuable on Horde, since threat matters more without Salv. However, Horde bears suffer from lack of fear ward *and* from lack of windfury. They may still outthread windfuried warriors, but when they have to do damage, the relative DPS suffers.
---
fFear ward is 30 second cd lasts 10 mins.  Can buff your entire 10 man premade before wsg starts.  It's game changing in pvp not qol.
---
Nice work on the lists.  
---
For AQ you seem to be missing Belt of Never-ending Agony - it is BiS for sword rogues. Dagger rogues will eventually want T3 belt to keep Aged Core Leather Gloves &amp; T3 set bonus.
---
Plus that wolf is learned at 20. 20 levels before mounts. Plus it's a 1second cast time if you spec it. Plus rogues cant sap you in it because you are no longer a humanoid. Plus the spam /sit is top notch bad-mouthing.
---
Pro-tip: Don't be a Guild Leader. Once the game starts to die down and people stop showing up and your guild is having trouble recruiting, you will be blamed for the guild dying and makes the game much less fun. 
---
Leave the classic part-time job to those who are experienced GLs with raiding guilds. 
---
Not that you can't. You have all the power to do so, just be careful not to ruin your fun while you're at it. It takes a lot of time, patience, and planning to have a decent guild because it's not all about raiding. People still want to have fun and do things in the world together.
---
Thank you for the catch, modified the Choker. I'll ask around about ToEP because on all the BiS lists I see it being replaced with MQG

**Incarnation** [A] | NA-PvP | Mon/Tues/Weds | 7-10 pm PST | Hardcore | loot council
---
Hi everyone!
---
&lt;Incarnation&gt; is a Hardcore Alliance guild looking for passionate and competitive players for Classic WoW. Our goal is to raid and clear content efficiently while promoting a healthy community. If you take the time to talk with us you'll see our passion and that we're taking this seriously.
---
We have a solid core group and are looking to add a few more exceptional players to our roster. Our leadership core contains the following: multiple top 20 KT kills, Rank 14, multi season gladiators, complete private server progression, and competitive world rankings in other games.
---
We do not expect all our recruits to have this level of experience, however we do have high expectations. All the information is out there, such as boss mechanics and dps rotations. Even those new to classes/specs will be held to a high standard. We expect before applying you research and understand the basic mechanics and rotations of the class you're applying for.
---
**Expectations:**
---
We're currently fine tuning our raids weekly to ensure once launch comes we progress with minimal delay. Incarnation has an in house instant 60 server we use to ensure every member exceeds standards. We expect our members to be knowledgeable about each encounter and have adequate consumables available for progression.

What I love about my class is the simpel fact that I can charge in, balls raging and bulging out my hard plate armor, Mortal Striking whatever the fuck happens to be in my way and absolutely one shotting that shit to the unliving depths of that which is only known to those who are dead.
---
Ya that's me.  I was going to post my thought, but I knew no one cared because everyone has already asked 1 million times which class to play.  I was gonna go Warlock, but then I saw a Punkrat video where high end guilds only use like 1 Warlock and 8 Mages 8-10 Warriors.  So now I'm conflicted and thinking about going Mage or Warrior.  Ultimately it doesn't matter, I'm just excited and have nothing else to do for the next month but think about what I'm going to do.
---
Yeah BGs were kinda bad for the games PvP back then I felt like. The world was much more lively and dangerous before BGs because everyone was trying to rank up by hunting and warring in the world.
---
Yet another day of someone complaining about this sub, how unique.
---
Yeah, that's true
---
It's downvoted but cause it's a popular opinion and a low effort karma farm. And spammed constantly
---
This is only for items that are contested with other classes. Belt of Never-ending Agony is only ever BiS for rogues so they will always have priority on it.
---
&gt; the faster everyone can move on to a low-quality meme or "Hey, has anyone thought of this highly-unique solution to layering yet!?" post that we all love so much.
---
This is a mod that understands his sub.
---
For healer+support: PI Disc Priest, as was mentioned earlier.
---
For dps+support: Warlock.
---
Tanks want your HP buff. Casters want your Curse of Elements. Melee dps wants your Curse of Recklessness. Everyone wants a Summon and a Soulstone. You have Banish for CC, Succubus pet for more CC. Voidwalker for offtanking and oh-shit tanking. Warlocks have a huge toolbox.
---
Alliance warlocks are on the rare side, too, so raids are often looking for more locks. Curse of Elements knocks the socks off of Nightfall.
---
WoW is unique from other MMOs of its age because there isn’t a pure support class.  Many games had bards and classes that made everyone better, but were generally useless on their own.
---
That said, most classes support the group in some way.  I’m assuming you want to know how each class makes others shine or provides a utility benefit.  Ranking them from best to worst and some examples:
---
Shaman - the ultimate buffer.  Totems make melee classes so strong and warriors/rogues will specifically seek you out because you make their gameplay more fun with windfury.
---
Paladin - Blessings and auras give potent passive buffs and are tailored for each class.
---
Druid - MotW is great, but not tailored to anyone specifically.  Thorns, fairie fire.  Innervate is clutch for priests and makes them shine.  Then spec specific things like leader of the pack and moonkin aura make everyone just a little more potent.
---
Warlock - curse of shadows/elements is a huge DPS boost to others.  Healthstone/soulstone. 
---
Priest - Fort buff, power infusion, spirit buff, shadow resist.  Generally passive and not as valued as other buffs, but priests are always an asset.
---
Mage - Water is huge, but people can buy their own ($$$).  Portals, remove curse, amp and damp magic.  Appeals to people who like to support but mages steal the limelight a bit themselves.
---
Hunter - Nature resist, 40% movement speed to the group, a few negligible pet buffs like wolf howl.  You can do neat tricks like taunting mobs into traps, but the hunter is a bit of a lone wolf.
---
Rogue - Crippling poison stops runners, stuns really lighten the damage load, hemorrhage makes melees hit a bit harder.  Overall the rogue tends to take more than give, but they are supportive in subtle ways.
---
Warrior - Battle shout.  ... yeah.  Again they can help in small ways but the warrior is a class that is great for divas who want all the attention.  They shine when they get support, they aren’t great about providing it.
---
You can see that generally hybrid healers are the best supports.  That is by design.  If you want to make everyone around you stronger, and be desired for it shaman is made for you.  This role becomes even more apparent in TBC with heroism/bloodlust where they become the uncontested king of support.  Still unconfirmed if that’s in the cards, but shamans are strong supports in all specs even without heroism/bloodlust.
---
Well first of all I like the gameplay of the warlock, using dots, drains, pets, CC and hard nukes. Very versatile and there are vastly different ways of playing them. It's also a very deep class because it has so many abilities. A conflag lock plays very differently to an SM/ruin lock or SL/NF and so on. Most classes only have one or two specs they can play. 
---
I also like the class fantasy of being this misfit genius whom society disapproves of. It connects a lot to myself, except the genius part heh. 
---
I like to think that my character was kicked out of mage college because he was asking questions that shouldn't be asked. If mages are the Jedi and the Burning Legion are the Sith, then warlocks are the Grey Jedi. Walking the line between good and evil, drawing power from both. Imo it's way harder to use the power of the corrupting and addictive fel magic while remaining sane and good, than not using it at all. In our minds the mages are simply not strong willed enough to dare trifle with such power. Or just a bunch of dogmatic and mindless magicians who go by the book instead of thinking for themselves.
---
A often over looked aspect that he mentions is the fact most people don’t trust other people enough to give them the officer powers required to help manage the guild properly so finding and building trust with your guild is soooo important!! If you don’t have enough management or sometimes too much management the guilds fall apart and making sure all officers stay on the same page for rules and discipline! No picking favs
---
its because of Paladins vs Shamans
---
You are so dam wrong. 
---
So paladins should just pass all healing gear thar isnt plate to priests and druids?
---
Leather pants can be just as much of an upgrade for a warrior or a rogue. Warriors and Paladins can wear all types of gear for a reason. They dont have to pass on upgrades just bc your class cant wear plate.
---
Out of curiosity what are you planning to use multiboxing for?  Is there a lot of benefit to having to separate characters you can play simultaneously?
---
Deep Frost Mage in mc/bwl
---
Channel your inner Payo.
---

---
Vanilla did not have BGs at launch. This is a good thing.
---
Make friends with a lw, give them all your skins to craft into whatever cheap greens they can, d/e for profit.
---
Kara attunement was running a few heroics and a short quest chain so that's not really that time consuming. Other attunements were just killing the previous raid tier's boss and a short quest chain so that's not really time consuming either. Just by doing dallies every so often you'd get enough gold for raiding, so aside from 8 hours a week of raiding (less than what many people spend a week watching netflix) all you really need to do is some dallies for gold. 4 hours on saturday and 4 hours on sunday and then a few hours over the course of the rest of the week isn't completely unreasonable.
---
You are still replacing that trinket by phase 2, where a melee is using that for much longer. So it is all so you can have 20 AP in phase 1. I just won't take any hunter to emp if they say they want HoJ. Simple.
---
Really solid. I appreciate the effort!!
---
just turned 20 in june. started playing in BC and stopped about 2 months after cata released. Excited to get to experience vanilla.
---
Also, every time someone asks the same question again, there's always a bit of extra information or context that I can find in that thread. It's not like there's a single set in stone answer to every question and there's always some ambiguity.
---
&gt;going to get toxic and shitty and hateful  
---
Nope, 1000% the personality of the players. Not everyone are vindictive little shits. Who cares if someone else is enjoying the game at their own pace? If you willingly join a group of friends to level and they're toxic and hateful towards you because you want to take your time to level, that's on you because you clearly know their personalities and that they would feel this way. 
---
People are acting like it's normal to be a sociopath -- it's not. Most people mind their own business and don't try to control or negatively affect what others do. 
---
&gt; People legitimately wouldn't allow shamans into groups 
---
Again, if you join a guild pushing current content who want you know what the best and are privy to min-maxing how can you be surprised that a class that has routinely been ignored and under-performing for 2 expansions, that shaman players themselves have been complaining about, is benched? This has nothing to do with the topic of guides.
---
I mean you're still get agi and str/dmg mitigation from other totems, as well as resists when applicable.  Blessing wins but it's not blessing or nothing.
---
It was the only race that could play pally....
---
I hate Belfs, but was forced to play them for my pally.
---
Mostly just for being a "clicker" and "keyboard turner". I think the only pc game I'd ever played before was runescape and before that was all console games. I'd only use my left hand for moving and jumping... then I moved on to using right hand to press spells on the number pad. I think eventually the game got more fast paced and I figured out how to play properly, saying that I do now use a mouse with 12 side buttons so i guess I'm still pretty rubbish. Good enough for wow classic though!
---
... no
---
People were skipping trash in dungeons all the way back in Vanilla.
---
I remember people used to require invis pots for scholo / brd runs to do them in 5 minutes.
---
This, Heart might not be better over Mark of Chosen end game but it will help A LOT with armor amount gearing up, and think every tanking druid should try and get it.
---
You cant find anything on the topic? Forgive me but have you even tried typing anything in on the search bar for this subreddit, YouTube or Google? This is quite possibly the most discussed thing on the subreddit and you couldn't find anything?
---
At age 13 in 2005 on my first character I got to level 30 as a warrior without knowing that spec points/trees existed; it took me a long time to get to 30. By that point, I had already given up on playing that warrior and started playing a rogue, and while playing on that character I was later informed about the existence of the specialization tree. My first warrior was such a traumatic experience I never tried playing that class again.
---
As a more casual player I think tailoring would be more value as you could craft bloodvine and other pieces of gear that you would otherwise not be able to achieve without raiding. Nelf zone has a good amount of ore.
---
Someone feel free to correct me if I'm wrong but: I don't think warriors generate rage from dodging?
---
Not that taking Nelf is bad or whatever, it's just useful to know.
---
He prefaces the entire post with saying he's only referring to T1.
---
AQ came like 14 months after release in vanilla, so yes it should come over a year after Classic launch. You are also clearly not familiar with private servers if you think that would make the game go dead, those pservers stay full for easy 2-3 years.
---
PvP was better before BGs. No need to hurry with them.
---
Your first sentence isn’t true, and you basically acknowledge that it isn’t true in the next sentence. True faith is better for a lot of situations. I’d say true faith is better overall and t2 is a sidegrade. It probably comes down to personal preference though. Mana per 5 is OP as fuck in vanilla for priests
---
Mark of the chosen's proc rate is pretty accurate given that the trinket tells you exactly what it is (2% every time you get hit).
---
I didn't take into account each race combination because shit starts getting really weird trying to balance the list with Humans and Orcs in the mix. But in that regard I'd def agree.
---
It's funny because most of those questions only make sense from a powergamming / e-sport min/max perspective... And in WoW Classic, 99% of the game is not about powergamming and min/maxing.
---
Not necessarily disagreeing but would you really consider Druid to have a high skill ceiling? I didn't play one in vanilla but been playing on pservers a bit and researching the class alot because I plan to play it but they don't seem to have too many buttons to press or strats to follow. Doesn't it often devolve into sitting in bear or popping hots/dots and kiting etc.
---
I feel like their smartest plays are just hibernating or popping abolish poison etc
---
Soul link warlocks are legitimate tanks.
---
&gt;Second trinket you've linked isn't available in the 1st phase
---
can you please provide me a citation for this somewhere? I'm running with the expectation that all Thorium Brotherhood and Revantusk Village content is open on day one. The only source I have is [this](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-content-plan/120346) that the blues put out a while ago.

---
Yeah it really doesn’t matter unless your guild is cutting edge, and let’s be honest, as much as everybody likes to RP like they’re in Method or some shit most guilds won’t be cutting edge.
---
&gt;Rune of the Guard Captain is Phase 3
---
No reason to ruin it by doing that, since the playerbase is not really the same at all. People who play Classic aren't going to go to retail no matter what.

If I'm going to be starring at a butt all day, I'd rather it be female.

He's right, Mages just rotate trinkets and use them in different kind of fights.  
---
Neltharion's Tear is fixed and then it's MQG/ToEP/ZHC depending on the fight. When you acquire REoS it makes ToEP/ZHC obsolete.
---
Wisp is so conflicting as an old nelf rogue when raiding.
---
You die first because you suck at dodging.
---
You release as soon as the call is made.
---
You ress first because of wisp (BRM runs especially).
---
You have regenerated to full hp before the healers have ressed the first lazy asshole that didn't want to run. 
---
Now you sit and stare for another 5 minutes before the ready-check shows we're missing 5 people.
---
Might as well run longer.
---
Both are bad advice and people give it because it comforts the asker.
---
tauren warstomp is really powerful (if you dont raid 100% of the time)
---
I said I can't find anything good. The link the other person gave me seems pretty nice though
---
i think thats correct, no rage on dodge
---
i'd say getting a lucky dodge at the right time outweighs being rage starved because of an "unlucky" dodge
---
Has Blizzard made *any* mention of the layering bugs that popped up time and time again in beta?
---
US, PvP, HORDE - Hardcore dungeon leveling 
---
I’m looking for a dungeon grind group, I’ll be available all week starting at launch and looking to hit 60 in that timespan. 
---
I’ll be rolling mage, so I’m open to spellcleave groups, but additionally I’m also willing to participate in a melee cleave group since there should still be downtime to drink.
---
I would start over from level 1 whenever I wasnt happy with some talent choice. Full on delete character and start over. I didnt know I could pay to respec.
---
😂
---
Charge in with headbleed and no worries and going ham.
---
Watched a video and people said blessings of kings is a huge boost for feral druids since they’re mostly stacking stats and dodge. Unlike most tanks that are stacking defense this helps gives a threat boost, additional health, and dodge with my agility by boosting all the stamina, agility and strength
---
Ƨ\
---
I think every druid guide ive seen mentions you should always get the tanking trinket reguardless cuz that trinket is THE best tanking trinket for druids while the dps trinket is only like the 4th, 5th best one.
---
So do we get a key ring or not. I’ve heard both over and over again
---
It's worth putting it on if you get advance warning and you have the gear on hand. Is it worth filling in your bags for the chance that you might run into a warlock or shadow priest?
---
Probably not.
---
Although I'd take it to BGs.
---
And if your flavor of world pvp is ganking, and not walking around doing stuff and killing alliance in the meanwhile, it's probably still worth it since you need the bagspace less.
---
The lei isn’t even better than benediction until (I believe) you can get that gavel from AQ40 rep.
---
Nah just don’t know why this would bother someone so much.
---
and now I know what class i am playing, thanks
---
I mean, he's not wrong though. You'd be hard pressed to think of something that hasn't been asked already, especially if you're a new player. People are just lazy.
---
I love Priests for many reason. First and foremost is the super cool Shadowform. Yes I am an Spriest at heart. They also have amazing healing spells so you can focus on Shadow while leveling and still heal dungeons just fine (out of Shadowform of course). They are basically this "I'm weak and only good at healing and dispelling somewhat" type of class with a hidden dark side that can just wreck you if they deem fit.  
---
There is also, of course, Mind Control. Nothing like taking control of some other player's character that they worked so hard to get to where they are, then you just take control and make em jump off a cliff. Really disorienting for the target too. Not to mention the sweet raid mechanic in Naxx where you need a priest to MC and tank :P
---
Knowing when to switch forms, keeping your moves straight in each form, understanding that each fight will be a patient affair, not able to rely on burst damage unless moonkin, and then adding all that together in different ways to deal with each other class. I never played one but it just seemed overwhelming to me.
---
Jin'do was better as a Druid since they are immune to polymorph effects. I don't think many others were better as a Druid, but they were viable. Patchwork a Druid was fine as the off tank, but he hit too hard to tank all the shots, avoidence was needed.
---
I'd like to play the same way I do now – as a rogue, and occasionally. Looking to run questlines in fun zones, an instance or two, etc., and hoping that classic forces more grouping like we had to do back in the day, instead of the \_insane\_ pace that people instance now via group finder, sprinting through an instance at breakneck pace, not talking, and immediately porting out at the end never to be seen again.
---
This is an excellent question, and I believe Nightfall will be released in Phase 3 with BWL. This is one of the frustrating aspects of many guides which include items from Dire Maul which will not be released until Phase 2 so keep an eye out for guides listing DM gear as well. Very frustrating when people list enchanted thorium as good pre-raid bis gear.
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19169/nightfall](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19169/nightfall) (see the right side above the weapon picture, phase 3 is listed)
---
For the sake of hunters everywhere, please add Ashjre'thul to BWL and Barb of the Sand Reaver to AQ. I know your intent was to only list contested items, which both of these shouldn't be. The latter in particular, I have seen warriors try to make a case for why they should get the Barb.
---
Items will be released in the original patch order. Rune of The Guard Captain was released in 1.5 which is most likely Phase 3. I don't have any specifics for you but I guess you are right, we don't exactly know how they will do quest hubs. EPL quest hub is a really good example. Did people try to go to these places in the Classic Beta?
---
3 characters is a lot of leveling for casual play.  Bottom line is, if the BOP robes are what you really desire then go for it.  Otherwise there are plenty of other good robes to be found in dungeons.  It's nice to have a money making profession to be able to buy a mount.
---
The community was full of assholes back then, too. The forums were overall pretty great, but were still a shit show.
---
And that's cool. But you can't realistically recommend people to roll those specs without letting them know about the caveats. Slim odds of getting raid spot. Probably not priority on loot. Will be asked to heal. Will have to farm consumes. Tier sets not fitting their role. Etc.

**US - Semi-Hardcore**  
---
**Server Type:** PvP or PvE  
---
**Faction:** Horde or Alliance  
---
**Classes:** Any of: Shaman (Any Spec), Feral Druid, Rogue, Mage  
---
**Preferred Raid Times:** Either Weekends or Mornings / Early Afternoons [PST]
---
**About:**  
---
* 28 yo Game dev. Schedule is inconsistent, afternoons and evenings can be completely booked, but with either weekday raids or morning / early afternoon raids, I can have ~99% attendance.
---
* Most weeks I have plenty of time, however random bouts of crunch time exist, so I am basing my availability schedule on the worst case scenario
---
* Looking for a mature guild with mind towards consistent progression through content. I don't care much about world / server firsts, as long as progress is being made and people are prepared and mature.
---
* Enjoys and is good at PvP, though organized WSG tends to be my least favorite flavor of PvP. 
---
* Willing to play almost anything that can be leveled and farm in a reasonable speed. Avoiding classes that would require a weekly time investment I might not be able to make.
---
* My main goals in Vanilla are to have fun with a good group of people, and complete content while it is still challenging.
---
* Able and willing to no-life for ~1.5 weeks after release. Wouldn't mind a cleave group to power through instances with.
---
**Experience -**  
---
* 12/15 Naxx in Vanilla [Warlock] pre 2.0  
---
* 5/6 sunwell in TBC [Main Tank Warrior] pre 3.0  
---
* Cleared H25 ICC in Wrath [Main Tank Warrior]  
---
* Have not done much more than casual raiding on Pservers
---
Shaman tank is actually doable, memeable, and fun.
---
Looking forward to getting drunk and doing this. Thanks.
---
What's your stance on Dal'rends then? The next upgrade for hunters would be Brutality Blade and Corehound Tooth. Obviously melee has priority on those so they can replace Dal'rends sooner than Hunters, which get the next upgrades in ZG.
---
Hunters would use Dal'rends for much longer but I still wouldn't roll on those with rogues or warriors needing them. The time argument is kind of stupid.
---
...the content isn’t nerfed? Is this just a meme because people don’t remember vanilla?
---
Getting an epic mount is an equal priority IMO, but it will be ezpz for priests when phase 2 drops and DME  is in the game.  From what I've read,  it seems that classic isn't going to nerf dme farming like private servers did so it is going to be an even bigger cash cow.
---
Lei of the life giver won't be in the game until phase 3,  but you won't even need it until phase 5 because you'll be using a two hander(Benediction) until then.
---
Dungeon items don't take long to farm if you have a decent and organized guild.
---
Truefaith should absolutely be a top priority for any priest in phase 1.
---
Ret nerfed
---
I believe the trick is to invite another character to your party, make them leader, then log off.

Vanilla wow was no more in 2007
---
It's like driving.  Anyone who drives faster than you is a maniac, anyone who drives slower than you is an idiot.
---
Alternatively, convincing low level players to help you summon a dreadlord.
---
Easy solution, don’t invite hunters to your group.  Ever.
---
Time is just one facet of the argument. There is also like, what it does for your class. 
---
"The next upgrade for hunters would be Brutality Blade and Corehound Tooth. Obviously melee has priority on those so they can replace Dal'rends sooner than Hunters, which get the next upgrades in ZG."
---
So why are you fine accepting that you won't get a Corehound Tooth, but asking about Dal' Rends? It is the same concept, the melees get much more out of this weapon that is just a stat stick for you.  Imagine a DPS warrior trying to take Nerubian Slavemaker for a stat stick. It is pretty much the same thing.
---
No hunters are getting rejected from raids because they don't have Dal Rends or HoJ. Melees actually are. You also have Bone Slicing Hatchets and Dawn's Edges which are pretty comparable to Dal Rends.
---
Just mine everything you can, finders keepers
---
I hope so. I rather enjoy my must-have-every-permanent-key-in-the-game fetish.
---
I would sell weapons and de armor. Weapons sell significantly more to merchants and produce about the same amount of materials from de. If you level tailoring, you shouldn't really have a problem leveling enchanting if you de the green items you make. Just don't expect to have a mount at 40 if you pick enchanting while leveling.
---
&gt; is Nightfall Hunter viable
---
Long answer: Absolutely not. You're talking about building a "spec" around doing paltry melee damage as a ranged class with a high-end, expensive 2h weapon that's really only useful in raid scenarios. But why take a Hunter with Nightfall unless your guild specifically designated you the Nightfall User. Which means they're forsaking one dps role for 15% extra spell damage to a single target. Which I guess if you're stacking casters that may work, but why put it on a Hunter when you could put it on a Paladin or Warrior? 
---
You're essentially resigned to having a really bad time playing your class just so \*caster DPS\* can do 15% more damage. Not even melee or healers, casters only. It's much more efficient to put Nightfall on an off-tank.
---
Try not to build a class around a particular weapon. It generally won't stay relevant past a few raid tiers, and then what?
---
Short answer: it's possible, but why would you?
---
Thanks, I sent an app! I should also mention, I have about 4 people who are playing with me as well. Is it cool if I send them the app too?
---
The /r/leagueoflegends subreddit is the worst.  My shy autistic girlfriend drew &lt;champ&gt; what do you think.  30k upvotes.  User builds awesome community tool that likely took 100s of hours of work. 15 upvotes and a bunch of people shit talking it for not having every single feature every other site has.
---
Right
---
Looks like Nightfall was added in the BWL patch. I think it's safe to assume you won't see that until phase 3.
---
Talent for Nature's Swiftness and heal if you want to raid Enhance in the meantime. After a few weeks, your group won't need as many healers, and the runs will be faster / more efficient if a few Shamans start swinging their 2H instead of heal.
---
If you’re being kited or trying to run away, you’ll be shape shifting a lot to break the snare/slow/cc. You can also break ccs like polymorph by shapeshifting.
---
Although, it is important to note that when you turn into an animal you’re susceptible to abilities like scare beast/hibernate
---
&gt; Nice dodge on his point about flying out the private server devs
---
Do you even understand the context on which Blizzard invited them to meet? Obviously not since you think it is in favor of your argument.
---
good catch. I was interpreting that post as meaning dungeon and raid content specifically, not all content in the game.   
---
I'm still not 100% convinced because you have provided me with information that will be disadvantageous to me, but time will definitely tell!
---
Looks good. Spotted one mistake though. Greater Agility on Gloves is not from Winterspring. I farmed it on last private server character I played so remember it well.The mob type is correct though. It drops in the top part of Azshara from the demon camps.
---
If you listen to the dev Q&amp;A's they flat out state things that suggest this.  They say they look closely at stats for balancing purposes.  They do not discuss the importance of maintaining class identity.  They talk about convenience factors constantly.
---
[Watch this stream of Kevin Jordan for example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxB4TWVr5xM) where he basically responds point-by-point to an announcement video of patch 8.2 and highlights all the differences in design choices between modern WoW and Vanilla.
---
They literally have a completely different philosophy on what direction to take the game in.
---
As opposed to what, 4K? I mean we're playing classic wow so the fidelity is never going to need anything above 1080p in my opinion, and other games I play (just Apex Legends lately) look great. It's only a 75hz refresh rate though so if you're real die hard with your gaming gear, it's probably a subpar monitor, but for vanilla wow and other low end games it's just fantastic value.
---
It's worth it since it's BiS for so long.
---
It's not a nerf. Private Servers used the post-Vanilla vendor value.
---
Should I play druid or gnome?
---
i will be rolling a druid alt and i always keep 2sets while leveling one for bear/cat and one for healing any good player will make an attempt at havin a healing set
---
* What classes we are looking for (currently everybody is welcome, but especially holy paladins are missing)
---
* Raid days
---
Yes, theres multiple changes - the main one being that you can only layer in a safe zone which prevents 99.9% of potential abuse/weird situations.
---
Why would guild out law (hots) heal over times? (Never been a healer myself)
---
For early 60 PvP I will be going with this:   [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hEczVdMqoZV0ek0x](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hEczVdMqoZV0ek0x) 
---
I think your first spec is strange to say the least. I know you're focusing on defense but things like toughness are basically worthless. The second spec is definitely better. For me I've found Improved Fire Totems to be very useful when you get a rogue or warrior on you (which is always). Eye of the Storm is less useful because of the short duration and you rarely get to hard cast in PvP (except AV) and you'll be trying to juke lockouts anyway. 
---
With low gear, Elemental Mastery is really good because its a guaranteed crit plus its mana free. My experience with Nature's Swiftness is that while yes it can give you an instant CLB which is nice, or an instant HW. The HW however is rarely useful on yourself because if its necessary you're likely going to just delay your death by 3 seconds. The best use for it is to save someone else then spam heal them to full right after. Choosing either one is fine early on IMO, and later when you have better crit gear NS is more useful.
---
I don't know but that melee range seems pretty dope
---
I think you missed the last part of that sentence.
---
Definitely mage.
---
Be a great off-tank! I can't tell you how much fun it is to save everyone's butt in raids when the MT screws up, healers or DPS pulls aggro, or some hunter pet goes spastic. You can speed up runs by pushing the limits on how many mobs are pulled at once, and you can DPS when an OT isn't needed. You'll be able to tank dungeons no problem with an OT build as well. There's less stress as an OT in raids, and a higher skill cap as a dungeon tank (which can be fun). If you do this as a warrior, you'll get to play with Nightfall and Annihilator, get sunders and shouts up right away, and these will all reduce kill times (making healers happy). If you OT as a druid, you can be the threat machine MTs dream of (although fury prot and druid MT look super fun end-game). Warrior and druid give a ton of diverse playstyle options if your goals change later on as well.
---
What has helped my group get going is that we already have a core base starting before the game is launched. There’s no reason you can’t get a guild running after release, but if you get a group of dependable gaming buddies before the games releases you have some good officers/co-leaders before you start.
---
Also, my guild will be splitting the Guild Leader position three ways. All three of us have been playing together for 10+ years now, so the drama between all of us has already been fleshed out. Then we will have our other core gaming buddies to be officers and from there we will only be recruiting members.
---
Starting guilds by yourself is immensely rough because you have to recruit like nuts and from there find who is worthy of officer positions and hope they are trustworthy.
---
Also, if you want to play as a casual, it’s always best to split the GL responsibilities. You can have a good amount of coverage if multiple guild leaders exist in the guild.
---
Despite that your post still manages to be worse than the average, which is impressive.
---
Good to know, thanks.
---
Ordered the same thing on Prime Day. :)
---
The fact that shaman can be a real healer and a PvP burst powerhouse in the same spec.
---
Can you find an older source? or an old source with a different price?
---
Warlock is laughably easy to hit the non-engineering skillcap though.
---
Not saying I'll have 3 characters leveled before 2021 but... Gotta have goals
---
Yes, I think it is worth it to have a shadow resist set. IIRC there are breakpoints for resist, so swap a few pieces out to meet one of those breakpoints, and you'll have a much easier time vs. spriest and SL locks.
---
This is something people did in early TBC arenas, actually. My spriest/mage comp got hard countered by PVE players who could swap to full shadow resist sets and win the game. That's why they removed gear switching from arena, actually.
---
Just send em a whisper and see about splitting 50/50. If they don't agree, get what you can. In your situation, don't feel bad. They seemed like they just wanted everything for themselves.
---
I view Classic as the agreeable starting point that people could get behind.  The question now is what direction to take it after all the content is released.
---
I actually think it would have been good to fix some of Vanilla's problems, but basically from a political standpoint, this was not possible because it seems like everyone assumed any changes would mean "more like modern WoW".  No changes was easy to rally behind to make the Classic project happen in the first place.
---
They haven't changed anything at all. It was 2s in patch 1.12 and it's 2s now. End of discussion
---
You can run to the edge of dun morough and jump off a mountain to the wetlands.
---
This is really fantastic
---
I agree that this used in combination with Suicide Kings or the EP/GP would create a great resource for those looking for setting up spending goals!  This definitely allows you to see "Oh this will be BiS for \[two\] phases - this is top prio for me!"
---
I have always preferred how female NE look that is a good enough reason in my book.
---
&gt; Dude, I never said people shouldn't comment on my post.
---
"This post was for those that don't like modern WoW."
---
&gt;  I am also not assuming EVERYONE who wants to play classic hates BFA.
---
You fell into the same exact thinking that literally any defense of content from cata onward means I love retail. All I said was that Cata didn't destroy the game. You responded with "So you are enjoying modern WoW." One thing doesn't imply the other, but because of this all-or-nothing attitude people seem to take with WoW, you assume it does.
---
&gt; The push for Classic WoW obviously came from a vocal group of players who are not satisfied with modern WoW.
---
I'm one of the people who pushed for classic. Stop assuming people's position.
---
&gt; I am speaking to an audience that shares that view.
---
No you aren't. You're speaking to a public forum. Not everyone shares your view.
---
When you post to a public forum, you don't get to dictate the conversation. Please. Get over yourself.
---
Yes, the price was increased in a later expansion. The 2s56c *is* #nochanges.
---
Combat log: Spell resisted
---
Saved up for a common mace from a vendor, told my friend about how pleased I was and was promptly told how stupid it was to buy it.
---
I imagine charging out of shadowmeld was probably a pretty good feeling/psychologically scarring for the target if they weren't expecting it
---
Being a warlock feels like batman. With enough prep I can handle any situation, from raids to pvp. Let me summon a pet, trade out some tickets, and it is game time. :P
---
Short answer is yes, I used to play WoW on an IBM R40 ... Single core Intel 1.4 laptop.... It wasn't pretty but it played XD
---
You are correct. I apologize for providing bad information. 
---
I forgot that it was removed in patch 1.12.
---
I was on one of "those" servers the other day. Cleared a pack of 4 mobs to get to a chest. Took quite a bit of time to kill all 4 by leashing one away at a time. Once I was about to kill the last one, some jerk just runs up and grabs the chest. These are the people that are the worst.
---
Tier 2 and free mount.
---
Yeah I like the idea of speccing for tank and being able to heal as well. I love 5 mans and i like the idea of an alt that can easily find a dungeon group as any role. 
---
You can heal 5 mans without being resto, right?
---
Vanilla elitism. Tried to turn bad character models into an inside joke. Would have been better without the caption.
---
Maybe you're the one that should leave. You seem like a massive tool dude..
---
Mp5 is big stat.
---
11 spirit is 2.75 mp/2, which works out to 6.75 mp5 outside the 5 second rule.
---
With talents you get 15% of that while casting, which works out to 1 mp5.  That doubles if you have the set bonus from T2.
---
My only concern is if half the people who can heal are doing damage, were going to need a lot more of those classes. I remember having 6-8 priests, 3-4 shamans and 2-4 druids healing. I think with modern organization we can get away with a lot less, but we will still need a lot of priests, shamans, and druids, and sharing the gear as well.
---
I mean I'm down. I'd love to be a dps shaman lol. But I know I'm gonna get stuck healing.
---
Honestly chances of me hitting 60 are slim, so just wanted breath.
---
Shaman will definitely gets a boost from all the beta/streamers that rolled shaman and had wild lvl 40 power spikes. Not sure how much an impact, but it def brought them to the spotlight

Yes. It was added before 1.12, it was a thing in the Classic Beta, it's in the game.
---
I disagree with this sentiment. Good guild leaders make their server communities better. Just because a lot of people have pessimistic views on longterm server health doesn't mean every server is going to die 3 months from release. If this guy wants to try being a guild leader and is actively attempting to learn the right way to follow through, I think "Leave it to the professionals" is just bad advice.

Freedom doesn’t protect from all forms of cc it’s movement impairing effects.
---
Tier 1 is universally pretty bad.
---
check youtube for some good players, druid is so underrated in my opinion.  you gotta think outside the box but it can be extremely powerful.  i wish i could remember who it was but this guy did a 1v3 in silithus and it was beautiful to watch
---
people think it's just about using cat dps or just being a flag carrier or healbot, but this guy used his forms for their utility, and killed people mainly in caster form with a lot of kiting.  1/29/21 is an awesome hybrid spec
---
&gt;Players also talk to eachother you know so they will tell others to not go to that particular fp and to avoid certain areas
---
This 100%. Not only that, but you get a target on your back which gets bigger the higher you rank. If there is high ranking player stirring up shit at a fp, people will go there to fuck that person up and corpse camp them.
---
In a world with no shortage of raid tanks, why are 39 people running with a sub-par tank to let one guy live his dream? That's what you "it's not optimal, but it's viable!" people keep missing.
---
I'm gonna admit, I didn't know what that was, but now I do and I feel enlightened for it
---
Honestly, if you really care about gear, you probably should just not roll a hunter. Hunters get screwed for gear throughout Vanilla. But just because they don't have prio for raid gear doesn't mean they should magically get prio for Pre BiS like Tarnished Elven. 
---
Hunters can solo DMT anyways though.   Yea for sure, communication is key. But if you want to be a good guy, as a hunter you should not be expecting to roll on Dal Rend's or HoJ. You should be actively telling your group you plan to roll on it, because people don't expect you to take that stuff.
---
I don't think shadow resist gear would be worth it considering you could just face another hunter or anything else and the stat be worthless.
---
The best thing would probably be potions that you can pop during an encounter, in my opinion.
---
Are you going alliance or horde it should not be hard to find a raiding guild as a warlock particularly on alliance side. Warlocks tend to be less played and more about n demand mages and warriors are everywhere.
---
[What I see on 3 machines across 6 browsers, regardless of being logged in or not](https://imgur.com/E1fk92H).
---
I spent ages farming mobs in the mines in Elwynn just to be able to afford a pet cat. This felt very important.
---
I vendored some decent stuff because I didn't know what AH was.
---
I got obsessed with my gear being enchanted after someone put fiery weapon on my dagger and always had him enchant everything I got. Which he did for free because he was nice.
---
So you really see no problem with a level 49 warrior, capable of wearing Plate, rolling against a feral druid tank on a +str + agi +stam leather chest piece? Really?
---
Never, Blizzard always disliked modding
---
It is fun to randomly heal warriors about to die in the wild to a bad pull. It is fun to be able to carry most groups through dungeons. It is fun to mind control people off bridges.
---
Honestly, the people that can ruin this game are the min-maxers. A majority of the playerbase will be busy people with jobs/kids/real responsibilities that won't have countless hours to play the game. Yes, the min-maxers will the be the ones that stick around long term, but they will also be a huge reason why people *leave.* The 'I will clear MC first week' Chads that laugh at those who are just playing and enjoying the game might prove to be a problem.
---
Just play the game whichever way *you* want to play it. Don't let the toxic min-max mindset ruin you capability to enjoy the game.
---
Totally fine, long as everyone is aligned with the whole we have lives, wont be raiding for a few months and it being one night a week!
---
Yes, but I was told it made you sit down and that there was some kind of funny emote that went along with it.
---
That's really useful, I'll make sure to save this comment
---
ahhh, someone who understands 😀
---
8/10
---
Display port
---
AP helps more than just autos...
---
all the other races play without stun resist
---
aoe stun is sicknasty (smack them, stomp, smack em again!!!!), a little extra hp is ultra beefy rawdog, and you have long arms so you can swing from across the map
---
I'm gonna do the same, plan is to take up herbalism and sell all my herbs as a I lvl for the extra g to aid in smoking heart, but really it might just take time, considering its practically BiS for feral OT, you will still get it well before any other class could say the same.
---
I didn’t know you could eat and drink at the same time. As a priest, I used to just heal my hp then drink water while leveling. 
---
Also, took me some time to realize you could shadowmeld _after_ you start drinking/eating and you’d stay stealthed
---
So what are you playing
---
Daffodil-picking racial is a must in wpvp
---
I've been singing this point as the gospel of Vanilla raiding everytime a LOLMEMESPEC thread appeared. Seriously, it's difficult to really get people to recognize that herding 40 cats weekly into and through a raid with 40 different schedules and commitments outside of the game is harder than the actual content lol.
---
We're not talking about absolute terms though, we're talking the stat distribution. All of t1 and t2 wastes stats on resistances, but even outside of that there is a huge difference between the strength of the sets relative to both each other and well itemized pieces of the same level.  
---
On the "losing" end of t2 you have something like Ten Storms because the distribution is super off. You have a weird mix of spell damage and bonus healing, itemization is straight wasted on spirit and crit is not a strong stat. This is why people generally at best only use a couple of the pieces. Compare that to The Earthshatterer - t3, which has \_perfect\_ itemization, a real rarity among classic tier sets, stam/int/heal/mp5, nothing wasted.   
---
I'm not arguing that it's good because its simply got more stats, I'm arguing that it's better itemized because it's not lacking any key stats or wasting points on something useless.  
---
It's the same problem for Netherwind, casters need a bunch of hit, but the entire set has none on it, while it wastes stats on mp5 on 3 pieces which is nigh useless. Nemesis also suffers from having 0% hit on the entire set.
---
The pure damage output just isnt as high, because you lack certain fury talents, such as flurry. You still hit hard, and if you're geared it's all the better. But mortal strike takes a debuff slot that most guilds wont want on the boss. And if you're not using MS, you're gimping much of your damage output. 
---
If you're a big pvper, some guilds wont mind taking you as arms, but chances are the content will have been completed, or the guild is on the casual side of things.
---
Good for leveling and PvP but get outclassed by fury on pure dps in a raid environment.
---
You're missing Robe of Volatile Power from MC :)
---
How far do you zoom the camera in? If anything you would look at the back of the head/back
---
Probably not, retail has a divergent audience.
---
They'll keep up the practices that maintain more *valuable* players, and provide the low cost alternative of old content to pocket our $15 a month.
---
You might get a BRD style dungeon at some point, but I sincerely doubt any kind of overhaul.
---
Before 1.8 there was a speed modifier that was calculated for instant attacks in the damage formula.  This meant some slow af weapons actually did way more damage despite less top end damage. (Barman shanker is a good example for rogues) - to address this - all weapons were normalized to certain speed (2 handlers had 3.6 I think etc) - meaning weapon speed didn’t really matter - only top end damage did - which, was now based on speed. So slower weapons are more valuable because their top end damage is usually higher all else being equal. 
---
But before - it wasn’t always as easy to figure out what was better. 
---
So now when people say slower weapons are better - it’s only partially true in the sense that slower weapons have higher top end damage than faster weapons when item quality is equal. 
---
What people should really say is “top end damage is better”.
---
rp servers are a weird breed. the people on there usually tend to be friendly and helpful, but now not only do you have the potential for all of the regular game drama, you have potential for rp drama, it can be pretty wild in my experience
---
If you take the time to get to 60 and try your best to get pre-raid BIS you will have a raid spot no matter what class you play. 40 man groups full of completely utterly optimal comps are not only unrealistic, they kill the concept of Vanilla. Play what you want and play it decently enough and you will have no problems. Unless you are a part of the min-max 'MC clear first week' crowd.
---
Don't.
---
60-80 raiders for a casual raiding guild? That’s way off my guy.
---
Hey your application form is down, can you reupload it please? Thanks! I'm looking forward to join a guild that raids on weekends
---
Good for *us*.
---
Yeah, they absolutely have a roll in an OT spot.
---
 So you really see no problem with a level 49 warrior, capable of wearing Plate, rolling against a feral druid tank on a +str + agi +stam leather chest piece? Really?
---
Appreciate the M+ meme  
---
I THINK we have settled on the warrior, druid, then a mage and rogue for DPS (I'm gonna be playing the mage). And yeah, I said prot warrior but I ment it more in the role sense, not as in the talent sense :P I only started playing WoW in legion so that is kinda ingrained into me haha :D Thanks for the advice
---
Many loot council systems rotate random non-officer raiders in and out of it monthly, so it isn't completely controlled by the officers, and if they try something shady, the rotatees can snitch on them.
---
Warrior. Smash.
---
yeah this is incomplete and wrong on many items.
---
People don't ask questions because they're lazy. They ask questions because they're interested to hear the thoughts of people who played vanilla, right now. They want to have a nerdy conversation with you because they're excited. It's the same as the same "favorite memories of X" thread every day.
---
Ah yeah...the ole [The Nicker] stole my mount jokes in the barrens...
---
Yeah, I kinda like the mage fantasy and like the idea of bringing a lot of utility :) Thanks for the advice
---
Well OBVIOUSLY HoJ is not BiS for Hunters. If it WAS BiS for hunters, you'd be stupid not to roll on it ofc.. it's literally the absolute best trinket available to you.
---
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQwH0atQZ0Q) should give you an idea, since he's really good. You very rarely shapeshift in PvE as resto, but all the time in pvp.
---
Don’t get it
---
I think that means it's the leader and they can change the group looting options.
---
We used to make up a fake Jumps Per Second macro that looked like a damage meter and drop it in /raid once in a while. (Horde though, because we're not animals, so no flips. Just jumps.)
---
That's very weird.
---
I've copied the link again and removed the "?usp=sharing" part at the end. Other than this, I have no idea why this would be happening to you.
---
It really should be noted that there is a lot of niche shadow priest gear that doesn't really fit locks or mages. This is because spriest doesn't benefit much from crit and also doesn't need to prioritize hit as much because they get a massive 10% from talents.
---
Items like Choker off Rag, Fel Infused Leggings, Snowblind Slippers, Firemaw's Clutch, Burrowers Bracers, Sash of Whispered Secrets are all items that are heavily tailored for spriest because they provide straight spell damage and some mp5.
---
Yes this means you really should pass on the first several Neltharion's Tears, it IS BiS for spriest, but mages and locks especially need the hit significantly more.
---
It really is surprising how little loot spriest competes with mages and locks on long term.
---
Yep, that fixed it, thanks.
---
It’s pretty shitty for max levels, but it has no level requirement. An amazing twink item at pretty much any bracket aside from 59
---
He’s saying that in 2007 it was the burning crusade...
---
So that 45s price isn’t relevant.
---
value of rogue diaries went down but speed of pickpocket runs went way up with auto-loot. Probably wont be a big difference in gold per hour. Personally, even if it was a little lower gold, I'd still take that trade any day.
---
Screw those who piss on you for this, you're doing a good job here, keep it up!
---
For objective things, sure.  But sometimes, some questions are worth asking again because you can get a lot of subjective opinions and experience from other players that can inform you better, or tailor more accurately to what you are trying to figure out.
---
Notably, reddit is essentially a discussion forum with no centralized infodump resource, and when you combine that with the terrible search feature it's not really alarming that people ask similar questions.  In fact it's pretty telling when the same questions can get different answers from one week to the next.
---
Some people are lazy, but some people just want opinions.  Asking the same questions over and over gets you more and more opinions as different people post.
---
Majority of your recent comments are downvoted. Votes don't mean a whole lot, but it seems people think you're a took too
---
Gear is just means to an end and won't matter most of the time anyway.
---
Personally I'll just level a hunter to farm gold and sustain my warrior  so I don't mind passing on gear with my hunter.
---
To be fair I was just grasping for straws to not be wrong in this discussion buuuut point still stands that on paper HoJ is the only available trinket for your second slot in the first phase that's worth equipping.
---
How are all you retail kiddies overwhelmingly so butthurt about Classic? lmao
---
Vanilla rank14 rogue. Classic rank14 spriest grind about to begin.
---
Supposedly content in Classic is going to be much easier than the "blizz-like" pservers everyone on this sub is used to. Also, for the record, yes the actual raiding content will be an absolute JOKE come Classic compared to how "hard" everyone remembers it being in Vanilla.
---
MC will be cleared in a few days by people in leveling Greens, without a single wipe. Over and Over and Over again.
---
Hmmm looks like you're right, it was changed to 2% miss in Wrath-Cata and then changed back to dodge in MoP.
---
Weird.
---
honestly the unique lore they gave belf paladins was pretty cool, but i can see being annoyed that you can only play them. i wish that along with them they had given undead paladins, like we already have undead priests AND canonical examples of undead paladins, it'd be sick af
---
And there are the references to the 2S prices, there is absolutely zero to a 2S item except for the one the shows up in 1.13.
---
I recently did ndale with a warrior while having played vanilla before and was just over 6 days played - would of been less had the server not been super progressed and I got camped to hell and back through the major zones
---
I have been considering playing survival hunter as my alt will not be raiding with it how viable is it in dungeons and RBG or is it a completely awfull. I just do not seem to have any memories of survival hunters from Vanilla i am guessing for a reason.
---
There isn't 400ms delay.  The people you talked to are idiots who don't understand spell batching.
---
Also: mail armor
---
Fire!!!!!!
---
Again, almost every item on Wowhead Classic says 1.13. There are NO Vanilla references to a 45s vendor price. You're just wrong here.
---
(;
---
Means it’s that players tun for loot .
---
Just FYI, Classic has been theorycrafted to death for the last 15 years. You’re not going to find some new groundbreaking build no matter how hard you try. Fire paladin is a meme not a spec.
---
*cough* ret pala *cough*
---
We can pick whatever we want and it can be fun, but we won't really have fun in the endgame if it turns out that the class we picked sucks in pvp or is perceived to be terrible for raids, and never get invited until they change to a spec they don't like. Also, in instances, some classes are greats but due to the debuff cap on mobs being 16 or so, only select debuffs will be allowed to be applied. So while feral druid cats might be good in an instance, they won't be able to use any of their bleeds in the raid, which would cut down dps massively
---
If they are referring to the slight delay in npc interactions, I hate to be the bearer of bad news but the game was like that, and I have been told the delay still exists in retail. You get used to it.
---
Fuck it. The content isn't that hard now that everyone knows it, it's 40 man so there's room for error, and it's finite so there's no hurry to get it all done. I'd love to be in a guild that run a bunch of dumb shit.
---
Lol all or nothing right?
---
"We" btw...
---
Talking about a small % of a small % but yes sie, have a pleasant day!
---
So you’re assuming it’s going to stay that way and that they wouldn’t fix something that was wrong with a beta?
---
**&lt;Get of Fenris&gt;** \- Horde - NA West - PvP Server - Mediumcore
---
 
---
**What’s it mean?:**
---
“Fenrir” or “Fenris” is the big bad wolf god from Norse mythology who bites off Tyr’s hand (ring some bells?), straight-up kills Odin, and casually ushers in Ragnarok aka the apocalypse. The word “get” in noun form means: an offspring or the total of the offspring. Thus “Get of Fenris” translates roughly into “the children of the wolf god who brings about the end times”.
---
​ 
---
**Our Philosophy:**
---
Despite our scary name (meant to strike fear into the hearts of the Alliance) The culture is a peaceful gaming environment free of bigotry and general “gamer rudeness” and one in which mistakes are expected to be corrected with regards to guild events such as raiding or PvP premades. Most of us are older than your typical gamer at this point in our lives, and we demand maturity from our members, you know - like how people expect one to act in the real world.
---
**So what about loot and stuff?:**
---
We will be using a EPGP point system for loot distribution and priority. The system rankings for loot priority will be charted on our webpage for transparency. EPGP is superior to DKP for many reasons that a quick google search will tell you. Certain BiS (Best-in-Slot) items from 40-man raids may have pre-requirements to purchase with EPGP. The MT will be loot counseled items during all progression.
---
**What Gets us apart:**
---
We have a built-from-the-ground-up donation system where players may contribute materials and consumables to the guild bank to gain EP and raise their loot priority. This allows top performers an edge, and those who may be busy with life to still have access to end-game consumables if they were unable to farm them. It also provides the guild bank income which will be passed down to our raids. Do you like free enchants? So do we.
---
PvP has always been a passion of many of our members, as such **we will have an in-house bounty system for world PvP in which players can earn EP for the collection of “scalps” (screenshotted 1v1 or 2v2 kills of bounty targets listed on our webpage).** This gives incentive for higher level players to assist lowbies just trying to level who may be getting camped (PvP server), and allows for hardcore PvPers to gain some loot priority in raids. Plus we think it’s cool.
---
A lot of guilds will tell you they encourage a mature playing environment, and they are likely being truthful. Few guilds actually achieve this, but do trust it is a top priority for us so that we may all enjoy our hobby. During raids we demand focus, but we also know how to have fun. We never allow bigotry to go unchecked, and although we sometimes disagree, we respect everyone in and out of guild. We do not brag of our successes, and we believe recognition is achieved through action. Many of us have known each other for going on 15 years or longer and we have already have a strong community. We really look forward to starting a new chapter on Classic and hope we’re a good fit for you!
---
​  
---
**A Brief History:**
---
GoF has been a gaming community since 2004 with several hundred members over many MMOs in as many years. We started on Vanilla WoW, achieved a lot of end-game raiding and PvP success, and generally played the game like few then could.
---
Phase 1 we will have two (yes TWO) Molten Core groups. East and West coast.
---
East Coast: Sun/Mon 7:00 - 10:00 PM EST. (4:00 - 7:00 PST) West coast: Tues/Thurs 7:00 - 10:00 PM PST (10:00 - 1:00 EST)
---
Members may sign up for either that fits their schedule. Some more hardcore members should be able to raid both events with an alt/main.
---
**Guild Priorities:**
---
Raiding 40-man content (3 days weekly) and PvP (When not raiding. Premades and 20-man content will be ran on non-raid days). The 3rd day is a flex day for outdoor bosses and possibly Onyxia. MC will be ran in two days. We ask members to try and be available at least two out of the three days.

Drop us a line and let’s talk Classic! Our server is already very active with players getting ready.Not playing Horde? Ask about our IRL friends who are rolling Alliance and are good solid raiders. Even though we’re gonna like, gank them and stuff.
---
Yea you did because it’s spell batching.
---
AV doesn’t come out out until phase 3. Phases are most likely gonna last 3-6 months so you’ll probably get something better before then.
---
Don't worry about it's just a mage/warlock wep ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
For hunter
---
- Tracking is super useful in pvp. I feel blind at times on other classes.
---
- it feels very active in pvp. jump/spin/shoot while kiting, watching your distance at all times, etc. You don't get a ton of chances to just plant your feet and dps, because even other ranged classes try to get close to you
---
- the toolkit is very fun for group pvp support. I'm looking to burst down clothies, but I'm also tossing flares and making sure healers don't get jumped by stealthers.
---
- best cc in the game for 5 man content if played right. More mobs are vulnerable to freeze trap than sheep, banish, or sleep.then you have fd/retrap and pet tanking.
---
- it has the best quest in the game to kill the rhok delar demons
---
- Not as gear dependent as other classes, which will be very nice in early game pvp
---
op asks why we aren’t raging about it. Probably because we don’t deliberately misinterpret it like he does.
---
I dont mind people asking about classes and shit like that even if it was asked 1000x before. There are always different comments and you might learn something new in most of them. But simple google searches that take 2 seconds like do i need bfa to play classic really have to stop
---
" **What pro-tips do you guys have to make my life easier from a logistical standpoint?** "  
---
Don't
---
Likely you will be more useful not raiding as an offspec, but you still need to gear your offspec to reach its potential. As far as rolling for offspec gear(outside of specific guild rules like dkp/lc):
---
1) if your raid spec is already geared, and you are not rolling for it 
---
2) you make it clear at the beginning of the group/raid that you are rolling for your offspec 
---
3) you aren't picking up bad pieces for your offspec that are "upgrades", like leather on a ret pally
---
yeah, its the other way around
---
That was the beta, dont fret. Im sure it will only improve in time.
---
Dumb 10x as much silver instead
---
Yep, mage for sure.
---
Lol good math...
---
People will be 60 before labor day.
---
Not saying thats my plan since rushing 60 doesn't matter to me, but there will be plenty of level 60s before the first week even expires.
---
It's definitely optimal in many situations too.  Because you can't respect mid raid you have to bring your versatility and a feral tank can be a huge benefit to the raid.  They also are capable of tanking many fights and while they might take more damage in some fights than a war they also generate more threat making content you can already clear go even faster.  Imo any raid with a good feral is better than a raid without one.  Multiple feral gets sketchy though.

Seems they have introduced lot's of vendor trash latest patch. But some of it, like the antiquated gun, has got a very high vendor price (several g's). This usually indicated good quality. Maybe there is a hidden quest that needs those items. I wouldn't verdor it straight away, until there has been a week and we know if there are new quests that need those items.
---
This has to be posted before 1.12.1, because that patch is mentioned in a later post, and the way he talks about the items added sounds like the items added was worth a lot.

The cast isn’t .5 seconds. It has been one second at least on the servers I was on. It might be different or not. I think you are lying. Believe me or not and try it for your self on nef/ony. These small details changing or not is honestly going to make this time around very enjoyable.
---
Well no, it's just that fury is absolutely monsterous. Arms is better for leveling and PvP definitely, but fury dps is ridiculous.
---
Everyone keep saying druids can only OT but from my research, feral can be MT for 99% of fights.

Thanks for sharing this, I've been working on my own, but it's notoriously tricky to balance with so many variables and arguments to consider! Looking forward to combing through this later on :)
---
This is what I had come up with, for comparison:

---
Oh no doubt. With World Buffs and BiS gear SF is better than most specs. I'm going combat for progression but definitely intend to build a SF set for later.
---
&gt; delay in game on all activities of about 400ms
---
If you play on US servers from EU, pings in that range are not at all out of the ordinary.
---
AFAIK tests are hosted in US only and there are many people playing from EU.
---
This would explain it and the "handful of people" you've heard from are just morons ... OR you are trolling.
---
+1 to this. I leveled in vanilla as MM purely because I didn’t know any better at the time and because I couldn’t rely on the pet as much as a BM hunter, you have to use unconventional methods to get the job done.
---
Neither are wrong. Some parts of reddit understand that people are lazy, and just answer there questions and are okay with it. Other parts will tell you not to ask a question that can just be googled.
---
Ah, the thing is it depends a little bit on what you definition of "skill ceiling" is. ***Do you mean the class that has the most abilities to deal with, or the class with which you have to play perfectly, because any mistake can be fatal*** ?
---
You see, **Hunters** are possibly the class with the most of abilities/micromanaging going on, but it's not that important, because Hunters are quite OP. CCs, melee/ranged slows, kiting, fight reset, good armor ... Hunters have so many tools you can fuck up at some points in a PvP fight an come out winning by a large margin if you play it right later on. In that sense Hunters are probably the class with the most things going on, but it's very forgiving.
---
As for the other way to define "Skill ceiling", you have **Druids**. Also a lot of abilities to deal with, but outrageously unforgiving gameplay. Getting out of bear form at the wrong moment ? You're dead. Didn't time your long-cast healing spells properly when kiting ? You're dead. Didn't manage shapeshifting to keep mana for a long attrition fight properly ? You're OOM and then dead. Druids are horribly difficult to play perfectly, because every little thing counts ***A LOT.*** In tense duels against rogues, you might not even be able to use Faerie Fire because you can't waste a 1 second GCD on it at the risk of loosing. Brutal.
---
**Warlocks** are a mix of both - if they're not SL that is, case in which you're mindlessly facetanking everything. A lot of abilities, but little mistakes (poor fear timing for example) might kill you. By nature, Priests, as they don't have CCs, are also very reliant on perfect gameplay (proper mvoement is very important, and timing Silence/ Fear AOE is mandatory).
---
But hey, almost every class has a high skill ceiling if you're really willing to play ideally in all possible fighting situations. Being able to adapt to anything is difficult, no matter the class.
---
YOU CAN SUCK MY DRUID. Naw jk, but seriously.
---
I'm with you OP, Classic+ is a better gamble than retreading the same path with TBC Classic. In fact, check out this poll that was done here on this sub. Most people instinctively KNOW which features should go into such an experience. Perhaps a Voting system along with Game Designer veto would work, so if we all vote to include flying the Game Designers can refer to the "constitution of 2005" and veto our majority vote.

Yo, but how much rage does Mortal Strike cost?
---
**Benevolent Elephants**. US, Alliance, PvP Server, PST based Semi-Hardcore Casual Guild.
---
​
---
Our Plan:
---
* To raid in a Semi-Hardcore Casual way. What does that mean? Casual number of raid nights and length of raids. But hardcore when inside the raid. Progression is the number one goal.
---
* To build a quality team of like-minded gamers interested in everything Classic WoW.
---
* Progression Raiding, 5 mans, and some optional PvP.
---
* We plan to clear every raid in Classic, including Naxx long term. Given the mixed style of casual and hardcore, we don’t plan on being world/server first, and that is ok!
---
About Us:
---
* Goal-driven mature gamers. 
---
* We love gaming and enjoy accomplishing our goals with friends.
---
* Many of us play nightly while others play casually.
---
* We understand real life/gaming balance and work with all our members to ensure everyone has a place.
---
* We are parents, workers, family members, and of course, gamers.
---
* Experienced leadership with successful raid experience from vanilla, to current high end Mythic raiding.​
---
Who we want:
---
* Mature gamers driven by a passion to succeed.
---
* Gamers who want to clear content in a timely manner in a non-toxic environment alongside other laid-back adult gamers.
---
* Members willing to put real effort into their class/role and work to be the best they can be.
---
* Members who understand real life constraints, yet still desire to clear content.
---
* Members who respect and appreciate other people’s time by being Punctual, Prepared, and Motivated.
---
* Casual Members/PvPers/Non-A team raiders are always welcome. Likely to form a “B Team” more casual raid group.
---
Goals:
---
* Kill all the bosses, with a core group of “A Team” Raiders.
---
* Make new friends.
---
* Make LOTS of new memories and relive some past ones.
---
Secondary Goals:
---
* Build a successful pvp team during non-raid nights. (Optional)
---
* Build a “B team” raid group that is more casual once inside the raid(think little to no consumes required)
---
The Important Info:
---
* Raid Nights: Tuesdays and Wednesdays (With a possible Optional 3rd night being added once AQ drops, to be discussed with guild when the time comes.)
---
* Times: 8pm to 11pm Pacific time
---
* Faction: Alliance
---
* Server: PvP
---
* Voice: Discord
---
* Loot: EPGP with LC oversight for at least a few months to see how much the guild and the leadership like it. If EPGP is deemed to be not good. We will use Loot Council instead, decisions made public in a member read only discord page, to help transparency. Or publicly in the main discord voice channel. Exact details on the transparency to be fine tuned over time.

Ah, the thing is it depends a little bit on what your definition of "skill ceiling" is. ***Do you mean the class that has the most abilities to deal with, or the class with which you have to play perfectly, because any mistake can be fatal*** ?
---
Night elf for warriro is great, with dodge especially. Wait for my human warlock
---
He was saving the best feature for last.
---
No decent guild lets warriors roll for the best epic swords before the rogues have them already, because the rogues NEED them, the warriors can use any 1 handers to great efficiency, like axes for example.
---
Hooray! 
---
I don't plan on playing Cyberpunk because I heard you have to watch cut scenes and can't skip them.
---
Game isn't out, you haven't played it, and you let others determine your "excitement"
---
Enjoy fortnite season 228 after the first month of classic launch!
---
Maybe they’ll finally just kill retail since it sucks.
---
Not necessarily true. Pservers have found some stuff that werent known/popular during vanilla but pservers aren't 1 to 1 with classic so some adjustments might be beneficial.
---
It's pretty harsh to make hunters compete with rogues on the highest dps crossbow in the game since it is a stat stick for them.
---
On the other hand, I wouldn't send Band of Accuria to a single hunter until every melee had it and that goes for any 2% hit item.
---
If its just some rando on your faction, just mash away. First come first serve.
---
If its in your party, do a /roll or negotiate.  If someone wants to do a level up, let them take the first pick to get the skill point and then take the rest. Or round robin.  Anything works if you're in coordination.
---
If its an enemy faction player, Red == Dead.
---
Not trolling.
---
You just need a regular active subscription in order to get access. Take noe that if you want to reserve any character name(s) you'll want to do so at or before August 13th, when character creation and server selection is opening.
---
The only class it's a raid weapon on is druid tank for tanking Rag and fire imps. But most guilds give it to the pally/shaman anyway for pvp.
---
Horde lol! That's an off spec in itself.
---
Prozac fixes this! And more!!

 **&lt;Celestial Born&gt; \[Alliance - NA - PvE Server\]**
---
If you...
---
...want to experience Phase 1 MC/Ony
---
...are T3 BiS minded
---
...seek organization that allows work/play balance
---
...and hope to play with driven, mature, and friendly adults
---
then we may be the perfect fit for you.
---
As Celestial Born grows we find ourselves home to many outstanding players  with high-end experience from Vanilla, private servers, retail, and every expansion in between. We’ve played many MMO's at all levels of  dedication and leadership and look forward to returning to the MMO that has defined our gaming experience. We continue to take advantage of an early-recruitment cycle for Classic to bring like-minded players together to establish a thriving, competitive, and healthy guild culture.
---
**Mission:**
---
Our primary goal is to establish an organized raid core capable of clearing content quickly and enjoyably. Our member expectations and in-depth plan for Classic can be found at [http://celestialborn.com/charter/](http://celestialborn.com/charter/).
---
**Raid Schedule:**
---
Tuesdays:  6-10pm PST
---
Wednesdays:  6-10pm PST
---
Wednesdays will be eliminated as much as possible in early phases.
---
**Loot:**
---
Pre-designated loot council (details within Charter)
---
We are still recruiting for many positions, including non-raid core members whom prefer our environment but may not fit perfectly due to experience or schedule.
---
If you are interested in learning more please refer to our website at [http://celestialborn.com](http://celestialborn.com/).
---
Thank you and best of luck in your search for the perfect guild!
---
Keep up?
---
People will be hitting 60 on their first character weeks after naxx releases.
---
You'll be fine.
---
I joined multiple guilds at once, and this was the only one I stuck around in. Very friendly, very helpful, and the atmosphere very much fits what I was looking for (mediumcore). Highly recommend.
---
Haha nice. Fucking mushrooms
---
Just check on sodapoppin on classic beta, manny people praised him for his good shapeshifting and him using all different forms is what made him the best druid in beta.
---
Yeah people say the dodge is bad because you don't generate rage on dodges... but you know what I think my healer quite likes it when I don't take damage.
---
A level 19 character is a lot easier to BIS than a level 60 character. And those items you get are absolute BIS, unlike at 60 where each new raid tier has new BIS items.
---
Yeah I wouldn’t take any Mage and Lock BIS gear from any dedicated Mages and Locks, because I want the Guild to succeed.  But items like Firemaw’s Clutch? That has S. priest written all over it.
---
I like that S. priest doesn’t need great gear to succeed....   but I used to main a Rogue.  I’m worried I won’t like the lack of scaling and gear progression compared to say a Mage or Lock.
---
Have you raided as Shadow before?
---
Hmm bear? No wait, panther! Nahhh, definitely a cheetah
---
Yeah. Play the game when you can, you'll be able to clear MC, even I'd it takes you 3 years.
---
It means that you play on a private server and they exploit the master loot mechanic to rotate loot privileges on mobs. You shouldn't see this on official servers, except in raids. Or if you really switch to master loot.
---
I’m willing to bet we will still see some dualwield tanking once raids completely out gear the content - even with the increased parry. 
---
Probably not to the same degree we saw on pservers though. 
---
That being said - i feel like that’s the main thing people criticize him for.  The dude is literally just trying to help with his experience that he has - which he acknowledges will be different - but I don’t think it will be so different that everything he says is just bullshit.  Give the guy a break.
---
I think Mark of the Chosen says on the tooltip that it's a 2% proc rate. It's a good trinket. You won't handicap yourself if you're tanking early stuff with that.
---
Smoking Heart of the Mountain is way better though. You want Enchanting if you're going to tank in raids.
---
Just don't invite random people who don't talk and have other goals in the game. Everything else can be solved. The game is not hard but people have got to help each other. Especially when there is no guild bank. And as it been said, the most important thing is having a quality healer, so you are always ready to do group content.
---
Sure, IMO if someone in the guild wants sulfuras that isn't the GM they should buy the mats from the guild, either at a reduced price or full AH value.
---
*sigh* why are you talking about 1.10? I'm clearly talking about earlier...
---
I don't remember. I know it's 2.4 for 1handers. Can't remember the 2hand ones, but I'd lean towards 3.6. But I haven't paid much attention to it, so take it with a grain of salt: I must confess I view 2handers of all sorts as a bit of a meme. Do I even pvp mate?
---
That said, I've been looking at some arms stuff lately, and the cleave things look pretty nice. I'll be doing that for leveling, I think.
---
hahaha
---
&gt;Nobody will be pushing for world first
---
You don't know what you're talking about. There are already hardcore guilds planning and preparing for that.
---
Not acceptable. By the time you get a tremor pulse the boss is already out of position at best, breathed on the raid and tail swiped the rest most likely.
---
29 and 39 bracket are dominated by hunters though, since they have a speed boost and nobody (other than feral druids and rogues) do, they can just kite you forever.
---
It won't.
---
They are two totally different games catering to different player bases.
---
It shouldn't hurt to skip tailoring as a casual. You will have a better time with alchemy/herbalism.
---
god fuck this sjw hysteria.
---
I enjoy both.  It's fun to one shot lvl 21 mages but it's also tons of fun to organize a 10v10 WSG with a rival guild.
---
They day horde opts for GoA over WF totem is the day the horde all give up and roll alliance.
---
This sub is a breeding ground for elitist douchebags and is in no way indicative of the vanilla community.
---
That is a very specific example. It depends how much str and agi is on the chest piece for a dps warrior to justify taking it or not. 
---
If it's clearly a bear tank chest then dont take it. Use your judgement. But you said plates should never take leather gear if theres a leather user in the group. Thats absurd. The best dps gear for warr is not all plate. As a rogue that can only wear leather, you are the class with restrictions on what you can use and roll on, not the warrior. Don't like it? Roll a warrior. Warriors will be even wanting your boots of shadow flame. Get used to it.
---
No no you are mistaken, Classic launches in 27th of August in 2019, not 15 years ago.
---
Despite being a meme even back in vanilla - boomkin could be a real pain in the ass in PvP - especially out in the world. I distinctly remember running cauldrons in the plaguelands with some newer players trying to up their Argent Dawn rep for Naxx Attunement, and getting hit by a Boomer I didn't see coming. Starfire stun into insect swarm, moonfire, root, starfire and a few wraths was more than enough to drop me before i could blink.
---
Also the sound of insect swarm if you play with sound on, is disgusting - sounds like you're walking out to the dumpster on a hot summer day.
---
100 percent fax
---
Eh, you just need a shaman in the tank group to have good boss timers so it ticks correctly.
---
You might be mistaking her breath for her roar and if you do that you will get out of sync. Ony does it randomly. Nef does it on a timer.
---
I like being a ranged class with a pet and not being afraid of running out of ammo.
---
Also being a legit evil bastard fits my class fantasy so well.
---
No kid, that's not how math works.
---
A 27 inch screen is 311.5 square inches.
---
A 24 inch screen is 246.12 square inches.

2560 * 1440 / 311.5 = 11834.35 PPI^2

The 27 inch monitor has 40% more PPI.
---
Dungeons arent very hard the spec will be fine, probably  more useful than people will expect.  Being able to sleep one mob and freeze a second will make most pulls trivial. Survival tree is quite good, particular the %agi talent once people get heavily geared. Until then though the tree is used mostly for pvp utility and the %hit talent for when people are gearing up.
---
The reason you never see deep survival is because scatter shot tends to be seen as a much better ability than wyvern sting. 2 min CD, not much more damage than serpent sting, have to be out of combat, easily dispelled or broken. The best scenario for it really is dungeons I think.
---
IMO it can only be ninja looting if they steal the item or can’t use it. 
---
In the case of HoJ I’d call someone a ninja if they master looted right before the kill and gave it to themselves without reserving it before the run began.
---
Me and my buddy rolled a warrior/shaman duo and would farm GY almost every game, it was a long time ago but I don't remember hunters being a problem. PoD and WF ftw
---
From what I've heard, dead people don't generate much rage either
---
Night elf for the win ! Actually my war will be dps so human but still
---
I have seen a few people claim PvE was made easier in 1.12 or gradually during vanilla WoWs lifespan, but I do not remember anything of the sort from back in the day, and I have not seen a single one of you people provide evidence.
---
So prove it.
---
Prove there were patches that made PvE, especially raids easier.
---
I don't understand why some people here are so obsessed with retail.
---
Having two different games catering to two different audiences is very good for both versions, both from a customers and a business perspective.
---
Retail players want different things than what Classic players want, they have their own reasons to complain, Blizzard shouldn't let Classic influence retail development *at all*, no matter how successful it can be, it would totally defeat the purpose of having two different games.
---
**US, PvP, Horde, CST/EST - Semi-Hardcore**
---
Myself and a group of friends are looking for a guild that is looking to raid at a respectable pace, but isn't planning on putting timers on the levelling portion, and isn't raiding more than 2-3 nights a week. We are all adults with jobs, some with families, so although we play pretty much every night, we aren't planning on nolifing it at any point (although some have taken time off for launch). The majority of us raided throughout Vanilla, and have played on multiple private servers throughout the years. We know what we're doing, and we know when to take it seriously, but much more enjoy having fun.
---
A group of us are also very much in to the PvP scene, so we would like a guild that is active in that respect as well.
---
Right now our mains are looking to be Rogue, Warlock, Priest, Shaman, Mage and one undecided - although any of these could change.
---
Looking forward to hearing from you!
---
You mean everyone won’t be solely picking the best races and classes and hardcore raiding?
---
Mostly because hunter is near the top of their power curve compared to everyone else and although they lose to warlock...and maybe mage - they absolutely shit on everything else for a good while.
---
That, too.
---
WF boosting DPs is far more important than a bear offtank getting GoA. Even with expensive totem twisting, better off twisting tranquil air with WF for the melee group instead.
---
# &lt;MERCENARY&gt; - Horde | US-East | RP-PvP
---
**Focus-** Experiencing the World of Warcraft while obtaining fortune and glory with a motley crew of hard lifes, lowlifes and no-lifes. If blizard does not launch classic with RP-PvP realms we will be rolling on whatever PvP realm the community decides is the unofficial NA RP-PvP realm. *The PvP part is the most important part*.

**Schedule-** Raid time currently projected for every other week, Mon and Tues from 1930-2300. This lets us hit two raid lockouts and get back to PvP, farming, and general tomfoolery for the rest of the week.

**Membership-** Seeking people with a goals-based mindset who want to be in Azeroth to escape the overbearing culture of politics and memery that has invaded all of the internet this past decade. It does not matter if you are a MAGApede, a Hilldawg, a Bernout, a Fascist or a Communist. Can you get out of range of Rain of Fire and press buttons in something resembling the correct order? Fantastic, you're hired. Total noobs are allowed. Although leadership has extensive experience in private servers, expecting everyone to have played technically illegal copies of a 15 year old game is a stretch.

Come on by and say hi
---
They don't but they also don't take damage so.... I'll always welcome a dodge.
---
Leveled my first char to lvl 25 before I discovered that you can learn and uprank skills at the class trainer
---
Going Ally Hunter, only one way to go, Female NE, because those bow animations
---
I haven't played in years but omg rogue was so fun. I got really good dps in pve and world pvp can be really funny.
---
Lmao, we're all playing a video game, our time has no value anyway.
---
Doing what you enjoy however makes that lost time worth it. Even if that is ganking lowbies.
---
It's an mmorpg, if you can't handle other people messing with you go play a single player game.
---
Also pretty funny that your first thought was going going toward welfare. Projecting much?
---
I prefer just having a second monitor to watch stuff on.
---
Thats not the example you gave.
---
This is:
---
Imagine a lvl 45 warrior, fully capable of wearing plate, rolling on  Str/Agi leather gloves, when there's a rogue in the group. Sorry but that's unacceptable, and the warrior should be, and very likely would be, called out for that.
---
Hell no. If those gloves are an upgrade for the warrior there is no reason at all they shouldn't take them. Warrior prebis is devilsaur leather, cadaverous chest/ savage glad chain. Do hunters and rogues just get these defaulted to them too?! Hell no.
---
Skarm was actually talking about this recently where he said that with a perfect AI that makes no mistakes, horde is definitely the strongest side simply because of windfury. However players don't play perfectly and Alliance gets punished less for minor mistakes thanks to paladins.
---
This is such a great idea and I appreciate the effort because Im never going to do it but I will critique a little. This is based off classicbis site which is pretty awful in terms accuracy. I'd advise people looking at that site, as well as this spreadsheet to take it with a grain of salt. The lists don't take into account for several things that are pretty important when it comes to gear selection.  %based buffs like kings and zg buff (making primary stats have more weight that ap, ex. when buffed 10str on a warrior worth 20 ap, better than 24ap because kings(ally only) gives 10% to str and zg another 15%, so 25% more strengh ie 2.5/10 is another 5ap giving you a total of 25 ap &gt; 24 ap. Another thing with warrior is how hit plays with the "crit cap" and how valuable hit is with gear and world buffs. So when you are world buffed hit is valubable because it allows you to obtain a higher crit cap and you will probably pushing it if you have world buffs and good gear. The better gear you have and the more buffs you have hit becomes more valuable to push that crit cap higher. However if you dont have world buffs and you arent blocked by the crit cap, crit become much more valuable especially as you approach end game gear levels and are rage dumping with Herioc strike(ability, meaning only required 9% hit, race/wskill depending) 90% of the time.
---
So when the guide says things like warrior never replace ony tooth neck, heres 3 items that are better for warrior 90% of the time. Eye of Hakkar, Barbed choker, Stormrage talisman of seething. Why? cause you already have 14+% hit from other items, you arent blocked by crit cap, you arent rage starved, and you are using herioc strike 50+% of the time anyways. 
---
On top of that all when you arent rage starved, and over ability hit cap, a crit and a hit essentially do the same(of very close to) thing to the hit table. If you miss you do no damage and gain no rage, a hit reduces your chance to miss. Now you do 1 damage instead of 0, and increase of 1. If you crit you do double damage and double rage. Now you do 2 damage instead of 1. An increase of 1. Hit really shines when you are passed crit cap though because then 1 hit also gives 1 crit and instead of doing 0 damage you are essentially doing 2 damage. 
---
Source: Played warrior on nost/lightshope and various other pservers launch through naxx multiple times.
---
Both combinations are fine. Mining has great gold potential, when gathering Arcane Crystals and selling them on AH. Getting Arcane Crystals is easier than Bloodvine with Herbalism.
---
For PvP,  tauren droods don't have to worry about shamans running train and purging then. Paladins can't really kill druids in a 1v1 so there's that.
---
For pve I would just say druids get slightly more benefits from paladins especially in raids. Shamans and druids despite having very similar spell kits don't really synergize well.
---
Sometimes humans like to have conversations about things they enjoy with people other than themselves.
---
Honestly it's anyone's guess since none of us are in the building making decisions.
---
However I'm genuinely surprised at the backlash this question receives every time it is asked.
---
- Jagex reintroduced OSRS with massive success (nearly 150,000 players at any given time)
---
- Daybreak has continued to release progression servers for Ever Quest in addition to new content.
---
- And finally the king of the MMORPG scene is doing the same with classic.
---
Older games have been re-released but, not to the extent that mmo genre has. OSRS has wayy more players than RS3. And EQ has wayyy more players than EQ2.
---
I think there's enough common sense to realize that the older design philosophy (whatever it was) really works for MMORPGs. Hopefully that means we will see some modern games take the same strategies.
---
Have a priest or shaman healer for that juicy free +25% armor buff.
---
Very much like others are saying so I won’t repeat the whole spiel or ensure you have enough officers to manage etc.
---
I myself was never a guild leader but was an officer for a guild that raided for all of WOTLK. Our guild leader was a teacher by profession and hilariously it did help as there are lots of transferable skills.
---
You have to set behavioural expectations. If you want a guild with a very boisterous environment with people making dark jokes, friendly insults that kind of thing, that’s fine, but you must be clear about that. Most importantly make sure your raid leaders aren’t quick to flame. Nothing puts off raiders than being shouted at for not hitting that interrupt or polying the wrong target. 
---
Now there’s limits to this if someone is massively screwing up. I remember once we had a player who started getting way too hammered during raids and became quite frankly useless, but this was a private chat for the guild leader to have, not for them to be called out in front of 25 (and possibly 40 in classic) people.
---
End of the day it’s a game. People are there to have fun. Just ensure you create the kind of atmosphere for fun YOU want and then ensure people know that’s the kind of guild you are.
---
Would rather see more wholesome "cringe" than the typical exclusionary toxic shit this sub puts out.
---
Buff cap
---
Great resource!
---
No. I am not mistaking it. At least on server I played on ( Most recent fresh), Ony fears much more often than your berserker rage cd, random or not. So does Nef.
---
&lt;Centrally Planned&gt; | Horde | NA-PVP | 9:30-12:30 EST/6:30-9:30 PST (Tues/Thurs) | Semi-hardcore
---
Introduction: &lt;Centrally Planned&gt; was formed by a group of folks who met playing modern wow, enjoyed each other’s company, and found communist memes amusing (For real though we have a lot of liberals/leftists. You for sure don't have to be. But if you get triggered by the existence of the left, that might be an issue).
---
Raid Schedule: We will be raiding two nights a week 9:30-12:30 pm EST/6:30-9:30 pm PST on Tues and Thurs. We will use loot council made up of a mix of officers and a weekly rotation of raiders with a focus on gearing tanks and healers first.
---
Player Expectations: We are listed as semi-hardcore because we all have lives and know some accommodations must be made for that. The officer core is made up of people who are neither in high school nor unemployed with the ability to no-life and play 24/7. That said, we expect people to come prepared with consumables and arrive on time. As we only will raid six hours a week, we need to be efficient and players should aim for 80%+ attendance.
---
The guild will be focused on the PvE content of the game but we are intentionally rolling on a PvP server as it is a pretty fun aspect of the game.
---
&gt;Ideally looking for:
---
&gt;
---
&gt;2 fury warriors
---
&gt;1 rogue
---
&gt;2 resto shamans
---
&gt;3 mages
---
&gt;3 locks
---
&gt;1 hunter
---
&gt;2 resto druids
---
On Culture: &lt;Centrally Planned&gt; is centered around establishing a healthy and comical environment for those looking to progress through classic content with a semi-hardcore attitude focused on personal responsibility. We look to provide an inclusive atmosphere where homophobia, sexism, racism, and the like aren’t tolerated. You don’t need to have a bleeding heart, but if you can’t keep casual bigotry out of guild dealings, somewhere else would be a better fit.
---
If this sounds like a good fit, come say hey on our discord channel https://discord.gg/vmC5sMb
---
&gt;If I did play paladin in classic, it would probably be holy all the way up through 60 until I can accumulate enough decent gear to respec to retribution for PvP. This is similar to my warrior plan - to tank until I can get a good Arms set for PvP.
---
Why does this seem backwards to me?
---
To be fair, when I'm excited about priest, but not as a healer, everyone says play what you like, but don't expect to raid.    I guess only time will tell, but there is an overabundance of discouragement with regards to raiding and the meta.  The sentiments we see when we search for reference  all indicate that in vanilla, raiding = meta class and build, no questions about it.
---
If like to ask you, as an experienced vet, back in OG vanilla, where there guilds raiding with more than one spriest, some feral cat druids, arcrane mages, etc?  Everything feels so locked to the meta.  I've actually stressed and lost sleep over it.  I'm going to roll warlock not because they are so amazing, but because after literally months of research, I'm confident I will have little gear competition, and won't have to change my spec all the time for pvp.
---
My first character was a hunter. I didn't really speak any English when i started. I had no idea what anything did in this game, the only thing i knew was that stamina gave me more health because when you equipped something your health went up. 
---
I didn't know what agility did, had no clue what "critical strike" or "hit rating" was because i had no frame of reference or knew what it meant. I though healing meant i could heal for more when eating or something.
---
So the only thing i stacked was stamina. A ring with stamina, healing and spirit? Yeah i was needing on that. Tank ring? That has stamina. Any item with more stamina was an upgrade in my mind. 
---
I was the true definition of a huntard.
---
Can't say I agree. hunter has a large skill cap, because screwing up is so punishing. 1 mistake and now you have melee on you where you will do far less dps. or a caster will be in your deadzone while you do 0 dps.
---
and a lot of it is split second decisions, too, like flaring a rogue as he tries to vanish and get an opener on you. and if you fuck up your cc, you can't just reapply it.
---
Well, shit. Here I was thinking I'd be a good girlfriend and make my boyfriend a "Don't starve to death" care package for launch week. Thank you for saving me from immense cringey shame and dishonor.
---
strength and block vlaue is nearly irrelelevant. It's 20 str for 1 block value, so it takes far too much to get anything out of it.
---
Holy reck is the more reliable reck build, as you can afford to build up full reck bombs. Ret reck has more oomph, but you can't afford to sustain through to build up full reck bombs, so you usually have to settle for double or triple hits.
---
Projecting alot, paying 51% income tax is no joke and am not a fan of it.
---
Somebody should just make a non-meme, non-screenshot wowclassic  sub.
---
Mhm you could also carry some shadow protection potions with you, dont sure if they share cd with healpot but i guess so :/
---
Yeah I do understand that now - we are lucky that we get German/French servers already because there actually seems to be enough need for it.
---
If they don't feel like there is for rpvp then unlucky :/
---
They will find a server they can make their "inofficial" rpvp server
---
Thanks for posting this!
---
yes it is the only way to achieve respectable dps, also making it more engaging than 1 button spams
---
STR and AGI depends on current values of your gear. You want both really, hop in Drood discord, there is plenty of information there [https://discord.gg/5Uw8nZY](https://discord.gg/5Uw8nZY)
---
"hurr durr private server bad" isn't a discussion nor is it half of it. There's legitimate criticism of Skarm in this thread, but not from the users that brainlessly repeat the same sentiment over and over without contributing anything of value to the thread.
---
Well :/ We will never know unless he tells us :D whatever though ;)
---
My memory may be wrong here, but I thought you can’t level up enchanting when you enchant someone else’s gear via trade?
---
I did that. With a Warrior. *Nearly* quit the game when I discovered my error.
---
Well we will find out. Servers got this type of stuff in guess work.
---
They relaunch every 2-3 years, as I already said. Obviously the 2-3 years I mentioned was referring to a single server lifespan.
---
&gt;It was fine on vanilla launch, but we’ll blow through content now
---
No. Raids are limited to once per week each. Still takes months and months to gear an entire guild to be even remotely able to progress the next, harder raid tier.
---
The Classic servers will be absolutely full and alive still within 2-3 years if that is when Naxx comes. It would be stupid to release raids before guilds are even geared for them.
---
I played warlock back in the day and absolutely loved it.  
---
Considering going mage this time around, but I am torn as hell regarding it.
---
Attack Power does help you with every kind of damage you deal(that does scale). Attack Power is directly translated into weapon DPS that is added on top of your weapon's own DPS value.
---
Why does it matter if its BiS? If its not BiS for the priest or druid either, its fair game. If there is like, a strictly better plate version but this is all cloth has to offer, then perhaps you should pass it. But if the difference is only a few points, the plate version may be rarer/ harder to obtain. You dont "just get" the gear because you can only wear cloth, or leather. Sorry.
---
Literally the only change im happy with. If you've been on a pserver for 2 minutes you know why.
---
Not the same. At level 20 the armor difference are negligible. At 49 plate to leather on a non bis item is just flat out not needed. Use ur brain, I don’t need to break this down for you in every way.
---
And you need to farm manual crowd pummelers.
---
Very accurate, it isn't meant to be an end all be all of loot distribution. QSR is a perfect example. Most of the time that should go to a warrior, its worth it more on warriors. All this is a compiling of a BiS list presented in a way that shows length of time the item remains BiS (according to one website). There isn't a loot list to my knowledge that accounts for every gear eccentricity that people are going to run into. But for people who have never played vanilla or on a PServer and they aren't sure how to hand out loot that will benefit the guild the most this is a very very very loose way to do so that makes an iota of sense.
---
I think I started a new hunter every week for a month. I did love leveling in teldrassil so it wasn't a complete loss.
---
Huh, how bad? I love their look :(
---
What racism
---
Warlock main the majority of my WoW career, but I have always been a fan of DiscPriest but I know Holy is the raid heal spec for vanilla.
---
I played the stress test and literally noticed no difference. Don’t know what y’all are talking about, everything worked just like is always has.
---
Unpopular opinion: blizzard should never have wasted time on classic bexause y’all just keep complaining a bout everything
---
Disenchanting skill gains cap out around 65 skill or something, I forget the exact number.
---
12-15 hours a week - hmm lets say you are only focused on leveling and not professions or other fun things - 15 hours a week should take you about 13 weeks to hit level 60.
---
After that you'll have to either join a group that will take you for MC, or gear up through dungeons - some dungeon runs will be 90 minutes.
---
So all in all, you'll be able to play the game 100% - just not hardcore raid.
---
Somebody should just make a classicwow sub where memes, screenshots and IRL-related posts aren't allowed. I'm not active and knowledgeable enough about Reddit to make one.
---
/u/OG_Goob  make one, I'll contribute.
---
&lt;Doggo Noir&gt; would be great for you man. I sent you a PM with some more details.
---
ty for scam
---
Thinking about those times you have to stop and organize your bank/bags/inventory. I'm imagining doing that with a 400ms delay on everything.
---
/bloodyvomit
---
Who in the hell runs Necropolis maps. Awful layout, always have to backtrack because you missed an entire section in the beginning.
---
Not much different from moderated forums we used back then. If you want a free chat such as IRC, there's Discord.
---
cat durid is 4 fite
---
I was buying white weapons from the vendor
---
I totally get that, in fact that's the very first thing I said, it's a nice guideline! I do think that it's important to remind less experienced players to make sure they take it as just that though, a guideline.
---
It’s okey. Read a book or something.
---
Depends very much on what you play. In PvP you actually have a lot of different specs, which all use shapeshifting a ton in combat. It will not be uncommon to use cat, bear and travel form all several times in a fight, and between that cast some healing spells, cc or even damage spells if you are a balance hybrid.
---
Heavy feral builds will stick more to cat, being their main damage. Balance hybrid will try to stay a bit more out in caster form, but even they use cat for some damage, but rely a bit more on bear to soak and travel to run, then try to get a few spells off.
---
In PvE, less so. As a feral your rotation consist of "abusing" Wolfshead Helm" and "Furor" (talent). Together those grant you 60 energy when you shapeshift into cat form. So you can empty your energy, then shapeshift out and back in to instantly generate Energy. Essentially you convert mana into energy during the fight, but you don't really do much of the cool "shapeshifting to fit the moment". That is mostly in PvP. You can see some use as a tank as well, but never did druid tanking in vanilla, so not the best to talk about that experience.
---
You think it’s strictly just a gear issue? Or the class design itself.
---
this. this needs to stay a neckbeard sub. people with GFs can go and play retail.
---
While herbalism is great for many things, you're not going to need Fadeleaf. Pickpocketing macros will give you more than enough Blinding Power.
---
"90% accurate replica"...Yeah sure..
---
Buddy you either did the winter spring after vanilla or you’re lying - there is absolutely no fucking way you did it in 30 hours. 
---
In later expansions yeah when they changed it - during vanilla that shit took forever.
---
That's been confirmed yes, I'm talking about the TCG loot cards though. The original 3 were redeemable before TBC, prior to Landro you could redeem them online and they were mailed.
---
How will barrens chat be in the current political climate though... I might just have to NOT join /world and hide out on discord with the sane people :D
---
More time for snacks
---
Duel aside, you can't die if they can't hit you. And you outrange them by 6 yards and dot don't proc the daze. If you engage a priest or a warlock in 1v1 world PvP and got feared you did something wrong. In addition, you could exploit this agaisnt warlock if you have engi, because most warlock out of despair will cast death coil once they are in reach, and you can easily shadow reflect the spell if you let them get in range.
---
I'm on the fence about classic. I'll only be leveling one character probably. I played and play the same Paladin since 2004, he was holy/ret in vanilla. I'd like to do that again, but I think it might be better to go prot warrior for group play. Can't decide.
---
I wonder, what are you doing here? There is no reason to be excited ... so no reason for you to waste your time on fan reddit?
---
As they will probably level quicker than you, I would also say to pick a character that would enable your leveling speed. Likely a warlock, hunter,  or possibly mage (they get quicker with more gear when they can start aoe farming. That is, if  you don't have a preference  on character. I would also  highly recommend  checking out [Joana's leveling guide](https://www.joanasworld.com/azeroth.htm) to help you keep up with them and help  suggest where to  go  next.
---
Thats what should happen tbh, take a pvp server and organize communities onto there
---
That's a lot of life to give up for some purples.
---
The problem is vanilla graphics on lowest is alot different from retail graphics on lowest.
---
I think there's a case you didn't mention that should be added.  The case of the overly geared character who is only joining the run for 1 specific item, and nothing else.  I've done runs where I've been with far lesser geared group members who roll on everything that drops for them, which is fine because they need those items.  But then the one and only thing I needed from that run drops, and those people who already got 2-3 items in that run are now rolling against me the only item I came for in the first place.
---
Doesn't really seem all that fair.
---
The tried and true ret tactic of HoJing and running at them.
---
The problem is when the moped is less fun. Players will always optimize the fun out of the game.
---
This is the correct answer to all questions/posts on this sub with the word "Druid" in them.  Every form is like a tool in your kit, using it at the appropriate time for maximum lethality/utility/healing and repeat as needed for ultimate fun :)
---
doesn't hoj only work for melee, though? I'm no sure when that change happened, but I remember there being no reason to get it
---
Human rogues can still benefit from Maladath if they go seal fate spec.
---
How is a mount guaranteed at 40?  Mage doesn't have a class quest as far as I'm aware.
---
When you MC a mob, does their damage count as your dps on the chart ?
---
Sure but everyone has everything below AQ on farm. Gear isnt a big deal for MC, BWL or ony. By month 3 everyone will be full gear and ready for AQ if they are really trying
---
Or if they break the tos and account share lol
---
Dodging early on pull can make rage and therefore threat generation more annoying, but that's about it.
---
I love the way rage works. I hate mana, and energy management never felt that great to me, although I can see why someone else would enjoy it.
---
Rage is the best class resource, hands down. Runes and runic power were ok, but mostly because the WotlK era DK was totally faceroll, so it never mattered that much what you pressed at the level of play I did. Every spec was tank spec.
---
This one isn’t entirely my fault, but my dad told me that rogue was the class that got to turn into animals. I leveled a rogue until 18, just to find out it was actually druids... I was really disappointed. Had to start a whole new character and level back up, which took me quite a while cause I was like 12 at the time lol.
---
This isn’t rocket science. If the item is a reasonable upgrade then it’s fair game. This isn’t like a hunter rolling on an awesome melee weapon just for the stat boost, this is literally boost your primary stats for dps which is needed when leveling. Not the extra .5% damage mitigation or whatever the armor difference would give. Obviously there are situations where it’s wrong, but given the level, the item, and the classes involved, to just say the warrior is a ninja for rolling is baseless when the item is bis at that level for once again I repeat ALL MELEE, then you can’t fault someone for wanting it. I even have a twink warrior wearing those pants. It’s a freaking level 19 item that gets replaced by killing the last gnomer boss once...
---
What are some cool MC tricks besides  AB farm or MC into lava/ off boats ?
---
There are lot of class specific resources, but not many aggregates.
---
I loved mind controlling dungeons.

Haven’t seen many, so I’ll go. I love being a mage! I was considering rolling a Druid instead, but deep down in my soul I’m always going to be a mage. Teleportation, portals, conjuring food and water, blinking (teleporting a few ft in front of you), all the cc, all the aoe, all the burst, all the damage, I just love it all.
---
Leveling is also fun, especially when you’re able to use that mad aoe damage. Sheeping people is fun. Loved it when I got my pig book and was able to pig people. (Hopefully this was classic still)
---
POM Pyro is fun to play with at least once.
---
I’m sure I’m missing a lot but that’s what I could think of atm. Would love to see some more mages up in here
---
Tier 1 is only good for warrior tanks and hunters (if you have the full 8/8 set) the stats are just bad for other classes, or you can find better gear from DM or other high level dungeons. It’s a shame but that’s how it is.
---
Can i get just the subscription? I went to the store but didnt know what to buy
---
To add to that,  it also will help  to get  first aid leveled then you can aoe farm humanoids for extra cloth  easier because you have the first aid  heal to help  you.
---
Just because someone mentions fortnite doesn't mean they hate it.
---
But I suppose only thinking one way is what reddit and gaming communities are all about &lt;3
---
First off, have you SEEN our website?! It’s sooo legit and has been worked on by one of our members (Kudos Vestia!). That alone should get you’re curiosity going. Check it out after reading this comment. DO ITTTTT :) 
---
Besides all the good stuff mentioned above, we plan to have a lot of fun. We’re in it for the long haul, which is something you should be looking for in a Classic guild. We’re not just planning for MC, we’re looking well beyond that. Our loot system is EPGP which is really fair compared to other systems out there.  
---
I’m legitimately sooo pumped to run dungeons for pre-raid gear, raiding all the end-level content, wPvP, world bosses, BG’s etc with the people at Get of Fenris. Come jump in our discord and see what we’re all about. Tell em Scythe sent ya, or give me a hearty hello in discord! Looking forward to playing with ya future adventurer! :D
---
Be like water my friend. This some Bruce Lee stuff you just said
---
Ok im the lead of a group of friends, we are arround 20, but i dont feel like recluting or doing the hard part rn, so we all already enroll on a guild and the plan is to just take over that guild and be the leaders if they resist we just backstab them gquiting 20+ and taking the best players with us and then we just recluit 5-8 morr and we are set.
---
I have done this several times, it always works
---
Upon getting my Firestone spell on my warlock, my dumbass assumes "Oh, warlock is supposed to be a hybrid class! Melee and spells!".
---
I then equip my strongest Vanquisher's Sword and proceed to level my friends through Wailing Caverns at the speed of smell as my Voidwalker tanks and I slap things for 50 damage +6fire damage.
---
I was so proud.
---
I've always played dwarf and am very familiar with Dun Morough. tbh I'm just recreating my current main on WoW Classic. Stoneform is also great.
---
Online communities were way more toxic back in the day. I'm surprised at how much better they are after only 10 years. Society in general is more tolerant and conscientious but definitely less likely to interact, which includes negative interactions.
---
Yes, but at the cost of health which is annoying when leveling warrior, Druid can at least heal and can pre enrage before the pull so that the armor is negligible.
---
You still alt tab to watch on a separate monitor. The point is that the faster your run is, the more time you have to do something else. Which is better than having to actively run for longer.
---
Ya I was in the top guild on our server for Vanilla. We'd only have someone as Disc if it was something like Kazzak, only one of the green dragons, Azuregos. That was it until Naxx. Can't change spec easily as you can now so if you were Priest you were expected to go Holy to all raids unless our class lead told someone to switch.
---
Have you been retired since 2004?
---
I have owned gaming mouses for the aesthetic, but I'll be honest I've never gotten around to actually using the extra buttons.
---
Does it not count as a beast? What type is it?
---
same here.
---
My parents got me that WoW mouse years ago, besides it lighting up and looking pretty cool I didn't have much of a use for it.
---
We just had all our DPS warriors pop berserker rage for fears and the highest threat ones had macros to sword and board.
---
^^ yea buff cap
---
From what I've read, yes, you only need the subscription. Not sure if the base game is needed to activate it, but it sounds like you already have that so you should be good.
---
T2,5 gloves eh?
---
ODST!
---
For your next trick you should go into r/baking and look for a post sharing a cookie recipe.  Tell them how much better muffins are to cookies.  When they tell you they prefer cookies and intended the post to be for other people who like cookies, lecture them on how entitled they are and how reddit is a public forum for anyone to comment, while accusing them of trying to silence commenters.
---
Also, if they make the generalized intuitive statement that people who bake cookies like cookies, accuse them of having no tolerance for people who like muffins.
---
Swifty did a video of his set up and goes in depth on how he uses his orbweaver. [Video](https://youtu.be/BhQzy29UKA8)
---
Tried to do some digging for other sources. Found one that, while not mentioning diaries by name, mentions vendor trash at 1-2.5s each. If it was 45s each I’m sure it would’ve been mentioned in an article about pickpocketing for gold. Dates 6/28/2005

I will be traveling for work in the future. I dont know my specific rules about what I can and cant install on my work computer, but id like to be able to play wow on it without triggering a big red flag that im installing a blizzard client on my computer. 
---
Questions: can i play classic by installing as little as possible, maybe remote to my laptop at home. Or is there a way to hide my installs from work, or what kind of things set off security alarms. 
---
As you can see i dont know enough to give all the details or suggest a solution so any advice or if you have information i need to find out for myself that would help a lot. Thanks
---
Honestly, it should be!
---
So much utility
---
I feel like I got a trick for every situation and I'll do just fine; whether PVP, soloing, 5 mans or raids.
---
If they go back to the roots of rpgs and "difficulty" of classic, this new audience that loves instant gratification and loot piñatas will freak out and riot on the forums. Its better to leave retail as an arcade game and focus on classic to real rpg gamers.
---
To start out, after alot of research, you really can't go wrong either way. Now with that said, here's the rundown imo:
---
Undead have ToW, DP, and WotF. Trolls have SG, Hex, Berserking. 
---
Berserking and ToW are very niche not worth talking about the implications.  (ToW spam is a thing but again I find it very niche)
---
Hex is simply a mediocre healing debuff but basically costs you nothing at all so it's a plus in every fight. 
---
DP is almost as powerful as SWP and has a 100% healing component to it. Only downsides are high mana cost(can be completely negated by Inner Focus) and 3m CD so it's not up all the time. 
---
WotF is fucking brilliant basically. Frees up trinket slot or allows use of pvp trinket on polly/stuns. 
---
SG by all counts of people who have tried it is fucking brilliant as well. Triggers on any form of damage taken, low mana cost, great spell dmg coefficients, no cd, procs shadow weaving, and most importantly procs blackout (basically you cast 1 spell for 3 chances of proccing blackout which is really good)
---
Undead have more favorable matchups against warlocks and priests specifically because of WotF. Trolls have more favorable matchups versus warriors and rogues especially. 
---
DP also helps out undead versus more classes but because it's more commonly paired with Inner Focus, it's also important to note that Trolls make up for that by using Inner Focus on Mindblast for increased crit chance so I believe it balances out somewhat. 
---
I'm going troll personally, hate long CDs and Cd management in general and almost always prefer a useful spell that is always available
---
Go hop on a private server and just listen to Barrens chat and even world chat for 10 minutes. Half is about the game if you're lucky and the rest is political and racist BS. Call me a SJW all you want but there plenty of places to go or own channel if you want to talk about all that bullshit.
---
So are Tier 3 Rogues. Very viable for tanking.
---
Still, no guild sane in the head would actually use a Rogue as their tank.
---
Druids are viable...but still far bellow Prot Warriors in all aspects.
---
"Don't be afraid to kick people who are disruptive to the guild or cause drama." absolutely. I was way too lenient when I guild led a raiding guild on a pserver, because I wanted to be "nice", but all it did was allow people who were assholes get away with it for too long. This isn't a job, they are no workers rights or unions, if someone is being an asshole constantly just kick them
---
You can also assign this task to an officer
---
I'm confused why would you want to bother leveling a low level pet when a high level pet would work fine? If you're level 60, just tame a level 60 pet (or level 50+). Are there any pets that you would want that are not already level 50+ in the wild?
---
Idk what to say man, I disagree completely.  Druids in shit gear might be closer to wars but they scale into more threat lie crazy as their gear gets better.  Bwl+ with mcp isn't even close.
---
My roommate tried to swim from Tirisfal to Barrens because I was in Mulgore.  He swam so far it ressed him there because it was the default when you died out of bounds.
---
In TBC it was off the chain: "CLICK THE ALTAR FOR HEALTHSTONES EVERYONE"
---
rogue mage
---
That's not going to happen at all. 400ms is the figure people refer to with regards to spell batching. Not world, interface, npc interactions etc. Only spell batching.
---
What's wrong with not wanting to see that bullshit in game? The game is an escape from the drudgery of daily life.There's plenty of places to go if you want to talk about that crap.
---
Same dilemma here. Three kids, busy job (luckily finished my PhD 10 years ago) but I love tanking. Will be playing 20 hours per week max. Will probably go for a priest as this will make life much easier
---
This is arguably the most insightful comment on here and I will take it to heart, I foresee this being a huge issue in many guilds. Thanks!
---
Vurtne
---
Gaming mice are absolutely fantastic and I can’t imagine playing an mmo without one.
---
I had something very similar to an Orbweaver at one point and never found any use for it and couldn’t get used to it for anything.
---
I started my wow career as a noob warlock
---
Around level 18 I was rocking cool sword of white quality that I got from vendor, because my class could equip it. I boosted its damage with firestone (warlock thing) to give it moar oomph and slayed many gnolls in wesfall on my quest for woolcloth
---
I haven't tried one of those because I haven't needed to. A regular \~10 button mouse is plenty for me. I've raid healed with a standard 3 button mouse (takes some modifier keys though) and don't recommend it, but I don't need a full action bar for my thumb alone. I've heard people with bigger fingers have a hard time not fat-fingering the wrong button, so read the reviews and see if either mouse has this problem.
---
On a related note, with my CM Storm Inferno dead can anybody recommend a gaming mouse that doesn't look like a Michael Bay transformer?
---
Since when do Warriors and Rogues have equal priority for 1h swords? Rogues definitely have a higher priority than Warriors because Warriors have no chance in hell of catching up in DPS with Rogues until Naxx.
---
i like to sneak around
---
It's a video game, take them for yourself.
---
Just changing form when you need resources, people love to give names to things in wow to feel like they are skilled or something.
---
Lul, is this a troll post?
---
Nothing will happen, every subreddits mods are awful and allow this shit despite people not wanting it. It becomes a snowball effect because allowing it pushes away people who hate it, and soon enough all that's left is karma farming shitposting casuals.
---
Warrior;
---
Pros: Can easily tank any dungeon 1-60, even if you're leveling as any DPS spec, which makes it very, very easy to get into any dungeon you want or need. Best tanks in the game @ 60. Arguably the highest melee DPS in the game with Fury. Some of the best PvP'ers in the game with Arms. Can equip every weapon in the game. Can equip every armor type in the game. Absolute beasts @ lvl 60, no matter which role/spec you choose to pursue. You are literally the "best" class in the game.
---
Cons: The worst and hardest levelers in the game. Very noob unfriendly. Difficult rotations, Tanking is NOT a breeze like in retail, no self-healing and feels surprisingly squishy/low damage while leveling. Literally the worst possible 1-59 experience imaginable. 
---
Very strong class overall.
---
Rogue;
---
Pros: Arguably the highest melee DPS in the game. Great gankers/PvP'ers. Stealth is good for leveling/questing. High damage, decent mobility, surprisingly tanky. VERY FUN 1-59. Noob friendly, with fairly easy leveling/questing. Fun class quests. Great class fantasy/rp.
---
Cons: You're class-specific skills are double-edged swords. Poison-making is a skill that must be ranked up and costs a LOT of gold buying mats to rank it up, esp for a first toon/fresh launched server. Huge money sink. Lockpicking is a total PITA ranking up, sitting at one lock box in STV for 4 hours opening it over and over again. Huge time sink. Other than that, not too many cons. 
---
Mage;
---
Pros: Great and easy levelers. Able to craft your own food/water (saves TONS of Gold in the long run). Very mobile, strong PVP, City portals are great for getting around, highest DPS in the game from early on through end game, Polymorph is a blessing in any 5 man dungeon as well as PVP, always a welcome addition to any group, literally the best dps class in the game overall.
---
Cons: Boring as fuck. Your rotation from lvl 1 until AQ40+ is Frostbolt, Frostbolt, Frostbolt. Eventually it switches to Fireball. Everyone will be asking for portals/food/water. 
---
Priest;
---
Pros: Very strong healers, can heal any dungeon 1-59 as Shadow Spec with ease making it very easy to find any group/dungeon you need. Benediction, Resurrection, Mind Control, surprisingly fast/easy and efficient levelers, Shadow is the strongest PVP spec in the game
---
Cons: If you don't like healing, don't pick this class. Also very immobile. 
---
Hunter;
---
Pros: The best levelers, you'll solo shit that would require other classes 3+ people to conquer, strong dps 1-59 and early game @ 60, Aspect of the motherfucking Cheetah, very easy and noob friendly, strong in WPVP/ganking, always necessary in every raid for Tranq Shot/traps.
---
Cons: Piss-poor damage compared to others in late-game content, pet control is absolute garbage in Vanilla, you'll probably wipe your group and be called a huntard multiple times. 
---
Warlock;
---
Pros: Very strong levelers, you'll solo shit that would require other classes 3+ people to conquer, free fucking mount @ 40, dope ass class quests, very easy and noob friendly, strong in WPVP/ganking, summons are a god-send, nearly impossible to die, fun class with good utility. 
---
Cons: Piss-poor damage compared to others in late-game content, no threat control, boring Shadowbolt spam rotation, pet control is absolute garbage in Vanilla.
---
Druid;
---
Pros: Second-best levelers in the game, and can match or beat a hunter to 60. Motherfucking Travel Form. Stealth.  Can easily tank any dungeon 1-60, even if you're leveling as any DPS spec, which makes it very, very easy to get into any dungeon you want or need. Can easily heal any dungeon too. Very strong WPvP/gankers. High damage 1-59. Amazing tanks @ 60. Battle Rez. Best WSG flag carrier in the game.
---
Cons: If you don't like healing don't pick this class. But, you're also the worst healer in the game @ 60 compared to other classes. Water Form class quest. No normal resurrect, only a 30 min CD Battle Rez. Feral DPS/Balance DPS is non-existent @ 60. If Feral tank, will be overshadowed by the Thunderfury-rocking Warrior MT. 
---
Paladin;
---
Pros: Two viable leveling specs - Ret and Prot. Best healers in the game @ 60. Ret is amazing for PVP @ 60 and for WPVP. Prot is very fun for leveling and tanking 5 mans. Amazing buffs. Cool class quests. Free mount @ 40. Great class fantasy/rp. Resurrection. Blessing of Freedom. Noob friendly class.
---
Cons: If you don't like healing, don't pick this class. Slow, boring levelers - second only to Warriors.  Ret DPS and Prot Tanking is non-existent @ 60. You'll be spamming buffs all raid long, every single raid night.
---
Shaman;
---
Pros: Ghost fucking wolf. WF weapon/totem. Chain heal. Cool class quests for the most part. Free hearthstone on a 15min CD. Can easily heal any dungeon 1-58 in any spec. Strong easy leveling. Noob friendly class. Ele/Resto hybrid spec is very strong for PvP @ 60, and does massive damage.
---
Cons: If you don't like healing, don't pick this class. Water Totem class quest. Ele/Enh DPS is non-existent @ 60. People only want you for your WF and Mana Spring totems. 
---
You're a piece of shit.
---
I'm gonna mostly be playing with my buddy who is rolling shadow priest. I've been planning on rolling warrior but I've been having second thoughts, I played warrior originally during classic/tbc and might want to try something new. What else has good PvP synergy with spriest?
---
There's a leatherworking helm that gives +20 energy when you shift into cat form and a talent that gives +20 energy when you shift into cat form.  When you use both you can dump to 0 energy then shift out of and back into cat form to get energy back and do more damage until you're oom.
---
They have many advantages, slows, stuns, cc, ranged attacks. All we need is CHOP.
---
band of accuria is tank priority, it should never go to a hunter period
---
People are saying mage T1 isn’t good.
---
I’m is before PvP gear is released- that’s not to say it’s insanely good, but it is the best we’ll have for a bit, and when PvP gear comes out you won’t have it on the first week.
---
Tier 2 for mage is actually amazing though- yes it is lacking in stamina, but that’s compared to the rank 13 gear. IMO especially with the 5 set that increases most AOE spells radiuses by 25% it’s the next best thing to R13 for general use by a mage in PvP- high damage, good set bonuses, good (not amazing) Stam, and a ton of int.
---
Your metaphor doesn't fit because we're both talking about the same topic.
---
You said we should have Classic+ rather than TBC classic. I disagreed and stated my reasons (and broke down some of what was wrong with your post). You then claimed I'm not your audience.
---
This is a public forum. Everyone who reads the topic is your audience.
---
You don't get to dictate the conversation. Get over yourself.
---
**&lt;You Think You Do&gt; - NA - Horde - PVP**
---
***Priority / Purpose:*** Raiding with the intent of clearing all the content when all is said and done. We also want to be social and get to know one another. The core group of the guild has been around for the past 2-3 years doing other Legacy Guilds on retail.
---
***Raid Times (EST):*** 8-11, days TBD. We are going to be raiding on the weekends, either Fri/Sat/Sun or Sat/Sun/Mon. The third night will be optional and will be filled with pugs as necessary. There are also plans for alt raids during the weekdays. Loot will also be distributed via Loot Council.
---
***Contact***: Discord. My profile is Bevok#1264, you could also contact our GM on his Discord which is Muff#9531. Here's a link to our discord server as well: [https://discord.gg/emyuBfn](https://discord.gg/emyuBfn)
---
***Rules / Expectations:*** There is a time and a place for all kinds of humor. Know your audience. Be respectful to those who have expressed comments. We have NSFW channels for memes and the like for those who want to run a little more rampant.
---
***About Us / Intro:*** We are a group of excited individuals to restart the classic WoW experience and play through the new classic vanilla servers when they go live! This guild will be a culmination of the hard work of many of the leaders we currently have. We had roots started in a guild called &lt;EVOLVE&gt; on Emerald Dream where we performed legacy content at their intended levels on live servers all the way through Throne of Thunder at level 90. We attempted a restart on Nesingwary in a guild called &lt;Ad Initio&gt; when numbers started to dwindle, but then ultimately merged with another guild called &lt;You Think You Do&gt; on Wyrmrest Accord. The leaders of this guild are experienced in the older content and have either actual Classic raiding experience or a great depth of knowledge of the old expansions. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions!
---
Maybe it isn't, or maybe the people who're participating in the online Classic community months before release are a good representation of those who'll play the game long term. The same survey did a lot of rounds around the Blizzard forums too.
---
On the retail side of things, it's a much different ecosystem now (and then) than Classic is.
---
Not saying you're wrong, it's a fair point - data from either source should be taken with a grain of salt. And I daresay Blizzard agrees with you, I don't doubt they've seen the survey.
---
Go watch Perplexity and tell me it's anything other than a rogue. There is a general cookie cutter success to a few of these classes in most encounters or situations. Rogues definitely have the most tools.
---
Gotcha, after looking back I noticed the parenthesis around it.  I'd agree, if you AoE grind often you should have the money for the mount.
---
nothing to do with you using it or not though, it's taking the item without due process from the rest of the group (amounting to theft, just using a different name)
---
We need a stickied daily help thread for people to post questions like this so they are all contained in one place.
---
Use your imagination on what is something only rogues can get in phase 6!
---
There are some old YT videos. Happy hunting!
---
Prob warcraftmovies.com  that was the OG place but it’s kind of weird now when I go to the site.
---
A fair comparison in the case of something like stockade's.  Weapons are on a completely different level.
---
Most of the people you'll be playing with aren't going to have all the gear that is available for them in the future (let alone other classes) mapped out. It's just, is this an upgrade or not
---
As if I could forget. Listen, u/exarion607, there's something about the cringe you should know. Oh no. It's too late. These people have all been infected. They may look fine now, but it's a matter of time before they turn into the cringe.
---
Of course they do. In your mind, a warrior can only roll on plate. Can't roll on mail if there is a hunter. Can't roll on leather if there is a rogue. 
---
That is ridiculous. There is a reason that warriors are able to wear all types of armor. Leather gear is not reserved for rogues. It never has been. Noone plays like this, so you better get used to it.

---
Ha ha! OP thinks I’ve picked a main class!
---
 Explain to me why something that is an equal upgrade for a warrior and rogue should go to the rogue simply because it is leather.
---
FYI, other classes besides priests can mind control with engineering and [Gnomish Mind Control Cap](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10726/gnomish-mind-control-cap).
---
Rolling priest for mind control would be like rolling shaman for water walking when you can pop an elixir. Or lock for unending breath when you can use Hydrocane. Or rogue for lockpicking when you could just make keys with blacksmithing.
---
Those aren't completely accurate analogies; I am trying some IRL mind control to keep the priest population down for entirely selfish reasons!
---
How do you people remember this dumb shit
---
And you wait to shift until right before your next regen tick so you actually have 80 energy to spend
---
The only thing I’ve found an orbweaver good for is old games where scroll was tied to the arrow keys and shortcuts to WASD.  It now sits on my parts shelf collecting dust since I don’t play those enough to worry about it.  
---
Multi-button mice with huge amounts of buttons are garbage as well.  In particular I had a naga crap out on me.  Swore off Razer for that and their demand you install their software and log in.  Way more trouble than it’s worth.  
---
That said, the ones with just 2 buttons under the thumb are actually really good for those instances where you wish you had another mouse button or two.  They’re also super cheap because they get marketed as a fancy back/forward browser buttons for normies.
---
Druids are definitely really tough to play optimally in PVP...I think the reason that it doesn't seem that way is that (sadly) in Vanilla, even a great druid just isn't as effective or dominating as a lot of other classes, at either a healing or damage role. 
---
Back in the day, this changed dramatically in TBC, where druids became undeniable gods of pvp.
---
It is fair if you did not state up front your intentions.  But then again, others may see it as being fair no matter what.  Me personally, if someone states they are there for only one item cause they out gear the place, then sure, have at it.  I won't roll.
---
Oh so being thoughtful and respectful towards other players is considered douche bag-y these days?
---
Awesome Classic community indeed. 
---
And please, don't try to insult someone and then say "lolomegalul"...
---
Druids can do it too in vanilla
---
Remote play will be fine for inventory management, auction house stuff, light travel, and profression things, but the lag will be too much to try to do anything combat related. At least this was my experience trying to remotely control FFXIV.
---
Yeah. With the hit changes from p servers hunters are gonna be looking to shed hit from those builds, since it's pretty easy to hit cap as a hunter.
---
Because it was a popular transmog item. My rogue's pvp set was full Bloodfang + Perdition's Blade and Core Hound Tooth.
---
Tauren get a 5% stamina racial vs +1% dodge for Night Elf.
---
However Night Elf can get 10% Stamina and Agility from blessing of kings in addition to the 1% dodge.
---
Shaman don't really have anything comparable I don't think. They have a +agility totem which is useful and they have +25% armor buff after crit heals but alliance priests can also do that so it's not unique.
---
&gt;The majority of the content is raid content
---
lol no it isn't
---
I'm not saying you can't disagree with me.  The issue started when you pushed back on the idea that Cata killed WoW.  Obviously not everyone is going to agree with that statement.  I don't know why I need to put that disclaimer in there.
---
However, there are tons of people who do think that, as I do.  And it's reasonable to assume that a disproportionate amount of people who preferred Vanilla over BFA are of that opinion.  My position is of that opinion.  My target audience is people of that opinion.  People who like Cata, or Legion, or BFA, or whatever can continue liking it, my post has nothing to do with any of that.  I'm never going to persuade them and I don't want to.
---
Having to throw up a disclaimer before every sentence I make of "Now you may disagree but this is just my opinion, but..." is tiresome and dumb.  But then people like you come along calling that "entitlement".
---
That is absolutely not true. Warriors are completely incapable of reaching as high DPS as Rogues until Naxx gear. Through MC all the way to AQ40, Rogues are significantly better DPS than Warriors.
---
Request: ragnaros agi cloak.
---
?? I've been playing on Pservers since Nost, most recently on ND. I've NEVER seen a fucking warrior roll need against a hunter/shaman/druid/rogue on a big leather drop. Ever. Unless it's specifically pre-raid BiS @ 58+.
---
I've never seen a 40+ hunter roll against a rogue/druid tank on leather, unless it was specifically his BiS. 
---
You're so full of shit lmao.
---
Weird to see the comments here.
---
I was under the assumption that ninja looting required control of the loot and then abusing that power.  So having something on Masterloot and then on a boss kill you bypass rules/rolls and loot the items yourself/to friends and leave.. which happened a lot with things like expensive BoEs/Rivendare's Mount/Raid drops.
---
Or.. it was common to do a, "everyone pass and we'll sort it after" - but someone would roll need, loot it, then hearth.
---
The ambiguous stuff I'm seeing in the comments is really surprising to me and would never carry the same weight that being called a ninja looter would have back in the day.
---
Healing in vanilla is quite easy, most of the deep holy talents are garbage, so PI is the way to go
---
I had Perdition's Blade + CHT for the better part of a year in Vanilla. Not difficult to remember something you looked at every single day for that long.

World PvP is never really fair. I dont think you should ever expect world pvp to have fair fights. Before battlegrounds are released, all pvp will take place via world pvp. The fairest world pvp i would expect to happen via the famous southshore vs. tarren mill location, which will just be one mob vs the other mob. Once battlegrounds are released, all meaningful fair pvp will take place in battlegrounds, especially with rank 7+ pvpers because battlegrounds are so much more efficient in gaining pvp ranks than world pvp. World pvp will happen, but not as any meaningful way to progress through the pvp ranks to higher levels. After battlegrounds are released, world pvp will exist, but as a general rule it will mostly be unorganized and just for casual fun ganking (on pvp realms). Granted, you will occasionally see an organized group go out into world pvp and mass kill everything in their way (city raids or barrens crossroads raid, etc). But those are nowhere near fair. it's just mass killing 40 raid vs 1 or something.
---
around there correct BUT im talking about De the items you get from solo dungeons and using those mats to bump you skill.
---
What kind of world content are we talking about here?  If you plan on questing solo you should do it as a dps spec and just have an int set for healing.  Any class with heals can heal 5 mans with whatever random int gear you've collected.
---
Ok so the warrior takes the feral tank's Agi Leather chest peice, and 10 minutes later into the dungeon a +str + stam plate chest drops. Should the Druid roll need against the fucking warrior? Because I sure as fuck would. You're just full of shit at this point.
---
It's ok for rogues too.
---
Keyboard turner.
---
Played Priest, no addons or anything.  Had all my spells bound to numpad keys and would target party members using F2-F5 and then whatever hotkey on the numpad.  
---
My Fade spell on hotbar was a macro that did /helpme and cast Fade so I could spam it when I pulled aggro. 
---
Despite this, I somehow had a good reputation as a healer on my server.
---
I think it's because a lot of people had no idea what they were doing, and a lot more players were younger and still in school. People had free time, people were learning together. It was a new experience for millions of people. Everyone was just having fun and trying to figure it all out.
---
Now everyone has all the information they need at a Google search. No one wants to help, you can find out anything you need online by yourself. It's all about min-maxing and mo one has time to teach someone else how to play a game that's 15 years old. It's an Elitist Jerk's world out there now and its every man for himself.

It's not SJW hysteria wanting your world chat to not be a racist shithole. Have you ever played on a private server?

**\[Blackrock Candy Co.\]**\[H\]\[UsWest\]\[Pvp\]\[Tues Thurs 6-10pm PST\]  
---
   
---
 **Introduction:**  
---
 Blackrock candy Co. is a mostly casual, semi hard-core raiding guild focused on clearing raid content as efficiently as possible while maintaining a fun raiding atmosphere.   We aspire to build an extraordinary, camaraderie based community that mutually respects our members not just as gamers, but as people.  We want the player, not the class. However, if you want world firsts or to be the top everything, everywhere, at all times, this is probably not the guild for you.  This is more like a Health Department B+ rated restaurant.  You know they don't clean their bathrooms enough, but the graffiti in the stalls is hilarious, and the food is worth the risk.  
---
 **Expectations:**  
---
 Come prepared.  Show up early to a raid night with consumables.  Know your rotation, curses, buffs etc.  We are looking for eager, active, skilled, friendly players that possess a sense of humor, the ability to not be offended easily, and want to help us grow into a fun, camaraderie based, B+ rated restaurant. New and veteran players alike are welcome to apply.  
---
 **Role Availability:**

 Thank you and we hope to hear from you soon!
---
Say you have 8 mages in your raid.
---
You know that 4 of them need a particular drop from the boss you are about to kill.
---
You need to determine how you are going to handle it if that loot drops ahead of time, making sure the mages are all in agreement.
---
You can do DKP
---
You can do loot rotation (Mage A gets it this time if it drops, no matter what)
---
You can do /roll
---
Loot council can determine it based on performance/attendance
---
Whatever you do, it should be planned ahead of time so no one starts bickering. Get loot done swiftly, raids take long enough as is.
---
No data supports that at this time. Perhaps I’m wrong (along with the rest of the Internet) and you’re right. Wouldn’t be nice not to have warriors rule the top of charts for entirety of classic.
---
Yes. There might be another later, but there's not going to be one this Thursday.
---
here they come
---
There is lag in the retail game.  About the same amount, even worse in low lvl areas.  If you make a new worgen, it's almost unplayable.  Often 2 second delays on looting and quest windows, even spell casts.
---
Oh you're right, his drop is green. But it's still wanted by all casters at that level.  Not including it implies that he drops nothing or worth.

True, true, ok noted. Thanks

So I could heal as a dps spec in 5 man's even at max level? What about mob farming at higher levels?
---
I got the 34" 2K 144hz Unltrawide from LG. It's worth it if it's in your budget. I would not recommend buying it if it takes you a year to pay off though, even if you do a 0% APR financing. Their hope is you miss one payment and owe all of the interest to them from the beginning. 
---
https://www.amazon.com/LG-34GK950F-B-34-21-Ultragear/dp/B0798Q8KG4
---
I actually don’t think it influences the Retail game at all. 
---
What I do think is people that enjoy the Classic type of game will probably pop into Pantheon when it opens up and play that, as long as the story and gameplay are there and similar.
---
That would give this demographic the “game with a future” that Classic really doesn’t have past AQ currently.
---
Losing those subs then might make Blizzard see issues but would be too late to change.
---
Fun is subjective. I love healing. To me, raid healing and 5 man healing and pvp healing is the most fun thing to do in the game. I also plan on playing Horde. That's why I'm rolling a Priest. If I were going to play Alliance, I'd make a Paladin in a heartbeat. 
---
That said, healing aside, the most "fun" classes in Vanilla that don't heal are straight up Rogue and Warlock. And I tried/played every class to at least the 30s+.
---
So take that for what it's worth.
---
This. I will also be maining a Paladin simply because it's as close to a bard that I can get. Solo questing? I'll bash the living sht out of mobs with my hammer/sword/axe. Group content? Well, if there's no healer then I'll be the healer, if there's no tank then I'll be the tank(up to a certain point). PvP? I'll be annoying af and nearly impossible to kill. On top of that, the sheer amount of great class fantasy.
---
&gt; TBC added flying or Wrath added LFG, if these changes are good or bad is entirely subjective and it really comes down to personal preference.
---
Yeah no, these changes definitely ran its course and had a negative impact on the game. If you disagree, BfA is waiting for you with flying and LFG.
---
True but it's enough for the tank to get aggro back.

---
Lol one the most idiotic comments I've ever seen in this sub or any other for that matter
---
The sentiment that “if you haven’t played vanilla, you’re bad” is pretty much dead.
---
In fact I’ve found that if you bring it up that you’re a vanilla player, most people don’t really give a damn. The game has evolved far beyond that point. Most people have no idea what vanilla was even like, let alone care.
---
Well I think your initial post is far too aggressive with this rule.  
---
"  Imagine a lvl 45 warrior, fully capable of wearing plate, rolling on Str/Agi leather gloves, when there's a rogue in the group.  "  
---
This example in particular irked me. If those gloves are a solid upgrade and you are a dps in the group there is no argument not to take them unless better gloves are easily available to you.  Str and Agi are great stats for a warrior.
---
Well if you bring a mage to a raid, that's adding 900-1200 or so DPS to the group. Bring a shadow and you're also adding a total of 900-1200 or so DPS to the group that the priest is responsible for, I don't think that's delusional lmao
---
Oh boy hop down off the cross their Jesus you can quit suffering whenever you like. Way to slip down that slow there. You can say whatever you want on plenty of places. I'm all for that. That's your right assuming you're American not sure how free speech works elsewhere. Go out in public and say whatever you like. The game has a ToS however and saying racist shit is against it. All it does is stir up shit and cause chat to be a shitshow. I know you think you're legitimately being "oppressed" because ToS will be enforced come classic but you can either deal with it or remain triggered. I've dealt with it on private servers for years and can safely say that unmoderated chat is pure cancer. There's plenty of places to go for that if that what you want.
---
For pve dps in t1 gear you will lack hit and crit gear and fall behind. 
---
For pvp t1 is okey but lacks crit
---
Logitech G600 is the only mouse you will ever need. Bought one for WoW 4 years ago and been using it ever since.
---
I do not recommend going warr if u have little time to play. It's the slowest leveler, it's extremely gear dependent in both pvp and pve and it takes a long time to get the entry gear (aka prebis) for raiding. You will also need to farm quite a bit of gold to get some boe/crafted stuff. No m8. Choose something else. I'd recommend warlock/mage. If you enjoy healing, go for pally or priest.
---
Shamans and Paladins on each faction, lmao
---
SENNNND ITTTTT
---
I've been considering this too since in MMOs I heal pretty much exclusively. Some things to consider:
---
1. Level in a DPS spec. You can still tank or heal 5-mans while leveling, just keep some appropriate gear on hand (bags or bank) to equip before you go to the instance. This works until late game, but might even work in end-game 5-mans if you gear and weak your spec a little.
---
2. At end-game, if you can't find a group to farm with and split the loot, consider leveling a farming alt. I'll probably roll a mage or something for this purpose so I don't have to respec.
---
3. As a healer you can still kill things, it just takes longer.
---
Hence why I'm going prot. Quick groups.
---
I get off on that shit.
---
Oh, is that the hybrid magic/physical damage build that's all about procs? I've gathered that can actually put out pretty respectable dps, but I'm shocked that crowd pummeler effect is good enough to outstrip the shitty weapon DPS for non-ruids
---
I started playing when I was 15 and I thought warlocks were so badass but I also wanted to be a melee character...so i ran around with a sword and a firestone and convinced myself I was a battle mage.   
---
I died a lot
---
Or use the herbalism passive too. Flowers will sprout from seemingly nowhere.
---
- qsr should not be hunter prio. its not replace in bwl. depending on what you run its not even replaced in aq40.
---
- rogues should have sameprio as wars on dft and master dragonslayer ring
---
- why is there no war prio on jom gabber
---
Well, i know that its pretty much unobtainable, but thunderfury has the best AoE threat generation for warriors ;)
---
It says roughly 30 seconds on Nefarian wiki. It is slightly less than 30 seconds on every single server I have played on.
---
You aren't clearing misconceptions, you are creating them.
---
I still don't understand why people say warriors are a slog to level.
---
Add to the list: Thunderfury is super strong for multimob tanking. 
---
Other thoughts: I was a main tank in vanilla. I was always praised for my ability to hold aggro on big packs. All of the things you listed are great and helpful. I didn't have any special AOE tanking set. Didn't have engineering. 
---
The key to multimob tanking is tab targeting. 
---
Enter the pack.  Thunderclap if possible. Demo Shout. 
---
First target ideally gets a shield slam. 
---
Tab. Sunder. Tab Sunder. Repeat. 
---
Apply sunder to every mob in the pile you can, rinse and repeat. 
---
Any mob that breaks free from the pile gets taunted back to you and SS.
---
In raids, there are very points where you will have to tank more than 2 or 3 mobs at once. Some of the packs in AQ are pretty big but it won't just be you doing all the work. You'll have lots of CC and other tanks.
---
Spoken like a true raider. Dont think what you can get out of a raid, think what YOU can do for the raid.
---
It’s only items that are considered BiS and multiple people roll on so things like perdition are only rolled on by rogues so not included
---
Literally all the data supports what I'm saying, none what you claim. Even on private servers where fury warriors are way better than in real vanilla due to bad coding, Rogues still dominate in melee DPS all the way until Naxxramas gear. This difference will be even greater in Classic, in fact it is very likely Warriors won't ever number 1 melee DPS in Classic due to this.
---
Also, reminder that the world first Naxxramas full clear guilds, such as Kungens guild, only had tank warriors, no DPS warriors. If it had been better than Rogues in vanilla, they would have used them.
---
&gt;  I'm talking about "fun", from the perspective of the large audience of people who preferred the game mechanics of the original game.
---
And you're still objectively incorrect. Plenty of people enjoy modern wow for what it is. Plenty of us will enjoy BOTH modern and classic.
---
What you mean to say is that cata killed the game for you personally.
---
&gt; Everyone (look at me, speaking for "everyone" again even though it's obviously just a generalization, so entitled) is running around with their hair on fire over how Diablo is dead.
---
At this point most people seem to understand that it's just a mobile game with the diablo IP. The only major problem was the boneheaded announcement.
---
&gt; Who says Diablo is dead? That's just an opinion? Obviously the fans of the original Diablo design philosophy.
---
I'M a fan of the original Diablo design philosophy. This is not my opinion.
---
Prot warriors are always in demand.
---
A factor of several hours isn’t shit to an average player. Not everyone needs to be world first at everything.
---
I managed to preserve one of the first twink videos that predates youtube, back when google video and warcraftmovies were "the shit." This video is partly responsible for getting me into playing rogue.

Sup, my name was Elzidane ( Dwarf Warrior) ! Guild was Wicked Demise/ Defiance

Thank-you!
---
I am personally torn between warlock and mage for Classic. I played warlock up until WoD for retail so I have a lot of time invested into that specific class but mages were always one of the "is the grass greener on the other side of the pasture" type deals.  
---
I'll try to break down the thoughts I've put into it regarding leveling, PvE and PvP of course.  
---
We'll start off with warlock;  
---
\+ Very fast and easy leveler thanks to pets.
---
\+ Very tanky for a clothie.
---
\+ Has healthstones and a self ressurrection should things go awry.
---
\+ Free mount and very easy to farm with thanks to Blueberry.  
---
\+ Limited availability for spell hit which means first phase will be a bit of a struggle in PvE.
---
\+ Can go either SM/Ruin or DS/Ruin, both of which are good for farming, PvP and PvE so you don't need to respec that much. SM/Ruin is slightly better for general use imo.
---
\+ Scales VERY well with gear and starts doing a LOT of damage.
---
\+ Never really runs OOM in fights so you always have something to do.
---
\- No real way of getting threat reduction or resets outside of 8/8 Nemesis or Limited Invulnurability Potions.
---
\- Some guilds may want you to farm shards beforehand to summon key members such as healers and tanks.
---
\- If you want to be completely optimal, you want to have some shards laying around to take advantage of Imp. Shadowbolt debuff with some spicy Shadowburns.
---
\- Gear competition with the mages.
---
\+ Has access to arguably the most fun PvP spec in the game with the Nightfall/Conflag build.
---
\+ Very tanky and has great capabilities to 1vX when you get comfortable with it.
---
\+ Has immense depth with pet micromanagement and even more against higher level enemies and engineering. (For example whenever you spot a shadow reflection trinket going up, throwing a Corruption makes sure you can't get hard reset by a poly if facing a mage and a Curse of Recklessness makes sure you can't get feared at all by warriors/priests/warlocks.)  
---
\+ Pet utilities are crazy good, being able to purge magic effects with felhunter or do a spicy seduction into Soul Fire for top memes.
---
\+ Absolutely nuts burst and damage output when you hit BWL+ gear. If the stars align then you easily have the highest burst in the game and can basically global a tank.
---
\- Mobility is what you trade for your tankiness, can be hard to get away from multiple melee.
---
\- Phase 1 as previously stated will be a bit iffy due to the lack of spellhit.
---
\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---
Mages;
---
\+ Fast to level if you know what to do and learn how to AoE farm.
---
\+ Free portals and food/water means that you are very self-sustaining and have a lot less travel time.
---
\+ Can sell portals/food/water for some extra money while leveling.
---
\+ Frost means that you have a lot of control while leveling along with a hard CC means that when played correctly you can deal with nearly any situation.
---
\- Mages are inherently pretty squishy in comparison to warlocks, so if you don't know how to play them yet, expect a few deaths while you're learning.
---
\+ Frost is the way to go for MC and BWL, so you don't have to respec much as Frost is good for farming, PvP and PvE.
---
\+ Fairly easy to get close to hit cap through Frost and the available gear.
---
\+ Robe of the Archmage is a brilliant piece of gear you can get very early if you level tailoring, will last you a long time.
---
\+ Guilds and random dungeom groups love mages, they bring food/water, hard CC and good DPS.
---
\+ Scale decently well with gear.
---
\+ You can go fire once you hit AQ40 so you throw a red ball instead of a blue ball for some nice breath of fresh air.
---
\- Having to make water for the raid can be a bit annoying.
---
\- Gear competition with the other mages and warlocks.  
---
\+ Arguably the highest skill ceiling in a class when it comes to PvP.
---
\+ Tying in with the point above, mages have probably the most complete toolkit when it comes to control and dealing with situations.
---
\+ FANTASTIC on demand burst damage and slows.
---
\+ Lots of instant casts and spell schools, very hard to lock down a mage if he's good.
---
\+ Only things you have to look out for are warlocks/spriests and hunters more or less.
---
\+ 2x Ice Block for great reset potential and "oh shit" buttons if you make mistakes.
---
\+ Lots of great PvP videos to draw inspiration from. (Vurtne, Greatwizard, Ohgee etc etc)
---
\+ A lot of depth thanks to multiple spell schools, tools for every occasion and engineering on top of it.
---
\+ Best fight controller in the game more or less.
---
\- As stated previously, a well played spriest or warlock will likely eat your ass whole, or it'll be a really rough fight. Same if a hunter gets the drop on you.
---
\- Having to respec to frost or elemental when you hit AQ40+ as you'll be raiding in fire.
---
I'm sure that there are most things I haven't really thought of or just forgotten for the time being so if someone has something to chime in with, feel free to do so.
---
These are just my observations based on trying to decide for myself if I want to go mage or warlock. I am still very undecided, which is a pain in the ass.
---
Warlocks because they summon me, but also mages because they portal me.
---
Lol what are you smoking?  You sjws are the ones that are triggered.  You are playing a game which is literally killing people based on race and conquering their land, but let's not call this axe the nicker, that sounds like that bad word.  What are you, in grade school?
---
Thanks for the laughs bro.  You've got one twisted way of thinking.
---
And btw America is no different from any other advanced country when it comes to pretty much any right as a citizen.
---
15 years later and that Night Elf is still the finest piece of ass on the internet.
---
The sever I played on was 30 seconds
---
Sincerely fuck you. I’m done talking to you about this. I wasn’t upset. Until you wanted to put me on trial with accusations like I’m lieing.
---
Warlocks on strike day 2
---
LOL
---
&gt; Healer may be a little harder, but honestly you generally as a healer pay attention to so much that you probably notice more things in a raid than a typical DPS (many whom don't even put raidframes up on screen)
---
This.  As a healer, assuming you have your raid frames customized appropriately, you will always know who isn't doing what they should be doing.
---
Speaking as raid leader: Delegation. Get officers to assist you in running the guild.
---
Hmm, you've fully convinced me that it's not worth it. Gold is so damn useful in classic, especially at first, but also always for consumables, and for alts which I plan on doing alot of. 
---
The price of the pattern and the mats is like half an epic mount. Eh.
---
In Vanilla, people were running MC for years.
---
you can do WHAT
---
Guess I just have shit luck.
---
Personally it would kinda piss me off if the raid leader decided he was the one dude who gets to be the shadow priest and told all the other priests they are SOL. It’s one thing for a raid lead to be the main tank.. that’s probably the most demanding raid spot and you GOTTA have one.
---
But yeah no matter how carefully the raid lead shadow priest distributes loot, any time he takes a dps piece that usually would go to a mage or warlock, deserved or not, is probably going to make a lot of salty mages and warlocks.
---
The server you played on was 45 seconds three posts ago. Which is it? Do you remember, or are you making shit up?
---
Yeah, it goes both ways depending on the boss.  I would say Warriors would be the superior choice for *most* fights, but that isn't to say Druids are a *bad* choice, just not the *ideal* choice in a perfect world.  An amazing player playing a Druid is still going to be better than a garbage player on a Warrior.
---
That said, a Druid MT is perfectly fine, but your guild/raid leader/Druid tank need to understand when and why they are *not* the appropriate choice for MT on a given fight.  Arguably, having a dedicated Druid MT or OT is wonderful, because the gear they want pre-BWL is [dungeon blues, with only 3 items that a Warrior tank would want from MC](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/#moltencorebis).  It really helps get your 2 primary tanks geared up faster, and the trend continues throughout your progression.
---
People are gonna rag on Druids here, in game once Classic drops, wherever, but fuck 'em, this shit has been mathed out, played out, and proven for over a decade now.
---
This is actually awesome advice.
---
Band of Band of Accuria goes to the main tank first. Aged core leather gloves goes to the tank first.
---
Crafted 1h mace with chain lightning effect: https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12794/masterwork-stormhammer
---
Thats why DKP is so good. You can roll on any item regardless of spec, at the cost of your progression. Losing progression on your main spec performance can make you lose your raid spot.
---
Nobody fucks up on dkp raids
---
Isnt that the definition of a skill cap? 😀
---
I've formed multiple Vanilla guilds and medium sized Eve Online corporation (100+ members).  Here are my 2c.  Most of them have to do with dealing with people, not the game.
---
* Understand you'll be playing the Guild Leader game a lot more than World of Warcraft.
---
* Make the guild you'd want to join.  Take that vision and run with it.  Every guild has different flavors.
---
* Always, always, always be recruiting.  Yes, even if you have a ton of members.  Attrition is a silent killer.
---
* Be weary of accepting groups of friends or guild mergers.  Or, at least know that they can leave just as quick as they joined.
---
* There is absolutely positively nothing wrong with being an 'average' or 'below average' guild.
---
* Understand that the 3 biggest reasons for guild implosions are loot drama, bad/unfair leadership, and PvE roadblocks.  
---
   * Loot drama and bad leadership are human-made constructs, PvE roadblocks are not.  
---
   * Therefore, with good policies and leadership you can prevent 2 of the 3 biggest reasons for guild implosions.  That is your main task as a Guild Leader: build the guild and minimize implosion risk.
---
* Strong leadership (enforcing reasonable rules) will get you a more loyal following than 'nice' leadership (bending over backwards to appease certain members).
---
* It's a myth you need to be amazing at the actual game to be a good Guild Leader.  WoW is easy, managing people is not.  There's a reason why WoW never had 40-man raids after Vanilla.
---
   * However.... the better and more knowledgeable you are about the game the better credibility you have.
---
* Don't get upset/mad when people inevitably leave or get poached.  Like a breakup, it's best just move on and spend your energy elsewhere.
---
* If you feel comfortable enough with confrontation, actively encourage back-seat guild leaders to leave and take their 'supporters' with them.  This is half bluff and half potentially culling toxic members.  
---
   * If you're leading your guild right, the back-seat guild leaders will realize they actually don't have nearly as much influence as they think.
---
   * If you aren't leading it right, you may get a mass exodus which means your leadership wasn't very good and guild might actually deserve to die.
---
* Lots of people have ideas, but very few people are willing to work to actually implement those ideas.  It's an easy way to deflect suggestions you think are superfluous.
---
* Don't underestimate the difficulty in managing 40+ people.  Leading 20, 25, and 30-man raiding guilds are wildly different than leading 40-man raiding guilds.  Again: there's a reason why WoW never had 40-man raids after Vanilla.
---
* Real leaders don't need titles/roles to distinguish themselves.  Remember this when people are wanting roles/titles to be made, created, and given out.
---
* It's inevitable that you're going to burn out eventually or want to take a break.  
---
   * Try to build a guild that can live on without you ...... but would prefer to exist with you.
---
* The 2nd most important position (perhaps even most important person) for a guild is Raid Leader.  
---
   * Do your best to get a good raider leader and minimize the bullshit they have to deal with (i.e. the barrier to entry on getting a raiding core, personal drama, etc.) and immediately neutralize armchair raid leaders.
---
   * You won't find many veteran raid leaders who would mind leading even newbies. Raid leaders typically like the challenge and like teaching.
---
healing droods are bad in pvp. Especially in bg. you dont have swiftmend in classic, your hot gets dispelled and take too long to to heal a player to be effective in pvp. Healing touch has a long cast. you have shit armor while in human form (and you cant heal in bear form). Druids are good flag carriers in warsong gulch. And moderately fun in solo world pvp. That's pretty much it.
---
Pick a warrior. Many beta testers stated that XP/h in dungeons is waaaay better than it was on private servers. Thus, grab a shield, and whenever you hit a viable lvl for another instance go and do it once or twice untill you upgrade your gear significantly (usually new weapon is enough). This way you should lvl in a good pace, you should make a lots of friends if you’re a positive buddy. Friends for warriors are crucial. You dont’t wanna play warrior alone. A single warrior is a huge turtle, everyone can run around and put a finger at you. A warrior with only a healer is a god damn force to be recon with. And ofc the more friends you make on your way to 60, the easier you’ll find a good guild to stick with
---
I play my class because I’ve played it for well over a decade. I was told to play this class by an IRL friend because their raiding guild needed one. I’ve raided hardcore for years, put up rank 1 world parses on retail MoP with it and gotten glad level
---
idk, who cares I guess. I’ve played all classes at a high level except new demon hunter. wow classes aren’t much fun compared to other mmo’s design, it’s everything else that makes wow enjoyable. It’s more difficult for me to list classes I find tolerable than ones I like, especially under Vanilla design as compared with say tbc. Kind of a depressing answer, big F lmao
---
\**Cries in Night Elf**
---
First character was a rogue. When I finally got around to playing lock and paladin, I didnt know you had to add new ranks to your spell bar until like, past level 20. :(
---
People should be discouraged from making low quality posts.  I fully support mods who gas everything that doesn't meet the standard.
---
Just give me bone reaver's edge and I'm happy.
---
Yeah that's a good shield but I will probably choose the sword reward over the shield because it looks like a lightsaber lol.
---
Its not even useless Rogue loot, its literally leather offpieces that Rogues don't even want.  A dedicated Feral tank is an excellent gear soak, even for Resto gear once the 1-3 Restos you bother bringing have their tier sets.
---
Counterpoint: the upvote/downvote system should take care of simple questions people don’t want to answer. If it doesn’t, some people might be actually getting useful info from the posts whether or not us people here multiple times a day do or not.
---
You’re giving me such a hardon. I can’t wait to break a sweat pumping out 2k dps. Cramps all over my body just to beat the second lowest dpser
---

---
It’s time dedication you fucking retard, no one wants to waste theirs.
---
Maybe you do, and everyone will be able to spot it from a mile away.
---
Better than /r/travel where they told me this has been asked before, so I deleted my post, and they banned me from the sub
---
This is why class leaders are nice to have.
---
Warriors are like *the* single best DPS in vanilla, though
---
Then I must consider this an act of treason.
---
This is a good rundown. Sapper charges are useful too
---
Even before they added the harbor Stormwind was still susceptible to air raids from zeppelins or wyvern riders. Ironforge is god tier. You would have to conquer Stormwind first and shut down the tram before you could lay siege to Ironforge.
---
Thought the number next to my shadowbolt on my warlock was the amount of bolts I had. Didnt want to waste the only 1 or 2 I had so I meleed until I was low on health and then I released the shadowbolt! And understood that it was my keybind, not amount...
---
Man these new flairs we have are great. Too bad I have not a single clue what I'm gonna play so I can't update mine.
---
Yeah, I'm still not sure if WotLK went too far with merging spell haste and melee haste into a single stat like that too, but either way I'm looking forward to the new heights of hybrid stuff in future versions of Classic!
---
Is this video just suggesting you use software to spam keys for you? That’s banable and people have been banned for it.
---
Know what you are about, and don't false advertise.
---
Get fucked. Thats what.
---
Treason? Have you lost your mind, u/rower1337 ?
---
Pretty much. Get used to tab sundering. Then you can look at sunder stacks to gauge your threat! Ah good times.
---
Yes, and queue up Cleave instead of Heroic Strike (rage permitting)
---
I'm confused. A post by a moderator and I feel something other than hatred and contempt.
---
Is this really Reddit or have I somehow wandered back into a parallel dimension where Facebook was stillborn, Twitter is just something that birds do and people moderate web forums because they enjoy being part of a community of fans?
---
Face smashing the keyboard is the best part of the game
---
TY! Fixed, I did the healing stuff last so I was a little brain dead.
---
You won't be cornered into healing, you just won't get as many groups.
---
If you’re guildless there’s no better way to find a guild than dazzling them that way.
---
Life tap too. Important to know when to place those in your rotation
---
You’re really out of the loop huh
---
I can't wait to be invited to every five man to tank as a warrior.
---
keep in mind that almost everyone on horde will be undead, warrior, or shaman. Which means that your "fear" skill will be garbage compared to a horde warlock. Which sucks:(
---
160 all school resis unbuffed for pets if you go soul link, its crazy.
---
I've actually been looking for a new mouse with 12+ buttons on it. Thanks alot for the info - I'll definetly look into the perdition.  :)
---
Ok so you're fine with it. That's great, but what if because of some of the things people are saying it starts driving customers away because they don't want to be around that kind of attitude. What if businesses stop working with you or suppliers stop supporting you because they don't agree with how you do business? I bet you'd start caring then once it affected you monitarly. That's the position Blizzard is in. Once again WoW and video games tend to be escapes from every day life. Most normal people AKA the vast majority of your customers don't want to come to your game or even business and hear about how Trump did this or "insert race here" is bad blah blah blah or my political team is better than yours. You can be subjected that crap for free. Who the hell wants to pay good money and have to deal with that?
---
Threat
---
Eh rogues get a pretty badass series of quest swords and other good blues like triprunner dungarees.
---
Warlock is definitely way fucking harder than mage.. I'd argue for lock rather than hunter just because it's a more meaningful comparison to mages.
---
Pretty sure most mage players have some kind of weird complex about the class.
---
Does shout spam work in classic?  Wasn’t Demo shout divided threat?  so it was kinda shitty for threat purposes after only a handful of targets right?  Maybe I’m misremembering 
---
Also battle shout iirc only applied threat if the buff was not already on your party. I don’t think it anything if party members had the buff already. Again - I could be very mistaken lol
---
Stealth, being able to sneak past annoying trash mobs or sneak up on Alliance players while they are distracted.
---
Hence the meme
---
Idk how it’ll work in classic, but the ingame time should match the local time in 24hr format
---
I’m afraid that’s just you.
---
Unfortunately there is no hybrids for dummies.  I think all hybrids cam be viable as non healers in some capacity but they need a strong understanding of the class and each individual fight/raid to reach their max potential.  
---
When optimal for 1 fight is tanking and optimal for another is spamming decurse you really need to be coordinating with your raid leader.
---
Oof I was hoping on health
---
I think blizzard bans people for automated rotation software that spams a rotation. All this does is spam a key when it's pushed.
---
Was wondering about the external install. I have a laptop, was wondering about using work laptop for wow to avoid lugging two laptops if i were to fly. Maybe there will be a post in the future about an external install
---
Uhh no. The Classic beta was very laggy compared to private servers.
---
I raided as shadow in vanilla.  Carry a healing set on you and be prepared to swap over to it and offheal depending on the fight.  You have no AOE options at all, whatsoever.  You'll do good dps on extended single target fights, but any sort of fast target switching or AOE encounter you don't provide any help to the raid.   Better off spot healing.   For BWL, you are useless as a SPriest on Vael.  Down Razorgore, switch your Anathema staff to Benediction mode, and play offheal for the next hour
---
One time I got into an argument about how often people misspelled "rogue".  She said that it was just a typo, but I argued "how come no other class gets that typo as often".
---
So shortly after we are forming a group and someone goes "we need a rouge".  
---
I reply "a what now?"
---
"a rouge"
---
"what class?"
---
"rouge"
---
My friend goes "I GET IT!".  Didn't have to argue about that anymore.
---
Why does that item even exist
---
I'll be playing shaman. Shaman are great because they can easily turn the tide of group fights while leveling, they're always necessary for raids (and usually underplayed) so getting a spot is easy. Plus, as someone who has traditionally played melee in WoW, they're ranged, which is a fucking godsend because I'm not being kited like a regard all day.
---
Also, I can eventually heal while being specced elemental, which is wonderful.
---
Wasn’t there a clock on the mini map? Is that what you’re talking about
---
BiS gets pretty situational for tanks, based on what you're fighting and how much you are prioritizing toughness vs threat generation.
---
I used to carry 4 trinkets and ~6 pieces of alternate tanking gear, plus resistance gear if needed. Drake Fang Talisman was the trinket used most often, though.
---
Actually never mained a priest before but I love healing (played all other healing classes before) and want to do the real healer deal. Even though I'm only 90% sure and might switch to druid for the flexibility of being *everything.* :D
---
&gt; people love to give names to things in wow to feel like they are skilled or something
---
I will invite you to my next party.
---
But I will send you the wrong address to make sure you do not actually show up.
---
You posted this twice
---
I was an orc warrior all of vanilla. This time I want to try something different so I'll be an alliance rogue I think. Its all about new experiences and I've done warrior too much.
---
Your words made feel confortable about leveling a feral druid now.
---
Thank you.
---
Rogues have the most tools that they can only apply to one target at a time and there's usually a rather binary decision making process to which you use in what situation when you boil it down.
---
Most of what rogue is is just deciding on who to jump on and when (like in multi PvP, obviously 1v1s are super binary for rogues) because it's not TBC/WotLK and you don't have your super good player mistake eliminators and the class is actually quite vulnerable (referring to cloak/recuperate/cheat death).
---
That's my philosophy at least and I hope to be able to raid with like minded individuals. Too me it's like any other team sport, you need to be thinking about how your *team* achieves not what *you* achieve or wether you have fun or not.
---
I dumped my wife and put an ad up for a girl that wants to play wow and have meth babies with me.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQIVkp-ruY4
---
Eh, it's not as bad as stun resist on Orcs, WotF is on a cool down and we have 3 fears, so it's not so bad.
---
Don't start a guild by yourself get a few friends who are active most of the time people will leave if they see little to no activity making it hard to retain guild members. For raiding build a large roster of people you know or know of and make sure they are on the same page on how you feel about things within the guild. Best of luck
---
You cannot do decent DPS in tank-centric gear. In fact, even if you have great DPS gear on but you are protection specced, you still wouldn't do any good damage. If you go protection spec you can't really do anything but tank. 
---
However a DPS specced warrior in good tanking gear *can* still do a decent job tanking, with good support and healing behind you.
---
Take with a grain of salt though as this is my anecdotal vanilla experience as someone who mained a warrior in vanilla (I raided all vanilla content and but beat C'thun and only got 3-4 bosses into Naxx).
---
For a group of three, at what level should this dungeon be attempted?
---
I plan to average a couple hours a night leveling, then a bunch of time on the weekends.  I'm not rushing it though just going to play at my pace.
---
Is this a poor attempt at a troll?
---
You spam rank 1 wingclip just like a warrior would hamstring.
---
You do you, buddy.
---
I love warlocks
---
Yes just like any rotation of any class that presses more then 1 button, you press the other button every x seconds... fking sperg.
---
isn't there a spec 0/30/21 that does both pvp and pve?
---
Hotw wants a word with u guys:)
---
There's no way in hell you can do cat dps without power shifting. But you should be able to macro it so you can basically just spam a "shred" buttom without thinking much. Str is the highest prio for dps, agi is at least as good for leveling bc of the defensive stats. But they are both very good for both. It's like a 10% difference between str and agi in terms of dps
---
I didnt say I like LFG, actually if you kept scrolling you would read I said it is what killed socialization in wow. And I wasn't asking for either of these things in classic. So learn to read. The quote you took from my post is 100% fact.
---
I imagine though, that there is a point where your throughput is high enough and you want to start increasing raid damage. Before you have solid +healing gear, I could see the case for holy. But there is a point where you can heal through incoming damage, and your limiting factor is time. For that reason, PI becomes important to burn bosses down. You could probably argue about what gear level that happens. Maybe it is Naxx. I'd be curious to hear the input of someone who has done these fights recently.
---
Yea it’s the shape/aesthetic of that one I’m not digging yet from pictures at least. I am a fan of Logitech mouses though. My first gaming mouse that lasted me like 10 years was the old MX518. That thing was way ahead of its time. The shape and design of this G600 though is looking weird/uncomfortable. Definitely going to check it out though. Ik they have them on display at a store near me so I’m gonna go feel up all of them before I decide on one.
---
&lt;Unlucky&gt;**[NA][H][PVP][Casually Hardcore]**
---
**Timezone:**EST
---
**Raid Times:**Tuesday 8pm-11:59pm until phase 5 or when a second raid day is needed (vanilla is easy) Wednesday 8pm-11:59pm
---
**Server Location:**Chicago
---
**Loot Method:**We will use a 5 person loot council; 3 are static officers with an additional 2 rotating raiders weekly for transparency and so people have a voice and are involved.
---
**About &lt;Unlucky&gt;:**We aim to enjoy vanilla wow in a casual hardcore way, a chunk of our core comes from pservers and dislike the sweaty egotistical scene. Vanilla is a 15 year old puzzle thats been solved and we feel that if you want to play some meme specs, then you should be able to. We expect our raiders to show up consumed/enchanted/geared and push their buttons in the right order, but won't be enforcing or kicking people out of the guild for making mistakes or missing a raid because real life.

Warrior charge/intercept I love how buggy it is. Enemy is up on a cliff? Charge.
---
Interesting, definitely gonna check this out after work.
---
That's my plan. Going to enjoy the leveling experience. When I was younger though all I wanted to do was rush to max lvl.
---
What happened to make you so toxic? Your profile is littered with bigotry and anger. You made a comment that you're wife's son does your finances so I can only assume you are a full grown adult. I pity anybody who has to interact with you on a consistent basis. I hope your life turns around and you realize how shitty you behave.
---
If 12 days was the average on a hardcore pserver of long time fans that have done it multiple times, why do you think op will spend 8-10 days as a first timer? Id rather guess something like 15 days tbh.
---
Cruiser time *feels* less rewarding, to you.
---
That's not the problem of anybody else, or Blizzard.
---
Go with priest or mage and whatever race you feel like represents your character best.  Both cloth classes have pretty solid leveling qualities and are generally looked as great group mates for dungeons.  You might have an easier time farming as mage, but priest would probably be better in group pvp.
---
It will cost a lot less if you hit 60 pretty soon after launch. 
---
When people have multiple characters, low level mats sell for inflated prices to the many 60s on the server. When the server is fresh, low levels need their mount money and will sell mats for reasonable prices.
---
So the answer really is maybe. Both shadow priests and boomies are really bad in end game pve, so you'll have to make up for it in someway. 
---
First, be social, people tend to recruit from their friends, so if you run 5mans and pvp with people you have a chance to get a guild invite, nobody is just inviting some random boomie. 
---
Second, find a guild full of passionate pvpers and be one yourself. Giving you loot is a waste for pure pve progression, but if your guild likes to run BGs together then they'll benefit from your upgrades in that environment. 
---
Embrace your hybrid role. If the healers want help decursing or dispelling, you're the guy. Don't cry about how it hurts your sad pathetic dps, volunteer to be the utility player who takes pressure off the dedicated healers.
---
Most importantly, don't walk around with a chip on your shoulder telling people they just don't understand how good boomies are, you'll come across as an idiot. Emphasize that you like the role overall, do the best you can with it, and be understanding of guilds who aren't really sure if they have a spot for you on their roster. If you present yourself as a knowledgeable mature player who understands the realities of the game and is knowingly doing something different, people will be more willing to give you a chance.
---
gif mooooooooooore
---
You wouldn't be here if private servers were not utter shit. You want something better just like everyone else.
---
All these people whooshing all over this fine sarcasm...
---
I would probably cap it at level 14 or 15 to consider it a legit run. level 16 brings in new abilities from every single class which make it so much more advantageous than groups attempting this at 14 or 15. That's how I'll try to "balance" each dungeon to keep it competitive but also not exploitable.  
---
But if a group of 3 level 12's completed it naked, it would be an achievement on its own and I would recognize that on its own! I plan on creating a 2nd youtube highlight reel channel for this to give it exposure and an incentive for others to participate in
---
&gt;buildists
---
I like buildgots too.
---
Bought a mechanical keyboard and have to play lots before the release to get my gf used to the sound before the real button smashing begins :D
---
Well it's wrong. It's not "two or a few" because few is the word for 3+. Couple very literally means a pair, in other words, two of something.
---
That dictionary is wrong.
---
It isn't though.  I lvled a worgen from 1 to 10 just a few days ago and I lagged, my friend across the states I was lvling with was lagging, and everyone I asked that replied in general was lagging (3 people)
---
Try the 10 day trial and see.
---
It ran at 60fps for me on an older MacBook Air
---
Given many have yo compete with hunters for good stat stick melee weapons, I would say it is fair
---
That's what I plan to do also. Not sure I would have fun trying to rush it.
---
Rp-PvE baby. The sub has a strong pvp emphasis, but of course vast amounts players on Live have historically been on either PVE, or _PVP-with-90%-of-1-faction_ servers. 
---
I'd like to make an alt on a popular pvp server with some streamer-led events however.
---
RP-PVE I think is the ideal "immersed MMO where you can find players all over the place just doing _stuff_" experience. Even on a PVE server, you're much less likely to find random 60s hanging around zones or even being offline if they aren't farming, dungeoning, raiding, etc.
---
Already did PVP-Pserver stuff aplenty, and god was it a toxic waste dump. I also play on pservers for actual PVP MMOs like Warhammer so I don't feel like I'm missing much.
---
That’s a great reply, thanks for your time!!
---
Apart from what others have said already The Cannon from stratholme. The head from gnomeregan (the range of that thing is ridiculous, I pulled what seemed like half of strat live once with it).
---
That's the thing man, my girlfriend just started playing and I get so annoyed when she asks me random stuff (which talents to pick). It's just, she trusts my opinion and I can give her a really direct answer because of how long I've been playing.
---
I used to play a ton of pick up ball right? My buddy who has been playing since he was 7 gave me tips and I ran with them and they helped right? Some dude who started playing with us about two years later and just started playing tried giving me tips and I just ignore him. It's all about the experience and direct answers you can get.
---
Only if you’re a paladin.
---
Right, I've seen some people with spreadsheets on how/where/when they will be X level, that would give me an ulcer lol.
---
Talent inspect happened at some point in TBC
---
You basically have to lower your expectations, yesterday there was a guy who was flamed for posting about wanting to dump 40+ hours a week but just had a new born baby.  The amount of divorce jokes in that thread was hilarious.
---
That's probably a good idea, maybe I should do the same for my wife!
---
Lol I don’t like that aesthetic trend either. Logitech G402 is a nice and lightweight, simple looking. Or I like the steelseries rival series I used before I tried switching in the last year. simple and leightweight.
---
How do Warlocks handle on horde side for raids? Seems like threat would be a nightmare without Salvation.
---
I plan on playing hunter and agree on Band of Accuria. Its only an upgrade for hunter if they need it for the 2% to hit, which is only really the case if they already have every other item that's bis already.
---
No, they don't in vanilla/Classic as far as we know, just on private servers due to the inaccurate crit chances etc.
---
Private server logs are 100% irrelevant in this topic, because they all have bad coding that makes it vastly, vastly different from real vanilla/Classic. We know for a fact Fury Warriors are a lot worse in Classic, they have inflated crit chances on privas.
---
Not in vanilla.
---
Yeah not sure how that could be fun to anybody lol. Part of the fun should be leveling and getting to know your class!
---
Hunters use ring set from ZG
---
Actually I would still prefer private servers from a developing standpoint:
---
\- content is often slightly overtuned, 
---
\- items change from patch 1.0 to 1.12 (like Savage Gladiator Chain, Deathbone set etc.)
---
\- PvP gear is implemented from the start, however the old stats and it gets updated in patch 1.8.
---
\- the old 1.4 unarmored epic mounts are in the game for half a year before getting removed
---
So from a gameplay perspective the current pservers are superior to classic.
---
However the elephant in the room remains the instability and uncertainty.
---
Devs and GMs can go rogue from day to the other and the server closes down overnight. This is the one and only reason why I'm switching.
---
Are nether crystal and illusion dust in the wrong spots on the spreadsheet?
---
Then he counters with invisibility cloak, and back and forth it goes!
---
Yes, you have to slowly get them ladies used to the noice since its gonna be lots of it.
---
Fiery blaze does no damage. If crusader's heal does healing threat then that hand down better. Someone should test that.
---
The druid 30/0/21 and 0/30/21 specs are standard raid healing specs, both with 30 points in dps talents, making them perfectly fine solo.
---
The shaman 30/0/21 spec is also perfectly fine solo, with 30 points in elemental, while being a healing spec meant for 5/10/20 mans.
---
But 40 man raids want shaman with mana tide or windfury totems, and that requires either 22 in enhancement or 31 in resto, and either spec will suck for solo. The 31 resto because no dps talents, and the 22+ enhancement because all your raid gear is healing (MC/BWL) or caster (ZG/AQ/PvP) orientated.
---
Make friends with fellow crafters. Trade enchants for food, flasks, sharpening stones, etc.
---
That's a long winded way to say "yes you're right, I can't wait for Classic to come out so I can stop playing on a shit private server"
---
Any news on why they changed dates? I recall watching the wow classic test would be on for another run in July, upon looking today said TBD...
---
So I had to check, and they have postponed abit and now it's TBD, Why?

I will have an our or two a week at best. I'll very slowly level up and reach 60 probably not before mid of 2020.
---
I'll visit old places, do some old quests, play some old dungeons.
---
Not for all the rice in china I would even consider actively raiding.
---
Does that rebuff stack with the warlocks shadow buff?
---
Is there a link to that thread? Would love to read it! Yeah I have a new born at home so that's the limiting factor for me.
---
I’m mostly sold on Tauren shaman as elemental burst in pvp with an aoe stun  will satisfy my desires endlessly. 
---
Waiting for someone to change my mind and convince me how much funner warlocks are.
---
I’ve compared the pvp videos and the lightning burst looks way more fun.
---
29/11/11 begs to differ
---
40 competent people
---
The game isn't so hard that you need to min max unless you are going for world firsts.
---
You level a little faster as a nelf because of wisp form (yes, you will be dying, don't try to pretend otherwise). Levelling in classic is no joke, and even though raiding is the endgame, getting there quicker is a legitimate advantage that shouldn't be overlooked.
---
Awesome, thanks! Yes those look much better.
---
In your case "you do you" means keep harping on Classic even though you are flocking to it.
---
I plan to play every night after my son and wife go to sleep. My wife goes to sleep pretty early normally (especially now being pregnant again). So I’d say I’ll play nightly from 8:30/9:00-12:00. Weekends will be the same as weekdays but maybe a tad later. 
---
I wake up early too either to be with my son while my wife sleeps or for work. 
---
I have a very busy life, I just plan to “prioritize” my evenings to WoW when I’m not with family. Should play around 25 hours a week on average.
---
Except the build doesnt work on live because SoR doesn't proc oil and chili like it does on pservers:(
---
Leveled up from 1 to 60 as Holy spec paladin, because my friend said paladins were the best healers in the game.
---
 Three or four months after I started playing he didn’t understand why I wasn’t 60 yet.
---
Shadowmeld out of combat into charge? It’s op!
---
So you forgo Nature's Swiftness so you can drop like 700 mana or whatever it for the bear charge? As a spec that's still primarily caster-based damage? Meaning either you have to drop 700+ mana for bear form multiple times for your multiple utility skills OR use them both in the same shift, which why would you because you can't really do damage as a bear with just 11 points in feral, so you still have to swap out to capitalize on the CC otherwise you're basically just wasting both of them.
---
iono about that one meng
---
Pat.. Swifty.. That warlock whom Im having a brainfart remembering.
---
Dumb question I'm sure, but when people keep saying "choose vanilla graphics" does that mean we'll have a choice to have the updated character models in wow classic?
---
I'm playing undead specifically because I loved chugging noggenfogger elixirs. The casting animation is so cool.
---
Yea, and playing with programmable MMO mouses is one of these exceptions.
---
What you think is shit is a good thing for other people and vice versa, so in this situation its something you dislike, but in another it can be something you used to love being changed cause other people have different opinions. 
---
I like the idea of debuff limit, makes the game more strategical.
---
A subjective opinion can't be 100% fact, lmao
---
Hot take: 1 Tauren druid, 1 orc warlock, 1 orc warrior, 1 troll mage and 2 troll rogues??
---
&gt; You're claiming the game is dead because you aren't having fun. That's an objective statement that is not true.
---
Literally the words I used were:
---
"I'm talking about "fun", from the perspective of the large audience of people who preferred the game mechanics of the original game."
---
You are literally refusing to acknowledge that there is anyone who preferred Vanilla over modern WoW.  You interpret all my opinions as statements of fact.  I point out Asmongold's opinion and you say 1) he's an ass 2) he doesn't represent literally everyone.  Both of these points have nothing to do with what I was saying.
---
I don't think you and I are capable of effectively communicated to each other.
---
Yeah but your guild has to sacrifice two debuff slots for you.
---
My favorite would be the shadow priest. It is what I played on retail as my off-spec (mained disc for the longest time). I like how they just melt everyone in 1v1 and can tank quite a bit with shadowform + inner fire. The thought of shadow priest can give many players nightmares alone. Fuck warlocks, they need a pet to help them, but chad shadow priest can truly solo people down.
---
I feel so blessing for owning a company that basicly runs it self. The time the you have spare " 1-2 hours a night and 4h on weekends" is basicly the hours i work.
---
"You think you do, but you don't."
---
Nice video!  Hopefully it helps quiet all the doom and gloomers around here completely fixated on this mechanic.
---
people are actually suggesting in this thread that blizzard will ban people using logietch gaming software? what are u stoners talking about lmao
---
Did someone say \[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker\]?
---
So calling someone a manbaby makes you one? Just look up "Sodapoppin gets warglaive" to see why people don't want to play with them.
---
Yeah I’ve come to realize this truth. With every third person talking about how they can sleep walk through all the content. I wish I could see their faces when they wipe in deadmines lol
---
PvP as a druid is going be be massively gear dependent compared to others. Also, natural shapeshifter, we aren't talking about 700 Mana swaps.
---
Feral charge is insane because it's an instant root, spell interrupt, and can chain into a heal, a bash, an entangle, or a Starfire.
---
&gt; but I'm shocked that crowd pummeler effect is good enough to outstrip the shitty weapon DPS for non-ruids
---
Stacking spellpower, it's all about Seal of Righteousness! SoR should do about 65 base damage per hit, improved to 75, then tack on 12.5% of (500ish) spellpower - the seal alone is doing ~140 base damage per hit, and ends up being 200 or so dps in prebis.
---
It's all about going fast.
---
Warcraftmovies?
---
Hardcore progression guilds are going to run a holy/shadow or disc/shadow healer, but many more casual guilds will take a 1-of shadow priest. You'll have better luck horde side since warlock is more popular there. If your raid only runs 2 locks, SP is pretty suspect, you want at least 4 locks in the raid to make the SP worthwhile.
---
For a vast majority of guilds that raid there will be about 3-5 tanks, 7-10 healers, and the rest DPS. Classes and specs do not really matter. The raid size is big enough that all needed roles will be filled. Late-Naxx is a different story, but we’re talking the average guild that will comprise a significant majority of the player base.
---
thats exactly what a mace warrior is.
---
I think you misunderstand.
---
I am not trying to minmax.  I am more than willing to take any warm body I can to fill the raid.  However if it turns out that we only have two tanks and 4 healers, well that's a problem.
---
Something like:
---
1 MT
---
4 OT
---
9 Healers
---
12 Melee
---
14 Ranged
---
Is what I'm looking for.  I just want a ballpark idea to work with so I know what to look for and if I need to ask anyone to respec.
---
I ran the beta on a 2013 macbook air without any problems. I ran the graphics on low and get 25-30 fps stable.
---
&gt; The game isn't so hard that you need to min max unless you are going for world firsts.
---
so this sub became copy pasta circlejerk already? i swaer i read this very same text in every other thread.
---
Super relevant, considering I’d give up ruling a bunch of whiny bitches as well
---
I would love to play when my son and wife go to sleep, but by the time they are asleep I am ready for bed myself. Weekends are the only days I am going to have 4+ hours a day to play.
---
Ofc, logitech Chain Macros that could completely castsequence my Rotation Up till wotlk we're allowed aswell right? :3
---
I thought it was pretty good. I know lots of people who wanted classic in my friends group who were on private servers. So I find it weird they complained since it was on private servers too. So I thought it was pretty interesting.
---
It won't. If you notice the release patterns as well. 8.2 just dropped. When classic drops 8.2 will be kind of dry for most. Then before phase 2, they will likely drop 8.3. then phase 2 then pre patch then phase 3 then 9.0 etc. People will go back and forth in-between content droughts
---
I'm a huge fan of transmog in current WoW but it does not have a place in classic, the feeling when you're in Orgrimmar wearing your shiny epics and seeing another player move next to you and you won't even have to click on them to know that they're inspecting you, it's the little things.
---
You say that if one person is moving the range is increased, and if the other is ALSO moving, the range is further increased.
---
As it pertains to melee leeway this is untrue. As an example if I frost nova a warrior he will never get any extra range so long as he is rooted and stationary- even if I'm moving.
---
Both players need to be moving for melee leeway to kick in.
---
Being offended isn't anything new. 24/7 news channels are relatively new however and they have to fill the content with something so what you're seeing and complaining about is getting more air time than it may have had in times past. Most people are just living their lives. You're also making a mountain out of a mole hill here. It's one item which had its name changed a long time ago for good reason. Because people can't behave and was causing a negative experience in game. It's not the items fault its the players. In a perfect world it wouldn't be an issue. If you're right however then sure Blizzard will see people vote with their wallet and abandon classic but I highly doubt that this particular change is the hill that anyone including YOU personally will die on. Also I highly doubt people being more sensitive to others (within reason of course) is somehow "crazy" and "detrimental" to society but that's a topic for another discussion.
---
No one's gonna get banned for basically having the power button on their mouse.
---
You are a very lucky person! I am sure it wasn't easy starting the company though.
---
if this is purely for horde a lot of the warrior stuff should be changed
---
15 years of memes and preconceived notions will do that to a community.
---
I didn't actually seriously start playing rogue until BFA, but I've always had a fascination with them since wrath. I've always had a rogue alt, though, so I'm excited to main one in classic. 
---
If I remember correctly I actually played one pretty regularly in cata, but it never saw high-end raiding.
---
I think if you want to roll need on what are obviously controversial items, such as Hand of Justice in BRD when there are rogues or DPS warriors in the group, then you should mention it before hand.
---
Don't be a dickhead and get to the end, having listened to your rogue and warrior talk about HoJ the entire Emp Run, only to need it out from under both of them. It's a sure fire way to get yourself hated, BiS or not.
---
It does but they mean that the rogue can just CC them and take it from them.
---
Places you took me: there.
---
It’ll take 6-12 months to answer this question, because no one knows what Classic will look like population-wise until then.
---
The warlocks appreciated me at least.  I got to honorarily participate in warlock chat &lt;3
---
Also we were a late-start guild (we were laerning zg/mc while others had all of bwl on farm) and managed to clear up to Twin Emps in AQ and like half of Naxx, so it didn't hurt too badly to lose 2 debuff slots for me to do my thing.
---
&gt;Hello.
---
We’re hard at work preparing for the launch of WoW Classic, and we’ve reached the conclusion that we’re not quite yet ready to do our Global Stress Test (previously scheduled for next week). While we’re still on track to launch WoW Classic on August 27, we need a bit more time before this final pre-launch worldwide test.
---
We’ll have a more definite date Soon™ and we’ll post it here as soon as we do. Thanks for your patience!
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-stress-test-date/227573
---
It won't stop at this change is what I'm saying, and eventually people will vote with their wallets when it gets bad enough.
---
But who tested otherwise then?
---
This isn't specific to this thread, but the "unpopular opinion" thing is being overused to death. It is just an opinion. Adding "unpopular" doesn't make your opinion any more or less valid. End mini rant. 
---
Now, on to you post.  LFR and personal loot are bad, but transmog would be fine. That about the gist of it? 
---
"No changes except for my changes." Haven't seen that before.
---
If you have your monitor set for 144hz and you pull 100fps you will get screen tearing.  So there is really no point in going over 100hz.
---
You can call it a fix but it's a change it completely changes raiding it also makes the already easy content even easier.
---
Because people want to play VANILLA.  If they start changing a bunch of shit we're going to end up playing with some strange hybrid version of the game that could be complete shit.  
---
There are a few things I'd like to see changed as well (none of the garbage you're requesting here), but I completely understand the design philosophy behind 'no changes' and agree it's the proper way they need to move forward with the game.
---
I’d say:
---
8 warriors (3 Prot, 5 Fury)
---
5 priests (1 with shadow weaving)
---
3 Druids 
---
4 Paladins/Shamans
---
6 Rogues
---
7 Mages
---
4 Warlocks
---
3 Hunters
---
For Horde, arrange the groups so melee get windfury totem, MAYBE arranging the lowest melee DPS in to a group and moving their shaman to a healer group if mana is becoming an issue, but generally avoiding it since slowing the DPS increases the fight length.  
---
That should more or less have you covered for just about everything.  Obviously there is wiggle room depending on whether you are clearing for speed or attempting progression.
---
TRUE LULW
---
You literally made my old main
---
I didn't make the video. But that makes it seem like even less of an issue then, so I guess that only supports the theory that people were overly worried right?
---
AR is definitely not worth farming since it’ll be so easy to get MC/BWL weapons in Classic. A decent fury warrior can find a PUG without too many problems
---
My Google-fu has failed me; can anyone confirm if reputation reward dimishes with gray quests just like XP in the beta?
---
Ah, thanks
---
I feel personally attacked
---
As if you ever get to go to parties, you mean?
---
Yeah man you had reputation, you see the same people, u silently followed the progression of guilds and players, maybe to after a year of ”knowing of” getting to interract cuz a player happens to be the  with crusader online when you need it. This happens in many different ways each day!
---
You see how people behave in trade and in groups, who camps outside IF/OG dueling, there are even the quiet ones, the ones you admire from far, the ones who admire you, you flash your new epic from the raid and people will /w u gz and start saklig about progression and chat up a conversation —- these things
---
There were some ”social rebels”, the ones who would troll the server forums and call people out in trade chat, try to destroy social events (dueling tournaments n what not), the ones who loved to be hated and infamous. When there were trouble in guilds people quickly knew about it. When someone did something nasty to others word spread. Impossible to divide the sense of community into words haha..
---
I personally loved battlegroups because I was a hardcore PvPer in BG8 (Misery) and we had a great community between us with mIRC and people made alts to play with eachother and join guilds etc.
---
Healers make better raid/guild leaders than dps to be honest.
---
Don't try to main tank and raid lead (however main tank should be raid assist/officer and be in charge of the off tanks), but healing is fine. There are a lot of pros such as you looking less dispensable.
---
Yeah, while Naxx would be great, i don't really have any high expectations.  Right now we are just a group of friends that want to play and have fun.  We'll cross the Naxx bridge if/when we get to it.
---
And yeah, I really dont care much about trying to minmax.  I'm not forcing anybody into any roles (yet).
---
I didn’t know that, could i set my monitor to whatever Hz I want?
---
I didn't personally find it boring, but back then this game was so new and different from anything else at the time that even simple rotations and actions felt amazing so it's hard for me to be accurate with the nostalgia goggles on. I never remember feeling bored though if that helps.
---
What are the sham wombo comboos you referenced? For ranged and melee teach me master
---
In TBC druids were strong, they were broken in vanilla. I have a feeling a lot of people will choose druid this time around without realizing the time/gold/work commitment they need to be just decent in classic.
---
Have fun rolling enchanting and BS just for a tanking trinkets. You still need 6 other trinkets for 3 more specs.
---
I can't wait for August 28th when all the posts change to "NERF MAGES OMG BROKEN GAME".
---
As someone who was a druid main from Vanilla to Wrath, I can confidently say I've never experienced a more boring video
---
Doubt it'll be as profitable as it was back then. Beside, it's more for rogue alts than rogue mains, except if you don't want the gear ofcourse. 
---
But damn, back in vanilla I was one of the few rogues on my server that knew about it and I made retarded gold from it.
---
1. It would require way more work to balance out bosses, since unlimited debuff is a direct nerf. I will be playing Arms warrior and nobody will stop me from using MS. People had no problem clearing it with 8 slot debuff, I dont see a reason, why 15slots (considering one is MS) will be unacceptable. 
---
2. Transmog ruins the feel of accomplishment. You see a guy with certain sword, you know he is a tough boy. But if that sword is hidden under a skin of lvl4 green sword, it really doesnt feel right. Not to mention, in vanilla, you actually pick up on fights based on your opponent equipment, therefore seeing your target in full T2 or in dungeon equip, matters a lot.
---
3. Skyboxes?? really? The problem I see with you is, that you are trying to change the game for your needs. Philosophy of classic wow is, that you are thrown into world and you need to acclimate. I dont see a logical explanation, why would you have sunny day, when its 3am morning. All of these changes would be against mmorpg rules.
---
4. Even if you have created such poll, majority of people knows, those are the things, that ruined original WoW and you are basically advocating them. If these are the features that bothers you, maybe you should reconsider playing Classic.
---
Question about the warlocks (I should know this since I played one, but hey, 15 years is a long time):
---
I know the main curses to keep up are Shadow, Elements, and Recklessness; but is the fourth lock for weakness, or is that the lone dot lock fishing for nightfall procs?
---
Well who knows, either way I'm sure if it's that horrible and people still are frustrated they might change it sometime after launch. I don't know how it feels cause I wasn't in beta. Guess only time will tell.
---
55% of 1244 roughly 600 - reduced by 30% - about 400. Still a lot of Mana but you're going to do it for bashes, having good gear and innervate, you'll do it for feral charges plenty.
---
And sometimes you will definitely want to feral charge just to get - in - range of them to bash, if running away further isn't an option. 
---
But yeah think we agree on most.
---
Logitech has a [new MX518](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-mice/mx518-gaming-mouse.html). Not sure if they're any good, but it might be worth it to do some research into them if you're just looking for something simple.
---
You know how I search for stuff? I used duckduckgo and put reddit: blah blah blah.
---
Because reddit has more information and discussion when a question is presented. I personally prefer it to other mediums, and if you dont like it, why the fuck are you here? To turn this place into r/gameofthrones?
---
Just let it be brother
---
"that one idiot" was keeping up a meme. Holy crap you guys should wiggle your hips to get all that sand out of your vaginas. It was not about politics, only about a known figure. There was no political topic touched, nor did I asked for a debate. Mods of this sub, I'm disappointed.
---
Neat
---
No, it's not.
---
Same thing lol.. I also remember the paladin who helped me with mor ladin when I was duskwood, and saw him at 60 as well but clearly I'm wrong since someone is downvoting me lol
---
I just never played a caster during vanilla, so when I think of caster items I think the staff and hat. the training stick is actually not a terrible warrior weapon if they haven't gotten WW yet.
---
Yeah I saw a lot of "the more healers, the better" talk.  I wonder if that was just because we all sucked and needed the extra healing to compensate, or if the damage was actually that bad.
---
There was an old saying that retired priests usually rerolled hunter:)
---
So pretty much I should play mage, most milky chance I’ll get a raid spot?
---
Gold selling is unstoppable, it’ll probably be even more common in classic because if better bots and a very low cost of entry. Dying servers will probably get merged but thats down the line
---
1. Gold selling will be a thing.
---
2. &amp; 3. Free server transfers for those on dying realms. Disaster scenario merge two dying servers.
---
4. Who knows, maybe. Probably not unless interest exceeds their estimates and some servers remain too big.
---
There has been a ton of discussion about each of these.
---
Search bar says that all of these questions have been talked about in-depth. The problem being that official Blizzard staff does not come here and participate so there are never any official no answers here. But there is plenty of discussion.
---
Simply install on a different computer, then copy the program files to the company computer. There will be no official record of the software being installed on the PC
---
It is very easy for my part, as school doesn’t require me to be there physically and the curriculum is given out in advance. German is easy enough to study on my own, as I have done in the past semesters. Papers in other subjects will of course be prioritised when they are due, but that won’t be until early October. 
---
Basically, I’ll play the shit out of the game for the first weeks and get as geared and ready as I can for raids and stuff until the important assignments and papers show up.
---
I think the real top combo in Classic is Paladin/Warlock, but I'm not sure if people are aware of this yet or not.
---
I like the idea of leveling balance too and might play around with this, but you have to keep in mind that you will need to drink after every 2-3 mobs because you'll run out of mana. Consider going hybrid with feral so you can at least get feral swiftness for the increased movement speed to somewhat compensate for the high downtime. In addition, you can open in cat form with pounce, rake, rip. Then switch to caster after the roots kick in and finish them off with spells. This will also prolong your mana and reduce downtime.
---
I cannot fathom why my comment saying I might probably play priest or hunter is in the negative karma wise.
---
Is it confirmed what time character creation will open up? Are we assumed 3pm pdt, like launch?
---
Here's another wrong dictionary. 
---
 [https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/couple](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/couple)
---
Well this issue doesn't impact gameplay. If you really wanted to get up in arms about anything it should be layering.
---
I'm not hating and I see where you're coming from but I'm just saying I've personally experienced how bad private server chats get when left to their own devices. Back in vanilla WoW where things were moderated chat was a better and more game friendly experience vs private server chat. Some people may like that and that's fine but I'd reckon most people would prefer the vanilla experience.
---
Is 2 or 3 wishful thinking, or actively confirmed by Blizzard?
---
Because they haven't done server merges, or free transfers in over a decade.
---
I don't know if you try to build up on your incredibly cringy comment from before or actually trying to convince me you're mathematician. Just to clear it up: The Joke was simple and needed no addition, because every addition would be worse. And as a mathematician you might figure this one out: X - (X+1) = The Joke ; while x being the "fun" I got from reading the joke.
---
Yeah, this idea that hunters are easy and o/p is something that only applies to solo leveling. I don't think the guy I replied to saw the "pvp" part of the title.
---
Another point to where you see yourself from client to client (two account example), I learned about this from Vanilla BGs. Me and a teammate would be heading to the same objective, like the WSG flag or the first objective in AB (Stables/Farm). Even though it looked like I was ahead of everyone, and to me it seemed I clicked the objective first, another person would frequently get the grab/cap. And when I brought this up others confirmed that we were not seeing the same thing on our clients, by at least a few yards. 
---
I had pretty strong connection back then as well, usually lingering around 100MS in WoW, and much lower in FPS games where I could find a good, locally hosted server.
---
I agree 100%, but rebalance the classes on a different server. Keep one for the classic nochanges dudes.
---
The 8/8 proc is legitimately broken. Procs all the time for good damage and healing, doesn’t break gouge, and your character looks amazing. Best set ever.
---
None of these are critical to my enjoyment.
---
&gt; 1 mistake and now you have melee on you where you will do far less dps 
---
Hunters have it way better than other classes comparatively though. A hunter who is forced to melee has traps, Scatter Shot, Wing clip for slows, and on top of that can do quite decent damage with improved Raptor Strike (easy 1k crits on Cloth/Leather), on top of what you have a good HP pool, mail armor hence good damage mitigation, and Aspect of the Monkey (+ eventual Deterrence if you're classic PvP spec) to soak damage. In fact, with Deterrence and Immo trap up, I could melee equally geared arm specced Warrior without even using my ranged weapon as a Hunter. Only mages have better tools to deal with melees than Hunters.  
---
&gt; or a caster will be in your deadzone while you do 0 dps 
---
Again, only mages have what it takes to stay in your deadzone, as you have many abilities to deal with all the other classes wanting to exploit that weakness - and still, even mages do not have it necessarily very easy.
---
&gt; and a lot of it is split second decisions 
---
Like all classes to be honest. Quick reaction time is way more of a thing for rogues, mages or shamans. Again, hunters have it better than many others. Mistakes are way more punishing for pretty much all the other classes. Hunters have superb PvP tools in Vanilla, that's one of the reasons why they did not get almost anything interesting in BC compared to other classes.
---
Were there not patches that made class and talents better? That would make pve easier.
---
Yeah that was kind of the same vibe I was getting too.  Some sources said a Bear OT was fine.
---
Yeah 6 hours is about average for me also. Wife goes to bed around the same time as me though :(
---
There's plenty of discussion, but no information from Blizzard. These questions don't get asked in community interviews, they never get responded to by blues, and they aren't being discussed over and over again by community figures on podcasts.
---
I'm sure they gameplay was really compelling for Warlocks and Mages. Must have been why I dropped my favorite class so I could actually have fun raiding with the only three serious raiding guilds on my realm, which all denied me entry because of my spec.
---
With such a limited number of servers already for Classic it’s just kind of the expectation. It hasn’t been done in a decade because other changes have made those solutions unnecessary due to other features.
---
I was there first, 5 min ago. I claimed that mine, cleared it, planted the flag
---
I'd been running that mine all day, and along comes this trespasser into MY mine. Killing my precious mobs that drop the sweet sweet linen cloth. etc  /s  
---
There is a problem of consistency, I've had someone run up and mine from a node right next to me that had no mobs around, and they were annoyed when I started swinging as well, trying to salvage what was left of 'my node'. They thought it was their node because they hit it first. I thought it was mine because I was a few paces from it and was preparing to greet this stranger who'd just run up from 100m away.      
---
Getting there first = 100% of the resources           
---
OR            
---
It doesn't matter who gets there first, we share with any newcomers. If two of you are going for a node, you both help kill the mobs and split it between you after you've defeated them.      
---
Both ways we can do it, neither is more objectively right than the other. 
---
We could also have gone with "you always roll, if you're fighting mobs in front or not, if they're in the general area you roll on a per node basis"   
---
There are a few different rules people follow, just going by the replies to my post. To be on the safe side, if someone else is even looking in the direction of  distant node, let them have it.
---
Hate them as a mage. Can't escape, hard to deadzone kite, loses mana to viper sting.. urgh
---
As I said the drops are a pretty recent addition I'd started doing as well. The concept of the series initially was for my own benefit of knowing what and where the quests came from more than a "how to" or a "go here for this gear" type thing.
---
I don’t think it’s as much of a matter of people standing in fire as it was a lack of hard dps checks. That’s one reason why vael was such a guild killer
---
They are fine until AQ, not having crit mitigation means they get one shot
---
Very cool!
---
Haha, boots! I mean boots! Damn all my arguments are invalid now :’(
---
BiS for shadow, healer, or both?
---
Probably because either they've been addressed or they don't warrant being addressed
---
Can a standard fury warrior build (17/34/0) tank all the classic dungeons provided they replace some pre-raid BIS leather/mail gear with mitigation plate? I want to be able to dungeon tank and raid DPS without sucking at both.
---
This wasn't in vanilla though, must have been added in one of the shitty expansions (TBC?)
---
How on earth is server health 'not something warrants being addressed'?
---
Easiest way is to max level first and farm appropriate level dungeons later. My 3rd 60 was a priest, and I ended farming low level dungeons on my Pally. I was basically able to so-farm on the Pally up to ZF which was enough to get into end game materials anyways. Eventually I bought a 2nd account and ran myself through dungeons as I did this and had a couple buddies come along to level their toons too as I ran through. Made it very worthwhile.
---
Getting cloth for tailors (especially mageweave) or rare blues that were good for PVP twinks made it pretty profitable too.
---
If memory serves correct my preferred dungeon routes were:
---
1 - Deadmines
---
2 - Stockades
---
3 - SM: Cath
---
4 - ZF
---
Picked those because the amount of humanoids meant lots of cloth. Ideally you'd be able to solo your own runs as an enchanter, but it's profitable enough that you can just buy your mats with the money you make too without bringing the toon you're doing enchanting on.
---
I would argue that raiding will be much easier anyway. Ws already know the encounters. It's 2019. We will have YouTube guides for all bosses before the game is even launched.
---
Yeah you’re right. I think I’m being overly hopeful. It’s crazy how little information I really know even though I’ve been doing so much of my own research. Have we reached a definitive verdict on if we are starting with 8 or 16 debuff slots?
---
Hope you find/found work bud. 
---
The silly side of me wants to say this is you truly getting ready for classic. I have distinctive memories of about half my guild being high school students and the other half being unemployed adults.
---
They can open up new servers to keep things fresh. They could open up a couple during the 2 year cycle so the stragglers can jump in. Then when Naxx has run its course they could end the "season" and keep all the toons on perma servers, then open up some fresh seasonal servers. The perma-servers could be merged (yea I get people hate merged servers, but it's better than having an empty server).
---
&gt; Literally the words I used were: ...
---
..."Cata killed WoW"
---
And that statement is objectively false.
---
If you had said "I don't like the changes that came with Cata. They killed the game FOR ME" I wouldn't have said anything, and your comment would simply be irrelevant to the larger conversation. However you made a statement of fact, and that statement was incorrect.
---
&gt; You are literally refusing to acknowledge that there is anyone who preferred Vanilla over modern WoW.
---
The fact that you preferred vanilla to modern has nothing to do with the current state of the game, which is very much alive.
---
&gt; You interpret all my opinions as statements of fact.
---
I interpret your statements of fact as statements of fact. Don't like it? Don't make objectively false statements.
---
&gt; I point out Asmongold's opinion and you say 1) he's an ass 2) he doesn't represent literally everyone.
---
If he doesn't represent everyone, then his opinion cannot be extrapolated to your claim that WoW is dead. As long as there are still people playing a game, then it isn't dead, and wow is still an extremely popular game.
---
In fact, I'll just tell you straight up that he isn't representative of the wow community at large. His viewership of rabid fanboys isn't a significant fraction of the playerbase. Thus his opinion is just that... an opinion. Not the opinion of the WoW community, either. Just HIS opinion.
---
He definitely IS an ass, though. You get that bonus fact for free.
---
If we speak only in terms of PvP, I think shaman (30/0/21) is what you're describing :P
---
I had hard time deciding between priest and shaman, but I can't play orc priest so I ended up on shaman.
---
Absolutely. It's fairly easy to get to a gear level as a warrior where you no longer are in any danger of dying to any 5 man content at 60. At that point, really your benefit to the group is how much threat and damage you do. So really fury dps tank, at a certain point, becomes much better than a prot tank for 5 mans. The intersection tends to happen after you have all the gear you need from 5 mans though.
---
Retail is chasing a carrot on a stick
---
Classic is choose your own adventure
---
Different people enjoy different things. I doubt Classic will influence retail in any way.
---
Listen, pleb. I'm a **moderator** of a subreddit, and not just any subreddit, oh no, but a subreddit for an *MMORPG* with over ONE-HUNDRED AND FIFTY-THOUSAND SUBSCRIBERS. Of *course* you're "confused" - you're a normie! You'll never wield the power granted to me by my **BAN HAMMER!** /s
---
I hope that sarcasm helps return you to your regularly scheduled hatred and contempt... don't want to tip the scales too much.
---
I didnt use keybinds for abilities until half way through BWL. I was a holy priest. Clicked everything.
---
2.0 ret tree for paladins pls
---
&gt; people sre asking for something to do past nax with their characters
---
It seems obvious to me that Bliz wouldnt delete their recreation of Classic Vanilla (by overwriting it) in any case.
---
So I think it's a safe assumption that either Classic+ OR Classic TBC would be on new servers, but allow you to copy your characters over.
---
That preserves the historical game of Vanilla while adding more content. So the debate is between what that new content will be... Either a proven game that dead ends in a few years, or new content that couod potentially learn from the mistakes of the past and continue to improve indefinitely.
---
Personally I have reduced my work to 80%. One day off every week. It can be done by law of you have kids between 0 and 12. I don’t do it for the kids at all. I do it to be alone at home and do whatever I want. So one day a week I can play for 8 hours straight if I want too. Autumn and winter gaming I look forward too. Fuck summer....it’s almost over anyway
---
It [wasn't specified](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule). So yeah, we don't know yet.
---
We'll be adding DKP and loot council tools to ClassicRaids soon!  In the meantime, OP, you should check out our [classic wow guild recruitment](https://wow.classicraids.com/guilds) to get an idea of what other guilds are doing and get a jump start on recruiting for your guild.
---
The thing about gearing a shaman that way is that it's easier to get the items you want since there's usually only competition from other shamans, but there are far fewer items to want.
---
No matter how popular shaman may have seemed in the beta, there's no way there'll be so many that the competition for BiS items is steeper than it is for, say, mages/warlocks or rogues/warriors/hunters. Shaman was popular in the beta because the level cap favored the class to an extreme degree, but literally all statistics from every private server and from retail vanilla has always shown shaman as average to below average in popularity. There's no reason it would skyrocket in Classic, even though a couple of useless polls suggested that it might. I'd be shocked if the average number of shamans in raid guilds is any higher than four or five.
---
However, let's say that for mages T2 boots are BiS. They may be approximately as hard to get as T2 boots are for a shaman, but if you don't get them, mages have several other options for boots that are good enough. Shamans don't. There'll be one or maybe two items per slot that are worth wearing at all, instead of several in every slot like healers, tanks and the pure DPS classes have. That's the tricky part.
---
So gearing for elemental is easy in the sense that the best items become available pretty early, aren't particularly rare, and no other classes really want them; but it's hard in the sense that if you just don't get that BiS helm from Onyxia, there isn't a satisfying second best item to wear.

#  The Argent Vanguard
---
DnD style, Argent Dawn-themed Roleplay
---
**TAVG Discord Server:** [**https://discord.gg/Dvh33f7**](https://discord.gg/Dvh33f7)
---
**TAVG Website:** tavg-classic . wowlaunch . com
---
# Introduction; In-Universe
---
The Vanguard, commonly known as the ‘Argent Spear’ was originally created in order to allow the Dawn to strike at foes in the farthest corners of the plaguelands of Lordaeron.
---
Over the years as they gradually discovered the agents of both the Burning Legion and the Scourge have spread to the civilized regions of the world, the Dawn started deploying them as an expeditionary force.
---
Nowadays they are known to operate all across Azeroth. Anywhere evil rears its ugly head, they will be there to meet it.
---
# Introduction; Out of Character
---
The Argent Vanguard aims to be the premier roleplaying destination for all your Argent Dawn themed roleplaying needs on Classic WoW.
---
We will offer:
---
* Weekly events &amp; multi-part campaigns.
---
* A commendation system for tracking player achievements.
---
* A defined path of progression, with multiple platoons &amp; roles to fill.
---
* Our own, home-brew RPG system for events.
---
* Discord server.
---
* A community site.
---
Our Roleplay will be grounded in canonical lore, with our events taking place during the Vanilla timeline. This does not mean however that concepts expanded upon and introduced in later expansions can’t be introduced into our stories, within reason.
---
We wish to emphasize persistence through our Roleplay, so we will often spend long periods of time away from major Roleplaying hubs, even outside of guilds events.
---
We also wish to manage &amp; maintain a PvE &amp; PvP wing of the guild to fully exploit the content offered by the game.
---
With the Vanguard there will be no downtime, always having something to do.
---
# Our Home-brew RPG System
---
Over the many years of Roleplaying on retail WoW, our group of friends developed a rather simple rule-set to govern the outcome of combat during our events.
---
It started out simple, became over-bloated with features before it was all scaled back into a more light-weight system.
---
It uses multiple dices &amp; a straightforward stat system.
---
It’s easy to learn &amp; hard to master. It’s a system fit for just about any character archetype out there with no restrictions on class.
---
It allows players to feel powerful, while still presenting challenging encounters.
---
# Unit Structure
---
The Vanguard has multiple permanent units for organizational purposes, as well as smaller temporary ones for operational purposes.
---
In itself the Vanguard is a Company of the Argent Dawn.
---
It is comprised of multiple, permanent Platoons that fulfil different tasks.
---
The Platoons are then broken down into Squads.
---
Squads are temporarily organized into Teams for the duration of a mission.
---
# Events
---
Events in the Vanguard will fall into multiple categories.
---
* Roleplaying events with an emphasis on storytelling &amp; roleplay. Our main focus.
---
* PvE events, where we clear dungeons and quest together.
---
* Raid events, where we clear raids.
---
* PvP events, where we travel the world in search of Open World PvP.
---
* Battleground events, where we enter a BG as an organized group.
---
During Roleplay events the Dungeon Master will direct the flow of action, with Players responding to them accordingly.
---
Ultimate player freedom &amp; actions having consequences will be the values governing our RP events.
---
# Rank &amp; Progression
---
The first promotion for every member from a Trial status to a Regular will come after a certain time in service to the guild.
---
Following this, players will have at their disposal a unique system to help track their progress in the guild and earn promotions, special equipment &amp; more.
---
Occasionally the Vanguard will award one-time, campaign specific ribbons.
---
# Persistence &amp; Meta-game
---
Our guild will utilise a unique system to help with day-to-day player engagement and spontaneous Roleplay.
---
Our meta-game will revolve around working towards the stability of the world as fit for the Argent Dawn theme.
---
Depending on the guild’s weekly contributions, we may be better or worse off during guild events.
---
Very useful, thanks. Gotta find a Mage friend to supply me with water while going out for long leveling sessions or I'll be flat broke buying inn water.
---
Don't level enchanting while you're leveling. It's a trap. You really do need the gold generated from selling things.
---
After you're 60 it's very easy to run old dungeons for enchanting materials. At 60 you can also just sell high level materials to buy lower level materials.
---
There is no race to get your enchanting up. Nothing in 5-man content is problematic to tank as a Bear.
---
It's not a nightmare, just makes raiding more exciting. Soulstone is the best threat reset in the game btw.
---
I would skullfuck the shit out of her
---
What about warlocks on alliance side?
---
Do you have any confidence that tier 0.5 is going to be available in phase 1/2?
---
Would there be more lag for me if I was a west coast player playing on an east coast server?
---
Tell that to my macro mouse I have been using for 7+ years;)
---
Yeah WSG is where feral druids very famously thrived. I was very casual in PvP throughout my WoW days. My Warrior was terrible with PvP, likely because I was casual and didn't know how to play him properly. I always heard Warriors were awesome. I remember playing AB witb my Druid as a healer and kind of camping out near an otherwise unoccupied flag in stealth my ability to not die while waiting for reinforcements was fairly good and I got some joy out of transforming to travel form and running away from melee/breaking out of CC. Come to think about it though I wasn't the best at keeping my teammates alive...just myself. It's been YEARS my memory is hazy, can't wait to get back into the fray. Although I don't think I'll be doing too much PvP and I probably won't roll a Druid or Warrior.
---
You could go hybrid druid. Support with heals, but can also run the flag. Wpvp as rogue/druid will be super strong as you can always pick your fights
---
I've made my life unbusy. 
---
No job, no responsibilities, no worries. Plenty of money saved. 
---
Gonna no-life it just Kripp no life'd Diablo 3.
---
True. But difficulty to enforce means one thing. Fuck that rule;)
---
Yep
---
The only good answer.
---
Warrior is the best tank.
---
It is going to be a gold sink no matter what you do. The only thing you can do to try to offset it is to make sure you are only DEing undesirable greens that won't sell beyond their vendor price. 250+ is when it starts getting noticeably expensive and you'll begin questioning whether you will ever sell enough enchants at a high enough profit to make up for all the gold you are throwing away.
---
Can't speak for Druids or Priests, but I can for shamans. Chain Heal is everything and breaking 3pc Tier2 is basically never a good idea unless your raid decides you're just MT healing.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
`Salamander Scale Pants` Not replaced until Naxx.
---
`Hide of the Wild` Shamans use this too. Replacement timeline is correct.
---
`Wild Growth Spaulders` Not replaced until Naxx.
---
`Shroud of Pure Thought` Not replaced until Naxx.
---
`Boots of Pure thought` Shamans never replace these.
---
`Robes of the Guardian Saint` Shamans until Naxx as well.
---
`Eye of the Dead` Shamans too.
---
I'm lost.
---
Yes, it does.
---
Pretty sure you can just boost some of the environment such as water graphics.. or keep it how it was in vanilla
---
Weighted classes? Yeah, no. I can understand prioritizing a melee weapon for a rogue over a hunter or a ranged weapon for a hunter over a rogue. But to deny ALL items from a person because they play a different class is just... beyond what I thought was possible in terms of stupidity. But anyway it doesn't really matter. Ninja looting is simply obtaining an item you weren't entitled to. The reasons for not being entitled to it don't really matter.
---
You'll get pre bis (dps set) very quick if you have the time to chain dungeon queue as a tank and just invite caster dps. Sounds a bit mean but really there'll be an endless sea of dps looking for dungeons so it's just a nice bonus of being a tank.

Hunters had their deadzone removed in tbc which is the #1 reason mistakes are punishing. And mage isn't the only class that can take advantage of a deadzone, they are just the best. all casters can, and will, if you let them. have a lock deathcoil/fear you and toss you full of dots then camp in your deadzone. you have to scatter him and get some distance just to start dpsing, and he will be coming back towards you, causing you to dps on the move. same if you let a priest or shaman get too close. there is a reason literally every caster will try for your deadzone while the bad ones will stand there and try to duke it out with you.
---
And compare mistakes to a druid. you fucked up? run away with travel form and stealth. mage? sheep and reset the fight. warlock? not much to even fuck up,  ut you can refer and get distance to reset a fight? rogue? blind or vanish and reset the fight. warrior I will give you, but that is the only one I agree with. hunters can do that to certain classes (rogue and warrior), but that is assuming the big fuckup wasn't missing a trap or doing it to close to scatter and getting 5 seconds out of it.
---
I do agree that there are great tools to deal with melee if you fuck up, but that doesn't apply to casters. hell, if you let a lock get up on you at all you are probably going to die just from dots by the time you are able to dps him down. 
---
And that isn't even counting group pvp. if I'm low health I can get in a hunter deadzone to buy some time for a heal, which is something that cannot happen to any other class. a big reason why I like playing hunter because you have to pay attention to that deadzone at all times.
---
They haven't done server merges because they abandoned the single server clusters we have.  The current system doesn't need a marger, since every zone you go in will be phased with multiple servers.
---
It's what they did in vanilla, would make sense it would work the same for classic.
---
Yeah, I'm actually pretty convinced there will be plenty of layed back guilds who will have a bit more relaxed demands for raiding and who will be perfectly fine with suboptimal compositions.
---
Can MC be used from Shadowmeld? 🤔
---
I write the most specific question and your lost ,maybe my dialect unfamiliar (?)
---
I know this is a shitpost but lock rarely has pet out in raids, hunter is the only one that really has to think about race
---
I dont think mages have the water elemental pet or if they do it's a CD and orcs cant be mages just play whatever race you like most honestly
---
Windfury makes 2h very good.
---
I would definitely not give warriors Vis'kag over rogues on the horde side since we can use Double Deathbringers. I don't agree with a few others but I'm sure if this showed what's for Horde/Ally there would be less confusion, non the less good job for putting this together for you and the community.
---
Shaman has crossed my mind, being a Thrall wannabe would be cool.  I want to be an undead clothie though for extra angsty emo-ness.
---
It's Battle Shout that is divided threat. Demo Shout is static threat to each mob. This makes DS better once you have 7 or more mobs, and BS (on all 5 party members) better below 7 mobs. At 6 mobs they are almost equal but a full BS is slightly better. Remember to get the full bonus from BS all party members must be in range and in combat. BS gives threat even if it is being reapplied.  
---
From [Kenco's Threat Guide](https://nostalrius.org/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=16499&amp;sid=226dc83b91d93d2e6a5f22c3729ffa69):  
---
&gt; Battle Shout generates 55 threat for each player that is buffed; up to 5 people in your party and their pets, as long as they are on the relevant mob's threat list. For example if you buff a player that is out of combat, no threat is generated. Therefore in a tightly packed group, Battle Shout can rival Sunder Armor for threat, but as a buff the threat is split amongst all the mobs that are aware of you. On the other hand, Demoralizing Shout gives 43 threat to each affected mob. As long as there are 6 or more mobs affected, it will hold aggro as well or better than Sunder Armor.
---
My highly unique solution to layering is paid layers.  Everyone gets stuck at the login screen with 200,000 people in front of them to log into their server.  If they pay enough money they can jump queue to get into the only layer for their server.  There would be no more need for layers.  Players could have the 2019 micro transactions they want and have come to expect in their new video games.  Everyone would be happy, and Activision-Blizzard would increase their quarterly earnings.
---
the high int is the biggest selling point of both sets.
---
arround 6.5k mana unbuffed is great for PvP.  
---
the T sets for mages are also not that far off from the R10 set.  
---
health values close to or upwards of 4k are possible.
---
Seeing chat spams for "LFM - Need &lt;Role&gt;" - and being able to whisper them with "I can do that".
---
That’s pretty bad ass.
---
Then people just launder money through a second account.  What if I trade money that was bought through a seller to a popular streamer?  Should they get banned too?
---
You can't just throw ban hammers at gold buyers.  You try your best to ban the sellers to minimize their impact on the game.
---
It's imaginary. The casuals are getting upset over people who barely exist.
---
My girlfriend's guild was a progression guild and they were competing for world firsts, their original tank was an undead. The worst race for a tank.
---
Yeah I said it in another post but you illustrated the point better than me. To ninja is simply to take an item that was expected to go to someone else, regardless of how the decision came about.
---
Questions are shitpost now, ok lad , tell me this then why does destruction locks have an imp summon ,you telling me locks in classic wow are fighting by themselves ?
---
You become revealed when you begin casting from shadowmeld in 1.12.
---
pm'd
---
You don't want hybrid pieces for healing you want healing pieces for healing.   You're gonna have to swap gear around.
---
No one can’t blame her. And it’s too late now for you. When I remarried I made sure that my wife would agree to not work 100% again the rest of her life. At least as long as we have kids that needs attention. It helps to be completely retarded with kids stuff like I am ofc lol.
---
As far as I know, BUYING stuff was never considered a "crime," rather it was the sellers that were always targeted.
---
What about the Pal and Shams? Dps or healing? And what about a Pal tank?
---
Flagging for pvp as a alliance Hunter in the barrens, taming a low level plainstrider, use the spell to take control of your pet, run at lowbies and get them to flag themselves by attacking your pet.
---
*looks at female dwarves*
---
On the other hand, because Horde warriors gain Windfury and the druid likely won't have GoA the gap in threat between warriors up to druids is smaller on the Horde side. Thanks to warriors having higher threat, the gain of using a feral druid is diminished.
---
Paladins cant tank raids full stop. Paladins are 3 healers maybe 1 ret if not 4 healers
---
If you do not punish buyers, then nothing happens. They will just keep buying because there will always be a market for sellers to start over. You will never stop sellers long term
---
I'd say go with 1440p high refresh rate for sure. You can easily see what monitors are within your price range here: https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/products/monitor/#r=256001440&amp;D=144000,180000&amp;sort=price&amp;page=1
---
Too toxic for eve - wow!
---
This is nothing. Make a friend enemy side, send him to Razorhill/Goldshire to kill low level players, then Mind Control him, spam Power Word Shield. It'll end your mind control channel, but he'll be shielded. Works with every instant cast spell.
---
Buff, renew, shield your enemy allies!
---
You die, you get ported to nearest gy (you don't need to have explored it), you res. That's always how it has worked and will worked. Yes you can use that to get somewhere more quickly than running. You might even be able to get an addon that tells you which gy you will be ported to at any moment, but I don't know of any yet.
---
I plan on being an orc warlock destruction specialization because of the 5% pet damage buff,which means max dps vs every other class correct ?
---
I don’t wanna play what I want , I wanna play the best DPS race for that class
---
Well, yes, that is what I said. You abruptly went from level 58 levelling gear to stuff equivalent to pre-raid BiS for a 60 give or take. Because that gap had to be closed somehow.
---
By the time you were 70 and pre-raid geared you were in stuff equivalent to Naxx gear, give or take, because that gap had to be closed somehow too.
---
They spread out the gear gain as far as they could, if it took any longer then Naxx gear would have overshadowed Tier 4.
---
I pm'd you, hopefully we are what you're looking for!
---
How do you know that blizzard hasn’t improve the AI since your gaming experience ,especially for new players (?)
---
Mostly there as back up in case one of the others has to drop out.  Everything is negotiable obviously, but the idea is that if any one player drops you aren’t left without a back up.  
---
I know you asked for roles, but I thought that comp more or less gave a good indication of what one should be shooting for.  You could easily replace one of the Prot warriors with a good bear, and most of the pure DPS (warriors, rogues, mages) are interchangeable as a matter of not bringing anything unique like at least 3 locks for curses, at least 2 hunters for Tranq, 3-4 Paladins/shamans for blessings/totems.  
---
Point is no on individual is going to mess up raid night if they decide to leave.
---
CAT DURID IS FOR FITE
---
That... has nothing to do with the engine.
---
intro is too loud and your voice only playes in the left ear.
---
That’s my kinda play style then.
---
Even after you make the chest, you can keep creating mooncloth bags.
---
Have you seen bfas pet ai, I have 0 hope it has improved
---
I know, but it's not like there's anywhere else to go.
---
Fuck the gnomes
---
Warlocks scale well into later raids, and some AQ fights they kick face.
---
Alliance side warlock population is lower than Horde side, so you have that going for you.
---
they're tradeable and drop from trash
---
They don't use it even at naxx level
---
&gt;base health
---
You just exposed yourself retailer
---
fucker so good he dont even need combo points got dang
---
Even if she didn't work I would still help her out when I got home. Its not just her responsibility to take care of our kid. What do you mean its to late for me? I enjoy being a father as its very rewarding. And nobody knows what there doing when it comes to parenting. I think you are using that as a excuse to get out of helping.
---
Don't let your memes be dreams.
---
TIL. Thank you!
---
Will have to make some nice RP macro for this..
---
Yes, they are wrong if they claim the same. Couple has never meant more than or less than 2 lol.
---
The cycle of life can be cruel
---
 http://youtube.com/watch?v=1QximOcF5T8  heres a vid from back in the day
---
On the horde side, definitely priest.  For wpvp you're pretty versatile, strong if you go shadow and offheal, and even if you stay a full healer you have a lot of powerful tools to ruin everyone else's day.  In BGs you are the only defensive dispel class on horde side, so you're much more valuable than you would be on alliance side (who also have pally), and your dispel is also offensive (shaman have purge, but no defensive dispel).
---
You could go druid, but you'll be relegated mostly to flag running which won't allow you to heal much or support your friends.
---
Yeah, certain debuffs, such as Sunder Armor are considered high priority, and won't fall off when the debuff limit is reached.  Other debuffs like, serpent sting or corruption will be removed as other debuffs are added on.
---
Like I said, unless you guild is trying to minmax really hard, it's not going to matter very much.  MS was a much bigger deal back when we only had the 8-debuff limit.
---
Talents, sure, but some classes were way more OP in early vanilla.
---
Immediately heard the song in my mind.  and YES!
---
I might get over my hatred of large crowds enough to go that!
---
In a decent guild this doesn't happen.
---
man I was using a 1h + shield well into northrend on my ret pally because I thought the extra survivability would help me quest until someone called me a noob in a dungeon
---
I enjoyed this thread.
---
Hahaha, ok this got me.
---
Yea I get that but how do you get them personally? Ask guildees to trade to you?
---
Fear the living.
---
Except nightfall is way better than anything a feral brings, and fury prot has a far better oh shit I'm tanking cds than a feral. Try again
---
I do,hope is why I’m playing classic wow
---
Ranged is based on lb-&gt;Cl-&gt;shock, melee ranged is fire nova-&gt;cl-&gt;shock
---
Depending on your talents, use of grenades etc, this combo cane be charged to suit the situation. I.e. warstomp, trinket use, grenades, NS/EM, etc.
---
I’m mostly a PvP guy but Holy and Ret Paladin were both super fun and fulfilling for me, both PvP and PvE. Blessings and auras are some passive buffs that make the whole party better, but there’s lots of fun stuff you can actively do to help your group. 
---
As a Ret Paladin, Lay on hands can be the difference between wiping on an encounter or saving a tank/healer just in time. Normally wouldn’t want to use this as a healer because without mana your group is in trouble anyways. 
---
Cleanse is incredibly powerful in PvP, and so are Blessing of Freedom and Blessing of Sacrifice. It’s so amusing to put BoS on your ally to pull yourself out of crowd control. Or just cleanse your ally out of polymorph.
---
I'll be mostly solo until 60, unfortunately. I figure I'll get killed a lot, but there are probably things I can do to get killed a little bit less often, like stick to lower-pop zones or run a lot of dungeons. I'm just wondering if anyone else has had any luck with that sort of thing.
---
I know the thread is specifically about tanking superiority, but as a vanilla tauren druid and emphatic Horde enthusiast I always really envied NE druids for their advantages in world content and PVP.  I made fun of them for being "run and hide spec" (wisp, dodge, meld, improved stealth), but tbh their racials really seem to be more useful for every spec.  The only valid argument for choosing the cow over the purple elf imo is For The Horde!
---
Fury did not begin to beat Rogues in vanilla Naxx. Again, this happened on private servers, where Fury is overtuned due to bad coding.
---
&gt;The most popular private server cores have now been confirmed to have inflated boss armor values.
---
Completely irrelevant.
---
&gt;This armor decrease will help warriors even more.
---
It literally doesn't, armor decrease on the enemy helps warriors just as much as rogues lol...
---
Fury Warriors absolutely are a lot worse in Classic since they have significantly lower crit chance.
---
Here is your answer in a way a little shit like you will understand. You are retarded if you base your choice of class on efficiency. It’s World of Warcraft not Word of DPS Meters.
---
Yeah, at the moment, I'm not trying to dictate what any of my members should play, but I'm still trying to bring at least the minimum.  
---
Right now I'm the lone druid in the group, and I'm okay with that, lol.

I actually agree with this. Those wholesome "look what my wife did for me because I was excited" types of posts are always better than the memes in my opinion. And in a lot of cases, I'd even say are much higher-effort posts overall. Some memes and jokes are pretty good, though. I don't laugh much at anything I see posted places anymore, but those Ed, Edd, and Eddy ones on this sub are gold.

Everything currently open.
---
Nice, is it also a route optimized for fastest way to 60?
---
Lol.  I don't think you know what a snowflake is.  I guess wanting people to fuck off and mind their own business and deal with their own problems themselves is being a snowflake now.  Jesus, listen to yourself.
---
Too bad bear threat was overturned on pservers so threat will be even worse for them.

Got it so there is a 1% chance it will matter

Problem is that in the greater MMORPG genre the old style of MMORPG is dead. Absolutely dead. Every MMORPG evolved out of that classic style of MMORPG to focus on instant gratification and removal of any and all barriers, mechanical and social. WoW Classic is the rare chance to go back to something that was abandoned by the supply side of the market. Problem is that retail WoW still makes shit tons of money from microtransactions despite the lowest subscription numbers ever. So even if WoW Classic demand is absolutely roaring then it could still be ignored on the back bench and just be in dreaded 'maintenance mode' after all phases are launched.
---
hah I levelled my paladin as holy because I didn't know wtf the word "retribution" meant and I was certainly not interested in protecting anyone.
---
Just two melee in a UBRS group? Absolutely unheard of.
---
Yeah you couldn’t be more wrong.
---
So the tanks buffs are better than priest/Druid hots? Or is it there a specific hot that’s not worth it?
---
In what situation does your guild ever let you SS yourself though.
---
And I know you were joking but for others who dont know, no it's not.  In many encounters, pulling aggro long enough to get killed for an SS aggro reset would ruin the attempt.
---
I can feel your anger....yet it doesn’t make your case stronger,however prick,shit are all insults that have minor impact to the question you refuse to answer on your first response (?)
---
Holy crap! 
---
How long did it take you? Looks awesome!
---
Oh boy this community sure does love making up problems that don't exist.
---
Nothing wrong with that. They're massive streamers that bring massive communities along with them. If you like Twitch chat, you'll probably like that crowd. If you find Poggers Kappa PeePeeBalls or whatever they say annoying, I would steer clear.
---
tfw the petition works and this post gets deleted
---
I was im beta, they are using legion pet AI
---
I am going to play hunter and completely agree. Its very rarely going to actually be bis for hunters. In theory if they have every other bis item in phase 2 then it is the best, but in reality it probably won't be bis based on your other gear.
---
The slowest of them all!
---
Slightly but it’s pretty much unnoticeable
---
Why are you rolling on a PvP server *'with friends'* but mostly soloing to 60?
---
Where are said friends in all of this?
---
WoW Realm forums were the best bit of banter in 2004/05.
---
Wow awesome!
---
Thanks for anoher tip on how to troll the trolls.
---
I’m 25 years  old , I don’t wish to enjoy anything ,I wish to play the game and be as effective in it as possible
---
No, that's after taking into account the fact that it's a one-faction class. If you look at the stats page of the server that rhymes with Gothmale, you get the following:
---
Warrior 20.39%  
---
Paladin 6.3%  
---
Hunter 12.5%  
---
Rogue 13.4%  
---
Priest 9.5%  
---
Shaman 6.2%  
---
Mage 14.4%  
---
warlock 10.5%  
---
Druid 6.9%
---
And if we say that the playerbase is roughly 50/50 (it's more like 52/48 on that server, but whatever), shaman is ahead of only druid, priest and warlock. This is how it has been on every server. It's literally only on the Classic beta that shaman has been popular because, like I mentioned, it's a powerful class around level 30-40.
---
Do you have to remake the shield every time or simply repair it at a vendor?
---
I am too
---
You mean the spec that isn't useful in pve ?
---
I’d say meme specs are the ones where someone says “I’m a [spec] [class]” and that’s your clearest indicator they don’t know what they are doing.  You’re a ret Paladin?  Why?  Your DPS sucks, and there’s nothing you can do about that.   At best you blow a bunch of consumables and maybe equal a face rolling DPS class.  You’re a feral Druid?  Do you KNOW what you have to do to succeed at that?  
---
Classic raiding is more about bringing the class, not the spec, and that’s an individual’s responsibility to understand what is expected of their class and what it’s capable of.  
---
Obviously if you’re off on your own, you can do whatever you want.  Knock yourself out.  When you’re playing with others, do your best to fulfill your role in the group/raid.  If you find yourself falling back on “I’m [spec] [class]” as an excuse, you’re a meme spec.  
---
Unless you’re talking about hunters, who are the only actual meme class because they universally pull the same shit, and the ones that don’t get snatched up for actually knowing what they are doing.
---
So then wtf have I been doing for that past 2 years....
---
woosh
---
It's not optimal for pve obviously.
---
why would you want a nelf rogue though?
---
You obviously never encountered any [Dickwolves](https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2010/08/11).
---
If you walk without rhythm you won't attract the worm
---
DURIDS IS 4 haf FUN TIME WIT FRENS every1 is like a fun time durid!!
---
Because you are not just using your rotation normally, powershifting is a unique mechanic not just a regular spell...
---
Oh boy I'm ganna need two nooses after reading that.

what does mushroom beat?

**&lt;Sharp And Shiny&gt; | NA | RP - PvE | Progression Raiding Guild**
---
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
---
**Who are we:** &lt;Sharp and Shiny&gt; is a PvE progression focused guild made up of a mix of folks with original vanilla and private server experience as well as other MMOs. We are currently looking for more to round out our pre launch roster.
---
**What to expect from us:** Those who choose to be a part of our guild can expect to be a part of a focused but relaxed raiding environment that will clear fresh content quick and effectively. In classic, we want to put a larger focus on having more casual members or socials to in the future allow for more out of main raid activities, such as PvP, dungeons, and raid PuGs, which we hope will reduce the onset of raid log mentality.
---
**What we expect from you:** We have a 80% minimum raid attendance requirement. We intend to be in Molten Core 4 weeks after launch at the latest and have a hard leveling time cap of 6 weeks to hold a raid spot. After hitting cap, we expect each raider to be working towards their pre raid BiS as well as farming for their raid consumables. We expect every member to act mature, especially to those outside of the guild, as we will be very conscious of our guilds reputation on the server that we choose to play. Mainly just don't be a dick.
---
**Why RP-PvE?:** The community. While the guild itself is not RP restricted and we have no RP expectations for any of our members, we are rolling on a RP server to avoid the elitism and toxicity that is sometimes prevalent on PvE and PvP servers. We also plan on possibly holding server community events that we believe will be more accepted on an RP server.
---
**Raid times:** Sun/Tues 6:00 - 9:00 PST with a potential third day added come phase 5
---
**Loot system:** Loot Council
---
**What are we currently looking for?:**
---
Mages
---
Dwarf Priest
---
If you don't fit these rolls feel free to apply, as we will always be welcoming of exceptional applicants of any class.
---
 **If you have any questions or want to apply, come join our discord.**

When doing the heigan dance I'd often have to walk ahead of the graphic on the floor bc if I walked with it on everyone else's screen I would get hit while on my screen I wouldn't. This was with &lt;100 ping. Has something to do with how the client and server communicate.
---
Seal Fate Swords only starts to compete with Seal Fate Daggers once you have 25% unbuffed crit chance, which doesn't happen until Naxx.
---
Seal Fate Daggers only starts to compete with Combat once you have 15% unbuffed crit chance, which doesn't happen until AQ.
---
Maces never compete.
---
Transmog would ruin EVERYTHING.
---
Is WSG any fun as a resto shaman or will everyone in your pug be thinking "damn if only he was a one-shot lightning god"?
---
How about premades?
---
The best use for those kind of macros (the hold down = spam activity ones) is to make target + startattack macros to tag on launch imo. It'll actually be crucial not to get stuck in the zerg for too long.
---
"added in patch 1.13"? Guess that one isn't possible then
---
So they're shafting the community because they don't want to devote the necessary resources? Sounds entirely plausible and in character for ActiBlizz.
---
Though I'm sure that players would be far more willing to forego proper customer support just for the chance at having the features they want and not having their game destroyed, just like what happened with loot sharing (after community outcry and against ActiBlizzard's initial decision).
---
Something they shouldn't do, but it's also pretty easy to see the difference between trading with McCarry lv 60 and Jdbeicbfbe lv 5
---
Good luck with that man! I hope I'll meet like minded folks too. I still remember how It infuriated me to no end to see our guild disenchanting minor upgrades for people who'd rather pass on those in order to preserve DKP for some big ticket item.
---
Yes and the rabble do well to remember that I am a master of the arcane, not some free for all vending machine for the masses.
---
This actually made me chuckle, thanks :)
---
Something something Chuck Norris
---
Some overall points;
---
-Make sure you have a solid loot system set in stone, regardless if you're going casual or hardcore. Loot drama is the worst there is (I'm not trying to instill fear).
---
-Focus on having a very dedicated main tank, raid leader and/or at least a handful of healers. Having these spots fixed to dedicated players early will make the guild much more solid in the long run, rather than switching them every other week.
---
-Have structure! No matter how simple or complicated. It is very important to have structure in the guild when dealing with 40, 50 or even more players. Think about raid days/times, recruitment, guild rankings, discord, raid sign-ups etc.
---
-Make it clear what goal you have in mind for the guild. Doing so will help 'filter' quite some people, because not everyone fits in every guild. You don't want to promise hardcore players things when you bring 15 'meta specs' to a raid. It sets the tone for the guild as well.
---
Overall it depends really what kind of guild you're making. There are a lot of ways to create and manage a guild and these points are just my opinion.
---
The only note I'm expecting from my wife is a set of divorce papers.
---
Awesome ! The wood and chains are also foam ? Excellent job !
---
Blizzards confirmed that selling runs for gold is ok, all ya gotta do is say he told me he would pay me on an alt and he did
---
If it bleeds, you can kill it.
---
I dunno, Feral tanks are kind of a meme at this point, since they were looked down upon in most, if not all of, Vanilla; and only recently found a place as the value of threat &gt; defense became meta in private servers.
---
Though, with how wonky the pserver numbers look now that we have a legit blizz client, we shall have to see if this premise still holds true.
---
Oh boi my body is ready
---
Yep! All foam!
---
:3
---
As a mage I will respectfully decline being chopped to pieces and will instead turn you into a target practice popsticle.
---
I'm talking about lying and letting liar prosper. If Blizzard cant tell the difference... but go on and keep supporting gold buying.
---
i never ran into that issue, but tanks can miss shield slam, and other threat generating abilities. either way your DPS can keep it in their pants for 10 more seconds and youll have a good attempt. 
---
All things equal though, A bear tank can pump threat harder than a warrior. I wouldnt use a bear in every fight but there are some they excel at
---
Another gazelle made it to respawn!
---
Very cool man !
---
not at all, it's clear by blizzards lack of effort this is a scam

About Us: &lt;No Bedtime&gt; is a guild created with the mindset of completing all content WoW Classic has to offer in a competitive time table. The goal in mind for the guild was to harbor all different players from Casual to Hardcore Raiding, to create a mature community that you would want to be a part of and meet new people with similar goals and aspirations. Having a casual player base creates a healthy balance to keep the spirits high and everyone grounded. Ideally the goal is to shoot for top 5-10 in terms of PvE progression on the realm of choice. We will be rolling on a non-streamer realm to avoid the plague of immaturity that many of their followers bring.
---
Experience : Personally I've cleared and been a RL for all content until Naxx (AQ 9/9) playing across three different roles. This experience was in the Pserver scene but has provided valuable feedback for progressing forward into Classic. At the same time I was acting as the second in command, where this time I would be acting as GM. Playing on NA ping, and acting as a GM will be a new journey that I'm excited for!
---
Expectations / Closing Statements : If you are looking to join, then I expect you know how to conduct yourself among other humans with a sense of morality and maturity. We are looking for people who are enjoyable to be around but who also have a goal they would want to achieve. There are different ranks among the guild of which you can find your fit intermittently for the time being or a more cemented spot in the Raiding Roster.
---
If you are interested in joining then you contact me via Discord and/or fill out a guild application or catch me in game; if you are interested in being a pivotal part of our success and joining the officiating ranks of (Class Leader / Council Member) also message me via Discord.

---
ok so going from INSANE threat to Better than the other tanks is still a good improvement.
---
some off specs are better than others. e.g. holy palas don't really need much more than Illumination unless you're really pushing the edge on progression--deep holy mostly sucks--so hybrid specs like 19/32 or 19/8/23 etc. are pretty nice. just tell your raid leader you're holy :)
---
Very nice! But... For the Horde!
---
&gt; I plan on being an orc warlock destruction specialization because of the 5% pet damage buff,which means max dps vs every other class correct ?
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I don’t wanna play what I want , I wanna play the **best DPS race** for that class
---
If you're DPSing as a warlock, you don't have a pet. No horde racials really benefit the class for DPS. Pick whatever.
---
Im against gold selling but blizzard seriously doesnt give a shit. Theyre not gunna lose your $15 over a little gold
---
Mana igniting chord is better than sash of whispered secrets for warlocks. 1% crit is roughly equal to 10-15 spell damage depending on how much crit you already have. I would always give tear of neltharion to warlocks before mages because mage get hit rating from talents where a lock has very little access to hit pre-ZG.
---
A lot of priests end up dropping tailoring once they get their truefaith so don't worry about that.
---
The T2 chest piece is worse than the truefaith vestments. You'll still want to collect full T2 for specific bosses (such as Vicidicus in AQ40, Sapphiron and Loatheb in Naxx) though.
---
Your next upgrade will be [Robes of the guardian saint](https://classicdb.ch/?item=21663) which drops in AQ40, but they'll most likely prio priests last since truefaith is nearly as good.
---
It's such an unproductive comment but I've been laughing like a hyena for minutes
---
Occam’s razor would have saved you 400 words.
---
I don't think it will have any effect at all.
---
What I'm much more interested in however, and what I believe the real question should be, is how might it potentially affect the MMORPG genre if it's seen there's in actuality a massive demand for less streamlined MMOs but very little supply?
---
My man
---
That's not really needed at all. As long as you don't dick up and spend the 60 energy before your tick up to 80 it doesn't matter if you shift 'early'.
---
I am pretty sure the before picture is after a serious poop attack, and not spiders.
---
lmfao Just music &gt;.&lt;
---
Thanks! ^^^FOR ^^^ THE ^^^ALLIANCE
---
Well, see, I'm single, no kids, I work 40 hours a week, morning ops at my store, and have 0 friends, just people who "like" things on my FB. Think I'll find plenty of time.
---
Being shspeshifted into an animal turns you from humanoid to beast. So no.
---
Shaman has frost shock (with slow), flame shock (some dot plus up front), and earth shock (stop target casting) as instant cast options.  Lightning shield sorta counts, but not really.
---
This is why all should agree on "anything that isn´t bop = all need" before a run.
---
so you ban the troll race too? coz they are all fucking racist according to the intro.
---
It's now 5:1 Horde/Alliance.
---
This is what is known as non-constructive criticism. If you want to contribute to the discussion (constructive criticism) point out the information that should be fixed, so that the community as a whole can benefit from potential changes.
---
I thought i fixed it... dunno why the volume went back up on the music. Will fix and repost
---
If you keep casting you still gain threat, it just comes back when the pot ends. Not a dump, just an ohshit button so you can stand there like a dumbass.
---
Definitely looks like it! You don't want to see what scary nonsense was UNDER the keys. I took apart the entire frame and soaked the whole thing in bleach and had a priest bless it with holy water
---
Pserver player crying about leeway and then being proved to have played with it all along since vanilla and now on pservers is the best thing I've seen this year.
---
Because vanilla had the same system.
---
Yeah, a warrior tank can miss other threat generating abilities which druids can't because they have no other threat generating abilities, that's kind of the point. If you miss Maul all you have is Swipe, which is about as useful as sneezing at the boss in terms of TPS, or Faerie Fire. Because 90% of Druid threat is a direct result of Maul use, having Mauls avoided is unbearable.
---
Legendary artifact!

I'm sorry Bobby B I didn't mean to.

BACKSTABBING DOESN'T PREPARE YOU FOR A FIGHT!
---
The overwhelming ‘min-max anxiety’ about the launch of Classic is pretty disconcerting.  Being a generally unaware person, I’d blame the streaming phenomenon for this.  Due to the fact that millions (?) of people are watching ‘professional’ gamers min-max the fuck out of any and every game, the berating anyone who does differently, and the social media effect of that behavior then being normalized amongst the audience.
---
Unpopular opinion:  I’m going to pick a race and class that I want to play, and I’m going to have fun playing the game.
---
I love how the rage mechanic sort of encourages you to do stupid berzerker stuff, like pulling a little aggro (or extra mobs or whatever) so that you can get extra rage from damage taken, so you can do more damage...perfect for the class.
---
Drink the water you soaked it in to absorb your former self powers.
---
That is what I meant indeed, probably not the most clear sentence.
---
The fact that you left the penny makes me happier than it probably should.
---
Please tell me you’re not going to use this

Warriors are cool because I can tank.
---
Then you haven’t read any of his other comments. This is nothing for what he normally spouts.
---
The engine is the technological framework for a video game. What you describe as crunch runs on top of it.
---
Just a terminology problem I guess. I wouldn't argue against BC's mechanics being the game's peak though.
---
I tried restoring my old Razer Naga Molten edition as well, but unfortunately small bits of plastic had broken off inside and it was rendered irreparable
---
Awesome! I’ll check it out
---
Useful to know this stuff so when your loot council is trying to dick you over you can call them out
---
I could understand that, but could you inform me on the differences would face if the tank was Warr/Bear?
---
It’s not at all intuitive that shifting every third global while using one specific talent and one helmet with a unique ability is how you are intended to properly pay the class. So, you are totally off base when you are comparing it to applying corruption or curse of agony. 
---
In all likelihood, power shifting is an unintended  mechanic that blizz has thus  far left in.  
---
Hope that helps.
---
Heigan's dance is not an example of leeway, but is an example of why leeway was implemented. The servers are constantly trying to determine where all of the players are in 3D space, based on constant data being sent with at least some delay. In some cases, particularly in PvE, the servers will favor their data over what the player sees on their screen (which happens slightly before their actions reach the server). So what happens is that while your client had your character 1yard out of the slime explosion, the server hadn't gotten that update, but had no delay in knowing when the explosion happened. 
---
In PvP though, who do you favor if both clients are doing things slightly before the server get's that data? So they give "leeway" to account for the fact that I may appear to be 1 yard away from my target, but on their screen they are 5 yards away, and the server is working to reconcile that difference on thy fly. When I was lagging pretty badly, I wouldn't see leeway, because my client would be so far behind that even though I thought my target was 1 yard away, they might actually be 15 yards away, and both their client and the server already knew that because I was the only one lagging. So I would not be able to attack in that situation. Yet when I wasn't lagging I could clearly see where the game was accounting for situations where I might charge, but land a few yards behind my target.

Repair.

If you check your battle.net app, in the dropdown menu directly above the "play" button for WoW, you'll see an option for Retail PTR(WoW's Public Test Realm) and WoW: Classic. If you select WoW Classic, the Play button will become an Install button. That is how we've swapped between versions of WoW for a while. Specifically Different accounts, PTR, and now Classic.

Play a rogue to avoid ganks. Alternatively, being a Nightelf lets you afk without worry thanks to shadowmeld. Just meld in a low traffic area and you're probably fine.
---
And in a good guild the crossbow wouldn't go to a rogue first.
---
The corehound tooth and brutality blade are both great stats for a hunter. Priority should go to someone who uses those as weapons since the overall raid dps will go up for the same reason the crossbow should go to the hunter, but that doesn't mean there isn't legitimate competing interest.
---
My first 60 in vanilla was a warrior too, stepping into BGs in greens turned me off WoW PvP for years lol. It's pretty rough.
---
Yeah once people realised they could trade a better experience for fake internet points it was all ovrr
---
I don't want to ban anything. Go hog wild on roleplaying that orcs are scum and collect dwarf beards all you want as long as it's in the Warcraft universe and in the spirit of the game. Players couldn't keep it in their pants and kept making racist jokes with the item in chat so Blizzard had to change the items name. You're intentionally missing the point however so I'm not sure why I'm bothering.
---
Then why are you such a killjoy?
---
Literally one shotting someone by being lucky once in a while. I'm a simple man
---
&gt;However they have more health and armor meaning they can take bigger hits (crit/crush) with less worry.
---
Yeah, let's forget the poor bastard who has to heal through it.
---
It's not troll.  Playing a hunter vs a highly skilled warrior, mage, rogue takes more skill to win then most other classes.
---
Playing a hunter against your average scrub... Is free fodder.
---
But we're talking about skill ceilings here not playing against scout level players.
---
I believe you will be prompted to download a classic version of WoW on launch but it will probably only be a few gigs in size if you already have retail installed.
---
Doesnt the fact that "I can see how specs such as boomkin could be considered a “meme” class"
---
Answer your own question?
---
Im waiting since the shutdown of Nostalrius. Since mars 2016. Oh shit.
---
My dude it's hard to tell what the fuck is happening because the editing is schizophrenic. Like most of the fights he skipped more of the fight than he showed in order to line it up with the music. That shit's arguably worse than the satirical editing from the dummy rogue character in World of Roguecraft.
---
Like how am I supposed to give a shit about any fight in the video if I can't see his cooldowns and I don't know what abilities have been recently used (without parsing some information from his diminishing return tracker which fk that).
---
There's more to the game than reflecting hunter traps, skull of impending doom and cold blood crits. I need to be able to see all the other shit too. Especially when we're talking about the class whose abilities are gated by a 1/10 resource per second rule instead of cooldowns like most of the other classes. Like that dynamic really makes seeing at least most of a fight really important.
---
Was watching 2 btw, if you promise me the others aren't as horrendous I'll give them a go.
---
Can some one please make a guild of meme specs and pwn?
---
There is half horde half alliance flair for those of you!
---
Because private server flawed information told them so.
---
Or exceptionally overgeared guilds killing the boss before the mana inefficiency of a Druid tank drags them into a wipe.
---
No.
---
Eh. You never just actively wear the engi helmets as your main item, you swap it in and use it and then swap it out. Since T2 is generally pretty bad for mages, it's also not *that* hard to get all the pieces. But odds are that you'll be missing the last one for x months which is why it's not worth aiming for the full set at the expense of, say, ranking up. I don't think you can say that it isn't good because you need all the pieces. That's like saying Sulfuras isn't good because it's so much effort to get it.
---
Just buy an alcor's sun razor will last you til tfury
---
What if they state at the start that they are only here for x item. There's no surprises and you know from the get go that they won't be rolling on anything else. 
---
People always complain about people wasting their time in this game.  That person would probably choose not to come if they knew someone was going to roll against them.
---
Now if they didn't mention it at all until just before or after it drops that's their problem but if they state it at the start and you say nothing or say you won't roll against them and then do that's really poor form and you're wasting their time for your benefit.
---
Exactly
---
Tank group often doesnt have a bunch of dps in it, you'll usually have 
---
Tank, OT, Warlock, shaman, _____. 
---
That group could easily be Bear, Warrior, Warlock, Shaman, Hunter and put agi down.
---
But it does, because the reason boomkin is a "meme" spec is because its shit, and thats the same for ret.
---
Ah yes quite
---
I wish I actually had friends in the game ☹️
---
Well, yes, Sulfuras isn't great, there are better weapons out there, just like there are offpieces that are much better than the mage T2
---
All of us cringy dads who act like we're children to our wife-moms are the ones who will be still playing wow in a year. All you tryhard fucks who are not getting nostalgia boners are gonna get bored and quit after Christmas. Also, in our defense of bring cringy dad-children, if you knew what kind of beast your wife turns into when she gets 3 hours of sleep per night for a whole year, you'd be afraid of her too. Begging for time off to play video games.
---
It gets edged out by 1-2% in spreadsheets by Bloodvine. Still gives you waaaaaay more survivability though. Worth it in higher tier raids.
---
I’ve been researching and what you’re saying is just false. If  I’m not mistaken Patchwork even favors feral over prot because threat is favored. Bears do generate more threat, which is not widely known (I’ve just learnt this myself). 
---
I’ll like to a YouTube vid backing me up, because im lazy  
---
https://youtu.be/mNGo5SMeqgo
---
&gt; Why are you rolling on a PvP server 'with friends' but mostly soloing to 60?
---
&gt; Where are said friends in all of this?
---
I'll be raiding with my friends, not leveling. They're too slow.
---
Lol maybe in casual guilds.
---
I'm leaning towards lock but T3 looks awful IMO.
---
No offense, but if you’re playing arms warrior with the knowledge that you’re pushing off more important rebuffs you’re probably in fact having a negative impact on dps. Meaning if you push off curse of elements, the raid as a whole probably does MORE damage if you literally did nothing instead of push that debuff off. 
---
Not knowing about it and doing it is one thing, but knowing about it and still doing it is doing something willfully against the benefit of the group as a whole.
---
Belt/Chest/Bracer T2 with PvP helm/shoulders/boots.
---
Say no more fam. 
---
I’ll keep you posted with details.
---
They are good for skilling up skinning if you didn't do it enough in Durotar.
---
Farm uc exalted rep for your spookie boo mount and drink noggenfoggers to be Mr skeletal.
---
Bam, undead shaman.
---
It is a bit strange for somone able to play 1hr every other day to ask whether they can keep up with hardcore players...
---
It would be difficult to raid in that situation and so should be resigned to enjoying what they can amd not worry about that stuff...is why retail went down hill trying to accommodate people like this.
---
There will be a dip in retail logins from newly reactivated accounts. 
---
Accounts with &gt;3 mos continued subs will probably spend less time on retail outside of raid nights for at least a couple of weeks...maybe longer...but this is why they have timed the raid tiers they way they have..keep raiders on the hook.
---
The real question is what will classic do to p.servers?
---
&gt; And what does this “buff” do vs having your pet alive and assisting on DPS ?
---
The buff does MORE damage.
---
if your raid is good enough that you're aoe-blasting through the trash pulls, the MT won't really be expected to maintain aggro on everything because the trash will be getting nuked down so quickly that threat won't matter much. if your raid isn't able to nuke things down that quickly, then it shouldn't be aoe'ing all the trash pulls, so your aoe threat won't really matter either.
---
basically what I'm saying is don't worry about it. certainly don't wear obsolete blues just for a small amount of aoe threat.
---
Cool
---
In that case, do you know if its possible to delete retail once you have downloaded classic and know you wont touch it? ... got limited space as well and Retail is taking up most of it right now..
---
There was a thread on here a week-ish or so ago that talked about debuff priority, and I can't remember where MS fell on that list.  If it is medium or higher priority, then yeah, Arms is definitely a no-go.
---
Money.  
---
Hassle.   
---
Large amounts of resources, time and trouble dedicated to a very small (but vocal) fraction of the player base.
---
Meme Specs: 
---
* Ret Paladin

* Prot Paladin

* Balance Druid
---
* Feral Druid
---
* Enhance Shaman
---
* Ele Shaman
---
* Shadow Priest
---
* Beast Mastery Hunter
---
* Marksmanship Hunter
---
* Survival Hunter

As you can see, there's only one true meme class.

the first pic is what my keyboard will look like when im doing my time efficient pro gamer 24/7 playing for 4 days and forget where i placed my poop bucket
---
Play an alchemist race while using a gnome class and take the mage profession.
---
I don’t see why anyone would want the new models except on the female dwarfs
---
Herbalism passive was added (I believe) in wotlk.
---
I love this! If you ever make a horde one to sell hit me up.
---
I did it during BC.  As someone else already pointed out, it had apparently been nerfed before I did, which I was unaware of.
---
Ok but should I roll on a RP-PvP server or buy a Toyota?
---
No worries my dude, happy to help in any way I can since I'm also in the middle of trying to decide what to play once Classic starts rollin'.
---
frost mage in premades and druids as flag carriers are extremely high skill cap
---
Where would you find the download classic option?
---
Druids just became OP in TBC.  They're fantastic pvp class in Vanilla it's just you'll be extremely hard pressed to find a player who is utilizing their kit to it's fullest.
---
Where in TBC you barely have to use more than cat form to win fights.
---
Some would say have etiquette and decency.
---
Some would say FOR THE ORE!
---
What works for you works for you. Then you just have to live with it. I knew I was not good with kids and my wife wholeheartedly agrees I am not. I am very good at protecting them from harm and I am the ones who takes the brunt of everything physical we do. I play with them when we are swimming and diving and in water worlds. I play soccer with them. I chase them pretending to be a monster. But I don’t handle the daily mundane stuff. I have never been good at non action stuff and it’s not gonna change with kids. I am not using it as an excuse. I am 100% honest when I say that I will absolutely refuse to do 50-50% kids chore with my wife. Out of the question. My ex wife wanted 50-50 with my oldest son. I walked away and it feels fantastic that I did.
---
Re-rendering with correct audio levels... should be fixed now. Thanks everyone for the heads up right away about the issues
---
RP has more GM tickets per capita than normal servers.   
---
PVP has more GM tickets per capita than normal servers.   
---
RPPVP is all that added together.
---
If someone says "hey, I'm making a sandwich, pass me a couple slices of bread will ya?" and you give them 3 or more slices of bread. They're going to make their sandwich with two of them and then slap your fucking face with the rest.
---
This says a whole lot about me, I played a huntard as my main from BC up until I quit in Mists
---
From the Blizzard launcher right now you have the option to install Classic. You can even launch it right now to that old iconic login screen from vanilla. You just can't login or do anything yet.
---
honestly you are better off with going 1440p and 144 hz than 4k and 60 hz.
---
Ouuu I would buy one these. Amazing work!
---
You asked, are you not happy with the answer?
---
Ret is low damage and gives no benefit to the raid, they take share gear with warriors, who acctually do damage, so if you give a weapon to a ret instead of a warr the raid deals less damage.
---
I was Co-RL in a classic guild that did two wings of naxx. My responsibilities were to organize the healers and tanks. It helps to give everybody a job to do (who to heal what to tank) with at least one level of contingency. So if you have two heals on DPS and one heal dies then let a third healer (off-tank healer for example) know to watch the DPS dudes. After that it was usually a wipe or a reset. 
---
But just make sure everybody knows their job and what else to cover if something goes awry.
---
I played on PVP servers until mid-wotlk, and I'll be going PVE this time because sometimes I'm just not in the mood for paranoia.  That said, I know I'm going to be missing out on a lot of what makes the game great.  If you're dead set on playing with your friends, my advice is to give PVP life an honest chance.  Screw around on private servers if you need to, and find a class and playstyle that doesn't make you feel helpless in PVP.  
---
You cannot just run and hide from everyone all the time, and you won't have fun trying to.  It's not that hard to be kind of okay in combat with other players.  You just have to get past that flustered panic stage and gain a little confidence.  PVP servers can be really stressful and that's not what I'm always looking for, but I have to admit that what really made Warcraft special for me in the first few xpacs were the scary world PVP situations I'd find myself in and actually feeling like I was waging war alongside my brothers in arms.  
---
TL:DR:  Embrace it or have a bad time.
---
Do your lady go outside to take a piss? Where i live we have something called toilets and they are usually indoors.
---
Mortal strike falls into the top level of debuffs. As a general rule, procs like deep wounds or the fireball dot, things that are a byproduct of another action or ability, are low priority and get pushed off. Things like the curses, sunder armor, mortal strike, which are cast for the purpose of the debuff, tend to be high priority.
---
Thunderfury debuffs seem to be one of the exceptions to this rule
---

someone linked this the other day, which I hadn't seen before: [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12628/demon-forged-breastplate](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12628/demon-forged-breastplate)
---
That’s an answer I can live with.
---
I meant instants for healing.  While those instants are useful, they won't prevent you from getting shut down trying to heal your friends.
---
I actually met one of these in the wild on a pserver last night. Me and a buddy were trying to do our first Uldaman run, a little low level and he came into our party as level 50+. rather than letting me (tank) set a pace I was comfortable with, he stormed rolled around pulling everything as fast fast as possible and screaming "Pepega" "omegalol" and "Mongo Tank" when he thought we were moving too slowly.
---
We wiped after the 3rd boss because they resisted my taunt trying to get something off of our healer and he insta quit the party. I'm so glad these guys will be 90% contained on the NZ servers.
---
incorrect, threat output is a thing and bears excel in it, especially in later content when dps get decked out warriors struggle with threat
---
20% more mana spent?
---
30% faster kill?
---
10% healers mana saved?
---
There you go, bear is mana efficient for you
---
Sure, sure
---
But I have to scroll.. QQ
---
Just like the stat squishes, a level squish is entirely cosmetic. It does nothing for gameplay.
---
thx m8
---
Tired leveling a war on a pserver to get the feel back for classic. I'd say 200 deaths easy at level 34
---
God I can't wait
---
Im not sure what you mean by this. I am by no means hardcore, and I would probably not hit 60 before atleast 3 months has passed.
---
It's so bad in comparison to r/hearthstonecirclejerk it's insane, probably why it has a tenth of the subs too
---
haha i'll bite. 8/8 wailing caverns exp player askyl coming in hot 
---
first, leeway massively buffs my class. second, we knew leeway existed, just internet connections &amp; players are vastly superior now in comparison so it's more noticeable/abusable. +there's 400 ms movement batching in classic (not in tbc+) which makes leeway even stronger. and pservers didn't have the above, or autoattack leeway.
---
You can DE anything with just 1 in enchanting. It was changed later on.
---
Huh? If you wanna cheapshot/kidney you can't really do anything for at least like 6 seconds or so. Like if your backstab crits, cool, but otherwise, if you're cold blood spec, you're basically waiting on your five point eviscerate.
---
They got pretty good.. like, stun front load. CC front load. If that's what you mean. Damage 'front load' is pretty much just autos for a sizable amount of time. Obviously there was some exaggeration with the time frames I gave but still, the point is rogues have to wait on combo points and during that time mage's cooldowns are already ticking after having already expended good damage.
---
&gt;Ele shaman, mages, even locks can just turret 1k crits
---
ye, that too, but I was talking about mages specifically because they can put out some pretty absurd burst with instants. Like if you poly, use your cast time, then for whatever reason you can't sit still and wait on cast times after the poly break, they can still expend some burst while running and churning their instants out.
---
Again. Exceptionally geared dps killing the boss faster thanks to bear threat output. Mana efficient
---
Most of these "bad design choices" are actually good ones.
---
Better visuals that doesn't change the actual style of the graphics(just improves, and yes WoD models and all the new graphics are significantly different style) like they have done already I'm completely fine with.
---
Unfortunately no :( I play the youtube maker character, just without the camera.
---
Mages are the epitome of fantasy RPG. Almost all similar games in the genre have a spellcaster/mage/wizard oriented class, and many great stories like LOTR possess an iconic mage. In the scope of WoW, what they lack in armor, they make up for in conveniences (food/water, teleportation), CCs, Oh Shit buttons, etc. Being one of the only classes that can effectively AoE farm 10+ mobs in a single occurrence speaks loudly about their capabilities in the game. 
---
Then you've got fun things like portal roulette or slow fall off a cliff or tall building with your squad in style. 
---
They are the epitome of laser/glass cannon, and have the flashy aesthetics to back it up. The only things that come close to its flashy aesthetics are the Elemental shaman and Warlock, in my opinion.
---
Fuck oath I'd skip that part. Dal Rend's is awful to try to get and not remotely worth the time compared to simply jumping straight into raids if you can.
---
&gt;So what can a Ret-specced Paladin bring that a Rogue/Fury can't? Heals. A well-timed spot heal is massively helpful and noticeable. That emergency LoH on the tank? Boom - raid saved. 
---
Holy paladins can do both of these things, while also contributing lots of healing instead of crap DPS.
---
Gotcha - thanks!
---
Awesome - thank you!
---
Good warriors can generate more than enough threat, and are more mana efficient.
---
How do you intend on exceptionally gearing up the DPS so you can tank with a bear?
---
I can't be the only one who looks at all the one handed weapons with hunters listed on them and thinks that's adorable
---
And things like that
---
And the retail stuff shown, that was just half of it. More importantly, he is demonstrating that even on the private servers, it existed, even using the same character models (tauren male and orc female) in the same spot in ratchet. I think this fact alone honestly helps people get comfortable with it. People want the classic experience, and the only way people were able to do that was through private servers, and the ratchet example helps prove its existence.
---
I remember my neighbor used to sell items by clicking and dragging items (kinda like on the buy back tab) and he complained that he could only sell a certain amount of stuff before the page was full. I had to break the news to him that a simple right click would sell anything he needed... haha
---
I'm guessing all of your information comes from private servers. Good luck with that.
---
Druid.
---
Yeah that’s the big thing with hunters - from T1 to T3 they only gain like 40% stronger than a fresh 60 hunter according to the dps math - but a massive chunk of that 40% comes so early on.
---
&gt;The rest of the editing is just his style but what he's doing is fairly visible, in my opinion.
---
It's not that I can't see what's presented it's that he's skipping like 5s of a fight, 2-3 times per fight. Sometimes more, never less. It's basically like a number presentation with the occasional frost nova dodge or something thrown in (cuts before and after said dodge, ofc).
---
He seems great, in the way he's choosing to play, but to me this seems like to WoW videos what porn is to sex. It's just an unrealistic depiction.
---
There's a lot of cuts in porn too, actually.
---
Many classes have a few quests 10-25 but not many stand out as worth doing, except ones that unlock spells like druid forms or rogue poisons. Paladins [Verigan's Fist](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=1806/the-test-of-righteousness) quest at lvl 20 is probably the only one that really stands out for a nice early weapon.
---
I have a great schedule for work 1 on 3 off, but with a 17 month old ill be playing from 1030 till 12ish about 3-4 days a week is all. Maybe i can play once in a while while he naps. Ill be only pvping and running dungeons so time wont matter as much. I really enjoy the leveling and the pvp so i plan on taking my time and having fun. I love fishing irl, and in wow its slow but relaxing and fun, cant wait to do that again. Snapjaw oasis anyone?
---
He didn't come for discussion and guidance. He came to act cocky and argue with people who are correcting his total gibberish post. Go read some of his other comments in here.
---
I think one assumes competency, the other mastery.
---
But I agree this is a manufactured distinction. A curve can imply mastery I just don’t think this is commonly associated with a learning curve. Otherwise it might be called a mastery curve of an expert curve or similar.
---
I have to disagree with not using imolation / serpent sting but besides that pretty solid list. From a fellow hunter veteran
---
You think hungering cold is the only item here that should ever go to a tank?
---
To me, it's donkey work. Running the same dungeon twice is okay, twenty times is tedious.
---
Plus I think the assumption that you *can* just run Strat over and over again until you get the drop is a pirate server leftover. With 10k people playing at all hours you can get all the runs you like easily enough, but with Blizzlike populations Strat runs won't be arriving every quarter hour like a bus service.
---
I think a lot of people will be heading into MC with blue chests just because they can't realistically farm a purple chest recipe in time.
---
I would seriously be keen to play a druid, but not having a normal res sounds like such a drainer. I know I will be doing loads of dungeons and hate to have to always bring a hybrid class just for ressing.
---
Yes I know that you can always just not have a res during dungeons, but I remember the frustration of random deaths adding shit loads of time to a dungeon in run backs
---
Or,
---
automated name reporting
---
community self policing

no higher resource requirement than an RPPvE server, which will already exist.

Watch this entire video  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PZFUpzpRE8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PZFUpzpRE8)
---
Wow thanks!
---
Fucking bad ass dude... good stuff
---
It's ironic because the only delusional idiot here is you.
---
Yeah I definitely agree. We have ~15 years of data on the classes to know what is good and what isn't, asking Reddit isn't going to yield as strong results as some results as some research on Google.
---
People can feel free to use software like this if they’re willing to risk omen catching them and hitting them with a 6 month ban for botting but I promise you it has happened to people and you’re not going to get the ban overturned lol
---
I've been in a guild where they were dkp and then epgp and it fucking sucked. What I'm getting at is that the system matters less than the culture of the people running it and it's better to know what you're in for. We're talking about things like a hunter not getting Crown of Destruction because another hunter with less dkp wanted it, and being forced to take items which are technically upgrades when you don't want them because they fuck up your epgp score for the items you really want.
---
Regardless of what the beta was like, I'm pretty confident they'll be able to figure out how to get a 15 year old game to be pretty smooth.
---
When I look at parses, I usually see a fury on top, not a rogue.
---
Horde Rogues can't get to +5 swords with seal fate period, it's only possible to get +5 maces because you only need 20 points in combat before getting mace skill instead of 20nfor swords/daggers. If a Seal Fate mace rogue pulled the point out of mace specialization and put it back in seal fate it would be the exact same spec as seal fate swords with the exact same maximum weapon skill.
---
Hunter, Druid, 
---
Shaman, mage
---
Rogue
---
All the rest
---
Imo
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=9492 this can be used before large AOE pulls. Then taken off, the lightning shield buff will stay on. I even used this in BC and Wrath just to add a bit more dmg when getting hit
---
Seinfeld.
---
The big thing that doesn’t get said is that if your raid isn’t pushing a Prot Warrior’s threat cap, swapping out for a Bear is just going to be more healing intensive.
---
I'd like to see Blizzard or another big company make it's own newer MMORPG based on old methods.
---
With Blackjack.
---
And hookers.
---
Is that English? Nice retort. Hope you can abide by ToS come classic or maybe you should just stick to private servers so you can do what you have to do since being edgy may be some sort of compulsion for you. Take care.
---
check out Punished Props and Kamui Cosplay both on youtube. I know this isnt cosplay but Kamui works with foam so basically everything shes showing off can be used in some way.
---
Will you be playing, either primarily or occasionally, as an off-spec for your class? 
---
* Yes, I will be a Feral Offtank 3rd or 4th depending on our OT Warriors luck with gearing.
---
Do off-specs have a place in raiding? 
---
* Yes, but only a few spots.
---
Do off-specs have a place in PVP, solo-leveling, or 5-man dungeons?
---
* 100% yes in all of these. in 5 mans outside of speed clears spec hardly matters.
---
Is Classic flexible in terms of whether or not off-specs can be successful?
---
* Not really, there is a lot of math backing up the fact that most offspecs are not nearly as good as true main specs. But just because Solo it is mathematically not valuable to bring an offspec, doesn't mean as a whole it isn't wise. Bringing a shadow priest to buff warlocks is a net gain for the raid. 
---
Do you have a favorite off-spec?
---
* Feral Druids, they are the least behind overall compared to other offspecs, which is why I picked it over other offspecs. I would then say Shadow priest, they do decent numbers, while buffing others, plus they are monsters in PvP.
---
Are people worrying too much about off-specs, and just need to mind their own/their guild's own business?
---
* No comment
---
Just use dkp and arrive at the same ideal outcomes but with 40 people feeling like active participants over their fate due to have agency and control...
---
i went with a 24, i was a little worried it would be too small but i adjusted and am very comfortable with it now.
---
going from 60hz to 144hz was mind blowing
---
Ok fair enough THC does get any class to +5 swords, but if we're talking about KT loot than literally nothing else before it matters. Gresil and THC is BiS for every melee dps regardless of race. If you're downing KT you're not really worried about itemizing for raid loot efficiency any longer. There's nothing to progress to be efficient for.
---
Nah dood they’re having fun so it’s all good
---
Yeah, generally you'll have tank group and 3 melee groups, maybe a stray rogue will have to be on their own, but then you can also keep a shaman in the main healer group for tranquil air and mana spring, and one for wherever else it may be needed. Horde tend to be heavier on melee than alliance so you may need another wfury.
---
Amulet if the redeemed is 1.10 and sanctified leather helm is 1.11. I’d be shocked if they’re in on launch
---
Yet here we are playing private servers. Still killing kobolds and picking up their shit year after year. :)
---
No because the boomkin can be replaced by a feral doing the same who buffs classes who benefit more from the crit while it does much superior damage.
---
I don't think you quite followed what happened, then. No offense. 
---
&gt;  he includes things like "stop the heals", then the gouge on the priest misses and he's clearly still moving around.
---
When he writes "stop heals" he uses Tidal Charm. It's an instant 3 sec stun from a trinket that has sort of long range. It's the blue water stuff that happens on the priest while the purple stuff shoots from his hands.
---
The priest is already stunned from Tidal Charm when he tries to Gouge him. I guess he wanted to Gouge him to CC the priest for a few seconds longer. 
---
You can actually see that the priest has the debuff icon from the Tidal Charm so he is clearly not moving around. 
---
&gt; then he says "blind shaman" or whatever, then stacks CC on that shaman by reflecting the AoE fear from the priest that he just got done pretending like he had just CC'd.
---
No, that's not exactly what happens. He blinds the shaman, who looks like a skeleton because of Noggenfogger Elixir. You can see the Blind debuff icon on the target frame of the shaman. 
---
After that he pops Shadow Reflector. I guess it's because the 3 sec stun from Tidal Charm is over and wants reflect the instant AoE fear of the priest. 
---
So he actually wasn't "pretending" to CC Shaman. 
---
Then he goes on to kill the Druid who has the flag along with his team mate.
---
Looks amazing. Can you tell me how you made the wood texture? It looks so realistic.
---
As a mage: click the portal to help summon
---
Big issue with that list is a lot of people are posting their names and guild bank names. Names haven't been reserved yet and that's a really easy way to troll those guilds...
---
Thanks for this!
---
The feral could have also not been geared correctly. Things to consider:
---
\- Just like some fights are difficult for warriors, some are very difficult for bears. (A couple of actually almost impossible.) There are actual fights that bear are better than warriors. I'll give you an example: If you finished Naxx and you are using it as an example, did the bears tank the back of the room or the front in the 4HM fight? I ask because bears tanking Mograine is a terrible idea. He has a chance to hit proc for ticking fire damage. If you parry or dodge it, it wont come out. Bears ALWAYS tank the back, if they tank.
---
\- Was the feral at armor cap? 
---
\- Did they use consumables and flasks?
---
\- The feral also could have been specced poorly, or could have been playing poorly as well.
---
Lots of variables here in a single sample size in a blanket statement.
---
I used a brass wire brush to dig in a circle to make the knots, then I just drag the wire brush down the foam in one direction to make the wood grain!
---
Like I said, someone just buys gold and gives it away in town. Now you ban a bunch of innocent people. Can't ban buyers for that reason. Can't ban only the buyer, because they'll buy the gold on a second account and transfer it to their main.
---
Hunter&gt;(Ele)Shaman&gt;Druid&gt;Mage=Rogue&gt;Warlock&gt;Warriors&gt;Priest&gt;Paladin&gt;Spriest
---
..... he said more meme **than** ret pally not feral druid....
---
Ret Paladins should have lower priority on all loot, though. So it’s not really needed to add them. If a caster can use it, should get it first, if a healer, them, if melee dps they should. Rets shouldn’t get gear until that gear would otherwise be sharded.
---
This makes me sad too.  Leveling as a noob made the game feel like an rpg.  Using a weapon cause it looks cool and not stressing out over optimization exemplifies the fun of the game back then (for me).  Learning my talent preference organically made feel close to my character.  By the time I hit 60 as an elemental shaman, I understood my class very well from my own experience.  I built my on pre-BiS set using thottbot to search for spell power gear.  In all likelihood, I was probably fairly off the mark but MC isn't that hard and our guild progressed through to rag fairly quickly.  Even raiding with what's considered a meme spec now, I was competitive on the meters.  A very large part of the player base was bad in todays standards, but I believe that made the game more fun.  I worry about all the private server players making things a little less fun.  Know-it-alls can be a bother.  Best we can do is enjoy the experience for what it is.  IMO, understanding that it's going to be a different experience this time around is important to enjoying Classic.
---
&gt;What steps, if any, will be taken to deal with dying servers?
---
The entire point of layering is to prevent dying servers. They're going to have a tiny amount of servers available, with 50-100k players on each when the game goes live. Even if 80% leave the servers will be more than fine.
---
Feral is not even a meme spec.
---
Any system has its flaw. But you made a point the system will suck if the people suck. We had DKP and worked fine through clearing Naxx. Had to tell a couple druids to fuck off they can't have DFT when they weren't feral or they couldn't take DPS items over melee mains.
---
Yeah it’s gone down hill for Sure. I called a dude out for a cringe post and some newb (not the OP) started harassing me. Clown.
---
the correct etiquette in this situation is to train mobs onto that guy and fuck up his pulls until he gives up and leaves YOUR cave
---
That’s one thing I feel like don’t mention enough. The hybrids have a toolkit and are usually expected to use a ton of consumables to be up to par, but if someone’s is asking about a meme spec how likely are they to do any of that? Are you going to be the full SP Ret or just show up with an Elixir of the Mongoose and not react fast enough to LoH calls? Or be the Boomy that only brings an Arcane Elixir and Superior Mana Pots bits can’t cast Barkskin, Innervate, or Bres? If they can’t do that then they have somehow made their time playing an already meme spec even worse by not even putting in the effort to warrant their spot in the raid with such a spec. If you want to play the spec understand the expectations of you as a player to maximize your hybrid abilities.
---
Maybe I should rephrase my question. What is the most efficient way to hand out Castigator and MSA for raid progression in a Horde guild?
---
That's ultimately the question I'm trying to answer and a nerfed Seal Fate spec, seemed like a possible solution to me.
---
Actually really good post, but the "Hunters are quite OP" Part is a yikes. I'll pretend I didn't see that.
---
I'm a late wotlk/cata baby. I started in the september before cata came out and I was 12. I was torn between making a night elf druid to turn into animals or a blood elf hunter to tame animals. I settled on the hunter (later made a nelf druid too). I remember I remade her 3 times because I kept losing my pet. *Facepalm* I still have that hunter but I only use her for old world farming and achievements. I'm a healer main. I mained that druid all of legion but put her aside for a priest in BFA.
---
I remember the most frustrating thing I ran into early on was that I couldn't figure out how to get out of the blood elf starting zones.  I found the teleport orb early but tirisfal was scary so I went back and forgot it was there.  I did every quest in eversong and ghostlands and tried to corpse walk through the plaguelands before I remembered the tp orb.
---
All correct but feral druid. Feral tank is BIS for a few bosses and equal to fury for OT.
---
&gt; It's amazing that a video game can get people to second guess their decisions so many times. 
---
Right? that's because your choices in wow Matter; they have *Consequences*
---
That means you can make good decisions, or bad ones, and they will affect you for a long time.
---
Which segues perfectly in to....
---
&gt;play whatever you want however you want to play it. Classic WoW allows every single person to play however they want and have fun while doing it. Don't feel ashamed of your decisions and don't let anyone else's decisions make you feel bad about yours.
---
You have two groups on this forum, both are yelling half the truth at each other.
---
Yes, if you want to play a ret pally, do it.  
---
You can have loads of fun if that's your thing. T
---
This can be the right choice for you!
---
At the same time however: No. No one will be out looking for a ret pally for their raid. 
---
Ever.
---
 They might accept one for many reasons from just flat not caring, to thinking you are such an awesome guy they can overlook your build. But if raiding is your goal, then there *are* good choices, and bad choices just like anything else.
---
These things can be, and are, true at the same time.
---
No build is "bad' but some ARE quite emphatically bad *at* specific things.
---
Your decisions mater, make smart choices based on your personal goals.

**Loot System:**  Loot List / Loot Council. Brief explanation- All guild members will create a small list of items they want from each raid, rating each  item   as they wish (This is a one time list, created before the first guild raid). A master list will be created and sorted by each  individual's rating multiplied by their attendance %. Each time an  item drops, the member at the top of the list will be asked if they  want the item. If an item drops and the list is empty, it will be distributed via the Loot Council. Direct Message me for more details.
---
**Raid Times:**  Monday, Wednesday 7-10 CST PM. The raid will stop at 10:30, guaranteed. The first official guild raid will be scheduled in late October or early November to give our members \~2 months to reach level 60.
---
**About Us:** Casual/Semi-Hardcore is subjective, so let me break it down for you.
---
* We  are a new guild (30 members) that is focused on PvE progression. PvP is  welcome and encouraged, but the guild's priority will be raiding. Age doesn't matter, as long as you act like a    mature adult. 
---
* If  you are a working adult or a student that wants to continue to focus on  your schooling, we may be the guild for you. We will not be pushing for  server firsts, demanding quick leveling times, or requiring      attendance/consumables.
---
* We are only raiding two nights a week, so the raid will be built for the best chance of success. Attendance/BiS Gear/Consumables may not be required, but they will be considered when building the raid and  distributing loot.
---
**What We Provide:**
---
* Experienced leadership. Our raid leaders cleared MC/BWL/ZG/AQ40/Naxx (Up to 4 Horsemen) before TBC released.
---
* A  relaxed and mature environment. Jokes, memes, and rippin' on each other in good faith are fair game. Racism and the like will not be  tolerated.
---
* Guild first mentality. There will be a lot of dungeon grinding and quest help
---
* Our discord will be full of pinned messages with resources for leveling, dungeons, raiding, professions, add-ons, etc..
---
**What We Expect From You:**
---
* Mature attitude. Be willing to help others without being condescending. Be willing to receive criticism so you can learn and make the guild stronger.
---
* Attuned by first guild raid.
---
* Discord  - you are not required to be vocal, but it is expected that you are listening to the raid leaders and responding if necessary.
---
* When it is raid night, we expect you to be there on time, with the proper PvE spec, knowledge of the fights, and a mature attitude.
---
* Loot isn't your first priority. Loot comes slowly in classic, the success of the guild will provide loot for everyone.
---
**Class needs:**
---
Druid (Resto) - Medium
---
Hunter - Medium
---
Mage - Very low
---
Priest - Medium/Low
---
Paladin (Holy) - Medium
---
Rogue - Medium
---
Warlock - Medium/Low
---
Warrior (Fury) - Medium/High
---
Warrior (Offtank/DPS) - Low

MC and BWL lists are all around the place.
---
Band of Accuria: Always tank prio
---
Quick strike ring: Hunters? Jesus christ. Bis for warriors until 
---
naxxramas.
---
Aged core leather gloves: Best gloves for dagger warrior, which is one of the strongest warrior specs in aq40.
---
Onyxia tooth pendant: Warriors replace in naxx, 2h warriors on horde possibly much earlier.
---
Striker's Mark: Warriors replace in aq40 (shotgun)
---
Master dragonslayer ring: Mediocre for warriors unless in very dire need of hit. Plenty of better or at least very comparable options.
---
Maladath and CTS: Depends on faction. On horde prio should go to rogues.
---
Another buff, more damage and BoF for the best dps. 
---
Still less meme
---
Perfect explanation!!
---
I want to level prot but everyone acts like it's impossible. I think they just have ADHD.
---
Squash it at every turn. Face forward. Hear something through the grapevine that so and so has a problem? Go ask them. Here about a problem between 2 people? Pull them both into a chat. Someone being a dick beyond normal amusement? Kick them.   
---
You can't control it all. But the more you nip in the bud right at the beginning the better your life will be.
---
Hopefully the audio is fixed!!! Sorry about the first post
---
I always play with game music on. It's critical for the atmosphere, in my view. In particular the desert/Ahn' Quiraji music is very atmospheric.
---
They are all fake.
---
What? Way back in Warcraft 3...?
---
I humbly bow to the correctness of this fuller explanation.  Yeah, shaman heals have less versatility than priest heals.  Although, they are not completely without a toolbox themselves, which is all I sought to clarify.
---
Completely agree with this.  If I even decide to play classic when it’s released, I wont be able to spend anywhere close to the time I spent during the original.  It’s just not possible.  So I’m going to make sure I don’t waste time and am as efficient as possible, while still enjoying the more laid back gameplay that classic brings.
---
shadow reflect trinket forsure, as for the rest i wouldnt worry about it
---
Having to farm weapons out of a low-level dungeon for hours every single week makes it a meme spec. The fact that people make memes about it makes it a meme spec.
---
You sure you want classic?
---
Also that pool will spread almost evenly on like 10 million different changes, guess what happens if Blizzard tries to make everyone happy.
---
Transmog.... your opinion isn't unpopular, it's simply stupid.
---
Typical "my change is fine" thread.
---
Not sure on horde quests for priests. But i would advise looking up wands and see if thee is a horde associated quest for them
---
I don't think worrying about horde raiding viability is warranted.  Its a slight edge to alliance in raiding.  The vast majority of players wh0 prefer horde wont be persuaded to jump to alliance for that slight edge
---
general rule of thumb for downranking spells is to use the lowest rank with the same cast time.  Once you drop to a lower rank spell with a shorter cast time the efficiency starts to fall off
---
Robes of the exalted from undead strat are a solid replacement for truefaith.  For many players the difference wont be worth the grind
---
renew is generally not very good in most raiding situations just because of efficiency.  It still has its place in dungeons and smaller group play.  Its fine for topping of a dps or using on a tank after initial aggro unless you are struggling with mana or if you really need to cast something on the run.  If you're not struggling with mana then renew is fine.
---
You're talent build is perfectly fine
---

You probably shouldn't go to England anymore...
---
I posted it here because I couldn't find the Monday recruiting thread, thank you! I'll remove it and repost there
---
Interesting! I knew there was some non-ds spec that was also played occasionally but I never knew about this discussion. Thanks, that's pretty neat!
---
I think another problem could be that the "cringe" posters and those who enjoy them also participate more frivilously in upvoting. I think those kinds of posts are much more likely to get a quick passing updoot by someone currently occupying a shitter than a post trying to start some heavy debate. I think you're right those of us looking for more "serious" content should try being a little more generous with the upvoting on content.
---
Interesting...
---
So you are against gold selling yet defending gold buyers?
---
Yeah the males have a bigger hitbox below the waist and females have a bigger hitbox above the waist.
---
Since you're rolling alliance....Undead Rogues are not your friend. You will come to loathe them. They will eat your corpse. They will laugh at you. Such is the way of things.
---
It was a “hunter weapon” joke bruh
---
I was thinking of something similar. Tailoring and enchanting on whatever clothie I ultimately decide to play. Collect cloth just by doing quests and dungeons, use cloth to level tailoring, then shard what I make with tailoring to level enchanting.
---
Yeah that’s what I meant, sry
---
I read some lore that casting a fel ability creates a feeling of raw europhoria.
---
Im not defending them, blizzard is lol. I would ban anyone buying gold, blizzard doesnt for the “reason” stated above
---
Sorry it’s hard to tell classic community is toxic as fuck sometimes
---
Can you inspect a player and see their talent trees like you can see their honor page?
---
Ya it’s definitely a very unnerving possibility that this sort of experiment could turn out bad and producing an experience that isn’t really that great. The vanilla wow gameplay wasn’t all that good. It was the fact that the game was a glorified vr chat room that made it amazing.
---
Blackcrow is better than strikers, SM is way to fast for a hunter to want
---
Glad we are on the same page. :)   A great hybrid is truly a useful thing. 
---
(I cleared Naxx as a rogue in retail, and a priest up to Onyxia.)
---
I like to think of hybrid classes in a completely different role than "spec". You dont play a "DPS spec" in vanilla. You play your class.
---
r/UnexpectedFrank
---
I'm sorry it looks like there was some effort in this, but I feel like it's misleading.  A moonkin and feral aren't worth bringing for a minor crit buff.  A ret isn't worth bringing to heal in some weird chance that they need to heal because no other healers are paying attention.
---
If you want to play those classes because you think they will be fun, great!  It's a game do what you want.  But people should be aware of the FACT that the non healing specs for healing classes weren't that good.  If you don't want to raid then it's no problem.  But no point in leveling to 60 and finding out nobody wants to take a DPS druid along.
---
Did you not watch the video?  It quite literally documents that auto attack leeway exists on pservers almost identically to how it exists in Classic.
---
Something comforting knowing that people are relying on you to make the moves and you are a plate covered meat shield that hits HARD.
---
The biggest thing that I would be concerned about is if u wanna raid and the 40 man parties will probably overwhelm the cpu in the lilguy
---
Sorry you didn't make it to the stress-test-soulmate-a-thon, bro/broette.
---
That's not what classifies a meme spec. See Minkelz comment here, he explains it perfectly. Also what you described is for kitty feral not bear.
---
People saying it's better then T2 are retarded. Sure it has a few extra healing but t2 gives you a shit ton of int and spirit which helps you last in longer fights... Sure if you're guilds geared as fuck and takes shit down fast it's better, KIND OF. When it comes to "BiS" gear raiding, its situational. You aren't going to run [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Shard\_of\_the\_Scale](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Shard_of_the_Scale) for fights like vael or bosses that get downed fast. But on longer fights like Nef, It's nice to have that extra mana regen for sustain.
---
pretty much.  Ret dps is just kinda low—you can probably make it work if ur not in a hardcore guild but you are gonna spend a shitload in consumables just to even be top 20 in dps.
---
Deep holy gives 5% spell crit which is massive for holy paladins.  I would be pissed about holy paladins rolling on shit like mageblade when they can't be arsed to spend 5 talent points for 5% crit.
---
No. Overpower has a 5 sec cooldown. You're going to dodge often enough as a Rogue that you're eating Overpower on cooldown regardless. It's better to have that chance to dodge an attack that isn't Overpower.
---
I think this is the first bit of advertising theyve actually done.
---
Its anyway, not anyways. Jesus
---
You do realise his case was to understand you and the response he got was: 
---
&gt; Then answer the question about the class post and ignore my humor if it doesn’t preference yours.
---
In any case /u/asc__ got you the information you where looking for. Unfortunately warlocks imp do fire dmg and wont be usable until aq, the others are melee and die. So the answer you are looking for is: No it would not be considered stupid.
---
They can also pick for the point and not take the loot.
---
All I now is that male taurens operate all the guns like a cowboy shooting an oversized colt. I find that kinda cool about them.
---
Bear as an OT works just fine. He's in the raid thus can receive loot.
---
Pretty aptly asked and answered.
---
While I have you can I get your take on dagger fury? How does dagger fury with CLG compare to a fury with a more traditional MH, but no edgemasters?
---
The return of Windfury in its purest form. By gawd the sadness I felt when it became a generic attack speed buff.
---
That's an interesting perspective.
---
The beta servers have been down for a while now. How are you testing the addons with no way to log in to the game???
---
Are you going to remake it in classic? :)
---
tooltips dont mean shit in vanilla, could be PPM restricted, could be ICD etc.
---
Payo is also another good rogue. He's also funny.
---
It just seems way more relevant to painting than to WoW, and imo belongs in a subreddit specifically for sharing painting. I wouldn't pop into the relationship advice to share my painting of a couple recieving therapy, nor the europe subreddit to post my interpretation of the map of Europe. Granted it's not all absentminded doodling, it's still not really WoW appropriate content just because WoW is the subject matter imo.
---
When he writes "stop heals" he uses Tidal Charm. If you pause the clip I bet you'll see it. It's an instant 3 sec stun from a trinket that has sort of long range. It's the blue water stuff that happens on the priest while the purple stuff shoots from his hands.
---
The priest is already stunned from Tidal Charm when he tries to Gouge him. I guess he wanted to Gouge him to CC the priest for a few seconds longer, before he moves on to the shaman. 
---
No, that's not exactly what happens. He blinds the shaman, who looks like a skeleton because of Noggenfogger Elixir. You can see the Blind debuff icon on the target frame of the shaman and you can see the blind animation from the player's hands. You can also see the stuff that appears over the head of a blinded target. The shaman is clearly Blinded.
---
And we forgot the mage that he used magic dust on in the beginning while Cheap Shot+Kidney Shotting the EFC druid. So in about 3 seconds he CCs a mage, priest and a shaman while his teammate kills the EFC druid who can't flee because of said Kidney Shot. I'd say that's a bit of a high skill cap.
---
EDIT: The fuken ego on you man. I walk you through the things you missed in the video without judging you and you're ignoring it because you're jacking it to porn that doesn't have any cuts. Thanks mate. Some people want save face in the strangest places.
---
Snowflake builds that do a fraction of the DPS of a proper build while at the same time not providing a unique buff that boosts the DPS of others.
---
Yeah very much so.  Paladins generally just spam FOL anyways holy shock is a PVP talent moreso than PVE. 
---
Warrior tanks definitely won't mind sanctuary either.  I always think of holy/prot as a PVP build because of reck bombs
---
Thats wrong
---
It's not petty rules, it's literally the core of moderation. That's why you don't see a lot of N-bombs being dropped on reddit, we're in agreement that racist shit shouldn't be posted so we accept the moderators remove it.
---
truefaith has +73 healing too
---
I mean troll females actually look somewhat conventionally attractive so i'd be shocked if they were that rare when the game launches.  But yeah nobody wants to be a cowlady.
---
They do scale well, but rolling ignites by a lower geared mage are still going to do more.
---
As I said, in a pure min/max, you prolly wont see more than one lock, but really there wont be that many guilds going that ridiculously hardcore. You are pretty safe rolling a lock as well.
---
Sp/boomy...hope your guild really likes you.
---
They won’t be. Blizzard has stated items will be released in the phase that matches the patch they were released with.
---
Nope, there's no talent inspection in vanilla wow. The closest you'd get to guessing someone's spec would be inspecting their gear... and even then, you could be 100% feral/ret/elemental and just be wearing healing gear.
---
Wolf in sheep's clothing.
---
Where would you need this in MC beside imp packs?
---
Oh I was mistaken about the trinket stun because the undead's stun animation didn't go through so I assumed he just stood there a second like a dumbass. Which he was trying to heal the druid, and the druid didn't die until well after the AoE fear, so the trinket stun didn't really mean anything, tbh.
---
But I wasn't saying 'pretending' for the shaman, but the priest because he tried to gouge follow up the stun and it missed.. but he had shadow reflect and could just save his energy and reflect the fear like he was obviously already ready to do. And the blind was completely wasted on the shaman too. Like he blinded him and then a half second later the fear came out, the shaman both. Wasted his time trying to gouge and wasted a long-term cooldown.
---
The shadow reflect was great of course, it's just that's kind of all that mattered in regards to the shaman/priest so everything else was distracting.
---
Also that warrior swinging Might of Menethil around was responsible for most of the damage on the druid, as well as the kb, looks like (no damage numbers came out on rogue side at the end there).
---
Hunter.
---
Can we do both?
---
Out of all of the paladin builds to call a meme spec, I don't know that leather-wearing healadin would be the top of my list.
---
&gt; I mean troll females actually look somewhat conventionally attractive
---
What the actual fuck?
---
We had a nelf warrior and pleanty of non-dwarf priests on a certain recent private server where everyone was a looooot more neckbeard about min-maxing. In the end no one really cares about how YOU want to play and we still downed raids with not much trouble.
---
That sounds suspiciously like private server shenanigans since Mind Control was supposed to scale with your level plus two or three.
---
I wouldn't still take it from warriors or rogues. It's good, but your raid role doesn't require you to have it. Rather give it to melee dps and main tank warrior. Maybe a good yoinking from BWL pug might do.
---
Played a lot of feral myself, and I can understand the need of standing on org bank/if bridge and showing your DFT to others, though :)
---
They are basically cow terminators.
---
I mean if you're minmaxing for pve you're rolling alliance.  So it makes sense.   Conventional wisdom is alliance racials and paladins are better for pve than horde racials and shaman.
---
What are you talking about?
---
You get it at 30 and it works on mobs up to level 32. You get it again at 44 and it works on mobs up to level 47. Then you don't get it again until level 58. Its usefulness while leveling is extremely limited.
---
Aww. Who hurt you? Was it a feral druid in STV? Did a shadow priest beat you up going to SM summon stone?
---
But if you put it in your batter, it will make your banter bitter. So buy some better banter so your butter is not bitter but a bit better.
---
Music festivals and raves helped me there. Just had to throw myself in the middle of it.
---
The cool thing is that you can choose whatever you want. If you have a tank and healer with you already, all of the DPS classes are open to you and honestly any of them could be hugely beneficial to your group.
---
Just pick what would be most fun to you. :)
---
pservers coded in autoattack leeway post beta. ability leeway has always been a thing, just without combat reach.
---
WoW memes just seem way more relevant to memes than WoW, and imo belongs in a subreddit specifically for sharing memes. I wouldn't pop into the relationship advice to share my meme of a couple recieving therapy, nor the europe subreddit to post my meme of Vladimir Putin. Granted it's not all trash memes, it's still not really WoW appropriate content just because WoW is the subject matter imo.

Pig is in classic. My understanding is that it was implemented before target icons were, as a way to differentiate pulls.
---
It's not, people just tend to go afk during the trash which can cause wipes.
---
Eh, a lot of specs have come and gone from being meme, even within the same xpac. I remember in wrath Subtlety rogues were seen as memey(?). They had decent exposure in pvp, but even then assassination was better. Boomkins were memes in the recent past...again. in the beginning of legion feral tanks were in a *very* poor spot compared to other tank specs.

I was thinking the exact same thing the other day. It’s almost like the devs saw the beta hype and implemented it into mechagon. I wonder how many ppl in decision making roles have been with blizz since Vanilla. My guess would be not many.
---
I'd clarify that those are only meme specs for raiding. Some of those are top-tier PvP specs.
---
Innervate is OK and brez is on a huge CD and only in rare cases will be the difference between wiping and downing a boss.  People are going to be in a for a surprise when they try to run the meme dps classes.

I disagree. I think nobody agrees. That's why I disagree.

Just splash some Healing Waves on them bitches and your marriage is safe.

You can ping it yourself. You're probably sitting at 60ms, which is definitely low enough to not notice.
---
Yeah, except the fact that 90% of those time the hard to fill spots are healers, not dps.
---
Well now I want one for the horde!

WoW is primarily about two things FOR YOU*: optimization and competition.

Man minecraft is pretty much all grinding for random shit, I'm sure kids will be fine with it.
---
If you want to PvP: spriest. It's easy to play but difficult to master and the amazing spriests definitely stick out in a crowd.
---
For PvE: mage has a more "fun" rotation in raids whereas locks pretty much just spam shadow bolt. Locks are more fun tho imo anywhere outside of raids.

Truefaith is straight better.
---
Both MP5 and +healing are better.
---
In todays meta nobody cares for mana, because you can reacquire it from a buttload of consumes and abilities (dark runes, demonic runes, innvervate, mana potions etc.)
---
No such thing for +healing.
---
Quit a month into TBC, WoW has never been the same without the original map.

Play a night elf so your trip from the gy will be faster.  Play a paladin and bubble heart anytime you're attacked.  Or alternatively embrace the bloodlust and murder some hordelings, its a good time I promise.
