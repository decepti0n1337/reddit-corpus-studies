If you’re a druid keep it. Got mine for 250g and I’m pretty stoked seeing how the prices have risen up to 400g+ now.

---
---
I would recommend looking up a guide for the quests in ulda. They are worth doing, IMO. And many of them are long chains that involve quests in the badlands, outside the dungeon, and throughout the dungeon.
---
Lol, Pilav is on point.

The atmosphere of a raid should be an eager teamwork party, theirs sounds like being berated by a high school gym coach. When people are happy and enthusiastically trying their best out of fun - things work. But when they're constantly looking over their shoulder and voicechat is dominated by anger and frustration, eventually no one will have a good time. Not to mention the tension directly manifesting people not playing their best, but instead are attempting to appease tyranny to not be gulag'd or publicly shamed.
---
Years ago I ran with lots of raid leads. The harsh ones laden with bad calls were hell. And when voice chat was "only for me, shut up" it was regular to have people slowly drift away from the guild or even just quit the game. There is room to try ones best and yet retain respect and congenial attitudes toward everyone. Tips is fostering a pretty lousy atmosphere. He shouldn't be leading. His tone is completely off putting. No one wants to hear that type of ragey communication.
---
If you’re on Rattlegore, can my alts get an invite?
---
American right?
---
I don't know where you're getting 'most' from, of the 7 hunters across 2 raids in my guild every one of us is trueshot surefoot, especially since you need improved feign for tribute solo.
---
Oh sorry random angsty reddit downvote guy, ill explain it for you in detail seeing as though you cant grasp the notion.
---
&gt; This describes **Fairbanks** perfectly. So tired of 10 on 1 battles its ridiculous. **They** need to fix the imbalance.
---
They as in Blizzard. No requests on how to improve his own gaming experience in a bubble or anything like that, no. Just a request to Blizzard that they do something to counter the overabundance of Horde on the server he plays on, Fairbanks. 
---
To which another guy then pops in, mistaking **OP for a Horde player**, and implies to him that he can indeed take direct action and 'fix' the problem, that being an overabundance of Horde on Fairbanks, obviously insinuating he reroll from Horde himself and directly take action to affect the imbalance. (He deleted his comment after realising his mistake so I cant quote him exactly)
---
To which OP then replies, 
---
&gt; Im **alliance**. How do i fix the very horde heavy population imbalance?
---
Which was the kicker and statement that made the previous poster delete his comment. To which then brings us to the finale, your good self chiming in and saying 
---
&gt; By rerolling Horde.
---
I hope your brain can now grasp and understand the reasonings as to how my tongue in cheek statement came to fruition, and why I said what I said to you. And no, I wont address the 'other options', that being literally

---
LFG implies you are expecting someone else to make up the group for you and invite you
---
LFM implies that you are making the group and will working to find every member of the group.
---
Mainly most players dont want to put in the effort to make up the group.
---
Warlocks and a good mechanical rogue will fuck me up. Also I’m on east coast on a west coast realm which means my ping is double the other players
---
nice dude what’d you click 3 spells
---
Plenty of groups for everything on my server but some days we still have queues so there's a loooot of people.
---
get a life
---
You need to be an engineer on the character you wish to use it for. Almost all of the engineering items are only usable by engineers.
---
Hit me up if you want to lvl a toon on alliance side
---
Engineering is good for tanking due to items for aggro and a few other things I can't remember. No reason you can drop and go with it later on
---
Hmm I think I hate you but I'm not sure.
---
If you're talking about random greens there's not much of a market to play. Lot's of the time there won't even be another of the same item to undercut. Certainly smart to just price to sell and avoid losing deposits though.
---
If you're doing this on commodities, you're just throwing away money for no reason. Your stuff will sell even if you undercut by 1 copper.
---
Yeah u can
---
This is so sad. Alexa play Despacito
---
Also: 
---
&gt; meme group, shadow priest
---
Lol
---
Benediction is nice. I heard someone recently say its 52% alliance 48% horde. Take that with a grain of salt bc for sure population count seems kinda sketchy but from what I played seems pretty balanced.
---
You must be new here. There's a few of us that regular post TPB/WoW collabs.
---
Its because there are people who want to run the dungeon, but noone wants to take the initiative to start a new party, but by saying LF4M you’re taking the responsibility of starting it yourself, so it requires much less commitment for them to join.
---
Did you find a fix? Also having this issue with the same error code. Happens a lot on flight paths and while I'm alt-tabbed as well.
---
You can continue playing on the same server. I did this when I was deployed to Japan for a couple years during vanilla. As others said, you will have a higher latency.
---
Try and sell it. The earlier the better. I played druid on a private server, got unyeilding maw but still wanted warden staff so badly, even though they are very very close in stats. theres something that feels good about knowing you have the absolute best weapon for your spec, and also it looks pretty cool
---
There is a very slight difference. LF4M implies you are leading the group and party. LFG implies you are looking to join someone else's group.
---
Your body is telling me no.... but your spirit, your spirit is telling me yeaeaea....
---
Satyrs for felcloth, they're humanoid so they also drop silver, runecloth, potions, greens and potentially blues and epics.
---
I honestly only saw him in passing twice. Like we were never actually AT the same node.
---
Yep. Stun the mob and you're even more golden.
---
One tactic I see many smart Druids do is to pre-hot themselves before they go Bear for the pull. That way the future tics cause a lil more healing aggro for you, while also helping the healer not have to heal as soon. Makes some bigger pulls be super easy when they charge in and have both Rejuv/Renew ticking away.
---
Orcs would still rather use an axe in their offhand. All of your offhand hits are white hits so the glancing blow reduction from weapon skill is huge. Bone Slicing Hatchet would be a comparable OH to Perdition's on an Orc.
---
You need exalted with the race faction that sells the mount. 
---
The advice ive heard was to start questing for the right faction from lvl 1.
---
Horde here, you should observe at Hillsbrad Fields in HBF and you’ll see your ally brothers doing the exact same thing. Both sides like to gank lowbies.
---
Ask them about C'thun trash pack comps and how some of them were damn near impossible without absolute perfect play and movement from 40 people. God I hated that trash. I remember finally, finally, everything clicking and we downed Twin Emps. "Ok, guys let's see what the hype about this trash is." An hour later we have 1 trash pack down and we call the raid. Twin Emps man. That's going to be a wake up call for a bunch of players. Fucking enraged bugs
---
Paranoia
---
PvP will be more common, but i don’t think itll be unplayable. Still, I’m lvl 54 at the moment, gonna rush to 60 and get decently geared in preparation of P2. Rather be the predator than the prey 🤓
---
Of course. We all feel entitled. (No sarcasm)
---
Reverse situation on my server.Fucking gnomes always group up and gank 3v1 ,5 v1 ..well i am done being nice now i hunting em all 1 by 1 :-)
---
Ok
---
More people need to know about this. Useful asf, thank you!
---
Right? Level 40 is typically a pretty pivotal point for builds
---
I’m turned on
---
Common knowledge for some guilds. Others just ask around in trade and eventually someone will tell you.
---
You are what you eat!
---
Thanks I may try this. What level are they and where located exactly?
---
Your LFG message should have keywords that stick out to skim readers. A player who is looking for exclusively a ranged class will skim the chat for appropriate class names, but someone who doesn't care will just skim for "DPS".
---
By not putting both keywords, a potential recruiter might not see your message.
---
Depends on what it is. Selling commodities like ore? You don't need to undercut more than 1c for people to buy your commodities. I usually price *higher* than the lowest and undercut what actually has significant volume, and I still always sell my stuff.
---
Lmao
---
Impressed with how badly he messed it up?
---
It’s like he was trying to look smart or important by adding in so much punctuation.  It just makes him look dumb, because it’s almost all wrong.
---
11 is for the epic mount. 10 was to complete the basic set for PVP. I just want that blue set lol
---
Where's the fun in that though? I truly hate mods like this that reward people for not being thoughtful.
---
This isn't a complaint, its a meme.
---
Boe means the priest can sell for A LOT of money.
---
There is a guy on my server that undercuts my mana pot stacks every other day by 4g i buy and relist, ive made about 300g off him
---
17 year old me back in the day loved those ones. Also anything for less than a gold, I really wanted to just click that buy button
---
Sure, but you don't have to be all sarcastic about it
---
I massively reduced it, I turned off that Network setting that is enabled by default and unchecked the FPS limit on both foreground and background.
---
That's how to get 55 water
---
I agree, my personal class fantasy for Rogues is that they are small and unobtrusive, like an Assassin. That's why my Orc Rogue is female. Male Humans and especially Orcs look completely ridiculous for Rogues.
---
I wish I could upvote this more than once.
---
I tried unchecking the network setting but it didn't do much. I read somewhere else that someone fixed this issue by limiting the max background FPS to 20, and that didn't really help either, but I'll try unchecking both. Cheers!
---
Imagine making a reddit post about it
---
Oh, ok.
---
Thanks!
---
Not sure why everyone’s hating.
---
I searched our realm and saw this post. I believe we ran some dungeons together!

if the undercutters' aren't worth buying and reselling, then your prices are probably too high.

Rolling your mouse-scroll to snipe every mispriced auction while watching tele is not active gameplay... Just being in front of your computer while screwing, over people who mispriced his items should not be okay or encouraged.
---
That's the vast majority of potions on my server (Sulfuras).  Health and mana potions I understand because they can be farmed off mobs/chests, but elixir of mongoose, greater fire resistance potions and all the other raid consumables?  Why?
---
Full disclosure: never raided on a hunter, I was talking specifically about situations you'd run into while leveling.
---
Point being that with a hunter, the gameplay can be varied. If you want a chill experience and just sit back and shoot: absolutely, it's an option. If you want to make it super involved and milk your abilities for every drop of performance they have, you can do that too. Pallies don't have that - there's nothing to distinguish highly engaged vs highly relaxed gameplay.
---
Aye Bucko hans off me ore!
---
You know what?!? I thought I had noticed it.. I’ve hit some rivers and was like “ whelp gotta mount up again “ but that big fucker keeps trucking on through like it was nothing lol.. it is a worthy trade off in that sense... I’ve only encountered two areas which are in UC and feralas next to the camp that has a huge root growing out of a tree over the road lol. I now know how to avoid it in feralas and I just constantly stay in cheetah in UC anyways haha
---
When I was playing vanilla and BC back in the day, I only bought mats to level skill, not to turn into something else to then resell. So I never paid that much attention to going prices, I would do just what you're saying: just buy whatever stacks are cheapest, make my leatherworking whatevers, and move on.  Cloth for bandages and herbs for potions were everywhere so I never needed to buy them.
---
there was a guild recruting that spammed 9/10 molten core and deep naxx exp in the same message.. after like 4 week mc

Special place in hell for people like that

The irony of your comment.

My friend had one come up to him to change his name!
---
The basilisk camp in southern shimmering flats. You'll get 10ish gold per hour with skinning.
---
&gt; There are plenty of times when a 40s price drop is entirely reasonable.
---
Plus if you want an instant buy, you undercut by a ton.
---
The hunter 1 is absolute trash and why so many people hate the class. Taking Dal'Rends or HOJ is just stupid.

Trolling angry people is fun because it is easy and satisfying

Yesterday I was passing by when I saw some level 60 mage at low health fighting a Devilsaur so I charged in taunted it and took aggro in an attempt to help him. He promply told me to fuck off and so I said ok on walked away immediately, he died and a while later someone else came by killed and skinned it. Im pretty sure the mage still thinks I was the asshole in this situation but I never found out because I instantly blocked him.
---
fingerguns
---
Plus if it's significant, you'll speed up your leveling and, long term, your total gold.
---
Rogues get a cape like that, I'm pretty sure
---
I bet you ignore people in game too when they say the mean things and make your feelings go ouchie!! Bawww!
---
Just tank with 2h swords then... Hard to feel bad for you when you're in a group of 4 spamming "LF1M tank" for 30 minutes and you are completely capable of tanking.  
---
  
---
Otherwise, you're going to have to put up with actual tanks not inviting you to groups because they don't want to compete for loot, and other party members asking why you won't just suck it up and tank.
---
Why would anyone post anything for less than vendor price??
---
&gt; 4 warrior one Shaman

Do you have auctioneer?

What’s fun and thoughtful about checking for the current prices and putting your items up for a little bit less?
---
You are a total moron though, and the guy messaging you is 100% right. Undercutting by anything but 1 copper means you don't understand anything about WoW's economy.

this has happened to me a few times. as a miner, I feel conflicted. I mean I want to loot the thing, and I'm not going to skin it.....but I don't want to let that particular guy have it either.
---
As far as I'm aware, Rogues are the only ones that have reduced falling damage after a certain level (it's a passive ability you learn I believe). Otherwise, slow fall pots like noggin fogger elixers and things like that would be your next best thing.

Yeah as someone else said check your weapon skill. My friend was super disheartened when he respecced fury before he realised it was because he had shitty 1h skills.
---
but why couldn't they make a class that just uses 2 handed weapons then? so it's better to just not play this game then if your forced to play a tank if u want to use a 2hand weapon

Yeah, most of my guild is 60 now, so I've been leveling on my own really and providing good information to them about DM and other things via Discord/guild chat. I had a resto shaman I grouped with that is basically still around \~41 and at 49, I just easily out level any friends I make so I end up leveling solo. So for the most part, I try to grab a group for whatever I need and I usually end up tanking 9/10 times (I actually got to group with a prot warrior last night, which was weird).
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt; \+5 weapon skill 
---
Most of the gear you listed I plan on getting asap, which isn't a big deal.  However, what do you mean by  +5 weapon skill ? I'm an orc, so got that covered there. Edgemasters was another thought but yeah, expensive now.
---
I was actually planning on grabbing truestrike and the devilsaur set around 60 for the easy grab there. As for Macros, I never really had a need. Here's a separate post where I share [my current keybindings](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dmopw2/favorite_warrior_macros/f53oc7d?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x).

Searing arrows is 100% an upgrade, its definitely your weapon skill

Yeah so it looks like rets are even worse than this post shows

these kinds of threads are silly. you chose to roll up on a pvp server.
---
Depends on how you define Arcane Build. There are plenty of builds which go down the Arcane tree including the primary “frost” raiding spec which is actually 31pts in Arcane! But the problem is Arcane doesn’t really have any primary spell that they can spam. Arcane Missiles is too mana expensive to spam unless you have clearcasting and arcane explosion is also expensive and AoE. So all arcane builds also have to use spells from either fire or frost. So the standard frost raiding spec goes all the way down the arcane tree but primarily spams frostbolt. 
---
In PvP you’ll see Arcane/Fire as PoM Pyro where they pick up the 21 pt talent Presence of Mind which lets you cast instant pyroblasts, also called “3 minute mage” since you can blow someone up every 3 minutes when PoM is off cooldown. You’ll also see Arcane/Frost in PvP. Most common variant goes 17 points in Arcane for improved Counterspell but you can also ditch Ice Barrier and grab Presence of Mind as well. Vurtne famously used that variant in several of his videos.
---
Is this satire?

I know retail wow has druid felines grace of some such, don't know how long back int the dev cycle that goes if you are druid.

Ah the 'ol "ignore a player then freak out at them".

Man this post just highlights the economy difference between high and low pop servers. My server has only one guild full clearing mc and the AH is a ghost town. Flasks are never on the ah and herbs don't sell - I bought a couple black lotus at 10g when they were the only ones on the ah. Have been trying to sell them for a week now. 
---
I really hope they allow paid server transfers. Joined this low pop because of a friend and it is rough.
---
This is troubling. That means we would still be out the 7500g+ in materials.
---
Also cat druids
---
I have been paying 60s on benediction
---
i was a naxx raider, but we only finished two wings.
---
I hit rank 14 on a warrior, but it was on a new server I transferred to from proudmoore during it's second round of free transfers so competition was light, and I was on disability.
---
doesn't mean I still remember all that shit from 15 years ago.
---
you realize there is such a thing as a bis pvp list right little guy?
---
Interesting I'd love to see a parse supporting that a blue could compare to Perdition's. That's probably a bit dependent on the rest of the gear too, right? Like if I had a net 10% hit rating on gear, the perdition's is gonna improve some over an axe, if I'm straddling the special cap right at 6% net hit rating on gear, the axe will shine more.
---
No context posts are the best.

Ah a fellow man of culture

Isn't this imied in 'LF1M' and such?

I came across a dead devilsaur earlier today. Got really happy, and thought I could skin it (no one was around, and I was lvl 51 myself, so I couldn't really kill them myself). ... Only thing was; it wasn't ready to be skinned, someone had left an item on it. I actually got sad, as it would have been my first ever devilsaur leather.
---
Karazhan
---
That's their fault for investing so much of their time and energy into it.
---
both factions have their share of both decent people and scum, who cares
---
It's more than that.  Maybe 1 in 2.  But most of those who aren't skinners, are in a party with at least one skinner who split up to cover more ground.
---
they tell people to shut the fuck up because they're mad about people still doing stupid shit 6 weeks into the game. the video is making fun of the guild pretending to be hardcore when they aren't good
---
Well you shouldn’t expect a 1% proc to win you any matches. But also a good Druid probably won’t use cat form on a mage except in the opener. Usually keeping dogs up, kiting and feral charge in bear form is enough to rot the mage down since the Druid usually wins the long game.
---
Tank here I get first orb reserved that’s typically 30-40 gold a run.
---
It'll be fine to even level in phase 6 due to all the catch up mechanics. Leveling now would obviously be preferred due to no honor yet and you'd be staying ahead of current content but it really doesn't matter. There will alwayssss be people playing this game, even after the phases end.
---
The angry whispers are what fuel me.
---
I think it's also worth pointing out that the boost from improved mark of the wild is very small. Small enough it's almost meaningless.
---
you need the addon called RealMobHealth
---
People who steal Devilsaur skins use macros to skin faster than you.
---
Take a word of advice and next time, sit on the ground, and wait until they leave before you loot the Devilsaur, because it can't be skiined by anyone until the perosn who killed it loots it.
---
only when you message them
---
Also mages
---
"put all your time into the game or dont play at all"
---
lol
---
Yeah spy addon is such a cheat

You /w yourself to make the joke?

Poor upset ally :(

Chaos ensues
---
Not true at all.  When I was leveling and questing through the crater, I was strong enough to solo devilsaurs.
---
I kinda have to disagree a little. If he’s following someone who’s clearly trying to mine and swooping the ores before him. Even if they’re just mining the same route he should have went somewhere else. Making him the asshole. Somethings missing here.
---
It's amazing to me that people care as much as to search the AH, see they got undercut, search the players name, and whisper them literally just to talk shit. Why not just buy the damn item, then sell it 40s more? Talk about "learn to econ" lol
---
are you reporting him?
---
Blizzard relies on reports to do anything
---
He’s a whale biologist
---
Nice of you to wait until they're done killing the mob guarding the ore before you mine the ore.
---
imagine someone playing a video game in a way they enjoy as opposed to a way that benefits you!
---
"if you don't like my undercut, you're free to buy it and repost at a higher price". Problem solved.
---
I don't think combat log will show me gnome behind a hill sitting afk doing nothing ,the guy i had no knowledge he could be there and wasn't in my sight at all...

Imagine being so bad at the game, you get upset when people hand out free money.
---
Don't mind him, he's just fishing for reasons to be offended.
---
My friend runs fury warrior even while leveling. Don’t let the haters bring you down. If anyone gets mad, screw em. It’s just a game, if you have fun dps’ing as a warrior, more power to you. Might help to have a friend to form groups though.
---
I guarantee Activision cut the cost of that department's budget
---
Also Halloween quests give all Horde rep.
---
Haha literally nothing in the rules protecting him for someone taking ores.
---
good point, could hurt you just as much as help you. 
---
It all depends on the person interviewing you in the end.
---
Just go full pvp when phase 2 and 3 come out.
---
If people can complain, curse, repost, whine, rage, etc on reddit, I don’t think sarcasm is out of bounds. I get Reddit is very sensitive, and when one person has an opinion, many others join in to belong or get upvotes, but I don’t have any problem sarcastically saying no shit or something equivalent when the guy is acting like he’s fuckin Nostradamus over here lmao
---
that's what i thought , a couple of days ago i could swear i sold a stack for like 1g, but tonight i sold a bunch for  6 gold, and they were going for as much as 7 gold as well, lol. I think one guy just really bumped up the price, seems like we're not that many selling them at the moment, if we worked together we could probably get it up to 10(that or if one of us bought out the others)..seems really inflated
---
Yeah I’m still kicking myself for looting it. I don’t have skinning anymore but I’ll remember not to loot it that soon if I pick it back up on an alt
---
I'm pretty sure that is actually against TOS. I might be wrong though.
---
how do people still believe this shit is faction specific? honestly blows my mind.
---
Ye, that was my bad. I didnt rewatch the video when reading your comment. So my first reply was wrong.
---
And priests.
---
True special event quests give rep for all main factions. Let me edit my post.
---
Yeah...a class that was in high demand and had some kind of stationary objects that provided buffs to the group the corresponded to the elements or something...
---
Rogues at the start a very slow as well but it picks up 20+ and more so 30+ I say stick to it
---
Fuck yeah. From time to time it happens that i enter an area and another alliance (i play ally as main) suddenly attacks a horde player where it seems like they've been there for quite some time together, only because now we would be two. If he looses his duel, he'd yell at me via whisper telling me i suck and should play pve server, why didnt i help him. As if its my duty to help a faction member when HE starts the fight.
---
People out here actually spending gold to be petty. Hell ya bruther
---
Yeah, clearly nobody that doesn't pick his race by abuse potential and doesn't pick his weapons by a +5 racial isn't interested in getting geared. Tryhards...
---
Yes I am
---
Is there an add-on that would track my kills while farming for a tiny crimson whelpling pet or would I just have to mark my kills manually?
---
Can't wait for TBC to hit where all these mages and priests take no more than 2-3 raid slots instead of a quarter. Im gigashitting on priests in healing done anyway as holypala. In terms of attitude mages are the worst. Prolly gonna roll a feral tank for BC though.
---
Oh and if it matters, this is [the gear I'm using](https://classic.wowhead.com/dressing-room#sMzz0zJ89cVcoo9V8MiV808cYw808cxT808M5Z87VcMt808Mia808c0C808cM7McYh808cXT87V).
---
For rings I'm using Masons Fraternity Ring / Ring of Saviors
---
Trinkets is carrot &amp; Rune of the Guard Captain 
---
Neck is Woven Ivy Necklace.
---
?hing you care about in that raid and dont mind dividing all the loot across the 15 warriors and 15 mages and disenchanting 2/3 of the class set pieces, and needing more consumables.
---
What?
---
Like, what loot drops that is going to be wasted if you don't have an enhancement shaman in Molten Core? I raid Alliance side. The only drops I've ever seen wasted are healing mail. Like, there are 2 handers that drop that go to pallies/warriors for PvP.
---
&gt; filling another 15th warrior or rogue to make the run ~2% faster
---
Look, man, I like off specs, too. But yeah. Some people want to make the run go 2% faster. And they are allowed to want that. And they don't want ret pallies or balance druids or enh shamans because they don't make the raid go 2% faster. And they're not bad people for that. 
---
&gt;The main reason for all that disproportional hybrid hate (specifically ret paladin) is that a vast majority of the top dps players, min-maxers, guild leaders &amp; -officers are playing warrior, and most of them are complete lootwhores.
---
Erm. No. Cmon man. They don't want ret paladins because 2 Ret paladins contribute way less to a raid than a holy paladin and any primary DPS class. If warlocks could heal or tank, that would be our only viable spec, too. We don't contribute damage, we contribute utility. So I get it. But the difference is, to get a paladin's utility, you can have them be a top tier healer and get that utility, or you can have them be a bottom tier DPS and get that utility. Same with enhancement shamans.
---
Raid Ret. Raid Balance. Raid Enhancement. You be you. But don't get mad at other people for wanting to do it faster, wanting to optimize.
---
mad season is pretty much the asmr of classic wow streamers.
---
Like if u playin the AH game and getting shitty about ONE market getting undercut by too much, u doin it wrong anyway haha. Means hes got like 1-3 things/markets max hes flipping, amateur hour.
---
it really pissed me off when they nerfed the slow fall from this in retail 
---
it was so fun for world exploration just yt videos left because they made it much harder or impossible in classic but you usto be able to float into hyjal using nog pots
---
Yes this is how markets work. Your product isn't worth that much, so someone will beat your price. Unfortunate for you but literally no one cares so better to adapt
---
It's good when used properly and in the right scenarios.  Rushing in without a shield before your healing Corp is ready is dumb.  Not using a shield on very hard hitting bosses is dumb.  Not knowing that fury tanking should have a shield to swap to on a moments notice is very dumb.
---
Yep, I change spec every week at 100g per week. ZF is really good money, I can do 5 resets in about 40 minutes for an average of 40-50g / set. Do that twice and you've basically paid for your respec cost.
---
Alternatively, elemental essence farming is pretty easy to do even if you're raid specced. It's lower g / hour (I get like 1.5-2.5ish per hour depending on competition)  but can be done in any spec.
---
Is this supposed to be impressive lol, they are just jumping around and you used loh
---
*Due to popular demand, we are now bringing the in-game store to WoW Classic!*
---
People are talking about how these are fury warriors and not actual tanks, but don't even take into consideration that for an example the number 2 paladin Esfand gets 5 Power Infusions and 2 innervates per fight to do this dps, while all being decked out in consumes. Don't look at top performers when comparing what's viable. Look at the average.
---
This is not an accurate representation of retri dps... It's way lower than that.
---
Exactly lol. It's just a waste if time going on a paly. Even on my horde toons. It's just a waste of time lol
---
I agree. I don't understand why everyone in this thread is defending him. Whispering about band and ToS is lame but not as lame as following someone around to take what they are after.
---
Why is vendetta so good? 26 twink weapon
---
if you know what you do it's far from a meme tho.
---
Go for 3 in a blizzard spec. If you're running the CoC / flamestrike AoE build, go for 2/3.
---
Decursive was broken shortly after Naxx release I believe. It made Noth go from a joke fight to a semi-difficult fight within one raid.
---
Gluth if they were on kite duty.
---
Noth for decursing
---
Heigan/Thaddius if they had a brain, but those two fights exposed every class
---
Arcane Frost 31/0/20.
---
Staysafe is really a great streamer. I usually just watch his farming and leveling, not raiding. But he seems like a decent guild and raid leader. I enjoy his stream probably the most out of the daily streamers.
---
The market decides what peoples time is worth, not you tho
---
They are a few different ones ranging from 38 to 44 or something. The lower level ones can be found to the east of Kargath base. There are a few quests linked with killing them and they drop Elemental Earth. I did the associated quests with them and earned like 15G from Elemental Earth + Solid Stone and about 5G from vendor trash. I'm playing a hunter so I killed them pretty fast. Helps if you're Horde too because they're located near Kargath base which is a huge meeting spot for them.
---
Mine is Ministry of Housinge Cat Detector Van
---
Repentance is a range spell. And it seems so many mages forget it.
---
Not defending his armor class post, but it's really sad how many people brainlessly follow the best google-ranking random list of items just to avoid thinking.
---
I'm sure if some dude managed to put a totally weird item on these lists AH prices for that random shit would skyrocket.
---
Ahh the memories, it truly is wow classic.
---
Who would let a warrior roll for mageblade lmfao
---
Just got level 40. No precisions. Took only the spells I needed. 2g short of the mount. Didn’t take long too get. 
---
Mount acquired
---
 lol this is the equivalent of "I'm not racist, but...."
---
People aren't adding me for BRD at 52 yet, hoping for level 53 (pally)
---
Before I rerolled to heal I had absolutely no problems getting into dungeon groups as ret. I think ret really shines in dungeons anyway, damage was pretty good + a lot of utility. But I could have never carried the guild raid like I do as holy pala. Most rets I see don't even try to be honest, they're just kinda bad at playing the game like many are it just looks the worst on ret when that's the case.
---
you know what they mean.
---
you'll be able to level warlock faster and easier if that helps and phase 2 is right around the corner
---
Some people are so entitled.
---
Happened to me in Wetlands with too many Murlocs.
---
&gt; vanilla =/= classic.
---
&gt; but go ahead and try to rewrite history.
---
Again, was there, an well aware of the differences. Making gold wasn’t one of them, if you were so broke you couldn’t repair that’s your own fault.
---
&gt; have I said that the irony is killing me?
---
It’s certainly pretty strong considering your last response. Or are you one of those people so unaware of their actions you actually don’t understand them?
---
It's assholes like you that made me drink fucking water at snack time you heathen.
---
You don't need PI, but at the same time there is no reason to not be specced into PI atm.
---
\&gt; leveling mining all over again.   
---
Now this is just plain cruel.
---
I'm going off memory, but if you look at the Badlands map there is a group of them to the southern side (in the mountains) and also in the south-wester side (also in the mountains) of the map. There is a spot for "lesser" elementals directly east of Kargath (Horde Camp), but I would not recommend it - that spot is usually overcrowded with people trying to quest.
---
I vote for the rogue. Warlock would be just another ranged dps with a pet.
---
Can confirm. I have just switched to keybinds E R Shift+R Shift+E and others. I have been playing this game wrong for years.
---
It's not possible for a macro to do this.  It automates gameplay too much and will never work, by design not oversight.
---
It’s a non copyright song, can probably use siri or shazam to find it
---
Not needing - ballsy group haha.
---
No it wasn't
---
I once had a dream that I accidentally started a secret quest chain for a legendary weapon but it was for warriors and not my class (warlock). Everyone on the server was super pissed because only one person could get it.
---
The first few of these videos are still funny as fuck even though they are fake haha
---
Best part is he did the most typing about how we were doing the pulls wrong, but he came to the dungeon with almost no durability?
---
Whatever. They screwed themselves by not being more careful. Can't blame the random person who buys it.
---
Because he probably isn’t sniping the nodes, just competing for them. I’ve had people demand I go to the other side of the map to gather, etc...  saying I’m “stealing their nodes”. I’m killing the mobs to clear, etc... but it’s “their circuit” or whatever.
---
seriously though just undercut by 1c
---
It's against the TOS, report them.
---
How do I add someone as Battle.net friend? Apparently I need their battletag but people have been adding me without asking mine, how do they do it?
---
It's funny, I've thought of doing shit like that. All because I was talking in /say to some guy who gave me a free Blacksmith thing for the mount speed on my Warrior, some dude interjected telling us to be quiet so we started typing in all CAPS and then proceeded to start typing in /yell - well long story short he ran off as we followed him thinking he had lost us he proceeded to continue his First Aid training, we came up on him and he just logged off. I waited around for about a half hour for him to log back on (I was bored), he never did and I've not seen him back since that day.
---
Yeah but if he gets undercut then that item essentially permanently loses value.
---
For a while, but then it would settle down because people would get bored with it. Also it would probably have a little bit of jail time still.
---
Plenty of new people, slow levelers, rerollers, and alts leveling up right now
---
Don't, it's super easy to get in.  People pug MC.  When players in my guild miss raids they just join someone else's.  It's easier to get into an MC raid than a Scholo group.
---
It can be really good, the problem is that no one wants to admit they are not good enough to do it right.
---
how does druid mana work in bear? does it just freeze at whatever it was and you are locked out of anything like mana flasks till you leave bear or what?
---
wondered the other day
---
like if you used half your mana then went bear and just stood there 30min would you still be half mana when you left bear?
---
It would be abused and useless.
---
You run surefoot if you lack hit rating from gear - and hit rating from gear isn't exactly hard to get.
---
Otherwise pick your source; hunter discord, icy-veins, wowhead. They all say the same thing. Trueshot/ferocity. 
---
\&gt;   especially since you need improved feign for tribute solo 
---
That is why they are going survival - I know its why I am.
---
I only have like 5 people on mine. You gotta earn it lol. Most people are just mad teenagers who don’t know how vanilla works.
---
You spend an hour or more following a stranger around, getting nothing done, and call that a win? Odd.
---
It cause while leveling there isn’t plus hit gear. Just level arms way better and the tank utility is nice.
---
How are people this stupid?
---
Yep, try to level it up. It is a life saver even as a priest.
---
your healing officer or whatever self important title he/she gave themselves is expecting you to heal as if you were in naxx and wearing your full t2 set and pieces out of aq40
---
i think the only time i made an actual effort to keep hots up on anyone was during maexxna progression.
---
Shaman can't use swords actually lmao
---
What level are you? Because if 60 I don't understand why you wouldn't have both. Coc shatters are a great way to aoe for which you want shatter maximised. If you aren't 60 probably usefeul to tell us how many points you have to work with.
---
This is my level 60 base aoe spec (mostly farm zf)
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/23000502--05350233122351301
---
I prefer to group them up, nova wait 3 secs then flamestrike straight into coc shatter....kite reapply coc, kite, nova repeat until dead ...mix in arcane explosions during kite, sometimes just rank 1 to fish for clearcasting procs. 
---
For me this is more reliable than blizzard aoe because resists are not as big of a problem, mob resists, hits your ice armor slowed, just kite circle back into pack. No interrupted blizzard etc.
---
I use 2/3 blizzard so I can sometimes use blizzard to fix a messy pull but then can still reapply coc slow (coc slow won't overwrite a 3/3 blizzard slow)
---
Alliance travel in packs and never respect the mak'gora
---
I drink my son’s Capri suns and blame it on him to his mom and his mom to him.
---
They both know I’m lying, but both are to small and weak to stop me.
---
Don’t forget the opportunity cost of having shards in your bags, limiting your space for so long too.
---
Yeah but unless you're rolling every gear pieces Ret just brings drama to raid loot since it's just doesn't make sense to give loot to to ret over other melee dps due how badly they scale. Full MC bis Ret will do less DPS than prebis only war or rogue
---
It's more efficient to just keep questing even if you pass 40 before you have enough.  I don't get this idea people have were you think you need to stop and grind for g.
---
Thanks for your contribution.
---
Can you do this at any level? And one of each cloth turn in (60 cloth) for each of the 4 factions?
---
What server? If whitemane ill buy you the charms, this game attracts some awful people.
---
Yes?
---
🦀
---
Yeah, but they didn't revoke your margin access until you paid up the full amount? That's how actual margin works. It seems to me that, to be realistic, they should have banned that character from using margin until they settled the full amount.
---
Nope it regenerates while your in any form! Makes leveling pretty nice cause of such little downtime.
---
If someone arrived at a node at the same time as me ill hit it once and leave rest for them. I'm probably kinder then most though.
---
you gotta pay for protection
---
"imp" is referring to "improved counterspell" which is talented into and has a 100% chance to silence the target for 4 seconds (if you take both ranks)
---
(i won't weigh in on anything else in the discussion because I am equally horrible in PVP on ALL classes)
---
It follows the 5 second rule but no bear abilities are spells so 5 seconds after shifting it starts to regenerate.
---
It was Arcanite Reaper. Human Rogue. Its ok, guildy helped out.
---
Just watched a fellow horde rogue attack a mage 7 levels above him for no apparent reason. I just watched and then applauded the alli mage once it was over. 
---
I don't know if he expected me to join in, but the alli was just minding his own business so why would I? Also, I hate rogues more than alliance mages.
---
If it isn’t cheaper than the ah then why wouldn’t someone just buy it from the ah
---
I did not remember the game been this intense. Its ok, guildies helped.
---
Imagine specing fury
---
sounds interesting.  i've also been looking into this spec and really want to try it because it sounds cool.  i really want to try it.  what's your dps been like?  What's your gear like?  anyway you can link it?
---
from some theorycrafting, I find the gear to be toughest part.    What do you prioritize?  I think the limitation when you're doing higher level dungeons is your spell and hit cap or you'll get a lot of misses/resists for your shocks and glancing blows and parries for your melee, esp without nature's guidance contributing to both and you can't find gear that obviously does both.
---
We’ve been discussing that AH prices have been dropping fast in the past week (OCE - Arugal). I got my Oozeling pet on Wed afternoon for 97g. Always wanted one so don’t mind being broke for a while, I’m lv54.
---
I always do it to test when I think someone has a market cornered with multiple alts. 
---
Easy way to make money dumping.
---
462 is lower than a hunter, which is the lowest bar for dps in all tiers. 
---
for farm content. who cares. for progression? if total raid dps is too low then the rets/ferals/enhance need to be sat.
---
Even better, start a territory war lol
---
lol he has no clue.
---
When I roll specifically for PvP, I roll alliance.  They have the best PvP racials, period.
---
Barrinv servers with huge faction imbalance I don't see it being a huge problem. There may be more gankers out there, but they'll only be getting HKs on green enemies, meaning ganking lowbies is still as useless as it is now.
---
There will be more people coming out to WPvP on both sides, so while you might find yourself getting a lot of enemy attention it should also be easier to find allies to help you
---
Hey thats my server!
---
Nice    4 solid stone!
---
If it makes you feel any better, you probably made someone’s day.
---
But all those people wouldn't get agro from a devilsaur unless they let one slowly walk right on top of them.
---
&gt; Have fun with your 3 hour MC clears
---
Thanks, I will. Have fun with your guild falling apart because you wiped in BWL.
---
Haha better yet, do exactly this but sprint towards  and take all mines you encounter.
---
Quest till 55 then start running dungeons for bis gear. Don't trip on xp your gana be in those dungeons for a while.
---
Hunters and paladins can use 2h swords.
---
Omg just show the name if it's real. Why hide it unless you were following him.
---
MC is not hardcore content mmkay
---

---
A few things, depending on the mob lets say undead, elementals, or dogs. Those mobs have a higher capability of detecting stealth. Also make sure no dots are on you at the time of vanish. As soon as you tick for damage boom it'll knock you out. Lastly I did a little research and some rogues use a macro that will stop auto attack as soon as you vanish. Reason being if you are mid swing on second hand I believe it will continue the strike after vanish is popped which then will knock you outta stealth. Hope this helps!
---
~Happy Roguing!
---
A mount I would think
---
I have a priest at 60 which I've been playing as Holy in raids and dungeons. I'm not really enjoying priest all that much and was looking to start leveling either a mage or warlock. I did play mage very briefly in vanilla so I am somewhat familiar with them but warlocks are pretty new to me (least played class in all of WoW) so it'd be something fresh. I'm looking to do primarily PVE content with a dash of PVP. Being top dps isn't super important to me, as long as I'm not last or keeping the raid behind with my low damage.
---
What are the pros/cons of each and what would you personally pick?
---
Yeah that’s what I plan on doing (:
---
Think it’s worth it to sell it now or wait until the market stabilizes a bit?
---
Early leveling(pre-40) using an arms/fury build I used fast speed daggers to tank 5 mans to help build rage. Later when I get deeper into the talent tree(s) and better gear/enchants its not an issue.  If I rolled fury( my goal is to tank at the level cap) I would assume my role as fury dps in a group or raid gave me a legitimate right to roll on anything that was a genuine upgrade.
---
I vote rogue. Lockpicking, stealth, melee DPS that never runs out of mana. They are excellent at PVP and PVE
---
Nah. They’re not all skulls to you. 
---
I had my first horde not red to me attack the other day on my 38 Mage.  As a vanilla horde player, seems like a lot of people rolled opposite faction. Or people are just punks.
---
Also had a skull level Mage have a dance party outside of Tarren Mill with me. We’d frost nova each other’s faction when they came by and try to chain it with cold snap, until they danced with us. 
---
Mandatory Dance Party. This shit is why I play PvP servers.
---
Sounds like a great way to say you are out of mana for the start of the fight with the mage.
---
So you somehow manage to perfectly hold ST threat just autoattacking and using judgement? I couldn't do that until I had full T2 gear and tons of other spell damage stuff. I highly doubt you can do that in current phase-1 gear unless your DPS are absolutely awful, or wait 5 seconds for threat on every mob.
---
Lol that guy can’t be serious. I got some hate in the Badlands because I saw an iron node but not the lil Paladin fighting a cat nearby. I didn’t even bother to whisper back. The ore belongs to the person who mines it first. Everyone else can go blow a murlock!
---
I’m lv 54, Holy Paly and thinking ahead to my first raid. What should I bring as consumables and buffs? Don’t wanna be unprepared but don’t wanna bankrupt myself needlessly either.
---
You better stop mining where I mine.
---
Ore else.
---
People like you are why the economies suck on all these megaservers.
---
At least they have the courtesy to forewarn the ring being reserved instead of ninja looting it... still, you reserved the one item people want, don't be surprised when nobody wants to go with you.
---
But heres the thing, no one can confirm that i was NOT in naxx and rank 14 as opposed to being an idiot 14 year old on a level 17 gnome rogue.
---
Therefore i was in naxx and rank 14 lmao
---
I'm not the right person to ask on this one, unfortunately. Sorry mate!
---
Alice is best girl of 2019
---
i think that's reserved for groups at the instance, so gtg means everyone is there, or you have a warlock in group and can summon.
---
40 silver is a terrible undercut on the item they are discussing in the screenshot, those go for 2.5-3g on my server
---
If a ret paly is top 5 I have bad news for your guild.
---
I always thought this also, like no shit Sherlock! I’m a fucking elf
---
Ikr? Will definitely come in handy on my engineer
---
I'm only lvl 40, and use 3/3 imp blizz, but you're right I'm silly and didn't think about CoC critting on shatter (duh).
---
I've been following JokerD aoe spec
---
Really appreciate your input this is awesome stuff!
---
You can buy nightcrawlers from fishing vendors for cheap. They also drop off of undead. The only expensive/"rare" bait is the Aquadynamic Fish Attractor, which is sold by fishing vendors in limited quantities. People almost never buy/use them, so they're pretty much always available anyway.
---
In PvP, yes
---
You want this to be reportable, seriously?
---
I just /slap the shit out of anyone who gets to ore before me and walk away like a real man/orc.
---
I don't understand the question....
---
Hey, another Lightning’s blade bear bro! Who was/were your toon(s) on LB?! Mine were Silly (gnome prot warrior) and Firelily (mage).
---
Except I chose my wording specifically. I didn't know if it is him or her, so I said follow them.
---
I just joined the guild for the free wifi
---
I've reported him three times now
---
No fall dmg for everyoneeeeee!
---
I was like 9 when I started if I did the math right. I started at the very tail end of vanilla (like tbc was announced while I was leveling or right as I finished leveling, something like that). I remember for sure I pugged mc at least once but I for sure didn't remember shit about it for classic, I can't remember if I did ony or not. I for sure ended up doing all the tbc/wotlk raids on normal, I cant exactly remember which all I did on the higher difficulties although I know a couple I did
---
That kinda just happens with everyone right now, until they are jacked to the gills. Heart NS is a really good spec that gets a shit ton better with gear since it relies very heavily on it. You might as well just respec out of deep resto since you really dont lose too much.
---
Meanwhile my guild does sub 1hr clears without anyone having to yell at eachother and joke around to an extent.
---
Here's what I do:
---
Go on classic.wowhead.com
---
-&gt; database -&gt; items -&gt; weapon(or whatever kind of item you are looking for) 
---
Pick a suitable level range(either item level, required level or both).
---
Additional filters: general: binds when picked up = Yes
---
This search gives you a list of BoP items(i.e. quest rewards and boss drops) and tells you where to find them.
---
I flag ran in late vanilla, and once you get the pvp set bonus that make your travel form move as fast as a regular mount it just becomes the most fun I ever had in OG vanilla. Raiding had NOTHING on the high of zipzooming that flag down the field at 60%.
---
some instances a seller might have an item that's not currently listed on the AH, so it would not be appropriate to specify "cheaper than AH".
---
sometimes a seller has an item that they want to sell for less than AH, so they specify in /2 cheaper than AH.
---
i don't see a problem here.
---
TIL treating one another with respect is someone's "strict standards"... I have been in uber tryhard guilds with full raid buffs where no one was raging on voice chat. Being angry at people in  WoW is useless and shows a lack of self awareness when expressed in public.
---
Having standards does not require getting bent out of shape - if you know how to lead.
---
What don't you understand?
---
Gottem
---
Thank you so much
---
You don't have to blur out the name we all know it's Karen
---
As a Horde I've never once not once been gang banged by multiple alliance whilst trying to get in to SM. Not once have I been 2.3k aimed shot crit as I rode through STV as a level 34. Never have I wanded a Warrior 6 levels above me to break the sheep a mage just put on him to heal him up then been instantly charged and 2 shot by that dumbass knuckledragging ape. And I've certainly not ever been attacked at least 50 times by either groups of alliance or alliance multiple levels higher.
---
They're such a honorable bunch! So when they complain about getting ganked by Horde, you just know they've never done it themselves!
---
Warriors where buffed to level better this is patch 1.12 so should be easy compared to what it was.
---
LOL reminds me of the time me (as a prot warrior) and a bear tank tried fighting in that "arena" zone in Legion.. after 5 minutes we both just kinda decided to say fuck it and went our own way.
---
Pls water with no HFC.
---
Get off the internet, dad.
---
Its called chat baiting. Bait chat into pop words to make them notice your advert over others. Its the same reasoning why i use LFM when forming a group instead of LFG. Learn to use words to your advantage.
---
People act like these arguments based on hard numbers aren't true because "that's not my experience." 
---
That just means the people you play with suck.
---
Because they're thick enough to believe that only things that happen to them actually happen.
---
I’ve been dual wield fury since lvl 20 (49 now) it’s playable but it is annoying to miss quite a lot. It’s not as good as 2h but it’s playable trust me. Just don’t pull to many mobs and take your time you will learn to play your guy.
---
On my server leveling my Mage, I had my first solo horde within a few levels of me try to gain me. So far at 38 I’ve never been attacked 1 on 1 aside this by someone who wasn’t “skull” to me.
---
80% of high levels just run by doing their thing, and 99.9% of horde my level are chill. But 20% will just straight up merc and camp you if you’re a lowbie to them.
---
As a vanilla horde player it feels sad. It could very well just be how it is both sides on the server and I don’t see it - but I also kind of have the feeling a lot of people rolled opposite faction from vanilla and Horde is the new “go to”/default faction for new players like alliance was in vanilla.
---
Please name and shame I want to undercut this guy by 1g please server name please

Is Cassandra Grace actually BiS? A green with +healing seems much better imo.
---
I bought a warden staff on my druid from a guy in a ZF run for 31g, put it on instantly, my friends all said i should have sold it for a few hundred gold for my epic mount,  no regrets its BIS the rest of the game

Well what you've noticed is wrong. There's a second roll.

Just roll a fuckin PvE server. It's only going to get worse when honor ranks comes out.
---
OP just wanted to show how he won a 3v1
---
Where it all began.
---
Naxx is UD? Ret is strong against UD.
---
It is useful for every class. Definitely worth the investment.
---
Yeah I do mine. But I’m not sure where all the best locations are in BRD where I don’t get aggroed by mobs.
---
Am a gm/raid lead. I am the skinner. I wish i had more upvotes to give.
---
I don’t know, I mained an alliance hunter in vanilla and I remember it pretty well. I didn’t raid or anything just did 5 mans. Eventually I quit and when BC came I came back on for a bit. It wasn’t the same though so I went horde and made a rogue. He didn’t raid either but it was still fun. Anyways, it got mighty ridiculous how they kept coming up with updates and patches and I couldn’t even get into a raid. I gave it up.
---
I played on Xbox and it seemed all p2w for the most part
---
Looooool
---
What a weird thing to be annoyed by.
---
That's correct. The one and only Alliance dominated PvP server came to be only because Blizzard thought it was a smart idea to let Alliance transfer off of servers that were already Horde dominated. Now instead of being 35:65, Skeram and Stalagg are more like 20:80.
---
No
---
Bear is awesome! Few tips that I learned during lvlving as bear tank. Top off people once in a while after a pull. Especially warlocks, the greedy bastards. If mana allows it, always throw a regrowth on yourself before  a pull. Helps the healer and helps a lot with your threat, especially when there is 4+ and we have difficulty keeping aggro on everyone. If it's two big mobs, keep your taunt and maul one mob. As soon dps go nuts on the other, taunt and maul that one. Now you are on top of threat of both mobs no matter what the dps decides to do. Gl out there and keep tanking! It's fun!
---
Or they get distracted and accidentally run into one.
---
I raided naxx and got rank 12, funny thing is there is alot of shit i dont remember MC fights, dungeon pulls, who drops what, what quest does what etc etc, why?, because it was 15 fking years ago...... mate i cant even remeber what i did in game 3 weeks ago.
---
A multiboxer ruins it but a mage aoe farming doesn’t?

I'd wait for BGs to release so that some twink drops crazy gold on it.

I say that to every horde I come across.
---
You'll be better served using a 2h weapon or even a a
---
Slow 1h and Shield than DW before you get some 60 hit gear. I'm 60 now and still haven't respecced yet because I only have 4% - could I do it? Yeah, but I would be dealing less damage. 
---
Also remember that DW requires two weapons to be kept up to par, while 2h is just one.
---
Warriors work best with stacking Strength as main stat, then Stam, then Agi. Agi will be on some gear anyway so you never need to stack it - it's useful but not worth sacrificing boosting your AP or health.
---
If you're deadset on being DW before 60 I recommend waiting until after your WW Axe is looking old and you have the two blue 1h swords from the SM and RFD quests. Then again that's right when you're basking in the joy's of Mortal Stike so it's tough to really fully recommend that route either. Good luck!

As an alliance player.... Fuck gnomes.. 9/10 dickheads are gnomes
---
I've seen this before, I thought this was a joke.  Is it not?
---
You’re right. See even an experienced vanilla player like me can make a mistake /s
---
Goddamn. Stockholm syndrome at work here folks
---
LOL same, ive been happily questing alongside multiple alliance, nobody causing anyone else any trouble, only for one asshat to come charging in and start swinging away. I always just sit back and watch, congratulating the winner. 
---
And on teh other end of the spectrum i've both messaged and been on the receiving end of messages along the llines of "theres X# alliance questing in the area, but they're cool so pay it forward".
---
Jesus fucking Christ. Can we just fucking come to the consensus to ban these fucking dweebs that use passive aggressiveness and then ignore like fucking babies?
---
They're clearly not old enough to play this game. 
---
Also, mods, remove rule that blocks names. Fuckwads like this need to be shunned by the community

Yep you’re right. Brain fart.

[400 dps for ret is world best in many fights. This guy is full of shit.](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/rankings/1000#class=Paladin&amp;spec=Retribution)
---
It's not against the TOU/EULA. You aren't following him--you're following the same nodes.
---
I think the better thing to submit to discussion is MC can be cleared by less than 40 people, not all of whom are 60, in greens.
---
If you can't handle a ret in the raid you're bad at the game.
---
MadSeason is the Joe Pera of Wow
---
I play a prot warrior by the books. Troll for the racials, cookie cutter spec, prebis farmed, hardcore raider. 
---
My favorite person to play with is a melee resto shaman who stacks mp5 hit and crit, totem twists, and his gear is all over the place. He is somewhere on the bottom part of both damage and healing meters. But fuck, does this guy love the game. And he loves his character. 
---
And his laugh makes me laugh every time I hear it. True hybrids are usually quirky weirdos and this game doesn't require minmaxing at all.
---
They right click &gt; add friend &gt; add battle tag
---
I'm level 60 and the mobs are 48-52 elites in BRD. I'm specced into camoflauge and deception so I can stand right in their face so long as I don't touch them they won't ever attack me. I actually located a video and edited the link into my post showing exactly what is happening to me in most cases. Distance and LoS doesn't seem to matter (have even been completely around a corner and it still didn't matter)
---
I get slaughtered
---
My point is you kite with cheetah till stoneform is no longer active then re-apply viper. Not rocket science
---
How do you kill that which has no life?
---
Big boy, huh?
---
You are so stupid... Seal of Light is HUGE, especially in a melee heavy raid or on longer fights. Over the course of a fight a single SoL can do 15-20k raid healing over the entire raid. Thats like having an extra healer.
---
You will get about 20g a level just questing no need to farm mobs.
---
Can I join a different MC instance in a short period of time?
---
Like, I did it with my guild on thursday, and I want to maybe join a pug to clear trash and farm rep before wednesday, is that possible?
---
&gt; I hate rogues more than alliance mages.
---
Found the non-warrior.
---
I absolutely hate mages. Mages attacking a warrior in the open world is like ganking a grey. If 3 of my faction are on a single mage i'll tag in just to get a smack in. Fuck em.
---
I understand some people want to tryhard the game but i dont see any enjoyement in this. 
---
I play to have fun, to get my gear who cares when, its not a race, world firsts were already set.  But each to their own. 
---
Also i wanna squeeze as much out of the game as possible. I dont wanna rush thru content in a week and then be angry at blizzard there is no more content. Especially now there is RDR2 coming out on PC, The Outer Worlds and my guilty pleasure - Paradox Grand Strategies
---
You may think im some noob, casual and such. Maybe. But my advise is: enjoy the game, stop at Barrens at night and enjoy the atmosphere (and toxic chat), sit at Booty Bay and just fish. Talk to people.
---
It’s not childish hur dur my friend I’m pointing out the obvious faction imbalance.  Maybe get some thicker skin.
---
Looks like he was the guy tanking the 2 adds and just spamming cleave...
---
I'm a fan of grouping by skill type and keyboard row/group, i.e.,
---
shift + 1-6: finishers
---
1-6: stealth and regular attacks (or openers if in stealth)
---
Z-N: cooldowns
---
R, T, F, G (also with shift+ versions): racials, trinkets, and consumables
---
For UI functions that get overwritten by the above (like C for character sheet), replace with similar Ctrl+ keybinds.
---
Well, it's only at lot of trust if you and your guildies are fucking assholes. If neither of you are assholes, all of you know that if someone needs it, he'll get it - otherwise, it's all greed and if you run things together often, the gold will probably get split. If that isn't the case - why are you part of that guild, again?
---
You watch the stream?
---
As someone who actually played the closed beta back in vanilla, ive stopped telling people in game that. Because every answer i get is a variation of "oh really? me too!". Yeah sure dude. Why do people feel the need to lie like that?  
---
I barely raided in vanilla, i did MC once and only the first 3 or 4 bosses. I remember it being super hard. Did ony and MC the first time since back then a few weeks ago and it was so easy i was actually super surprised.
---
(I'm aware that to everyone else its just as likely im a lying moron too)
---
It doesn’t matter what gender or sex or helicopter the player is. The fact that Acti-Blizz does nothing to police the toxicity is not a good sign.
---
Thanks !! Advice is much appreciated because I’m used to playing by myself I was pulling super cautiously until I realized they are there to keep me alive and I’m there to Keep them from getting smashed up. The role reversal was cool! I just got cat form and I’m loving how fast I can kilnenemies now lol but I’m not afraid to answer the constant looking for tanks now !! Seems like there’s tons of healers in my server , and a massive lack of tanks.

---
Toweliee is definitely not down to earth guy or chill lol you must of not watch him for a long time.
---
And none of those people would waste time killing one while doing those things since you get no reward for the time wasted and it's faster to just run a few steps to deaggro and finish what you were already doing.
---
I meant why they call them meme builds or meme specs.  But I like the footnote!
---
Sell the book, get an annihilator, be infinitely more useful to the raid.
---
or just use the book and walk around town with your sick looking weapon.
---
I wish Balance was a viable raiding spec
---
Is madseason more chill then WoWCrendor?
---

---
I don't see any other mentions of it in the 1.X patch notes
---
Well not that specific item, but just something better than what you are wearing. I saw a hunter replace a level 20ish white item with a dungeon drop the other day and I was blown away. I also saw a hunter need roll a no-stat melee weapon against a rogue who actually needed it as an upgrade. I also saw a warrior who was level 58 with worse gear than my (at the time) level 49 warrior. It weirds me out. At a certain point significant upgrades are pocket change on the AH. And then these undergeared people don't understand why they're bad at the game and complain on the forums that everything is too hard.  
---
I see posts about warriors all the time and how they can only fight greens, and my warrior up to level 54 can handle 2 yellow mobs at a time without much trouble at all, and one orange if I don't get really unlucky on misses (and if it goes south I can usually fear or hamstring my way out of it). I think the big difference is that I keep my gear up to date (and this is solely with money I make off seeling skins and ores and random pick ups on the AH).
---
Great input .....
---
FAP is against stuns and movement impair so I think it should work.
---
Im tired of you neets complaining about tiny things so touché.
---
Exactly, I never sell anything at market price for this reason
---
Nah, most of the time it's battles over the devilsaur skins, they sell well and people keep tabs on the spawns.  Almost all the time when I'm there there are 2-5 people at any given devilsaur all trying to get the skin no matter who kills it.
---
That's fair, but in wpvp there's usually enough obstacles to break LoS if they want to play that game. Kill the pet, eat and drink. If they come to fish you out just pop freedom early and chase him down.
---
Only villainous people need to fear their names and evil deeds known to the wider world

Maxxed out mana pots and high level buff food.

Does rf specify that it only works on holy damaged caused?
---
To be fully optimal sure, but he is just doing the first bosses, for that its hardly needed to be full raid spec. Hell for rag its not really needed to be full raid spec
---
When in a group, right click their portrait and select "add friend" then "add battletag friend"

Thats not even close to the amount it heals for. I've checked at least 10 logs and that's just not accurate that it is like having an extra healer LOL.
---
Ive lost all interest in the "big" names in streaming after they started to raid. Not that i was ever really into any of them. Now i just dont get why people like to see it, unless its because they find watching how bad and pathetic they are fun.
---
Imagine trying to make MC seem hard, and then fail so hard so often. Its painful to watch a bunch of rank 1 bfa players fail at ragnaros. Or watch the actual best mage in the world fail at shazzrah because he never decursed and then get mad at his chat and say "im sorry i did so much dps!". You wiped, it doesnt matter how much dps you did. absolutely sad and pathetic.
---
At least they bring a lot of attention to wow classic and that is a good thing regardless of opinion.
---
ML?
---
the problem is idiots who want to spec fury when their raid isn't even pulling off them as prot. newsflash, you don't need more threat. you'd be gimping your survivability for no reason at all
---
Honestly, you can outlevel the dungeons you want to run slightly and tank/dps with a 2h sword. You won't be able to focus 100% on dps but you can put up respectable numbers by using mortal strike, sweeping strikes, and whirlwinds while tanking.
---
Total dps should never be an issue now that people have 15 yrs worth of theorycrafting to know perfect gear and dps specs for raids
---
For non-gear-dependant, probably rogue. Go into BRD in stealth and pickpocket everything without much thought put into it - just make sure you don't approach bloodhounds (they have high stealth detection).
---
Hunters are a close second, because they can solo maraudon and devilsaurs, and the leather is good money. A mage's ability to aoe grind is a very profitable thing, but warlocks have higher survivability and ability to solo single targets, so they're both pretty strong in that regard.
---
You can... play it right now...?

i think dominos and bartender both let you save profiles.

---
Sometimes its not worth commenting, but as someone who is in the video, and raids with this group every week I feel like voicing my opinion on reddit is worth it this one time.
---
Tips is a very nice guy. Ask almost anyone that has had a conversation with him or ask anyone who has played with him. Hes nice, hes fun to hang out with, and he has worked very hard to create our guild and the community around it. 
---
Hearing sound bites from him taken from 2 raids out of the dozen that we have done so far and then chastising and calling him out is the kind of petty shit that reddit always seems to do. 
---
The raid that most of this footage is from was pretty messy. Healers letting our tank die, tank not allowing off tanks to pick up mobs, and a bunch of other sloppy plays. The things you dont see in this video is us all discussing the raid after and fixing our issues and trying to get better as a raid group. We all signed up to the guild to be "hardcore raiders" and none of us after took any offense to what was said by tips or the officers during the raid. The only ones taking offense to this oddly enough are people who don't play with us, havent been in our discord, and probably know nothing about most of the players in our group.
---
I personally enjoy raiding and hanging out with everyone in our guild. If I or any of our members didnt want to be in the guild, we would leave. 
---
This video in general is supposed to be funny, and I personally had a good laugh at it. But the amount of people who actually think Tips is a bad guy or the total unnsessary hate that is directed towards him is definitely disheartening. 
---
Just my two cents, I know everyone loves to think of Classic WoW and all the amazing people who play it, reminisce about people being kind or generous, yet at the same time people will just jump on the hate train just as fast. 
---
Kind of sad to see, but this is the internet I guess.
---
I love my raid and all the dumb shit we do, and I wouldn't leave them reguardless of how many times I am yelled at to heal the tanks!!
---
Sir, you don’t know a thing about me.
---
Oh cool, so I have to go back to retail because I'm talking about classic loot priority? LOL grow the fuck up kid. 
---
Its not min maxing to want to do well or clear fast in classic. Just because your guild can clear MC in 4 hours doesn't mean others want to do that. For some people trying to do well is what we find fun. 
---
Ret is a detriment to basically every raid it is in period. Giving them gear over other melee dps is a sure way of getting good melee dps to find another guild. If youre gonna be a meme spec at least embrace that's its terrible and don't cry about it whenever someone mentions it.
---
In what world is telling someone they missed my point uncivil?
---
level the lock now, use money from your lock to gear your rogue as you level and leveling will be a blast.  also, i would personally rather level a class with stealth capabilities during phase two.  i can’t even imagine how many corpse runs this will prevent...
---
The worst thing about classic is modern gaming.
---
Did you simultaneously accuse me as being narcissistic while at the same time telling *me* what point *i* was trying to make?
---
I was making fun of the faction imbalance and how there’s always 5 horde to one ally whenever you fight.  And it does have to do with thick skin because this *clearly* upset you.
---
&gt; I know exactly how it works
---
Well, the basics at least...
---
Neat we just raided Org on Incendius around the same time today.  Our was more of a huge pack it’s neat to see the RP version with your legit military formation.  Good work! FOR THE ALLIANCE!

Get confirmation from the people designated to sheep/banish at boss fights.

After going over tactics, repeat the important parts quickly. like: "groups 1, 3, 5 go left side, 2, 4, 6 right side"  
---
Type it out aswell. Voice can be hard to hear sometimes.  
---
Make sure you say "please let me know if there is anyone thats uncertain about what to do" and make sure no one feels stupid for asking. thats gonna make sure no one ever says they are.
---
probably the most important is to explain tactics in a short as possible way. like: "All melee stand here, healers stay in range of melee. ranged stand here. when you are the bomb, move away from everyone. move out of fire."
---
probably the hardest thing about these raids is to make sure the 39 other people actually hears you and is not afking.
---
So and so, trying my ”best” to get out of the rut that is weed wow and jerking off 24/7 :D
---
&gt;The fact that the warrior happened to pick an lol3buttonrotation dps class at character select doesnt make them a better player
---
No but it makes their weight pulled in the raid much higher. 
---
&gt;Youre just too young and dumb to see that though. I bet you dont remember 9/11
---
LOL yes I must be a kid because I have a different opinion than you. Shut the fuck up.
---
Well trap to viper sting to completely drain your target of mana before you start fighting definitely wasn't a thing

well i made it to lvl 60 and have more than half of my BiS gear right now but atm it's been 2 weeks since i last found a group and so far people have been getting more toxic with me about tanking (even though i type in LFG that i am a DPS) the reason why i don't tank is because i get really bad anxinty and well i just can't keep aggro at all as a fury warrior with sword and shield.
---
lol. its their own fault for not paying attention.

I've used Thrash Blade in MH and Hanzo Sword in OH. One thing that throws me off is that if I parry an enemy's attack, my attack speed will abruptly increase slightly and use up my heroic strike before I can cancel it. It also feels like something that's very difficult to keep track of while you're simultaneously using your other abilities when fighting multiple mobs in a dungeon.
---
Any advice?

Welcome to classic/TBC/early wrath vanish :)

I got whooshed too on my first read of his comment. Which made your comment great. Then I reread his and understood how his was actually a great comment. But then it made yours even funnier somehow.
---
Thanks bud!
---
Man... they mixed up the most iconic troll of all time IMO. Vengeance for Zul’Jin!
---
Yes, and the 5SR applies as well etc
---
except with spy you can do the exact same with just tweaking your combat log. if you knew just a tiny bit about the game you'd know that
---
Same thing happened to the dwarves
---
People are forgetting because they have been spoiled for so long, but in classic once you mine or herb, the node is gone.
---
Op should have found his own instead of trolling someone and then posting about it on social media.

You dont have the gear now to get maximum of HOJ yet. It scales better when you're better geared. Get the Rogue quest for chance hit and get higher crit/dmg head and such. HOJ becomes better later. Calm down.

Everyone is assigned a number in the raid list already. ML rolls and loot goes to that person.

There's quite literally no difference between Horde and Alliance in wpvp as far as behaviour goes. This is so stupid smh

How do you track the bobber? Just listen for the sound?

Damn straight! I loved soloing them on my frostmage back in the day.
---
Lots of people in here chiming the merits of undercutting for the quick sale. What they dont mention is if it's a slow moving market. With their undercut they probably still wont sell, get undercut, and now the market price is much lower. In theory great idea, in reality they did nothing to help themselves and hurt themselves and the other sellers by lowering the price.
---
"I dont care about the market, I want a quick sale," - with most people using addons for AH, undercutting by 1c puts you at the top of the list and first to sell. And if you get undercut by 1c, who cares, orive is the same go ahead and relist.
---
Claiming that someone is committing a bannable offense, falsely, is the same thing as pretending to be a Blizzard GM in my opinion.
---
This guy deserves a ban.
---
You can also solo 2 of the 4 dragons for your offhand just fyi. Honestly I'm not even worried about farming those bracers since I have other pieces that are a much bigger upgrade I still need.
---
Ive literally never seen an X horde v 1 alliance, EVER. Pointing out that your anecdotal evidence isnt an objective truth is NOT being upset, but nice try telling me how i feel. Just because there's an imbalance doesnt mean every fight is also imbalanced, but man you guys sure want to try real hard to make it seem that way, despite the fact that in *my* case the only imbalanced fights ive been in were always weighted towards the alliance.
---
Nah I undercut everyone
---
I've been leveling ret and I don't understand these people that are wearing leather when they could be wearing plate. Why? I'm supposed to wear mail and plate, incidentally both have the stats I need. So these people needing on cloth and leather baffle me.
---
If you turn off auto loot you can sit there forever hunched over and really piss them off. 😏
---
I understand what you're saying, but in this case it wouldn't be a ninja loot right? That ring is the BiS for most/all melee classes, isn't it? Unless they told the tank "I don't need it", and then proceed to need it, it's fair as far as I can tell. I only bring this up because I see the term used very loosely, but I think a ninja loot that goes against an agreement is punishable by Blizzard, so knowing and being able to prove the situation after a ninja loot occurs is kind of a big deal. 
---
I do agree that they should be applauded for their patience of forming a reserved group.
---
Dude just wanted to add punctuation wherever he could. Jeez, makes him look more stupid than just not using punctuation at all...

No-life, tryhard, and elitist is reserved for people who have better gear than me.

Na I know I was goofin.  Very true, cause as a warlock that's been ganked by multiple people before, can confirm this would go very differently.  Although I can make a mean comeback with deathcoil, healthstone, voidwalker sac, and soulstone (worst case/if it's up), that only works to take down one person, maybe two lol.

You could complete the chain on a DK? There was DK scarab lords with the transfers, I’m certain of it.

Yeah I raided with a Malay guild back then and they didn't have any issues. I think ANZ gets a little worse connection though.
---
Do you have a logs link I could take a look at? Sub 1hour is hella fast and I'd like to take a look at things my raid could improve to get it down to that time frame

Vanish is one of those spells that has just always been buggy.

I healed sm arm as a resto druid way to many times. But it was so fun and effeciently. I ran with 3 warriors and a enh shammy. They just went to town on mobs with windfury and destroyed everything, it was so satisfying to watch 4 ravagers proc at the same time.
---
Is there a working addon or weakaura to track enemy interrupt cooldowns for PvP?
---
Take Esfand for example, he is the leader of one of the most successful alliance raiding guilds on the streamer server (and is a ret paladin.) You're going to say that he is selfishly prioritizing his fun over the success of his raid and guild simply because he isn't holy? You're gonna say one of the top alliance raiding guilds on that server is being led by someone who "doesn't make any meaningful contribution?" That's just absurd.
---
Also, you didn't mention it, so it's worth asking: I assume you have Vanish rank 2?

Dude, watching a pilav video is too much to ask for man. Please.

Ive done that!  In fact if you have auto loot turned on, you just hold shift.  Ultimately someone will think you've lagged out.
---
Resto druid here, i healed 3 warriors and a enh shammy. Shit was so fast we were able to run at least 10 times before anyone called it quits.
---
Some of them are so awful and he has 0 understanding of the classes being dived into. He cant even engage in any meaningful discussion on any of the deep dives. 
---
As a lifetime druid who did hours and hours of theorycrafting back in 2005, I found his druid deep dive embarrassing at best. The people he brings in 100% know what they are talking about, for sure. The problem is that tips treats everything they say as gospel when theres almost always a metric fuckton of nuance to every decision in classic wow. The people he bring on represent, usually, about a third of the whole truth of any given meta. Especially since most of them are strictly pserver theorycrafters.
---
Theres a difference between a pserver theorycrafter, a vanilla theorycrafter, and the modern classic theorycrafter.
---
In general, im happy for Tips success. I truly believe he put in work. However, his wowhead guides are garbo. He really shouldnt be acting like he knows things. Just more leeching off other peoples knowledge
---
Ya, I hate this guy.
---
If he was more genuine, he wouldnt be creepying trying to  get his paws into everything, and he sure as hell wouldnt be acting like first hand authority on how the game was played about 5 years before he took it seriously.

When you kite with cheetah I run the other way mount up and take off. Your going to either come back and get repentance or I'm going to come back and HoJ. Your move cheetahboy

Yep, if you message me and are a dick over something that I didn't realise was even happening *and* I'm absolutely allowed to do anyway.. you can bet that I'll be doing that thing on purpose thereafter.

Doesn't might apply to pets, so potentially 9 targets.
---
I mean, I don’t care for the guy but he did NOT do all of these things. He was in his early twenties when his fathers company was doing this, all he ever was was a signature on papers.

My father has a company, I’m a signature and a seat on the board. I would be in Tips situation if my father was doing something fraudulent.

---
No expert on this by any means, but my two cents: Casters are generally less gear dependent. Rogues can do worthwhile pickpocket runs from SM and on. Hunters and warlocks both have pets, but between the two, a lock can dot up a target,  toss their pet at a mob, and can move on to farm a node with it being dead by the time they're done, while also having no food/taming management. Locks also get that free 40 mount, so that's less gold up front as well, if that's a factor.
---
I think we all know what a mage can do in regards to AoE farming, but if you play a PvP server like me, they're easy targets when this occurs, so I don't know if that's something to factor in as well.
---
Finally, even if it's for gold farming, I like to consider which would have the easiest time of finding a group/instance, in which case I think the mage (food/sheep/AoE) and lock (SS/summons/AoE) win.
---
I picked up herbalism at level 60 so i can pick herbs and get potions made for guildies for raids instead of buying the mats.
---
I had to start at level 1 and i was herbing in durotar. I was 5 herbs in and got the message "go away you level 60 fuck" :(
---
Once you get familiar with people pugging make sure to inspect them every once in a while too see what they are wearing when flexing in main city. It is a plague in WoW classic pugs where people unequip epics before the raid, pretend not to have them just to roll on them again and then sell it secretely to people who didn't win the roll.
---

---
Quests, crystals, herbs. Lots of reasons to be there actually.
---
This is correct, you get a percentage of the xp based on how much of the damage you did.
---
Going up and down the Steamwheedle coast is a good one to try. Floating wreckage gives those cloth and leather drops. There are firefin, blackmouth, and stonescale pools there. This person might've been doing that.
---
SM Cathedral with the Hat/Amulet.
---
Staff from ZF or Dagger from SM Library + Shield and off-hand from SM GY.
---
pretty much just look for anything with +int on it and go wild.
---
Ask yourself, is this mage gear? If the answer is yes then that's what you want to wear.
---
Tried this too, didn't work. It's still giving me the "you have no target" message even when I have them targeted
---
I kept a healing set while enhance and switched to those items when I specced ele at 35. The ah will have some things for you, caster gear in the leather and mail category are either way overpriced or dirt cheap. The turtle scale items are a good start and usually cheap, int mail. Sm has some great pieces in lib and cath. The mountainside buckler is an amazing shield that's usually cheap because no one but shaman want it, 40s boe usually in ah.
---
Bout all I got.
---
That is really the hardest part of the game. Turnover. Burnout. Gear progression vs Time.
---
Same with ours - could barely recruit anyone without guilds cannibalizing one another. Find someone? Gear needs weeks or months of BWL drops to get up to par with AQ40-Naxx to be able to survive. Especially with TBC looming, few people cared about farming raid consumes for a soon to be defunct raid. I bet lots more would have seen Naxx completed if there had been more time.
---
But truly by then, the landscape of the playerbase game was desperate for a refresh &amp; expansion to stop the exodus. Sad that the 25 man raids gutted the guild communities again soon after.
---
No, it's pretty easy. Just keep your gear up to date by hitting the AH and buying cheap greens (or cheap blues if you get lucky) periodically, prioritize always having a good weapon. Don't neglect armor as a stat, it helps you survive inevitable chain aggro. Ignore the metasexuals. I'm level 54 and pretty much my whole run on this warrior (leveled one ages ago in retail too) I've been able to do fine against same level mobs. Keep in mind that demo shout reduces the amount of incoming damage, which can seriously cut your downtime.

---
you don't need anywhere near that for MC. tbh, if you have bandages, a food buff, an elixir and mana potions, that's more then enough.
---
Pro tip - always roll last. If there are any ties, the system gives it to the last roller, not the first.
---
This isn't true. When this happens you pop rage and turn on sweeping strikes and start whirlwinding. If your gear doesn't suck you'll finish them both with a good chunk of health left over.
---
i'd say go with dungeon grinding if you guys can always form a group. questing sucks, it feels so disjointed and so much wasted travel time.
---
As a rogue, I go after pallies all the time.
---
Force the bubble, vanish, stalk, and kill.
---
Honestly the most annoying part of pallies isn't the bubble but the run speed increase. If my CD/trinket isn't available, doesn't matter what I do.
---
STV much?
---
Don't worry, you would know. The demon lets out some lines calling the Hunter a coward that would be hard to miss, and the hunter would either send angry whispers or angry arrows depending on faction.
---
"Listen kid. I'm a nice guy *fedora covers eyes* but when you steal my ore,  the world trembles, bucko." 
---
Also nah not a punishable offense. I spent an hour spam banishing water elementals in felwood since I was trying to protect the environment and save our planet and didn't get banned
---
That is what it says, but it is not what it does.
---
There is less pressure when you don't care if the hunter who can't help but multishot the moment you pull dies or not. Then it becomes a fun game of "how many times will this guy do the same thing before he learns." Also the answer is "infinite times."
---
I'm just going to say that my friend was a main tank for a top guild back in vanilla, had one of the first 20 thunderfurys in the game, cleared aq40, naxx you name it. I got him to come back and play classic and so far I have had to tell them that the deeprun tram exists and will take you from stormwind to ironforge and that you can buy additional bag slots in the bank. So just because they were really good and hardcore 15 years ago doesn't mean they remember shit :p
---
You also fly straight through the castle wall when you fly out of there on certain paths.
---
Fear bombed my way out of that one more than once. Also hamstring works if you have enough health to take a few more hits and you strafe run until they stop hitting you, then turn and book it.
---
I know its a joke but is Naxx that hard ? I was told many times before classic release that " OMG MC will be so hard , its not like retail , you will suffer. You need at least 450 fire resistance for everyboss or you will be one shoted"  
---
But acctually its verry disapointing difficulty wise. Even Ragnaros is a sub 3 minut fights with a single mechanic as a melee.   
---
Hope upcoming raids will be harder. I want to wipe
---
Bind sinister strike to E. It’s not very tiring on your finger to keep spamming the button
---
He's probably cannibalizing one of the alliance skeletons a few feet away. I don't think it works on allied npcs, but my memory's foggy. Probably because of all the cannibalism.
---
Nah the one in the bottom left with his shout on it.
---
Bucko's taken.  I haven't checked, but I feel like I can guarantee it.
---
While leveling it's a pain to queue as a warrior DPS because tanks are always in such high demand. However, until 50+, you really can get away with 2h tanking. If you're doing an at-level instance you'll still want to use defensive stance for a majority of it (damage reduction and threat generation), but you're more than encouraged to stance dance for berserker rage, whirlwind, cleave, hamstring, thunder clap (or whatever that one is called), execute, sweeping strikes, charge, etc. Those effects will not go away just because you change stances, FYI, so you get to still DPS quite well as the tank.
---
I wouldn’t go ele tbh.
---
Yeah, look at starcraft. It's more effort to balance, but not needed by any stretch.
---
I know exactly what you mean. The names drive me insane.
---
Is that a Bleach reference?
---
I dont use autohotkey but not to stay logged in. Now,  Im afraid of using afraid of using autohotkeys because of this even though Im  doing a legal 1 to 1 remapping of some keys and not using a script that keys me logged on.   Besides I play retail. Sucks though, everyone is on  classic
---
Sadly lots of young people lack the foresight to limit their time investment  into such things
---
You downloaded the retail version. Go and install the classic one.
---
What is so confusing? He is right.
---
Honestly we should start doing the same with Gnomeregan. Just hang there like dorks and killing Horde that come.
---
They usually don't go there very often, tho.
---
Quin isn't toxic, but he really shouldn't have played ret paladin in classic I think. He had a really good chance to blow his stream up with it.
---
This is my experience too. I think a lot of people are just repeating shit they read instead of speaking from personal experience. I made enough gold on my own (with a friend of mine throwing 5 gold at me one time) to keep my gear not just up to date, but better than most other players (mining and skinning). If I get a 2nd add I just turn on sweeping strikes and whirlwind them down.
---
Too many people are metasexuals these days, and spend more time rubbing their junk on spreadsheets than playing the game. Look how  long it took the metasexuals to figure out that heroic strike was making offhands hit with mainhand level accuracy. Warriors are fun. Plus you can get groups more easily than almost any other class (druids and paladins with both tank and heal sets might have a slight edge).
---
Wait. I bought one for 100g on my server, guy really wanted his 40 mount. Will easily be worth 3-4 times that when P3 comes around.
---
How is this better then item reserves? Now you're just class reserving.
---
Rode by the other night, saw every spawn up and only one guy. The lucky bastard.
---
That's unfortunate. People shouldn't be getting toxic with you over it. You would definitely be welcome to raids as a dps warrior. But in 5man groups, you will always be pestered to tank.
---
The fact PCing is taking over the world is  a fact. Still it's a BS use of the word due to extreme recent social engeneering. Oxford or not that doesn't make you right although it makes you feel socially validated.
---
Nice
---
Its not.
---
-rogue with literally days /played in brd
---
It only depends if the item price is stable. I seen some people try to buy up loads on ah and reliant at a higher price.. it works.. for like a day lol
---
Then the prices always go back to the stable price.
---
Also this is only true for small items like cloth and ore. For expensive items like edgemasters it usually sells slow and no one is buying more than 1 at a time
---
That was a whole lot of conclusion that you jumped to!
---
Yes singular data point, of 7 days played time on both factions. You sound just like every person who on the /r/wow subreddit saying "no man its the same on both" now its a MASSIVE issue and breaking the game environments because you can blatantly see that more horde pvp than alliance. No matter what data I present you, you will say "thats singular data point" even though its hundreds of interactions over the course of months. Which is stupid but thats your argument man.  
---
If you dont realize that at any given moment the chance of a horde walking by is higher and on some servers SIGNIFICANTLY higher than you are an idiot and i cant help you...
---
are u hemo for pickpocket?
---
Thanks for the 200iq post but the single inland mithril cylinder in question got bought a few minutes later and I walked away with my 1g60s
---
I put stuff on the AH for what I'm willing to part with it for. Unless it's substantially less, then I wait maybe until the next day and post for what I want anyhow. I sell 90% of the time *shrugs*
---
If it’s less than vendor price then buy it up and sell to vendor??
---
No it's not anything like a guarantee. Played a rogue in TBC and you learn the nuances of it eventually, sprint helps, distance is key, whether they are swinging at you when you vanish is important as well. It's all timing really.
---
Because I’m not asking people to say no to something they could use. If an item that any class could use drops then all should be able to roll on it. Plenty of people are running groups, asking people to contribute and then actively asking them to be excluded on something they could use. There is a tiny difference but there is a difference.
---
Source?
---
You're welcome, I guess?
---
Shout out to Gay for the shirt
---
Yeah but you run each dungeon a bunch so u will get all the drops no issue
---
I vendor or dust most stuff. Auctioneer tracks the expected de price so I dust it if it's 5% higher or more compared to vendor (have to mail to bank alt). 
---
I only auction cloth +healing or frost wrath gear. I am positive I miss out on some gold, but the extra gold I make not spending 5%+ of my time messing with auctions on AH deposits more than makes up for it
---
Absolutely agree with this. Just yesterday I had a conversation in barrens chat about how redundant it is. If I said "LF Tank WC", then that's all we need. It's not like the healer spot is missing but we're not including it in the advertisement.
---
The go to play in classic was putting all the gold you had in a trade window, then just going and making yourself a sandwich -- seeing how long the other person would stand there and beg for you to hit the 'Trade' button.  In my experience, they would generally leave you alone after that.
---
Whenever I start watch a video of his, I cant help but chuckle at how ridiculously sleepy he sounds.

This. Clearly OP was being an ass, but the dude who wrote those messages sounds like a man child.
---
Hunter is the least gear dependant class in classic. They scale weakly with gear in comparrison. Also they Are one of the easiest classes to gear due to loot competition in raids. Much like the lock, which is also a petclass able to solofarm most the same things as the hunter.
---
Rogue is very gear dependant except for a basic pockpocket farm, which is extremely poor gph compared to the other 3
---
Mage got ZF (45gph) and DME fel lashers (55+ gph) but Are fairly gear depdant and is the class with most loot competition in raids.
---
Both hunter and lock Are top 2 in gph farming (tribute solo and DME solo) by a sizable margin atm possessing decent gear. 
---
I would advice one of those two. Also both can pull 40gph+ in mara with mediocre gear and little skill if you dont want to stress it. 
---
Both are also great sololvling classes, if you dont want to get tired og ZF before you Even start farming gold there.
---
Was only streamed in front of thousands of people
---
They scan the AH almost constantly and build a database for the going rate of an item on a server. Then when something is errantly posted at 5% of its going rate, the add-on alerts the player to purchase the item for relisting.
---
Do DKP or another point based system. Dont loot council. Loot council is dumb af in a game where min/maxing doesnt matter in PvE. Classic is not about min/maxing. Its about playing what and how you want to play
---
I got it working.  
---
'#showtooltip
---
/cast [nomod,@mouseover,help,nodead][help,nodead][@player] Holy Light  
---
Replace "Holy Light" with whatever spell you want. This will prioritize the mouseover, then your target, then heal yourself if neither condition is met.
---
Actually mining nodes take 2-4 hits to fully deplete, so you can tap once for your skillup then let someone else get it.
---
 [https://xkcd.com/386/](https://xkcd.com/386/)

Cunningham's Law always works.
---
An add-on they use scans the AH almost constantly and build a database for the going rate of an item on a server. Then when something is errantly posted at 5% of its going rate, the add-on alerts the player to purchase the item for relisting.
---
If you’re dead set on getting a mount at 40, mining and selling iron or farming the fire elementals in ararthi work best.
---
Honestly though, the best thing to do is quit spending gold and quest like normal. You won’t have a mount at 40, but probably by 41-42 you will.
---
Right but for the first 30 something levels without any good gear it sucks
---
I mean it's entirely possible this is the old vanish bug creeping back. I remember it was a big deal when they patched it but I don't remember when it happened. It could also be a latency issue. Or a bug caused by a latency issue. I'd bug report it.
---
yea it will be a lot but worth it in the long run
---
Back in the day when I played wow retail (I stopped just after Cataclysm), there was this profile web page where I could see all my characters and their details. I can't find that back now. I'm pretty sure I should still have my characters from back then and I'd like to see without needing to install the game.
---
Is this still possible?
---
bingo bango
---
I feel like it’s not so much “horde” or “alliance” players as it is just people who can’t fight people their own level so they yank lowbies, I’ve been attack maybe 2-3 times by someone my own level and had an actually duel, most of the time it’s one shit by a 10+ level higher than  me rogue or camped by a alliance 60 who had nothing better to do
---
Haha I was gonna say, even I skipped Gnomer out of general distaste for that place!  We'd end up waiting around forever!
---
Arena spam was terrible exp when I did it at 53. You kill like 1 mob on the way then a few inside arena then reset.
---
Netfish and Chill
---
If your popping potions in world PVP you've already lost.
---
Yeah I really feel for the horde on Whitemane. I tried to start a petition to get them a world pvp buff so  they could actually stand a chance against someone who wasn't grey but I couldn't get the support for it. Maybe we could get some basic tutorials for them on how to play so they could feel more confident about fighting someone who has a chance to fight back.
---
I'm the same I "price to move" if somethings 100g I'll happily put mine up for 85 so it sells within the hour.
---
Imagine being this emotionally invested in something so trivial
---
Cast-&gt;put mouse over bobble-&gt;listen for sound
---
What a silly thing to be upset about.
---
Do you mean DM east? Not sure you can solo the other bosses in DM N other than the first.
---
I mean people in the NA have been doing it for years on private servers before classic. All the servers were Europe somewhere. Even with that, I was pinging 200-300 and couldn’t notice a major difference. I’d say give it a shot because I think it will be fine
---
Took me 23 runs before I saw ogre and he dropped the damn gloves
---
I can agree with this
---
So, on a similar note, i still have an unused burning crusade collectors edition with the unique pet code. Will that be usable when they rerelease BC?
---
I raided Naxx in vanilla up to 4H before my guild's leadership decided that Vanguard (lol) was going to be the WoWkiller and jumped ship.  I joined a different guild because I wanted to finish Naxx (especially since I had 40 splinters and wanted to complete Atiesh) and finished it with them.  
---
PvPwise I got to Knight-Captain which was rank 8 or 9 I believe.  
---
Ultimately, I don't think it matters.  Unless the Naxx fights on private servers were significantly different than they were on Vanilla servers it's not going to mean anything that I raided Naxx in vanilla.
---
like you really needed to advertise
---
we all know, dude
---
Just got all the pre-bis, don't have this issue anymore 🐻 
---
But as a mage, getting into groups seems easy as heck..
---
I would assume so!  After the initial race for mount money, both base and epic, I'm sure people will have more money to spend on alts/twinks etc.
---
This worked, thanks a lot!
---
He also has all the priest PI him instead of casters
---
Anddd I want to now switch back to my paladin..
---
Nah, it wasn't so bad. I stuck with sword and board mostly until 20 which helped, didn't die very much and did just fine. Then I switched to 2h axes for a while, especially when I got my ww axe at 30. If you can only find green weapons in the AH you just keep them within a level or two of your level, and you run dungeons starting around DM time and get yourself a decent blue and just wreck some face. The difficulty of a warrior is overblown. Sure, there are times where you are going slow and steady while the mage next to you is taking down whole groups, but on the up side you'll never want for a group, and people won't automatically assume you're a douche canoe.
---
was doing this the other day and someone came up right by me fishing on top of me so I couldn't tell which sound was which :(
---
True, also gotta worry about the priests dispelling the VW sac
---
....what?
---
Where to grind for gold specifically as an undergeared, freshly dinged Alliance Hunter with Minig?
---
Don’t believe so but you can bind your pet abilities to a key instead of clicking
---
I was pugged into it just last week.
---
Did you get an Ashbringer?
---
I bound it to mousewheelup but some people make macros so that your pet attacks whenever you start casting a particular spell
---
If you are running a shop and rely on small margins I don't blame you for getting bent over 40 silver. However there is no point attacking people in an open market. The prudent thing to do is pull out and then come back once prices recover (or cut your losses if they dont) Now if this guy is not running a shop and is upset over 40 silver undercut just for the principle, well then he is a special kind of loser.
---
If this is true I've met a lot of horde cowards on my server so far.
---
Macro /petattack
---
If you put a shield on you are just as tanky as a prot warrior. You're not losing any mitigation talents in the prot tree when you're FuryProt spec, only the parry talent in arms. I still wear a shield 80% of the time but there are fights where the fury warriors were pulling aggro or having to hold back, and having the flexibility to dw is really nice in those scenarios. FuryProt is also really good for onyxia especially.

I installed auctioneer and have made 50g in three days just selling the crap I used to vendor. You would be amazed at what people buy. My Hunter is only level 31 but I’ll have the 100g for my mount in a few more days with zero effort or stress.

It's a known fact that only 1% of the player base cleared Naxx back then.

It is a silly thing to be upset about.

If I was upset about it, that'd be silly.

I'm not upset. Just pointing out why it's a stupid thing to say.

If you were doing it at 53, you were either a rogue or pulling more than 1 fire elemental.

For things without ranks no. For things with ranks you have to rebuy them from the trainer

Really not in demand, because you only need 1 in a raid for the MotW buff and battle rez.

They didn't have passive, assist, aggressive, defensive pet options in vanilla? I could have sworn my warlock had a setting for each pet along the lines of: 1) do nothing but follow me around until I press a key bind telling it to attack or use an ability. 2) if I'm attacked, defend me, 3) if I attack or use a damage dealing spell, assist me on that target, 3) maybe, but can't remember, but attack anything aggressive within range. 
---
I always played with passive and had key binds for attack and any special abilities like felhound interrupt or vw sac, charm from succubus etc.
---
What an eye sore. Re-edit, repost, and try again.
---
Can you buy my whole guild epic mounts thnx.
---
I’m not complaining. It can get boring farming for gold, I’m always up for some pvp
---
Hillsbrad&gt;ashenvale (do BFD and quests)&gt;1k needles (do RFK and quests at 30)&gt; Desolace&gt;STV
---
i dropped a point of hit to get kings for this specific thing
---
Haven't seen that issue on Fairbanks, but don't competitively auction a lot. sorry to see that reaction, but I'm with you, just prices to sell.
---
Same, I was a raid leader ffs. I still forgot most of the encounters. It kind of comes back when I do it, but 15 years is a long time.
---
Lmao. I dont do that to strangers, but questing with a good friend in the barrens... we both need raptor horns, but after each kill we somehow aggro a hyena on his loot turn. Usually it's an accident but I'd be lying if I said that some weren't on purpose for the laughs.
---
You should read more about it, I read it all. There is absolutely nothing pointing to his involvement at all other than being a part of the company.
---
Honestly sounds like it, should have been glad they let you have your raid spot back
---
Ok bye bye
---
What do you mean guaranteed? its the same as mining any other node.
---
oh, I thought that was something only horde players did
---
Because no one else wants to play with you
---
each
---
What is that used for?
---
It’s literally all speculation/anecdotes. 
---
There was a census addon (which never had complete data in the first place) that went down maybe 3-4 weeks ago. This was an inaccurate snapshot in the first place, and that’s literally the only data people have to this day. (After numerous server transfers opening and closing, 3-4 weeks of people quitting/joining, etc.)
---
People have to realize that server balance is the “ELO hell” of WoW atm. It’s the catch-all excuse for anything that’s going wrong pvp-wise for alliance, and I’ve even seen Horde anecdotes of being “massively outnumbered” on certain pvp servers. 
---
I was getting so tired of hearing the whining about my servers terrible imbalance that I made a second account and leveled a warrior to 60 solo on alliance. I got my epic mount on that first and it’s basically my main now.
---
I can count on one hand the amount of times I was randomly ganked 1-58. It just didn’t happen. You have to be smart and adaptable though. 
---
Honestly it’s the people who see 2-3 horde in a small quest area and waltz in to kill mobs who are complaining. It’s the people who start pvp fights then die and get camped. It’s people who are so stubborn or uneducated that they’ll sit in a zone like a mule while getting wrecked for 3 days, when they could have been 10 levels higher had they just pivoted elsewhere or done dungeons.
---
My warrior got there in 7 days with literally no horde trouble until I got into EPL and such where pvp did occur (which I enjoy - this is important). And now that I have my epic mount and decent gear, it’s all worth it. On my horde I legit felt bad going out to pvp. There’s a feeling that you’re hurting the server by pvping (which sucks). On alliance, I can finally just hit felwood or winterspring and slaughter everyone with no reservations. I have unlimited targets and unlimited chances to improve. It’s so nice
---
&gt; , probably being the best Alliance tank option for raids in phase 1.
---
Threat isn't everything.
---
Taunts and strong defensive cooldowns are why Warriors are the best. Warriors can recover from raid screwups much better than Paladins.
---

BiS

How is this possible?  Either you are way over their level and practically twinked, or they're the worst players in history.
---
cooldowns maybe?
---
That’s what I do lol
---
I know most people of this subreddit haven’t been involved in a smaller company or a family ran business so it might be hard to understand why Tips has the position he has in the company. With Tips being in the “leadership” he just got a seat at the table, shares and a paycheck. You don’t bring in a kid in his twenties to make decisions in a multi million dollar company. You bring him in to be able to take out more money out of the company while paying less taxes than if you would have done it all yourself (tips dad). This is just to ensure that you can keep control of the company and milk it, this is what most people do. 
---
There is literally no fucking way that Tips in his twenties was brought in to the business and started scamming people, I honestly doubt he even knew what his father was up to. It’s not that fucking simple to figure out unless you’re actually told.
---
Best profession for a warrior alt alongside engineering? I already have mining/tailoring professions on other characters.
---
If I am trying to kill someone, it's because theres too many people in the area killing quest mobs.   You hearthing away is the best case scenario.
---
Yep
---
But is it BIS tho?
---
luckily, relearning talent spells is about 1/20 of the regular price.
---
DD?
---
Does wiping on trash for ours count?
---
I'm playing my third Druid and I'm up to 32 at the moment. Highest I'd gotten one before was 26. I find that I've grown so accustomed to being sneaky that I'm actually nervous to pick fights now. I feel very in control vs mobs, but find myself wanting to panic when I encounter players. I need to figure my shit out so I can be more like you.
---
Bucko is just the 25+ white person’s way of saying fucko.
---
They know how to make that gold.
---
Can’t play anymore - too popular
---
It strikes me how many characters I encounter in WoW are undead which leads me to wondering how many of them actually are undead. I personally don't care what race people play as, but I was just wondering.
---
Most people just prefer the female models, or maybe they don’t want to stare at male ass all day
---
Come play classic my man. I lost my interest hard about a month into legion but I've been back to hardcore addicted to classic!
---
If you want join the server kromcrush, alliance faction and PM me and I'll give you my blizzard username. You can join up with me and my friends. We are adults and veterans of the game.
---
Well its like i heard someone say back in vanilla days, "would you rather watch a dudes ass or a chicks for 60 levels". Atleast that was my justification in vanilla and now its just habit lol
---
Clearcasting does not scale with number of mobs hit. Casting blizzard on 200 mobs will still only have a 10% chance to proc clearcasting as would casting it on one mob.

Right. 48.5 is the raw half.

That's why people say 44 is half in terms of time
---
How do you mark a target with the floating arrow?
---
Haha! :D
---
half of mine are.
---
Just wait until you go oom in a raid and still need to heal.
---
I was playing classic, but there are just too many things ruining it for me, and I know that’s my deal, but still, it’s just where I am right now, thanks though 😊
---
I understand that argument
---
if this was a bot there wouldn't be 5 seconds between the post and the purchase. sniper is very quick. 5 seconds is a reasonable amount of time to identify a mistake and purchase an item.
---
&gt; Like, how about no, I did my shit on time, the people who slacked off shouldn't be getting another couple days to finish theirs.
---
If it doesn't impact you, why does it make you so upset?
---
I'm the same level as the warlock and other warrior lol
---
This time.
---
Millenials going cray cray sheesh
---
I'd leave the party if Eddie joined. Fucking hate that guy.
---
I swear, the stonescale eels are so cheap right now it's crazy.   They used to be very expensive in vanilla, because no one wanted to fish.   WTF is going on?
---
People have to be botting....
---
Pick orc
---
Wield axe
---
???
---
Abuse game mechanics
---
Master looter. Only they can loot and they will distribute the loot to others
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but Alliance had way more players in vanilla and the edge with PVE content with their racials ans blessing of kings.
---
uhh 15, 30, and 45 for wool, silk, runecloth and yes each one is like 16k exp per faction.
---
Or me just killing you when you and your friends go on me lol
---
Not against the rules to camp lowbies. Also not against the rules to fight unfairly.

---
Man, don't be too hard on him. On the other hand he likes that, so maybe keep going!? I'm confused
---
hypocrite loser
---
Yes homo
---
Ha! Yeah, I guess girls play as male characters too, but I think that would be less common.
---
Shattered Hall was pretty tough too.
---
Well I mean I would like to use swords as well, But I guess this community is just not for me with the way your coming off.
---
Why don’t you get a job?
---
Hunter range (41) is larger than grenade range (30). Rocket boots/helm can work if they don't backfire, boots aren't as effective though as you won't make up the gap if you're at his max range and hes got cheetah active when you use them. He could also have his own boots, or a swiftness pot.
---
Warriors are rocks, rogues are scissors, warlocks are mushrooms, and everyone else is paper
---
I’d suggest finding another hobby, but this is wow, and we all know other hobbies are non-existent 😂
---
I make each character with some sort of character type in mind so that decides the gender for me. I generally like female casting animations better too. I have a good mix of all races and both genders for my 4 or 5 toons.
---
Yes. 
---
Also how does a guild raid MC every other day?
---
You won't beat a good warlock. They counter you. They will fear you and rot you and there is not really anything that you can do about it other than run away
---
Not true at all... On fights you need a shield you're still getting hit hard enough to generate lots of rage to generate lots of threat. And you still didn't comment at all on why you think FuryProt tanks aren't as tanky as Deep Prot when wearing a shield?
---
i mean u didn't tell anyone what was going on so idk what you expected.
---
Plus people don't want to deal with other's baggage and your guild isn't a mental health support group, nobody signed up to deal with your problems.
---
Sounds harsh but if you're looking for validation, can't give it to you mate.
---
There's a reason they are called face melters.
---
That's why we need to come together as a community, and ask blizzard to allow an option be put into the game to report these people for griefing! This sh1t cannot stand!
---
why? i switched to ele at 40 and consistently lead dps charts and kill things while questing without them even touching me at lvl 50
---
&gt;	Your guild name is my SSID ~~name~~.
---
SSID means service set identifier.
---
If it's red it's dead !
---
As a tank, I love shadow priest cuz they bring extra tools to group, your strong point is that you can dispel magic and disease while dpsing. The only thing that you need to worry is your aggro, I dun think shadow priest has threat reduction built into shadowform.
---
&gt;HotW-NS
---
I'm using the Feral spec for leveling. Can you link me to the HotW-NS Spec? I'll check out that trinket and those other items.
---
why don’t you get a job?
---
Yeah, YTA
---
Sorry that you have depression, but you can't use that as an excuse for your actions afterwards. You inconvenienced your guild; and showed youself to be unreliable. They didn't immediately kick you, they gave you an opportunity to show that you were dependable. It sounds like you didn't accept that and threw it back in their face.
---
You need to probably take a break from the game, and calm down... Missing 2 weeks of raids isn't a huge deal; you could have just pugged anyway.
---
can't tell if serious, the random censoring is throwing me off.
---
It's the superior tanking spec with the content we have. Higher threat with the same tankiness (minus 4% armor) while shield is on.
---
The allies on my server camp players until they spirit ress and then coordinate with the rest of their guild to camp the graveyard and camp the players with res sickness
---
The only time I've ever been attacked by horde (on Blaumeux) is if they have a number advantage or if they were drastically higher level than me. Thank you for being better than the horde I've run into.
---
I kind of wish I had.   It seems like it's a far better experience devoid of a lot of the scum sucking trash from the pirated servers.
---
Or mages going ham right as you use an arrow to pull
---
It's like girls can't play video games without immediately attention seeking in the closest chat huh.
---
Blizzard needs to do nothing.
---
You picked a PVP server, thus you have accepted the consequences of a PVP server.
---
You got both PVE and RP servers if you want a smooth ride to level 60.
---
Why don’t you got a job?
---
Am I missing something?
---
As a horde on Whitemane I was actually killing people in Astranaar earlier today. 
---
But it was right next to a GY and high levels came to support very quickly!
---
Maybe they suck and only do 1 boss at a time?
---
Why?  That sword isn't even that good.  300 armor onna proc is meh.  And the speed is slow at 2.00 and the stats are trash.
---
I don't get it.
---
Thanks buckaroo! Shit, now I'm being too nice.
---
why don’t u get a job?
---
As much as I agree that it can be annoying, you have the option to play on a Pve server.
---
calm down dad
---
Ragnaros is hard enough that most guilds can't afford to sit out melee DPS.
---
Shazzrah is easy.
---
Can I ask what the item is used for?
---
Layers are gone. Sorry bud.
---
I had heard that it was a guaranteed one.
---
If we're being fair that's more than likely. Armor still looks way more aesthetically pleasing on a male character in my opinion.
---
Let's wish for faction changes!
---
Gimme them downvotes because I still want it!
---
Thank you! That is exactly what I need!!!!
---
I’ve kinda stopped commenting on the wow subreddit but...
---
Is this not the realest thing you’ve ever seen? The dude even fucking bossed it I was so hype but I didn’t expect him to succeed.
---
My friends, we’ve just witnessed the second Warcraft movie.
---
This should make the Gurubashi Arena a lot eaier.
---
Every 3 hours like clockwork they are exactly where i am. They must be stalking me!! They are griefing me, harassing me and stopping me from progressing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ban now.
---
show me your spec then
---
i'm sure you already know exactly what's wrong with this picture. you just enjoy spreading misinformation
---
I don't understand what your guild is upset about or why you have to sit out raid resets? You were gone temporarily, and now you're back; either they want to raid with you or they don't, but I don't know why they would feel any differently about you now.
---
Lacking further information, they seem like assholes.
---
Na, most of us aren't elitist min/maxer assholes and realize you can have fun playing what you want and still be viable doing anything. We have some in our raid comp and they do just fine
---
Blizzard did do something about it, they're called pve servers
---
Hello,
---
I have spent a lot of time pickpocketing in brd until I earned my epic mount.
---
Yes , most of the time vanish doesn’t work. Even if you stayed still or walking. I died so much in brd.
---
 If you are unlucky, u can’t even pickpocket as every mob you have pickpocket resist. It’s so annoying.
---
Mmmm, and on a btw too. Feelsgood man
---
Saying words like should
---
Tell me that this isnt a rhetorical thread
---
And you want devs to patch that in and change classic that was never apart of classic or any expansion
---
And if that's the case....tough.
---
On all my characters? No
---
If you're going to be more than a Disenchanter, you'll need to be out there in the market selling enchants - and while you're doing that, you're not playing your main.
---
Enchanting is go hard or go home. On an alt, I'd stick with disenchanting.
---
You just need the costume.  The animations are really simple for the skelly so you can bug them just by strafing then going backwards.   When you change directions it gets stuck in the last animation.
---
Honestly I hated Loatheb.  We'd go in there and do five or six attempts, clear the trash out, and grab every world buff possible as quickly as possible and then kill it,  you fuck up? That's it for 6 hours because you need a nef/ony head.
---
So much rage happened while we learned the fight
---
Nah. I'm better
---
Do you have any add-ons?  There's all sorts of things you can use to help improve your gameplay!
---
This.
---
Prestige, and it being one of the best preraid weapons that you can pay for, not relying on personal RNG to get.
---
Not Hardee's biscuits
---
I leveled 52 to 55 (current level) just jumping on any kind of brd run I could find. Started tanking it at 53, and it really gives great experience. You get the quests as you go along and hopefully some gear drops. But as a warrior, it’s definitely more efficient than solo questing, and much less boring.
---
[1. General][Uzicle]: LF3M SM ARMORY need dps + TANK and Heal
---
My point is it's certainly doable in phase 1 with current gear. This buffing trick has no path to scaling and warrior tank damage is just going to continue to rise with gear.
---
Tremor totem doesn’t work. Most shamans think tremor totem is what is needed for sleep. So if they are unfamiliar with the fight they use that. Tremor won’t work. But the boss casts a single target spell. So grounding totem does. And keeping it up instead of windfury is easy.
---
&gt; It's not ruining a pvp server... 
---
100% ruining the experience for everyone else they encounter. It's like 1 in a 1000 players too.  It would be so ez to just ban these losers, and improve the game for basically everyone else.   Blizzard would retain far more subs, than they lost by losing these idiots too.
---
You're right, I dont. I dont watch streamers too often but the occasional time I did watch him, he seems pretty cool. Maybe 10 times tops, so maybe I happened to catch him on good days.
---
Lol get fuck!ng wrecked
---
Pass.
---
No idea. Might be worth trying, but giving the tank bop will make the boss melee someone else. And if you cast it after the boss starts casting the sleep, the tank will get hit with it anyway. 
---
The fight is doable with a decent group without a shaman. But horde have it very easy compared to alliance due to grounding totem.
---
You're wanting to utilise sweeping strikes, but you're dual weilding. What's your plan for the 5 attacks? Most will get eaten with white swings.
---
Wouldn't even attempt to use this, not even taking 5/5 Flurru
---
He could have bought urs and resold then...
---
You forgot the part where you need to be in a dedicated pre-made group of GM wanna be who will take turn to reach r14. Also supported by good pvpers who are happy with just r12-13.
---
You can’t grind r14 without a pre-made.
---
Man, I’m lucky to get 1s for either Firefin or oily.
---
Lol get fuck!ng downvoted!
---
Your whining makes me want to camp you
---
Skinning is pretty good for getting you your first mount via vendoring/AH the skins. After you have enough for your 40 mount I would drop skinning and go herbalism because the mats for raiding potions seem to be more time-effective for making gold.   
---
I went tailoring/enchanting so I could level my enchanting quickly. Definitely regret not having a gathering profession as both Tailoring/Enchanting are costly to level. Planning to drop tailoring for either Herbalism/Engineering once I craft Robes of the Archmagus
---
Keep it up. I just got mine today on run 138. Worst part was a streak of 39 runs without seeing Gorosh once. You’ll feel so good when you finish though. Make sure to bring no competition, it’s an easy 3 man with a 60 mage and a decent healer.
---
I mean, dude isn't wrong. They will sell just fine with a copper undercut. If you play the auction long enough everyone sees that. You're only cheating yourself out of profit, and screwing over everyone else. Personally if it's a large undercut I'll just buy them out, but 40 silver in classic can be a big deal.
---
Nah, I totally knew a guy.... ;)
---
You think a guild of 40 60’s (one being a ret pally) is going to pug over a member?   Or drop that faithful member 3 weeks in because they found someone better?  Maybe in your guild you don’t care about the people behind the keyboard, but that isn’t every guild.  Is just as disingenuous to say that they won’t ever find a raid.
---
I’ve raided with ret pallies, boomkin, and shadow priests.  Was a paladin tank through aq40 and into naxx trash.   If you look, you’ll find a group of people who want to take you in pretty much whatever meme spec you want, just as people will pug a 57 because they need a healer.  Or pick up a random boomkin outside the instance because you need to fill a spot (same raid btw).
---
Healing. Touch. Wtf with rejuvenating spamming.

They're so very, very, very, very unimaginative
---
you're done arguing because you don't have deflection, imp heroic strike, shield slam, and improved sunder armor and have proven my exact point
---
on fights where you need to put on a shield, a full prot warrior will utterly dominate you in threat AND mitigation
---
Fade is not holy so they do.
---
Normally you will only use two weapons of the same type to take advantage of weapon specialisation. 
---
If you have sworn specialisation and use MH sword and OH dagger, sure you get more poison price because your dagger may be slightly faster, but you end up losing damage because your OH sword can also proc sword spec ... swing twice .. and that second swing has its own separate crit chance and poison proc chance.
---
People use swords because of sword spec and double swings for aforementioned reason. Another reason is that your sinister strikes do more damage with a slow high damage MH.
---
Mace spec causes stuns. Not terrible in PvE but most of the time it is best not to stun mobs so that tank can gain more rage, stuns don't also work on a lot of bosses. Maces can be very nice in PvP though (still not the main choice, I think makes were more popular in TBC though)
---
Daggers are used in PvE (raids and dungeons). And I believe they can even out damage combat swords. Because you can spam backstab with the mob focused on the tank.
---
I should have known that. Not sure why I didn't remember it. Thanks though.
---
Do you ever log off? Sad
---
I have two level 50s. I haven’t picked one to main, I just swap between them so I don’t get burnt out on one character.
---
Just open with deathcoil &gt; dot &gt; fear &gt; dot &gt; SB and they’re usually pretty close to being dead
---
I mean.... the point of posting on the AH is to make money, why would you spit on 40s ? Just let an addon undercut for you if you're going to post on the AH, or do it yourself but otherwise it's counterproductive. I'm never going to /w random dudes but I wish people were smarter. Your shit will sell, so take the 40s.
---
Living outside Orgrimmar dueling throughout vanilla, the  unpredictable aspect was RNG resists/crits. Yeah you need to react to things, but the options people had were limited so you knew what your opponent was going to do.
---
See the duel tournament for reference, "when rogue does X, you need to do Y, rogue will then be forced to do Z"
---
with 23g you seem to be on the right track! I made 60 gold while purely farming for gold between the levels of 38-40. I would keep what you have since they level nicely together but then again I don't like farming for mats that much
---
I'm sorry I posted a video that offended you?
---
Goal wasn't to kill Thrall, we already killed their other faction leaders an hour earlier. We wished to leave horde with a single leader to rally around, in hopes it might drive them into enough of a frenzy to put up a fight. 
---
It seems to have worked.
---
Say that it really was an upgrade though.
---
Say that you just killed emperor in BRD and guiding staff of wisdom drops https://classicdb.ch/?item=11932
---
The warrior still has bone biter from the SM quest, and the staff is a dps upgrade.
---
Does the warrior get to roll in this weird contrived situation? Or it it more nuanced than “upgrades are upgrades?”
---
That's incorrect. It does not apply the same.

Do you just assume my chars gender ?

I have yet to meet a single person in game who didn't play Vanilla hard core and is a subject matter expert on every single aspect of Vanilla.  
---
I've tried 3 guilds so far, all of them full of supposed super hard core Vanilla players who are right about all aspects of the game and you can't tell them any differently.
---
The amount of times I read guild chats and want to type "suuuure buddy, whatever you say" as I roll my eyes has been too damn high. 
---
I'm currently guildless and freshly rerolled on a new server, thinking of just joining a casual leveling guild.
---
Almost the same exact story except I was an off tank in half nature, half frost resist gear and it was only one pull. I whispered the OT and admitted it to him because I was scared of the MT lmao. Oh memories...I’d forgotten and thinking of it now makes me happy even though it sucked that day :)
---
Such an oversimplification when you have 9 classes with 3 talent trees.  
---
How many hard counters does really exist?
---
Don't use the bleed. It's a waste of energy comparative to just clawing from the front. Rip should be the only bleed you're using. If you have the extra combo point on crit talent, then use a finisher at 4-5CP, because if you crit at 4 cp you'll waste a cp
---
I'm not offended, you said you were a competitive dota 2 player so I got interested
---
Build a shadow resist set solely for dealing with warlocks and shadow priests. That's all you can do.

I had to redo 3rd year because I was raising ICC HM on two toons so I completely understand...

you're pulling your "facts" out of your ass. either you never actually played vanilla or you're just dumb. i can't really tell which

&gt; it's a lot more fun for everyone.

again. speak for yourself

I know for warlocks, it’s roughly 1% ~= 15 dmg. I would imagine slightly less for mages

I’m into guys and would much rather that. But female models look better

Okay, it's more fun for 99.99% of people.   The remainder gets banned, and has to go back to the cancerous pirate realms.  Fuck'em.
---
Had the same mindset, had to raid for gear but I looked down upon PvErs.    
---
\-They couldn't beat me in duels, so they were bad at the game  
---
\-Nerds who spent hours grinding just to "not stand in the fire" for more hours  
---
\-I had to be dragged through these hours just to hear people epeening about heal/threat/dpsmeters.  
---
\-I wanted to stomp on people, they were stomping on NPCs.
---
Mix in some teenage inferiority complex and there was 15 year old douchebag me.
---
I know, I’m saying you can’t bash a lock if he opens with death coil
---
lol crushing blows and crits are a 2005 meme. only trash guilds gear for defense.
---
paladins are shitty because of trash single target threat and no taunt.
---
Have you ever heard the words I love you?
---
Can hunters turn the blue sinew in at a later date for the backpack? Or can it only be done at the same time as the rest?
---
Good mage will annihilate a hunter. Warlocks are brutal though, and if they're soul link with a felhunter you may as well not even bother.
---
I remember back in vanilla a female guildie of mine played male and said "he got sexy ass"
---
I was in my first MC the other day at lvl 58, raidleader pleaded everyone to turn off their DPS meters saying that doesn't matter as long as we kill the things we're supposed to kill. Strangely enough, a great, non-toxic raid ensued!
---
Oh weak, I thought you could do it for your normal character. That does sound like how you used to do it, though.
---
Tailoring is worth it for the Robe alone. I looked up a guide and skilled tailoring 1-300 and the robe  of the archmage for about 650 gold. After that I unlearned tailoring
---
Player versus player. It sure is man.
---
AH get a cut from all buys. you pay the full price but the seller receive less. for the buyer changes nothing but the seller loses a lot of gold depending on what you are selling. usually what ppl sell in WC are high valuables to makes perfect sense.
---
I have literally never touched private servers and that’s a really random and unrelated assumption to make
---
not sure what's funny, you're essentially asking to buff shamans, who are unique to horde until TBC. Who also heavily outweigh the value of Paladins until later phases when gear stats allow blessing of kings to scale enough to be superior. 
---
Incredible raid healers, incredible dps, highly versatile resto/ele hybrid PvP, and so on. They aren't meant to tank. In lower level dungeons you can get away with it. 
---
Hero
---
I mean...he’s right in a way. Some people really do screw up the economy with this kinda crap. If you’re only posting a couple at that price, cool. But if you put up 20 at that price, yeah, you’ve set the “new price” and messed up the economy for all other sellers.
---
Ya dun goofed
---
servers are still new so inflation hasn't set in and people haven't been able to stockpile gold yet.
---
Right now the only good money-making methods are selling in-demand services to other players or by selling tons of vendor trash like greys, cloth, green weapons, and boss drops.
---
Once the mages have had 1~2 more months to farm the shit out of SM cath you'll start seeing other gold making methods like fishing and mining make more than like 10~15g an hour.
---
Hell, on my server savory deviate delights are finally up to like 25s a piece
---
Female, but my toon is male.   As a tank, I like the giant hit box on the male Tauren.  Positioning mobs seems easier.
---
NGL it is frustrating when people make huge undercut jumps though, it tanks the market fast.
---
just about all i remember about vanilla is that i tanked a boss with my lock in shadow resist gear.... i don't even remember the bosses name, or what instance it was in.... my previous 'experience' is totally useless
---
I'm more annoyed by people selling shit for vendor price on the AH. Like what's the fucking point.
---
Its....the same time?
---
well is there a sub for min/maxing in classic?
---
I'm not sure about him in specific, but tons of people thought it'd be boring and no one would play it.
---
I've been annoyed by undercuts before, usually when things are going for 300g and someone decides to undercut and take it to 200g. However this is nuts! Such a non issue, and he could just buy it out himself as others have said.
---
General mage counters are warlock, priest, druid and shaman. 
---
The vs rogue matchup is as close as it gets to 50/50 and depends highly on skill, spec and consumables. Mage maybe has a tiny edge, but nothing significant. 
---
In battlegrounds and general group PvP hunters wreck mage. Solo PvP mage absolutely destroys them if they really know what they're doing
---
&lt;shrug&gt; looks like money to me
---
If you take 1 point for it, other druids which are 0/3 won't be able to override your Rejuvs.
---
Atleast you don’t have 4 level 30-35s like some people I see posting on this sub haha

That’s hilarious

Where did this dad meme start? It’s pretty funny and I’ve been seeing it a lot lately
---
This is a normal day for Kazuma Kiryu
---
Fairbanks is full of some real fuckhead.  There's quite a few infamous guilds that I just refuse to interact with because they seem to attract the worst type of people
---
I thought the commentary was pretty funny.
---
No, but no one wants to carry you, either. If you want to be in a raid where the other 39 people are putting in effort and playing to the best of their abilities, then you have to play to the best of your abilities.
---
It's so dumb. Why the fuck don't alliance players join in? Hell I join in even if they are higher level. It's the right thing to do, even if you die. There is no way anyone is to busy. Even on more balanced PvP servers it feels imbalanced because the alliance don't get off their asses and help. 
---
I'm almost 60 and when I am, I will be patrolling leveling zones and helping anyone getting ganked. It was not always this way and if enough people start joining in it hopefully won't remain this way.
---
Until PVP trinket, good luck
---
I just watched all 4 videos you posted and I still have no idea what I just watched. Can you please explain to me what it is you are saying. It seems like no point is made in your examples other than some emotional response clips.
---
My original belf pally from tbc was male with the foxtail haircut and red hair. My classic pally is a female human with a pony tail and red hair. I’m a male ginger but my hair is short. I didn’t like the male cast animations
---
Tells it like it is
---
Sounds like a lot of effort for little payoff. You can keep undercutting until you tank the market. Then once the market is tanked, buy all the substantially marked down items and post bits of it at a substantial mark-up, effectively resforing the original market price with you having a large supply, setting the base price, and with very little competition
---
Just dead inside
---
Just wait til phase 2 and then eventually 3, those same people will be getting a boner whenever they see a shadow priest in their group.
---
Our guild uses one. We clear MC/Ony every week. We also have an enhance shaman. Nobody in the guild cares if you bring consumables (that will change come aq40 though), it's literally the most laid back guild. They are also all in discord all the time which is great.
---
I see you are a man of culture. Sesume!!

My friend got a bunch of designer clothing names for characters to make purple shirts. We decided on Couture but my favorite was Farragama. We weren’t sure how many people in the fam would recognize that tie designer
---
The real top comment
---
Everyone is also rich as fuck now. Feel like everybody I know who’s already farmed their prebis and epic mount is sitting on 1-4K gold.
---
LOL
---
Warriors have thunder clap, Druids have Swipe, Paladins have Consecration.
---
What the hell happened here?
---
they're actually edgy 14 year olds
---
r/theydidthemath
---
But he's right tho...
---
I really like them I don’t think they fit into the meme spec category but most raids would never take more than 1.
---
5g on mine but made by "Calvin Klein"
---
Pure dps wise, keep the frozen wrath on. It is very slightly better in terms of overall spellpower (about 4 extra after factoring in the crit from the int on netherwind)
---
Overall, probably use the netherwind anyway, since the larger mana pool/health pool give you a lot more leeway to either be greedy with not spending globals on things like barrier/fire ward, and potentially not having to cast evocate, although that's unlikely since MC fights are so short. Also epic items are cooler than greens
---
Don't listen to old mate though, frost spell power and normal spellpower are exactly the same as far as coefficients are concerned, don't know where on earth he got the idea that frost spellpower ignores coeffiecients for frost spells
---
uhm wasn’t that his dad?
---
Under rated truth
---
I raid as Shadow priest and this content I can still do top DPS. I just need to keep in mind that raids will only have one spot for Shadow priest and thus you really need to shine. Keep in mind that you are the support class and often raid might put you to dispell stuff. Like on Shazzrah I spend 100% dispelling as I can't DPS with the low range of mind flay.
---
Lol dirka was such a dick. 
---
How dare people have fun on a game, what's wrong with you boat guy?!
---
It already couldnt tank most raid shit with these changes because it has no mitigation from some source. It has no shield, its not plate, it isnt a bear with the steroids in both the form and tree. 
---
  So yah it could hold multi targets but it would be tremendously squishy. If the idea was to make this a tank youd need to rework talents or add a stance similar to druids bear form because it would not surive anything.
---
  Im assuming that this change would really just make it a more prominent melee dps option but honestly shamans dont need changes in this department. They are super versatile and their weaknesses are bedded in the inconsistency or rng of certain mechanics, and the vast utility options it has. no real  on demand mobility is also huge. Like imagine if ghost wolf operated like druid travel form, shaman would be even more of a powerhouse in bgs.
---
All in all like I said with the previous post. I get the theme and ideas but while it may not seem drastic to you at first glance I think its quite obvious changes like these come with a mountain of implications that change gameplay in multiple facets.
---
Doesnt really work. Has there even been maintenance that lasted longer than 5 mins from release? Normally I can login 5-10 mim after server down
---
Yes. But I think they have to gen aggro from a heal or something. So kite mobs towards them, when you "lose" them sometimes they will run back to the person inbetween them and the spot you pulled it from
---
 
---
First time playing mage and have just gotten to level 50 as a single target frost mage. I haven't run dungeons much but when I have I've basically just spammed frostbolt and only used AOE spells on non-elite trash mobs.
---
In reading all of this stuff about spell cleave groups, I was wondering should I be using AOE spells on every pull in dungeons to maximize damage? Or is that only if I'm in a spell cleave group and not a regular PUG?
---
I’m so proud of you! Moonkins have it hard to find a mate, for obvious reasons. That’s why their numbers have been going down recently.
---
I was going to sub for $5, but this other guy only wanted $4.60. How DARE he charge so little!?!?!

no fish i get they wont sell

---
On whitemane horde. What dungeon do you want me to camp?
---
wow! it's my goal too ! grats .
---
ye cept not everyone is you.
---
i get msgd constantly for food/water and portals. and most of em arnt so kind (read: outright rude)
---
ive told em as nicely as i could that i was busy (i was once invited by someone while flying across the barens and when i declined it he told me go to fuck myself because i wouldnt make him a portal, i couldnt make. he insta put me on ignore lul)and ive been insulted in as many ways as you could imagine. i report em and i move on. (this is why ive stopped responseding to people, so if youve ever msgd a mage and they didnt answer. they were prolly there. they just tabbed out or some shit so they didnt have to deal with you)
---
but the fact so many ppl do it, is the problem.
---
maybe your a nice guy, and maybe you only hang out with nice people. but i can tell you this. not everyone is like you
---
also expecting mages to give you shit for free or at a low low price is entitled. expecting to be compensated in a fair manor for your time isnt entitled. (thats something you are entitled TOO. its not the same thing as being entitled. ones an adjective and the others a verb)
---
if people bought water for a competitive price (to the argent dawn) youd have 100s of mages trying to sell it, and then the prices would drop naturally. down to say 1g per 4stacks or something. but because people instantly want too drive the price down there and lower, alot of mages dont give a shit.
---
it just so happens that there are alot of mages. we are one of the most played classes so your bound to find some bright eyed mage that just wants to please everyone. but mark my words. almost every single mage gets fed up with the bullshit and thats when shit changes.
---
so if you know some nice mages id advice you shelter them from the outside world else they'll be as salty as me and my kind.
---
they undercut by large margin and dump all theyve got for cheapo price, this is a good method to make professions die
---
I’m a lvl 60 holy pally. Wanted to start some shit in hillsbrad so I ran up to alterac and found a 58 shaman. Seemed like a fair fight. Camped him for 2-3 kills and nobody came to help so I asked in general chat if any girder were causing problems and joined some 30s Nd started clearing out the hordes in their early 40s around the ogres. I wasn’t really camping but they kept picking fights so I stuck around
---
I reject your reality and substitute my own
---
I guess I just manually controlled my pet in vanilla, then. It was probably 2nd nature to hit ctrl 1
---
You know its fake.  Who the hell gets so mad they try and shove a remote up their ass?
---
Damn horde player here who fucks with ally all the time.  
---
You went off kudos to you!
---
You could give me money i wouldnt play with those shitty streamers😂. I am tanking mc actually and died only a few times plus we clesr mc in approx. 1,5hrs.... and our guild leaders didn‘t start recruiting 2 yrs ago😂
---
Ice Barrier is just amazing. It allows you to constantly face-tank mobs without taking health damage while grinding, and relieves a lot of healers' stress in dungeons/raids.
---
Thanks for the advice! I just farmed elementals for a couple hours tonight, got a blue boe worth 15g and 6 elemental fires, and dinged 38. So I'm only short like 5g already, I'll definitely have it by 40. 
---
I do really need gear upgrades though since I've only been questing, so I'll still probably do SM for a few levels  so I can get some gear for the 40-50 grind. I'm feral with all stam/str/agi gear so I should be set to tank.
---
But as a paladin I want you to cheetah. Every hunter does it and then you just hit them and then they never escape ^_^
---
I'm an anarchist as well, i undercut just to create chaos.
---
How much gold do you spend on water? Still on the fence about going ele.
---
I actually bought a good few stacks of coal the other day below vendor price. I dont think whoever listed them knew what the vendor price was, or just how much they sold for from the mining supplier. Though ive seen the opposite and seen people list stacks of them at around 10s/each who ALSO probably didnt know about that either.
---
Depends on the dungeon I leveled 44-50 healing zf zombie farms with 3-4 ravager warriors and it was fun. Actually did some strat live runs with 4 warriors last night and it went really well. Super fast no wipes. Kept me on my toes and got to practice my micro for pvp
---
How much threat do the other greater blessings do?
---
Is it equal to kings or significantly lower?
---
I've been so nice in this game recently...can't bring myself to fight anyone...love Tauren, Trolls are cool, Orcs got a bad rap due to the whole demon blood thing in Warcraft lore....however the Undead are assholes...lol
---
Thanks for the advice! I actually did a couple hours tonight and got 6 elemental fires and a blue BoE dagger worth 15. So I should only be about 5g away now after selling everything, and I also dinged 38 in the process.
---
Does he still play?
---
I Guess westfall is Canada then. Because the guy in the post is the least toxic, toxic player iv seen ^^
---
We had to heal first mc's with 6 healers including garr where we had 2 warlocks. The mana consumable use was pretty painful.
---
An &gt;10 weaponskill-target defense will cause massive penalties to attacks. Bosses have 315 defense. The penalty is -1% hit rating, an additional 2% hit rating required, and a 25% damage penalty on glancing blows (15% vs 40%)z As an orc you’re good with axes and meet this requirement. Obsidian edged blade is the only 2h sword you should use in PvE. Get edgemasters if u want to use swords. There’s def longer guides on this weapon skill thing. 
---
In short: 
---
300 WS
---
Requires 9% hit to be hit capped on bosses
---
40% glancing blow penalty
---
Higher enemy dodge block parry
---
305 WS
---
Requires 6% hit to be hit capped on bosses
---
15% glancing blow penalty
---
Slightly lower enemy dodge block parry 
---
Devil and TS is great for getting capped :)))
---
Scarlet monastery I’m in felwood right now let’s take a picture lol
---
The sunflower water does 4400 mana and a spirit buff but it’s expensive
---
Do you have any idea what 17% less dps on our arena spam is going to do to our efficiency?
---
If you're planning on wearing SGC then arena is worth it since you're going to have to run it anyway, might as well do it before 60. And if you're going to have casters in your group they will want to do arena since they don't get anything from angerforge.

If you farm orbs on your own you give them to guild bank?
---
I specced into axes when i was about your lvl, but wore all kinds of weapons afterwards. Im lvl 55 now and wear the 2hand mace dropped by princess in maraudon, still being specced into axes.
---
So basically, points wont matter that much because hunting for 1 special item while leveling isnt efficient... just a waste of money
---
Yeah absolutely, if they are needed I usually get a kick back from the people using them
---
This comment chain is a snap shot of proof in the horde bias and typical mentality.
---
I was farming SFK yesterday and had a bag of greens with desirable stat combos. As I caught the Zep from UC to Org a lvl 12 mage in greys gave me and everyone else on the Zep AI. I’m a 60 warrior, but really appreciate when lowbies buff me as it shows they want to be helpful.
---
Guess who got a set of greens cloths, wand and an 8 slot bag haha.
---
Dude, it barely matters what spec a Paladin or druid is until you get past MC. You can easily go to MC with more than one boomkin or a ret. People don't because of trying to get record times, forgetting that it's an easy intro raid essentially. I mean people pug MC at 58 sometimes. And these "meme specs" do fine in five mans. You're not cool for min/maxing scholo or strat. No offense.
---
As a horde player on Whitemane it happens both ways. I cant wait till phase 2 when dishonorable kills help this from happening less.
---
&gt; he never decursed and then get mad at his chat and say "im sorry i did so much dps!".  
---
Holy shit if I pointed out someone didn't decurse and they said that I'd kick them out in a heartbeat.
---
They don't talk about greater fire prots.
---
I bought a freezing band on Skeram alliance server for 50g. whoever it was messed up the extra 0 lol.
---
If you're a clicker in this game, you're not as good as you could be, it's just a fact.
---
eh, maybe if you already have a lot of rage and start off with high health, then  and you pop SS, spam cleave you might come out of it. Would probably need a pot and maybe even 1-2 other CDs. Thats why I'm saying 30-50%
---
I hate fighting pallies because you know LoH is coming and it's gonna punch you in the dick.
---
I think overall people get annoyed when a lot of people are doing it and the economy goes to shit. On Pagle, people kept dumping shit on the AH priced at what it costs to vendor them. Buying and relisting wasn’t effective either as people just kept posting at vendor price (which if that’s your plan, just vendor it and not LOSE money in the process, idiots). It took several weeks for the economy to recover and is still is having a hard time after the surge of casuals left the game. 
---
Some of us were trying to make an epic mount and the amount of people posting things for WAY too cheap definitely hurt that. Like others have suggested you can buy and flip, which I do but the sheer volume of insanely underpriced items made that very difficult out the gate.
---
Yeah I've read about Mages vs Warriors. It's seems odd to even make it that uneven.
---
All gets turned around I have gold it doesn't really hurt me but I'd rather people have enchants and stuff. Also helps a spriest get gear over the people who don't help at all
---
This is just stupid. IF the game is going to progress beyond classic they are just going to progress it the same way they currently have planned. They will release all vanilla content, then move on to TBC. 
---
The idea that blizz is going to make any class changes or talents it's a dumb fantasy
---
Grom Gol should be on the list as well
---
That's funny I dont even bother attacking 60 alliance warriors since it's not fun when your opponent doesn't stand a chance.
---
So badly.. automated buying for sure shouldnt be legal
---
Later expansions get some light on it I guess but then again only with class campaign characters I guess 
---
Then again warlocks are about enslaving demons 
---
They are contra demons mostly 
---
But I guess no one would like them in lore but they aren’t seen as major villains if they behave is what I think
---
We clearly need some new content releases if this is what the sub has become
---
There was good game design in the dark ancient times of 2004.
---
Yeah, my friend is a shadow priest, and he is always laughing about wrecking pallies. Just mana burns them to death.
---
As a hunter, it takes so gd long to kill one who is actually good. Cant mana drain them, so I normally use an approach of outlasting them by trapping and eating/drinking when their bubble is down

Depends on the class. As a hunter, I can mana drain them pretty well. I just have to avoid getting hit by a mind blast.
---
Calm down. You have chosen a PvP server, so deal with it. Get you lvl 60 friends to help you. If you don't have any switch zone or log to an alt.
---
Just becaue you dont see it does'nt mean it's not happening.
---
I see you're problem, you don't have a mage
---
well I have generated aggro just by having some fuck face run by me with aggro to leash distance for mobs and nearly died... so just drag mobs on to some poor asshole and they will likely get aggro in my experience.
---
I play meepo and invoker with 7k mmr in dota 2. How I play is irrelevant lol.
---
Sounds nice, would like to try it out
---
Chance is independent of PPM. You can hit 7 times in one minute and none in the next. 7 PPM is an average. The reason slower weapons are better is because of the 70% of weapon damage it does.The average of 7 PPM stays the same but your procs do more damage because slower weapons generally have a higher AP
---
You don’t Beat them with their playstyle. Druids and paladins have a different playstyle than most other classes in PvP.
---
If you’re feared don’t run back, use it to run away get out of fight drink reengage and so on...
---
Don’t look at the auction house until you’re 60. Don’t buy any gear, you don’t need it. The only exception to not buying anything is the handful of quest items that are easier to buy on the AH. And even then, don’t buy them if they’re too expensive.
---
I play as a female in wow almost exclusively. Unless I roll a dwarf, or on rare occasions orc and tauren 
---
I just like the females animations better and in my logic if I'm smaller in pvp I might not be spotted as quickly. Probably not true because of the bright nameplates floating overhead but it made sense to 14 year old me and I just got into the habit of playing female toons
---
do you manage your Questie through the Twitch app?  If not, that's the easiest way (that I've found) to find and mange add-ons that wasn't available back in the day.  There are plenty of class-specific ones you can search for, but just a few basics I use:
---
Atlas Loot - shows mob/dungeon loot
---
Auctioneer - scans and shows current AH values
---
Real Mob Health - displays numerical health values for accuracy
---
Spartan UI *or* Titan Panel Classic - customizable interface
---
If you need help or suggestions, feel free to PM me - I'll be happy to walk you through it!
---
i dont notice it being a hinderance, i highly recommend switching, i dont drink for like 8-10 pulls on solo and 6-8 in dungeons. elemental mastery grants 1 free spell with 100% crit chance on a 3 minute cd. and i cant remember the talent but there is one in elemental thats gives you a 20% chance on cast for next spell to cost nothing, clarification i think??? im not too sure.
---
a typical pull for me goes 3 highest rank thunderbolts, one earth shock, then melee the rest with rock biter on (usually less than 30% health). sometimes u get a free spell after earth shock too, either save it for next mob or use it again on current mob. all this takes about 20% of my mana and during melee phase i regain roughly 5% back so thats a grand total of ~15% mana used per pull.
---
Can a level 5 with lvl 1 enchanting disenchant any BoE item?
---
If you ever feel like rolling a druid, make sure to get the addon called druid mana bar or something along those lines. It adds a mana bar display no matter what form you're in, so you won't be caught standing around as a bone dry nelf/tauren while you're powershifting.
---
I completely forgot Boomkins are a thing
---
It's not STV if there aren't 60s camping it
---
As a horde on whitemane...... I agree
---
Just to add a qualification here, if you are a human or orc and use your respective racial weapons (swords/maces, or axes for orcs) you end up with 305 skill which means you only need 6% to always hit with yellow attacks. The white miss chance is over 20% so you'll never stack that out. Just hit 6. More is good but 6 is the soft cap
---
Keep aggressively undercutting to bring the overall price down while it ain't moving. Before it hits the weekend when the demand is higher, snap all those cheap juiceboxes up and post some for twice the original higher price, thus bringing the market up during a higher demand. Keep on sucking :)
---
Mining is basically gambling. Last few weeks I got maybe 3 arcane crystals in hundreds and hundreds of ore. This last week I think I’ve gotten 15 arcane sand 5 sapphires in 3-400 ore. High highs and low lows.
---
No.
---
That's literally the fun. Dot dot and run
---
Female always
---
My point was that if u have to wait for the healer to drink anyway you may as well clear packs faster with aoe then drink with healer.
---
Shortlyn after hitting 60 I got a mana lightning cord from a pug MC. A few weeks later sash of mercy dropped for me. I was tempted to equip it but I am very glad I didn’t. It’s considered BIS but I believe the crit is more valuable as a Paladin
---
I didn't even know the VoIP worked in classic
---
That’s 31 days worth of spawn time. Wtf.
---
.. but you can only do 5 every hour?
---
Within WoW system settings do you have the FPS hardcapped? Disable for both windowed and full screen, maybe your system thinks you’re tabbed out of the game since you’re using more than one screen
---
so the drop rate from bosses and tomes is 0.02% drop rate... so you could farm that book for the next year... or you could keep checking the AH and farm gold to see if it gets posted for 1-2k now like it was on our server and our guild bought it instantly. 
---
Feel free to farm, but I would pick up mining and do jump runs in DM East to get the rich thorium veins and farm gems to sell for gold on the AH and make sure you keep a fat stack of cash on hand just in case it pops up on the AH. 
---
People have farmed for 5+ hours a day for a year for this book... it is rare. dont expect it to drop for you any time soon.
---
I always undercut and these people just make me laugh
---
This is one of those matchups that goes completely differently at like what I would call a Bronze level vs. a Gold level, so a lot of players have serious misconceptions about it. Shaman vs. mage is another one. This is why twitch chat acts so surprised when Cdew or Bean are having trouble with very good mages. "wtf, I farm mages as hunter/shaman." Against random opponents I guess I sort of believe that might be true but I feel like for good players both duels should be advantage mage.
---
Yes that's true. Remember that the axe is also receiving a much less harsh penalty from glancings compared to the dagger. That's 20% more damage on 40% of swings.
---
Also if you're itemizing for 10 hit that means you're making some amount of trade-off for crit or AP.
---
Why would it drop in 5 levels
---
Dude is quell Serar worth for orc?
---
Yeah works fine for now except none wants you long term. You are not going to be useful in AQ or naxx. Maybe BWL. So anyone who picks you up, either don't plan on lasting to AQ, or plan on ditching or changing you(to healer) before hand. Enjoy these early months while you can.
---
Better of just going 30/0/21 then..
---
Thanks for the help! You said alot of things I didnt know about mages. 
---
I went full AH mage with x of Frozen Wrath items. People on my server dont see the item.. I got Wrist of Frozen Wrath with 21 frost sp on AH for 80g and Head of Frozen Wrath with 40sp AH for 100g 2-3 week after release.
---
The reason "leveling combat" spec doesn't take the sword spec talents is because it wants you to be free to take any weapons that are good / an upgrade for you instead of pigeon-holing you to potentially skip things.  
---
That said, there are perfectly acceptable swords you can get and use all the way to 60 if you know what to seek out. If you know you're going to be using swords for several levels there's no reason not to take sword spec.
---
Just a tip, as a warrior you probably shouldn't be there yet at 51. All the mobs are really close together and being able to chain pull favors you greatly. I'd say 54ish is probably optimal. Try to be 1-2 levels above the quests that you are doing.
---
You can skill up to 45% threat reduction as shadow priest. You really shouldn't have problems at that point.
---
Generally as long as the damage per mana is a better ratio than frostbolt based on the number of targets, then you would use aoe instead. Usually that means about 3-4+ targets to start pressing the big boy buttons instead of just frostbolting.
---
Are you a streamer raid leader or streamer GM? Thats who he called out not streamer/raidleader/GM.
---
Not to mention for 5 mans obviously the 2 most difficult roles to fill are tank and healer. So if I'm sitting in a group with 4 people spamming for a healer for 15 mins because the person who plays the premier heal class in the game doesnt feel like it I'm gonna be kinda salty about that. 
---
Every time I go into a dungeon with meme dps it makes everything tougher. I dont even want a dps war unless they have they have the gearing to actually let them compete with rogues. My justification for bringing and spriest along is if I feel like we need a 2nd rezzer
---
The only thing I dislike about shadow priests in dungeons is that they have absolutely no threat management and go oom constantly. Their dmg is actually fine even though it doesn't fit the cleave meta.
---
Ope misread
---
I'm 21/0/30 shaman.  Another resto shaman told me he was upset because now I'd have an excuse for doing worse than him.  There's only 1 other healer that's close to me, and it's a druid.  Everyone else is a mile back, and I can blow up just about anyone with a 2.5 second cast and 2 instants.
---
Dishonorable kills only apply to NPCs though?
---
already disproven, sorry warriors you need to stop lying to the public just because you want to see big numbers
---
no one is buying your bullshit
---
Only reason I could see is making Devilsaur armor. But eh still pointless for a mage, there's better ways to make money.
---
I just did a run, got 15g in 20 mins. Did coffers and plugger too. Really boring though :)
---
Were talking about a single weapon here sorry no eggs in any baskets
---
didn't find anything on that sub either
---
Yup
---
The point of that spec is that you can still heal while giving better totems to melee groups.  It really makes sense to have a couple in the raid, although I personally kind of hate playing that way.  I went the selfish route at 21/0/30 so I can still blow people up in pvp.
---
Why have downtime when you can finish the instance in an hour.
---
It got the kid a guest appearance on Tosh.0. Tosh asked him "Explain to people who have been laid what WoW is."

---
Went human female cause holy pally human or dwarf male looks pretty goofy in healing gear all the way til Naxx. Female humans do too, but not nearly as much in my opinion. Any other class I'd go male without hesitation.
---
I have a chicken and cat mount and have used both in zf farming. There are a couple of pots when you enter the zombie area that while on a chicken you can fit between them and the wall. You can't fit on the cat. So there is a wider clip to the tiger, although I haven't found anywhere else that it's an issue.
---
Aw well rip. Guess if I want to I'd have to just go to a straight rp server
---
Just did strath ud with a shadow priest and they pulled 300 dps ish the whole time which is about the same as you see from all the other classes before raid gear and shit
---
Hey so I made a good setup while playing with a bunch of the AH addons recently and found a good setup.
---
I decided to have TSM and the desktop client for accurate tooltip info while questing and leveling. Then I have Auctioneer for more advanced tooltip info and helping me decide if I can undercut and suggest if I should DE/Sell/Vendor. Then I have Auctionator as my AH post UI since it's the most clean and simple.
---
So basically I used your advice and just added Auctioneer for the additional tooltip info. And I set it up so it only pulls up the extra tooltip when I Shift click an item. 
---
So it seems like a lot using 3 addons but i think it is working great so far, I've made some decent sells I would have vendored before.
---
It should help me make a good bit more gold. And I recently grinded and got about 30g worth of items, so it'll help me get my mount once I quest from 38-40 soon!
---
Wow I don’t think I’ve EVER lold this hard at a comment. And I just woke up, you made my day
---
Oh maybe. It's that rooting effect of frostbolt from the talent tree I meant
---
Is there a way to do this in ElvUI that you know of?
---
They do gold threat! Healing also generates aggro onto you so if you do a heal over time and pop into bear form to pull you’ll get aggro quicker
---
No, it applies to players as well.
---
What gear you rocking atm? Ive noticed my prot pali had far superior tanking gear to most warrior tanks ive seen, usually rocking about 380/390 def with 60% armour mitigation easily. For onyxia i could be capping off at 140 fire res currently with the aura so not great but i havent been trying to stack it
---
Saw it too but unfortunatley my ID is still there I wouldnt be suprised if someone from my trash farm had made a group to the ID I was connected with, and cleared it or whatever..
---
Try using "real" names and maybe you will be more emotionally invested in each character.
---
An athiest, a vegan and a crossfitter walk into a bar. Which one is the first to tell you what they are?
---
Trick question, it's the IPA homebrewer.
---
A heroic geared pally could hold threat just fine on a big group there, it's just that they got fucking crushed by those mobs if you didn't cc some of them.
---
Retail players.. u dont need to be social in it. And meters are all that matter to them anyway
---
Priest was fine. Cleaner only takes care of the intruder.
---
Grace is unbelievably powerful for entry level raiding, and people never realize that until they try with and without it.  Once tanks get a little better it's not quite as necessary tough.  When I first started raiding, I had 3 points in grace, and I sacrificed imp reincarnate and 1 from totemic focus to get it.  I've since moved on to a build without it.
---
Darn doesn't even have mage trainers
---
Telling someone to loot a devilsaur so you can skin it is the best way to end up on everyone's ignore list
---
I'm levelling dual wield and I think it's fine. I specced into arms first for improved overpower and impale. Targets will dodge more often and the overpower crits will help you counter that. As for gear, yes I wear leather pieces. I take agility over everything else. Also, do green quests and take on green mobs, you will miss and die less.   
---
I know dw levelling isn't optimal but I can't stand slow 2-h weapons... If you miss once you could be doing bo damage at all for 7 seconds! Maybe my mind will change after I get the ww axe ;)
---
Qs is 2k?? It was and is 800gish on my server
---
I said Stanley formal because he had slain Jenkins, that with no life and the destroyer of Worlds... of Warcraft.
---
Haha. Truthfully I do not know why I said Stanley.
---
# BUCKO
---
Because I have to adapt (like an adult) to the deadlines and stresses of life, and I pay for that with my time and choices. When others don't and then get a free pass, it's a big middle finger to me, the person who responsibly managed their time to get their shit done when it was supposed to be. I sacrificed my time, they didn't. Fuck 'em.
---
No, you don’t. You can to sell it quicker, but it’s not required.
---
Please explain the benefits of equipping a shield while tanking ragnaros.
---
Actually depends on what you mean? We have 2 raid teams and 4 shadow priests who take turns rotating in. We don't punish/shun anyone for playing how they want.   The majority of the wow players don't. Once you look past the streamer fanboy base you see a much different, more authentic classic experience.
---
It’s not uneven, every class has its counter, mages hard counter warriors. Warlocks hard counter mages. Rogues hard counter warlocks, etc. The game is balanced in its own great and unique way, which is known as Rock Paper Scissors
---
Cairne in the drain
---
They don't have cloak in vanilla.
---
Alliance Whitemane player... BRD, ZF, and SM entrances felt beyond stupid to bother with since the Horde had infected the area with their pro campers. 
---
I’ve had one duel where a 59 hunter tried to jump me outside of LHC and a 57 hunter stayed out of it and watched as I killed the hunter who started it; shout-out to that guy for respecting the 1v1. Meanwhile, the other day I had a Druid try to jump me, nearly die, and then call in his warlock buddy to secure the kill. Those are the problem ones who I’m looking forward to putting down hard come phase 2.
---
aye cloak of shadow was in BC tho. And a rogue is a really easy matchup for pallies.
---
Nr2 ranked paladin in the world does though. 
---

---
not as much clothspell power gear anymore but you still see the heavy focus on spellpower right? he is also not as insanely pushed for meters as Esfand is as his guild is allabout pushing esfands DPS to the top. Judgement just does good dps because he has the correct gear and consumes.
---
I've found it's server dependant based on the two I played on (which were both 50/50 according to the census data collection).  First server was Horde who were always very passive, no one really tried to organise in global, anyone who tried to ask for help or group up was often met by a snarky comment and it felt like everyone just wanted to be left alone to level.  Could have been it was the first wave of hardcore grinders I tried to keep up with that were more focused on the grind, but the Alliance felt more organised returning with backup anytime I decided to gank or fight other players of around equal level.  
---
I decided to try another server out to see if it was all in my head and I was being a little bitch or if it really was a case of no community on this specific faction on this specific server.  The difference was night and day.  People were religiously providing intel in global to the point it was just over the top and unnecessary where they were just cataloguing movements rather than actually hostile horde players.  In a single day I saw so much more calls to team up and take the fight back than I saw in the entirety of my time to 45 on the first server, I'm not even bullshitting I can count on one hand the calls to arms I saw in that whole week because I joined the majority of the ones I saw.  
---
It really felt like I'd found my people after making the switch.  It might take a lot more time investment and it's going to be too late for a lot of people but for people who can do it, maybe shop around for better communities.
---
I was looking at the aggregate data for classic on warcraft logs 1 day, and ret paladin was actually the sole lowest dps spec, slightly behind enhancement shamans.  With that said, it should still be ahead of the tanks, and provides some unique utility to the raid.  Sounds like this scenario is either hyperbole, or a very bad player.
---
Well every battle comes with its own circumstances. How each player found each other. What health, mana, rage you start at. Where you are in the world, what mobs or other players are around?  
---
What you’re thinking about is a duel. Where both players are on even terrain with even conditions. In that case, sure a warlock can simply fear and then dot. But it’s more than 2 buttons, and the other players have a chance to mess with you too. Interrupt a shadowbolt. Stunlock. Drain your mana.  
---
In open world there’s way more going on. Some of the most fun in the game imo is the way wpvp works with the zones and how you can use terrain to an advantage or disadvantage. Sometimes it just makes for funny situations.   
---
Anyways, anyone can say that you fear and hit them with corruption and siphon life and then that’s that. But usually these kind of descriptions are more macro generalizations of much more detailed encounters.
---
Rock would beat scissors, but it can’t find scissors, because scissors are invisible, so scissors beat paper and avoid rock, and that is called balance.
---
4 level 30's here. I don't have a main, I have a team. Always levelling rested!
---
Better yet, don’t play WoW
---
Look all comments maybe.
---
I can't say what this one in particular is, but KuiNameplates and ThreatPlates are two popular addons that do the same thing.
---
We talking XP here tho, arena gives none of that.
---
There are also good games that have elements of bad design.
---
All cloth is hyperbole, but there's a legitimate debate whether spellpower or melee ret is better.  I'm not informed enough to say anything more than about it.
---
Favorite place would have to be Mulgore and Bloodhoof village as it was what captivated me to play WoW all those years ago when vanilla first came out.
---
In Classic, it would be Silverpine forest as this was the first time that I actually experienced the pre-cata version of it and the lore and flow of the zone has really been outstanding!
---
He's a worthles pos. Nothing new.
---
thx for the help my man, just need some name ：D
---
I remember getting punished for killing people under x level of you but maybe I'm just going senile.
---
Completely ignoring the fact that every copper you lower yours, the sooner it sells and his becomes the new low.
---
I’m on Zandalar Tribe (EU) and I constantly see people looking for people for the lower level dungeons like DM, Stocks, SFK, Gnomer
---
Killing a grey level player is not a dhk
---
It shouldn’t be, that’s one of the more minute and subjective preferences I’ve heard. That doesn’t make it illegitimate but it shouldn’t be a reason for you to want to go horde. Alliance is awesome too.
---
Like finely aged cheese. 👌
---
Yep earlier I had about 7 boe stop including 3 blue ones that netted me 100g that hour
---
Either 2 swords
---
Or sword, dagger off hand
---
Got to keep in mind that buff threat is divided by the number of mobs around, while debuff threat is not. Makes Battle shout better again in aoe situations.
---
IQ 10
---
As someone who knows Tips Out pretty well, I will tell you he gets bad when he doesn’t have his fig newtons during raid. 
---
Memes aside, this video is hilarious and we all enjoyed it. When youre not in the raid it looks a lot worse than it actually is. 
---
NOW CLEAR COMMS AND SHUT THE FUCK UP
---
PVE minmax is the best way to get geared if people in the raid care about that, yeah....I don't get it what's your point?
---
It feels better to earn gear by leading your class/raid in damage than getting carried
---
Why do you expect random person on the internet to know how the game is written?
---
What he wrote is reasonable for a POTENTIAL way it COULD work. Doesn't mean that's automatically HOW it works. Unless you've actually seen the code then there's no way for anyone else to know.
---
That function is also implemented in Elvui
---
This happened to me before too, I was so freaked out! But it was pretty interesting to be up and close to something you always fly over in the game.
---
Could be a recruiter spec (head hunter).
---
I had to just log in BRS the other night because 2 alliance raids were camping the whole place at 9 p.m server time. Thought I could get 1 run in UBRS before bed and it took 30 minutes just to get there from the entrance. Why 2 whole raids would be starting then just seems west coast and of course all alliance on a weekday.
---
yes it was
---
When tbc dropped I bought a bunch of epics for my ret pala to level with. I bought destiny and put crusader on it. Yes it's fast but 300 str proc meant ungoro melted
---
Still don't understand this. 
---
Was leveling tailoring and was dumping items at about a 10-15% profit. Did not care to go higher because I was leveling tailoring and wanted quick turn over to continue buying mats.
---
Over the day had two people whisper me complaining I was destroying profits on specific items.
---
My reply was basically -buckle up kids, I'm dumping more. Which caused one guy to go silent and one to rage.
---
Who gives a shit what I sell my shit for. Mind you're own business.
---
put frostbolt to every button and roll ur face on keyboard= 2000dps on raid
---
i last played SB in wotlk  
---
I was spacegrass - troll shadowpriest
---
Well yea, that's what I do too though. Never buy something that's undercut by just 1c. Even in the long run, the single copper per transaction doesn't matter, so if someone wants me to buy their wares, they're gonna have to do better than that.
---
I can see your pov here. Similar issue with gnomes. Getting your UI set up exactly so is a big part of mmos, and if your character model is an annoying part of your UI, you should change it. You're gonna spend a lot of time looking at this stuff so make sure you don't hate it.
---
That requires you to have capital though
---
Small peen men pick lowbies. average peen men fight back when attacked. big peen is taking your level 1 warrior nelf to gurubashi arena high noon.
---
&gt; I will not invite a boomkin into my group or raid over a mage.
---
Well you're not really min maxing then, because it requires optimizing raid comp, and not always picking 1 class over another.  1 class may perform better over another 1 v 1 on the damage meters, but what's important is the synergistic benefit of the entire raid comp.  
---
Do you only have 2 locks for curses?  What if you add a 3rd and a shadow priest?  You're adding people that objectively perform worse on the meters, but potentially have a greater benefit to the raid as a whole.  That's what's great about classic.  It's full of questions like this.
---
ganking lows?
---
Yeah but he didn't say those. He said thunderclap, which isn't an aoe threat ability.
---
3%
---
Are the other blessings also affected by righteous fury?
---
more like: netflix and fishmonger
---
why waste mana or a silence? just have wand on 1 and start frostbolt at 2. wand totems.
---
Firefins aren't used in gffp.
---
u can make 6-9gold=hour when if u solo maraudon for hour  \~50g vendor trash.
---
3 targets or more use blizzard and CoC as long as it won’t pull threat and as long as you have the mana. Otherwise frostbolt (best 1-2 target spell for damage per second as well as most mana efficient per amount of damage done).
---
If you see a 60 priest named Burry we chill until someone starts picking my flowers.
---
A month ago, I read an article regarding the episode between Blizzard and South Park creators: Trey Parker &amp; Matt Stone. Blizzard was onboard and SP creators had second thoughts before its creation.
---
“Make Love, Not Warcraft” is a one-of-a-kind episode. I remember the entire plot since it aired 13 years ago. Issues arose during the episode’s production. Blizzard agreed to help Parker &amp; Stone—to their absolute surprise. Near the end of production, Parker was so unhappy with the episode, he called Comedy Central begging them to not air the show and that it would “ruin the ‘South Park’ legacy.” Parker was shocked at how well the episode was received. 
---
“Make Love, Not Warcraft” is one of the best episodes of South Park, if not the best, in my opinion. The fact that the episode might have been scrapped is mind blowing. Blizzard killed two birds with one stone with publicity: the South Park episode and the old celebrity World of Warcraft commercials (ex. I am Mister T and this is my night elf Mohawk!, Verne Troyer’s *RIP* Gnome Mage, William Shatner’s Tauren Shaman, and so on). In contrast, Parker feared that the episode would be the end of South Park. 13 years ago....
---
Neatplates
---
&gt; fights are going to get shorter and shorter for the rest of Vanilla.
---
That's not at all true.  Within the tier, sure, but this phase is the shortest fights we'll see for all of vanilla.  It requires me to start acquiring some gear on my resto shaman that I simply won't use this phase, because the stat priorities change in future tiers when fights are longer.
---
Was meant to reply to him not you my bad
---
tauren melee is around 7 yards, add inn lee-way and it's pretty huge.  
---
It's pretty awesome for warriors and enhancement shamans. Awful for the rest.
---
That’s a lot of work. 
---
When someone takes my ore/fish I usually just say “Hey, guy. Fuck off.”
---
Never had any success.
---
yes. that's my point.
---
Carebear server lul
---
I agree with most of what you said, but especially at this point in time, the small buff the boomkin brings does not make up for the dps loss of losing the slot. Even if you put the boomkin in a group with your top 4 mages/warlocks, he will not provide enough damage to make up for his extremely low dps.
---
We do bring 3 locks and a shadow weaving priest specced into Power Infusion.
---
How much spell damage until cons takes over again?
---
Your healing officer is wrong. There is a reason regrowth is expensive, fast cast time and can be talented to 50% crit. It's your version of flasj heal. The issue I see is having swift mend is op if you are main tank healer
---
&gt; shazzrah, geddon, and ragnaros
---
No enrage timers, no soft enrages.
---
You can do the mechanics for hours if you want. Only limited by healer mana.
---
Vael is a hard dps check, as there is a huge timer on it before it is literally killing people.
---
It's very much worth getting since its still bis even at level 60. Getting it early on is a massive boost
---
Thanks a lot! I really appreciate you helping me figure this out.
---
Herbalism by far. You don’t get anything from alchemy that someone else can’t do for you
---
1-100 going over 100.
---
„I feel bad for you“
---
„I don‘t think about you at all“
---
Take a trip to red ridge sometime
---
More like a grape, lol
---
Automated buying isn't legal, and you will be suspended by blizzard if caught doing it.  That's the problem.  It doesn't have to be automated.  There are tools to just do it really fast.
---
I think it got fixed in cataclysm? Where it gave you a half second of immunity basically when you vanished?
---
There were no diminishing returns on def stats in tbc so paladin tanks could become 100% physical dmg immune. At tier 4/5 lvl gear you were immune to trash mob dmg in heroic dungeons, higher than that you started to become immune to boss dmg.
---
Nah you need 2h spec because staves fall off too hard.  Need a big 2h to deal with non physical characters
---
Blacksmithing is nice for the fear cleanse trinket if you intend to tank or pvp.
---
&gt; I am against addons that are giving more than what a human being is be able to achieve in a no matter of time. As example this one
---
That's literally the purpose of almost every addon.  There's plenty of mmos that don't allow them, if you're being serious.
---
Sometimes pvp just won’t go your way. Especially as a mage as you have low health/armor
---
That is exactly me. Sometimes a memory springs back into mind, like when I pointed out we have to kill the tree trash mobs in Dire Maul West before engaging the boss. Other times I do incredibly stupid mistakes like forgetting Remove Curse has less range than some of my other spells.
---
I don't think my experience in Naxxramas will ever mean a lot, because these days you have guides either way and raiding was always a group effort.
---
Private server people definitely have a large edge, simply because they have more recent memories and because they had years and years to figure stuff out. Back the when preparing for MC I was proud of myself that I realized the Magister set wasn't that great for my mage and went with the set from Scholomance instead. Now compare that to the current days, where most people know exactly where to get their pre-raid BiS spell damage gear.
---
Sure some mechanics work different on private servers (remember everyone spelling doom about DM east lashers?), but the private servers are certainly more similar to the current game than my 15 year old memories.
---
As a druid your overall strat is often to wear your opponent down instead of rushing to kill him and you also want to have a plan ready for your next heal. Engineering and magic dust helps a lot! I started PvPing at level 30, here's a video of what it looked like: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RMSupkTfPc
---
It dropped in my group today questing with a warlock. He beat my roll, the lucky bastard.
---
I did, that's the only partially critical comment chain I could find
---
picture in picture extension for google chrome works great too if you don't have a second screen
---
How is using a hearthstone in that situation a win? Like i dont get it.
---
Seems so stupid especially when you're currently doing something so you are hearthing away? Thats way more time wasted than just dying lol.
---
It's just not a good idea. It's far too expensive for what a small upgrade it is. There are always Molten Core raids running, be it PUGs or guilds, that you should be able to find a spot on. 
---
If you want to maximize your raid DPS you should pick up a Bonescraper MH and a Distracting Dagger OH coupled with 6pc Shadowcraft, that's quite powerful. Yes, a 1.4s dagger mainhand because white hits matter a lot.
---
https://discord.gg/Pkkntws has a lot of good information if you're curious. Including BloodMoon's DPS spreadsheet which is a really nice tool.
---
All PvP servers except Heartseeker are Horde-dominated.
---
The sword isn't that good but it is easily the best tank weapon you can get for a couple of phases.
---
I never AoE in a dungeon with people I don’t know. Too many things can go wrong. Unless the tank specifically says it’s ok, and I think he’s capable, would I do it.  
---
Single target frost bolt is safe, but slow.
---
Ret is not about damage done. Ret is about utility while also adding a small amount of damage.
---
Rets can cleanse and DPS at the same time, whereas Holy Paladins can't cleanse and heal at the same time. This is important considering a Holy Paladin's #1 job is to cleanse.
---
I think this is fixed in wrath. Not surd thou
---
I know it's a bit late but on newly tamed pets I don't have the bug anymore, no.
---
Go for soul link then.
---
90+ kills, never seen it
---
If you aren't a troll you aren't minmaxing threat as a horde tank.
---
Ive given up on it, just fuck this item
---
I strikes me how many characters I encounter in WoW are cows which leads me to wondering how many of them actually are cows. I personally don't care what species people play as, but I was just wondering.
---
Which turtles?
---
Noob here, what is ZF??
---
Just be careful, a lot of people are stockpiling FAPs and their mats. When P2 is released, a shitload will be dumped on the market, which will probably make the supply much bigger than the demand for a long while, pushing the price down. 
---
Kinda the same thing, to a lesser extent, happened with Larval Acid on my server with DM. Price was at the high point just before release.
---
I'm definitely gonna try to gradually dump a bit of my stockpiles in the week or so before P2.
---
Classic group pvp aka hold W and sapper.
---
Your talking about a item with high supply and low demand. Essentially a item of little value. I feel you missed the whole point. You are literally defining price fixing. Trying to force a certain price when value is actually much lower. You cant really get upset the market gets flooded with other sellers, it just the reality of a item with high supply.
---
Reason you "cant" just buy them all up is because it not actually worth the price you are trying to sell at. As mentioned by many people, it a complete lack of understanding how economics work.
---
Yes in a perfect situation where everyone is just to lazy to post a certain item and you are lucky enough to be only person on AH to post it, then you can make money far higher then its market value. But that completely irrelevant to its actual value. You are simply taking advantage of a temporary scarcity in the market.
---
It nice while it lasts, but any item with high supply that easy to obtain its only a matter of time before everyone else notices and flood the market again.
---
It not that the item deserves to sell higher, it just dumb luck you happen to sell a item while there a temporary scarcity.
---
In MMO Items with both high supply and high demand often follow a wave pattern. Where there be lot of stock in AH driving price down, people then buy out entire supply, people are slow to restock because they have lives so price of item goes up 100-500% for a bit. When everyone restocks the price will shoot back down.
---
Also speaking generally 40 of certain item is extremely small quantity of sales, only item with virtually no demand will struggle to move that amount of product. Which we come back to the whole idea of trying to force profits on a item with zero demand, and thus low value. Only real exception is if the supply is even lower then the demand. In this case it could take weeks or months to find a buy but can still yield a profits purely based on its rarity.
---
Every guide out there says that Horde racials are best for PvP, especially WotF. So every dickhead who only wants to gank lowbies, rolls an undead rogue, because this is THE ganking race/class combo.
---
Other than things like fear ward, your race won't make a difference between leading and being carried.
---
I typically make my melee characters male and caster/ranged characters female.  
---
Among my friend group the guys play pretty much 50-50 male/female, but I don't think I've ever encountered any girl in my group or in discord who played a male character. Interesting pattern, not really sure how to explain.  
---
Ideas:   
---
\-Guys like looking at girls more than girls like looking at guys.  
---
\-Guys tend to fashion their character after some kind of character idea/archetype that may not have anything to do with how they think of themselves in real life, whereas girls tend to think of their characters as extensions of themselves.
---
Yeah it's always horde, or alliance.
---
I thought I was the only vanilla Spinebreaker player left on Earth
---
Why do you say that? there is outside arenas only 3 types of pvp: 
---
ganking someone who cant fight back effectively
---
1v1 its on bro that was MY quest mob...
---
and organised group pvp. Wether thats open world, lets raid goldshire or lets bo a wsg, or lets kill thrall with 38 dudes. 
---
This guys specific concern is that in 1v1s the mage cant hard cast. If you do (he asserts) you will die: end off. He might even be right. Yet the group pvp situation is the one place you can hope for allies to intervene, for heals, for distracted enemies etc. Your comment is backwards: it should have said "sounds like all you do is duel outside of orgimar"  yet if this guy can consistently stay alive and win duels... I think thats gonna translate into BG success as well. 
---
Been an interesting debate actually to read, I wouldnt like to say whose right as I dont have enough pvp mage experience yet. Im choosing to reply to you though cos as I said, you got the criticism of the op backwards. Deep frost in group play is gonna be sick.
---
Is that a druid with hand of rag
---
With edgemasters it is
---
Is using the back corner at Qia to avoid the guards legit or an exploit?
---
you really cracked the code there my dude
---
Oh for fucks sakes they kept THAT mechanic in?
---
Oh that sucks balls.
---
im speaking in low level sense, like 40s for switching. u cant find much gear with spell dmg or nature wrath. but higher levels yes that is obvious.
---
also didnt know about that spellbatching i must try it, that will make killing much faster and easier
---
Pro tip - always do some research before pulling things out of you ass.

[Blizzard response to bow tied rolls are handled](https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/36765-need-roll-tie-why-did-the-other-guy-get-it/)
---
To be honest communication and feeling out the tank are key for dungeon aoe. First group of 4 mobs don't aoe untill you see every mob gets dmged at least a bit. If people ask you to stop do it. A trick to doing aoe in dungeons as a mage is rooting them first then blizzard. When only the tank is in range during the root they will still hit him helping to keep aggro. Also if you have a lock time the root with his aoe as well.
---
I had a gnomeregan run yesterday where my lock (lvl30) did 200 to 300dps when using his selfdmg aoe.
---
i play a cute female night elf hunter and im an overweight mid 20 something year old :)
---
Garbage. Terrible post
---
all these flavors yet you decided to be salty
---
40g per craft.  You own the market.  People are already decking out alts so capitalize on the opportunity and make some money.
---
14% is what I prefer
---
On fights where the fight revolves around one class performing a mechanic (i.e. warlocks on Garr, mages on Lucifron), I usually tell them that they should devote their entire time to doing that and just ignore dps'ing. In fact, I tell them that it will look bad on them if they beat other people on the dps meter because it means they weren't doing their job. Damage isn't a concern, a Garr minion running free and killing people is. It's also important to note that Restorative Potion is very useful on Lucifron and Baron Geddon, as it allows dispellers a full 30 seconds of focusing on tasks other than dispelling.
---
He's wearing black dragonscale shoulders :p
---
Warrior. The robe is our guild uniform.
---
Combat dagger is great because of the current itemization. Perdition blade and core hound tooth are really strong and already in the game, same with aged core leather gloves.
---
ya ur too late every1 60 already
---
In dungeons, people only care if you are rolling against them.
---
It\`s proc-based. If you want mitigation - get Ardent Custodian, it at least has 100% uptime. If you want threat - get something fast, like Alcor's Sunrazor.
---
A furywarriors, who’s not a human or an orc, best in slot weapon is perditionsblade mh and cht offhand when you look at the rankings across the logs. However perd should always go to the daggerrogues first since it’s a bigger upgrade for them and will last them to phase 5. Furywarriors, as have been said in previous comments, have more weapons to choose from that’s almost as good. 
---
I’m working towards my fury/prot and i want Perd and CHT but i’m passing it until all the daggerrogues have it them i will roll against the dpswarriors 😉
---
in classic it's not entirely the case that every mob of a certain type are immune or not. I've found undead that can be feared, and elementals that could be bled.
---
This may be true for vanilla. Definitely not further down the line.
---
A cool quest to get badass-looking sword of epeen enlargement, basically.

Tanaris, along the coast until you're higher than the ones south

Baby
---
They were figured out eventually. I know the top PvP people on my server totally had established an order they would rank up. They'd still have to farm a couple of hours each day of course, but as you needed a BG group to get enough honor to compete and you would hear from the other faction if a new BG group formed, there were very few surprises.
---
I remember some drama when one guy farmed more honor than he was allowed to during one week, but as all I wanted were the PvP mounts I didn't care too much about that stuff.
---
Hint: If this is the case, you are not ”underpricing”, you are trying to find the market price.
---
make sure everyone knows who gets to roll on legendaries
---
I've a vastly different experience than that actually. The first auctionator file I found and it instantly worked, plus the scans are like 12 to 15 seconds for 28k auctions. I'm curious as to why there is such a massive difference between your scan and mine, am I missing something?
---
The effects of trauma have never been more apparent.
---
There where already empirical studies about that...  And some girls play male characters as in there view on the world only males can be heroes...  It's not that simple after all.  Some people play big night elf or human just because they lack ego and want to feel good. I personally like small and/or handsome characters as people tend to underestimate you...  Many reasons but not to important as it's an rpg... Accept characters as they are just as in RL.
---
Holy dps priests too, Strat Scholo nd DM W just really appreciate being able to shackle, MC, and buff with Shadow Prot.
---
Ecks deeeeeeeeee
---
Grab some gear from 5 man dungeons. Then you may try solo maraudon princess runs. You can mine there too, tons of guides on youtube aswell. As for mining, level 60 zones could give decent profit but they are usually overfarmed. Try winterspring, silithus, eastern plaguelands in odd hours, see if you can get lucky.
---
I think that's a good assumption that you're the only one on the server able to make it. As for what to charge currently enchanters are asking 50g per enchant that dropped from mc.( 55 healing 30 spell power) The engi scope is being charged 60g per craft. If they are crafting this bag its because they have gold and are well off to drop 12 mooncloth 2 large brilliant and core leather. This is a rare drop don't cheat yourself and don't take less than 40g per craft. If you feel like donating gold or flasks to your guild after you get an epic mount that's fair and justified.
---
&gt;in raids you should have reached the cap already
---
Haven't you followed the meta? Def cap is overrated and everyone is going for more threat. 2.0 speed is also pretty slow.
---
Warriors do the same exact thing though because they want to dps
---
I raided naxx. Trash runs for fire ring
---
Too soon
---
I don't get it...
---
See this is why I kept reading all your comments. You should consider making a guide bro.
---
Nah they are targetable and hostile but does nothing.
---
You posting this with magic!?
---
I understand everyone rolling need on pricey boe stuff but given that it's the same item, if I were jabberjock I'd of passed on the additional drops. He won 2/3..
---
ya target can eat a dick
---
&gt;Who uses them?
---
Healers.
---
Rag is all fire damage. You could literally wear cloth stacked with fire resist and tank him.
---
Idk some streamers are not too bad. I like AlkxD.
---
Looks like Elvui
---
Devil’s advocate:  The blue post response is possibly from a customer support person (correct me if I’m wrong) rather than an actual developer.  Maybe they are just, in fact, explaining it in layman terms.
---
Either way, I don’t think it matters if it’s a second roll vs a lengthy decimal notation, but the math from another post in this chain makes the decimal notation option more logical in creating satisfactory roll determinations.
---
Well, yes, but it's possible you're forming a group and waiting on a guildie to finish another run.  In that case you still want to look for more people, but perhaps aren't ready to start as soon as you find enough.
---
I will agree that "good to go once the group fills up" is a good default assumption and that the counter-example should be the thing that is clarified, e.g. "LF1M Heals UBRS starting in 20 min" or something, but people wouldn't really respond well to that I think so we get the opposite.
---
&gt;cloth is sometimes the only option
---
Not really. There\`s usually some good leather around.
---
As someone else said that is a hunter ability called "Hunter's Mark". However if you right click on the mob portrait there is an option there to put other marks on your target, like skulls or squares.
---
All threat reduction in fade, fades when fade fades.
---
Glad to hear another side of the story, its just too bad people have already taken sides.
---
But you can make money from it?
---
Quiet boomer, yours weren't any better
---
Winter squid and Nightfin sell great on raid days. Usually 15-20s each on off days and easily double for raiders.
---
At 35?
---
Yep. Auction addons are extremely blatant gameplay automation (automating tedious searches that would take ages for player to do and analyze). And they are insanely detrimental towards players that don't have them. It's really weird that Blizzard tolerates them.
---
&gt; Reasoning: Tank Shaman is not really a thing, mostly because of itemization, but also because it has no way to hold aggro on multi-target scenarios. While this does remove some of the ability to hold threat on single target, it adds an ability to hold it on multi target.
---
Tank Shaman is a thing https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=1150 and yes there are 2 ways for them to hold aggro on multi-target scenarios that come close and even surpass a feral druid aoe threat.
---
I don’t understand the comments, here...
---
You sell the bag on the AH for the price of the mats, plus 50-100%
---
What’s with this 40g bullshit?
---
I wait for 2 gaurds to stand on the left side, then i charge and hamstring both while running to the gate as a warrior
---
Aptechka, healbot and grid + clique are the best options and it mostly just depends on what you like
---
he did give one of them away. were all guildies. he was meme'ing

I bet he couldn't sleep that night:  
---
'I'm not even kill-worthy'
---
I'm starting to think you are not operating on good faith. One dude straight out called anyone playing hunte a "pleb". Did you read that part?
---
I don't know if you realize but "proof" isn't just linking to another one of your comments saying shit with no numbers behind it.  
---
Deflection is the only one of those talents that actually makes you AT ALL tankier and 5% parry is not what I would consider "utterly dominating" in mitigation.  
---
&gt;imp heroic strike, shield slam, and improved sunder armor  
---
So saving 3 rage off heroics, 3 rage off sunders and just having access to shield slam creates an "utterly dominating" situation in a full prot warrior's favor? You do realize that after a certain gear level that warriors get this thing called "rage capped" where it's difficult for them to spend their rage fast enough. Investing talents in reducing the cost of these skills is fucking irrelevant for any content that matters. I feel like you're just pulling opinions out of your ass and trying to pass them as fact. Sure, fury/prot isn't going to be good if you're in quest greens and a few BRD blues but once you actually have some level of gear to back it up it's much stronger in most situations. That said, you can tank every single non-raid as arms and once you start raiding you get gear funneled to you so why go full prot again?
---
What I do is I watch my character and the enemies character. Thats about it. I know my cooldowns and I can see how much damage im taking by adding the numbers on my screen. That way I never have to look at my castbars or my health. 
---
It all comes down to knowing your numbers and the enemy classes.
---
preach
---
"freshspaff" err
---
Yeah friend also helped
---
That's not how it works honey
---
When you’re rolling with pugs, you can’t remember expect anyone to exceed at their job. Fights are gonna be harder. You can do the fights without em, but you’re going to have wipes. And wipes are what kill pugs.
---
Everyone drops 20-30g to guarantee no wipes. 
---
And, if they don’t use those consumes now, they will use em eventually, so none of it goes to waste.
---
[I tried that, didn't work](https://i.imgur.com/AuR4U2y.png)
---
Black rock the dungeon?
---
Conjure Internet bro
---
If I bring you all the mats and you try to charge me 200G for crafting it for me I'm gonna /Spit on you and walk away with my 16 slot bags instead.
---
If OP makes and sells them on his own then Mats+ 50-100% is perfectly resonable.
---
In one on one? Sure. Pretty much anything shits on holy paladins there. But in group PvP? 
---
My current PvP suit has a 5k mana pool unbuffed. Good luck mana burning that before I converted at least half of that pool to heals/dispells. And yes, full plate with shield with more HP then you'll likely have. 
---
While I agree that mana burn and dispells are dangerous to holy paladins, the smart ones solve that issue by staying at max range. Healrange is bigger then purge/manaburn range and if you're decide to get close my patients will deal with you. If all else fails and I'm forced to make the most out of a bad situation I'll bubble. 12sec immunity to manaburn and I can use up all that mana for something  useful.
---
Where it's absolutely lethal is against ret paladins that stat towards physical dps. But if they run around in a melee with 2,5k mana they deserve all the mana burns they can catch. It's the same with enhancement shamans really. Always fun to see a quarter of his mana bar evaporate each time hes hit by a manaburn.
---
I don’t even know how you can grind for gold and make 900 by lvl 35 unless you’re fighting gray mobs all the time. 
---
Pre-BiS isn’t all the gear you want obviously. Plenty you can’t buy and hopefully eventually you’ll get better than pre-BiS. You then have to enchant all that gear as well. Consumables can be expensive and always in demand.
---
You could also aim for a second mount from a different race. That’s always a good gold sink.
---
I've played mages for years and years and I'm levelling the same way as you.
---
As for PVP, make sure you have all your skills bound, you arent keyboard turning and unbind your walk backwards key (so you're forced to move properly), and then just get stuck in. Like anything else it's a skill. You need to know what your own character can do and then what every other class can do so basically you have to learn every ability in the game. But it happens naturally and doesn't take long.
---
Yeah, i always enjoy watching his 50-100ex zdps builds in poe
---
I liked it :)
---
Zandalar player here, world pvp is active but people usually respect random levellers. Pvp mostly happens when competing for resources and mobs.
---
50/50
---
you have to think of your raid group too and their capabilities too, not just simply your own spec.
---
without shield, you will definitely take more damage, boss will crit you, boss will crush you, the damage you take is spikey. You would want the boss to crit you to proc enrage but.....Can your raid healers handle that? Are your healers geared with enough mp5 and int to handle you? Are you also able to consistently make a sound judgement by switching to shield at the right time?
---
no doubt your threat will be through the roof, but are your raid's highest few dps pushing so high on threat that warrant you to consider switching to this spec? Does your guild have the raid on farm that you can consistently clear the bosses in reasonable timing?
---
Not saying the spec sucks or will not work, it is a great spec and will definitely work imo. But you look at skarm, his gear is pretty much naxx level and have different gear to switch to. His raid healers and dps are also very wrll geared and able to push out the necessary healing and dps. While his videos are indeed educational and interesting, but you really need to ask can your raid handle it if you want to switch to fury prot.
---
Ultimately, raiding is not just about you, raiding is about you and the people you raid with and how you cooperate with them to clear end game content. It is useless if you are pushing godlike threat but your healers are struggling to keep your health up and your dps are not killing the boss fast enough. Sure enough, all your healers can just focus on you but what about raid damage? it's not like later expansions where you have prayer of mending auto jumping through the raid and various classes having raid wide healing abilites.
---
Just bought items to hold my slots temporarily until I can farm them in dungeons
---
Bragging post for sure. Also gold buying is bannable
---
This is what i've been wondering about. But i don't believe you are correct. Even though his hits show up as fire damage, he is blockable, which leads me to think armor matters. Because on regular elementals, and baron geddon, using shield block does nothing. Their hits don't use up shield block, so their moves can't be blocked.
---
I dont know what noobs you encountered on your server but most of us just bully paladins till they hs off or are tired of running. Every range class can stay away from you and warriors after 40 (if they know what they are doing) will destroy you. Not even gonna bring good rogues and shamans into discussion here.
---
You'd probably have an easier time levelling a match from scratch and getting to a lvl where you can do a decent aoe farm and get the gold for your epic faster than you could get rank 11 lol
---
Blocking.
---
Just trying to figure out how you farmed nearly 1k gold but are level 35 and when you farmed around in BlackRock was it the spots outside the dungeon?
---
&gt; I play a Prot Paladin at level 60 in classic on Stalagg. Decent gear and stats to tank dungeons and I have lots of fun doing it but obviously its not the best tank class but I still have fun with it! Id like to make a group of other 'memers'. Im looking for maybe a Shadow Priest, Resto Druid, Arcane Mage, Ret Pally, Dps Druid etc. Get a group together that gets a lot of hate to slug out some max level 5 mans. Anyone out there playing a less favored class? Lets get together!
---
I understand the lack of information to clump up some of these specs together but none of these are "meme" specs.
---
Also smart call on pre buying stuff
---
oh cool so for 99% of the game, the shit is dumb
---
but hey you want to advocate for the 1% as if it's VALID
---
it's not. shut up and stop convincing idiot noobs this is a good idea. you're ruining the game for everyone
---
That’s why I would never give my services away to people giving me their mats.  There’s no money in working for tips.  I learned long ago it’s not worth my time.
---
not just horde
---
people who do it have tiny weiners
---
F
---
Yes! This!
---
This is a prime example of why you should never work for tips.  You’re transferring your profits to the people selling the mats.

you could probably buff them with a scroll then vanish
---
Spotted the boomer.
---
Compared to current weapons it is actually quite good. It gets beat by Perd blade and Brut for humans. Top three is still good especially considering it is a weapon.
---
Or you can be like some dude on Skerem a while back: Buy the entire market of nightfin snappers, repost them for 600% market price and then get undercut by myself and other people within minutes.
---
I'm level 25 and have 49 nature spell damage. Lots of nature wrath gear is on our auction house dirt cheap, and way stronger than most blues with some int or spirit on them.
---
Leveling so far has been a breeze. If you have a good weapon, then you can still hit your enemy with swings for some decent dmg. Rockbiter is crazy strong, and great for finishing enemies off.
---
&gt; When the first weapon that makes your build somewhat viable is from AQ40 trash and the other recommend weapon is Ashbringer, I kind of lose interest.
---
Nope, there's Shadowstrike from MC and Ancient Hakkari Manslayer from ZG and Wraith Scythe from BRD.
---
youre a moron then tbh
---
Yep, only civilians are dhks
---
Im good ty.
---
His messages scream boomer.
---
Alcor as bis threat is from the Nost era. It isn’t true on Classic.
---
yes?
---
But I like post Malone!
---
Lol nice bait post
---
There is no rp on zandalar
---
I use Magister's 3 piece, and take Arcane Resilience and Frost Warding and it doesn't really matter, you're still gonna get 1-tapped on that farm if you make a real mistake. I only take those talents because there's nothing better to spend the points on but I don't really feel much of a difference from having good armor.
---
The key thing is mana. You need over 6000. I am still using a bunch of pieces like Master's Vest of Intellect and I don't see myself changing those out any time soon. Run speed on boots is also mandatory; I learned the farm without it and having it now is making a huge difference.
---
I think it's not the mouse, I've been experiencing it, mostly in relation with right click if I recall correctly.
---
On my server, alliance is outnumbered without even seeing census data.  On top of this, horde actually fights back while alliance runs.  
---
My guild it like 9 people will fly from wherever on Azeroth to fight back.  We organized raids to retake Marshalls refuge only to lose because horde had 60s come while we had low 50s.  We had people from more than 1 500+ member guilds that blind invite... They had 0 guildees come to fight.  It's sad.  There is no guild comraderie like in vanilla..
---
Wait till Obama hears about you sneaky mining
---
I wonder if cat druid was good in TBC. I don’t remember ever seeing one in raiding, probably mostly because bear and resto were both so insanely strong.
---
holy shit your action bar is auto attack, ur seal, and judgement. people wernet kidding when pallie leveling is just autoing
---
What's a GFPP
---
just hit them when they move faster than you and outrange you by 20 yards
---
C
---
Honestly i was about to play on Westfall realm , Thanks god i didnt choosed that realm lol
---
&gt;Also warriors were not recent ment to be DPS considering their first set pieces their pure tank
---
Just fyi, the original stats on Might made it a dpsset. So after the rework you suddenly had your dpswarriors equipped with better tanking gear than the MT.
---
Why should you? If you have fun doing that, keep it up
---
Someone couldn’t catch the zoomy boi
---
Holy crap, you actually caught a raptor?!
---
Thanks a lot
---
It’s like when you’re in a pvp zone and someone says “stop kill or i report u”. It’s just dumb.
---
Imo human paladins in general have shitty animations. Female dwarf&gt;male dwarf&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;human
---
If horde, within northern Mulgore theres a rare spawn named "the rake" and it has the highest attack speed until lvl 40ish. 
---
If alliance, go to teldrassil and tame an owl, they have screech which will cause aoe threat, and are generally tanky.
---
BoP is against physical attacks, it won't do anything. But Paladin tanks can bubble before and drop it after the spell hit. You still loose aggro so it's not great but atleast you are not sleeping
---
Depends of the item cost on your server, just try to look them up on the AH?
---
Some people have been saying this for almost years now, there's been plenty of evidence of his behavior and how fake he is in his videos. While I'm happy you figured it out, I'm also a bit disheartened that this is a surprise.

For reference I'm levelling atm (31) with my friend boosting me through dungeons multiple times to get drops/xp.
---
Ive got about 50g, and that's including selling stuff on the AH.
---
There's literally zero way OP has that much gold just from doing dungeons.
---
its shit
---
the non top tier mats sell like crap
---
wrong
---
Personally I just put the extra spells on another action bar. The two vertical bars on the right for spells with no CD or a shared cooldown with another on my main spell bar area such as potions.
---
If you run out of action bar space I’m sure there are addons for it.
---
There's literally zero way OP has that much gold just from doing dungeons, even with skinning.
---
I have a 60 duel wield fury warrior, and I had the same in classic. I definitely wouldn't recommend going DW too early and not usually before 40ish. For end game this is the spec you want if you want to really do serious dps, however you wont have enough talent points available or gear to make it work properly at low level.
---
Its silly converstion yes, but i still agree. I hate when someone undercuts by 40s !!
---
moar dots XD leeeeeeroooooy kek
---
This but give 1g tip to the mage.
---
RMT , he keeps making posts like this bragging about spending obscene amounts of gold , i think he likes the attention and doesn’t care people know he RMT’s , just a troll .

lol, but i always finish on par with everyone else, id doesnt matter if I do less dmg either as I just saved the healer by off tanking, and healed the mage when he took aggro and the healer is oom. the bad image you are providing thinking druid is made for one spec
---
With a good prot paladin tank you won't realise an aggro reset even happened.
---
You are assuming massive downsides that don't exists anymore. In the worst case scenario you are asking a few individuals to carry a few Limited Invul Potions or BoP's.

I've watched so many Peppa Pig video edits that just actually read that in her voice

Complaining about PVP in South shore lol your first time playing wow?
---
it's fine for raid healing, but, if you're going for more of a caster PvP spec, you don't need Omen of Clarity. i'd do something more like this: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/5140003-5032001-055523100015
---
you guys realise the ass part of the post was a joke right?
---
It's ok to not agree, but there's a reason it does well in the DPS spreadsheet. For raiding, your white hits make up ~50% of your overall damage so a faster mainhand is perfectly acceptable. Slower is better, but not at the cost of overall DPS/stats.
---
Is a paladin stronger than a priest in PvP around level 30?  
---
There has been a guy hunting me and I have a kinda hard rime dispatching him while questing.
---
I also join any PvP in progress, even if the enemies are level??. You never know when a slow or slightly delayed casting might make a difference. Only thing I usually leave alone are 1v1s.
---
However, I see (compared to what I remember from Vanilla) a huge amount of people who rolled on a PvP server but don't really want to PvP. Last night I witnessed an hour long discussion in Guld chat about how much it sucks that people gank you and don't leave you alone to quest. Might be because so many private servers were PvP so many people don't really get PvE servers right now, I dunno.
---
Come on quit the crying, you signed up for a pvp server. Ganking is a part of that
---
Saw a post some weeks ago that was a horde on stalagg running around killing low levels where he said his goal was to get all the alliance to leave the server. If people have that mentality I can't really blame anyone for leaving.
---
Good one. I'll use that.
---
Why does everything have to be balanced? I would have preferred if all of the classes were unique to each faction. I think that's the way it worked in DAoC, and they had three factions, not two.
---
Sometimes the mage is still drinking, watching me. Judging me.
---
Are they multiboxers? If so fuck em, I hope they get ganked
---
Are you horde or alliance? Some good areas to quest in the 30s include: thousand needles, Desolace, Badlands, Swamp of Sorrows. (Id do it in that order) Also, if you're not bothered by high pvp zones, Hillsbrad Foothills and Stranglethorn Vale are good amounts of experience at your level, if you survive. Hope that helps :)
---
Doesn't work with anything other than trinkets.😔
---
Yup.. but it would be in his best interest not to.  No one is making the argument that he isn't free to do whatever he wants.  It's simply a rookie mistake, rooted in not understanding the market.  But by all means continue on.
---
The heroic dungeon philosophy was changed in wotlk where the challenge was moved to achievements instead of heroics.
---
You can't bubble while tanking or the boss changes target. You can only use it with a cancelaura macro to remove debuffs.
---
LoH, while good, isn't better than ShieldWall-Last Stand.
---
Nah we have the stinky Dwarves.
---
Bf here. She‘s playing on a pve server, so not much war going on there, except for hunters stealing your mobs with quick shot. 
---
(We do want to play on a pvp server, though. But we already invested so much time into our characters.. and I personally just got my mount.. blizzard we would even pay for character transfers.. pleeeaaase)
---
This is the spec I was thinking about for a more caster PvP / raid healing build.

---
Stopping people from progressing is a punishable offense? This guy would instantly have a stroke if he tried logging onto a pvp server, literally 7 lvl 60s paroling around my corpse in EPL now after I came up here hoping it would be less ganking and camping than in Felwood.
---
Did you get a hold of a 1.14 version? If so I'd appreciate getting my hands on it!
---
Nah never heard of that mechanic. Perhaps you're thinking of server layering? That would make it so mine nodes would be on different 'instances'
---
But most of the wow classic servers have just gone down to one layer anyway.
---
You have no proof to accuse me of buying gold. I have friends who fund me and help me spam dungeons. It’s not my fault you can’t afford an epic mount at 60.
---
&gt; is fine to tank EVERYTHING with

no
---
it's not. and **as a HEALER** i'm the one that gets to make this determination, not you

Im yet to see balck lotus spawn.  Those flask are friggin expensive to be used in mc

There's no such thing as "toxic person". There's toxic *behavior*. Don't be mean, probably the person just had a bad day.

Damn, thank you for the response, guess we need to research some addon thats more custumizble.

How about the macro? Did it work okay?

Really? my experience with dreadmist horde we are always hyped and join ranks to stop ganks. May fave times was arathi and the yeti caves.
---
Dreadmist Horde Represent!
---
Help our homies!
---
Calm down ladies, i'm here :)). I moved to Sylvanas in wotlk due to lack of raiding guilds, but my heart is Spinebreaker
---
I've soloed them all as a hunter, with warlock you can at least solo the first 2.
---
We duo'd the entire instance as hunter/mage.
---
&gt; If I have multiple characters, does it really matter who does what? I'd rather keep the skinning skill I've built up.
---
Yes. Some recipes require quite a long reputation grind.
---
Guilds currently take 1 and only 1 shadow priest.
---
They take 3 debuff slots, SWP, Mind Flay, and the Warlock shadow damage buff. Plus Mind Flay being 24 yards maximum range means they don’t do damage very well in fights like shazz or Ony.
---
Any guild that is taking more than 1 spriest probably isn’t that great of a guild, but if you get a slot good on you.
---
Let the mobs hit you for a couple seconds and then vanish, this usually works for me.
---
you can still do mind blast and flay without caring for the debuff limit
---
There are even some ghosts that can be bled. Inconsistent is an understatement for it.
---
Its not blizzards fault you have no life.
---
Youve probably have over 10 days played which means 5 hours on average every single day.
---
Log on to retail and do your daily quests then. Lol
---
Underrated comment.
---
That's probably true, but only because the nature of the pulls you would make with the team you describe doesn't fit/utilize what mages can do.
---
If you pull 2-3 mobs at a time and quickly cleave them down with no downtime, sure a rogue is better than a mage. But if rounding up 18 mobs at once, mages do a much better job of AoEing down in seconds, drink, rinse and repeat.
---
its hardcore cosplay
---
You can go 30/0/21 as soon as level 39.
---
Get some int gear and you can dps or heal every endgame dungeon!
---
I raided MC a lot in vanilla.  First PUG I put together on short notice for MC on a Monday before reset I got to the first boss and remembered that I forgot pretty much all the mechanics besides there was a curse.  Started looking ahead at a boss guide before reaching bosses after that 1st wipe (apparently nobody else remembered either the need for dispels for doom + MCs).
---
I am sure BWL and AQ40 will be the same way for me.  I had little experience in naxx to begin with so most of it will be new.
---
You can't do two actions that trigger GCD with one macro activation.
---
Lol you already tried to post this 3 days ago, thats a big yikes from me fam.
---
The same reason people need in the first place: gold.
---
OP clarified already that he gave the 2nd away though as they're all guildies.
---
yO tAuNt!
---
Why would you keybind a spell that can literally save your life and is generally used in "oh shit" moments ? Especially considering how many keybinds paladins already have ... Like 2 whole seals and a judgment.
---
its not a waste of time, I've had some good Duels with paladins, yeah you can hearth out to safety, and i don't get a kill but its been a good fight!
---
Can confirm that an alt used for auction house access, is indeed an AH alt. :)
---
They’re good people. I’m in the same guild as them and they’ve been nothing but pleasant and helpful.
---
It is when done optional.
---
How does that work with a class that's already low dps? Neutering your dps even more, when it's already low, is a bold strategy.
---
Sounds similar to a hunter on same server I encountered trying to tane a named bear everyone needed to kill for a Quest, reporting all of us for stopping his progression
---
Get shadowfoot stabber from AH and DM dagger with 6 to weapon skill for OH
---
even then, just gain distance and switch to balance spells for damage, tanks are easier for druids, just go for magic attacks and roots instead
---
Or maybe there's so few of them because there isn't any demand for them?
---
Real talk? Get a pet you like. It doesn't matter enough to min/max it. Want a tiger? Get a tiger and name it Tiggers or w/e. Want a bear? Get a bear.
---
This is obvious satire
---
Just curious. How did you convince your guild to give you this if it's your first run? I feel like people who raided for a while already would be salty. If you're an officer, they would feel it's loot council favoritism?
---
Bthe e 31
---
Yes it works. You need to quite significantly outgear the content though for it to work.
---
As I understand it, addons are only able to view newly created 24hr listings by searching without a filter, sorting by auction duration descending. As far as I know there is no API to query "new" auctions.
---
Blizzard could fix this in a couple ways: query rate limiting; or scrambling results for listings sorted by duration for over, say, 16 hours.
---
But they're Blizzard, so they won't. Sad lol.

It strikes me how many characters I encounter in WoW are warlocks which leads me to wonder how many of them actually are warlocks. I personally don’t care what hobbies people have, but I was just wondering.
---
I got an lock alt I usually use a 1button macro with cast sequence of /petattack/ immolate/corruption/curse of agony/!shoot. You can find it on online, if you won't, tell me and I will share it. Iam not on my computer now
---
An owl
---
It does like 3 less damage than a cat but a cat has less HP than an OWL, so an owl is more tanky which is ideal for leveling
---
Ontop of that an owl can learn Screech which is an AOE demo shout that is flammable and generates high amounts of threat.
---
And an owl can learn dive which is a charge like a warrior.
---
So an Owl has does slightly less damage than a cat, but hasmore HP, and can generate aoe threat which allows you multi pull and chain pull which is perfect for hunters.
---
I'm not sure I want a filthy dwarf bobbing my beautiful Night Elf apples.
---
B-but..he's a s-streamer!!4!
---
Hell even as a Horde
---
Go to teldrassil and get an owl
---
Coming from Mobas, I improved a lot by watching my own replays, so you could try recording your own gameplay footage. This will give you the ability to review your actions with no stress and without any stakes. This will not only allow you to focus on things, but you will also get a sense of when which class should use their cooldowns. If you expect something, you will notice the audio telegraph in-game and make a connection between the two in your head, even without directly looking for it.
---
I don’t think it’s as good in STV when you’re literally in a fucking jungle though. So many things to get stuck on and mobs to pull on you.
---
Force yourself to think of better character names.
---
My dad is server admin for blizzard he’s gunna IP ban ur ass
---
Pallys are freekills, all they do is delay the inevitable, bubble no 1, bubble n2, then lay on hands i feel like they always hope that you get bored and stop chasing as their only defense
---
You have to be over-geared and have great raid to pull it off
---
Ya it’s not so much as the damage behind it but because it uses a rebuff slot. It could push off a deep wounds but it could also push off a better rebuff instead and the deep wounds pops back up anyways, so it’s a safety measure to control the debuffs completely by just banning more than 4 curses. But freaking out about it on trash? Like ok dude
---
Your last 2 links are the same.
---
Standard pvp build is something around these lines:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/5100003-5002301-055403105015011
---
The reason for this is you want burst healing to stay alive, while having extra utility in feral charge, as well as the cheaper shapeshifting cost.
---
As for going for more DPS focus, without nature's grace you might be hard pressed getting a ton of spells off. And moonglow might be a better damage/healing route to take.
---
Damn dude, what a crazy thing to get salty over. You seem like a fun guy, I bet people love being around you.
---
Cya in 60 when WotLK hits!
---
In my experience questing with grinding. Go to area, get all quests... Kill everything do the quests you can...then go to next area. Some dungeons along the way if it fits in. 
---
Quests with crazy travel time and back and forth are fine the first time through, but skip for Alts imo.
---
Got my alt warrior to 60 in 7 days 12 hours doing this with Max engineering and herbing which I think is pretty decent.  Being funded by a main can help if your gear lags behind.
---
Depends on the spec and level obviously, but besides the most busted two classes in PvPPaladin is probably winning. (Hint they do Shadow damage over time.) Shamans are a motherfucker too, but it all depends on how many Cooldowns you have and are willing to blow.
---
I am and people do. Your post is shit, don’t deflect.
---
This is the equivalent of the real life left trying to ruin everything because muh fee fees
---
"twice as many rolls" the Main hand raid weapons from Onyxia both has 1/3 the droprate of perditions blade, and your typical raid comp would have more warriors than rogues to begin with due to warriors being a more popular class. The most meaningful upgrade by far is weapon upgrades.
---
Boars's are great. Junp from one enemy to the other with charge in seconds also great armoir
---
Torch is so easy though if they just LOS pull for you.
---
Shadow Priests and Warlocks quite literally kill everyone. If you check out the dueling league stats they are well over double the win rate of other classes.
---
The restaurant owner also supplies the materials to actually make the food. Your analogy is bad and you should feel bad.

---
How would they? All the addon does is use the default AH ui, just faster. Sniper just scans the newest posts on the AH, which you can do manually if you want.
---
Do people generally charge guildies for things like transmutes?
---
Your first misconception is that shadow is low dps. Of course multiple shadows aren't optimal. But you can still clear ultra fine with them.
---
Not sure about guaranteed victory but I am not going in if I know I am dying for sure. And as a warrior it’s almost certain I am dying against certain classes Or if it’s 2v1 or worse.
---
If you’re a Spriest or Warlock, sure. But they beat everyone.
---
Yes, but discounted.
---
lol good luck staying ahead of 1k dps horde warrior
---
also like the dude above said, DW = crushed. doesn't matter. more rage and more threat.

Sure, you might sell 2 for 500G. But I'd rather sell 200 for 50G

i loved this story, thanks for sharing lol

Tank shaman isn't needed, pallies with a taunt is much more in demand.

Streamers are cancer.

Cancer is toxic.

So fuck streakers and fuck whatever they do. I’m going to stay in my own lane, not follow them and enjoy the game. I suggest you do the same.

Can somebody link me a good AH guide. I feel like just having the addons and watching gold guides don’t really help. I wanna get a better understanding on how to play my specific servers market for gold.

What’s a Warrior realistically going to do that “destroys” a Paladin? We almost never lose to them 1 on 1. Mortal Strike is a lot worse against a class that can purge the debuff and heal for free. Plus we have a ton of armor. You’re either killing Prot Paladins without much damage or jumping them when they are low on resources (which is fair)
---
Who else should get it? The Ret paladin?
---
Ironic
---
I’m not American and your post is still a cell in the tumor growing in this sub.
---
Are people really watching because they think they would be good role models?
---
Atleast I personally dont care if the streamer is bad guild leader, criminal irl, cheats his wife or totally fake person. 
---
As long the stream is good and interesting, I watch. 
---
His tournament has been really good and hilarious.
---
As an alliance on Gandling EU I actually go gank low levels because I literally am unable to play/level in my appropriate zones during daytime because **there's death squads of 60's constantly patrolling them.** I got 11 hours /played on 59 now while genuinely trying to quest fast because am just sitting there waiting for my re-spawn timer half of the time.
---
I can only see one tumor cell
---
Streamers?
---
I’m sure it’s not the only thing they shove up their ass.
---
First step, invest few gold in big bags.
---
Go to badlands or swamp of sorrows or tanaris.
---
Kill everything you see, loot everything, mine everything. 
---
Sell everything to vendor exept valuable/useful greens and blues and mining materials gonna start selling for a bunch now so post these on AH.
---
You should run a lvl 1 char from starting zone to IF/SW in 5 minutes and send all items you wanna post on AH to this character. Free bag space and less travel time on your main!
---
You can go somewhere else, you can log out for a bit, you can ask for help from other players.
---
It happens, it sucks but there are ways around it which are very obvious.
---
I like to troll horde in a similar manner. I will mind control someone, sometimes near ledges. And then I'll just buff them with stamina and /cheer.
---
Go to Ironforge Military Ward, look at the floor that leads towards the BS and Flight Path, watch how it cuts off.
---
the reason is that i heard auto attacks do miss only with 6% when its "on charge" and 19% when its off?
---
Yes but normally it’s not worth it, using bash and Innervate is a nice tip if your healer is low on mana. Another thing you can do is bark skin and heal yourself if your healer is oom and you have no other options.
---
Remember to use cancel form macros, they make it a lot smoother.
---
I did that and was still a few hundred gold short when I hit 60 as warr.
---
As much as I thought the video was good, the only point I’d dispute is the “Streamers not leveling the way they advocate in videos.” Well, there’s a reason for that. They are all on PvP servers and broadcasting where they are for as many people as want to watch them. Not saying that stream sniping is a “bad” thing, but if a streamer wants to avoid it, they farm dungeons.
---
Time is money, so cost is not 0
---
For Ragnaros, how much do I need to invest in Fire Protection potions? Are the greater ones necessary, or can I make do with the regular ones + Fire Ward? Unsure of how much damage I really need to mitigate.
---
Or dm arena b4 anyone knew about it...
---
Challenging Roar?
---
How has pre-bis changed for warriors now that Dire Maul has been released? I'm starting to reach the levels where I should start looking for that.
---
Just checked my guilds logs from this week (we run 2 groups).
---
Melee hits were 35% and 37% of the total damage taken by the two different MTs.
---
I just got mine for 250 :)
---
Are there still people that didn't turn on chat class colors?
---
Oh, thanks! I didn’t know /who worked like that!
---
Maybe not on twitch as a whole but I would say in the classic realm of streamers he is
---
But ret scales horribly, even more so than hunters. Having a ret in AQ gear in Naxx is the equivalent of having a good fury warrior in pre-bis gear, possibly even worse if you are worldbuffed, and most guilds simply wouldn't be able to clear Naxx in greens and blues. While it might not be a hard raid by today's standards, it's not comparable to MC at all. Rets do fine now because early content has no DPS requirements, but in Naxx, rets are no more than raid mascots.
---
Probably bought it and sold it straight away
---
Am male, and almost always play male. Though I play a dwarf becuse I love thr beard look, but I can’t grow a beard in real life. :(

That's part of the pvp server exp. Alternatively you can chose a pve server.

---
Pretty sure he got caught lying about playing vanilla, someone found an old VOD of his where he said he started in TBC as well.
---
no, people arent laughing at you for single target grinding, i would venture that outside of aoe instance spam dungeons, most leveling is people single target, solo aoe grinding requires specifics that you won't find in every area, densely populated, melee only, with no stun/silence abilities. lots of places the mobs are either too far apart, or they have ranged attacks (shoutout to those annoying ogres who throw rocks at you that doesnt even count a spell so you can't counterspell it)  
---
and to be honest with frostbite and ice shards (critical strike talent) single target killing can be just as fast as aoe farming, just instead of a bunch of things dying all at once and then drinking/eating, you just kill one at a time and then drink after a few pulls  
---
aoe grinding is also a lot more dangerous, if someone is trying to pvp you while you aoe farm you're pretty much dead, but if you're single target farming you can deal with being pvp'd much easier  
---
TL;DR : nah bro, frostbolt away
---
We use Monolith DKP. It works really well imo. Users can see their dkp and any +- by hitting /dkp
---
I’m on mobile right now so I can’t really link but Everchosen has a good video going over a google doc that Simms your char under certain circumstances you can change as well as your gear. But right now hit is worth about 12 spell damage (not usually flashing and full world buffed, as well as not as much spell damage as later phases so it weighs less at the moment) and crit 13
---
I just use the addon bartender and put my attack and follow commands on the scroll roll thing on my mouse. This way I have full control over my pet
---
No way. I haven't kept my logs from last run but I'll get them tomorrow night. The difference in white damage is going to be negligible but the difference in backstabs is going to be very wide.
---
I accidentally had Finkle's Skinner equipped on Golemagg and my DPS was over 20% less than the previous week when I had Stabber equipped.
---
Either he hasn't, or he's doing something wrong. Take 2 quick steps away and vanish. Only really fails if the entire server lags.
---
EU when accepting refugees, sry, couldnt resist :D

Greater fire protection potion
---
Mostly referring to onyxia and ragnaros, also applies to greater arcane protection potions for shaz for melee.

we use monolith dkp and a discord event bot
---
You could try doing SM Graveyard a few times. Soon you can go to Arathi for a lvl or so.
---
Wtf
---
Cat with 1.2 atk spd easy to get, check petopia atk speed page. Dash, growl, bite, claw. Frenzy procs and good dmg for holding aggro.
---
Helm is garbage, sell it while you can before it needs to go to the vendor.

Even worse, they want to tryhard an extremely easy game
---
Turn up sound and mute ambience/music

Wouldn't say it's meaningless when it's 50% of the reason a druid is brought to raid (excluding the fact that they might be a nice person that you want to raid with).

This is doubly sad when you consider that this content could be cleared by chimps but they struggle precisely because they are led by actual morons.
---
I just wanted to clarify.
---
All three of these dropped in the same run. 3 packs in a row.
---
Yes- you’re not alone young padawan.
---
These are my two cents- TLDR- do some soul searching and play what YOU enjoy most; others can’t make that choice for you or tell you how you should spend your precious time. Yes, that sounds cliché and everyone says the same thing yet allow me to elaborate on that a little deeper.
---
Things to consider:
---
A) Leveling: Will you enjoy that class’ rotation, play style and efficiency during this lengthy process?
---
B) End game PVE/Raiding: 8 out of 10 times, you might be locked into a certain spec for raiding based on class. Will you be okay with THAT spec playing that class? Sure, you have more options if your guild is more casual and less demanding but at the end of the day- some classes and spec are more efficient than others for clearing content and raiding. Even if Classic content is “easier” than retail. AQ and Naxx are still challenging with gear leaps. 
---
C) Battlegrounds: Every class has its own bag of tricks and dependencies. It’s mostly paper-scissor-rock until you master your class and learn it very well. Yet sometimes, it will still be difficult to beat X class because of class design and how they have ways to counter you one way or another. 
---
D) World PVP: Same logic as battlegrounds can apply here as well. 
---
E) Farming Potential: Whether it’s gold for a mount, materials or recipes, you will have to do it at some point. 
---
F) Enjoyment: Do you see yourself playing X class 3/6/9/12 months from now?
---
G) YOUR availability: How much time do you have to play this game and to gear your character? This is crucial. I personally don’t have the time I used to while in college anymore. I can’t play play 10 hours a day and now have a lot more responsibilities, a full time job and a family to take care of. 
---
With that in mind, I’m still torn between a Warrior, Rogue and Mage to the point I created a spreadsheet with PROs and CONs.
---
On paper, I’m “supposed” to be playing a mage; my heart tells me rogue but my souls tells me warrior.
---
I’ve played warrior/rogue intensively most of my WoW life until I quit raiding early MoP, came back occasionally to do casual stuff but then quit the game soon after that. Bought Cata, played 2 weeks and quit again. Bought Draenor, played a couple of weeks and quit again. Didn’t even bother with Legion nor BFA. Never enjoyed healing after trying multiple times with all classes.
---
I heard Classic was a real thing and I couldn’t be happier, nostalgia instantly induced my brain and I just had to do it. I’m loving every second of it but I still can’t decide which to main.
---
Using the 7 key points above and narrowing down my personal experience, here’s what I know:
---
- If I had to choose one between tanking and dps, I’d choose dps yet because of my availability sometimes I wonder if I should stick with a warrior to tank since it’s faster to create your own dungeon groups as a tank for obvious reasons. This is only helpful while you finishing farming dungeons for pre-BIS and start raiding but do I really have the time to raid? Sure, if I find a guild that can do 2-3 nights a week late night raiding then I’m gold other than that, nope.
---
- Since I prefer to DPS, Warriors are still in the list since Fury is amazing and probably the top dps for quite some time along with rogues until mages get AQ/Naxx gear scaling with +spell damage and crit. At this point, mages probably go top with fury warriors and rogues fighting for the 2nd spot. Gear and skill play a big role here as well for the melee classes since mages will be mostly spamming fireball and scorch for stacks at this level of raiding- which could be boring for some people. Warrior and rogue rotation is a lot more interactive.
---
- As far as PvP goes, every class is gear dependent; not just warriors. While warriors do become S tier with a pocket healer in battlegrounds, they are not as good without one. Now, do I really want to depend on two factors- having a healer and depending on that healer to be “decent” to enjoy a BG? Hmmm, I wonder. 
---
In world PvP, you have to choose your battles as a warrior since fighting against a hunter, mage or shadow priest with equivalent gear and skill as you (for the sake of an example) will feel like an uphill battle where you have the short end of the stick. Rogues are S tier in world PvP and BG since they can choose their battles and  call when to engage and not to engage which is a huge plus in both BGs and World PvP to avoid downtime and death. It’s a different play style too since you have to pick the outliers and kill them instead of charging in like a warrior would. Mages are amazing in world PvP in the right hands and are pretty good in battlegrounds are well. 
---
- Farming with a mage outperforms every class, this is no secret. Rogues can go into dungeons and pick pocket and/or farm bosses to DE blues or sell them in AH to make a pretty penny but you need to have at least T1 equivalent gear to do this efficiently. 
---
- Leveling wise, warrior life is tough. No sustainability at all and you depend on getting hit to get rage. Only regular attacks and crits give rage as well but you’ll be spamming heroic strike for the first 40 levels. It’s slow and you’ll die quite a bit. Rogues are for sure better to level with and the same can be said for mages. Cooldowns and disengaging abilities help out a lot. 
---
With all that said, my warrior is lv 38, rogue is 14 and mage is 9. I’m thinking of making my rogue my main and level up the mage as an alt. Yet something still draws me to the warrior. 
---
So much analysis and still can’t make a choice. Kinda sucks...BUT it’s not the end of the world. Choose what you want to play now, if it changes tomorrow or a month from today then play that instead. Just have fun instead of worrying about what to play or what’s best. Play what you enjoy! Play whatever class gives you that “ oh shit that was fucking awesome” moment. I just get those moments from both warrior and rogue.
---
 LOL RIP brain.
---
Best mage name I've seen in a while.  
---
    
---
Also tell Hamannu (or w/e) and Arkyo I said hi :p
---
Sword spec is far superior for PvP due to the extra rage you get from a proc.
---
I haven't either.  It's something like 1 spawn per hour per zone iirc.
---
*could have
---
haha some guy on here a while ago said his gf made like 5? 6? gnomes and it still makes me chuckle.
---
Netfish and Gill...
---
Is there a guild log addon?
---
Ele shamans still use one hand plus shield.. Offhand BIS for healers is arguably the shield of the Goblin from Mara that gives mp5
---
Implying that the forsaken wouldn‘t actually enjoy testing one of their newly created mass destruction diseases on their fellow hordes
---
I dunno if I'd go with shunned. I definitely love having an spriest in my dungeons groups, as it means I have to do a lot less healing. However, you will kinda have issues finding raid spots. Most guilds want exactly one shadow priest for the shadow damage debuff, and they don't have the debuff slots for anything else. Even then, the dps you're providing to warlocks might not outweigh the dps they could get by just having another mage.
---
you have the drakestone allready?
---
I can only speak to my experience, but it depends on location. If we’re in a place where kiting has some obstacles, I ran down and killed them. If it was a place with no obstacles, they out range me and kite me down. At the same time though, I leveled with Engineering and had a ton of toys that most people don’t have while leveling.
---
But hey, everyone’s experience is different.
---
I see a lot of wpvp on DD. P2 gonna be nuts
---
No? I don't mind spending an extra few copper per item if it means I pay the people that undercut the way I prefer. I am most likely the worst one here. 
---
But it just remind me of a kid yelling "I will sell it for 1,99 instead of 2,00!" To try and get you to buy from him instead of the other guy.
---
Your comment doesn't have a verb.
---
I would peace the fuck out any guild that has a poor performing officer taking all the loot first.
---
3% not 3
---
Ok, now I really want a cosmetic aging system in WoW.
---
? grob is an rp-pvp server ?
---
Do some duels to get used to pvp'ing.
---
And siphon loot
---
thats what he said 5% Dropp chance of the cape itself and then the cape itself has a chance of 2% to be "... of shadowwrath " makes it a nice 0.1% Dropchance assuming the percentages given are correct.
---
My tip would be to put the macro with your Mark. So when you put the mark, you send your pet in as well.
---
Fake
---
These are children who don’t want to understand. Don’t even bother trying.
---
Or it’s just a game and ‘simple economics’ aren’t everyone’s concern. Some people just want to do good in this world and not everyone wants to capitalize on those less fortunate and less intelligent. The other end of the spectrum in your waitress/restaurant owner analogy is the volunteer who just wants to positively impact someone’s life. 
---
Maybe this game has more to teach you about the real world than the real world has to teach you about this game.
---
You don’t know what you’re talking about. Stop.
---
Yeah people having power really brings out the worse in them. This is especially true with those who aren't 100% qualified to lead in the first place, they make bad calls.
---
Yes. 14 years sooner. /s
---
Hi, /u/DeiVias
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dncbvw/there_is_a_special_place_in_hell_for_people_that/). 
---
My experience of grinding packs of 10-20 mobs today bears that out. If the proc chance were rolled separately on each mob, big pulls would give you clearcasting procs more often than not.
---
Rumor has it if you get 40 consecrations down at once, Tirion ascends from the holy grounds and s’mores down whatever threatens you.
---
After some testing I don't think you get a separate proc chance for each mob. It looks like a proc chance per cast.
---
Loot sluts
---
Goodbye
---
There will be new player while p4-6 im sure.. So dont worry about beeing behind.. Alot of guilds start raiding next year because they dont have the numbers now.. U will be fine
---
Healer, don’t need it fortunately
---
Not impressed
---
Shoulda seen my bags after grinded from 225-300...
---
Also his Paladin tanking video couldn't be further from the mark
---
for the clout QS is worth for any race, most iconic tanking weapon imo   
---
but for actual tryhard min/maxing there are better and easier/cheaper options to go for
---
Absolutely. However the default AH UI is just so shit that I think it's not reasonable for people to be forced to use it to have a "level playing field".
---
Now automatic AH sniping addons - that's a different beast. Some forms of AH sniping are more like botting.
---
I watched some of his youtube videos and thought it was really fun, i came to his stream after that and he was such a piece of shit to everyone and about everything. I am amazed that he can hide it on youtube but on stream he cant do shit about it, he just radiates being a dickhead.
---
try classicwow.live for reference if you ever need help
---
Was there too but I could bare kill wolfs with axes...  Over population and they never drop a thing...
---
Can you run 2 AH addons? I’ve been using Aux since launch so have built up a nice database of % prices, but have recently learned about TSM’s “sniping” feature to find absolute bargains, which I’d love to make use of. How can I do this? Hopefully Aux has a similar feature using a search string or something..
---
just out the ingame sound up, music etc off youlk hear it
---
Yeah i also grind on the zone of the Map quest. Being able to grind alone for hours is great. But i don't find it as lucrative as you since Meat in my server barely sells and when it does it's for 1.5s/ea
---
Get rekt?
---
in a normal guild a wel played ret can function perfectly, in semi-hardcore guilds they will fall off indeed, if you ret is doing less than 300 dps he is not putting in any effort.
---
They updated it like a month ago it’s been working just fine for me.
---
some rp’ers but mostly ppl don’t really care too much. Just don’t ruin someone else’s RP and you’ll be fine. Just like any other PvP server
---
that wasn’t even him
---
Thank you!
---
It’s crazy cuz the alliance do the same thing on my server
---
I've played a number of MMOs to end game. Some have add-on support, and some don't. I would say that on balance I prefer not having addons significantly more.  In particular I think these sorts of addons, as well as advanced macro spamming response addons, really are better off out of games.
---
People still make shit tonnes of money in games like SWTOR and FFXIV by gaming the markets, but it's not detailed spreadsheet madness and automates buy outs. It's much more manual and makes the market feel interesting.
---
they probably dont have ret memes, and also getting hand of rag probably loot locks people for a good while and atleast for all weapons, and most warriors want to go furry dual-wield instead of arms 2 handing maces, so probably everyone else passed it.
---
Other typos I can live with but this just hurts my brain..
---
pretty insane that we have 3 hand of rags now on zandalartribe alliance side, i think i saw you in ironforge yesterday with it!
---
Brow is a bit redundant here, no?
---
&gt;If you trust someone with your mats and they steal them, they’ll likely get away with it.
---
no, they won't. They can, have, and will be punished over things far far less valuable than sulfuron ingots
---
&gt;I reckon most people are 60 by now and have some gear. 
---
Wrong!  
---
in vanilla wow, at least in the 1st year there will ALWAYS be players at each lvl bracket. 
---
3 weeks ago (or whenever you stopped playing) you were ALREADY behind the hardcore frontrunner.  and behind the players just behind them.  and behind the players behind that 2nd group.  AND behind... etc.  
---
But you were ALSO in front of the players behind you, loads of them.   
---
Drop the mindset that you need to be on par with Some Random Guy because you are You.  You play at your speed and that is fine, there will always be plenty of players around your level.
---
The only exception here is if you want to play with a close real life friend, then it's annoying if one is lvl 40 and the other lvl 20 or 60.  But in that case you will find a way, since you are friends.
---
- In world PvP, you have to choose your battles as a warrior since fighting against a hunter, mage or shadow priest with equivalent gear and skill as you (for the sake of an example) will feel like an uphill battle where you have the short end of the stick. Rogues are S tier in world PvP and BG since they can choose their battles and  call when to engage and not to engage which is a huge plus in both BGs and World PvP to avoid downtime and death. It’s a different play style too since you have to pick the outliers and kill them instead of charging in like a warrior would. Mages are amazing in world PvP in the right hands and are pretty good in battlegrounds are well. 
---
Damn Karen is in copper ore industrie
---
Ha! Zinger
---
Yh I use TSM for prices and sniping, Auctionator for posting
---
Get 6k mana and you will kill a pack with holy nova, bar 1 or 2 that need 1 hit with wand. PI is not required, it's only to make up a shortfall in mana.
---
If you get 6k mana with inner focus you're fine. 6.6k and you won't need to use cooldowns.
---
Arathi is a pretty small insignificant quest zone, at 30 I'd recommend probably rebel camp quests and the first nessingwary quests in stranglethorn then desolace and then shimmering flats and then back to stranglethorn.
---
Ah the video is what I did 6 years ago, when I was alone in my house and taunting idiots. Spot on.
---
Actually one of the best things about games back then, especially MMOs is not everyone needs to be able to beat everyone.
---
It's an rpg, you have your strengths and warlocks have theirs. Everyone needing to be good at everything is why retail is boring
---
If your raid isn't organized enough to have healing groups, you shouldn't use hots anyway. Any hots you put out are gonna get wasted by people throwing out a heal. Usually the tanks will get hots, and the rest of the raid will get downranked healing touches.
---
Also 4 druids is...a lot. I've been raiding with as the second healing druid and it feels crowded, I can't imagine having two others. Find some paladins or priests.
---
They built the tower then they started building the spiral ramp down.
---
And the spiral ended where it ended.
---
They should have gotten an engineer.
---
have a nice and tidy UI can help. Some useful addons as well. Try using your character and target frames closer to your character or changing your UI with bartender or Dominos addon. Also try OmniCC, which will show CC durations on the enemies frame. Also watching some guides and knowing basic rotation can help a lot. Knowing how to counter certain classes can help take off some stress too. For example as a hunter you want to stay in within a dead zone if u ever fight a warrior so he can’t charge or auto attack. Hope this helps
---
It's a preview mode so you can position stuff without being in an actual raid. Type /luna and go through the settings or just tick the Lock box.
---
Apparently the author is banned on curse so the addon is no longer there.
---
Maybe if you had bigger totems this wouldn't have happened.
---
This isnt the prebis neck for shadowpriest btw
---
Dude. MC and BWL will be on farm for the entirety of classic. You’re fine
---
I wish there was a lower jaw bone floating in the tub.
---
&gt;must of 
---
Must have
---
Probably himself or one of his buddies
---
He was playing day 1...
---
Wow okay, having a hard time at work buddy?
---
My favorite part is "you receive loot copper ore"
---
Care to link your spec? I'm hoping to hit 60 soon and was thinking about 0/30/21 when I get there.  I heard it was easily enough for MC and allows you dungeon and PvP utility outside that without needing to respec all the time...
---
Yes they do. Especially undead rogues vs alliance warlocks.
---
I like it!
---
if you grab aggro near a node, at least drag the mob you are fighting OVER the node, that makes it clear you intent to mine it.  I noticed that works usually because  it feels more like stealing to another person who would mine it. It makes it more of a obvious dick move.  (still within the rules of course, we are talking about etiquette here, not law)
---
Maybe if your warriors don't do anything but auto... Warrior DPS is well over half the threat talked about here and that's before sunder/HS threat modifiers. You would probably need to stack 12+ of a single class for this to be at all useful and even then it still isn't useful in the slightest.
---
In my opinion going back is not worth it. Farming gold in any way and buying lower level stuff is more efficient.
---
I was just going off old wow classic database comments originally, personally I have no idea how much they're worth. Il probably stick it on AH then for 300g and hope it gets a buyout as it's probably going to be the only one on there. Thanks.
---
i stayed til wotlk, also horde. who was your main?
---
Proof? Because I clearly remember it being strictly the cast bar and absolutely nothing to do with the animations.
---
&gt;you can definitely clear them with 30 people + 10 shadow priests
---
This is the preferred raid composition for all guilds of excellence.
---
assmong doesnt upload his own wow streams to yt and allows others to do so and profit from it.
---
Weaboo detected
---
"Yelling" is a pretty huge overstatement.
---
first come first served.  If I see somebody fighting something above a node, I let them have it.  But if they are &gt;10 yards away I don't feel they own it.
---
Always makes me laugh when Horde players say they are the pvp faction because of their racials, and then they encounter literally any wpvp or bg situation involving a pally and just lose horribly because they didn't anticipate how one class could massively tip the balance in Alliance favor, and they expected all their fights to be 1v1 duels against non-pallies. Kudos for showing those Horde who is *actually* boss of pvp :)
---
For hord, because of windfurry totem. 
---
I doubt you got any parses for alliance where it’s usable.
---
On my Vanilla server (Argent Dawn) they went for 50-75g commonly... the only reason they’re going for more is because people understand it is BiS for feral Druid tanks for Hy he entirety of classic.
---
I’ve been on the receiving end of a similar scam in retail a few years ago. My gold was restored and the other party received a ban.
---
How is getting items that make Ironfoe look like an item dropping all the time not big news?   
---
Do you understand what 0.1% dropchance means?
---
Thank you!!!
---
Well if hes criminal irl; then youre like a person knowlingly supporting mafia buying their shady products from their shady companies; ethically youre guilty of supporting his activities
---
Dude Mages are op i swear ;)
---
fade?
---
They first write their rant and only THEN they put you on ignore.  because the rant is usually badly written and rather long, it takes some time to read and formulate a reply, so they have plenty of time to ignore you
---
Brb gonna go bath in a tub
---
The worst thing in the entire video is him saying "everyone shut the fuck up"... What am I missing here?
---
It's sitting in a box somewhere back in Trisfal Glades. 
---
in my original notes there was going to be a whole other horde player contaminating the tub but I had a guild run to do so I rushed it. That would have been an easy to draw compromise.
---
/w %T  'Some Text'
---
/ignore %T
---
That's fuckin stupid, cuz come phase 2 there won't be anyone to PvP. Except Grizzly, doubt they're leaving but they probably will love it lol
---
a float is a type of water vessel or a data type. if rolling a float, highest probably implies kayak...return how to roll a kayak. \~ Canadian Google 
---
damn that algorithm is good
---
Does it work any better if you buff the group of hunters with salv rather than Kings?
---
1. Hes shit at the game and is just riding the popularity.  
---
2. Him and his family scammed https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb1wud3n0NM  
---
3. His first ever duel tourney he didn't pay out the prize in full and banned who ever talked about it.  
---
4. Makes me sick that he has all these volunteers carrying the duel tourney while he sits back and racks in the free money and fame lmao.
---
That’s so awfully kind and he gets the added accolades of joy uploading it himself.
---
Is your character race the same as yours?
---
When I had a character in vanilla i made him old, but it was too late before i noticed what i did, and i always thought my character looked awkward.
---
For classic i had have a throwback and made the oldest character I could lol
---
?? Never happened .Sylvanas loves elves and has sworn revenge on Arthas ,hopefully she kills him
---
That's when you buy it all out and slap a higher price to drive up the market value.
---
Gnomish or goblin engineering for someone who is PvE focused but will PvP a bit
---
Alch from 0 to 300 costs less than 100g
---
So yesterday I had the fortune of buying the Helm of Narv (13 agi, 32 stam, 18 spirit, 309 armor) for only 9 gold. I was wondering whether it is worth keeping and equipping this helm for PvP, especially with the upcoming phase 2, or is it better to try and resell it? The average price on my server is about 40-50g currently. 
---
I thought cats don't like water
---
_CRAWLING IN MY SKIIIN_
---
Ask your guilds mage CL. Depends a lot on your raid's DPS and how long your healers can go on. If your healers have to pop major mana pots and demonic runes every Rag then you're just pushing the problem to someone else.
---
With ClassicCodex you have a predefined map where stuff can spawn. 
---
Bind herbing and mining to mousehweel and down and just ride around. After a couple days you know the herb and ore spawns and dont even need tracking anymore (although it helps).
---
Do the raids first before deciding to lead them.
---
this is great and i love you 10/10
---
Vendor trash isn’t gonna make you rich over night, but adds up over time. So empty to full bag looting everything you can and selling it is sort of worth it in the long run. 55 plus the vendor weapons are 1g each. A lot of white common items are mats for cooking and crafting and can be ok money as well.  
---
I herb/ skin my self, and while it undeniably it is one more click per mob for looting (to skin), there are lots of times when there are dozens of things around left over from other people’s kills to skin. Free money bascially. rugged leather and endgame scales are good for some easy g as well. 
---
Herbs / miner can be done but you need addins like *gatherer* to sort of show you were spawns could be (it doesn’t let you track both at once, it just has data about where things have been seen before). Once you start running the material routes (you can find maps online) in your go to areas the add on has enough data to really help you spot stuff even though you aren’t traditionally tracking it. You can probably find full profiles you can install with the add on google or on forums or from a guildmate who may have been using it since launch. 
---
The long con for a D/E bot is to level an alt to 35ish, train up in uldaman and then just mail all your worthless greens to that character. Then you also get all the bank space so it can become very handy.
---
You can put them on friends and then shift rightclick their name
---
Tailoring is not that useful unless you can get your hands on some rare recipes. There's currently one BoP crafted chest (Robe of the Void) that's great for locks, but that's it. Making mooncloth is like 10g every 4 days on my server which is better than nothing, but yeah.
---
These add-ons are freely available to everyone and work only within the bounds set by blizzard. Blizz has even restricted those bounds many times when they felt some add-ons had too much leeway. 
---
There's nothing wrong with auction house add-ons.
---
it isnt.
---
At 46 you can tank ZF, from around 48+ you can tank Mara and 52+ you can tank ST.
---
If you're looking to grind a few levels you're looking for somewhere with lvl 44 humanoids with a good respawn rate. Tanaris pirates are probably good but there's usually a lot of competition with mages for those.
---
Is anyone going to point that name out
---
Wait really? Where can you find this stuff out before it happens. I’m on that server!
---
I feel like it makes you borderline weeb too since you noticed
---
Congratz m8 , sad i couldn't be there
---
I see. Are battlegroups a part of classic?
---
Never heard of this guy and i watch streamers ,yeah seems very toxic..He charged that shit in race for dps and blames others after lol.
---
You guys can find more info here. Stop supporting this subhuman. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb1wud3n0NM
---
You are bot entitled to a drop worth several hundred gold. I owe you nothing and chances are someone else is gonna ninja them anyways and I'll feel like an idiot for greeding.
---
Get off your high horse. If you want the most sensical loot rules go with a premade.
---
the 21 resto is cookie cutter for the hybrid raid healer.  So you should be fine.
---
how does this work?
---
I was using Salv.
---
&gt;I honestly don't know how you can feel like the single target threat is so bad
---
Because autoattack + judgement is literally your only decent source of ST threat outside of Consecrate. And early-game right now, there's very little spell damage gear available, so your threat is going to be awful.
---
Is jump runs with paladin tank and disc priest doable? Me and my friend had trouble with zevrim, any tactics for doing him easier?
---
that doesnt even make sense. the honour will still be 0.
---
Ulduar patch, I think. I clearly remember doing the Tournament dailies in off-spec.
---
Vendetta? Why was someone trying to sell that for 126g? It's not even a twink weapon. Most Pservers would have it for 5g or less.
---
Yes, I just ignore shadow priests that whisper me. Not that they're not okay but its the same as warriors who solely dps. Roll on your dps gear im fine with that but atleast be flexibe when you can be.
---
"wahh auction addons are bad! having to sift through 20 pages one-at-a-time is good!"
---
Okay, you do that then.
---
One more question which dps meter are you using ?
---
It's viable. That's all you need unless you're playing this game for money and/or fame
---
Alliance gives you mace spec as well
---
Its the druid life man. On the other hand i know that i wont get the 1h from MC till all the shamans have it. A good alternative is the 2hander from magmadar but you cant get that either before every mage that doesnt have mageblade gets that. There are pros an cons. Maybe you play a mage or whatever and have a loot of competition for tier gear but on everything else you also know that you CAN roll on that, the competition on those items might be even higher but st least you CAN roll on them. Not so much druid. Of course there are guilds who probably dont care but usually its how it works.
---
Well the same goes for Sulfuras. We had BRE and not the eye. Sulfuras on a warrior is disappointing because the mace specialization is disappointing. Sulfuras is a good weapon but not really amazing. BRE, Ashkhandi, DEoI are vastly superior to Sulfuras.
---
To me it is just a guild banner to show dedication and investment.

You gain nothing from disliking something. No one wants to hear about how you don't like something and you gain nothing from wallowing in your dislike of something.

Down vote and move on. Adding your negativity to the thread does nothing.

skeletons on friend is ok until they proc an on-hit like a frost shield or something then the cleaner comes and ruins your day

Reading comprehension. You're making a few too many assumptions. The man's main inquiry is if AHK is bannable because he has seen wave bans. Fair leave it like that and don't judge. 
---
Next he ask the why should it be bannable because he uses it to stay in line. The question is if he not wanting to wait or does he not wait. The statement that everyone should wait because he doesn't want to is you projecting how he is behaving. No, the 60 sec auto jump is utilized to wait, mind you. Lets jump to AHK later. Everyone here has to be doing something to not afk. You are not taking please in waiting. You are not altruistic . Im bringing this up not because of the writer but because you brought up this because when someone is using AHK it is because he does not want to wait and ones who do not use autohotkey do want to wait. Yet the question barring whether or not AHK is bannable is what are ye method of staying afk? hitting the spacebar every six seconds, lets say AHK is not bannable, would you take that method? if yes, a hypocrite. You are only doing it because it is against the rule and not because of a moral principle otherwise you would never use that method.
---
Now to AHK,  it remaps keys, creates macros (pushing one key will produce a series of actions) I would say this macro method is bannable bc it violates the 1 key press leads to no more than 1 action. The internal macros in WoW do not violate this.
---
So why is AHK a concern? Its main concern is it may give one an unfair advantage do to automating an action vs the human doing it. The AFK is bannable because one can stay not AFK when before that he could've logged out and freed the queue for someone else. 
---
He is using AHK while at work and ... If he uses it occasionally while he is using the restroom to to stay out of the office or whatever but he will get back to the line just says he does not want to lose his place in line. If he is using it for a quick  2 min break  ye but he is using cut in line or.  
---
Quick conclusion, He's partitioning his argument into a few points. You lose me when you just glare over the and jump straight to your conclusion with no basis.
---
I am wouldn't  use autohotkey as an afk tool myself  but only when banbanabe. Call it empaty but its more accurately guilt.
---
Under cutting by more than 1c makes your item stand out
---
go to a city gates and join the duel clubs. you get used to the more frantic section of the game in a safe environment.
---
I would advise against doing this. Nobody is gonna buy 18slot bags for 300g+ (which is bascially the costs of mats) since onyxia bags exist. I have the recipe and I've been the only one on my servers listing the bags for mat costs+40g for weeks, and I didn't sell one.
---
I'm a computer nerd, I have an MIS degree, a great career working in IT that pays well and I enjoy playing video games during some of my free time.  I'm not really sure how nerd can be used as an insult, honestly.
---
Inarva is our PvP Lead, so whilst he hasn't been raiding with us, he has been organising our guild's and larger realm PvP events in the meantime.  Not to mention the other person who was planning to get this weapon recently won Bonereaver's Edge.
---
Buying from the AH means some gold just disappears into AH fees. If you want to be a bro to the seller you'll buy it from him directly  for the same price as AH and they will profit more than they would otherwise.
---
&gt;Any guild that is taking more than 1 spriest probably isn’t that great of a guild, but if you get a slot good on you.
---
Any guild that needs to minmax in classic wow probably isn't that great of a guild
---
Oh I realise that, otherwise they wouldn't be in the game. That doesn't mean I have to like them or that I have to believe that they enhance the gaming experience. I feel like they do the opposite but like I said, that's just my opinion.
---
How does that even work considering they can't see them? Also I heard thorns work fine.
---
I was Rank 14 on my bankchar and had two black scarabs.
---
Based on the info in the video it’s around 80k.
---
Same original founders from Kronos 3.  However, they stopped playing and the guild was continued thereafter.  We have a few players from the K3 iteration within the guild.
---
Just a game bruh, it’s only mc.
---
On stallag as well and I get a sense of dread whenever theres a queue.. I just know there's gonna be two dozen horde camping menthol harbor flight path smacking every dipshit who gets off their bird. I don't even get mad anymore when I get swarmed. It's part and parcel of life on this server. Ohhh wanna go to ZF? Prepare to get smacked by Undead Mage named Ketamine who's exalted with gadgetzan and blows you up as soon as you get off the bird. Take a deep breath.. /spit on him and move on with your life.

Reminds me of this machinama

There are about 5-7 youtube accounts that all get 2 million+ views a month from doing exactly this and this alone. Most of the time they dont even edit but just take 20 minutes of the stream when he's doing something and then upload it.
---
It became a guild effort to craft our first legendary.
---
feral is more efficient, but you can kill things well quicker with a couple of starfire crits
---
You could have said this in so many other ways, without coming off as a dick, and without postulating things you evidently don't know. But no, you just had to pick the worst possible way
---
Not everyone works with coding, and it doesn't make you a genius if you do. Stop being a dick
---
Satyr's Bow is easier to get than Blackcrow, but Riphook is still BiS for most warriors
---
Eldritch Reinforced Legplates are a good alternative to Devilsaur if you're going with Edgemaster's
---
Tarnished Elven Ring can be better than Blackstone Ring, I'm personally using it
---
As a lvl 53 or so Tauren Druid, I once had a lvl 60 Gnome (Warrior iirc) stand next to me, help me finish the mob, then ask me through emotes whether I wanted the herb I was standing on. There was no other Horde around, so she could've just ninja'd it while I was fighting, or even easily killed me.  
---
I *did* want the herb, but I was so taken aback by her niceness that I let her have it.
---
no.  I think it's because you can whisper people on your friend list from other servers these days.  (or even from other games, like one is playing hearthstone and you are playing wow.)  So the server name is added because people have the same names
---
To be an ass.
---
Just last night I was in the middle of fighting off two mobs that were on top of an herb just to watch as a shaman ran up and started taking the herb. I said something only for them to reply "Unlucky" and run off leaving me to continue dealing with the mobs.
---
If there's one thing this game has taught me it's that there are far more sociopaths in our midsts than I originally assumed.
---
Pretty sure this is way off. It’s closer to 25
---
Priests have better spirit than druids (They get 1 mana per 4 spirit, druids get 1 mana per 5 spirit)
---
On top of that they get healing power by spirit, which causes them to itemize for spirit.
---
If you are sure no healer will need the mana you can also give it to a mage.
---
Depends on what class you are. Before Giantslayer it's one of the best Hunter PvP helms.
---
no, in the alliance zones, gnome mages pee in the water and then sell it as the new lvl 55 flavour
---
?? im 50, not specced into balance, and i can AoE Grays en mass (6-7 at a time) with hurricane and finish in bear.
---
You can't reliably fight back, because you need to stand in the same place or the guards will get you. This is literally the reason these nerds are doing this because they know that they will have such an extreme advantage that their low skill won't matter.
---
This is also why it's against the rules by Blizzard.
---
We aren't the majority but we're definitely active in slaughtering Horde on Herod.
---
Rogue here, its fun. Even more so if i wait for you to walk back and do it again (until you spirit rez) then im over it.

Who knows if there will be a good moonkin to clear their reputation, I hope so.

Yep, and that makes for a total of 1.5 levels of rested xp

Having no life doesn't make someone more talented

It ends up with undefined behavior if the two floats collide. It's astronomical as the guy said, but the way to guarantee it would be to loop until you get two different rolls

Keeps the code cleaner imo

I upvoted the post so it stays up longer.

Cool I didn't know that!
---
I'm close to level cap now and I can tell you from my personal playthrough that using a cat works just fine. I'm on Horde side so I didn't end up getting an owl till much later in the game but they also work extremely well. Like other people are saying, use what you want. Right now I have one of the wolves from SFK, Broken Tooth, and an Owl from felwood and I swap them out pretty often to make they they are all leveled up evenly and just depending on what I need at the time.

Great rebuttal to his argument. Sad

I am a hunter :) Sorry I didnt mention it originally

I wish addons in general werent a thing.

var @the motherfucker needs to be overruled, Join “Firemaw EU” instead, he can’t handle being a public mod he is to emotional and corrupt and biased as fuck, shady little POS

&gt; Like seriously Target...how fucking hard is it to tell your programming guys "we have 16 units of this to sell. Put a cap of 16 online. Don't let us sell 20,000 then have to refund the rest."

As someone who's worked on a gigantic e-commerce website, this made me laugh. If only it were that easy!

Sure, MC and Onyxia. In BWL I'm sure it'll drop quickly to only 5 Shadow Priests!

Compared to Ally, Horde very rarely get ganked.

The timing matches up. Thank god I'm a warrior.

But the best in slot list I've googled sixty times says it isn't good, why would you do that!?

Relax Reddit, let people play and do what they want. This isnt world first mythic raiding, it's molten core. Congrats on the weapon!

If you sold it prior to Dire Maul release you would have seen a lot more money for it.

DM has a maul with slightly reduced stats to make it competitive with Warden Staff.
---
Dunno.. I had a friend watching and they aggro'd onto him and he just said invisible mobs were attacking him.. the 2nd time they aggro'd onto him the cleaner came and wiped us all up.. not sure what the difference was tbh.  We speculated it was because he put up a mage shield or something at some point
---
For me I use a massive tv as a monitor so I just play windowed

Me male
---
Ever since I started putting allot of thought into my characters I only play as male because I believe thier models look allot better and all the worthwhile  backstories I think of ,I picture staring a male. 
---
Would still have a female NE took if thier models where not mere skin and bones
---
Come to Grobbulous. Never a dull moment.
---
thats literally what its like in retail right now. Doesn't help
---
I'm not sure either. Maybe your pet is positioned too close to the pool? Try pulling the lasher just as hydrospawn is heading back to the far end of the pool maybe.
---
lol im gonna waste 20 minutes getting back to where i was because le epic trole, enjoy no kill credit nub
---
There is the Booty Bay Gazette, but there is a (small) subscription cost and I'm not sure that any addons link to it yet.
---
Only problem with the backwoods helm is that it looks like garbage
---
So how do you convince guild to give you one of most powerfull weapons in 3 days of raiding?
---
What's the discord? :d
---
I know dogs don't like warm soapy water.

Cold algae filled water? They love that.

Who?  Why should I care?

I feel like this will be a new meme, if it isn't already
---
Catch up with the available content my good sir.
---
It heals you for the amount of damage dealt
---
Nah I agree. It boiled down to red vs blue at the end.
---
Find a pet with taunt. Then go find a boar and teach the boar taunt. Best pet to lvl with.
---
I think he meant the text referring to the definitely above age Orc

The toxicity seeps in. So far I’ve had a fairly wholesome experience with classic.

Then I see these kinds of posts. 
---
The angry player is raging against another player for what is essentially bits of data. 
---
It’s nice that we live in a world where people are able to focus so much emotion into such a minute thing; and that thing isn’t even tangible!
---
Misconception? Compared to paladins and shamans yeah it's not low. But it loses to every other class by a substantial margin.
---
Wow, thank you for this awesome reply!
---
like the cheese that forms in the milk container in my coffee maker when i forget to remove it.
---
Actually that is how it works, you can claim ignorance.
---
When did they switch the prices of mounts and riding? Because I remember abusing that on at least one of my characters, but can't remember if it was for the epic mount or the flying mount
---
You can instantly tell how genuine and passionate Kargoz and Defcamp are. Kargoz' decision to not play on the big streamer server Faerlina speaks volumes in and of itself already.
---
There is no way to tell the faction balance on a server and I doubt any of them are 50/50

"The TipsOut of YouTube and Twitch, is very different from the TipsOut of not YouTube and Twitch. So the way we run the guild here, I know I'm a nice guy and stuff on Twitch and YouTube but here it's very, very different. Please don't make the mistake that I'm the nice Twitch streamer that, you know,  blah blah blah, "hey guys it's Tips," no none of that here."
---
I could understand if he said "when we raid, I will be focused and will expect all of you to be as well" or something along those lines. Essentially admitting that his Youtube/Twitch persona is a nice guy front though? I'm not listening to anything else he says.

Warrior Life at 60 – Could some of you higher/geared people elaborate a bit more on the life of a warrior at 60? I'm currently at 30 and like the challenging aspect of levelling and even have a personal healer with me. Right now I'm just wondering how my perception of the lvl 60 lifestyle differs from reality. I'd love being a Fury Warrior that can also Tank from time to time (Especially dungeons) and maybe do some PvP. Is it necessary for me to respec each time? Is it worth to invest my time into this character, solely from the perspective of being good at all three aspects of the game? While money shouldn't be that big of a problem (got another Warlock that can farm later on) I don't really want to respec every other day just to tank a dungeon or run a raid. So – how's life at 60 for you guys? :)
---
So strange seeing someone say class lead.
---
I never played vanilla, but even when I was doing progression raiding in WOTLK and Cata that was not really a thing any longer.
---
I cannot wait to hit 60... 2 months to go
---

Horde doesn't even use the imp slam spec, specifically because they have windfury. Horde 2h fury = hamstring spam, alliance 2h fury = imp slam.
---
&gt;This fight was hard 15 years back because people were terrible and played on terrible hardware. 
---
And the gear was terrible. That's the reason why everything is so easy now.
---
Private server chimps are the worst WoW demographic bar none
---
So you're saying that life as a mage sucks at 60?  
---
Is that what you're saying? ;o
---
I'm there with you, thought he was a cool guy but I saw his true self in that raid. Besides, almost all of his "tips" are backed by incorrect information from private servers. I've tried using his old guides on how to level and they do not apply in real classic
---
Eh just looking for a rough estimate. I thought there might have been charts too online of the realms. But yeah just looking for peoples personal opinions on their own realms basically. :)
---
The long story short is:
---
Goblin = offensive 
---
Gnomish= utility 
---
Many of the gnomish items are BoE so Goblin is probs your best bet... however, if you have the money, other strategy is to roll gnomish, get everything you want and then re level again in Goblin 
---
Because of the grenades, goblin will be where you want to end up though really + you get the jumper cables  for the clutch res
---
what server?
---
I’m on deviant Delight horde.
---
Absolutely no problem and thank you so much for the answer! Def. helped me out nevertheless :)
---
&gt;Just gotta farm Gnomer. 
---
nah
---
Javel, how long did it take to farm Tidal? I've checked it often even after server resets, but havent even seen him yet. I struggle to just sit there and spam /tar macro for hours, always get sucked into doing something else! Care to share your strat/story?
---
Love the vids, keep them coming!
---
That's some boomer shit
---
Where is the best place for rogue specific information? YouTube channels, forums etc.
---
I’m disappointed there’s no Freshprince

Deviant delight horde. It was one of those servers they added later on I think.

I joined a guild that was allready starting naxx in late vanilla and had no 'progress' on anything before that because I just got carried. I wasn't meant to play in Naxx either, they just happened to have a free spot. 
---
So while I did do all those raids in Vanilla, I don't remember having a hard time. I was more like the 'I'm helping' dude from the meme.

yea you got plenty of greys to sell and eventuallly greens and epics.

As a hunter with a boar, what other pets should I tame to get skills for him, yes I'm sticking with Mr. BoarisJonson

we have 1 shadowpriest in our raids, and he does ridiculous DPS. was one of the first priests to get benediction. so if you like it and are good at it, im sure there is a guild looking for you.
---
I started playing the game i think in January or February 2007 which was either the month or a month after the release of The Burning Crusade so my knowledge of Vanilla mechanics is actually pretty good despite never having played it, Karazhan was my first raid and despite being a new player and never finding a hardcore guild i feel like i did pretty damn well for myself, fairly sure i had the #2 Bristleblitz Striker on horde side, i was friends with people from the #1 guild on the server, the infamous Vicarious guild that gave Thori'dal to a rogue, been playing Classic with one of those friend
---
We've all been there. I ran into some roadsigns in Orgrimmar last night chatting to the guildies. XD
---
This might be the sole reason why he's so big. I didn't know his name until recently but I've seen his face in countless YT thumbnails.
---
Can't say the same about streamers who just upload on their own account.
---
#1 on the server of their faction seems much more likely. If it's not entirely made up.
---
With good planning or a leveling guide the two things should combine.. Not every area is perfect (like in STV you got quest to grind every single beast in the forest) but it's manageable.. Of course you should avoid taking one quest at the time and returning right after completing it.. Get questie, collect all the quests in the zone, open the map and decide the order to do them all (and eventually turn them in if you pass by the city or you need to vendor stuff)
---
Thanks :)

Gives me something to do when the ganks get too bad.

Felwood is the last place I'd expect to get called out for my terrible ~~driving~~ riding
---
I don’t know what your expecting checking the ah this early in the morning.
---
Competition is tough! Been raiding for a little while now, and all I have to show is a Netherwind Crown and two Arcanist pieces that I only wear in pvp/AoE. But I am still having a blast, I have my raid spot locked in as the guild's Winter's Chill mage, and I will wait for gear for as long as I have to!
---
Its only harassment if you prevent him from beig able to play for over 24h.  This person is just a “ let me speak to your manager “ type of person.   Funny how he whispers the person instead of just reporting them.
---
Lol this has been an on going thing
---
Is blacksmithing useful for anything else? How expensive is to level?
---
So far from what I can find from 3 week old data and a small collection of new data your sever has about 3000 alliance and about 2500 horde. I'd say there is probably a bit of player drop off since these numbers; however, your server looks like it has relatively lower level players as well. As of 3 week ago you had mostly players under 30. Even if 25% of those players grinded hard to 60 since then you still have quite a high pop of below 60. Typically expected from one of the "later" released realms compared to launch. I definitely wouldn't say dead, but definitely emptier then the few orginal realms such a faerlina and those ones....but you don't want to play on those "streamer" bs realms. Lol
---
How can I make beginner money in the first 20 levels
---
I have no clue about retail. Maybe im wrong but I doubt it
---
No, in this comment thread we talking running BRD instead of questing in winterspring. My point is you're already taking an xp cut by running BRD instead of soloing so you can get a low drop rate bis item, might as well add a couple minutes to the run and farm the other low drop rate bis item.
---
It took me like 50 runs of Living to get the neck, didn't saw the cape drop once and it took me another 40 runs of UD to get thet hat from Magistrate...
---
think of all the hair left in there after
---
How long did this take you?
---
its very slow, there were several times i got so frustrated in the 40s/50s i almost walked away. stick with it, dps/tanking at 60 is fantastic.
---
Dude get bagnon
---
Takin a real long time with that key binding advice mate...
---
You're only looking at it from the side of making the most money possible. Most people don't care and just want to sell quick. And if 2.2g is the usual price then the market worked itself out. It was going to happen eventually.
---
How did you get the gold?
---
What addon are you using to see their talents?
---
Just want to add that offhand sword procs attack with your mainhand.. not your offhand which is infinitely better for the spec, but does not proc your oh poison faster
---
I see, gratz! It really is awesome to accomplish things like this as a guild!
---
His class guide videos are soooo bad. I didn‘t play vanilla for years and even I realised a lot of errors in them. Tbf it‘s fine to create content with some mistakes. Nobody is perfect but having such a big ego and being toxic at the same time is just frustrating
---
Thank you for your post. Kinda. Breath of fresh air lmao. The streamer severs I wanna avoid too. That seems a little much. I’ll just keep doing my research. I’m trying to find the perfect realm to transfer too.
---
Please die.
---
I read somewhere that they have a massive horde majority - is that true?
---
Worried Id have no allies to pvp with ;)
---
Rogue
---
Wow, people actually attacking the enemy faction?  SHOCK ME SURPRISED, how can this happen on a...**PVP SERVER**?
---
You can get Luna unit frames addon and right click on the enemy port and add battle tag!
---
Best advice is in my opinion to just save money while playing the game normally. Just dont buy too many items from AH (just buying weapons/wands is the best) and dont buy skills that dont help much.
---
What is there to "fix" though?
---
A guy I knew in vanilla had atiesh. He was the only one on the server I think. As far as I know he stopped playing early BC. Back then I never got his name, Beatrixkiddo - I always assumed the 'kiddo' part was like a version of kid. Years later, when I was old enough to watch Kill Bill I was like... "Oh..."
---
&gt; Actually I rarely die in ganks because most horde are smart enough to not fight a paladin. It's a waste if time lol. Its up because no one engages me lol
---
lmao nice joke
---
Well that depends. Do you need gold now or in 6 months +-? Gold is worth more now than later due to inflation.
---
Yeah that
---
Yes?  Your point?
---
Specifically, UD Shadow Priest, because of DP for 1v1 and duels. Right?
---
There is a website called petopia which has information where to learn different levels of pet abilities.
---
Ah. I haven't played since bc and it shows.
---
No, tanking as fury is viable and in fact often straight up better.
---
The fuck? Does that hold up in court when you know your father is stealing money from people and do nothing about it?
---
At least think before you write such nonsense. Father or not he's a fucking thief.
---
Nonetheless it‘s a bummer. I planned to hit 60 in November and now I‘m thinking about rerolling on the big pvp server.
---
&gt; It’s trolling the person ganking you. Especially once honor drops, and you are disallowing kill credit to your attackers.
---
But, how? the paladin will go to their hearthstone location, which could be a very long way, then has to come back or do something else? Meanwhile? Me i know he used hs and i know he was a coward and ran. I will stay in the spot i just earned and if the paladin wants to die he can come back but usually they just go farm on other spots. How is this "trolling" when the paladins gets kicked out of the spot and never comes back or he dies?
---
If he hearths, /who and try to find him again
---
Yup, same name that bought it has it listed for 122g in the bottom screenshot.

Strat live means the living side of strath, as opposed to the undead side. It kind of splits off in two directions and one side you kill scarlet humans and the other side you kill undead.

Spotted the ignoramus.

All these crazy suggestions of "just practice" then ignoring the one player that is forced to pay attention to everything he is struggling to focus on.

Healing. Play a healer. If you don't want to level one all the way make a healer Twink when bgs come out. Don't even fully Twink just get a couple easier to get items pvp a bit then level to the next bracket when you feel comfortable with the pacce of the game. 19 can be overly gimmicky so skipping that isn't bad.
---
Healing forces you to pay attention to health. It forces you to pay attention to cooldowns. It forces you to pay attention to debuffs. In bgs you also will be able to observe how other players play from a distance, when they are popping cooldowns and what options that opens up for them. How those cooldowns translate into damage and cc.
---
Healing in bgs forces you to herd cats while limiting your exposure to the enemy. This helps improve your vision as a whole.
---
Everything you are struggling to pay attention to, are the things good pvp healers have to pay attention to.
---
Someone else did the math. You need around 250 dps for Vael, which is trivial.

Should've used Papyrus to make it more thematically close

I thought the long wind-up for Classic launch was because they were making it viable for current hardware :/
---
Not rly no,  me and another shammy is ele/resto and we are pretty even on healing and dont have mana problems. It will work fine until bwl comes
---
if you want to maximize your DPS you will always need those consumes as a paladin regardless of how you build your gear. MCP is also not that hard to farm and this build relies pretty heavily on it. If you refuse to use MCP you should pretty much get the fastest weapon you can get. brain hacker is pretty good entry level weapon for the build.

I'm currently a level 54 BM hunter and was wondering at what point should I go ahead and respec for MM, since its optimal for endgame. Would it be worth it to go ahead and respec now considering most of my time now is spent running dungeons for my pre raid BiS items rather than solo questing?
---
Literally every information he has about the game is just one wowhead search away. Even before he became bigger. And you could see that at least 3-5 months before classic even released.. Just because he makes the effort and spells out entire wowhead articles or guides that have existed for years for his own "new" videos doesn't make him a good player. The only good thing that came from him were the class interviews with known private server players to get a bit more in-depth about some stuff you normally don't find without knowing what to search for. I didn't know frontstabbing was a thing because i didn't play private servers.. but oh well, it doesn't work in classic anyways. But yeah, other than that he just seems like he wants to have a hand in everything that has to do with classic and he is using connections he build up til now to meddle with everything going on. The way he leads the raid is a joke. Kicking people for a debuff that is negligible. Weak. If he is not seeing the irony in bashing Method for being tryhards (which they are not, they are whats called "organized", he might have to look that one up) he is a lost cause.

Why, is he unkillable?

I love this advice I constantly see. “I’d wait 6 months.”
---
We use it to great success.  We laugh and chill in our 60 MC/Ony raids.  Tips, is a fucking tool, and that's why his raids are garbage.
---
A true bummer. Do you think it‘s worth rerolling on a pvp sever? I‘m not particularly good at pvp and enjoy dungeons and raids the most, but with being on a pve server I feel restricted in a weird way.
---
Wouldn't spend the time or money to farm it and edgemasters then to be honest. If you do happen to get one and snag up a cheap edgemasters, go ahead, but the package is very pricey and the upside is a bunch more threat than Eskhanders, that's it really.
---
The procc is pretty negligible, even with high uptime.

Yep u know legal things could still be scummy right?

Crashing the US economy was legal, still think it was scummy.

Once in STV I was running by in my travel form when I saw lvl 35 forsaken rogue fighting our warlock I immedeatly joined, we killed the rogue, but only then I noticed warlock was lvl 44 xD.

Strat live is the Scarlet side where you go in the main entrance and the main boss is Balnazzar.  Strat UD (undead) is the side where you go in the back entrance and the main boss is Baron Rivendale. Technically Strat is one big instance but most groups choose to do one side per run.
---
These things take time, those videos usually talk about prices in an established economy.  Early phases the best (guaranteed) gold to make is from things that don’t depend on the auction house like vendoring items from a mob that has a decent loot table, or killing humanoids for cloth 
---
And it’s only a matter of time before a hunter/mage gold tycoon owns the AH when he comes up and buys out all the items and raises the prices by like double or triple
---
Since when does /anything/ counter a Mage in PvP? A Mage could randomly slap his dick on the keyboard and still CC someone endlessly.

Drowning people with mc is absolutely fantastic
---
hillsbrad is pretty tense too, since the two towns are fairly close together as they go, and the quests overlap areas in high demand. Hillbrad sort of forces competition for resources, just like STV
---
Reminds me of the old 40 paladin vs 40 shaman video.
---
https://youtu.be/ZDZzrikYqTM
---
Nice.  Reminds me of my first time in STV back in true vanilla.  This higher level was trying to gank me (druid) so I took refuge in the ocean.  He followed me all they way to the bottom where I let him chase me for a while.  Then I just entangled him down there over and over til.he drowned.  It was epic.
---
So, forgive me to taking the OP's post on a slight tangent, but I heard that the proc from Eskhander Claw doesn't stack with Flurry from the fury tree. Can anyone confirm/deny this?
---
select reduce input lag option. get bartender4 and select enable cast on key press instead of release.
---
See that's the difference for horde players. They will join in and help to specifically kill this one alliance scum out of 6 just in spite.
---
I am the guy who manages the raids in our guild.
---

---
Monolith dkp is okay for the dkp part. Works fine for ingame addon.
---
Guild roster management is great for keep track what is happening in guild and let you know whom alt insert_alt_character is.
---
For the raid signups I use google spreadsheet and guildies are filling a same survey for every raid. I just delete answers after each raid. Officers have own class pages on signup spreadsheet where they can keep track who are benched so I can add bench dkp to them after raid. I also have name class and role parts copied to another spreadsheet and that is public for raiders so they can check their own signup status. 
---
Questions I have in the survey are: ingame name, class, role, attunements: mc and ony, got required potions (gfpp and restoration potion) x5, are they able to join in time and "other extra information" - like: "have to leave at 22:00"
---
I also have name class and role parts copied to another spreadsheet what is public for raiders. Officers have own class pages on signup spreadsheet where they can keep track who are benched so I can add bench dkp to them after raid.
---
Have to say spreadsheet works well. We have a spots already shared for the raid and class officers invite only the players they are allowed. Like for 9 mages - mage officer can fill only 6 spots. Warlock officer can invite 5 locks from 7 etc.
---
You might have trouble farming it as a paladin.
---
In wow I generally play female characters because I just hate the way males look. (Exception is my male tauren because he is cute).
---
In most every other game I prefer to play a male character. FFxiv or in RPG games like Dragon Age, AC:Odyssey, par exemple.
---
I lost it at "How do you do fellow melee DPS"
---
people like you, disgust me
---
Yes
---
Incoming virgins telling you how your ui is bad....
---
Oh thats too bad. Feeling sorry for ya!
---
i tanked TBC as a palading before and after the gearing changes. it was fun on both ends!
---
To us it made sense for it to go to our PvP Leader.  
---
Raikiri organises PvP events for both the guild and the realm on the Alliance-side.   
---
In my eyes it makes the most sense for it to go to someone who will make the most use of it, as PvE-oriented Warriors and Paladins have better alternatives down the line.
---
Not exactly accurate.
---
A guild needs maybe 4 tanks total until later raids.  One MT and a few OTs.  After that you’re going to be smothered by dozens of other fury warriors.  You’re going to have just as much loot competition as a Mage.
---
I actually been to apologise tel, I don't mean to reply to you but to the op. There's nothing wrong with your answer is that there are more things you can bring
---
Send in a hunter pet instead of a mage if you have trouble losing your mages :).
---
How about a Tauren sitting in it like a hot tub.
---
I just had a stroke reading your reply
---
Gold content!
---
Paladins are the best pvp healers. Their kit is amazing for a support role. Playing ret in pvp is a complete waste.
---
I get what you're saying and I somewhat agree. He did have a point with the whole blacklist thing considering the general hostility towards streamers in the beta and before launch. Effectively streamers dont really get harrassed too much though which is surprising to me
---
Is this spell batching? It's like this for execute for me
---
The thing i hate most is people showing off before raid like what op is talking about, getting into raid and being shit and making up excuses..”ah it’s a bad day at work” “I’m tired” etcetc.. just stfu and say sorry when you fucked up and don’t act like you know shit
---
I think that’s what op is getting at
---
Yes, we all know that Molten Core and Onyxia are easy as hell. And BWL likely won't present a huge challenge, but it will be a bit tougher than MC. But once people get towards the end of AQ40, and especially Naxx, you bet min-maxing will be important. Sure, if that's not really a concern of yours, then by all means, bring all the shadow priests you want.
---
The big issue is not their damage. You can compensate for that easily. The problem is the number of debuff slots they need to even do their mediocre damage.
---
Riight.
---
just get the census add on and youll know which guild can field 1 or more raid
---
Yeah I would be pretty bummed if one person in my class got four pieces lmao
---
After reading the comments, I just came here to brag, that I got mine about a week ago for less than 180g, and I'm happily wearing it.
---
With the Onyxia wipe animation there is no proof that the raid leader in question was bad at the game himself or that he was a hypocrite. The raid lead didn't exactly end up in the whelp cave or anything. I think most people like it anyhow just because mad guy yells at videogames anyway.
---
Tips IS a hypocrite and toxic without the right to even be toxic. Claiming stuff like "classic is super chill" while still acting like this is laughable.
---
I rly hope some day they release it. Maybe during 30 years of warcraft or something
---
also, if you watch closely, most of the "prot warriors" here also have a superior ilvl and it help quite a bit
---
[Some of us are actually telling the truth](https://imgur.com/2jR0y4r)
---
Most people in here need to just chill the hell out and accept the fscedthat vanilla is easy mode. We’re not here for the difficulty, we’re here for the nostalgia. And if you want a real challenge wait for honor and bgs. Maybe max/AQ
---
Switching mains and from horde to alliance so 100 percent starting over. I can't decide between druid or paladin. I want to heal pvp and pve semi casually without respeccing. I love flavor spells and utility out of combat. Fun stuff. I like buffing and playing support over healer. Not a fan of tanking.
---
I've heard rumors that shadow was initially intended to be a priest tank spec, but that the idea was scrapped before WoW was released, and that mind blast is a relic of that idea.
---
Someone is in for a bad surprise. Should we tell him?
---
Nice man!
---
Is this really true? Feels like many more are 60. Maybe it’s just my server. I wish blizzard would release stats on this stuff
---
It's definitely also due to getting PTSD because you keep on getting murdered in the jungle out of fucking nowhere.
---
that’s for full runs. Just doing the arena part is lvl 50-51 mobs, which is at the start of BRD, so anyone level 50+ is good to go pretty much. I started tanking arena runs at 51.
---
Thing is, you can do this while just chilling. You just hotkey fishing, put your mouse on the bobber, and just click when you hear it. Then you can watch something like Netflix/sports/Twitch/Youtube on your second monitor, and you'll still be earning money ingame.
---
Welllll, way to go off track. I was thinking some sort of sandwich
---
Or they are posting "pst for price!"
---
You send tell asking the price.
---
"Offer?"
---
I wanna go LW in my hunter because being a trapper/skinner just makes sense to me. But I feel like it would be more beneficial to to engi just for QOL stuff
---
He could have had 2,5 lvl 60. That means very shortly he would have got 3 lvl 60s. That would actually be rather good for the time classic is out.
---
You get them from Iron Bound Chests and Mithril Bound Chests, which you can get from just fishing and also from Floating Wreckage nodes.
---
I’m a new player to WoW and I find it funny how people are propping up nax whenever I look around in threads. Am really excited to see if it lives up to it.
---
People were saying the same shit about MC and look how easy it is. My guild with a ton of new players just 1 shotting every boss.
---
It’s really not needed
---
&gt;Pertento is a sellout guild, they hand out loot based on Patreon subscriptions...
---
This seems like a really salty comment, especially since it infers a breach of the game's T&amp;C. Do you have any proof? If not, I'm going to guess I need to ask you over whenever I get fish and chips.
---
What I did yesterday was selling all the stuff from the alts even the equip, send them to my main and deleted them. Cold turkey
---
lol towelie is not down to earth or good

MY BAWLS
---
herb skin is probably the strongest combo in a vacuum IMO.
---
But it can depend based on what you actually plan to grind a lot during your endgame.
---
Devilsaurs? Then skinning mining. DM:E? then Herb Mining. Etc.
---
if you dont know for sure I'd probably stick to herb skinning.

Had a blast (pun not intended) leveling as a fire mage up to 55, loved the high crits and varied rotation, keeping up scorch and seeing the crazy ignite burns, also thanks to the talent Impact you get some decent CC that helps you both while killing mobs and to some degree in pvp. When i did dungeons people always complained that i wasn't able to do the new meta AOE xp farm thingy but fuck those guys, i could play how i liked.  
---
Switched to frost in preparation for raiding and it's seriously just spamming frostbolt...
---
Its a girl 100%
---
Freshrope.
---
Grob is actually almost a 50/50 split. So yeah, pvp wise it is a good choice.
---
I just rolled my eyes so hard they almost fell out of my head.
---
There was someone in Trade a couple weeks ago selling enchants or something and someone called her "dude" and she FLIPPED out about how she was a woman, thank you very much, and how dare someone call her dude, etc.
---
She got trolled pretty hard after that for being ridiculous and it was pretty satisfying.
---
Basilisks on the shore south of grom gol. Lvl 39
---
Grats, but boy, what a boring life to live.... As a fellow Mage, I find AOE grinding drull &amp; maddening. I may have rolled the wrong class, because now my Mage is just a 1 day a week raiding too.
---
Undead &amp; Demons only i believe
---
Speaking of Madseason, does anyone have that clip where he jokes around with the inflexion in people's voices when they talk about the game, like in Make Love Not Warcraft? It's absolute solid gold, but I can't find it anywhere.
---
Paladins are garbage, do Druid
---
Arcane pots specifically alleviate an annoying and dangerous boss mechanic for no effort during the fight.  Same with the fire protection except on a lot more fights. Sure you can tough it out with a health pool 3k with +damage gear and pray you get healed in between two attacks or mitigate that risk that by hitting one button before the fight starts. 
---
Of course any one person could be naked and afk and odds are the raid would be fine. Doesn't mean you shouldn't make things clean and risk free for a small preparatory effort
---
Friend of mine for banned for 30 days BC he did a copper route for about 2-3 hours
---
He's right you know...
---
Lol me too
---
That's just how it's done. It was the same in Vanilla. Crafting it as an individual is such a daunting task, it would take months, if not longer. 
---
Guilds probably started saving for this purpose from week 1. I know mine did.
---
You’ll have just as much competition with warrior as mage, sure, but as mage the most depth to your gameplay is finding the best place to position yourself so you can mash your frostbolt keybind without interruption
---
So first, I will definitely take shadow priests into 5-mans, especially if my healer isn't a priest. 
---
However, 2nd, unless there's something I'm not aware of, Shadow Word: Pain is tied with Corruption for damage. Now, I believe Spriests have more boosts to damage than warlocks (15% from Shadowform, 10% from Darkness, vs warlocks only get 15% from Demonic Sacrifice) so I suppose that would make it more powerful, though there may be factors related to Corruption having a base cast time potentially effecting its spell power coefficient that I simply don't know enough about.
---
Anyways, my point is that while it may be a powerful dot, maybe even the most powerful, it's not THAT much better than a dot from another class that would deal more damage than a spriest. On top of that, there aren't that many debuff slots on a boss that are available, which is honestly the main issue, not the damage.
---
I like Fei with the "Fuck it, Imma frost shock him" resto shaman damage.
---
I have 4 characters in the 36-50 bracket.  Just get bored with em

I don't hate as much as

Where are all your  spells D:
---
ya this guy is talking like MC and ony are hard? and if you take more than 1 shadow priest you are fucked. LOL
---
I have killed rag on pugs with multiple corruptions and serpent stings up. An organized guild, especially one that has been clearing MC for a 1.5 months can take whatever classes they want.
---
Warrior is a strong pvp class in BG’s. If by babysitting you mean a 10v10 environment then sure? 
---
Nobody is out here arguing that warriors are god tier 1v1’s, if anything people seem to think 5 of the matchups are auto losses (which tbf they are most of the time). If anyone is out here saying they’re strong 1v1 in vanilla you’re wrong.
---
We had to think of something creative, considering Alliance only has budget Shamans in the form of Paladins. ;)
---
I'm in the exact same situation, lol.
---
12 fps, 190 ms, wrong spec, no BiS gear, messy UI, small screen etc. Just remember this when you play Classic in 2019.

I am the worst performing fury in this raid and I would beat everyone in their raid. Our tank (who happens to be on the list posted by OP) would be #9 dps in their raid.

Ret sucks. Esfand sucks. His guild sucks.

I will never understand the hate for this font. Who TF cares? I can read it, it's cool with me.

Fuck wingdings though.

You're an absolute idiot, or you can't parse a simple paragraph if you think I'm "upset". Keep up that victim complex tho. The only ones I see upset here are the alliance babies constantly surprised pvp happens on a pvp server. Lol
---
It's like 10,000 spoons and all you need is a knife
---
I don't think there's anything mindless about aoe mage grinding so if you can't do open world mobs grinding with a beast master Hunter then I don't know. The farming methods for warlocks are solo princess or just chain drain tank mobs to death in the open world.

If I have to bet, thay wanted another flying vehicle which is the dwarf plane, but was cut durring production.

If you have Questie go to your map (press M) and then hit the Zoom Out button at the top of the map.  This will show you the entire continent and what quests are available where.
---
You can then also use the drop down at the top of the map to check the other continent also.
---
Facts
---
No, the streamer is better at pressing nothing else but Frostbolt the entire fight than you.
---
No, this person is a luckier version of you, as he also got the wand. Pay attention to OPs post, please!!
---
Phase 5 they go fire at least
---
I ran a mythic raiding guild in legion and 7 out of the 20 were girls. Plus everyone is much older. It’s really hearing a late 20 year old woman playing the “i’m a girl who plays games.” Card like she is trying to be the cool girl in a highschool circle of dudes.
---
Isn't 8.3 coming out soon? Go do some Warfronts to prepare for that.
---
On your last point (about playing what gives the awesome-factor); they don't perform well in the content I want to play, and just generally have stigma surrounding them. Add to that, that I'm quite competitive too...
---
Using your 7 point system:
---
1. Levelling: I'd rather not have to drink/eat when not in a dungeon or raid (though world rares are fine too, for food buffs mostly). I don't mind downtime itself, I just don't like shelling out coin when I do it. 
---
2. End Game PvE/Raiding: This is a problematic one for me. Actually in the Raid/dungeon, I don't mind being a healer or DPS itself. But I have no interest in respecs or having multiple sets of gear. I just don't like being a healer when I'm outside of a raid or dungeon. 
---
3. Battlegrounds: I have no intent to do premade BGs, so this one comes down to personal performance; I have no interest in healing here. I want to player-kill. Not player-heal so another player can player-kill. 
---
4. World PvP: I want to be able to kill in 1v1 at least. I'm not fussed if I get grouped against. Also don't want it to be a slow attrition thing either. I don't want to be bad here, or rely on running away.
---
5. Farming Potential: This is one I've never really considered much, myself. Though sooner or later, I'll have Engineering, which limits the gathering side of things in terms of farming. 
---
6. Enjoyment: This is a big one for me; I don't want to touch Tanking at all, and don't like having 'chores' be part of my Class/spec. Such as Arrows, Soul Shards or Crowd Pummelers. A big part of my enjoyment will come from specific builds of the class, not the class itself -- I've always been spec-driven, not class-driven. Which has been the main thing that deters me from Mage at least; I don't want to change specs. 
---
7.  Availability: This is a weird one for me. In sheer hours, I have a good amount available. The thing is though, never on the evenings of Tuesday, Wednesday or Saturday (not counting any possible overtime either). Which really gets in the way of raiding potential, so maybe I'd be better with rolling a spec that doesn't need great gear to be great.
---
I've made many alts, even of the same class. Once I've left a character, I can't bring myself to return to it. So going with a 'do X on this character, and do Y on this other character' is not an option for me. The highest level I've reached is 17 (a couple times). 
---
I've still made no progress (even though it's almost a month since I made the post your replied to)! Because after that 7 point system, I still got dealbreakers. No Alliance (feels too weird), no Tauren (or Troll to a lesser degree, as well as Undead in robes). Don't like pets, especially Hunter ones.  Extra chores due to class/spec. Even OOM issues are a problem; I tried Ele DPS in RFC, and absolutely hated it, for example. 
---
After everything I've researched, and tried to low levels, I think this is all I've got left to consider:
---
* Shadow Priest: Love the mind-focus of the spec, Mind Control seems awesome, love the Shadow spells, and Vampiric Embrace seems super nice too. Issues are the stigma, OOM, finding a raid spot, gearing (potentially 3 sets; main dps set, heal set for dungeons, and MP5 set for raids). Also the issue of Undead in robes or just being a Troll. 
---
* Feral Cat: Love that it's fast, almost no downtime, powershifting seems fun. I like the faster Stealth and general options available. Plus it can apparently tank dungeons in its DPS gear and has a easier time with aggro. Issues are the stigma, Pummeler farming, playing a Tauren, finding a Raid spot. I don't care for cats aesthetically.  Needs very specific pieces of gear to pull mediocre numbers. Plus is more attrition-based for PvP. No cat form until 20 though. 
---
There are some others I've tried before, such as Resto/Ele healing Hybrid, that also have their own issues too of course.
---
WTS pitchforks, cheaper than AH!
---
The fact that he was a small "nobody" when pservers was his thing, and is now a big "somebody" actually annoys me more than it should. Just because he is still the same turd he was back then, too bad relevancy splashed over on him, unfortunately.
---
Aw, you even had a hunter buffing a priest, mage, warlock and a druid with trueshot aura!
---
Many of the diamond "tiles" on the floor of Ironforge are stretched out as well.
---
Quality content my dude!
---
Who got the eye though?!
---
Shut up virgin, his UI is fine
---
Not to mention the almost criminal lack of consumables of any type.  Not even a food buff.
---
yes, to be specific it'sabout 16.6k XP earned for around 12 min at level 50.
---
People are differenciating because they are very different things. If you join an dm tribute run but need loot from the guards you are not getting anything you are in the wrong group. If you need balnazar and join a strath ud run you are practically in the wrong instance. It's just so people know what they are signing up for. It's not that people somehow feel like using this terms, it is absolutely necessary. If you have played as much as you claimed  you should be very much have no problem to understand this. Also there are not that many variations to begin with in the game, it's not complicated

After I got 5/5 precision and 2/2 endurance in Combat, I spent 5 in Master of Deception and 5 in Camoflauge out of the Subtlety tree.  Then I went back to fill out Combat.  Finished with some in Assassination.  I got Blade Fury at like 38?  And Adrenaline Rush aroind 47 I think.  Little late but I loved having the improved stealth talents.  It helped in the late 30s to farm SM for my mount.
---
There is also a Subtlety Hemo leveling spec for a pvp server that you can level easily enough with.  I don't have a link for it.  
---
Just log in and stab shit to 60.  It's a lot of fun.  Good Luck!

Just find him on twitch and watch his raiding vods :)

I like Wolves the most, I gotta say! Weird run animation though. Looks weird. :)
---
Points to consider:
---
* The honor system is gonna be out soon, while we'll still be waiting for battlegrounds for months. Some people think this will make the leveling experience on PvP servers awful, because people will be ganking for honor.
---
* Once battlegrounds do come out, you can participate in those to get your PvP kick.

Nice ! But the main gold is made with the charms they loot ( it is needed for warrior lvl 30 axe ), so you actually made all your profit with rare bonus loot lol
---
I think there are a lot of people who just never mature past highschool age. That, and a lack of meaningful relationships or attention in real life culminates into that level of ultimate "gurlgamer" cringe.

Kurrinax we stomp horde, buts its close to 50 50

My thoughts on the extra threat is that the intended use is to snipe killing blows to proc spirit tap. They wanted to discourage its use mid-rotation so it can be up at the end of a fight.

I bet you picked that name just so you could make this post.

More like 2 deftanks and 5-8 furys. Competition is insane. Rogues, Warriors and even Hunters all want the same stuff.

I'm glad to see he branched out, a life of crime just didn't suit him.
---
Came here to post this. I have only one rule with alts which is that I cannot log into any other character until my first is level 60, no matter how bad it gets. After that, my actual "endgame" will be leveling up one of every other Alliance class.
---
It sounds crazy on paper, but I'm just going to play each alt one day a week until the rested bonus is gone, then set it aside until the next week. Day or two off or playing my main on the weekend and each alt should always have at least one full bar of rested when I play it.
---
It will take a lot of calendar time, but the /played per character should be pretty good when they all get to 60. And then I'll have seven new 60s all at once.
---
Wait, what’s wrong with the UI?
---
You forgot about the font for your action bars. Look how the "N" on the hunters mark macro is different from the "N" in the "LF TANk post in lfg.
---
Your job isn't done here, satan.
---
Not lagging. This is intended due to #NoChanges. They've made Spell-batching slower so it behaves more like it does in Vanilla. Likewise how hitboxes are bigger when moving. :)

What is the surprise? I allready know of course, but my friend here doesn't.

Ooooof

After this video came out, it at least is a meme within the other big streamers (like Ven etc) you can hear him and others in the raid jokingly say "clear coms, clear coms" when shit is going down.

I leveled to 45 using a boar because it eats everything and is moderately tanky. Now I use a wind serpent for higher dps.
---
Onyxia bags (18): free or guild bank bid
---
16 slot bags: 20-30g
---
18 slot bags: 200-400g
---
Of course I'd want an 18 slot bag, but 2 bag slots aren't worth that much gold. I'll just use the mail return trick.
---
Doing fun stuff Def is more druid territory
---
This... I have a boar and like never have to buy food for it cause it eats  everything that drops! Saves so much bag space
---
While this is mostly true, there were a few fights were a Paladin actually would have superior mitigation to a Warrior. First, aoe situations, but that's a given, but any boss that attacked faster than normal (Illidan and Brutallus jump to mind, but there might be others) because a warrior's 2 shield block charges would get eaten up, leaving him vulnerable to crushing blows, while a paladin's Holy Shield had 7 charges, so they would remain uncrushable. The downside to this was that since Holy Shield only gave 30% block, it was a lot harder for a paladin to hit 102.4% than a warrior, but once they did, their mitigation was almost the same (warrior did still have a small edge).
---
There are ways to make more than 10 gold an hour and netflix simultaneously though.

Never apologize

You'll never be able to transfer from a PvE server to a PvP server but the opposite can be true

I got a buddy rolling a Priest on my server. What should I mail to him as a "starter pack" of sorts?
---
So far I've got 10g, a level 5 wand, and four Runecloth Bags. 
---
Are there any tricks or things I can buy to significantly speed up the Priest leveling process? E.g. putting Fiery enchant on a white sword for Rogues.
---
i wonder if she asked for the manager
---
Bleaumaux is one of the most balanced servers I believe.
---
Does Flask of Supreme Power increase healing done? I"m thinking no, as the tooltip says spell damage, but I don't want to blow the 80g to test it.

Would have rather seen the full fight personally.

Depends on race female orcs, trolls and tauren all look better in gear than their male counterparts imo. Maybe you play Ally but horde females tend to fit gear better. Undead clip through everything though regardless of gender

Even with tremor totem, our raid just didn't have enough fear wards to keep me completely immune to the aoe fear. Eventually I tanked it (3rd kill), but not our progression kill. Everything else from SSC/TK through to our Felmyst kill (furthest I got) I main tanked for our progression kill.
---
For years I pretended not to have a mic for this reason
---
You guys downvoting me for liking Post Malone or for saying he's a e-celeb? He got famous through youtube guys...
---
I also got a Staff of Jordan from a random wolf in Badlands during Vanilla. Maybe it has slightly increased drop rate there?
---
This is classicwow, mister. All the furries are still playing druids.
---
Was this kromcrush??? Just asking cuz that’s how it looks like everyday
---
Compared to other gold making methods in the game fishing is among the absolute worst, on any server with a normal economy anyway. Might be some exceptions if for whatever reason fire snappers / stonescale eel sells for something, havent been the case on my server anyway.
---

---
You'll want new ranks of Bite and Charge as you level.
---
The content never requires min max because vanilla is piss easy by modern standards. But we are gonna do it anyway so please stfu
---
Can't you just drink a Giants strength elixir or something similar?
---
Woops
---
Get him a rare qualify wand for mid 20s lvl. Dps boost is noticable to the priest and lasts longer than green upgrade.
---
Yeah no. People consistently do 500dps already. Warriors with activated recklessness pull 1k dps. Fights are very short in MC. We had to have our MT go furyprot because it grew impossible to hold all this threat. All the snakehuman fights in MC take less than one minute, with the exception of Majordomo. Shazzrah is a 30sec fight for example.
---
Given how easy it is to level a Hunter, you should have leveled a Warrior first. You’re in for a treat man.
---
But on topic yeah, you might want to use your Hunter as your gold farming/fun character and level something more raid worthy for late game. You may not even get tier three on your Hunter anyway since the tokens are shared with two other classes that take priority over Hunters in raids.
---
I respec every week. Arcane/frost raid spec is ass for anything nonraid. To be clear though, it's not even necessary for MC at all. I do it because I'm the ranged officer and setting an example.
---
On the plus side, 100g a week is easily recouped with 2-3 hours aoe farming.
---
Well I obviously don't know faction ratio, but there is always back and forth pvp action in the usual places (e.g. stv, hillsbrad, blackrock mountain). A full raid of allies locked down thorium point - blackrock the other day.
---
Well yeah, creating your own bot to fish with is extremely easy. Set water quality to Low. PixalSearch the screen for the color of the bobber/feathers and move the mouse over it. Then, scan a small section around the mouse for the splash (off-white color) and right click when detected.
---
Once you get that dialed in, you can expend it:
---
Randomize all sleeps and movements to throw off detection
---
Get system time at start of the script, check current time against it, if 5 minutes elapse reapply bobber
---
Detect if you’re dead and close game and exit script
---
Scan the minimap for other players (tracking on a hunter) and turn on AFK and sit down until they pass 
---
Scan for a whisper from Blizzard, immediately stop fishing, minimize the game and send an alert to my call phone via a text from google voice #. I can then respond to text which circles back to the game and types it to the person whispering me
---
Get him the greater magic wand too
---
I don't this is any close to hygienic in any situation, including real life
---
I kept thick hide out of habit from flag carrying, if you're really good at hit and run, I could see dropping it for sure.
---
Holy hell people, I come across a comment that is, at the time, *3 hours old* and has 0 upvotes, and note that it’s underrated and not upvoted *at that time*, and y’all get salty at me for the usual reddit comment of “criminally underrated” because, at that time, it was? And I get downvoted into oblivion? That’s some bullshit right there.
---
Whatever you do, don't bob for apples at the Goldshire inn...
---
Boiled beef? What a cockney thing to do.
---
Curse has at least one person who researches addons for things like this, and you can contact them to report issues with addons.
---
No where in that list does it differentiate between horde and alliance. Horde get the trinket from Hinterlands elite quests and yet a bunch of braindead horde were taking it because "it's on my bis list". Alliance pissing other people off is just typical though.
---
Less optimal frost spells for sure.
---
Exactly. And anyone who played vanilla knows how big of a problem it was. Just content whispers and unsolicited trade windows.
---
So how much (real money) did you pay for that? First MC clear 2 months in and they passed you the 👁 
---
Very hard to believe 😂...
---
Except that way the auction house gets its cut twice, once for the mats and once for the item, reducing possible profit margins considerably.
---
ditto... HOW DARE YOU PVP ME ON A PVP SERVER I PICKED TO PLAY ON! like really? if you want to pick and choose your fights... pve and then battlegrounds in phase 2.
---
&gt; though I never really tell people that I cleared naxx and shit.
---
I'll wave my Retail Realm First Zen Fishing achievement around before any raid achievement.  Getting that required over an hour of absolute and unbroken concentration as a single missed cast would have been enough to lose it.  There were others standing next to me that hit 600 literally seconds after I managed it.
---
If that's not a test of concentration, I don't know what is.
---
is orc is strong
---
Because ret paladin is the lowest dps in the game, atm you’re beating randoms during levelling which doesn’t mean much.
---
In an actual raid with dps playing correctly ret is bottom and it’s the reason Paladins tend to be forced to holy.
---
Maybe boots enchanted with Minor Speed?  I think any class would like those
---
Takes one to know one.
---
We have a boomie in our guild... dude has staff of dominance and choker of the fire lord (other great epics as well) and although his Dps is hideous dudes fun to bring in pvp
---
Others explained the PPM math, but the damage of SOC is simple; it is always 70% of normal weapon damage regardless of rank. Slower hitting weapons generally have a higher damage range at the same item level, so SOC will hit harder with them. It doesn't scale based on weapon speed, but the weapon damage is adjusted to be higher for slower weapons, so it does "scale" based on that.
---
Righteousness is different because its base damage is scaled based on weapon speed so it procs on every hit, but it maths out to the same damage output regardless of speed. So you will get the same damage with any weapon, and you can't increase or decrease the base proc damage. There is also a component of the damage that scales a little bit with spell power, but the coefficient is low, and it's also fixed based on whatever your spell power happens to be.
---
With a 3.50 speed two-handed weapon I've swapped between Seal of Command and Seal of Righteousness back and forth over a couple hours of grinding single target mobs and, overall, on average, SOC will be noticeably faster for killing things.
---
With that slow hard-hitting weapon I'll most of the time have to refresh Righteousness before the mob dies and it may take another 10 seconds to kill it. With SOC the thing will usually die without having to refresh, or one white hit after it expires, but once in a while I'll refresh and it takes 5 more seconds, and rarely it won't proc a single time in 30 seconds and I may have to refresh it twice. So it can be very uneven because of the RNG, but when it hits it hits very hard, which on average makes it better (again, with a slow enough weapon speed, so that the height of yellow damage peaks will offset RNG no-proc valleys).
---
If you have a 3.40 or faster weapon, just use Seal of Righteousness because then it will do better overall. The combination of lower chance to proc and lower weapon damage will cause SOC to fall behind vs. the steady modest damage of Righteousness on these faster weapons. Also if you're judging Wisdom or Light, a faster weapon with Righteousness may be a better option anyway if you want to proc more mana or health return.
---
If you have a slow enough two-hander and you're not judging on CD, then SOC also has the advantage that it can be a little more mana efficient since you always can use Rank 1 (55 mana) and get exactly the same proc damage, where with Righteousness you need to use higher ranks for the best proc damage.
---
Little late to the party.. would it be useful to have one that toggles between pet attack and pet follow?
---
I get 100 fps at 4k with medium-high graphics quality while also driving a second 4k display with a GTX 1050ti.
---
There's something really endearing about the old ratio that spread the action bar to both sides
---
I got the same problem with ferocious bite. Since it drains all energy on use, if I use it just before an energy tick (displayed by addon) I should have 20 energy. However I have to cast it almost a second before the tick or it will drain the energy of the incoming tick too.
---
Oh, a 6%edge. That's a *real* dominating position . . .
---
The gnome smiling in every bucket says otherwise. &gt;.&lt;

(cool picture)
---
It was drop runs, and we just brought and extra for mage water quest :P

It fits the aesthetic of wow perfectly

I swear it intentionally unfocuses your vision, everything seems purposefully misaligned.
---
These wounds are coloured teal.
---
Amazing!
---
You can only do 5 runs your first hour. As the instance limit only starts ticking once you leave. So going at 12 minutes will hit the limit.  Can look for more stuff to farm
---
Probably just a furry.
---
How are your professions? In the 30’s I did a lot of gathering while looking for SM GY or lib groups till I was 35 then CATH. Just set your hearth to undercity if you plan to do that.
---
Warriors fighting with rogues, hunters and ferals for their gear is rough too.
---
FFA+DKP haha
---
Even for guildies that’s 1000g!!
---
Since you can’t have multiple hots in classic you need to coordinate with other healers. You’re assigned to certain tanks/groups or it’s just a grab for who can cast it first or has more +healing.
---
Poor letterfit/kerning (inconsistent space between characters), and inconsistent unmodulated strokes (the width of the font lines) make it look like a middle school student wrote it.
---
I think the main reason people hate it so much - myself included - is that it was one of the small subset of fonts included in like... Windows 98, and back then people misused it EVERYWHERE!
---
I think the way you did it is perfect. Had you done what you planned initially the storytelling of the image would have changed, as if the main character wanted to avoid bobbing for apples not because of his lack of a lower jaw with a rotting tongue hanging out, but rather because someone in the background was contaminating it.
---
has crendor been streaming classic ? not seen him for ages
---
The bloodvine set is a vest iirc
---
Right click it so there's no short yellow rotating lines around the border. Should be possible to disable it.
---
They make $22 a month on paetron. I can't imagine anyone is buying anything with that little.
---
My guild always follows 3 sunders till it vacate a meme in chat. Just keep repeating to everyone that it’s not a dps race, most of the wipes are always from asspulls or threat going on to someone who isn’t supposed to have it.
---
You know it's funny because I met members of my now guild and thought they were alliance at first because my party member said "there are alliance up here" but it turns out they were just all eating deviate fish and changed them to human. I left his group joined theirs and am now doing MC with them
---
WotlK had no playable goblin hunters.
---
Not a good option for leveling priests
---
Herbalism and alchemy, my alt does ... sewing? Tailoring? And enchanting
---
He must not play on a PVP server.
---
Ouch, took me one solo kill. Dogs are awful farm for priest so I'm glad it didn't take longer.
---
Boars are best pets. Charge is great, and they'll eat anything you have lying around.
---
Many as you can. Depends on your gear/level etc. From my experience, due to competetion, world aoe grinding was not a fast way to level. Dungeon aoe groups were way faster. My fastest leveling period was 45-52 zf aoe groups and 52-60 brd aoe groups.
---
You don't need Powet Infusion. The only thing you need is around 6.1k mana to be able to kill the lashers with Holy Nova only (9 casts).
---
And I'd say Herbalism is a must as it nets me around the same gold as selling the greys does.
---
Balancing your spells at the start of a fight and your wand at the end to start mana regen will help you last longer and regenerate more as you love to the next mob.
---
But then you need to mute netflix...?
---
Your PVP lead is a NE warrior? lol..
---
Check esfands logs Vs every other classes logs
---
Haha not really, I was thinking what unit from warcraft 3 would be a cool name for my Orc and was thinking between Raider or Wolfrider, ended up choosing the latter.
---
I love these, I look forward to your little doodles, thanks!
---
scamOG?
---
As you get some gear it gets better, specially get spirit for regen and int for a larger mana pool. I leveled a mage to 60 on alliance and have a 40 mage on horde now. Basically if you’re chain pulling assuming 2-4 mobs before drinking. Also, if you’re casting high cost spells that are no efficient it will drain your mana bar. Right now it’s basically frost bolt and will improve into the 20’s when you can get shatter and reduced mana spells.
---
Thankfully I feel like these shitty posts get less and less upvotes as time goes on
---
I think it's an option from trainers at the appropriate level. Scraps upgrade to light to medium and so on. It's quite handy as many monsters give two types of leather, and usually the lesser can be upgraded to the better.
---
Imagine not looting the junk ESPECIALLY from beasts. Beasts drop easily the most valuable junk
---
And that kids, is how I clutched your mother.

lmao awesome!

i sort of like how tipsout is trying to involve himself in the dueling tournament scene and run it to stay relevant
---
god id love to see him participate , ill go right ahead and assume he just wont because he is busy running it
---
Whilst lol
---
They have to set the price higher to account for the cut. If an item costs 300g of materials to craft, and they want to make 50g profit off of it, they have to set the price to 370g instead. While someone crafting it directly can ask for a fee of 60g and still beat your price.
---
Druid/Hunter/Shaman wouldn't benefit as much since it doesn't stack with their class speed increase which they get early.
---
Those female, well endowed dwarves are more than welcome to bob for my Orcish... ummm, “apples”.
---
No job, no family, no school, and playing 10 hours a day. AKA a NEET
---
You read it right. It isn’t spell power it’s damage. Healing isn’t effected.
---
You’re going to be using distilled wisdom if anything.
---
Holy shit... you grinded that many undead mobs and only got 2... I think I’m going to stop putting my Warrior through hell trying to farm these things and just cough up the gold for the other two 16 slot bags I need.
---
&gt;	Listen up. I know the shit you’ve been saying behind my back. You think I’m stupid. You think I’m immature. You think I’m a malformed, pathetic excuse for a font. Well think again, nerdhole, because I’m Comic Sans, and I’m the best thing to happen to typography since Johannes fucking Gutenberg.
---

---
I thought so too and then I had one drop of a humanoid mob in LBRS. So definitely not only undeads drop this item
---
Ah yeah I actually got a bunch of those charms as well, about 20 or so I think. I saw they weren't worth quite as much as the elemental fire but didn't know what they were needed for.
---
100%.  Look how they ask.  When the warrior evades the question, they insist he do it anyway.  This is an experience not uncommon to warriors in classic.  Some warriors just don’t want to tank, period.
---
I am an idiot, saw the cooldown timer and assumed it was for Cower, it's for Growl. /facepalm
---
D I WHY
---
Ctr shift alt scroll up for bonus dps
---
I love when rogues try to fight my holy/prot Pali and end up killing themselves by hitting me too much.
---
Leatherworking is nice for making your own amror, and especially some high end things. Personally I felt like good agility armor is pretty rare from dungeons, though some quests offer leather and mail later on. Engineering definitelt has its utility, and probably wins out over the long run. I'm contemplating dropping leatherworking for engineer down the line when I cam just buy tons of requisite materials with gold farming after getting the main use out of armor (eventually replaced by dungeon and raid gear).
---
OP please tell me you’re Horde and on Sulfuras.
---
Mages make great alts.
---
Oh yeah that was it, you got the cast down to 1 sec, with enough haste the GCD was also 1 sec, so as long as you had a huge Mana pool and Clearcasting (which proc'd a lot) you just shit out insane damage.
---
Hey, lvl 43 mage here, trying to have some AOE capabilites ( accidental pulls of 3-6 with my rogue brother). Is sacrificing winters chill and keeping frostbite and improved blizzard tenable? wonder your thoughts. 
---

---
Here is the spec if you wanted to look.
---
Yeah, for this alliance guild, they should have given it to the enhancement shaman.
---
I'm actually leveling a moonkin, and I can't wait til I get the form in 5 levels. Loving the spec so much.
---
I have characters that are both genders. My main is a male nelf warrior, because I really like their 2h animations. But my rogue, I went human female, because I like the way they look spamming fast attacks. When I roll a druid/priest, that's probably going to be a female nelf, because I always liked the heal cast where they wiggle their fingers in front of their eyes.
---
And that's how it should be played.
---
Cursed image
---
It’s less a NEED than a DESIRE
---
Hey I failed outa college doing that too! Got them hwl swords on my rogue tho lol. Didn’t raid past bwl though. I sold off too. Wish I kept that accnt o well!
---
Yea fill us in on the 'on about'!
---
Out of curiosity, what satisfaction is there to be had from spamming frost bolt? Or any rotation that simple?
---
Hehe, thanks for the lengthy response! You're still on time with the reply, since I probably won't play until phase 3 or phase 4'ish. I believe having BGs out can give the game slightly more replay value for those who are not fortunate enough to raid.
---
Honestly just remembering quest lines and how to do quests goes a long way.  The other nice thing is giving the alt a nice set of bags so they can stay out longer before having to empty bags.
---
Do those few things and you’ll be fine.  Aside from that maybe just set them up with decent green gear.
---
You won’t really be able to boost unless you have a second account (or know someone that will help you with it).
---
Shadowmeld charges bro
---
Try threat plates.
---
Will i just be able to aoe farm when I have cone? Trying with blizzard/nova and can't kill mobs of the same lvl (22)
---
I’ve got one item, but it’s a big upgrade. I got Ring I’d Spellpower the first night we started DKP and SK.  Instantly put me at -75 DKP and behind everyone on SK.  The only good thing, other than the ring, is that I’m only 1 SK behind everyone else because it was the very first night.
---
This actually almost works? wtf
---
That's great! Glad I could help.
---
In vanilla I was mostly a carebear, avoiding world pvp. This time around, I fight every time, and am frequently surprised. Some opponents are really clever, and if I lose to them, I still have a good feeling. A lot of people have no idea what to do. They seem stuck in whatever rotation they use to level, and cannot improvise. They die quickly. Some people just freeze. I feel kinda bad for them, but that's the game! Rolling on a pvp server means accepting the added challenge.
---
I never corpse camp. I fight and move on. I don't wander into lower-level zones to gank, but I also don't show mercy to enemies just because they're lower level.
---
My first two toons in vanilla were on pve servers, and when I switched, I never went back. Enjoy!
---
You like to see the world burn hurting yourself and others? 
---
And you call yourself alliance...
---
I did like 10 laps around Goldshire looking for the flight path that must have been added in BC.
---
I'm on Grobbulus. The Roleplaying is very casual and opt in only. As it is any server I ever play. I think a lot of people have the wrong idea about roleplay servers pushed by trolls who want to think the servers are full of renaissance faire nerds so they can go to those servers and bully them.
---
The fact is, the servers are the same as any other servers, just with generally nicer people.
---
This is a much better explanation :)
---
Now if only I could explain why the water tub is sloped at like 30 degrees from the rest of the image other than the fact that I tilted my page while drawing it and didn't realise until I moved on to coloring.

I can't compete.

(Not even taking in considération the fact that it is poorly designed)  
---
\- It's supposed to be a Comic font. WoW is very far from a comic, so it clashes with the style of the game. Same as it would clash to use a gothic font in an Avengers movie for instance.

\- A lot of people find it ugly, and generally speaking people to not want to stare at something that they find ugly.

Why does it become increasingly inefficient?
---
If it was a pug, that would be pointless. You might win 3 rolls in one run, but you can also not win any roll for the next 5 runs. If there's no compensation for bad rng, there should also be no punishment for good rng.
---
Except that you can only really get away with that on a high enough pop server, where you will be invisible/unaccountable.  On a low pop server like mine, almost everyone knows everyone else, so if someone shows up and starts behaving like that, they reliably get shunned by everyone.
---
But really.
---
I really think i remember ppl calling it strat living in vanilla but not sure .. perhaps later ppl shortened it

Charge has stun, intercept has a stun, they can kick. If the mages can’t get distance, they won’t get a sheep off before being slaughtered unless they blow presence of mind.

Is there a reason to keep tailoring after making robes of the arch mage? Bags don't seem to make much money, and the 4 day timer on mooncloth is awful.

You are oppressing their virtual safe space by mining their claimed nodes and it is punishable by hanging until dead.
---
Min Maxers are cancer
---
They potentially can, but I assumed the “farming gold” meant solo farming.
---
Which item is that on his main hand
---
Nope, Battle Shout gives threat every time its cast. In Classic, refreshing a buff gives you the same amount of threat as casting it the first time.
---
Thats a TSM one right ?
---
He’s talking about loot competition in raids for them
---
I had someone once undercut me on very low level items by one copper once.  My response was to buy out all his auctions, and then send him the money I paid for them, along with a note that if he was willing to do that, then he obviously needed and cared about the money a lot more than I did.
---
I don't get angry with people like that any more.  I just feel sorry for them.  I've got a mount now and multiple pieces of blue gear, and as a tank I get sent invites and have people craft me free stuff on a regular basis.  I don't need to be a miser.
---
Cheers Stormzy
---
It's so bad still even. I run into some in other games. Lots in Overwatch and my goodness sometimes kids get bent right out of shape whether is one thing or the other
---
cool i think i remember you! I did dungeon-levelling from 30-60 as a fury/prot warrior spec
---
No, it isn't. But if you are going to be the PvP LEAD and presumably make that your main focus then race choice is *pretty important*.
---
Hunters mostly stick to tier set. Ash'kandi though......
---
mace spec is super meme, its a shit weapon for a warrior.
---
But undead pussy on the other hand...
---
Yeah mine too now, but this was a bit further back when they were still really expensive.
---
Be happy that you even got the Eye xD It should be vendored for 20g and Ingots sold to other guilds. The gold you get for guildbank is much more beneficial to a guild than 1 weapon that happens to be legendary and can be replaced by BRE or other weapons once BWL comes out. In any semi-tryhard guild the person getting the Eye would not only be locked from rolling on other 2Handers, but would also have to buy the Ingots from guildbank - they don't just get them for free. It's a weapon for meme specs and mascots.
---
All that being said, I get that something like that would be a goal for some and you should play however you want. Congrats :)
---
Good advice :)

He hasn't for a little while, but he's still active doing other stuff

Counterspell is an instant-cast that puts target into combat (so no charge), and intercept can be blinked.

Gnomes can FAP after escape and actually drop a root, or ya know... be able to use any of the other useful potions in a fight instead of being restricted to popping FAP.

I switched from Enh to Ele at 42.  I'm enjoying the experience so far with EM.  I got too tired of the RNG of WF.  Still getting used to wPvP survivability during ganks.  Also, I ran ZF last night at 43 and was OOM a majority of the time.  It was quite annoying.  Gotta downgrade some spells I believe.  I don't see too much issue with healing instances the deeper I get into resto tree.  Raiding will be a different story altogether.
---
Ok, is simply the 0.8% hit from skill enough to overcome the dps difference?
---
What you think is enough stam? Im 4k unbuffed hp.
---
I don't agree with OP. But killing a lower level char is not PVP. It's a slaughter lol. It's really no contest who is going to win. A kill for the sake of a kill....with no honor system. Thay being said, you csn always roll PVE. Personally, I never gank low lvl chars because there is no enjoyment in it.
---
who said anything about arms?
---
I typically price at 30-60% above vendor, and my goods always sell, generally within two hours.  I routinely get bought out by obvious flippers, and I don't mind at all.  I want a consistent, reliable stream of revenue over a long period of time, to the point where I don't mind if it is small.  If the flippers want to buy my stuff and then spin the roulette wheel, that is totally up to them.  I don't want that risk.
---
My father stayed poor by constantly looking for unrealistically big scores economically, and he taught me not to do it myself as a result.
---
It was kinda a joke. Druids do suffer from all of those things unfortunately. I think they're still viable tanks for certain fights all the way into naxx. I don't know for sure though. Just won't be a ton of room for them. I play an unwanted spec, but it's the most fun in the game.
---
You forgot because they really aren't. But they are fun so I hope we see more.
---
Lmao play whatever you want but if you are going to pretend to be PvP focused and call yourself the PvP leader of a guild you probably shouldn't have fucked up the first step in character creation.

Plus they don't need any clothes or armor for that matter in retail. That game is so easy you can solo dungeons naked!

What's wrong with it? lol.

You usually wanna AoE farm at a spot thats a few levels under you for less chance of resists, its a gamechanger if 1 mob resists or all get frost nova’d. So you can AoE farm without Cone of Cold but it surely helps when you get it.

Just don't overaggro, Shadow priests are excellent at Ragnaros due to the nature of ranged aggro, other than that, they always overaggro.
---
Yeah, it happened on my server a few months after BC was out. Incredibly annoying.
---
EverQuest_ was taken
---
I play female, I am female.
---
Not playing the best combination is fine but playing the absolute worst as PvP lead..
---
Feels like all the bloodelf players are playing NE now.
---
Almost all of the good gear is robes
---
Yea we were running it with full guild run shaman heals, spriest, lock, mage,  with me fury tanking since gettin to arena is cake
---
you over estimate how strong those pots are lol.
---
the pot lasts something like 30 seconds with a 2m cooldown.
---
so heres a senario, warrior spots me (an elemental mage...frost+Fire specd) and pops his free action pot then charges me (and i somehow dont see em coming), he hits me, i see the shit around his feet that means "DONT NOVA U IDIOT" and i just poly him. i then go to near max range and just repeat that til the effect around his feet falls off. then i pyroblast him into a rank 1 frost bolt and just perma kite til he dies. using blink to avoid his intercept
---
the only time a free action pot wins the fight for the warrior in War V mage is if the mage is dumb. the mage can just ice block alot of the dmg (lasts 10 seconds) and negate even more with mana shield + ice barrier. lil bit of fake casting to avoid the interrupt and you can poly with the warrior on top of you. and if you arnt dealing dmg to him the warriors dmg falls off sharply due to a lack of rage. 
---
and this senario assumes the mage isnt also using free action pots, that prevent stuns and slows...which fucks up a warriors whole shtick.
---
for a warrior to even have a chance, he would need alot of trinkets like the fire/frost reflect ones and to hope the person doesnt recognize there animations. even with the phase 2 pvp trinket his chances of surviving is slim, you basically have to 1 shot a mage through there barriers. but any competent pvp mage is going to have 3500-4000 hp in blues as spell dmg is fairly meh for mages in pvp, so that means the warrior would have too deal something like 5500 dmg across the time it takes to the mage to cast poly (1.5 base cast so we'll say 2-3 seconds with fakes woven in) which is possible with alot of good crits, its just not consistent. so most of the time that warrior is going to simply waste the pot.
---
those pots are great in larger scale pvp and bg type senario's, but in any time a warrior is left alone with a mage...hes probably fucked. pot or not
---
He thinks this is how elite guilds raised in vanilla.
---
It wasn’t, even when my guild wiped 60 times on a boss in AQ, we tried to be positive.

I got the frost dmg cloak :D
---
Fun fact- I’m dyslexic and find comic sans easy to read compared to normal fonts in the game. The weird spacing with letters actually helps me. 
---
So I unironically did this as well
---
Shhhh let them fish else where
---
I remember trying to play the beta on a laptop....the view distance was like...30 yards. Lots of ghosts on a low refresh rate LCD.
---
Yet it was still a blast.
---
Agreed. I do a lot of pug dungeons as well, &amp; it helps there a ton. I’ll probably move away from it after I grab the last piece of BiS (rosewine) &amp; don’t pug as much.
---
So many times did I try to heal that human warlock...
---
I dropped for herb then other profession is engineering. Once ZG releases you may want to consider picking it up again for the crafted set bonus.

Combat rogue question:
---
I got myself a Krol Blade, what would be a good and easily attainable off-hand to use with it (excluding Dal'rends)?
---
Are Trash Blade or Assassination Blade good alternatives, or are they too slow?
---
you realize its also shit for arms warrior, right?
---
That isn’t not uncorrect, no.
---
You know what’s even trashier?  Shitting on other people for no reason then posting yourself being a dick on Reddit thinking you’re being cool.
---
Have u never heard of swifty and his shadowmeld macro
---
Wowhead guide on herb has the best routes listed for leveling. Recommend checking it out
---
That’s just lazy
---
It is, they put in an artificial delay known as spell batching which can make spells feel, I believe, 100-400ms slower
---
i know there is no reason to min/max, i just want to.
---
Thought it may have been
---
Why, so the paladin could auto attack with it? It's basically only useful in pvp for alliance, and they gave it to their pvp coordinator.
---
you sum up just about all dps specs
---
2 bag slots isnt worth 50G to you?
---
yep frost isnt really a pve spec. it obviously does fine because fire is useless before AQ but its a pvp spec at its core. which is why its dmg rotation is basically just spamming 1 key over and over again. its mechanic's are based on controlling targets and bursting...not sustaining dmg on non ccable targets.
---
Or when you are literally standing on the ore to loot it while fighting a mob and a guy mines it from underneath you. I would let him take the second hit if he just would fucking ask but no just ninja the shit and move on, complete dick thing to do.
---
Thank you, maybe I have to stop being picky :D
---
Not gonna lie, that's kind of weird.
---
Well for the Druid you’d have to respec depending on how you want to play. Fury is crap in PVP and you’ll have to tank in prot for end game dungeons too. 
---
Lock is probably the only class where you can do both in the same spec.
---
So basically I need to sell this for as much as I can now so somewhere between 200-300g most likely before price drops too much
---
Agreed...not sure why this guy is “boasting” about the time he spent getting triggered by another player.
---
Everything?
---
Shadowmeld is useless is classic
---
Like?
---
&gt;If they wanna dps a dungeon and no one accepts them as a dps class in their group how is that their fault?
---
Because there is a tank shortage and they do less dps than other classes who can't tank.
---
Gratz dude, sorry I couldn't be there. Valravn 😎
---
It’s viable but without more spellpower and Crit chance Arcane/Frost does far far more damage at this point in the game
---
people who says this are usually those parsing grey on retail
---
Yeah I’m confused here, are they 100% basing this opinion on how easy it is to gear because of competition?  Because mages are amazing end level for every aspect of the game.  World pvp, bgs, gold farming, raiding, 5 mans....
---
No, they are roommates who play together (second hand knowledge)
---
If you have more than 3 locks, if anything the extra locks *might* be able to put up corruption for the Nightfall procs. But no way there's enough debuff slots in a 40-man for Curse of Agony.
---
Maybe we should all revisit the cleaner after we clear naxx
---
Maaann. Classic has made me salty af. Someone trying to take my skins I just worked for? Taking my chest I just cleared out an ENTIRE camp for? Nah "go f*ck yourself, m8"
---
There are two types of draenei:

Male,  and shemale.
---
Chill out Kylo.
---
What item does that? The other day I saw a gnome paladin very confusing lol
---
I regret buying mine. I rarely use it over the BRD mace.
---
They are both horde players and I am an alliance player
---
Most of us have agreed that we leave them alone, but they still get ganked.
---
Maybe they come back to kill because of this very reason. Hmm?!?.... Lol
---
let's stop pretending like any of the wow classes are difficult.
---
If the tank is doing fury tanking, it is very possible that ret is lower.
---
Real shit someone in my city named their kid Kyloren lmao
---
Might have mistaken him for a bot
---
Fire has far less survivability and control than frost, which makes it less fun for me.
---
Sure, but doing extra work is the price you pay for wanting to play a shit spec.
---
You do more work than other people and that means you won't pull your whole raid team down(as much).
---
The buffs have been active for 20 minutes, food buffs last 15 minutes.
---
They clearly just got done clearing trash, literally just finished (see: health). 
---
Nice Reddit detective attempt, but ya should've held off judgement on this one IMO.
---
Cool bro. Haven't played "retail" since the end of WotLK, don't know what else to tell you. If you think mashing ten buttons thousands of times is complicated then more power to you
---
In his defense the dudes name is literal trash..
---
I mean...it could be.
---
Yes but what does that have to do with disenchanting? I think the nexus question answered that. Leveling enchanting to 300 is super expensive for anyone, let alone an alt.
---
Pretty much everyone who got to 60 shortly after launch is leveling alts now. You’re good. 👍
---
I think he's referring to JoshOG.
---
Cuz we are shit talking? Should we apply /s tags for your sensitive soul?
---
Yeah, my point is, it's not really useful for raiders, so didn't really matter who gets it, from a raiding perspective
---
A tank is literally the guy tanking the boss. Trying to change the definition so hybrids look better is dumb.
---
I got ganked myself when i first tried my Benediction quest. I suddenly noticed shadow word: pain on me and noticed a priest sneaking up on me. I could still survive a bit but ultimately failed my quest.
---
Following this event i gathered some guildmates and we camped him until he eventually could escape to the stratholme entrance.
---
A few days ago we encountered him again near dire maul and corpse camped him for a while.
---
Basically: That guy is now on every kos-lists in my guild. I hope the poor guy reads your apology.
---
Really wish respeccing was less expensive atm xD Wanna play around with fire a bit but then it costs a lot to respecc back to frost QQ
---
lol dude, you're silly. reread the guys name.
---
If I use both, the percentage will be on right side and the numeric value to the left..  I only want the exact hp, just like in the twitch vod! Any clue?
---
:(
---
Just wait until you have your OEB and can two shot us.
---
yes fire mage is the real pve spec because its about damage whereas frost is for control and survivability. but cant really go fire when youre doing MC.
---
it was a joke, but i guess you'd have to have the ability to read to get that.
---
On my server in vanilla it was east and west strat, or west strat and dead strat.
---
yeah, i don't think people here are the brightest group of gamers. no worries.
---
I am annoyed with people doing this with arcane crystals. There is never a ton of crystals posted at one time. People are so desperate to undercut they are driving the price down by 5-7g of what it normally sells for. A crystal will sell eventually, no need to undercut. And the deposit is peanuts. I will typically buy up 2 of the lowest price and re list, but I can't buy them all up with how much undercutting is happening rn
---
I would rather sell it to people who are using it for 30s than vendor it
---
I'm really not. At best, you're half a real DPS, you just can't compete and that is fucking fact. And you buffing Warlocks who are also doing poor damage this phase isn't enough to warrant bringing you over a Rogue, Warrior or Mage. Telling the OP everything will be OK and people will welcome him with open arms is just bullshit because that's not the experience he will get at 60. I mean hell, we have an Elemental Shaman and Shadow Priest in our guild, so it's possible but you better be friends with the GM, and when it comes to dungeons you better have a fixed group because no one is inviting a Shadow Priest unless they can't get anything else.
---
If ur looking for the addon ONLY for debuffs its a weakaura. The ameplates are ElvUI.
---
Warlock is ridiculous at Naxx end game
---
He's to hard.

I agree with almost everything here but in what way are abbreviations, acronyms, or initializations unintelligent? They are used in everything, everywhere. WOW classic?! It's WORLD OF WARCRAFT IDIOT
---
Reminds me of that George Carlin joke: "Have you ever noticed that anybody driving slower than you is an idiot, and anyone going faster than you is a maniac?"
---
HE'S TOO DANGEROUS TO BE LEFT ALIVE
---
Yeah I see him get demolished in most duels on his stream and he has twice the gear of the people hes fighting. Then he loses and talks about how he'll win the next one with some oneshot recklessness macro shit. Still living like its 2005.
---
It's trolling? In what world is that trolling?
---
Warlocks are the best. The current most popular spec and playstyle for leveling a warlock is outlined in this excellent document: [Dive's Drain Tanking Guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qdUs229_XvkR1NCeTrJkybL5BDXGIh7q/view).
---
Looks line weakauras and omni cc, recommend you search for debuff nameplates on wago.io
---
Its easy as an undead. Just take out your teeth and put them in your hand.
---
U got my sub mate, looking forward for another vids.
---
I'll agree to that. But once we stop pretending that any classes are difficult, can we circle back to my question of why anyone gets some sense of pride from topping dps meters by hitting one key over and over?
---
That doesn't make much sense to me. If your goal is maximizing your efficiency than total for the raid should be the main metric. It doesn't take into account sheer zerging power as much as it does who is switching targets quickly, maximizing uptime, not going AFK or whatever else. It's a metric of your overall raid performance and ranks the DPS according to how well they perform under pressure and in conditions that are changing rapidly.
---
I get that some people are interested in sheer damage output which is great -- but at that point you may as well just attack a training dummy (if we had them).
---
My hunter is level 20 right now, as I’m just a casual player. Honestly, I’ve only used the AH for some green boes that have dropped for me and some greens that I have crafted. I haven’t had luck with posting materials, I think due to the large number of people posting materials in stacks of 1, which just bogs down the whole AH experience. I vendor pretty much everything that drops (I always loot trash items, that little bit of copper adds up)... which means lots of trips back to town to empty my bags of trash from the mobs. But it adds up. It’s been enough to get my training for both my class, pet, and professions. I’m picky about what I train, and only train the things I NEED to keep leveling. My main is a skinner/leatherworker and I sell some of the greens I craft by putting them at a much lower price on AH than similar items. I usually undercut green items by 10s or more. As long as I list it for more than I would vendor it for, I’ll list it. Might be able to get more for them, but at this level (in my opinion) getting some silver is better than having the items come back to me in the mailbox to repost. 
---
Also, I use Auctionator as an add on to help with posting auctions and to see the vendor and auction prices in the tool tip.
---
ClassicLFG
---
Maybe pick up skinning and vendor leather. Can pay for spells easily at start, at least in my experience did. You can drop it for more suitable prof anytime and don't feel bad for it.
---
&gt;t's 10 different buttons or one. I would rather just press one.
---
Sometimes I wonder why people like you even play the game.
---
Grats man!
---
Yea this exactly... I see people trying to dual wield fury tank in not even full tier one. This early on heal power is not strong enough, let alone the raids gear as an entirety. I think fury prot with 1h shield is really good, people just need to get over the fact they take too much damage dual wield tanking raid bosses lol. I’d raid is in farm and the majority of your raid is well over geared, then it is a considerable option, but until then, I’d rather have one tank and one less dps lol.
---
Honestly it’s probably a toss up which one is better. I’d probably go for the axe though for the hit, especially if you’re less than 56 or so
---
Generally you want to switch to shadow later, around 45.
---
I grind yetis, satyrs, and furblong dudes on mine. Easy kills and yetis can be skinned. Satyrs give you demonic runes and recipes, and furblong give you rep.
---
But of course you can sell it to a raiding guild. Currently you have two things working against you. The abundance of people turning in the quest and the cooldown on/delay in between Warchief's Blessing events.
---
It is difficult to put a price tag on a Rend head in P1.
---
The class lead, or PvP lead in this case, should be the most knowledgeable about the matters pertaining to their leadership role. This suggest a pretty big lacking of that kind of PvP knowledge. It's ok, you aren't stupid, just wrong.
---
There should be some sort of blacklist for trash like this.
---
Thats it.
---
I imagine mages and druids "could" do it but it'd be hella ineffective
---
Exactly.. I ran out in silverpine on my warlock so ended up over in the barrens till I was high enough to go back to finish silverpine, got to get all the wc quests and a run in before going back and got some nice rewards that made leveling easier.
---
It's a joooke-uhhh! It's FUNNY they got so mad about a game!
---
Oh the Horror.
---
Can you set that up in a talent calc?
---
Very intrigued!
---
That is even worse if they are giving HoR to someone not even going for PvP ranks..
---
They actually released Comic Sans in October 1994! Happy 25th Birthday Comic Sans
---
Hi, thank you all for your comments.
---
The first issue is werd, but as some of you stated, /reloadui works, so I just made a macro for it and I will just trigger it when I log on, no big deal.
---
Regarding the second question, I kind of got used to it, so I will leave it as it is for some time, and I will see, maybe I will use some more sofisticated macro later on. I just started with the druid, so I only have bear form yet :))
---
But thanks!

---
Between Lock and Spriest, are they about even or is one way better?
---
ROFL, not at all. bre and spinal reaper are vastly superior, its probably on par with obsidian edged blade.
---
Are you the dude on yojamba? Mad respect
---
I'm going to formally put in a request for you to change it back.
---
Try selling in smaller than full stacks.  Think about who is buying copper bars right now and why they'd buy stacks vs single bars.  More than likely someone is missing 1 bar for a skill up than needing a full stack.  There are few people switching professions and power leveling 1-300 right now.  You also might've made a mistake smelting it all because you miss out on the market of people that want to double dip and smelt it themselves for the skill up.
---
My pet (raptor) is tanking for me, and taking down 1 or 2 mobs at a time is pretty easy. I've been trying to save up to buy a stable slot so I can start learning pet skills. The only times I've been having issues is when questing, since a lot of mobs are tightly clustered and it's hard to manage 2 threat zones (my pet and me at a distance). My bow is really low level so it still takes a while to gun a mob down
---
Sure you can run other instances as Fire. But raiding it’s not as good due to MC being the main raid right now. 
---
When ZG, AQ are out then Fire is good.
---
He found a way to launder all that gold
---
Having a few dagger rogues is a great idea. Helps with weapon diversity.
---
That looks like an addon that assists you in finding groups. Does it really remove LFG/LFM messages from the chat? If yes do I need to set it up in a certain way or so?
---
Bindings is only from Garr &amp; Baron Geddon I believe.

You got a great style dude. Keep it up!

Selling ores instead of bars makes sense. I was smelting them in Razor Hill to save bag space so I could bring a bigger haul back to Org to bank/AH. I definitely have enough bars to level engineering so I can save those and start selling ore haha.
---
really shouldnt cencor the names in cases like this. its not like it's his real name.
---
And every alliance player comes onto Reddit to complain and whine about it
---
No, of course not. The trouble is, not every situation is as obvious or as  binary as the situation you and he presented.  That situation doesn't capture the complexity that these situations can sometimes have. 
---
To that point, the original situation presented in this thread was, I believe, a Warrior rolling for a dagger against a Rogue, with the consideration being that:
---
(a) the Fury warrior can make excellent use of the dagger (as an off hand), and;
---
(b) combat swords are objectively better than daggers for pve damage as a Rogue, so they both should have a shot at the dagger on paper. (While I haven't done the math behind swords vs daggers for pve damage, I do know the community consensus is that swords beat daggers for pve, at least with the currently available items.) 
---
Now, every situation is going to be different because of the items in question but also the players, too. For example, the Rogue might really want to go daggers but hadn't had daggers to do so effectively, and this drop would be the clincher. In that case, while both might be entitled to roll, it complicates the situation. Again, that's when you need strong raid leadership. Imo, yes, the Warrior can roll. 
---
As an example that happened to me, the Blackstone Ring dropped for me as a Rogue a few weeks ago, and a feral Druid beat me on the roll. Objectively, I would imagine (not having done any math) that ring gets more damage output on paper for a Rogue than it does a Druid. That said, it was an upgrade, and while I was momentarily salty, I believe that his eligibility for rolling on the ring was valid.
---
You have to kite him until he's low enough for you to take him on directly. I'm kiting him around that big pillar in the water but you have to be very careful not to bug him out because if you go too close to the pillar he evades and messes you up.

Little know fact! Forsaken players can actually use a hack to break fear and charm effects every 2 minutes. If a GM asks, you didn’t hear it from me though.
---
Yeah you're right, I just keep thinking it drops off Rag considering it is such a more useful item than Sulfuras, of *course* it should be off the last bossᴮᵘᵗ ⁿᵒᵗ ʳᵉᵃˡˡʸ
---
Horde or alliance?
---
Ragnaros does far more fire damage to a tank than physical. I just checked the log of my last rag kill, and my raid's tank in heavy fire resist gear had 27% of the total damage taken be physical and 73% was fire damage. So fire resist is more important.
---
I’m a 60 lock. Please tell me how I can solo. The final boss pulls a ton of adds that I feel like makes it impossible
---
That's fine for you
---
Not for a PvP leader
---
I could not take that guy srsly as a pvper but that's just me
---
PvP? Working together to accomplish goals? Friends? If you play the game because of the PvE rotations... Raiding is and always will be about reaction, coordination, teamwork, and consistency not how well people smash their keyboards in complex logarithmic functional rotations. Hate to break it to you but there is nothing complex about anything to do with classic raiding, especially ony and mc. Press a few buttons, move, press a few buttons, don't group up, press a few buttons, don't stand in fire. Do you actually think there is anything difficult or complex about any of these rotations in classic? I have to press one button so I can much more easily keep an eye out on the raid, help direct people, and help others learn the mechanics. You are smashing ten buttons with one hand while the other is on your miniscule shaft buried under your rotten fupa with your eyes glued to the meters.
---
Why?  Isn’t the level process wand spec -&gt; shadow?  At 40 respect for shadow form.  At 45 you would have got wand spec again.  Or is disc the leveling flavor now?
---
Maybe they WANTED to, who cares about classic gold dude.
---
Ok ill def try with barov trinket!
---
We both got engi so maybe dragonlin pet aswell
---
Best you can get is a chance to stum from a desto talent
---
Yeah true, but you might want the option to use shield wall as its your only (albeit powerful) defensive cooldown as an arms warrior
---
At level 18, he could run his friend through BFD and do the quest for gravestone scepter wand. That’s will be the best wand for the 20s and well into the 30s.
---
I helped a friend start a paladin and one of the things I did was give him the materials to level engineering a little to use bombs. Its minor thing but does speed up his kill times and is a nice "oh shit" button.
---
True, we got a mage friend with DE, might be worth it
---
The weapon is shit
---
This matches more or less with our MT damage taken checking logs for 3 weeks it is around 30% give or take a few percent.
---
Spell power weapon enchant also says damage but still works on healing. It's dangerous to trust wording in classic.
---
BAGS
---
Look at all that screen real estate taken up by the dmg meter. This guy dps's.
---
Great story.  How much did you buy and sell the character for?
---
yo TAUNT
---
Need? You’re a rogue!?
---
You get cookie and then BFD wand in 20s.
---
Melee goes afk while the others kill the boss. They can run in at the end if they want to
---
So, this advice may be controversial, and it depends a lot on your healers. I have really strong healers, so it works out well and helps dungeon runs go quickly: While tanking, I have barely any defense on my gear. I am wearing dps plate, and I even use 1 leather piece (Mask of the Unforgiven, need that hit) but I hope to replace that once I get 1% more hit.
---
In this gear setup, I tank with 6% hit (human, so soft cap) and 21% crit (defensive stance) unbuffed. I still have around 6600 armor, and shied block makes me crit/crush immune vs bosses, so I am still fairly durable. I am also specced fury/prot, so the crit and hit helps maintain around an 80% uptime on flurry, which makes my rage generation much better.
---
Keep in mind: I still use a shield most of the time. Though my healers and I are starting to get to the point where I can dual wield some pulls (caster pulls, easier dungeons, etc), and when I can do this, I can keep threat on 5-6 mobs at once, even with aoeing dps, simply because I have so much rage.
---
I'm daggers, never been turned away for using barman's. Maybe I'm lucky
---
Thank you! Razorgore EU
---
It’s warlocks only weapon against rogue stealth attacks so it shouldn’t be downgraded unless perm stun is downgraded first
---
I was running Strat Live for orbs (needed gold for mount quest) and for the necklace from Bal. Cape of Shadow wrath dropped. I nutted. 
---
Sometimes, if the BIS drop would require too much RNG to drop, I find it just fine to deal with optional replacements. Getting it to drop is simply icing on the cake.
---
That's just because it's easier to get invited to a raid if you're a mage. That's not a bad thing.
---
I answered if I got the drakestone or not, reading comprehension is hard I know
---
Did they confirm this or you're just going off of how it worked in vanilla?
---
well it wasn't enough water to put a little fire out anxway so yeah sell the rest
---
Sepsis
---
So you still recommend hitting the 315 fire res cap? At any cost, essentially?
---
I may not want to hear that, but I can and will do that if that's what it takes, heh.
---
Hunters
---
Oh shut the fuck up already, you sound so obnoxious
---
You might even say druids are situationally better than locks at the AoE game. Gsther 'em up, barkskin, hurricane, hot yourself and moonfire... possibly insect swarm.

Or Maybe after hurricane hot yourself then bear and swipe:)

He’s actually not that bad at warrior pvp, not that it’s particularly difficult, but I think you’re being a bit hyperbolic.

AFAIK the construction thing was his father and not him. You can argue apple doesn’t fall far from the tree, but don’t think you can attribute blame like you said.

Agreed he seems like an asshole, but just stick to facts to paint him as an asshole. No point in exaggerating, just diminishes your argument.

It appears that you couldn't know less about what you are talking about.

Honestly I don't blame any women who do this. The thirst from some people once they find out someone's a female is ridiculous

I really empathize with the fail sons of the privileged and elite. We should never hold them accountable for their behavior or actions. Us huddled masses are just too stupid and ignorant to understand all the complex nuances of being gifted an executive spot at daddy's company.
---
It's great for dyspraxia since each letter is unique.
---
It is going to be a constant battle to get group or raid invites
---
I just started leveling a Mage after my Warlock and I hate it so far. Having to drink so often is driving me crazy.
---
I wasn't exaggerating.
---
I have never expected anybody to farm anything for me, my whole application for prio was based around how I had planned to farm it, but unfortunately as a ret paladin solo farming DM:E is entirely impossible. All i really need is a few people who have Alchemy and Enchanting to help me run that dungeon. But yes, I see how my comment may have come across
---
The cavalry horn was perfect
---
This is offensive to dwarves.
---
Bud, man, and dude are pretty universal. Man is technically a little weird, but it's pretty normal the way society uses it in context
---
If you have a "rotation" of certain skills it already implies that you have a set routine you'll be following throughout the fight. That routine being 1 skill or 5 skills doesn't matter. You don't have to actively think about how these skills work or what is needed and when. You'll just press a certain button sequence over and over. If pretending that that's more complicated than spamming frostbolt then all the power to you.
---
Got that cloak on my first run while I was already wearing a green +20 from the ah. I'd rather have used that luck on a briarwood reed or that god damn wand. Fwiw i also got headmaster's charge on my first run through scholo on a greed roll. Yay.
---
But then your playing a gnome lol
---
You sound butthurt you rolled a meme spec and cant get into raids. It's ok, downvoting me will make everything better.
---
&lt;Atal Alarion&gt; is a Troll-only guild on Grobbulus NA. This video uses footage from roughly a month's worth of RP-PvP events that &lt;Atal Alarion&gt; either organized or attended. [You can see a previous video here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdKqJYCJ1ao)
---
Special thanks to the awesome Grobbulus Horde RP community for making the events shown in this video possible.
---
Don’t ask for a tip, ask for a fee.  Value your time.
---
What do you fellow mages dislike the most about your class?
---
For me it's the fact we are so good, raids are filled with us and we rarely get loot. I've done 5 weeks of molten core and gotten one piece of loot. While rogues, warlocks, druids and hunters are close to full epic. 
---
Loot distribution has been fair though. It's the same for every mage in my guild.
---
This might be more of a dislike for me personally since I originally wanted to be a warlock. 
---
I still love being a mage though
---
Are Druid tanks hard to gear? Leveling and end game.
---
Such a good looking sword
---
Top tier, low quality shit post.
---
Oh hi. Whisper me in game when you see me online and we can work something out probably :) 
---
I snipe AH yes and I know some of you see it as a shitty thing to do but my gold comes mostly from people who post at their intended price just slightly under valued. I usually work something out with people who whisper me (and is not an ass about it) when they fuck up this badly.
---
Crazy rare!
---
dude ty so much lol...
---
Why would you do this?!
---
I killed 5 in a row uncontested on my server yesterday.
---
Dark pact is one of the most powerful leveling talents by far.  You can always respec to a raid spec at 60
---
Absolutely. If you can't do it without coc you need to practice more. If you go oom you need to get more int gear.
---
Yeah from 40-42 all i did was farm the lower tanaris turtles and made like 100g
---
Yeah, I'm 58 and have 3 pieces of gear from MC in my bank, cant wait to get to 60.
---
This is why I loved vanilla wow and love classic!
---
Interesting, I think I might give this a shot, I love uncamped spawns though I do not think I would survive the oozes. You are very good.  Did you use different ranks of Blizzard on that last pull?
---
Fully agree.
---
He must be providing a great service to his guild setting up SOCIAL events. 
---
I hope you can see how setting up SOCIAL events in a SOCIAL community might gain you some SOCIAL capital within said community? To the point that the character is likely well-liked.
---
HoR is arguably more of a RP weapon than a PVP weapon on Alliance anyway. Only really that good when you have windfury procs...
---
A strong counter-point. Dwarf and Human are both superior to choices to NE though.
---
What now?
---
Just go deep frost without frostbite and you are set with dps. Manage your mana well and you will be close to top dps on every boss fight you don't need to decurse.
---
Asmongpld "wipes his bleeding gums on his wall"?
---
I thought that data wasn’t accurate
---
Shadow isn't particularly better than holy until 40. Though silence gives you an edge in pvp.
---
what do aerosmith have to do with it. poser band but SMH
---
Man I don't know why so many people used those hideous unit frames in vanilla... they don't even offer any advantage over stock.
---
Those examples you gave at the end aren't Tips, js.
---
And warrior is what 3 buttons? Its not like 3 button mash is any harder or more interesting than one.
---
Eww

And so the cycle continues 😔
---
I went prot the moment the game had a release date...
---
We had killed twins in aq40 before trying naxx
---
That name makes me wonder if it’s serious business...
---
Never realized how cool that weapon looked
---
Haha yes I've been lucky with some great BoEs
---
I’m 2h fury and absolutely demolish dungeons as a tank. With a good plate DPS set, and knowing when to use your shield, I’d argue it’s better for dungeons to not be prot. 
---
I occasionally end up in a group with a prot warrior and it just slows down the run. My healer friends prefer to run with me over prot warriors. Faster clear speed, better AOE threat generation.
---
No it isn't, the gold inflation makes leveling a bit easier since you can auction your items for more, so its easier to afford skills and a mount.  
---
By the time you are 60 most people will have completed their BiS lists so there's less competition for upgrades. There might also be a new raid around then, which evens the playing field. A full mc geared character can only get upgrades from the BWL raid, but a fresh 60 can get upgrades from both raids, meaning double the chances for epics over a raid reset.
---
And even after all that, on pservers there were always new guilds coming up and doing MC even when naxx was already out. There are always plenty people who are at your level to play with.
---
Bis for hunters smh
---
https://i.imgur.com/9etwdzT.png
---
Im not running any dedicated groups, and I have had zero issues finding group as either class
---
Hahahaha, too true. There were like 6 Lvl 60 horde outside stormwind city killing quest givers. I went to stormwind a few times to ask for help, while there were hundreds of 60s in the city, not a single one could even be bothered to respond, allowing the horde filth to desecrate the doorstep of Stormwind. 
---
So as the only honourable alliance member on the server, I charged them as a Level 7 and instantly died a glorious death.
---
That rag fight was great
---
“Learn how to Econ” - proceeds to threaten you for not complying to illegal cartel Price fixing scheme.
---
Thanks for the information. Never knew this about him. Scum.
---
"Look guys, a new Mold. I don't think Ive ever seen one this color before."
---
I bought a full set of int / stam / spirit greens from AH, worked perfectly
---
Fire is literally spamming fireballs in raids tho
---
After you get the bindings you need a drop off rag, but that's a guaranteed drop
---
its not. both bre and spinal reaper are both significantly better.
---
FR caps at 315
---
new night elf unit... isnt that night elf from the original wow trailer lol
---
I still dont understand how people cant afford $15 rofl
---
Like are you 14? If so offer to do some yardwork for your parents

^ This
---
Everyone should be good at *something* but no one should be good at *everything*
---
It's fine for class A to get utterly dominated by class B so long as class B gets utterly dominated by class C.
---
Druids may not be able to 1v1 a warlock but they utterly dominate mages and they can carry a flag in a way that every other class wishes they could.
---
They are just driven by envious hate
---
Thanks, I hate it
---
tips is garbage, he stole most of his content from other creators prior to classic launch.
---
No, my spec was wrong, but fun in PvP. There was no raiding guides everywhere on the Internet at this time. I remember respecing to sm/ruin in late vanilla tho.
---
Sheep
---
My guild and guildmates helped me with around 80% of the cost. Their support blew me away.
---
&gt;But yeah, 300 FR before the UBRS buff is good.
---
That's way too much FR, it caps at 315
---
As a GM I hope you bring proof. I would always defend my own guildmembers against claims of bad behaviour when no proof is offered, otherwise It could just as easily be someone being emotional over losing a roll in a dungeon or whatever and wanting to badmouth the guildie.
---
Are you suggesting that there's people out there raiding as 2h fury?
---
Holy crap you fished a epic raptor mount?!?
---
Why is arcane not the thing?
---
He is just a hater, trying to ruin the game like he ruined retail (or people like him)
---
at your level you can really use mana shield or blink. costs too much
---
Love your spit macro
---
You can. You lock your raid ids after the first boss kill.
---
Do you understand you no damage and I have a blink root two slows poly ice barrier? You literally stand no chance. Your class is trash, sorry bro
---
You cant get shadowform until level 40, I swapped at 40 and it was fine
---
I usually did Mind Blast &gt; SW:Pain &gt; Mind Flay &gt; Mind Flay &gt; Wand
---
Point me to a complex classic pve rotation please.
---
Everything is just as easy as spamming fb over and over again.
---
Maybe you have to pay attention at something like a rogue's slice and dice but is that really engaging?
---
Ppl used cons and food buffs there as much as possible back then as well lol..You not gonna use them at trash and after every wipe
---
What server do you play on? I came back to wow and so did my cousin and he picked a pve server and man is it boring.
---
They argue that something "iSnT eVeN GoOd FoR yOuR cLaSs"
---
It's a Stat increase, go fuck yourself
---
If you want to explore a bit, check out Shimmering Flats - loads of quests from that hub. If one of you has Skinning it's even better.
---
It's worth running south from there to get the Tanaris Flightpath too, while you're down there.
---
Sometimes it's worth just seeing where the road leads. I wish I could experience the game first time again, since by now I never have a chance of getting lost or unaware of what to do - enjoy the learning process and try not to overdo analysis or "prepping for endgame" since the most fun is figuring it out for yourself rather than merely reading a guide or having someone instruct you on every little detail - easy way to suck the fun out and get burnt out and jaded when the game becomes a spreadsheet rather than an adventure.
---
Enjoy it!
---
Well, yeah. That's the plan. The way shadow leveling (or farming) works is that you have no down time. SWP, maybe MB and then Wand. Shield yourself whenever you can. Literally no downtime.
---
Look up Troxxed, we was Gm of Bloodlegion During Vanilla/BC I beleive. He trumps anyone you could think of, but still had one of the most loyal raid teams you could ask for.
---
Check your raid info in the raid tab. There's been a bug this week where people got saved without killing any bosses so you might've been affected.
---
Ideally yes. You can buy a lot of greens on AH with fire resist, not just rings.
---
There are also crafted gear that gives FR, like volcanic leather, and dark iron plate
---
I wouldn’t say dumb, just impatient. I have been beaten by a few rogues who kept resetting the fight, but if they rush it and get too low then sotr judgement+HoW is usually enough to burst them down from like 30% or so.
---
It’s funny how you say play what you want and then you say a guild that’s playing the way they want is the wrong guild. Pretty hypocritical.
---
Eeeehhhhhhhhh
---
I've used DW up to my current lvl, 58. I can't stand questing with 2h since they're so slow and you're not getting any rage. I only use 2h in dungeons, fury spec is a lot more fun than arms imo regardless of which weapon you use.
---
I get certain swords while leveling. I know when i get them. I keep using them till I get to the next set.
---
The most effective way as shadow is also abusing the wand. This way you are never oom and have no down time.
---
Organizational and leading skills matter way more than a simple class pick. If you can't have fun playing as a particular race, your effectivness with it will drop no matter what. Also Following a nelf is better than following a fing gnome.
---
It is much easier to progress in raids as Alliance.  Dwarf priests have fear ward and Paladins are a healing class that literally can't go oom with the right gear.
---
As someone who is playing Tauren, having a larger hit box is not necessarily a good thing for pvp.
---
But...the bots add to the authenticity? /s
---
If the function of a font is just an un-understandable concept to you, that is fine. Hell, maybe you'd even like the use of an impossible-to-read-in-movement cursive tattoo font on signs on the freeway. But that doesn't change the fact that Design is *all* about function.
---
I parsed orange on every mythic boss I raided ever since WoD and I agree with what he's saying.
---
It literally doesnt matter, bosses are easy, rotations are easy every pve content is a joke so why even care.
---
What’s the ‘b’ stand for?
---
Ya I wouldn't accuse someone of being a ninja without screenshots. But I'm sure people do it.
---
Yes you do. 
---
Also as a tip for high level, or if you go alchemy and want to use healing potions or other consummables. Use this macro. 
---
#showtooltip Item Name
---
/cancelform
---
/use Item Name
---
/cast Dire Bear Form
---
Suddenly, you can now use consummables ( Which, pots, warlock cookies ) aren't on the GCD, so you can use this to immediately jump back into bear form after potion. Its pretty much instant. 
---
Great when you need emergency hp in an end dungeon, or have to use that stoneshield potion. 
---
Happy druiding.
---
No it wasn't.
---
Tips is a straight cokehead. Matter of fact, most of the big streamers are. It’s sad that all it takes to get followers is startup money and enough “energy” to continue talking through a 24 hour play through. And it’s even sadder that players actually listen to a cokehead’s bad advice.
---
You on Mirage horde? Saw a guy adcertiding it prior to this post :)
---
All paladins are alliance.
---
Not all alliance are paladins.
---
The juice box comment got me
---
Nah i am looking for something more friendly, where i click on for example badlands and it shows a list of all possible quest items, like atlas loot
---
Seriously. That area was torture having levelled past it twice.
---
I've seen some in Arathi farming crests.  A mob spawned from a quest and they tagged it without a second thought. It was a 43 elite that didn't drop anything.  Hopefully they died from it but I didn't stick around.
---
On pvp servers you are limited to rolling characters on 1 faction. So you can get all the recipes exclusively acquired by each faction using the booty bay auction house to exchange them. But it's a little risky and i dunno if it's against the rules or not.
---
Play for 15 minutes and Welfare WoW will shower you in epics and gold.  You’ll be back to where you was in no time.  Assuming you’d actually want to play Welfare WoW again.
---
Hey Amelia, fancy meeting you here!
---
It's very strong for a 2h fury warrior.
---
Ganking while they’re fighting mobs at 75% hp. Much skill
---
Barkskin FTW, although you can only use this in caster form. They made it so that you could use barkskin in animal form in TBC, so much better.
---
Not accurate
---
For how long that quest takes and how many times it glitches out, I dont blame them.
---
No they are not. They do fire damage and can only be reduced by fire resist or avoiding the melee entirely. Prior to patch 3.0 elemental damage melee attacks could not be blocked. 
---
My guild kills rag with 2 groups every week in under 2 minutes. Our tanks literally dw fury tank him. There is zero reason to wear a shield vs rag.
---
Not totally sure what you're asking here.  SUF, and all wow addons, are written in Lua.
---
My brother always rolls female human. He’s not weird, creepy or dweeby at all. He just can’t stand the way male humans run. I’m the same way except with Orcs, I think male Orcs look stupid.
---
You are right i know, but those simple tricks tend to drow more attention, just simple marketing.
---
weapon skill is only a really big deal on mobs 3+ levels over you. the emperor is level 59.
---
put a weapon chain on the axe and pull it out whenever you face a pack with a guardsman because they disarm.
---
Yeah, when I tell him I will report him for botting and he doesn't respond while he keeps farming the same spot without moving for 15 minutes straight then he clearly is a well adjusted human being.
---
yeah, the more you resist the knockback, the smoother the run is gonna be.
---
You might want to power through to 35 on that alt and pick up alchemy or leatherworking. Transmutation and refining deeprock salt are both on long cooldowns, so the products of those skills  are worth a pretty penny.
---
For example on Whitemane horde side, rugged hide and deeprock salt are both a few silver each. Grab a salt shaker as a leatherworker and turn those into a cured rugged hide and you just made 30g.
---
On Earthshaker we have 3 made I think and at least one more Eye. We are only a small server!
---
If someone is in a financial situation that they can't afford $15 they probably shouldn't be playing a computer video game.
---
?
---
Taurens have a slightly bigger hitbox, yes. 
---
Due to this they can cast a 40 yard ability at 41.5 yards
---
Unless it is another tauren being targetted, then it is 43. 
---
Female taurens I believe the number is like 1.1yards bonus. 
---
As a taurens in PvP you can easier get hunters in their deadzone while you can melee them thanks to that extra range
---
Go lock if you wanna make friends and not play solo all the time
---
Mark 3 tanks, split raid into 2 groups. Tell melee to fuck off somewhere.
---
Have the 3 tanks stand in i triangle pattern.
---
Whenever Shazz teleport to a group, that group moves to the tank where Shazz previously teleported from as tank it he teleported to takes threat. Rinse and repeat.
---
Hunters don’t scale as well but raids will still want about 3 hunters in Naxx for kiting and trueshot aura. Where hunters truely shine is in PVP
---
Hi man, that's very kind of you! I know this is entirely my fault for not checking properly, I just wasn't prepared for the instasell right after and though I would have some time to cancel it afterwards. I was well aware of how valuable it is, and it would probably have increased my gold by 10x if sold correctly.
---
Gz to you for sniping it so fast I guess haha. I'll whisper you later today.
---
It pisses off horde. What other need is there?
---
You should be using smite as well.  Pull with Holy Fire then mb on cooldown, mixing in smites. You wand at 30% or so.
---
Alright thanks
---
Or just wait for the right buyer, as others have said its bis for entire of classic, someone will pay crazy gold for 1% improvements.
---
As a shaman, I remember I got so many of those
---
This comment thread is pure horde
---
You’re assuming duels among good players, which a vast minority of encounters. Most players are apes, and in a random WPvP encounter, this is definitely not how it’ll play out. For generic pvp among a majority of the playerbase, FAPs are crazy strong and will give warriors a massive edge.
---
Be a druid...
---
Your armor only matters like 10% of the time if you aren't healing :(
---
others do too
---
It's not just $15, it's $15 every month. And it's not that they dont have the money, it's that things are tight enough that they'd rather do something like OP did and put the $15 into bills or savings. It's really simple.
---
You don't have to wonder, I'd guess over 80% female toons are male players.
---
formerly male
---
Ragnaros hits for 600-900 Fire damage per hit, so fire resistance is important but don't sacrafice all your other stats.
---
With my guild we have had a few Ragnaros kills, and we're at 100-150 FR unbuffed, and around 200-225 buffed. There is some pieces that help alot without making you sacrifice other stats.
---
Example:
---
- gyths FR helm from UBRS
---
- Incendious from BRD drops FR bracers
---
- flamelash (not sure if that is his name, but it's the boss after the Barr in BRD) drops a 12 FR cloak. Get a +7 FR enchant on it
---
- chromatic chest has 15 FR while still having a lot of stats as well
---
- onyxia attunement neck has some FR
---
- T1 might set have some pieces with FR
---
- and somewhere FR boots drop as well even though they are mail
---
Beside that you should try to get some dark iron FR gear as well. All dark iron pieces come from reputation with the thorium brotherhood.
---
Bracers are from friendly and easily crafted without requiring too many materials.
---
The leggings are from revered and require significant resources (16 dark iron bars (8ore per bar) and fiery and lava cores). These legs are a piece you want to get as soon as possible.
---
Beside those items you want to farm the +20 FR on head or leg enchant as well. The gyth helm of FR with +20 FR enchant would give you close to 40 FR. Pair this with the dark iron leggings and enchant you can get close to 100 FR from just 2 pieces.
---
That in turn with some other pieces will put you at 150-200 FR unbuffed easily. Your guild should help you get these pieces as it makes the fight significantly easier and farming as a prot warriors is the real deal of #hardlife
---
People in tough situation cannot have entertainment? I know I can be a real dick sometimes ( almost always) but man.
---
This could have been summarised with "they didn't keep the natural progression".
---
It's still true to Vanilla is pretty much every respect, just a specific version of Vanilla. To say it isn't "like Vanilla" is stretching it if you ask me.
---
&gt; I personally think holy shock is trash UNLESS you’re trying to go the shockadin route
---
100% agree, the cooldown and inefficiency means even now that I've got it trained I very rarely use it. It is such a bitch trying to mixmatch gear for it atm that you will not be able to go full plate - or you can but I'm desperately trying to get shock over 1k... I don't think it'll be possible while maintaining over 50% phys mitigation from enough plate.
---
&gt; please don’t think that’s the only way to play a pally
---
Oh god no, it's not even the best way. It's just right now, in p1, you can mixmatch some tanky plate with some +dmg mail/leather and blow people up. I generally play no differently than I did as 30/21/0, but when you are 30/21 and you see a geared mage max range and start a poly or frostbolt cast, you're going to die. With SoC and Shock, you're almost certainly not. Same thing with a rogue, or warrior. Or priest, or shaman. I will qualify that though, with the fact that on my pally's server there are more Horde but they seem overall less organized and not quite as well geared as Ally.
---
&gt; just didn’t think the gear was there yet
---
I mean... if you are the type that can only play the most perfectly optimized whatever then you're right. If you aren't afraid to put a leather or mail +dmg piece on with your plate dress pieces and you have a 2h that goes low and slow... why not? We have 5 hpals in guild core group. We do not need 5 30/21/0 spec'd hpals in our guild's core group.
---
It's hugely gimmicky, revolves around 1 and 2 min cooldowns, and we don't have BWL gear available for the full dress plate +dmg that we should properly have. It also is a massive waste to have every pally in your guild get Sanctuary. I still have Imp BoW in my spec lol. I have a shield and 1h in my bags in case the tank goes down - and I've slapped up RF and thrown a board on and put Concentration up and saved us a run back that way before too, because some tanks don't realize we don't have instant casts and see solid heals and a full mana pool and want you to run away to make you fight the wall boss.
---
My point is purely that if you are part of a good guild, you do not need a pure buffbot spec, and it is a waste to stack it 5-6x in your comp.
---
I think I'm using Peacemaker and a piece of Deathbone and shit like that, half of my pvp gear set is empty at the moment or rather stays the same as my heal gear. I cannot understand why some guilds try to run the exact same spec so much in their comp for paladins.
---
&gt; you bet your ass I’ll be messing around with shockadin builds when I get the gear
---
I mean - this is what prompted it for me. I have one piece of gear left from 5 mans to obtain. We have two other paladins in guild, and I was the third, with Sanctuary. I've topped healing in every single raid I've gone to, while I've watched the other 4 get raid gear and still not pass me. 
---
Give me a reason I shouldn't add some gimmicky burst without losing a single HPS of throughput?
---
RP realms tend to have more World PVP than just PVE realms since there are RP motivations to fight the other side and often guilds are formed specifically for that purpose. I'd recommend a RP PvP if you want a good mixture.
---
Until patch 3.0, elemental damage melee attacks could not be blocked. There's no reason to have armor or wear a shield during the ragnaros encounter. My guild clears him with 2 groups in under 2 minutes every week. Our tanks dw tank him every week.
---
How do u change the font?
---
Earlier today i got stuck on a bucket trying to escape some mobs.
---
He is likely talking about [Patch 1.4](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.4.0) where raid itemization was reworked (previously MC bosses dropped either t1 or t2 set items) and spell damage was redone.
---
&gt; +Spell damage and +Healing effects have been increased in effectiveness to make them more attractive to players. Effects that increased damage and healing done by all magical spells received the largest increase, especially if the previous amount was small. We also fixed a couple bugs relating to these effects.
---
Prior to this change the coefficients on spell damage were really bad.
---
Hunters are amazing at pulling trash, and kiting mobs for various fights in various raids. Hunters are amazing at threat dropping and have 2 cc abilities. Hunters have tranq shot after mc and are needed for nearly every raid enrage after. Hunter’s wolf pet buffs melee and they can drop combat to switch to high utility armor/trinket items mid fight.
---
Is that an addon that let's you see people skill trees?
---
I decided to stop watching after this video. It's not the type of stuff I want to support, ya know? Use your morals.
---
I know that people do tons of 1x stacks to block out the pages, but for some people, we do it because some items have little to no deposit cost.
---
I’ve also found that 6x stacks are usually the next “cost effective” stack method, as they seem to charge less “per item, not stack” for deposit.
---
Thank you! works perfectly.
---
Yeah it’s really cool looking, I just wish it was slower lol
---
Always female character except them horde druids. I never understood that people can pretend being some super wizard summoning demons and what not, but playing as the other gender is just too much!
---
The item I need is a BoP trinket
---
I ran balance in vanilla and had a lot of fun, but i did heal as well so it helps to be flexible
---
I heard next one is for feral dps!
---
I thought LUA was built off SUF? I know some mods are LUA related, but all? I had other mods before LUA?
---
I suppose I don't really understand the details of either mod though.
---
Cries in Taurahe
---
Ur right Naxx was wraith
---
Edgy McEdgerson
---
could they have posted a smaller image FFS
---
also they will likely announce when phase 2 for classic ia launching or a full release schedule 
---
not exactly a mystery
---
I did this too!  Back before they implemented diminishing returns, it was super satisfying.
---
nice screenshot! very cinematic too
---
:-)
---
Ye having a lot of fun w/ my lock, got like 5-6k+ health buffed in pvp gear atm. I just watch most mana classes go oom on me then I kill
---
Sounds like you're channeling LSP from adventure time. 
---
"Why don't those starving poor people just get food and money from their parents?"
---
And once you have proper gear, there comes elemental mage. 
---
Always amazing to see two well supported mages shred an enemy zerg in WSG mid.
---
Making the blood elves a bit more, I don't know "tribal punk"(?) could've been a great way for Horde players to accept them. Messier hair, tribal tattoos, letting them be shamans maybe. They could've explained it in the lore with maybe Elemental magic soothing their arcane magic addiction.  
---
Then "Blood knights" could've been former paladins converting to worshipping the elements instead of the Light.
---
That’s how I got my blood razor :)
---
120g on AH the guy put it up for 10g :)
---
From what I’ve seen, it’s still possible but the rewards are greatly reduced compared to what people expected because of private servers.
---
I’m also 99% sure that video was a troll/parody, as your chances of getting epics are nowhere near what they claim or actually receive.
---
A "computer video game"... What are you.. 60 years old?
---
Sounds unplayable to me i’d uninstall if i were you
---
Dps/heals etc
---
Those vulnerability bonuses could be *huge*, since they were a percentage multiplier (25, 50 percent, etc.) rather than a flat increase. Add that on top of improved shadow bolt, and Warlocks could be capable of some pretty impressive (though admittedly unpredictable) burst dps. Since I played the class myself, I was pretty unhappy to see it go; though I can understand why they did it.

---
I mean, if you're too poor to have $15 a month then yeah, you should prob not be having much fun and should be looking for a job. Even a McDonald's worker can pay that shit, get out of here
---
thats why fire is for pve and not pvp i said
---
Makes perfect sense as an Undead player is considered Humanoid.
---
Well they could have created counterparts in each faction to increase the diversity and balance drops. The counterparts can still play different but to balance the gear drops.
---
would be impressive if you didn't play mage
---
Because all your hard work from gearing paid off, and when you compete with others with same gear, it becomes more fun through the extremely small stuff that can make a difference (such as when you use PoM or AP).
---
Plenty of good F2P games out there.
---
Works for the rest of us
---
When you use "feed pet," let the buff fall off before doing anything with him.
---
I am a hairy shorter male playing a male dwarf. 
---
Though I imagine true to gender demographics vary to a significant degree based on server type and faction.
---
Upvoted for “filthy dwarf” but had to retract it for “beautiful Night Elf.”
---
For the Horde!
---
why
---
Doing exactly what you are doing on my druid. I run low level dungeons for boe greens and blues. Also started an mage alt to get tailoring so i can send cloth i find in the dungeons to craft green items i can send back to my druid and disenchant.
---
Excuse me but we're having a circlejerk here
---
I had at the start, using lvl 45 Water at Lvl 55+ got really annoying tho, thank god fro DM Water!
---
The ludicrous *size* of pauldrons in WoW is my biggest aesthetic gripe with the game, and if there was an option to hide them a la cape/helm I would have that checked 100% of the time. As it stands, playing a female character is the best way to keep them from getting into "50% person, 50% shoulder" territory.
---
That's it. I'm changing mine to Lucinda Bold.
---
Top bants!
---
Thats highly unlikely , just saying.
---
I’ve done 5 weeks of MC as a rogue, gotten one piece of loot. I’ve seen maybe 10 drop total.
---
One way would be to create counterparts in each faction a mail int user for ally and one plate int for horde. 
---
But honestly if ally
---
Gets shaman drops and horde gets pally drops I would say that is balanced. The same amount of bad rolls
---
That makes sense at least unike "strat live" lol
---
found the RL. keep us posted
---
; however,
---
It's crazy how many fast 2h weapons are in the game. Sorta sucks how talent mechanics go against the weapon designs. I found it fascinating in TBC just how much better everything was itemized - like in Vanilla there are so many slower tanking weapons, even Furor's sword is too damned slow and it's 'iconic', then in TBC they're mostly all 1.6.
---
DME Warlock is best GPH right now with mining/herb, though engi makes it easier. Its a difficult farm as well. Mage is probably the easiest of the farms you listed, skinning herb for DMN + DME
---
This shit made me laugh out loud hahaha wp
---
Resto druid is king of WSG. If you have the PvP set (blue 4 or purple 3) with speed enchanted boots you can run with +63% movement speed outdoors with travel form. That + clear roots and slows with every shapeshift + hots + nature’s swiftness (3min cd next heal is instant) + swiftmend (15cd, consume hot effects and heal instantly for a big chunk) and the ability to go bear when taking heavy damage... yup, that’s a kitty that has nine lives.
---
&gt; and it depends a lot on your healers.
---
&gt; spends 3 paragraphs talking about gear
---
Man if i could tell you all the stuff i did, it wouldnt be unlikely, tbh its much higher that i said just not all liquid. Ill probably get downvoted but oh well!
---
bet you feel real fucking badass when you and 20 other guildies are killing 1 guy lol. 
---
that guy killed you 1v1, don't roll pvp if you cant handle it
---
You're an idiot
---
Cannot relate at all. Kept the same pet from lvl 8 all the way to 60 and it never went below lvl 6 loyalty.
---
Those green name really turns me off lol...  try to enter this in the in-game chat. Trust me it will be much easier for your life :D 
---
 /console SET chatClassColorOverride "0" -- turn on class colours
---
Well it wouldn’t be a PVP server if there weren’t butt buddy horde groups piling any Alliance they see
---
Dodged a bullet there
---
Put your twinks on a second account so you can ghost grind Timbermaw rep!
---
Hmmm, interesting.
---
Imaging being such a salty little bitch
---
Bwl also has a lot of fire resist mobs so you dont end up going fire until aq40 is out and bwl is on complete farm status.
---
Is it actually not good then?
---
It’s like the WoW version of a niceguy
---
Stop being such a hater dude, some people play differently then you. For example in my guild we give gear to people who play well, in this guild they give HoR to whoever can ERP the sexiest nelf. And there's nothing wrong with that.
---
What Rank Frostbolt do you use you use in Raids (in addition to Max Rank) to stop going OOM if there's no way to get more Mana due to CDs?
---
Hunters have exclusively (weapon dmg + added bonus dmg) weapon dmg abilities, only multi-shot rank is improved from AQ and we have 3 weapons that we get after we hit 60. 
---
Buffs that should give us ap does not and buffs that do suck. That's one of the many reasons hunters fall off. 
---
Play the class you enjoy though, no one cares about how bad a class is as long as you're not the worst of the same class in your guild.
---
I am logging for today I think so let's talk tomorrow!  
---
Just so you know there's a lot of snipers on our server so you probably don't even have 2 seconds if you fuck up :P
---
Do I have to run and find the school of fishes or is it just possible to for me to watch and click on the bobber nonstop?
---
He can dps, heal, tank and even conjure water + soulstones. OP you missed out
---
Are you mounted? If yes, then that's it, the hand doesn't change while you are mounted
---
just realized im using AH boar meat that is likely from elywnn forest
---
Just curious: Do you mean lvl 60 dungeons? I felt like the very first dungeon that I was sucking dry the healers mana was sunken temple. Mage was at 50% mana, melee DPS were ready to go, warlock life tapped to 50 mana, ate for 10 seconds and was ready to go... healer was at 10% mana. 
---
All dungeons before that were easily done with a 2hander except some mobs like Ghazrilla.
---
You have to feed him food close to his level, the level of food boosts the happiness 
---
Lvl25 food = 25 happiness per tick
---
Lvl 30 food = 30 happiness per tick
---
Right, and I would hope you side with the guildie in that scenario.
---
Haha omg love this stuff. Keep it up!
---
gquit
---
Thank you for reminding me of this...
---
Eskanders is super for tanking!
---
Not a keybind in sight LOL
---
He hits for physical though, not fire damage.
---
Looks like comic sans on the action bar to me
---
That’s not enough. I need to actually farm runecloth. But I appreciate your input!
---
You totally miss the point. I was not complaining at all.
---
Being routinely ganked by groups of players is nothing unusual on a pvp server. At other times there are wordless agreements to just mind your own business. At the end of the day people will remember your actions.
---
So if you exspecially go out of your way to act like a twat (like ganking someone in the middle of doing the benediction quest) then you probably deserve being ganked and camped.
---
If you think he "killed me 1v1" then google the benediction quest for yourself.
---
You're... Really mad aren't you :( I'm sorry, hope your day gets better, friend.
---
You also need to feed your pet until the face goes green.  Yellow is only middle.

I think BC is the best of Vanilla and changes without ruining game feel. 
---
The item design is vanilla had me scratching my head.
---
Have you tried going onto wowhead? Any humanoids/undead in end game zones drop runecloth. World drop BoE Epics and Rares drop off of all mobs, some with different loot pools some with different drop rates. The drop rate difference is splitting hairs. 
---
When asking questions like this you should include your class/spec/race/faction/pvp or pve server and you will get a much better answer. Mages farm faster than rogues, for example. If runecloth isn't expensive on your server, you should consider farming more valuable mats with your time, selling those for gold, and then buying runecloth.
---
You're a straight shooter and I like it
---
There’s a sick command that actually lets you leave the chat that is made of trading. It’s /leave trade. You should try it
---
I havnt had a single issue with my pet. Been 6 since i first got him there after taming him. Are you giving it low level food? Are you dismissing it alot?
---
Ragnaros does both fire and physical damage
---
Why does warrior have that complicated instances .berserk. prot. Arms. Cant be that simple as a rogue or a mage can be
---
No, not good for a 2h for a warrior.
---
What an outlook, bud. Very decent of you. You seem to look as people as being a 'McDonalds worker' and judge worthiness based off their paycheck. Like there isn't a chance those 'workers' somehow can't put in 16 hours a day feeding your pretentious ass and STILL have to find some way to pay 'just 15 a month.' But they shouldn't be able to put on virtual gear and smack mobs alongside you. You work harder than them. 15 is nothing to you. And they don't rate being able to play a game. Very prick comment by a very pompous clown.
---
If PvP is a priority, mining and engineering it is.  It's pretty hard making good money with engineering, but the later ore like mithril and thorium sell really well on AH.  Arcane crystals, which drop randomly out of thorium veins every now and then, sell for 45-50g a piece on my server.
---
OwO that’s a big damage meter
---
Nah bruh. You either heal OR you dps. This aint retail.
---
He wasnt even responding to your comment. 
---
Dude your Sarah McChlachlan commercial of an emotionally charged excuse for an argument just makes you sound incompetent. 
---
Ill help you with the math because it really is cut and dry. Take the hundreds of hours this dude (who i promise you is neither a starving kid in africa nor does he need to be a millionaire to afford fucking wow rofl) sinks into wow, subtract less than 2 of those hours, add those less than 2 fucking hours to any minimum wage equivalent job, pay the 15 dollars.
---
HURRR DURRRR HES POOR WHAT IS HE SUPPOSED TO DO. Stfu
---
for min/maxers it's worth it.
---
for the average person, it's up to them. essentially robes will last you until ZG and that's ages away so you'll get your money by using them.
---
That works or you can just use one tank and have the person who gets teleported to just run to the tank.
---
Ahahahahahahaha good one. You got me
---
Besides you are fucking wrong, imagine beeing so stupid to not fact check before claiming im wrong hahahahah:

Comic Sans was made specifically to be easy to read, so I'm not surprised.
---
Thank you :)
---
I bet Van'Cleef didn't get paid for this either.
---
Alchemy transmutes are always in demand.  But you need the alts to be 35.
---
Ah cool, thanks man. I'm not 60 yet so haven't tried any of this out yet. So you go in and pickpocket as many mobs as possible, go to vault and kill a couple bosses?
---
Oya! Hahaha! Dis be a fine showcase of who we be mon!
---
I like watching Kevin Jordan streams. Chill leveling and talking about developing the game. Really enjoy the dual streams he has with some of the quest designers.
---
Not a warrior but around BRD I full sent into bear mode. Before then I was doing just fine as cat spec BRD turns up the heat a bit and I found it was necessary then.
---
&gt;It doesn't take into account sheer zerging power as much as it does who is switching targets quickly, maximizing uptime, not going AFK or whatever else.
---
Which means it is completely useless for analyzing class effectiveness. And its not even that good for personal player analysis because it doesn't take into account non-damage roles people do, like summoning, passing out food/water or consumables, marking up targets for trash and bosses, summoning people, and other administrative stuff like loot and shit.
---
&gt;When we parsed in FFXI and older games we always looked at the overall encounter
---
I'm not sure if you are misunderstanding or if encounter has a different meaning here, but I'm specifically talking about only looking at damage per boss fight, instead of damage for the whole 2 hour raid.
---
get to a higher level dude why would you try to farm at level 12...
---
You are better off just farming whatever you can for the highest g/hour and buy it
---
We did not come back.  We went on to Undercity after the AH.  We do not speak of the Undercity raid...
---
because theyre undead
---
oooh that night elf bath water!!
---
Genuinely
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=14047 in the “dropped by” tab prioritize highest drop rate to show at the top and then work your way down until you find a nice balance of drop rate/kill speed/density that’s not being
---
competitively farmed (this is a part of virtually every farm where you need to make a decision for yourself). Don’t think these drop rates consider the chance for “no drop” so they’re not 100% accurate but it gives you a reference for comparing one mob to another
---
I wonder. Our old CTO (a dude in his like 70s, with a college degree in comp sci) sent ALL his emails in comic sans. Maybe this was why
---
You need 420 stacks I believe, save your self some time and farm stuff to sell for gold, then make a thing for /trade chat saying you are buying all runecloth
---
Today, 1/1, yday, no clue what that is :p
---
Why is this upvoted? It has nothing to do with OPs question? Lol saw DM:E Lasher farm and touted off the only thing everyone is echoing
---
My friend tanked scholomance last night pretty easily with mostly rare quality feral gear last night.  He doesn't have wardens staff, he had some mace...  like nothing real fancy and he did just fine.
---
All hunter helmets look awful except for t3
---
I would recommend going feral to level, just collect some into gear when healing is needed. The spec won’t matter so much until 50+.
---
When I feel lost at a certain level, I travel to a zone with unfinished quests.
---
I’ve never done any kind of transmutes like that. Can you explain a little bit on how I can make money with that on a level 35 alt if you don’t mind.
---
Nah. That's not nearly enough damage to warrant needlessly wasting GCD time being inside the 5sr. Mana and regen are key in leveling.
---
Depending on if you have Shadowform (Holy Fire), MB, SWP - strafe sideways while GCD refreshes - then MindFlay or Wand depending on crits. Most times it makes the most mana-sense to only use Instant Casts are the tail end of a casted spell in order to maximize your 5sr regen. Makes for good practice for healing, ie: a G.Heal followed by a Renew, etc.
---
Keep in mind that if they were considered undead, then they would be immune to fear, charm etc. effects. It would be quite op imo.
---
As a mage who is doing this right now I can tell you the best are probably the Ogres SE of Karazhan. But this is inefficient. The best way to get the runecloth is to farm gold and buy it all. The ogres will give you 7-8 stacks/h that's like 10-15g worth, if you can farm more g per h just buy it all.
---
Lastly, if you really insist on farming it, I'd suggest farming certain mobs in EPL and WPL as they give you Argent Dawn rep and runecloth.
---
Good advice here
---
I’m an undead rogue in a PvP server
---
My strictly anecdotal experience bears this out. Locks are easier to kill. Not easy, but easier.
---
Here's the strategy:  Pick up all the herbs you see.  If that's too much for you, then maybe professions aren't for you.
---
Hope you look at it every now and then to check on things!
---
420 stacks is only from Revered to Exalted, in reality it's more like 800 stacks.
---
You're right that having good gear makes a big difference. This is another reason why leveling warriors are "hard".  My 2H, 1H, and shield have easily gotten 10+ levels outdated by leveling naturally and running every dungeon a couple times without finding any upgrades. To feel powerful, warriors have to actively hunt specific drops from specific dungeons/quests, or make it a point to stop at the AH every few levels and spend some gold on upgrades.
---
Im lv 55 on my rogue right now can I farm any dungeons or get into groups for lbrs, ubrs, brd, scholo, dire maul any of the high end dungeons or should I wait till like lv57 or 58 or 60
---
Is there any detailed server demographic data out there that isn't poll based and is at least somewhat updated? A google search just got some outdated/lackluster info and a sea of articles titled things like "HOW TO PICK *YOUR* WOW CLASSIC SERVER!"
---
I mean, you are mounted running looking for pools, dismount and fish 5 times and repeat.. you miss alot of Netflix when actually netflixing 😔
---
rank 1 if you’re spec’d Winters Chill til you’re 5 stacks. Max rank otherwise, you should have plenty of mana (buffs, good buffs, evo+mana gems, mana pots) 
---
I have about 50 FR with mage armor. Make sure you’re bringing fire protection pots (greater and lesser) and use your fire ward on CD! Save your healer some mana!
---
Thank you very much!
---
Zelda: Ocarina of Time is one of my favorite games of all time.  In addition to the wonderful rush of nostalgia I get when playing it, it's also a very well made game that holds up to this day.  When I decide one day that I want to give it another play through, I'm not hoping for  a remix or a changed experience.  I just want to play the game I know and love.
---
The same goes for WoW.
---
&gt; A massive instance like BRD, itself an experience where you're supposed to explore and enjoy, instead being either cleared by AoE groups or groups specifically running to only a few bosses and who will flame you when you go the wrong way as its ruining their XP/M?
---
Literally last night I did BRD with IRL friends.  It took us several hours but we full cleared it with some level 52 and 53s in the party an had an absolute blast.
---
I'm currently level 30 Tauren Druid, I have completed the quests in Thousand Needles (including all the Shimmering Flats ones with a buddy). I've traveled to Desolace and Stranglethorn Vale and am feeling underlevelled (reckon I could do with another level or 2 before continuing quests there). Anyone got any tips on where to go or what to do for the next 2 levels? Thanks!
---
cata was released in 1998.  
---
tfw BC was 30 years ago. 
---
and we had to walk uphill both ways too!
---
did you explain the situation to the raidleaders? i cant imagine everyone would decline you after knowing someone literally cant hear?
---
another guy that doesnt understand what makes this game good.
---
I would buy that tbh
---
.. and if you can get me some used cloth pieces, preferably from female night elf priests, i would pay a stately sized sum..
---
The main reason tanks want FR for rag is 1) to avoid getting knocked back and 2) the random fire damage from events. This prevents lot of random damage
---
run speed enchant!!!!
---
800 stacks seriously? I’ll never get that much runecloth! Daaaamn
---
Posting cuz i only have one upvote to have. Pro changers can eat me
---
How is it hard for people to just spam click between track herbs/nodes? Y’all make it sound like it’s impossible when those profs have made me so much money in Classic so far lmao
---
My guild has decided they are going to do loot council which I simply don't want a part of (This is with me on the council). 
---
I'm going to go and look out for a DKP guild but I've got a few questions : 
---
1. How badly is DKP hoarding frowned upon? I play a feral druid meaning there is literally only 2 upgrades in MC, all with low drop rates, so I'm probably just going to not take any items until they drop.
---
2. Does dkp usually reset or something when a tier comes out?
---
I actually hate this change ngl. I hate it on retail and I hate it in Classic. It’s causes so many problems. I don’t know why they ever made this a thing.
---
PSA: USE FIRE WARD AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE 
---
don’t over look this great ability!!!!
---
A buff or nerf that seems *fresh* to you may (and will) seem stupid to someone else. There is no solution that will make everyone happy.
---
*#nochanges* is an absolute, objective term. And this is what this whole endeavor was about in the first place.
---
What’s the name of the crafted set?
---
NOCHANGES
---
There used to be a handful of sites yes but they relied on the in-game Census app. Blizzard ‘broke’ that app with an update in mid September, so the sites that rely on that add-on have been obsolete for over a month.
---
I’ve seen some people mention new sites with new methods that get server demographic information but no one has linked me them before.... so if anyone knows of those new sites NOT using the old Census add-on data id love to see them!
---
1 this afternoon
---
2 none, but I'm only lvl52 rightnow so that's irrelevant
---
3 about 2 weeks ago when I was going around Arathi herbing.
---
4 no, but does it matter? It's going to wind up on the AH. So go get some money and get it there.
---
I want to play WoW the way was when it was still good. Like Classic is now.
---
Opening up to 1 change means that there are other changes coming in the future. I don't want that. I want WoW not the corpse that retail has become with all its QoL and "player immersion" Bullshit.
---
You want QoL there is a terrific game out there for you. It's called retail.
---
YOU...
---
YOU NO DIE...LOVE U
---
Because yoy have an entire year to use the robe before zg is out
---
&gt;I can bring you back from the dead but I can also turn your brain into pudding. What's not to love?
---
You not healing before they die.
---
Most specs doesn't matter ss long as you know what your class is good at. Ignore your healing spells as a priest, and you should be shunned.
---
Not saying you need to respec, just saying - play to your class' strengths, not weaknesses.
---
You're not wrong, it seems like the shittiest people make it to the top.
---
The novelty of WoW Classic is exactly the fact that it's the same game as it used to be. Messing with that would ruin it, and it wouldn't be classic anymore. Honestly, if you want the things you suggest, why not play BFA? I don't mean that in a demeaning way. It seems exactly like what you want.
---
Just have them log into the discord and sit in the chat lobby.  There’s almost no way they’ll think you’re deaf if you type I don’t have a mic.  
---
Sucks that it isn’t easy for someone with a disability to raid, but it’s easier to just not tell your guild/pug raid
---
was like 281k on my last purcahse
---
I’d just sell stuff now. Need the gold now on my end, and If everyone is hoarding AH rares for next phases, I could see how prices could potentially drop with market flood from all the hoarders
---
I found the best way for me to fight back against the system is just play the game how I want to play. I dont care about what anyone else is doing. I don't care about optimizing everything. I play my way on my terms regardless of what is best. I have been playing since launch and I'm not 60. I have alts and I play slowly. That's the classic I wanted. The idea that classic is vanilla was never true and it never will be. If you look at classic more as a new game not comparing it apples to apples to vanilla than I think you will end up with a more enjoyable experience. For comparison to bfa I made the same toons and played them for a couple hours and I was blasting through. I just dont understand why everyone compares classic to vanilla or bfa. Classic and its goal should not be min maxing or rushing to 60. I wish more people would just slow down and take the time to enjoy the journey but I am a strong believer in play how you want. 
---
I'm sure my ranty ramble is confusing and makes no sense but I said it anyway lol. I hope everyone just plays what they want and how they want.
---
Appreciate the feedback, good point.
---
Was this pertento guild previously on k3?
---
Moonkins got turned into Oomkins cause they were OOM 24/7. Then when they started to become viable later on in WoW's lifetime they trended towards Boomkins because of the big Starfire crits. And then you got the fanatics that try to call it Doomkins instead.
---
In naxx that was definetly not true.
---
Ive been combining coffer runs with doing pickpocketing in arena and bar, as well as killing loregrain and plugger. This method brings me 30-60g/h depending on rng (pp resists, drops, aggros leading to death). 
---
I’ve been buying relic coffer keys from AH for 20-30s and I think it’s still the grays, gem-, and large coin sacks makes it still viable.  Vault chests can still drop some good shit, e.g. Traveller’s backpack
---
Hey , yes we explained everything in both of these situations and we got declined from the guild and in the pug we just got kicked.
---
I'm not blaming them ( they just want to clear the stuff ... ), i  just think its just unfair cuz he is my best buddy &gt;.&lt;! and it sucks that he cant enjoy the game as every1 else....
---
I play shadow priest and ele sham as my “mains” so I guess my 3rd alt should be a balance druid to fulfill the trio of classes that are awful in raids but great in PvP.
---
Just join the discord? No need to say shit only the leaders should be talking anyway.
---
How do you see lower ranked spells?
---
Assuming you have salv already I don’t think that’s possible.  Your tanks need to generate more threat if you wanna get top parses.  They are your bottleneck, it’s not you.
---
Your pug situation doesnt make a lot of sense. Why doesnt he join dicord? Even if he is not listening. I join discord for pugs but no one ever knows if im death or not. They dont ask everyone individually if they are listening. If he knows tactics then just join dicord and pretend to be hearing.
---
Hey dude I just want to say I've been seeing your comics for a long time and I think you're absolutely hilarious.
---
And a gifted artist too.  I've watched your style get better and more defined in a very short time and I'm downright impressed &lt;3
---
This is an excellent point. I'm going to go deep frost until 60 to pick up those additional points in frost channeling and arctic reach.
---
Bosses won't go down that fast forever. If anything you'll see more of them in PvP, although even there it's better to just go with 30/0/21 or a caster tri-spec.
---
I have both. Is that the best alternative? I’ve been using Barman Shanker in MH though and I’m torn on which is better
---
You're going to be able to find a guild who's cool with it.  You just need to keep looking.  Just be up front and talk with the GM about it and move on if they're jerks.  Your friend probably won't be able to go along with the harder raids like AQ40 or Naxx, but for sure MC and ZG/AQ20.  
---
About your title to the post though "It's impossible for deaf person to find a group..."  I didn't see your original post but finding a GROUP is a completely different thing than being included in a raid.   I haven't spoken a single word to another player in Classic yet, and I am able to join and build groups with regularity.  Grouping doesn't require voice comms at all.
---
Are you eu? Last I checked NA is 140k
---
So he decides to virtually buy game time for free instead of paying IRL currency for it?
---
Honestly, it is just a smart move. Does that mean he cant afford the actual price tag? No.
---
Seems like you are just self-projecting your own situation on OP. Like most insults and personal attacks on internet.
---
Just join discord and "listen" lol if they have such a hard-on for seeing a name in the app appease them there's no reason to explain anything if your typing to your friend ur good over explaining to folks who will only hold it against u is pointless.
---
\#nochanges for original content. MMO's are so rarely preserved.
---
However I'm down for classic+ where we get modules of additional content. No leveling, no additional gear ilevels, just new more difficult encounters that offer alternatively itemized gear to shake up all the metas and offering additional cosmetic options.
---
Yes, it’s the difference between full dmg hits vs glancing dmg hits. You want 9% hit. Your racial counts as 3% of that, freeing you up to put other stats on your gear
---
I got a bunch of charms so I'll still try and sell those. I also got a bunch of other greys that Auctioneer is telling me to vendor but TSM is showing data that ppl buy them on my server...can't quite remember the name but I thought it was just trash. Any idea what they are? I'll have to check the AH later when I get on today
---
&gt; But as an example, when I killed Rag in 2005, our raid used to have  every single melee get knocked back every 10 seconds or so, swim back  through the lava and start attacking again throughout the entire fight.  Nobody stopped to think "gosh, we should just range this before it  happens each time."  In classic, we all step back 5 yards then back into  melee and never get knocked back. 
---
Basically this.... People got a lot better at raiding in the meantime. And by a lot, I really mean A LOT. I remember at 4H back in Vanilla Naxx I always argued for rotating the tanks in and out, but for some reason, people refused to do so for at least 3 weeks....
---
Close enough. 1.13 was the pre-tbc patch, 1.12 was the final true vanilla patch.
---
#nochanges
---
It was always like this
---
I would do this in tanaris near the coast.
---
You sick fuck
---
Like the guy said, friend doesn't need to talk, just listen. So join discord and have him 'listen.' If they ask a specific question write to buddy to answer. If it takes a time make up a lie he's afk for a sec
---
jUsT aSk Ur MoM FoR sUm MoNEy!
---
I think you got some good replies, but the reality is that the mage rhythm is pew-pew with downtime for drinking. If you're looking for more of a consistent leveling playstyle I'd look at warlocks, since they have great tools for managing their resources between pulls in addition to strong survivability.
---
5+ hours for all 4 scarlet monastery dungeons? Lmao no way. Armory is the longest and takes maybe 30 minutes
---
Practically the shaman national anthem at this point, first pvp video I ever saw and i loved it. Can’t hear that song without thinking about wind fury.
---
Ill hijack this post and ask also: is it possible to farm it as a holy paladin using only consencration/ret aura?
---
You need to just buy it from the ah
---
Well then farming just about anything is going to be a crawl, I would run dungeons and take your chances with BoEs that drop, sell them, buy the cloth you need. It's going to take you forever to loot that much runecloth killing 1 mob at a time, 2 when bf is off CD.
---
And when youve got a bunch of items you're not using in retail, then classic is f2p as well, for a month.
---
“Keep the meta fresh.” In Vanilla I grinded out Grand Marshal on Warsong server. I raided with the best guild there then transferred to another server and raided with some of the best guilds in the world. I’ve done literally everything in this game, including had a few world top 5 kills in BWL/Naxx. I know the content in and out, and memorized most of it by 2006.
---
All this to say, it’s still fresh as fuck to me, and I’ve dumped days into it thus far reliving all the fun stuff I did 15 years ago. If you don’t like it because it’s not like retail, then leave. You don’t get to have your instant gratification in Classic. If you think it wasn’t theorycrafted in Beta go watch Indalamar’s Fury Warrior DPS video on YT. He singlehandedly got Fury nerfed before Vanilla went live and it was so bad they had to readjust for several months to make it viable again. All the things you see now we’re there early on in Vanilla, but the social media and streamer bullshit was less prevalent which in turn made all the theorycrafting less visible.
---
Deadly boss mods gives an audio and visual alert for most raid encounter mechanics. If your friend can play and read words that flash on the middle of the screen then that will cover a lot of what goes on in discoed. There’s going to be situations of course where making discord calls comes in to play but situational awareness and knowing boss fights will get him by. 
---
Every fight is written out in detail on what to do for each role and class. It’s going to take a willingness to be great but he could totally do it and be *better* than other raiders who can listen.
---
No. flame strike breaks nova and CoC slow isnt enough to get 2 blizzs off. 
---
Arcane Concentration is CLUTCH for if you dont have endless mana. Like if you're lvling and not in BIS
---
The elementium ore mostly
---
just have them zerg it and die, much faster that way
---
Cause the alliance never do this.
---
I’d take you in our raid if you’re ally on Incendius.
---
It’s 3% for the species base modifier. I guess the fact that Cats attack much faster and the talents literally benefit greatly from attack speed (considering raw crit and Frenzy) has no effect on the effective damage output of your pet? I guess having “slightly more” damage doesn’t impact your pets threat generation either? Cat is literally bae right now.
---
Holy shit what a fucking tool
---
Yes, you cant block elemental attacks. However you can block ragnaros.
---
Put 2 and 2 together will you.
---
Also gj on killing him under 2 minutes, all that means is you have a few dps players awake. That unfortunately means your in the high 1minute probably , meaning you don't need dwfury either.
---
Yeah there isn’t “rampant botting” going on. Blizzard has pretty much broke botting in the traditional sense with the spyware they are running while the launcher is open. 
---
There are a couple things that you could be observing though, hunter parks his toon on top of a known spawn point of a mob, has a autoclicker pressing the number one key that fires off a arcane shot then autoattacks while it has a target. Underhanded yes, botting no. 
---
If you have more than one pc it is also possible to run Warcraft on one pc, use screen sharing software and run the autoclicker on the 2nd pc so blizzards spyware never sees the autoclicker.
---
so my route is:
---
* go through the 2 Shadowforge gates
---
* go through the east garrison door 
---
* go up to the arena, pick pocket all the mobs on one site
---
* go down and kill Pyromancer (he is kinda gear depended need at least some pre-bis gear)
---
* go up to the arena again and pick pocket all the mobs on the other side of the arena 
---
* make your way to the grim guzzler and pick pocket all the mobs on the way
---
* kill Plugger spazzering 
---
* make your way to the relic coffer room and pick pocket mobs on the way 
---
* Loot 11 boxes (there are 12, but the last one is kinda hard to get and is not worth it if you die, so i skip it)
---
* run out and reset
---
Im a lower level and new to the game (17 N.Elf druid) so I doubt I could help you out much but ive got no issue teaming up with you guys, now or in the future (when my level is higher and I can contribute more). Hope your luck finding groups gets better! Seems like you've only ran into jerks so far tbh. I get that people want to be able to communicate but if your friend knows what to do there's no reason he should be excluded.
---
you are the rogue version of me then :P
---
thanks?..
---
Where do you think meatballs come from?
---
It looks exactly like this on my screen. Problem with playing in 1080p. If you scale the UI smaller you can't see shit.
---
Until you want artifact power
---
Sure you do. You probably also had Naxx on farm and the entire guild is ex rank 14s
---
Blackrock Stronghold in Burning Steppes is better for rogue. There's 4 chest spawns and Thorium nodes nearby
---
I do that. However in green leveling gear I did not feel like I was contributing much to the group effort anyways in dungeons like Stratholme Undead, therefore I just kept the shield on.
---
However from your post I conclude you mostly played with healer friends which takes a lot of pressure of the tank.
---
Having pugged my way to preBiS fury gear as tank, it's far easier to pick up the slack of bad healers and DPS in pug groups.
---
I see you like to live dangerously.
---
I will take being able to MC undead players off cliffs/chains/etc over being able to shackle them.
---
Hey , yeah we just wanted to be honest with them and explain the situation , its not like we couldnt lie to those people :X 
---
With this post i just want to reach to people and tell them that in this game theres people that are disabled too , and we just have to give a little of us to understand them. It's not that hard, we dont have to look down on them like its their fault or something.
---
I don't know if we should make fun of easy PVE content in other games...
---
I'm the one saying go ahead and play wow, even if you're poor. I also called you out for saying "computer video game".
---
Pepare to diea a lot
---
We gave one to a warlock just in cast blizzard ever decides to open it up for all classes.
---
You can prob sell for 300-325 yet. I got rid of mind for 250 which was prob low, but dire maul release screwed me on my server. Average price now I'm saying is 275-325. I'm sure you could hold out for "that guy" who will spend 450 for a small increase.
---
it's brilliant! need more videos!
---
If you work at McDonald's you don't have skills to make more money. If you do and you still work there you are just lazy. That doesn't even hit on the fact you aren't getting what I said. I said, EVEN McDonald's workers can afford that small fee if you can't you are prob a child or unemployed, ie stop playing wow and go get a job
---
True il probably pop it on for 300g tomorrow

Healing touch is your main spell dude.

Spending money on a computer, internet, and a monthly fee when you're poor... Seems like a great idea lmao.
---
Fishing question here. On alliance can i get to 425 fishing with buffs before the stv fishing tournament is out? Im +3 short of 425.
---
Hillsbrad?

That's racist.

Mats are like 30-35on my server and the transmute sells 40-46g maybe ive just been getting lucky

Chasing a druid into the water. lol
---
Hai :) Thank you for commenting.
---
I just wanted to reach to people with this post and tell them that theres a lot of people that are disabled and playing this game. Nobody is perfect and we just need to understand them just a little and not to look down on them and act like its their fault... c:
---
You actually can help me a lot , just if you see a disabled person in-game just dont ignore him or kick him out of your future groups c: Thank you once again &lt;3
---
shadowmeld doesnt work like it works in more recent versions...it doesnt break combat, and cant be used in combat.
---
I have my other locks put up elements, restlessness and two corruptions. I put weakness on the X, then wait for 3 sunders on skull to put up curse of shadow, then start shadow bolt spams.  It helps prevent back to back shadow bolt crits from pulling aggro.
---
For fun.
---
Not to mention the AH bots. That shit is crazy.
---
Scarlet monastery has some great gear and xp, since ur a druid u could fill what roles the party needs to speed up the queueing up process too
---
Role filling starts to be less viable at 52+ dungeons so i would look into respecing into resto/tank around then
---
Go Prot at 53 and live in BRD
---
That's kinda obvious, since it's alliance.
---
You, uh, need a nap?
---
How come you're the only person wearing it?
---
Tanks have Quel sword and shied
---
The other is a druid in full BiS gear
---
It's far better to have it on two different buttons, in case you lag.  
---
but this is the best I have so far for this:  
---
/petattack [@pettarget, noexists]  
---
/petfollow [@pettarget, exists]
---
Alright it’s obvious you’re trolling so now so just fuck off, please?
---
It doesn't though. We make fun of it. Also, mission accomplished.
---
Yep.  True vanilla when 99% of all of us were noobs.
---
Low level crafting materials don't sell well and they're mostly a waste of time.  Most people (at the beginning at least) just vendored them.  You can't really make any decent gold before about level 35 when artisan craftsmanship opens up.
---
Yeah, as far as I remember when you get the money  you just hand-in the quest. That's how it was done in the old days at least. I just wanted to know if it's still a thing with servers being this young.
---
People can be so shitty... If you're on H-Kirtonos send me a PM!
---
Dude you just suck as a person. Go outside
---
well, i'm on 9% and i just started the quest to get the Ommoks Girth waist for crit instead of the Brigam Girdle which has hit. I was trying to replace hit items for crit, so u think i should keep my current hit %?
---
Oh yeah you right. My bad. Good to see theres at least one rational and responsible adult here
---
If you aren't logged in on both accounts having one on follow doing only what's necessary to complete the quests, I'd say do that
---
I would stick to brd and lbrs till 58, theres plenty of preraid bis to be grinded out from those 2 until u reach a good lvl for the higher lvl ones
---
Chromaggus EU?
---
Hai :) Thank you for your comment,
---
We are in realm Faerlina and Atiesh .. US ... 
---
I just wanted to reach to as many people as possible with this post and tell them to give a little bit of them and their time to understand the disabled people , Theres a lot of disabled people that are playing WoW it takes a little of us to make them happy. IF you have a disabled person in your guild just give him a chance!!
---
I feel the same about gnome rogues. I would argue their racial is way better for classic pvp with mages being so relevant.
---
Not sure where that is coming from, but let it all out I guess. You keep complaining about other people "ruining" this game for you, maybe take a step back and understand people are allowed to have opinions you disagree with and they shouldn't impact your enjoyment.
---
Deaf people can't hear. Talking isn't the problem.
---
If you guys haven’t seen it, here is the remix to this video, great piece of internet history 
---
https://youtu.be/ffvQK_NBt48
---
Might depend, but the TTK is lower when SW procs because you are just wanding after anyway. Also, SWP starts ticking earlier because you cast it earlier.
---
That's like saying priests shouldnt use lesser and greater heal lol.
---
The key to not getting swiped is the healers coordinating properly
---
What are the advantages of attacking from behind in classic? It doesnt seem to be the same no parry no block unless i was doing it wrong
---
you are welcome!
---
Twink is a PvP term. Warden is a PvE item. Twinks and warden staves have nothing to do with each other
---
&gt; The guy avoiding guards on the ground is just using their patrol path optimally.
---
Did you miss the part where I said guards are literally patrolling ON him while he's attacking lowbies? There are Horde who are defending themselves and THEY are the ones getting killed by the guards.
---
&gt;Nah. That's not nearly enough damage to warrant needlessly wasting GCD time being inside the 5sr. Mana and regen are key in leveling.
---
That's why you constantly have spirit tap anyway. Ignoring 5sr.
---
faerlina and Heartseeker are ones that come to mind.
---
Ahhh right you are. Elixir of firepower uses them, not the greater fire prot pot
---
There are a ton of very good swords for leveling.
---
Google for "Rogue sword progression wow" there is a good list.
---
Also you want a slow MH because Sinister Strike uses your MH so you get more dmg of every SS if your MH has more base dmg. 
---
Every guide i've seen takes sword spec because its super good and the best leveling weapons are swords, so just go for it.
---
(Sword of Omen, Trashblade, (Mirahs Song tho its later, the one from rfc(horde only i think).
---
What does your rotation look like? Lighting bolt spam while using shocks of cool down?
---
Felwood, Winterspring, WPL, EPL. With BRD runs I’m the middle
---
Just stop posting man. Live a few more years on this earth, and stop ignorantly judging people you don't even know.
---
What why? Human warriors are THE best pve warriors.
---
Yeah two 1h and combine them.
---
Just keep questing. Go to Felwood, un Goro crater, azshara, winterspring and finally western / eastern plaugelands. Sprinkle in BRD, school, strat, onyxia , MC attunement quests and you’ll be 60 in no time! Focus on your BiS items as well.
---
Level 46 rogue. I’ve been leveling as sub since 31 and have noticed that I no longer have the burst I used to with ambush and backstab. I’ve thought about purchasing a gut ripper on the AH to help but I’m not sure if it’s that or my spec. I’ve considered switching to combat mace spec, for the stun, with 11 points in sub to get improved stealth, speed, and ghostly strike. Would that be a dos &amp; survival upgrade? What should I do until I ultimately go combat swords around 55+? P.s. Playing on a PvP server.
---
Aside from informing that Undead players are humanoids, is the only thing that needs to be read in this thread
---
He’s obviously hiding the keybinds since there is none what so ever, not even on the standard bar.
---
So were both try hards haha. Maybe that's it.
---
Most people are autoshot afk anyways. Play a DPS and there is nothing to listen to anyways. Join discord, put microphone and audio on mute and blast music. Nobody will be any wiser if you are actually listening
---
What's your logic here? He got a free month. That's better than no free month.
---
Even if theres only one person spec'd winters?
---
The last sentence summed up this entire post, the changes "you" want. The overwhelming majority of people that are enjoying classic are enjoying it for what it is, what you may see as a nessecary change others may not, so how about we just appreciate the good and the bad for what it is and accept that all games have flaws and nothing is perfect.
---
Ok so I'm thinking of switching to an ele/resto build around level 45+ in order to start gearing and getting used to rotations so I can be comfortable when I start to farm for pre raid bis. It's a shame tho cause I'm really enjoying the melee-tank playstyle, but healers gotta heal xD. 
---
Thank you for the answers.
---
It does 
---
If your horde go for 2h axes. Do axe of orgrimaar for lvl 13 green axe from chain quest for rfc.
---
Chain quest at barrens for harpies gives zhivour axe lvl 18 or so.
---
From there I'd try to pick up the 2h axe from sfk and use it until 30 for WW.
---
I'm at the zhvour axe right now it's awesome.
---
Until you miss group assignments and THAT'S A 50DKP MINUS!
---
what is your unit frames addon?
---
Yeah I'm leveling an alt for that. I did a warrior first so solo farming 50g/hr is out of the question, and duo farming it is not even trivial. I agree there are higher g/hr ways to farm, but as others have pointed out, fishing is maximum chill
---
The only time daggers really has a chance to be better is if you are in a raid.  If you are doing anything alone, or even in dungeons, swords/maces will be more versatile.
---
If you are leveling alone, combat is going to be the best option, but sub can be ok too.
---
in vanilla my guild had hunter's kite both Baron and Shazz to Garr's room which I think avoid a lot of the packs in shazz room
---
The dogs have stealth detection. Could be them
---
And druids...
---
I've done all three things very well mind you
---
Mom can we get Thunderfury ? 
---
No we already have Thunderfury at home.
---
*At home*
---
To give you night terrors.  Specifically you.
---
Lmfao relax. It's obviously for some semblance of balance.
---
Neeeeeat
---
I think the reason hes so bent out of shape is because he prolly followed a ton of min/max youtube vids that Tipsout or someone else put out and hes still really bad at the game and will never get a Hand of Rag for himself, so he decided to just take something super unimportant like race selection and start chirping about it to make himself feel like he knows more.
---
I promise you someone will find out eventually. Maybe just trying being honest, and if the guild can't deal with it, find a guild that will.
---
You can make your frames dark with Easy Frames aswell for class colors
---
This has been brought up and discussed in vivid detail since before Classic was launched. The theory is known as Classic Plus. Then you have those who wish to continue down the same path into TBC.
---
You must be trolling? Put in the effort #nochanges jesus man stop ya bitching
---
I hope you use /s only in trollish tongue
---
Searing Gorge then Un’Goro. By that point, if you can’t BRD, try and spot fill with some Azshara. Then WPL and EPL. Finish with Winterspring.
---
I got one off a troll in EPL.
---
Did you find both swords in a single run? I've heard of that being a common occurrence for some reason.
---
Wah
---
I'll bet she was a trans woman
---
Exactly, the best way to fight back is to not partake.
---
I have met plenty of old-school oriented casual players that want to play the game the same way they did back then. Without aoe cleave, without obsurd rules where you can't need it unless its your his (Dude, the healer is wearing greens from, ZF and its an upgrade... Let him have it)
---
There's plenty of people that share this mindset, entire guilds actually
---
Sounds to me like that guy ain’t a good enough player to 1v1 so he needs to bring 20 pals along to kill 1 guy
---
You'll probably regret going full prot at 60, like you said yourself unless you're the main tank of your raid guild and/or have no interest in doing anything outside of dungeons.
---
Personally I go 31/5/15 spec, main tanking dungeons all day and off-tanking raids and still being able to swap to 2H for AOE griding and DPS tanking content you're over-geared for as well as having decent solo and PvP.
---
Quel sword is really more of a mitigation weapon, not for threat. Ideally they'll use a Dagger
---
I can live with him being trash but jesus fucking christ the raid atmosphere.
---
Go 10m12s in to hear him screaming into the mic followed up by 15s later having an officer blaming healers when the DW fury warrior tank takes boss and 2x enraged dogs to the face.
---
Absolutely unreal
---
Tailoring + Engineering always. Tailoring both for the Robe, aswell as the upcoming Bloodvine-set bonus which will be available when ZG hit. Engineering for PVP. 
---
Run gathering professions on an alt instead
---
If you want to spec DPS at 60 then do as many BRD runs as you can.
---
Chances are you'll need 100+ of those runs for optimal gear so you might as well get a headstart on your Arena/Angerforge farm.
---
Yes I understand and know that but what would you like to see?
---
Are there any apps/programs that can transcribe audio into text?
---
Honestly it sounds more like an issue with your guild leader, he sounds like a prick for not accommodating. It’s 1/40 and you said your friend knows all the tactics. Fk that guy and find a better guild, sorry for his lack of compassion
---
Dude you are so dumb
---
Batman reference i think
---
Has science gone too far?
---
Have him join, lie and say his mic is busted. It's shitty that the truth isn't enough for people.
---
2 reasons for this. Druids change their form for a living, you dont have the ability to change our form and expect it to stick. This is like trying to drown a fish.  
---
2nd front, forsaken are undead physically, but they have minds, or a will, if you will, stronger than most humanoids. They cant be treated the same way. That said Im sure most forsaken players wouldnt mind if they were treated as undead. I think it would make them immune to more CC than it would make them susceptible to.
---
Looks like you were the lucky ignite owner for that fight
---
This. Same raid lead has a dozen people in there who aren’t going to listen / have discord on mute anyway. The idea that you can’t clear MC without being able to hear the nerd rage on discord is idiotic. I agree with the suggestions to just not even mention this in the future let the deaf friend park in discord and say “no mic” and literally nobody will ever be the wiser.
---
That's what I do already tbh.
---
Just wish I could make gold quicker I don't have herb or mining. Unfortunately is that what you did on repeat
---
I just switched to shadow at 35 because the wand spamming annoyed me. About same amount of damage but the rotation is less annoying.
---
Etc huh ? 
---
Thing the guy was ready to give you a good time there
---
Shut up nerd.
---
Better play mage, warrior, rogue. No group assignment for me (I'm the warrior).
---
Oh sorry I read the post title as "hybrids" not all hybrids except dps.  Plus there's a lot of discussion about ferals in this post.
---
I have a rogue main in retail that I stopped playing after lvl 85 full pvp build i cataclysm.
---
The problem with vanish was that if a nps threw, lets say a throwing axe, it broke vanish if you used the spell while the axe was in mid air. 
---
After cataclysm they gave vanish a buff that made it unbreakable the first seconds after being cast.
---
You further explain yourself In Another post, then proceeded to call me a mongol for not understanding? I don't read minds bro. Nice ad hominem fallacie. I'm out, as it seems you have nothing else to contribute.
---
Go farm the essence of water are like super expensive
---
I find that hard to believe. By the time Naxx was out there were plenty of gear and talent discussions online. Elitist Jerks forum was a wealth of information.
---
Yeah, my guild does this and it works pretty decently albeit slowly since melee don't do anything at all.
---
We just pull him into garr's "room" i guess, form a giant circle with a tank in the middle, if he ports onto you run into the mid. Slow as shit but its smooth
---
I played us servers when I was stationed in Okinawa. Just a bit higher ping but you won’t really notice it.
---
You are unable to have Spirit Tap when you have yet to kill a mob. The key here is utilizing both
---
wow so toxic
---
It's about 200-250g. Not 500g. I mean jeez.
---
Deposit cost is decided by vendor sell price. The only reason you would ever have to use single stacks is if people want to buy them like that
---
Stop being so upset buddy
---
To be fair Tipsout would know a thing or two about fraud considering that buisness he ran...
---
I hope you have a bottomless wallet if you are popping FAPs on every single pvp encounter.

Good thread.
---
- Regularly run and clear dungeons without AOE and I think I ran one dungeon once with a spellcleave. 
---
- None
---
- Okay this one I’ll give you but I don’t ever go to Arathi
---
- Fairly regularly, otherwise I wouldn’t have been able to nab a bag pattern for myself. 
---
I will say however, I wouldn’t mind some buffs across the board to content. Maybe mix up spawn and drop rates or even loot tables altogether. Even if they do it on a single fresh server, I’d 100% play it.

I've been away for like 5 years but I'm wanting to active my account again for Classic. Is it a separate expansion I have to purchase or anything like that? How do I prevent my character from exceeding the cap if not?

You could classify them as humanoid and deal with this minor inconvenience OR! Classify them as an undead and give them a permanent resistance to fear,sleep, and charm. Blizzard did this for a reason. In the wow beta undead were classified as undead and will of the forsaken was a permanent buff, but they decided it was to strong and made them humanoid. Leave Druids alone! They have enough adversity to overcome as it is!
---
In never really understood why people pull him so far back into he other room. Sure you can avoid some trash but it’s like it doesn’t take that long plus more chances at BoEs. To each their own. Whatever works for you!
---
No one will notice unless it starts causing problems. If the deaf player is capable of completing raid content while relying on the instructions of his friend, then no one will even notice him. But if he is reacting too late to raid mechanics or causing problems for the raid then not only will they find out, but the deaf player would deserve the kick.
---
People don't care about you until it starts to be a problem. And if they notice you're a problem, then you shouldn't be there. It's not up to the raid to carry a deaf player if they can't overcome the handicap.
---

It depends on how hard you're trying.  Getting to FR cap is huge, because you resist all the knockbacks, which means less coordination necessary and less chance for fuckups.  
---
You probably still want defense and stam.  I wouldn't do something like go out and buy all the FR greens you can.  I think 250 buffed with good mitigation would be a good idea.  If it's your guild's first time, it's worth heading out to get the UBRS buff.
---
You know it, mon
---
I am sure most guilds will be ok with it. Last week I killed ony with a 30 man pug without discord.
---
I disagree. 
---
They could very easily change stats for things, change drop tables, mob spawns, and other things that MIX UP the experience while keeping the general game the same. 
---
All the stats still work the same
---
But maybe items that USED to be BIS arent anymore. No differently than balance changes that happened from original release to 1.12. 
---
Tiny, minor tweaks that in no way would change how the game feels but would freshen up the experience.
---
To say "there isn't a way to put the genie back in the bottle" is close minded, that's to say you don't want to adapt, you dont want to experience the game from the start again without knowing everything.

as long as they remain civil, not calling out, making fun or condemning others who choose to play differently.

Actually your wrong on the raid thing the only class that’s honestly useless in raids is a rogue.

---
What realm?
---
I’m sceptical that this was done without taking advantage of layers, but even then, it’s still impressive.
---
Other classes depend on their weapons for damage. For druids, weapons are stat sticks. 30% haste&gt; any stat stick. You lose the buff when swapping weapons, so there's no incentive for other classes.
---
You really are a special kind of moron, aren't you? It's amazing to see what kinds of people this cesspool of a sub attracts at times.
---
Ore else where?
---
So that was apparently uncivil and disrespectful. [so choke on this picture and stop spreading lies] (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/383597123775758375/630572579639394305/unknown.png)

Yes, we’re running only 1 WC mage in our roster
---
Guess it depends on the server. On my server its 480g. Essence of water is around 25-30g a pop.
---
The point of going 2h fury on horde is big WF procs. This is trash
---
Many raid leader assholes I guess. 
---
What I would do is to join discord and fake it. You just make sure you whisper your friend what is being said on discord
---
Lol I actually hate when people do that too. The items I sold for profit were cut by like 1g for no reason. They were selling fast too so cutting them was just a waste.
---
Bro saaaaammme I hate AoE farming. I wish I rolled a Rogue so I could just do BRD pickpocket runs.
---
So you aren't a healer?
---
The prot tree has fuck all in terms of mitigation past the first 3 rows---The bottom 4 rows are damage and utility.
---
The only defensive thing you can't get in under 20 points is Improved Shield Wall and oh boy, 5 more seconds on your 30 minute CD oh shit button.
---
But Shield Spec, Improved Shield Block, Last Stand, Toughness, Anticipation, those are the only real defensive talents in the tree and you can get any you want in under 20 points.
---
The only real downside to Fury/Prot is the lack of Tactical Mastery to make stance dancing functional.
---
Warlocks can solo dme, why split your profits lol
---
Oh. Yeh. You right.
---
oh jeez, that is expensive. In my server essences go from 10-15g and I thought *that* was expensive.

---
You watch Youtube videos to learn about the game. I actually play it. Big difference.
---
The straightforward answer is no.
---
As an off tank on ragnaros I had this exact question. The tl;dr is that you want as much fire resist as possible, up to 315, even at the cost of armor - wearing volanic leather set is ok if you don't have access to the crafted dark iron armor. His melee attacks are physical and can be blocked, the DoT/knockback is fire.
---
I examined our logs and saw that at least two thirds of the damage taken was from fire (the DoT he puts on you). The other major reason to have max fire resist is to resist his knockback. We think even if you resist this knockback he still does a threat reduction on the tank so use taunt after resisting.
---
I just started on Grobbulus. I was greeted by someone's alt when I entered Darnassus for the first time; he gave me 5 stacks of different potions, 10g, and 4 mage weave bags. It was incredible. A few days later I made my way into Goldshire Inn and RPd with a very nice group of innkeepers and patrons. One night elf got so drunk he nearly fell down the stairs into the basement. I gave him some water and a boar's leg I just cooked, and in his drunken stupor gave me 4 gold. It's been an amazing server thus far!
---
What a lame reference
---
Yeah I ended up reading up on it.  
---
I lost all interest when they made some terrible calls in the duelers league.  Only reason I throw it on in the background is I’m almost 32 and way too busy to play my self.
---
In retail you just can turn wm  off it's like pre server then
---
I used limeguide to make leveling less painful.  Was good for me.  I didnt get to WPL till 57 on my warrior and had plenty of quests to do till 60.
---
Even monk’s green color names aren’t like this kind of green lol... they are more like dark green
---
Totally agree. Res sounded cool at first until we had some time with it. And then the pvp gear was better than some of the pve gear. Definitely aspects of bc not good but overall it helped a lot of QoL issues.
---
Yeah man shit like elitistjerks didn't exist and nobody had spreadsheets or anything like that everyone just fumbled around aimlessly. People only recently started min/maxing and trying to do their best, yep, that's how I choose to remember it.

Yeah, you had to search for it outside the game really, though. Loads of wow players never go to reddit now and the same thing applies to the ej website back then.

This is a common thread, tbh. For me, the main thing I want is a retuning of the numbers for underperforming specs. Essentially make the gap between meta DPS and meme DPS much smaller, for instance. I'm not as fussed about anything else, personally.

Imagine making a living playing this game and being such a shit raid leader

Granted, but resto and feral are nerfed to an unplayable state

Yeah you guys naxx attuned and in stepped inside. This isn't really a great "see you don't have to try so much" post, considering you guys definitely didn't kill any of the bosses and don't have much AQ gear.

I’m not even playing a paladin in classic at the moment. Congrats on getting defensive about one of the strongest pvp classes in the game though? You sound like a FOTM player haha.
---
Thought this was already confirmed? One of our main tanks is prot paladin and thats what he does. No problems with aggro
---
I know some people will disagree but this is my take as well. I PvE to PvP. I’m not busting my ass and popping consumers week after week to be able to do it sliiightly faster next week with my new sword. I’m getting that sword to go crush other players.
---
Hey thanks for adding to the conversation with your really in depth analysis. I'm glad we got your opinion out there, and you're entitled to it. Hope you have a good day and you remember to breathe :)
---
This is straight up a shitpost, there is absolutely no way this ever happens.
---
There are lots of these items in classic that are rare quality, decent items, with absolutely bonkers materials.  The arcanite alone is worth 500g for this thing, no way it's worth that.  The other materials all together might be worth 100g or more.  
---
I guarantee when you equip this item and test it out, you will have instant regret.  Blacksmithing is full of these things, it's one of the reasons why blacksmithing sucks.
---
Granted, however some monsters have started carrying traps in their pockets that are sprung when you pickpocket them
---
Two suggestions: make it clear that's it's due to being deaf, not unwillingness. Then raid lead is more likely to give a chance (I'd hope). 
---
Just join discord if it's just pugs anyways? 
---
In any case I think it would be easier if you were to join a guild where the GM / raid lead knows his situation, trusts his ability to adhere to tactics, and maybe throws him a message once in a while if there's something specific for him to do.
---
I'm workin on it! Got my warrior to 52 last night lol.
---
And here we go being dismissive and labeling shit, defeating the entire purpose of discussion. Pro change or not, people like YOU can eat me.
---
As opposed to classic
---
It's a scumbag move but technically can't he use it? I don't know much on caster stats but doesn't this have the same stats a mage or lock would need? I don't see any class specific ability bonuses either.

I started with skinning/ench as i leveled, got my trinket, hit 60 and dropped both, now i have 300/300 alch/herb.

Best route would have been to level with ench.

I can actually give you two alliance warlock names on my realm who is botting in arathi. Running the exact circle every time and tagging only elementals nothing else. Good thing is you can use this to your advantage. I just tagged the mob and let them kill it for 3 hours straight.

:D

Will remember that one if some future GF likes wow, just for fun :)

As a Co-GM of my guild I am embarrassed for the raid leaders you have had to deal with.  I would welcome you with open arms if you guys are Alliance on Incendius.  Crimson Corps is a competitive guild, we are good at what we do but we’re not hardcore assholes like these chumps. Come on in.

---
I miss when they were like fucking 20k and I could hoard them.
---
The buff is so common and due to the 3 hours cooldown it's hard to set up for the entire raid.
---
Thus to conclude, no selling warchiefs is not really a thing, at least not yet, as of currently most servers has this thing popping within 30 mins of it being off cooldown
---
What they don’t know doesn’t hurt. Telling the leader he’s deaf was just a mistake. If they tell your friend something then just relay it to him.
---
Elemental is much more of a memey one-trick spec. Trades defenses for instants, essentially.
---
nope, maybe higher graphic settings?
---
Sounds more like tanks having threat management issues.
---
If you absolutely need to get a threat reduction talent you can spec into Demo DM where Imp provides 15% reduction.
---
I would love to experience it fresh again. But that isn't reality.
---
It's unrealistic for me to demand the designers cater to such vague whims. It has nothing to do with me not wanting to adapt, it is understanding how unrealistic it is to expect such a monumental undertaking to implement what you're you're suggesting. I don't adhere to some monolithic desire to have no changes, since I lived through the game already which was constantly shifting every patch - currently we reside in a world where it is static. And that is the menu we are presented. 
---
Would it be nice for new alterations to provide more challenge or new experiences? Well yeah. But that isn't the idea behind Classic. So we best enjoy it or be unsatisfied with dreams of something the dev's never intended. Just how it is. Kevin Jordan himself commented about this too, and I tend to agree with him.

Thanks, I wish you a wonderful day as well!

I might try that after I raid tonight because this is getting really irritating.
---
Yeah I looked it up. I know it's priest set in theory but what is restricting a mage or lock from it. Is it just the etiquette?
---
Just join and say *no mic*. 
---
There can be many issues, complications or discussions for specific needs, but this is not the hill to die upon. Let's not be overly dramatic for the sake of making a point.

Yeah you can argue it, but spirit is meant for Priests.
---
The issue I find is those who assume you are farming Devilsaurs. Many don’t realize that un’goro is a great place for farming thorium, soil, sprouts, herbs, and essences. But no everyone assumes that if you are in the area. You want those darn dinosaurs. I play a paladin. I laugh every time I am killed by a hunter or rogue while farming there. Do you really think it is worthwhile for my little paladin to try and maybe kill a elite like that assuming I even have skinning. Or is it more likely I am farming everything else in the zone that actually gets me money in a decent time frame. 
---
I spent a hour there yesturday and got about 200g worth of mining mats, herbs, potions, greys, and greens from everything else you can farm in the zone. Screw your leather I don’t need for any equipment.

---
I don't disagree about OoT at all but it is a linear experience designed around playing once or maybe twice. mmorpgs are supposed to be living breathing worlds and you're paying a sub to boot. WoW is definitely the reason MMOs aren't using emergent systems anymore and if you are not using emergent gameplay then you are reliant on drip feeding content to give people something to do. Which can only take a game so far. Classic can't stay static forever. It's the same reason they are doing the phases.

Every 100 FR is a 25% fire damage reduction. So I’d say aim for 250 minimum  maybe get UBRS buff and greater fire prot.

If your dps aren't good enough this won't work. This might surprise you but not everyone is as good as you are, oh mighty one.
---
Yeah but if the deaf player CAN keep up, then it doesn't matter because no one will find out or even care.
---
This isn't a server problem. You've done way too much mining for your level. Unless you need it for something you've wasted your time unfortunately. Keep what you need for leveling your other profession and vendor the rest. The low level ores, herbs, etc. are everywhere in starting zones which is why you can't sell it. Until you get to level 40 you should be saving gold for a mount, which is why nobody is buying your auctions of low level materials that everyone can easily get for themselves.
---
What the fuck.
---
So is there any real reason people hate comic sans or is it just a thing to hate comic sans for no reason reason?
---
I guarantee that if you were to "LF1M Prot Paladin for MC" you would only find trash players. Good players understand the limitations of their class. They don't show up to raids trying to tank on a Paladin.
---
i have 95+ parses
---
you are just a shitter
---
Just remove flying, and it would be as perfect as could be.

Boomkin
---
No immolate and that’s pretty much how a group of locks would function raiding in phase 1.
---
Van Cleef did nothing wrong.
---
I’m a 57 warrior now and asked the same question you did at 52.
---
I tried prot for about 48 hours but the unpredictability if finding groups for living in BRD and dealing with PUGs for that was not fun. It was a mixed bag. 
---
I decided to go back to Arms open world questing which I like more.
---
I’ll go back and farm pre-bis when I hit 60 and will be a hot commodity as a 60 prot warrior LFG for end game dungeons.
---
I just like open world questing more than living in a dungeon.
---
What’s the addon that shows class colours in your target frame?
---
The problem starting with no money, and no real way to make money if the products are listed too low, is that I don't have the coin to buy the stuff all out and list it at a profit.
---
dude either way all 3 of those robes suck
---
Shamans eat paladins
---
better odds with that method than crying on reddit
---
Not exactly. Every letter in Comic Sans has some slight difference that makes them easier to distinguish (eg different thickness, height, position). Most normal fonts try to keep letters fairly similar (constant thickness, same-height letters etc).
---
And you have full mana before the first mob, so who cares. You aren't going oom because you miss a gcd of Regen after being at 100%. Sorry, but your reasoning is nonsensical.
---
You're really gonna be upset when you see paladins wearing wildheart and warriors rolling on leather later.
---
I was gonna say that's how we're already doing phase 1 raids.  Agony is just a waste of a debuff slot.
---
Getting the jump on someone in the middle of a quest isn't really a fair 1v1
---
That has nothing to do with what I said. I didn’t say he didn’t play day 1. I said he was against it until he saw that he could make money off it. It was very obvious from even before beta how much hype there was and that there was a lot of money to made off streaming the release.
---
Better to use the claws from MC
---
This comment is ironic.
---
It's clear hes trying to take a Alex, Jeff Kaplan, Ion, path to Blizzard. Former players who get hired to develop and balance the game 
---
Hes hoping to get hired, because hes such a "top player" and "knows so much".
---
How should this macro look like?
---
I want Raptor Strike to start shooting my bow if im from afar but use Raptor strike if im close
---
/cast Auto Shot
---
/cast Raptor Strike
---
doesn't seem to work, neither does;
---
Wrong. Spirit can also be used on mages who have a 45% mana regen during cast which helps TREMENDOUSLY during long raid fights.
---
Case closed
---
Modified class abilities and talents, and also straight up broken abilities and talents that havent been touched since launch
---
That's why my alt is a Druid and I've been raiding on my Warlock.  xD
---
&gt;WTB Freezing Band
---
Well, hope the luck will come to me. Thank you! Gonna consider spamming trade chat from time to time.
---
Little whiny entitled ppl like you made the game what it is today / trash
---
It's not a ninja. Jesus. If a priest took Arcanists, that would be ninja. If the raid lead took Teebos after losing a roll, that would be ninja. Casters can use it, and it's an upgrade, it's not a ninja. Stop being so dramatic on blue gear nowhere close to being BiS.
---
My buddy is a rogue and we have no problem inviting a 2nd rogue to some dungeons, but we dont invite a 3rd rogue because that's just a bad comp and too much competition for loot.
---
Rogues throw the BIGGEST fits when I dont invite them, even if I'm spamming for ranged dps
---
For real. I want to try something different than what I used to main, but the survivability as paladin was great. I could win 2v1s and I wasn't even good. you feel like a mini-boss
---
I'd advise extreme caution in your case. Nothing this game will ever give you is worth losing what you have.
---
The problem is more that warriors are known to be superior dps but that is only when they are geared. In reality you're probably much better off with a rogue, mage, or lock which are really the premier dps classes to 60 imo. After gearing warriors shoot to the top of single target dps, rogues are usually very close, but both classes leave casters and hunters behind in terms of single target dps by a solid margin. 
---
Just dont let that 54 warr in brd who is dual wielding convince you he is dps bc if u look at a meter your tank probably does close to the same dmg
---

*I can't believe you've done this.jpg*
---
Amp Curse Imp Agony is actually pretty solid. But the only way you're doing that is if you have 4 locks, which means 3-4 corruptions and 3 curses, so it's up to the raid to judge if there is room.
---
What you are saying is you were an addict, and you want our permission to get back into it?
---
You only have 1 health.
---
If you have a backup plan to get out on time you can start.
---
is there really anyone with the motivation to read this
---
Shadowmeld has honestly saved me in world PvP more than Escape Artist ever would. Being able to choose exactly when you want to fight and being able to eat/drink while melded is pretty OP.

My biggest gripe with it was how it directly benefited warlocks over mages due to it reducing spell crit chance, and sl locks not caring because dots didn't crit.

That’s fair, I don’t watch streams much it’s mostly YouTube so there isn’t any downtime
---
You should be able to tank brd and lbrs and eventually ubrs with arms spec,  no need for prot although it probably helps.
---
Hi mate. Please stop insulting people on the sub.
---
Hey guys , I just sold Head of Onyxia to a guy in raid for 200G . Is that a good enough price ? How much are they generally worth on your servers ?
---
I've gotta say, my favorite zone is probably Gilneas. The worgen starting zone is by far my favorite. It's kinda sad to me that it's currently left abandoned in-game at the moment, but I find myself going back to visit it on my worgen main every now and then. Walking through the empty city, admiring the great architecture, awesome music, and dark atmosphere is a really nice feeling. I hope that it gets restored in the future so we can see the city flourishing like it deserves! :)
---
Im not horde, so I dont really know them that well
---
Where did I say it couldn’t be used?
---
Dumb AF
---
I like the strafe sometimes, depends on how hard the mob hits
---
Wow so many ninjas in this thread. If you roll need on an item in a group youre SUPPOSED to equip not be a scumbag and sell it on the AH. That's what a greed roll is for. So many ninjas. Go back to retail.
---
Have him join Discord, get a phone and put it next to the output and turn on Google Keyboard (speech to text) it’s pretty fast. Then have him use text to voice if they role call him. “Heya” 
---
Then you help him like you were planning to smooth any bumps....
---
Seems pretty easy to me. Hope this idea helps.
---
people are telling me to sacrifice items for crit rather than hit. people say i only need 6% but ur telling me to stack as much hit as possible. how do i know what to do its so fustrating
---
no songflower buff. yes i usually buy pots for raid.
---
Only thing you need to do is level your priest.
---
Wambulance
---
Can confirm. Got warrior to 60 weeks ago - 2 alts level 1 bankers / bag holders.
---
No desire to grind again.
---
Using the Final Fantasy victory fanfare in a WoW video
---
Sacrilege
---
Also there’s this little evil trick kind of in the same vein:
---
Duel a horde who isn’t PvP but you are
---
Wait until they start attacking you and then type /forfeit 
---
They’ll attack you thinking they’re still dueling and flag themselves PvP, you can now attack them. 
---
Saw this so many times back in the day. People are a lot smarter nowadays tho, doesn’t work as often.
---
I mean yeah. :D I'm still used to calling it vanilla because classic is a fairly new term.
---
Basically this, along with Hunters having a lot more potential to fuck things up. Bad players of another class usually go unnoticed, but a bad Hunter is extremely easy to spot. 
---
Pet taunting, pet controlling (for runners specifically), forget to turn off aspect of the pact, multishot being your main DPS and it having confusing range causes inexperienced players to break cc, pet aggroing around corners, jumping without dismissing pet even if it's a tiiiiny little ledge, running out of arrows, running out of pet food and losing 50% of your DPS, etc. 
---
Then the other aspect of your post is also true. I don't know if I ever saw another hunter I've grouped with use a trap. I consistently trap on basically every pull. At the very least, I drop an aoe frost trap incase shit goes back so we can kite (which it has a *lot*). So few hunters use traps that people are actually amazed at the potential a hunter can bring to an aoe group with the slow.
---
there aren't any names visible though
---
All good man I wasn't trying to being dramatic. And it's not about it's being BiS or not, it's the ignorance and the lack of "courtesy" behind it that makes me wonder how greedy (and rude) people can be for items ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
You don't have to lie to anyone. They asked you to get in discord, just get in discord. It's more about being able to follow basic instructions than anything. If I asked someone to do something in my raid and they refused, they would be getting kicked no matter what I asked them. Leading a raid is a pain in the ass, I don't feel like arguing with 39 people every time I ask them to do something. Just do it the first time I ask.
---
I'm not wrong though..
---
Playing it from day 1 has literally nothing to do with what I said. It was very obvious long before launch day how much money you could make streaming the release of the game. And even though he was outspoken against it, he streamed day 1, thus confirming my original statement. Idk if he makes money, I care they he talked negatively about something and then literally used that same thing to make money lol.
---
A big list of trivial stuff.. I think you made their point clear
---
*Hey kid, wanna buy some soul shards?*
---
Someone rolling need on an upgrade, I’m sorry you felt entitled to that item but the dice decided otherwise.
---
You can....but you probably shouldn't.  Its a matter of, you may have changed and now have the ability to regulate your life with WoW in it.  Or you haven't and could fall back in to terrible habits that destroy your life outside of the game.  The risks are too high and there's a bunch of other video games where you'll finish them after a set time and not to play for a billion hours.
---
Whatever genre you like there's games that offer a more fixed experience.  I wouldn't advise this game given your history.
---
The other healers are in high demand as well, just harder to gear because there's more competition.
---
Ah, I see.  I am not sure if the other Luna stuff works with SUF, sorry.
---
Then the immunities they get for shapeshifting are perfectly fine. Thanks for the quick answer!
---
I think your just a condescending asshole that gets off putting others down. You seemingly enjoy reddit confrontation.
---
Because to me it's not about some sort of vague and undefined vanilla """experience""", it's about playing vanilla, full stop. Look at the popularity of classic Nintendo games, or the speedrunning community to understand how games which have been "solved" for years can still be enjoyable to those who cherish them.
---
Additionally, I don't see how adding new content or revamping old content would do any better of a job at keeping the vanilla "experience" because you're literally experiencing different shit.
---
What realm are you on? We have a deaf person in my guild and it hasn’t been an issue at all. I’m on Heartseeker
---
They should hotfix druids and paladins to make them viable to main tank in raids. Im sick of the #nochanges bullshit.
---
Been ele since 40.. No need to downrank in instances.. Just have to drink after every encounter
---
Okay just making sure... I'm a little light on gold at the moment so I went with the far cheaper option lol
---
This. People are assholes but also stupid and easily fooled.
---
And yet he's the one with a bank full of lotus' so i mean.
---
&gt; A massive instance like BRD, itself an experience where you're supposed to explore and enjoy, instead being either cleared by AoE groups or groups specifically running to only a few bosses
---
why does it matter to you how my groups run our brd?
---
brd has prebis gear, and Im sorry but after being in there for the 115th time trying to get savage gladiator chain or hand of justice, there isnt shit left to be explored.
---
I spent too much time in my twenties playing EQ and WoW, but with classic I'm just enjoying seeing the original game with a full population and a good graphics card. Set a timer if you need to, but I don't think there's enough classic content to lose yourself entirely.
---
I can't even hear the EQ theme music without thinking of the mental state I was in back then, but WoW is a little easier to moderate, see the sites, finish a few quests, and shut it off.
---
Thanks man. Yeah I don't think I've mentioned or showed his name in that image. Just amazed about his "argument" when I clearly said I needed that  upgrade and every one including other mages in the run passed on it.
---
Welp, just another day in Classic I guess haha good luck to u too.
---
Nobody cares what your previous experience is, and not everyone suggesting changes intend to make it more like retail.
---
Fact is we're already playing classic+, with a massive amount of changes from vanilla. 
---
OP is simply pointing that out and acknowledging that there are some good obvious fixes out there that can't be implemented because of some arbitrary rules from a hypocritical nochanges cult who are already playing classic+
---
No idea why every neutral / helpful response in this thread has minus values 
---
Thanks man
---
I’ve been PvPing for years on vanilla PSers and now on Classic, playing mostly only a rogue, and I still get what you’re describing sometimes. Especially against my two biggest weaknesses: shammys and locks. I don’t know why but I just start button mashing and lose all sense of my rotation and playing smart. I guess maybe some people are just like how we are in certain situations in life.
---
Good vid; i loled
---
You don't seem to understand how threat works.
---
Warriors in Berserker Stance (and all Rogues + Druids in cat form) have a 0.8 threat modifier. In addition to that, melee DPS need to achieve 110% of the tank's threat in order to actually pull aggro. That means their threat before pulling aggro is roughly ~70% of their actual DPS.
---
~0.7 * 500 DPS = ~350 TPS
---
Ranged don't have the lower threat modifiers, but they need to achieve 130% of the tank's threat to pull aggro, which leads to about the same result.
---
Sunder Armor is 378 threat per application with Defensive Stance and Defiance. With a 1.5 sec global cooldown, that's 252 TPS from Sunder Armor alone. Add in auto attacks and you're easily getting 350 TPS.
---
Revenge, Shield Slam, Deep Wounds, Impale, etc. only increase that threat even more.
---
TBH they can probably kill anub'rekhan and maybe raz in the gear they are in.
---
Yeah, but pre raid items are irrelevant. What matters is your opportunity to gear in the raid, because that's the gear you want. Also, you shouldn't be running daggers in raid before you have perds, it's literally like bringing another meme-spec to raid.
---
That’s the server I’m on lol.
---
Sup man!
---
I said looking for an ally majority realm 
---
You’re an idiot
---
This is where you are correct.
---
It's not that it can't be done, it's a matter of how much time and effort has to go into it. And that is where, at the end of the day, Blizzard would rather make whole new expansions instead of just refreshing old content. 
---
Realistically I understand and respect this. But to say this is a thing that is just impossible, I don't know. 
---
If the community really wanted it, if we were really willing to pay for it, Blizzard would do it. I am happy classic exists at all, I will be happy if classic+ exists, I will be happy if it doesnt. I am just here for the ride.
---
I know. Which is why I said the OP should just use "vanilla" instead of the weird modifier of "true vanilla"...
---
You follow?
---
it's so fucking dumb.people act like knowing a character name does anything like its their realid
---
What’s the least gear dependent class?
---
I dint plan on or have a desire to raid, so I know I’ll be behind in terms of BiS for phase 2. What class gives me the best chances to still win even behind on gear? Warlock?
---
The trick is to shift out into caster and cast hots, moon fire and fearie fire and let there cast cancel
---
Druids and shamans seem to be pretty in demand in raiding on my server. I know my guild barely has any, and I see every recruiting guild spam wanting them.
---
Well thats mostly true. Ive watched him on and off for some time. like a few hours a week at most. but ive lost complete interest in his way of entertaining after the beta. I was in his guild and it was a lot of fun. But he is to me the kind of guy that can get "too much" if you know what i mean. Its an on/off thing for me
---
Which server do I have to xfer to for recruitment to this guild?
---
Every profession in Classic uses bars and not ore. Only JC needs ore.
---
Okay, I'm sure this rogue would've hit 60 before them if they did 5-mans instead of the 7-mans they did......
---
it's a wow sub so obviously not
---
These retail burnouts are weird.
---
Let us enjoy classic.
---
There is actually faction specific versions of the sheet, so the horde version is naturally with Shamans instead of Paladins - so no worries there!
---
You can clear current content with 20 people, get out of here with that garbage.
---
stop wasting your time farming copper ore and start farming mobs.
---
Never
---
I mean not really. You try holding aggro with full raid geared players on prot pal. His first pal vid was bad, but the second one was on the mark. As somebody who's warrior tanked on pservers, and rolling pally in classic, paladin really just can't tank very well. Its missing critical tools that every tank needs.
---
Some would argue camping someone with 20 other raid members is even less fair

if want to watch mage streams check out frostadamus. He is very chill and knows a lot about the game. He is also a very humble man that actually takes his time to answer questions and is in general a polite and entertaining guy. sort of like madseason in terms of chillness.
---
I must have not seen the second one. It was a struggle to make it through the first.
---
How do they change the font?
---
You try orchidee vanille and rose rouge?
---
It's crazy the memories that come flooding back. I ran past Maestras post earlier. I remember in classic finding a close friend, asleep in Bear form at the top of the tower. This friend killed himself 2 years ago, drove into the path of an oncoming truck.
---
Yea but this is just a picture of a bat, there's no man
---
Like anyone has any AP before the 50's
---
You might have enough to double your weapon DPS, which means your damage range still counts for half value.
---
And what happens when we reach AQ or Naxx and these people become literal deadweights, and everyone in the raid knows if they had another Fury warrior/mage/lock/rogue instead of them, they wouldn't had wiped or they would save a shitton of time because of faster clears?
---
I don’t judge :P also I know of a few discord servers that would argue about shamans and priests tanking abilities.
---
I actually do the same whenever I'm low on gold! It doesn't really matter until you're really pushing/struggling in raids further on anyways.
---
I feel like cleave groups must be more of a pvp server kind of problem than a pve one; I’ve only been in two so far and I’m at 55.
---
Any horde maybe?
---
Yeah fair point I've put it back up.
---
It fucks up your stat weights and pumps str/AP over agi/crit.
---
But that stops being true very quickly because of how crit starved warriors are before 55+
---
You can’t use the medicine bag for low level twinks in classic. I don’t remember the exact level but there’s some level requirement (~40).
---
you never use curse of weakness its useless, you use curse of reckless to make melee do more damage.  
---
and the SM/Ruin locks only put up corruption
---
Does Arcane Shot reset my auto shot timer?
---
And is there any list of spells/abilities i can use that i dont need to weave in after the auto goes off?
---
You clearly don't realize it but this is the EXACT reason that expecting to get the AH price on items sold through /2 is incredibly selfish. The person who listed it on the ah took a risk with his deposit by doing so, and with the knowledge that he'd lose 5% even if it sells. You, on the other hand, are expecting to get "full value" for the item with NO risk and NO middleman cut. If I buy from you, then I'm actually screwing over the other guy even harder, and since both of you are strangers to me, if you're both asking the same price, I'd prefer to reward the person who took the largest risk. If you can't see that I'm doing you a favor by buying from you in /2, and don't figure that into the negotiation of the price, then you are a selfish idiot.
---
Ya I don't get it. A gaming PC, but can't afford the 15$. Ok, I'll sympathize there. To spend hours playing WoW when 15$ is going to break u? That's nuts. Id never let myself be in that situation. Jobs basically grow on trees now as well, so the other responses are shit. Just because it isn't your "dream job with a 401k match and benefits" doesn't mean it's hard to get a job.
---
You can be dead and in a party with someone and still get rep for their kills without getting xp.
---
After a wipe in BRD we all ran back from the graveyard in SG, five ghosts together. The tank asked what went wrong and suddenly there were only four ghosts. The healer was typing a response and he fell into the pit.
---
Some would argue that why should you get the best PvP gear in a pve raid? 
---
I think tbc gear is spot on
---
thanks, i hate it.
---
I leveled to 60 as a spriest doing both for all dungeons. Dont know what youre talking about
---
What's the addon that gives you the top bar
---
Does anyone know a good addon that shows dps or dpm when you hover over your spells on your cast bar?
---
I exhausted nearly all of my gold to craft Truefaith Vestments
---
I'm back up to about 50g now
---
Warrior will be the most painful class to level, but at 60 they are the best at everything including pvp, tanking and dps
---
Maybe with consumables and world buffs, but according to OP theorycrafting wasn't a thing when he played and apparently there were no resources for raiding info, so I doubt it.
---
It’s not like he said these were his last dollars lol. Maybe he’s a college student.
---
Heresy
---
You also get extra rage from critting.
---
With early itemsation you only have arond 19% crit while you maintain 4.5-5k health and 5% hit.These 19% are just not  sufficient to keep up the pressure. A warrior not critting hits like a wetnoodle and any healer can heal through that pitiful damage.
---
Only later once the +sword is supported by +crit on your gear, you swap over to sword.
---
R10 gear, onslaught, ony neck, QSR + accuria, blastershot is probably the breaking point where you have enough +hit from only a few pieces that you can stack crit in others (like switching blackstone ring and blackcrow to QSR and blasteshot due to accuria.
---
Reported.
---
I understand it's not uncommon for people to project,  like with pedophile pastors.
---
But it's kind of silly you're accusing the poster above of being 14 and unable to afford wow, just because he asked if OP was.
---
It's clear he just doesn't have empathy, lol.
---
Nah, you’ll just win every 1v1 pvp encounter
---
Idk, but you can track it in chatlog without any add ons.
---
Can even set up a window that only tracks who looted what.
---
Narratively undead cannot become paladins without experiencing constant excruciating pain. The light burn undead when it touches them.
---
Priests are able to get around it because they only channel the light, they can turn it on/off life a switch. Lore-wise there are even very few undead holy priests, most of them are shadow/discipline. To heal their wounded the forsaken mostly rely on apothecary and "surgical" methods of recovery and transplants.
---
Paladins, on the other hand, are infused with light at all times, the light is a part of their body. To be an undead paladin would be constant agony. In the case of Sir Zeliek, his devotion and resolve were so strong that he was able to endure being a paladin even in undeath. This is the exception, not the rule.
---
Player characters in Vanilla weren't meant to be some super-powerful force on par with significant lore characters like they are now in retail, so it makes sense that even if there are some outliers that show certain race/class combos that they are special and not your everyday new recruit.
---
It's possible to do it with some low level players but you will have a very hard time finding a group that will be willing to essentially carry you through a dungeon.
---
Stick to LBRS and BRD until you hit 58, people are generally willing to invite a level 58/59.
---
If you have zero control of yourself and your activities, then absolutely not. I would recommend looking up how to discipline yourself since you seem to be extremely sensitive to addiction. 
---
Routines may be mundane but humans actually desire routine. When you don't have discipline, you start to feel disconnected because you KNOW you should be doing "x,y,z" but you put it off for time in a digital game that means nothing in the real world.
---
Yeah in theory sure but not in reality, there is alot of prejudice against offspeccs and many wont give you a chance to show off ur ability to play a class. 
---
Im ret and I do great dmg in dungeons, especially the undead ones but sometimes I get passed on cause ”lul ret”
---
What strategy are they even doing? I've never seen it before
---
Undead having the most op pvp racial in the game should have been balanced by being priest CC'd.
---
Like it was the first few months in classic.
---
Definitely druid.

Are you using any auto shot timers? I had this problem when I used the YAHT addon in the beginning. Since then, I switched to using WeaponSwingTimer and I have not had the same issues at all. First time doing Molten Core with YAHT issues was a nightmare, but I have no problems now!
---
We split into 3 groups and the melee use their bows to do a bit of ranged DPS
---
Some do, some don't.  I've found than anything 'of the eagle' i.e int and stamina sells like crazy!  level 25 junk selling for 5g+.  I think it's because of a new wave of fast levelling mage alts wanting to gear up quickly and they need the int/stam for their aoe shenanigans.
---
I did so many god damn runs there and never saw the sword off the dual boss with the snakes area. Idk his name but damn grats! Personally I don’t care what anyone says. That is dope af weapon speed being fast wouldn’t deter me from flossing on everyone. That has such high dps that it may still get close for pve. With wind fury would be sick if u get multiple procs. Grats brotha!
---
This was very helpful info and is appreciated!
---
Was BobbyBoucher taken?

It's a strange world. When I think about it, I've been the same for gaming challenges ever since I was young. I'm 34 now. More recently I've put the spin onto physical exercise, but there is always a gaming itch. Always.
---
Have you seen some of the beards on these dwarves tho?
---
So me stating a fact, that he hits for physical and not fire, means I'm saying don't stack FR? You're reading in way too much in me simply correcting him for stating incorrect facts.
---
You can tank the entire 5 man content in the game as a DPS spec. There's no need to spec prot until you're about tank MC/Ony
---
So keep questing as arms while finding a group, then slap on a shield and tank the instance.
---
This is an excellent explanation and very interesting, thank you!
---
Quel is a bad tank weapon. It's too slow and mitigation procs are bad.
---
Boars are dope for low level dungeons like wailing caverns because you can fight a caster and wait for them to start casting a heal or something, then send the boar in to interrupt! You can also keybind boars charge and call it back then hit charge when at correct range to interrupt without losing pet dps, but it’s tricky to do just right and consistently interrupt
---
Theorycrafting existed but knowledge of the game was way, way lower. If you were raiding current content there really weren't resources. Most guilds in contention for world/us/server rankings kept their strats tight. They didnt release videos until after the kills and blizzard provided no resources on boss abilities. Watching a kill video only gives so much info anyways. There were no boss guides for current content. You were figuring it all out as you went. There was no centralized database. 
---
With that said... Anub'rekhan is pretty easy and if you have 2 priests with 4% hit raz isn't much harder. My guild downed anub our first night into naxx.
---
Lol, and people say I'm ignorant when I say ping and stability was an issue back in the day. No, no, obviously everyone had 300 fps and 20 ping.
---
You're being too nice - it's a luxury item, if someone can afford it they can afford a hefty 30-50g fee.
---
not a ninja.  all casters roll on that if it's an upgrade.
---
I love Western Plaguelands, the questing is amazing, the layout is great, especially for Alliance. The theme of the zone is so gloomy and well done, and the music is great.
---
You can't seriously think it's okay for them to roll on Dreadmist but not Devout...
---
Theres quite a few lbrs first 2 gems farm groups. Do that? It's fast and you'll get a bunch of attempts at first boss.
---
Dude for real. Makes me feel way better about my raid leading lol
---
Yes, but you said his autos were fire. Which is a lie.
---
Notice how my comment is "he hits for physical though, not fire damage." and not "don't stack fire resistance because you don't need it since his auto attacks are physical." 
---
Thanks for reminding me why I quit reddit last time around.
---
i guess its slightly better than an oeb, but not by a lot. the two rag 2h are still better by a long shot and mom is a different case since the damage is just on another level and even then its not much better than a dark edge. its hard to compensate for 5% crit or an extra attack.
---
 the person that posted a 500g item is actually dumb and is losing 5% for nothing when you could just sell it as fast on world chat for the same price and gain more.
---
i wouldn't reward the dumb/lazy person that posted the item instead of just using a sample macro to advertise on world chat but thats me.
---
Ok I understood yours and his points mate, I was disappointed at first but I was over it till he started whispering me and telling his "reasons" and being rude calling me names (more stuffs in the conversations that I didn't post because I just wanted to highlight the fact that he wanted it for the 4-set bonus which is spell damage..). And he could get better int and set bonus from the Magister's set with quests that only mages can complete to upgrade that tier set instead of letting a Priest uses the Devout set (which was an upgrade from what I had). But yeah, just ignorance and greed I guess :/
---
No it does not.  But chat logs does by default.
---
This is true.
---
For raids the most wanted class is Druids right now. Resto Druids.
---
Every Druid is meme spec.
---
It's a strange feeling. My life right now is perfect, I've never been happier. I spend more of my spare time doing physical exercise, yet I always have an itch to play a game, nothing seems to cure the itch like WoW does.

Satisfy your gaming itch with a little bit here and there but accept the fact you won’t be cutting edge, you won’t have the best gear, you might not even cap before the next raid release, you won’t have time to raid with a guild and will have to pug that content. But that doesn’t mean you won’t have fun, just enjoy the journey at your own pace. And keep exercising It’s a much healthier hobby.
---
Because IRL you usually can't just sit at your computer whenever you want and do a mindless task of your own choosing at your own convenience, to make real money.

/join LookingForGroup
---
It's a global chat channel that almost everyone in your server will be on when they're looking for a group. People don't normally advertise for groups in general chat because players of the appropriate level are gonna be all over the world, not just in the same zone as the instance and not just in cities.
---
Which one do you like? I like the bat or an owl.
---
Taste my steel!
---
Vael will test some guilds I think, but chrommag will be the first boss to test mister guilds.
---
I would say humar but the amount of humars named midnight is sickening.   Go with whatever you cant do wrong
---
You don't need an alt for that.
---
You just need to look for a Tailor in trade. Tailors are desperate for skillups that someone else pays for.
---
And, he;s a Leatherworker. You can make cheap greens cheaper out of leather, because leather isnt used for First Aid and rep turnins ...

I always use a cat 10-60, dash and high dmg, you really don't need a tanky pet imo
---
Wow amazing job! Was just going to start creating something like this for my Guild. I'll message with your requested info to use when I'm off work later! Again beautiful!
---
I can only imagine how disgusting the apple tank must be in Booty Bay. Alliance, Horde, Goblins, and swamp ass.
---
In my experience it is to try to stay one step ahead. Try to learn figure out what you would do in different situations. At a certain point it should feel like running a diagnostic of the situation at hand and going through the steps. Such as granting +move speed if you are slowed.
---
"Mmos before hoes" is about to have one of these.
---
Did they ever resolve that?  I haven't seen a winter squid in a long time.
---
Starving Mountain Lion is a 1.2 speed Cat available at 23. I’d just grab Needles Cougar (preferably a level 28 one) since you’re already level 28 so it’s not behind on levels, which is also a 1.2 speed Cat.
---
It's really not debatable. People have run the numbers hundreds of times over the years. Mana Igniting Cord provides more DPS than Sash of Whispered Secrets in every way for Warlocks. If your guild lets people simply roll on "upgrades" and has no priority system in place, you're once again in a bad guild. For instance, there's absolutely NO reason for Priests to roll on Aurastone Hammer (Shaman BIS) even though they're walking in to Molten Core with a blue main hand and off-hand. They have Benediction. For that same reason, Warlocks shouldn't be rolling on Sash of Whispered Secrets over a class that it is BIS for. Sure, if all your Warlocks have Ban'thok Sash and you have no Shadow Priest, go roll on it... Mana Igniting Cord is better though and there's no two ways about it.
---
Any “shitty” / “retail” / “pug shithead” Caster
---
Let’s fix that for ya.
---
If you don't die or OOM your healer, yes.
---
Mining uses ore.
---
I agree with the last sentence but I believe it's the same situation where hand of rag is on another level, till BWL is out anyways. 62 more top end is massive compared to BRE and there is no normalization so slow is king. Everything I'm saying I mean PvP wise..
---
yea i’m sorry man that is annoying af
---
Just use your mage as a gold farmer then. That’s really all I do. My realm guilds are taking 4-5 hours to clear mc and I just can’t dedicate that much time so I don’t raid. I just farm lashers, essences and selling tailoring items special patterns I have.
---
Clearly he mines. And that's all.
---
Watching this, I get the feeling nobody was really trying in this fight.
---
It takes you 10 hours a week to clear MC+ONY?
---
What addon are you using to see what totems your have active?
---
That was why I said I hadn't been turned away. MC has been pretty casual on my server.
---
Aren’t current day party/raid frames based on BfA?
---
I remember the vanilla frames being much shittier than they are now.
---
They are hidden, I used keybindings for most of my spells
---
I’m personally a big fan on wind serpent, lb is super nice
---
I do not understand how this works
---
Hope you're looking for work!
---
You should try another server, they’re all very different
---
I had the same issue a month ago, what a friend suggested to me was to go to the instance entrance ready to go and try to find people there. 
---
It sounds stupid, but on my server (Kurinnaxx) I had a real easy time getting multiple groups for WC just by hanging out at the actual dungeon entrance.
---
Go deep frost but put about 10-15 points into arcane for clearcast. It saves me so much mana
---
Honestly, I would stay BM. By now you already have Aimed Shot I would assume, so the rotation isn't going to be any different between MM and BM (other than having some pet cooldowns you can use in BM). Also, at low gear levels I think BM does pretty comparable damage to MM since your pet is always alive. Finally, if you ever do want to do questing or open world stuff, the combination of your pet doing less damage and you personally doing more damage means your pet will struggle to maintain threat and leave you kiting a lot more, which can slow things down and be annoying if you're used to sending your pet in and blowing up the target without problem.
---
Why! Gnoses are the filthiest out of em all....
---
already been done by 3 guilds on Incendius alliance alone, can't imagine how many have actually done it already you late.
---
Finding pure healing gear before BiS that is useful for paladins is actually quite difficult. So you aim for healing damage gear that usually has int or other stats on it as well. Yes. Damage doesn’t help with healing. But it does  help when doing solo content outside of dungeons and raids. 
---
Spell hit is useful for solo content as well for the same reason it is useful for other spell casters. It also slightly increases spell crit chance. Spell crit is one of the best stat for paladin healers. So of coarse if you can’t get a better stat set like direct spell crit. Spell hit won’t hurt to have.
---
I never said spell hit should be aimed for. But that doesn’t mean it has no use whatsoever for paladins. 
---
Off the top of my head the only stat a paladin should never have on any item is the various elemental spell damage items. Otherwise paladins get some sort of bonus small or large from every other possible stat available on items. It’s why some people like to joke about paladins needing all equipment almost on par with the ‘huntard’ loot jokes. And to a point there is truth to the jokes.
---
No it's actually the opposite. On alliance we bubble pally pull. Basically it's to prevent any 1 person from getting full aggro and dying so the locks+tanks can get their respective targets without extra adds
---
Sounds familiar. Reminds me of reading posts back on wowdetox.com
---
In your situation it doesn't sound like a good idea. You're barely into the grind and already your partner is noticing a change in you. Tread real carefully and keep your self awareness in check.
---
Though, I will mention that "revisiting the game" has potential to take less time than when we did it before, since we were spending so long just fooling around learning &amp; exploring. Now, things in your head are more streamlined and it's possible to log on, play a bit, and log out - while back in the day so many of us basically resided in the game. These days I feel like my time is mere wisely spent, which includes not logging on for indefinable playtime where I am there partly for escapism from my life.
---
Be aware of how you approach the game and be honest with yourself. I understand your perspective, just know yourself and reflect on both the good and bad memories you have - otherwise you may go down a similar path as before.
---

I’m not saying it makes sense...

Haha is that a fist weapon rogue !?
---
My server is still 20g for ring runs
---
What level are you currently?
---
This. This is the obvious solution.
---
What is that thing supposed to be hanging from top of their mouth anyway?
---
This isn't legit. 
---
You spent most of your time playing the AH game or have an alt who is all ready 60. Which isn't a big deal at all. Almost anyone can do that once they have a little bit of capital.
---
If it were legit, you'd have been 60 weeks ago, but you wouldn't had had your epic mount pre 60 either.
---
so i should keep brigam girldle and not use the crit ommoks and stack more hit then? thanks for ur help
---
or use both 1 set for  raiding and other for dungeon farm?
---
bc is the best of vanilla? huh? they are different games.
---
Fair enough. I had a pug that didn't care about debuffs clear up to Shazz and then dissolve after one attempt (probably could've made it work but it was late). Should be reasonable enough in phase 1 but I still don't want to be on the receiving end of someone's rant when Shadowfoot Stabber is so affordable.
---
totally agree.
---
Netfish and Grill
---
Spit macro... Alliance... Yeah that sounds about right...
---
Use an Alt for disenchanting things so you can get something like herbalism of skinning to make money
---
It depends. This is somewhat the case with a lot of people who play video games, get focused, and just don't want interruptions. When you don't have anything else going on or to focus on, it can be worse. 
---
It can be overcome with some small effort to break certain unfortunate habits and form new ones. 
---
Just take a hard look at yourself and see if you are actually falling back into old patterns. If yes, cancel. If not, give it time. It sounds like you've had enough practice being honest with yourself and making hard choices.
---
Its shit for both of you anyways so who cares?
---
You wait until they are finished killing and then steal their ore? You monster
---
To simplify it
---
Owls are great for world content like leveling
---
Cats are pretty much pure end game raid/pvp
---
They are the only two pets you need and you save the 3rd pet slot for learning new pet spells
---
On retail only yours makes a sound. On classic, anyone’s makes a sound.
---
You'd be surprised at how many guilds won't take you if it's perceived you play a weaker class.
---
Ideally it shouldn't matter, but more often than not, there are just that many bad guilds out their desperate to be relevant that they cut anything but the tops classes.
---
For every guild you're describing there is at least 2 other guilds that won't take you because you don't fit the fotm comp.
---
Actually interesting Jack O'Lantern idea, looks great!
---
Yeah, I didn’t burn through five years of heavy addiction to wow. 
---
Sometimes I wish I hadn’t.
---
What? Elitist jerks forums had all this figured out, I was using spreadsheets in AQ and Naxx to determine gear upgrades. People weren't as dumb as you think. Maybe for MC and BWL.
---
I believe you go to escape. System. Sound. Then turn off music and ambient sounds. Turn down dialogue. Crank game sounds way up.
---
This would be great advice if a boar’s charge actually interrupted.  But it doesn’t.
---
Back in BC I used to have to buy WoW cards from Walmart, and it was always a pain due to my poor spending habits. I kept it going because spending that $15 a month saved me MUCH more money each month.
---
Thanks for help use one of the most basic functions in the game. :)
---
They added that so you had to be good to smash people in PvP.
---
People caring about "world 500,000th+" kills on classic wow bosses amazes me. All of these firsts happened ~15 years ago with less gear, less information, less player power, etc.
---
The only thing i would suggest to you is that if you plan on being your guild raids spriest, make sure you have the time to go to all raid nights per week, theres only one spot for spriest in raids and its usually contested, but if you can make it to like 90% of all raid nights your guild will want you in that role.
---
wait... you could duel the other faction?!? oO
---
I’m not an expert on servers or anything but I’ve heard Faerlina can be a bad time due to all the streamers.
---
so you must know that this is the way it was back then, which people like you hated, so they "fixed" it. now youre fucking here repeating it.
---
Why is this so funny, ahaha
---
Fire doesnt work well on pve right now.
---
I’ve done progression raiding retail in a lot of top100NA guilds. Most of the time it isn’t yelling or acting dumb and shit. Once you’ve been up there in skill for awhile with friends in a guild you’ve been in for a long time everyone jives pretty well with each other.
---
I am a tank and I always take the misfits in my groups. Obviously wouldn’t stack them though
---
Please, assume more about people who work for minimum wage.
---
IMO, boars are the best pet for leveling because of Charge.  Your main goal as a hunter is to keep every mob at range so you can shoot it rather than melee.  Charge is the most effective ability to keep mobs from running to you.
---
An owl for leveling
---
A cat for group content and pvp
---
3rd open slot to take random animals for their pet abilities
---
Awesome thank you a ton. There were so many in the twitch app I didn’t really know which ones will be useful. I will install them tonight!
---
Only time we use CoW is on Golemagg's adds just to make it a little easier on the two tanking them.
---
in classic you can only have one skeleton corpse, so you don't get mass field of corpses after epic pvp events.
---
Guilds always break the average because they're a small sample size. I ran into a guild with 4 druids in a raid. I've never seen more than 2 in a raid before.
---
But the issue is you need 1/5 people to tank in 5 man and 1/20 to tank for raids. The couple encounters where every warrior throws on a shield isn't exactly "tanking".
---
My guild has been doing pugs for a month now, can't find a single one looking for a tank so my guildie can actually get tank gear.
---
What can I do to be a fire mage still ? If I understood what I was told we fire mages are useless in MC, and against too many mobs in places like bed and onwqrd. Yet AQ and Naxx seem to be fine fore a fire mage to shine. Am I gonna have to be frost until this phase hits ??
---
I wouldn’t just lie like that, I’ve tested. It’s just like a warriors charge in that sense.
---
R/lostredditors
---
Yep. They waaaaay over compensated the lag with the 0.4 batching.
---
Okay this is amazing
---
Are key bags in classic atm??
---
And some of us are slow as we have little play time due to work and family, but still slowly plugging away at it!
---
??? We’re talking about tipsout though. Not you.
---
A lot of servers have custom chat channels such as \/world or \/global join those as it’s not restricted to zones or cities.
---
For sure man, you are most welcome!

Haha funny meme. But it is quite easy to find a job. Even a pretty decent job. The harder part for most people is keeping it.
---
I do that every morning make a run and stock up on oily blacks and stanglekelp for the nextflix and faps.
---
Most of these forums threads are about toxic streamers.
---
How on earth these threads got popular I will never know.
---
Some garden gnome gets the attention of all these karma whores because they feel the need to be important.
---
Yet thousands of people upvote these trash threads anyways just to mob hate on these guys even though any decent person already knows this fact?
---
Why?
---
Of course you can. It’s a new start for you to enjoy wow. Put the reigns on your play time and enjoy it when you can. Be aware if your getting to invested into it. If your thinking more about wow than your family that could be troublesome. I think you have the self mastery to do it. Give it a shot and cut it if it’s not working out.
---
I miss everyone as soon as I look at YouTube
---
This is so much more in line with my experience back in the day, looks like you guys are having a ton of fun.
---
Outside of knowing your class and spec, along with other peoples and also the dungeons you are in, it's mostly just tryharding the rest. I think that voice communication helps a lot with a groups coordination of cooldowns and abilities. There are normally mobs you can skip and a place or two in each dungeon that allows you to drop mob aggro.  There's consumables to speed up the process, gearswapping for individual fights, and some other stuff as well.
---
You're just making it more challenging by bringing a hunter lol
---
Psh,  don't listen to them.  Leveling a rogue with a dagger spec will put hair on your chest/boobs or whatever.
---
100% by chance
---
Ready to ride!

Get the wolf from SFK. You are too low for broken tooth or the wolf from LBRS.

Felwood, Un'goro, Burning Steppes, Winterspring, WPL, EPL.

In roughly that order. Also Searing Gorge after Felwood if you haven't done it already
---

---
I still play with the UI scale cranked up so that the bar fits about 80% of the screen width, it just doesn't feel like vanilla without it
---
No, no it's really not worth it. It's exactly as you remember it and it's really just updates to a databse compared to your family that's yours right now. Learn from your experience and try to be the father you want to be.
---
I’m glad to hear people have fun with RBGs and still do them.. i thought they were totally dead, and most of the top arena pvpers don’t play them
---
You're being awfully offended there. You were wrong, and still are. Why would you value tps or the marginal dps so high, when ranged don't have to think about aggro whatsoever, and melee have to cyclically run in and out of melee range, whereas the tank does not. 
---
Making it so that unless you're a really shitty tank, you shouldn't lose aggro regardless.
---

Actually I installed an app from the App Store called easy res and lowered the build in screen to 1080p and am happily pegged at 60fps at 1080p on the big monitor with settings at 8. Disabling vsync lets it wander up in the 100fps range but that’s just extra work on the hardware for nothing.
---
Why does it matter your current spell power and Crit
---
Still better than 95% of posts put up on here
---
We don't, we just buy it and repost. Everyone wins.
---
Smart Hunter won't let you kill pet, will setup traps and eat out of combat and engage a paladin at range for ever. Equal skill Hunter wins in 15 minutes.
---
Play tank and make a group always work for me 100% of the time
---
I m almost sure that i read that hunts can also solo level in mara
---
Is it true? Am i crazy?
---
I think the Doomkin was more because they are beastly for pvp if you dont focus them.
---
Horde or Alliance? I've made a killing selling oily black mouth, fire fin and all the cloth. Well plus the rum. While firefins arent the same price as black mouth they sell for around 2g a stack at the right time of day. Now I'm stock piling for p2.
---
If you're struggling to clear try using more cc and kicks on casters. Make sure buffs are refreshed. Kill non elites and casters first on trash pulls, and focus adds first on bosses. It's all pretty straightforward from there once you get the hang of things.
---
I’d gladly (and do) use a Cat over an Owl for leveling. From Horde perspective you’d have to go completely out of your way to Westfall to get rank 1 screech or wait until 32 to get Carrion Bird from 1k Needles. You can obtain a 1.2 speed Cat at 23 without going out of a standard questing route. Just seems like a lot of trouble going out of your way to gimp your effective damage output. Cat can multi pull and chain pull with no problems it’s just going to do quite a bit more damage. You’re just outright underestimating Cat damage output. I’d highly recommend getting a Bloodaxe Worg at 56+ for any group content with melee.
---
Yep, I remember doing it all the time. just type /duel.
---
But then they'd have to farm retail.
---
It's better to go 6-7 pts in shadow for spirit tap + less resists then dump points into disc (survival) or holy (damage). 
---
There's a lot of pretty lame talents in Shadow that will kinda waste your points early on, of course it becomes worth it once you can reach shadowform.
---
I played tycoon with wildvine on my server. I would buy everyone I saw listed then relist for about 2.5g to 5g per plant. It worked for about 2 weeks until more people started hitting purple lotus zones but I was able to get about 300g during that time just from wildvine with minimal effort.
---
Had its charm, gotta say (wouldn't want it now tho).
---
How hard is it to get a voice to text app and run it overlayed in a separate screen or over your game screen ?
---
At some point disabled individuals need to be proactive , on their own, to overcome obstacles that the disability puts in your way.
---
been 60 for 2 weeks searching for a guild prebisd up as a hunter no one wants 1
---
Hunters and are actually pretty populated, it's not easy to get a spot in a raid. The thing is you only want to be taking a few to each raid so naturally they can gear up easier IF you have a spot.  Likewise for druids, though there are way fewer so it's a little easier to find a spot.
---
The Who list is also a good resource, can search by zone, level, and class. Then whisper people that may be interested.
---
Cat.
---
I disagree with the cast time vs mana reduction.  Most shamans are going to be spamming Chain Heal a LOT more than Healing Wave, and if you need quick heals you’re often using Lesser Healing Wave anyways.
---
Maybe full t8 tanks cast Healing Wave enough to justify the cast time reduction, i suppose.
---
I wish I was in your guild holy shit this is awesome
---
Indeed. Now the first thing people ask is "how long to max level?" and "when can I raid?". I didn't have my first experience with WoW, but other games around a similar sort of time.
---
Bad mojo creepy crawly being severe lag and disconnects and server crashes, sure heh
---
thanks i hate it
---
maybe if you are a 15 year wow nerd veteran, but for the rest of the people who dont play 16 hours a day, no.
---
where did you fished?
---
I'ma take your advice and stay away then! ;D
---
I'd rather bob after a Dwarf than a Night Elf with a stuck up attitude.
---
I’ve raided 30/0/21 more than a dozen times so far in Classic and not once have I ever caught any flak for not having mana tide.  Usually I even mention that I don’t have it so they should put me in a melee group.
---
And get them to show up once they get what they want or you hit a wall. I mean at a certain point guilds were still trying to get clear mc,bwl,zg,aq20, and then aq40 once a week or so. That's when a mass Exodus happened.
---
It’s be ok if the new blizzard was capable of incorporating good changes instead of constantly shitting out bad ones. 
---
In the end, no changes is the best we can hope for.

Because that's why we play, for fun. Tbh my most enjoyable raid in retail was when one of our healer had to go afk and we had to wait(we had a small group so we can't if someone missed) after the healer arrived the tank left because had to do something. So we spend 2 hour in the raid literally did nothing just talk, joking and had fun. Some times if someone went for some snack or drink, we just sneak pulled the boss on him and things like that. That raid was more memorable then an end boss kill or an upgrade loot.
---
I’m clearly referring to the classic hate circle jerk that exists on r/wow
---
Where do you go after 52?
---
Just going to throw out my perspective as a healer. I strongly prefer tanks with two handers most of the time. There are times when a shield helps but for the most part the 2h tanks deal more damage and generate more threat. This means mobs die faster costing me less mana, and dps are less likely to draw aggro and waste mana. Being too tanky is actually not a good thing in easier content because it leads to rage starvation. You need to take damage to hold aggro.
---
I have a deaf guy in my guild who's part of the core raid group. We just type to him what we need him to do in private. It works out just fine. Anyone who who says not possible are just lazy and quite literally selfish.
---
You can heal any dungeon and raid as shadow skilled priest. Especially if you get yourself a healing set.
---
Tough read. If I was a raid lead, I'd go out of my way to accommodate a person with a disability into the raid team, ESPECIALLY if he/she knows tacs.
---
it is lol. 75% resist at 315 FR. done after that.
---
Some people don't actually want to do that, he just wanted to take advantage of what he had available and play the game he is enjoying more.
---
Well done
---
Happy cake day
---
30/0/21 is awesome for all endgame content right now, and is also THE shaman pvp spec.  Just don’t expect to do much dps in raids unless you go all out with consumables.
---
I was nowhere near the melee group, I was far enough away, but just in range for them to get totems, so again, it wasn't me.
---
considering the only current PvP is dueling now I'd say mace spec is on par with axe, 3 second stun on a different DR than charge/intercept should not be underestimated. 
---
Sulfuras being bad is just propaganda from shamans/paladins tbh
---
Even better, people trying to race to get firsts with different bullshit circumstances miss the whole point of classic. I'll still being enjoying classic at my own pace while these idiots burn themselves out in a few months. (Probably not because, streamer)
---
Here is a thought. 
---
Why not have your buddy join discord so the Raid leaders can see he is in there....Then do what ever you were going to do to help him anyways...
---
Why the hell do you need to ask the raid leader permission? Fuck that just do what y’all need to do and raid fuck anyone else’s opinion on the matter.
---
Mines called Pantherion....
---
Exactly this.
---
Since MC and BWL mobs have either really high fire resistance or full immunity, going fire is not possible before ZG drops. 
---
So you will need to wait until phase 3 until you switch to fire unfortunately.
---
Do the pat with the 2 hyenas ever walk by you over there or do they not pull since you're on the rock?
---
I just don't buy this. Bad guilds didn't clear content back then besides MC maybe a year after it was out. There were very few guilds who cleared raids let alone Naxx. If it was SOOOOOO easy why did less than 1% of raiding guilds actually clear it?
---
in phase two people will be farming honor. He will be within the honor range for some people. They will kill him for honor. Then some.
---
I really wish you could save half typed messages in a buffer in case you need to interact with the world suddenly.
---
A mediocre geared tank only takes like 700 damage per second on rag. Your healers are already in position prior to pull. If tank dies on pull then he slacked in rag gear or healers sleeping.
---
its pretty simple. stuns don't give rage, crits and extra attacks do.
---
That is all correct but you forgot a crucial point: Your math does not check out. If you don't pull 500tps for ranged doing 500dps, they eventually get over 130% or they have to keep stop dps'ing. It will only stay 130% if you make similar tps.
---
What you also did not factor in: misses (when you don't have 9% hit in tank gear) and much more annoying parries and dodges. Getting a miss/parry/dodge yields you zero threat. Bosses parry for 14% and dodge for 6%. That alone makes 20% less threat. Most tanks aren't anywhere close to their hitcap. With zero hitchance that makes a total threat reduction of 29%.

Could use some Druid advice please.  Level 48 mostly feral dps talents for leveling, planning on maybe doing a respec at 60. My question is why do i feel like so many of my attacks miss, get blocked,  or parried by mobs. Noticed it around mid 30s i wanna say and it's really frustrating. All of my gear prioritizes Agi, str, and stam and i keep it fairly updated as i level. I read that weapon skill is irrelevant in shapeshift form so my weapon skills have stayed pretty low. I  try to mostly do quests same level as me +/- 1 or 2 levels. When fighting mobs my same level i really feel i like i miss more than 30% of my white attacks and claw, ferocious bite, rake etc. Is this just kinda common? I know at higher levels feral wants to reach 9% hit before prioritizing other stats but at lower levels is there anything i can do to land more attacks?
---
brd
---
This made me think of a survival hunter with trap talents has a place in a cleave group, maybe with a gorilla pet?
---
Relax, not everyone wants to play a gnome warrior. You can still pvp regardless.
---
Why so defensive?
---
Meh I dont think your, or an anyone  else's, opinion on what the "point of classic" is carries any weight beyond you. They can want to race to weird goals if they want, I just dont have to be impressed by the world first left handed players only rag kill in classic. Especially  since there was probably  already a left handed player only rag kill 15

AoE farming is mind numbingly easy. You just have to understand how to strafe and hold distance after cone of cold, how to abuse rank 1 arcane explosion for clearcast procs, and how to deal with mobs that resist your initial nova.
---
Not hard at all, just look up a guide and spend 2-3 hours trying to improve and you should be able to get it down unless you're a potato. 🥔 🥔 🥔
---
Meh, there were alot of benefits to having access to PvE gear in arenas tbh. Stormherald in S2 and rogues with twin blades pop to mind.  
---
I remember boosting people to shoulders so that I could get invited to their raids just to get a small advantage in arenas.
---
Words can't express how boring frost is for me. It's not a spec I will ever ever play. 
---
I'm never the type to limit myself to a single playstyle. But for mages as a class, i only liked fire. During wrath I was arcane and it was garbage for me. I performed well but wasn't enjoying it at all. 
---
I could go on for days and days about how much fun i had as fire. During tbc especially. 
---
Melt all the faces. I could kill 2 twinks vs 1 me. I mage tanked from 30 to 60 waaay too often. And I could quest with ease.

Druids are viable. Not as good as warriors in every scenario but pretty damn good.

Yay an entertainment thread!
---
It's interesting you consider Dark Edge to be good even though it's basically an axe with mace spec included. Why would mace spec be bad anyways?
---
PvP gear was only better in PvP, as it should be. It also had some sick trinkets and weapons that straight up beat any glad weaponry. Was a perfect balance and PvPers weren't forced to raid but could do it to get a small edge in PvP.
---
number of mobs per pull is kind of a useless metric.  
---
AoE spells become viable DPM at 4+ mobs. But being able to pull and aoe ten mobs at once is kinda pointless if you can only do one of those pulls until they respawn.
---

Elitism when it comes to a games difficulty is pretty sad. Why not let people just enjoy it? If they think it’s difficult maybe it is to them...

Decided to knock out the Onyxia attunement quests this morning, and with that same group we formed a group of 40 to take down Onyxia. Not only was it a great experience, but i also got a sweet tier 2 helm out of it. Best. Day. Ever.

They are master at stealth. Have you ever seen one? Me neither.

But as with lies, there's always a bit of truth of buried in there. Self-projection can take form in a comparable situation.
---
For example, Im not saying that he is 14 and unable to pay wow because he is self-projecting. But he could be in a comparable economic situation where 15$ feels a lot more than just 15$.
---
Im not saying anything of this is true, merely trying to explain the psychology behind self-projection on a simple level.
---
Only reason that chest should go for a priest is for completing the set and even that is a mediocre reason. Devout isnt a good set for priests, most of the T0 sets are pretty bad for the classes as itemization was garbage when they were introduced.

I prefer the dope loot i got from dungeons and raids be viable in pvp. A pvp specific stat is stupid to me.

That is true, the middle of the bell curve has definitely shifted towards minmaxing (this is across all multiplayer games really, or just my own bias). I guess it's human nature to try to be the best you can, even if it runs the risk of sucking the fun out of the game
---
BRD is 52-59.  
---
But in rest it's almost impossible to get if you are not 60.

Maybe if you are 58+ ...

I do this all the time...  especially at level 54 where I am now.  There are quests spread across probably 6-7 zones or more.  I am trying to do them somewhat in order by level so it’s a great way to plan.
---
Legit wouldn't bother me, I don't notice fonts like most people.
---
Amazing
---
I disagree. The amount of hours you have to spend doing something you actually dislike, just to compete with the people who happen to enjoy raiding, is not what makes a healthy game.
---
&gt; you won't take any damage.
---
lmao, that's not true at all. you can still get 1clapped out of block, and/or die to the bleed stacks they put on you.
---
Yes GM, this Dwarf right here.
---
well it was a pug so everyone rolled on this
---
They don't need to express there opinions when they're playing the game and enjoying it, the minority is always the loudest as they say.
---
I totally agree. Frost isn't wildly interesting when it comes to things that don't get Frostbite/Shatter combo. Fire is definitely a lot more interactive. Our time will come in AQ
---
Yeah.  Played private servers for like 4 years.  Calling it vanilla is just habit now.
---
They asked you for help, then rolled against you on the drop, and they still expect a split? Fuck that shit, keep all the money. Poor etiquette from then
---
It's alright depending on race, sure

How many people do you know using their class dungeon set?  It's complete garbage compared to the alternatives.  I remember actually building that set in vanilla, because it was reasonable pre raid gear back then.  The catch up gear and talent changes alone trivialize this tier of content.
---
You could filter them without addon.  
---
Just create new chat tab and remove /4 from your General chat.
---
Absolutely barbaric
---
Just join discord and have your friend say he doesn’t have a mike.  If someone in the raid says something to him, type that statement out for your friend.  If  this works and your friend does fine in raids, great.  If the raid leader finds out and boots your friend, post the guild/raid leaders name and Reddit will shame him into taking your friend back.
---
its because you pick pocketed the mob but didnt take the loot, so now the mobs has loot in it, so you can pick pocket him again to get the loot
---
Not hiding much.
---
Make your own groups then or find a different one. Ret paladins might not have optimal DPS but damn do they have some strong utility. Uber buffs, rez, DI, bubble, off heals and off tank all as ret. If we are talking stereotype, I’d rather have a ret paladin than a hunter that breaks my CC all the time because they mash multi shot.
---
I have 30 spellpower enchant people won't pay more then 10g for it... You must be on a low pop server with very few people who have it.

No. You have a very strong misunderstanding of paladins and priority and what is beneficial.

I sell Crusader eaisly for 20g fees and raid enchants for 50g fees.
---
Some wont pay but the majority doesnt Blink an Eye. 
---
Sorry guys, I understand that's hard to understand and believe, specially when I see people spending hours grinding for 30/50g per HOUR LUL
---
I found the last part to not be true as long as you were deep prot.
---
Baddie DPS can go balls to the wall, not heeding marks and general group consideration and your improved revenge, improved taunt, shield slam and concussion blow makes an abyssmal run as arms into a smooth sailing piece of cake as prot.
---
I was prot from lvl 58 to full fury preBiS and maybe 40% prot preBiS. The problem with bad DPS is that the first 10 seconds of each fight is the crucial time in which it is determined if the fury will hold aggro.
---
Getting hit while zerker rage is up and you get 50 rage fast in defstance is mandatory. Having a rogue stand between you and your pull targets blasting blade flurry makes tanking for the rest of the fight pretty much impossible or at the very least quite aggravating and unfun.
---
As prot you stun one with imp revenge every 6seconds with 45% chance and concussion blow the 2nd, taunt one, build huge amounts of aggro with 20rage shield slam, stun the blowed one again with revenge and have aggro on him too.
---
This all allows a prot warrior to carry the most repugnant array of baddie DPS while smooth sailing.
---
I probably wouldn't have had fun tanking to my preBiS without all these fail-safe switches built into the prot spec to carry.
---
&gt; I can definitely see how someone who lacks the mental wavelength to write out “to be honest”, would have a hard time understanding simple economics.
---
since you lack the mental wavelength to write out auction house, why should anyone here take you serious? you are such a stupid person!
---
No. There will still be people ganking greys but now also there will be people farming honor
---
From alliance point of view of discord recruitment, people always seem to need paladins and druids. I’ve even seen a couple spots for boomkin believe it or not.
---
Whatever you do, stay the f away from mage. Everyone and their mom has rolled mage.
---
I am going to give a little advice on maxing DPS in Mc/Onyxia as well as answer your PS question on fire resistance.
---
I would recommend being diligent with ice barrier and fire ward. Combine this with first aid, and your own health pots you should have constant frost bolt uptime. Our guild hands out greater fire protection pots as well as being in close proximity of a pally fire resistant buff. 
---
In terms of mana use, for the first phase of Rag you should be utilizing max rank frost bolt. Mana pot and mana gem when necessary to get that cd going. Main thing here is too evocation before phase 2 comes as you will be needed to AoE. Once Rag emerges max rank until you are around 20%mana and then use the mages advice below and start using rank 5. 
---
I just have advice for Rag as the rest of MC you shouldn’t have an mana issues and you aren’t really needed as much. Onyxia will die wayyy before you pop  cooldowns. If you do what I say above fire resistance does not become that needed.
---
I want to join your guild.
---
WoW banner is to the right of it, this one's gotta be WC3.
---
Fury warrior. You can still tank all 60 content (other than raids) so it’s super easy to find a group to gather your pre raid bis gear. Then you do top tier DPS in the raid as fury spec.
---
You'll be hard pressed to find a better weapon than this at that level accounting in for autoattack damage. It deals 27 less damage with Mortal Strike than the hammer from Princess Theradras. 27 out of ~350 damage is fucking nothing.
---
Wrong. The percentages do not change. If you do 350 TPS for 100 seconds, you put out 35,000 threat. DPS does 500 DPS for 100 seconds, they put out 50,000 threat. That is still 70%. This is math 101.
---
Miss/dodge/parry were not factored in because "auto attack and Sunder" is literally the most basic threat rotation I could come up with. A fresh 60 Arms Warrior can put out that threat. Put a Prot tank in there with gear, consumables, actually using all of their abilities, etc... That more than makes up for any dodges/misses/parries.
---
That is the plan. I have been building my friends list while leveling and that should help fill the roster. 
---
Around 30 I started a 20+ person raid to help counter and control hillsbrad at the crossroads. It was super fun. Everyone saying there is no reward for it without phase two are not playing for community, just personal gain.
---
I have that one too. I just posted this on my cell tho lol
---
1. Every guild is different that's like asking what the etiquette is for rolling on BoE epics in a 5 man everyone has a different opinion.
---
2. Again totally dependant on guilds some do a dkp decay other do a reset some leave it as it is.
---
If you can please Reach out to End game officer and we will be Removeing this guy as soon as possible. i have no idea who it is. If you dont bring it to our attention we can not handle the problem. Just message any officer in game
---
You're toxic.
---
Don't roll pvp if you can't handle 20 v 1. Roll pve and just duel.
---
MC took like 5-6 days from release of classic. Was launched on a Monday and Rag was down by Saturday
---
If only it was as good as it looks!
---
Yeah, as someone who did arenas later in wow, pve great dominance would have sucked. It somehow fits wow classic, just not retaik
---
That would be great if some of the PVP gear wasn't better than PVE gear. Some players will never be good enough to compete in PVP, it's simply too fast paced and requires more class knowledge and lateral thinking than most players will ever be able to absorb.
---
The game was definitely design for players to have a more narrow field of view than they do now.
---
Nope, you can just do it over and over, refreshing it as you go.
---
&gt; Calm down Sanstan
---
Exactly, and OP can write to him if he needs to do something.
---
What did you do for network access?
---
Just buy dust off the AH. If there was a way to get it cheaper, everyone would be doing that for profit.
---
No, unless the mobs are flagged you can't interact with them.
---
Yeah that’s what I meant to say.
---
Its not about the damage its about the cast time
---
do it
---
Try the print screen button.
---
This reminds me of my guild tbh
---
Your gear is looking a little bare bones
---
Try it out for yourself.
---
I could never level with a cat the way I did with a boar. The charge and root were just too good for me because I want my pet to actualy hold aggro most of the time and that root worked wonders for keeping mobs away for that extra second.
---
I also like my pet to be more of a tank for me than a dps stick.
---
58+ for everything that isn't lbrs or brd. You can do these dungeons at lower levels but as a rogue I don't see any reason why a group would take you over a higher level player.
---
But the other faction can attack them. Bummer.
---
Vegetarian Magician
---
Yeah, they fixed it after a few weeks.
---
Good. Also you won't get a refund
---
Amazing details! Thanks. By the way, do you know any non intrusive simple plugin to show the names of what the enemy is doing, for both instant and non instant casts? So I can associate them with their effects. Reading the damage log isn't very interactive
---
This is what I did. According to details my rank 4 mind Flay spam does about 2-3 more dps then my current wand except it drains my mana so even at 52 I'm still wanding when I don't want to waste all my water
---
Day1.  With the way phases roll out, should have half the raid in bisp4 gear by p6.
---
The biggest guilds have enough geared tanks to poach from.
---
it surely cant be 10 hours in MC. I am in a small guild and we pug it every week and they usually only take 3 hours
---
Check your raid IDs if it says your saved to an mc your saved and are fucked if theres no mc Id you good to join a new one.
---
I currently hold the world record dps on rag... i usually only use one, but i wouldnt even normally need that nor fireward... the trick is positioning. There is a “secret spot” in rags room where you are least likely to get hit with raid mechanics, it is up on a wall right behind where the tanks are. Give it a try!
---
I got the Fiery Blaze Enchanment quest reward from the Badlands. A friend is leveling a pally and is about to get his lvl 20 class quest mace. Would it be a good idea to slap this on his mace? Im a warlock so I have no use for it other than maybe using it on a white weapon for low lvl toons but I dont really have an interest in playing a melee class. Another question about this item, does it replace your weapon dmg when it procs? Wowhead had a comment saying it does but I feel like that would make this enchanment utterly useless because why would anyone want to replace an attack with a paltry 15dmg.
---

Basically this. If there is a demand why not make gold off of it. if I have 4-5 groups that want me to tank a run and one of those groups will pay me gold as well as res the item I need from that dungeon it's a no brainer which group I'm going to tank for.
---
Bri I would charge maximum price. Unless you got your epic mount and you don't care about gold. Your call really. Top comment says 40g what's stopping you from going 50 or 60? Lol if nobody buys then slowly lower the price untill they do
---
Dreadmist EU
---
Onyxia head has items for every class it's just arguably better for tanks and melee dps. And you can say it's uncommon but you would be wrong
---
That it’s straight up wrong. 140k is probably around 4-500g in Classic. Very doable in a month, certainly not in 15 mins.
---
&gt; shadowmelted
---
I levelled a Prot tank in instances from level 13 (RFC) onwards, and am level 45 now.  I'm getting sick of it, for three main reasons.
---
a}  Pug DPS almost always treat both tanks and healers like dirt.  The only thing 90% of them care about is their place on the DPS meter, and they view anyone whose role is not directly concerned with damage, with contempt.  They don't wait for healer mana, and they pull before I do, which often leads to two seperate mobs being pulled, and the group being endangered as a result due to un-planned for adds.
---
In social terms, Rogues and Hunters are very consistently the two most unpleasant classes in this game, in my experience; and it has reached a point where I will only tank for members of either of those classes, if they are either a} played as alts by someone who I have otherwise played with before and know to be trustworthy, or b} are introduced to me with a positive reference by someone else I trust.
---
b}  Elitism is the only incentive which a lot of people have for playing this game, ***ESPECIALLY*** the DPS classes.  I won't say that absolutely everyone suffers from the disease, but far too many people do.  Content is exclusively viewed as a means by which people can obtain something which no one else (or very few other people) has, (whether world first kills, raid gear, a certain type of mount etc) and then use that as an excuse for viewing themselves as superior to others.
---
c}  I am tired of constantly being given shit for the fact that I want to be 31 point Protection, with a sword and shield, because I care about avoiding wipes and not putting unnecessary stress on my healers.
---
My point is, that however you get to 60, if you want to actually enjoy the experience, I don't recommend tanking for pugs.  If you want to tank, find a guild with mature, intelligent people, and tank for them and for them alone.
---
Great video hahaha
---
Like I said then you must be on a low pop server where not many people have the enchants. First month yes you could get 50g for spell power enchant now that 50-100 people on the sever have it the price plummets. Just like lionheart helm first person to get it can craft it for 200g when 50 people have it your lucky to get 50g.
---
Is this Pertento K3?
---
If you're dead it won't be placed in your inventory. This happens all the time and is working as intended.
---
Except p3 is bwl which is bad for fire still
---
I'm confused too, BG's are live?!
---
Had this happen with runn tum tuber recipe, had to manually loot after I win the roll
---
By uncommon I mean the alternative loot system definitely happens more. Don't get so hung up on terminology.
---
Edit; OP also said he doesn't need it, hence selling and not using it like you talk about.
---
Buddy mage friend did lbrs 53 times, dropped 5 times total. First 4 he lost the rolls to mages/priests who weren't even high enough level to use. Then he finally got one on run 53. 
---
I got it first run, still don't know star though...
---
If your too far away from the body when rolling you don't get the loot. Simple. GG
---
searing gorge, feralas, un goro, hinterlands, felwood, western plaguelands, azshara, burning steppes,

---
I don't play retail, don't want to play retail, so might as well use the goods ive earned to allow me to play something I DO want to play? Eh?
---
Happens to me sometimes, I win a roll, not far from mob.
---
Still have to pick it up
---
OP find help. This has been done problem a dozen or more times since the release of classic
---
We have one person who is hard of hearing in our raid, one more who is fully deaf. One of our leads just whispers important stuff. Never been a big deal. If a guild isn't willing to work with you then they probably aren't a good guild to be joining
---
Bad player killing other bad players ugh
---
Um, ok.
---
This guy thinks that because those Tier 0 sets have a thematically "intended" or "suggested" class somebody who wants to go with something other than the intended/suggested usage is automatically a ninja.
---
Yeah fpr sure, maybe it came across as If I dont find groups, that is not the case. Just that sometimes I get denied an invite solely on the basis of ”meme spec lul must be bad”.
---
Lmao paladins are a joke and easy to kill as a mage , I’d dunk on you
---
This is the guild I'm in and man was totally caught off guard seeing this post. Was like hey I know these guys and Shaun is totally the type to run into the tree. That damn clicky clacker.

You solo level brd at 52?
---
Why are you bothered by one of the OG Warcraft 2 and 3 Horde races being a playable horde race?
---
Believe it or not, harder raids are coming, many raids will be spending 5 hour nights. Also general farming and preparation.
---
Fun? In wow? No changes. Period.
---
Thanks, I hate it!
---
If they're not planning to get the UBRS buff, 300 FR buffed is fine and could ideally get up to 315.
---
UBRS buff is annoying to get, so it's better if it's not needed.
---
I wasn't dead.
---
Should I replace the quests by just aoe grinding?
---
Priest you only need to upgrade the wand every chance you get. Other than that just pick up quest gear or random drops with int and spirit.
---
It’s nothing in comparison to that but 18-20 hours a day is completely unhealthy. Your brain can’t function properly when you only sleep 4 hours a day, and I know it’s hard but you can’t justify your current habits by comparing them to absolutely ridiculous old habits. That’s an excuse and excuses get you addicted again.
---
Every pug I have ever been in has been free rolls it's the default pug raid loot system on my server. And again just because he sold it doesn't mean he couldn't have used it, he just valued the gold over the ring it gives... Just like the backpack every class can use it but it gets sold by the winner all the time because they value 300g over 2 extra bag slots.
---
Honey, I can MORE than afford the game. I just don't play retail anymore, so might as well make the gold do something, eh?
---
Wasn't too far from the boss either, I was tanking it.
---
How so?
---
Owl is a very good choice for the screech AoE, but yeah honestly hunter is great for cleave but nobody knows it. The first time I went with my brother in a cleave grp (he's a mage) it blew his mind how much easier it was to AoE and kite the mobs with traps.
---
You can’t, no longer an option.
---
Dont want to be rude, but just join the discord, I get it he will not hear them but you can cooperate with him, if he have just to listen you can make some macros so you can spam him with commands from raid leader etc.
---
Yes the cleave bounces to the next target and vise versa, same with WW if u WW 4 mobs you hit then all twice. Providing you have enough SS charges.
---
Rip. Glitch.
---
You couldn't pay me to play retail.
---
Is the Forsaken Courier in Arathi Highlands bugged? I ran all the way to the farm from Tarren Mill and waited for 30 minutes without seeing it.
---
How about pvp gear not being possible to use in raids then. Then it really doesn't matter. Could go both ways to be honest.
---
Is incendius the dark horse? Quietly claiming records without bragging?
---
Yeah we did. With a little effort it was easy to find all the spreadsheets for any class and "Best in slot" was a very known term.
---
Serious progression guilds gave a lot of shit about these things so just because you didn't hear about these things it doesn't mean that everybody was clueless or didn't care.
---
Look into this, apparently this one was designed to be clear reading:  [https://www.dyslexiefont.com/en/typeface/](https://www.dyslexiefont.com/en/typeface/)
---
But my whole point is why let people roll on something they only want to sell and not use? My question was for OP not all pug raid players..
---
Most people view that as being a ninja, as you're taking loot away from others they want to use just so you can gain gold.
---
Who's the second tank, and how much FR do they have?
---
If you don't have a second geared tank, you'll need 315 FR so that you can resist the knockback 100%. Otherwise you'll get knocked back, tank #2 will get nuked, and the raid will wipe.
---
If tank #2 also has 270-300 FR, then you're fine at 300.
---
Your dps have to pay attention.
---
I don't think we have a totem does that, it's probably "purge" which is an instant cast dispel.
---
A crap loot policy for this pug would make me look for another pug unless it’s monday night.
---
Level 60 warrior here. 
---
This is going to sound arrogant, but I did about 99% dungeon levelling as Fury/Prot, and it was easy. 
---
**31/20 google Skarmbrena fury/prot**
---
It's better than full prot. You become a DPS class, while you are tanking. 
---
The only time I really stepped out of dungeons between 30 and 60 was to do the elite quests in hinterlands.
---
What I can tell you is this - from 50-53 I grinded Sunken temple 
---
From 53-55 I grinded BRD Anger/Arena runs
---
55-60 I grinded LBRS (lbrs very good xp)
---
This was also 99.9% Pugs only. 
---
It's possible as long as you can take control of the pug and are confident in your ability to lead (which a warrior should). I would mark myself with a Pink Diamond so everyone knows who's in charge. ;)
---
From a healers perspective, in pugs I never go oom because I don’t know the group, and I don’t know what idiotic thing the dps or tank is going to do. More mana = oh shit button and I can usually carry a group on a bad pull or mistake.
---
People certainly weren't BiS list following zombies back then, but we knew mechanics, consumables, world buffs and optimal specs and boss strategies, as well as things like hit tables (def/hit cap, crushing blow avoidance). Yeah the info wasn't readily available but it was out there and progression guilds knew a lot more about the game than people like to pretend they did on this subreddit.
---
Wiped in ST, everyone running back, next thing I know party is like ???, I hadn’t been paying attention and ran to the sea
---
Go to youtube and type warlock solo dm east farm. It's 100% possible and honestly not that difficult. And its done for gold not gear...
---
That's up to you but you know where you stand now.
---
Well as I said, I don't recommend taking that spec to raid, at least not until you have some good healing gear. For dungeons though, you are casting a lot of healing wave.
---
DPS warrior is a highly valued role as well. So a dps warrior that is willing to tank (without being to be browbeat into it) is probably one of most, if not *the* most, valued by most guilds.
---
Go to a major city and beg 60s for a gold
---
I know but it is more funnier and safer with friend, so I desided to publish video. :D
---
Honestly the amount of time it takes to set up the auctions with the amount of greens you get combined with the poor sales rate (I think because every mage is selling lvl 40 greens from zf), more efficient to just vendor and do more zf runs lol
---
most screens were still 4:3 back then
---
sounds like you don't know the spot
---
If you're planning on being a pve instance jockey, then I would definitely go with a Priest.  They might have virtually no versatility in other areas, but as you say, they're hands down the best healers in the game.
---
Shamans are very welcome in 5 mans due to their totems, as well as their extra survivability compared with Priests; and they can very easily double as DPS in a pinch.
---
I don't recommend Druids for anything other than farming alts, personally; although they do have a number of advantages for that role.  Friendly/casual guilds will permit you to raid with a Druid, but core/sociopathic elitist guilds will not.
---
If you want PvP, none of the above.  I would suggest a Rogue or Hunter.
---
Raz was easier than Anub I think.  Guild I was in downed Raz after like 4 attempts and spent the rest of the week wiping on Anub and then broke.
---
This is a non issue. Just join the discord... they don’t need to know anyone is deaf. Besides you said he knows the strat, just join discord and get going.
---
A ‘human’ priest killed me in Tirisfal Glades as I was running to SM. I didn’t know if they were MC’d and then forced to attack me but then I realized the disguise. Damn you Hipie (on Anathema).
---
Worth it for what? Gold? Xp? Gear? Consumables?
---
Just looking at the screenshot it's obvious they were though.  Look at the rogues with Claw of the Black Drake MH w/ Sword OH.
---
speaking as an oceanic player, before oceanic severs.... yes ping was an issue
---
Widescreens (16:9 etc) were not the norm. 4:3 were. It is one of the reasons CS 1.6 players prefer 4:3 in CS:S and CS:GO, as it was what they played on back then
---
Carry on tea boy
---
Exactly.... The bomb taggs them to the person who is the mobs levels..  not the 60, the 60 body pulls
---
Used to be a female nightelf warrior, now in classic a female orc warrior and hunter. And I'm very much a hairy, burly dude. I just prefer the looks and animations.
---
Hey, thanks for a detailed response :) 
---
I’m not struggling to clear, but sometimes the group does great and sometimes it does absolutely shit and I just want to pin down what it is. 
---
Do you always focus adds first? Most I can think of it’s pretty much nuke the boss? What’s the best way to know which to do? Or never just nuke the boss? 
---
And any advice on things like LoS-Ing? Things that go wrong with los etc? 
---
Thanks
---
Why would you downgrade it? The only reason to downgrade it would be if your oom so it might be worth it to keep level one on an action bar but I wouldn't use it often at all.
---
Ahh damn that's funny, thanks.
---
If you hit instance cap it will port you elsewhere
---
It’s on our disc already lol they had a hoot
---
Free for all loot in naxx? Oh thats bold.
---
He meant downranked not nerfed fyi.
---
not best at pvp
---
Just let them know your friend is deaf
---
It looks like he is  multi boxing them all at the same time. So maybe excessive, but much less than it looks.
---
&gt; mmorpgs are supposed to be living breathing worlds and you're paying a sub to boot
---
That's what retail is for
---
You just posted a multibox user. Third party programs to control the character, this is against Blizzard's terms of agreement and needs to be reported.
---
I mean I solo it as a lock so I'd assume the 2 of you can do it. It probably will be slow as shit and inefficient but doable.
---
Sometimes you have to skip quests and move on to another area. Your character isn’t ruined. A naked hunter with a bow and a pet can kill things their own level, you’re fine.
---
I've had deaf people join raids. We had one doing mekkatorque heroic without to much trouble and that is the worst fight for deaf people I could imagine. If that leader said no just ask another one.
---
This. I feel most people don’t realize this.
---
Devout/Dreadmist/Magisters are absolute garbage. As a fresh 60, you should already be sporting a Dreamweave Vest, which gives int, spirit, and spell damage. It’s dirt cheap (a couple of gold), and will tide you over until you can get an actually good chest from dungeons or tailoring.
---
unironically this tho
---
The sad reality of 40man raids where you had guild members quitting over being benched if there were too many raiders or barely scraping by and inviting randoms into the raid or raiding with 32-35 people.
---
Many guilds had to constantly go back 2 tiers and gear up fresh 60s or they had new players joining from MC/BWL guilds that fell apart.
---
One of the main reasons why Blizzard switched to 25man raiding in TBC and never looked back.
---
A lot of the gear in MC and Ony are crap compared to blue dungeon gear. So DKP hoarding is perfectly fine right now since it won’t hurt progression. That being said I would rather be in the position of spending minimum rather than having the most dkp and needing to hoard.
---
Why does the world record ragnaros kill (55 seconds) main tank duel wield axes with Bloodthirst? Must be all that reduced threat so that his 1000 dps melee don't pull aggro. You're lying about it creating less threat. Show me a deep prot warrior that can pull 550 single target dps while keeping aggro off of 1000 dps fury warriors while wearing 8 pieces of fire resistance gear.
---
It's going to be very weird to have 2 years of no balance changes.  I think that is the biggest deviation from actual vanilla, personally.
---
15g is the average price on my server so If you can sell it for 50 I'd go ahead and do it unless you wanna equip it.
---
Yes they are. Vanilla default raid frames you would drag the parties out from the raid screen and arrange them on your screen that way. There were no range indicators or class indicators on them. Xpearl was absolutely better than them.
---
So all new players desirve to be taken advantage of? Great design.
---
What naxx catchup gear is available in phase 1?
---
.rma
---
What server are you guys on? We’d take you in our guild 
---
You’re right it’s not their fault and they deserve to enjoy the game like the rest of us, plus the difficulty of the raids are such that he can get by just fine knowing the fight and you whispering him any deviations from what he is used to
---
I'm interested in trying out some different UI addons. My main goal is to have a better raid UI experience with something that is minimal blyet still informative. Not looking for character portraits. Currently using the default blizzard UI, any recommendations?
---
Yes... only a select few warriors will benefit from a root break on a 1 min cd in pvp.... very intelligent commentary
---
&gt;  When fighting mobs my same level i really feel i like i miss more than 30% of my white attacks and claw, ferocious bite, rake etc
---
Install damage meter addon, like Details! or Recount.  
---
And check how many misses you have. I had same worries, but after starting to track it I found that I have ~4% misses. 
---
And since there's inbuild 5% miss chance, that you can't remove - no +hit gear will help.  
---
Anyway, +hit will start to appear from 55+ gear )
---
Farming essences, air and water are 20g a piece on my server.
---
I now want to reroll to join you guys.
---
The problem there has nothing to do with the actual game, and everything to do with certain people wanting to be elitist for its' own sake.
---
Blizzard tried making all of the classes the same, in order to stop raid sociopaths from excluding people.  It didn't work.  Said raid sociopaths started writing addons like GearScore, and using that to justify exclusion instead.
---
There is a desire among certain people who play this game to maintain a Social Darwinist mindset, and they will actively look for and find excuses to do so, regardless of what changes are made to the actual mechanics.  The problem is social and psychological; it has nothing to do with the game itself.  The elitists try and claim that it is about the game, but they only do so because that provides them with justification, not because that is actually the case.
---
Frost is currently superior because it is viable in all PvE, PvP, and offers the best talents for gold farming.
---
I've had FD resist 8x in my last 3 runs. Twice on the boss fight and the rest during trash.
---
I’ve been in three different loot council and I can tell when they are funneling gear to certain people claiming performance. Performance doesn’t matter much in Mc and ony.  When some people get two loot and others with same class and spec get zero, the loot council is already corrupt.
---
2.0.1 was the tbc prepatch and it is nothing like 1.12 or 1.13.  It would have been an interesting to launch the game with the 2.0.1 patch though it would have been really weird.

I can't tell if that's just sarcasm because you don't want to respond properly or you genuinely missed my point.

Your original contention was that there is no convenient IRL equivalent to fishing in WoW to earn cash. The limit was 40 hrs/week. Is your point that the Skinner Box for virtual currency is a better use of time than the Skinner Box for IRL cash because you can earn more than 40hrs worth of virtual money?
---
Next one should be Freshpickle
---
Then you were physically too far away.
---
Not first, not even top ten.  And BTW Ony was killed by 5 people actually in vanilla before Naxx was released.

If people want to brag about self made challenges, at least make it an actual challenge.

Why didn't you take a screenshot of your pumpkin? Smh, all the people taking photos....
---
Multiboxing isnt a problem for blizzard, botting is. With multiboxing they just get more $$$, I guess thats why
---
Everything you say is true, but it's not useless. I use it all the time when I'm tank healing, seeing as I don't have the int and crit needed for an efficient moonglow spec.
---
I top the healing meters when I'm tank healing and we cleared all the content pretty easily. So it seems to be working just fine.
---
You seem to be forgetting that there are only 6 spellbinders (the only one that drop the recipe archmages DO NOT DROP IT) and they are on about a 10 minute respawn so you can only kill about 30-40 an hour so it's much less then 24g per hour.
---
Resilience exposed pve heroes. That's why it was the single greatest addition in WoW. In vanilla backpedalling noobs who lived in raids could one shot people in BGs, suddenly they couldn't anymore.
---
Which video is everyone referring to?!
---
Sorry but no. Botting is what needs to be reported. Blizzard are fine with multiboxers. :)
---
Just tell your friend to get discord and join, they don't need to know he can't hear anything. And if the leader says something important you can just send him messages. And your friend shouldn't be concerned about needing to talk either, I've had my mic muted every single raid I've been in, never needed to say a word.
---
It stacks on top of your weapon damage at a fat 15% Proc rate. I’m using it on my flurry axe on my level 60 protection paladin for aoe farming.
---
Since tanks are highly sought after for dungeons, but not necessarily raids (due to demand of dungeons vs raids), a dps warrior that happily tanks is highly valued. That’s why I said that. If you are wanting to be a MT for a guild, it’s tough to get into that slot. I won’t deny that. But “warrior tanks” isn’t limited specifically raid tanking nor players dead set on ONLY tanking.
---
As for dps warriors, they are top tier for raids, with being in a tier of their own by AQ and Naxx. If you look at logs, it’s entirely dominated by warriors and rogues right now, followed by mages. That is a far cry from “middle of the road”. Whatever warriors you are playing with are poorly geared or just fucking bad.
---
Can someone explain how this guy got so popular? He sits at like 9-20k viewers each stream, but as far as I'm aware he only started streaming when Classic dropped right?
---
Is he view botting?
---
Lol I should have looked at my tie when typing this
---
1) Look at your threat meter
---
2) Don't go above tank
---
3) if fail at 2) use Potion of Limited Invulnerability

Lvl 48 ret Paladin, leveling is Kind of Hard, Mobs Take forever to Kill, Not Many good Quest left. Some Tips to make my struggles less? Done with searing George, Tanaris etc, Currently trying my best in Blasted Lands, but there is just too much PvP.
---
I am a 60 rogue and didn't have an issue when I was leveling. a warrior should be all set.
---
Grind RFK until 33, then SM Lib til 37, then SM Arm from 37-42, SM Cath is 38-45.
---
38-45 you can mix Arm &amp; Cath.
---
On Faerlina, especially as horde it's **extremely easy**. On other servers LFG sucks.
---
No changes. People who want new stuff can always check out the latest retail expansion and/or try to convince Bliizard of BC/Wrath/whatever servers

---
Id have him join the discord, no need to tell anyone that he cant hear. If there's something unique or exact the raid lead wants done then communicate that to him individually by typing, if you are in the same room as him irl then sign. I feel like this could be done as with help
---
Ashbringer on EU was the good one I ended up on.  Horde aren't a walkover by any stretch, still very active around contested instances, but the Alliance are on the whole mostly positive about their chances and always willing to lend a hand.
---
There is this weird German ad for gum on YouTube right now. Basically a high school scene with the dude saying I don't know if I should kiss you, you are a zombie. And then she goes but I'm still hot, aren't I? Then they kiss and her hand falls off. It's weird
---
I say Strath because it sounds right when spoken, and Strat doesn’t. To me it’s not Strat-holme, it’s Strath-olme.
---
A lot of the time the group does shit due to a lack of basic dungeon techniques and understanding of their class, although overpulling and lost aggro can deplete a healers resources if the incoming damage comes towards less armored classes. It's often better to ensure tank has aggro rather than putting out more damage because it allows for better mana conservation which means less downtime between pulls.
---
It’s pretty much up to you until you reach 32. I went to STV and tamed a lvl 32 strangle thorn tiger and it came with dash and possibly a higher ranking bite. The panthers in the area will usually have prowl as well. Not as needed as dash but still got for you to learn while you’re there.
---
At this point you can make the call what pet you will run with. PvP the boar is good with charge, a bear or turtle would be good for tanking and solo leveling, overall the tiger you get in STV is good for high dps. As a hunter you will want to take and abandon other pets to learn their abilities to chain your main pet. Should be more info on YouTube or petopedia.

I get stuck behind the fucking toolboxes on the ground in BRD constantly. It’s like the titanium trees in GTA

because it keeps the game consistent.  Resilience was never anything but a crutch.  And if you do bg's, you also get gear.
---
I brought this up in another thread, and got downvoted to hell for being "sexist" lol
---
I think there was a balance issue- Horde had Trolls, Orcs, Tauren, Undead, and Goblins, while Alliance had Humans, Elfs, and Dwarfs.
---
I'm the SM/ruin guy in our raid so i get no threat reduction thingies but i usually just throw a corruption and wait 10 seconds before i start to shadowbolt spam. Might not be ideal if you're in a guild that looks at parses.
---
Off topic : Do people look at parses the same as they do in retail? What's the difference between a high DPS warlock and a low DPS warlock nowadays besides flasks and pots across the whole raid and resists and crits?
---
I'm not really sure about playing druid for this sorry.  There is another reply to this comment of someone saying they were successful at killing her quickly, I'd try asking them.

get Titan Panel Classic and Titan Panel Recommend Zones.  Titan Panel will put a bar at the top that will show you things like your exact location, time to level, money, bag space, what condition your armor is in, etc.  Super useful to have in one bar

There's a mount that costs 5 million.
---
I am in the same boat.. I have pieced together a healing set and I’m raiding. I’ve always been upfront about yes I’ll tank for the group but I need healing gear for raids and I’d say at least 60% of the time it hasn’t been an issue. Be prepared for getting kicked out or being told no thanks we will find someone else when you ask though because it’s bound to happen. I might have just had bad luck with groups but it’s been an issue a good amount of times. 
---
I always look for group as heals now so it makes it easier but if I get a whisper to tank then I always say I will but I will be rolling on healer gear and it’s up to the group at that point

MC is easy but casual guilds probably won't kill cthun or 4 horsemen. Some people want a hardcore guild that will clear all raids and also dominate open world content like devilsaur, gurubashi arena, world bosses etc.

Not saying Tips guild is going to do any of that though.

Whats the addon for the health and mana bars?

It is not sarcasm.

WoW with changes is current, retail WoW.  Classic, first and foremost, should be a time capsule preservation piece, and there should be servers *always* dedicated to that purpose.  Whether the game changes or not doesn't make it any less of a living, breathing world.
---
Classic+ is an intriguing idea, but I still don't understand why people can't grasp that it would be *super* easy to spin these up on their own servers.  Sure, let's give Classic+ a try!!!  But duplicate everyone's character, and give me the choice between logging in to Herod or "Herod+"

As you get + healing power it becomes more efficient to downrank because you get the same + healing on any rank of spell. However the amount of + healing that actually goes on your spells scales down the faster the spell is. A 3.5 second cast might get 100% of your + healing, but an instant cast gets something like 10-20%, and renew is an instant cast.
---
Rogue set is prebis :)
---
The drunk ones just chill in taverns. I aspire to be one of them.
---
True but I don't think that's something you take in leveling specs.
---
Paladins
---
But Sulfuras also has insane damage compared to other weapons available now, its proc also does good damage and ignores armor and mace spec doesn't DR other stuns.
---
Yes and I believe it was proven to not work
---
To be fair if someone saw me tag a mob before him. We had never spoken and he accuses me of botting I'd probably write him off as an idiot too.
---
as far as im aware on pvp servers youre not even allowed to communicate and coordinate with the other faction, and circumventing with multi accounts is still not allowed.
---
You literally said “they are middle of the road”. So while you didn’t say they were bad, you are definitely misrepresenting their power.
---
Yes, you’re still a tank. You don’t have to be a guild MT to be a tank. Some people can happily just be a dungeon tank-for-here on a toon, never tanking a raid. They are still tanks.
---
Guild bank is the only change I would really want.
---
I have a healthy suspicion that most folks actually want TBC, not vanilla.
---
The issue is that many of these guilds are the same guilds you will blow off because they aren’t good enough.
---
My guild constantly tells jokes and goofs off during raids, but we’ve been blown off by multiple people because we haven’t cleared MC yet. This is our second week raiding as a guild, but hot damn we don’t have MC cleared because we are a bunch of noobs that don’t take raiding seriously.
---
It isn't easy? Just say you're deaf and instead of listening to the raid leader explain the fight, just read up on it beforehand? (Which is usually a requirement anyways)...
---
You'd wear rogue dungeon set 0 over devilsaur?  Honestly not heard anyone say that, and I'm a bit skeptical.  From my understanding, even the scholo set is far better.  I'm not a rogue though.  Just to be clear, I'm not talking about T1 from MC, because the only thing that makes sense is you think I'm talking about that.
---
Sí.
---
You can support the comics by buying out my auctions :P
---
What unit frames are you using? To show the class color and the dragon?
---
The biggest thing is to ignore DPS elitists who tell you that you should only ever use a 2h even for tanking, and to use the best shield you can find.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=1979
---
If you can get the money for it on your server, then I would recommend that.
---
Well you aren't very aware because that hasn't been the case in over 10 years.
---
P.s. I'm alliance. Reported for communicating with me.
---
I love the Barrens. I've leveled 3 toons just to be able to play it longer. I've been playing since the early days of Vanilla and am so glad to be home again.
---
So was Beethoven
---
You need 39 in arms to get MS, you def take specialization. Axe is best but as a human warrior I like swords and maces, only shame is the mace specialization is terrilbe
---
All I heard when I read this was the oblivion guard yelling why wont you die lol
---
If there are 4 or 5 tanks and I'm assigned to a tank then I think it makes sense to renew, but if there are only 1 or 2 and/or I'm assigned to group healing, the point is that renew gets very little out of your + healing, so is generally a mana inefficient spell to cast.
---
Sulfuras is the best hunter weapon, followed closely by ironfoe. Funnel both to your hunters for maximum efficiency
---
Imagine if the OP played a rogue?  He'd put all the hunters druids and warriors on his ignore list and never find a group for anything
---
Melted
---
The PPM is a simplified explanation of a percentage chance.  Like if you were to say....in paper rock scissors if choices are made randomly you should win 1 out of every 3 games.
---
But in reality you may win 5 in a row.  Or lose 5 in a row.  But over an extended period of time you'll win about 1 of every 3.
---
The PPM on seal of command is about 7 times in a minute regardless of what weapon you use.  By using a slow weapon it effectively means that you'll have a higher chance per swing of it proccing.  This means that you are better off using the slowest and hardest hitting weapon you can to maximize chance and damage overtime.
---
There is no hidden timer.  It doesnt matter if you recast it every second or let it run out every time.
---
I think it was introduced in WotLK if I remember correctly.
---
If this is how you want to play, hey, more power to ya, but this isn't the reality of a lot of us...
---
Shaman, Hunter, Warrior, Druid, no cleave groups. 
---
I've only finished MC in guild raids. 
---
Yesterday I was helping a guildy and now that I think about it, there was a full pop of fire elementals. 
---
Well I just checked Qia for fun, and she was alone. No bots in sight. 
---
Maybe you should switch servers.
---
yes im going by vanilla rules
---
Implying item level really meant anything in Vanilla. There's some huge upgrades in AQ40 and some of the best gear in the game is on the lower end of the item level spectrum. It's all about stat allocation.
---
Also, I doubt he was trying to say they can't kill any Naxx bosses because of their lack of AQ gear, but more so their lack of AQ gear probably means they couldn't kill many/any AQ40 bosses and therefor likely won't be killing much in Naxx.
---
But sure, he's the clueless one.
---
Might've been in wotlk prepatch, but it's a wotlk feature
---
A man who lives up to their username. Great job, keep it up!
---
&gt; it has the best healing power scaling of all your spells.
---
This is contrary to what I've heard though. It's an instant cast, doesn't that mean it gets less of your + healing power?
---
Not enough neon green
---
always found it funny that such a ancient, timeless, elemental lord such as himself would use a line of this much vulgarity.
---
I play Tauren and I do that and /sigh every time I afk in an inn. It looks so comfortable tbh.
---
Just stop dying (but actually, you can turn the memes off in DBM settings)
---
Because that's what it launched with.
---
You can make 1000g spending an hour a day playing if you play smart. It's really not a lot of money. Epic mounts cost 1000g yet people manage to get them without issue.
---
I am using it but even with all addons disabled and my WTF folder deleted it was happening. This weekend I'll try re installing the game and not using YAHT at all though, thanks.
---
You have to reroll. I made this mistake too, got to level 40 and spent 2 hours LFG during prime time.
---
Go to Faerlina. 30m Queues are nothing compared to 2hour LFG.
---
Sure, why not...
---
Top poster used the phrase "Reminds me of my first time in STV back in true vanilla." I was just pointing out that "true" is kind of pointless as you could just say "back in vanilla". I was being cheeky with "as opposed to false vanilla?".
---
Simple enough for you?
---
So is there a date when all realms should not have it?
---
This thinking gave us retail
---
Ayy
---
You made a whole post bitching about a blue piece that you could go get again cause you didn’t bother to check your bags or loot the corpse to make sure you had it?
---
Yeah Pre-patch introduced it for Wrath
---
Outstanding
---
It's called sniping and it's a real nonbotting thing.
---
That’s how it should be. If you are incredibly outgeared you should lose unless you are an incredibly skilled player. 
---
Don’t be mad that someone else worked harder for gear, you just want to act like you are more skilled than a pve player at pvp, when in reality a pve player was better than you cuz he had better gear and that makes you mad.
---
Swing and a miss
---
Yes they are in classic. They are called patch of Elemental water. They are only in azshara and you need a minimum fishing of 330 to be able to fish them, but you need 420 to consistently catch anything out of them.
---
How do you delete somebody else's post?
---
Show a blue post where it's stated that they're fine with a tool what allows to automatically control several characters at a time, or you're a liar.
---
I recommend questing on green quests as a druid.  When running dungeons, dps behind the target.  It won’t stop misses, but you won’t be parried so you’ll land more hits anyways.
---
Weapon skill is meaningless in shapeshifted forms.  The skill that matters is feral combat, which automatically levels when you do.  Keep in mind also that you can’t proc anything chance on hit.  Weapon damage is also meaningless.  You’re mainly looking for stat sticks to put in your weapon slots.
---
The other melee classes also have issues with accuracy.  It can be mitigated for those classes by playing either orc or human and using an axe or sword respectively.  You’ll start seeing accuracy gear in the 50s with Blackstone ring and that trinket from Hinterlands.  Unfortunately you’ll have to outroll all the other melee classes when it comes to dungeon drops.
---
Devilsaur+shadowcraft 6pc. I have t1 bp and took it off and replaced with shadowcraft when I got all 6 pieces.
---
I certainly won't be. One character with both of those skills is enough.
---
You must be confusing it with something else.  It does not interrupt.
---
but it sucks to play a game where you're at a large disadvantage competitively because you lost the roll on bre
---
for people who enjoy fair competition, tbc pvp gear was great
---
All it need to be is like 
---
“So XXXg for Y item?”
---
And then they say yes.
---
I can probly solo as spriest with hydra's path bug method, but its actually harder as two - grp combo has low dps and no interrupts aswell - he heals more from the sacrifice than we do in dps
---
thanks.
---
One more - I have increased chance to crit on overpower, does that apply to a SS hit as well?
---
elvui
---
If you're talking about the Ogre/hyena/hyena pat then yes they do pat to the boss but they have a long pat so theoretically you shouldn't run into them... If you do, however, just keep the boss in a spot out of their path until they walk by. 
---
If its the pat if 3 hyenas you're referring, yes they can aggro during boss kill but it's pretty easy to keep boss away from them if you mark them like I do. If they aggro it can be very tricky to juggle the boss with them since they have different run speeds. I personally reset but it's possible to juggle them with him.
---
Cool thanks.  Just hit 225 and have the +25 rod, will have to level up and buy some lures for 420.  =)
---
But they weren't in the group, technically
---
This is why Faerlina is the best server. If you're not on Faerlina, trust me you're missing out.
---
I hate AssMeth but the shere numbers of Faerlina is unmatched.
---
Clown.
---
This is how to Classic properly.
---
They want high cost in an attempt to make it "rewarding" to obtain. Sort of an accomplishment if you will.
---
As a Father/family man/working adult myself though, I agree with you.
---
Maybe make it a reward for some sort of epic quest chain that has you travel throughout both continents or something. Not something dependent on the economy or that a streamer can beg fans to help him accomplish.
---
Try reading the post before commenting...
---
Cats are the best pets.
---
I've seen plenty of scary stuff in my time but the other night a BRD pug asked if I could mark targets and lead.
---
Does "If you play smart" contain playing a mage, having alrdy a huge gold base or a specific profession?
---
If yes, your answer is nonsense.
---
Also, it didn't launched with 1k gold cost to unlock, at least not in comparison to classic.
---
Common courtesy is just to make sure your actual healer doesn't need the piece first, and just let the group know beforehand. If anyone has an issue with that then it's probably not a group you want to run with anyway.
---
Nope, that is what I did. Sell all the skins to make money for the mount. Then once you are high enough levels skin the devilsaurs to get mats for the set.
---
Cheers :)
---
99% sure at this point you just outright haven’t leveled a Hunter or haven’t leveled a Hunter with Cat being used properly. Glhf :/
---
The most readable font I've found is [Montserrat](https://www.1001freefonts.com/d/5711/montserrat.zip), example [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/521840458889166854/636378943150358557/unknown.png).
---
&gt; Right now the only good money-making methods are selling in-demand services to other players or by selling tons of vendor trash like greys, cloth, green weapons, and boss drops.
---
Or just make major mana potions and mongoose elixirs and sell them for 10-15g per stack.
---
Ew no way. Paladin t2 is easily the best looking.
---
Cata was the sweet spot for me. Cause I could racechange to dwarf and cast whilr walking. And fire was THE spec
---
Allied races.
---
None of the bullshit. Just as additional skins for their main races after the relevant expansion they were introduced.
---
Huh? I literally don't care how you or anyone are playing a video game. It doesn't matter, at all. And yet you're in here in a thread about how min/maxers are bad, horrible people, stating that \*we're\* hateful.
---
And r/classicwow is constantly bitching and moaning about the crime of being excited about a nerdy hobby and daring to talk about it online. Wanting to talk to each other about interesting stuff! How horrible that must be for you.
---
Huh. I didn't know multiboxer users ran **Blizzard Support**.
---
Does this mean there's something lacking from Classic?
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Question: What version talent tree is in Classic?
---
_-------edit-------------
---
Correct. And it ***meant something*** when we wiped and had to run back to the entrance. It made doing Gnomer a truly great night. This was when it meant something to *complete* a dungeon. I can't remember when THAT was last true.
---
How?

---
I want the 2.0.1 Talent tree so more classes and specs are viable.
---
My player cast bar (which is part of the base UI) is displaying other hunter's casts. I'm not talking about an enemy cast bar.
---
If any hunter within vision range of me uses a non-channeled cast (multishot, aimed shot) it shows it in my cast bar. If I am currently casting a multishot or an aimed shot and another hunter in my vision range casts one of these spells it displays their cast in my player castbar instead.
---
I can play the game with an entirely default UI and I still have this issue.
---
This is the genre of video that got me into playing Guild Wars 2 obsessively in the end-game.  So many people there have this same style of raid guilds who also make videos.
---
i /clap to your overall view and intelligence, i am glad i didnt have to explain it myself to clueless #!@#@, there is still hope in this world
---
Try kurzens compounds or the venture co miner south of that in stv
---
These videos are amazing! Keep it up!
---
Oooh ooohhh they got moves like Jagger
---
I know frost is the recommend mage leveling spec but what are thoughts about putting those first points into arcane and picking up wand specialization? Like with priest leveling
---
kill mobs and do quests wtf
---
This. There’s plenty of people in my guild who never talk in Discord. I would have no way of knowing if they’re deaf nor would I care.
---
Well they can fuck off with that.
---
If they want a more true Vanilla experience then they can complete some epic quest chain.
---
Classic WoW has only been somewhat like Vanilla, because people have all the knowledge required to make shit loads of gold and what not (among other things as well). We had to figure all that shit out back in 04/05/06 so it didn't happen as fast or as extreme as it is now.
---
Well I would say there is 0 content after 60+BiS... You could go gank *evil smile*, you could put time and effort into helping guildies, you could travel the world attempting to champion lowbies that are getting ganked, rep grind, etc...
---
At the end of the day you could just play another game until phase 2 drops as well.
---
BTW I enjoy gold farming. The only justification I need is that I enjoy it just because. It feels good to be WoW rich lol. It's called living vicariously hahaha.
---
Do not do this, trade channel is for trade.
---
Id be ok with double elves. The reason the Forsaken are called the Forsaken is because they are Forsaken by the Alliance, who say them as an unnatural threat that couldnt be trusted, so that couldnt work imo. Joining the Horde wasnt  majorly plausible either, but the Horde gave them protection and a strategic presence in the EK.
---
LvL 59
---
Wearing tri-force-whatnot neck from SM.
---
Hangs head in shame.
---
Never farm what you need.
---
Farm gold, and buy what you need. 
---
It is \*almost\* ALWAYS more efficient. Only time it would be inefficient is a low % high value item that you somehow get amazingly lucky on.
---
[Actually it did launch with a 1k gold cost.] (https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Dual_Talent_Specialization) However I believe it was introduced in wrath so 1k gold at max level wasn't asking for much. Perhaps 500g for classic would be more reasonable
---
OK, but you said "nobody gave a shit back then" but any guild that actually downed C'thun and progressed in Naxx absolutely did care. I agree that mentality isn't necessary at this stage of the game and people are certainly being loot whores and taking things more seriously than they should in MC,
---
Shamans and druids are needed for raids and you’ll get geared instantly but you have to heal which kinda sucks :/
---
Okay so ds lock 1 curse of shadow, ds lock 2 curse of elements, ds lock 3 curse of reckless and sm lock corruption and siphon life.   
---
Seems like sort of a waste to not have sm lock using agony when specced for it but guess other classes have debuffs more worth keeping up then.   
---
Bet the shamans were pissed, it's a really meh weapon for warrior.
---
Hunters, warlocks, priests, mages and druids can all solo farm lots of gold in DM. Warriors, rogues, paladins and shamans can two man farm lots of gold in DM. No class is screwed over, you're just bad and grumpy.
---
This guy was just running around killing players at all levels. It requires 0 skill and makes for a shitty playing experience for the people trying to actually enjoy the game. People that do this just have a hard on for feeling powerful and they're trash 1v1 so they multi-box to compensate. Literally the embodiment of the wow player in South Park.
---
No wonder he's a little salty.
---
Macros ez
---
yeah but you cant have warlocks takeing up 65% of the debuff slots on things that really dont make a dent on the bigger scale.
---
Shakedown 1979, cool kids never have the time
---
No, nobody needs war chiefs blessings it’s just extra all guilds only need ony head and dm buffs
---
2.60? I have 1handers slower than that
---
Early AM runs if possible. I do my questing then and pass plenty of those potential land mines.
---
Yeah one of the main reasons I haven’t cared for raiding mc is because there is too many mages. I’m just farming bis for everything else outside of mc
---
What did it cost you?
---
I mean lets be honest if you have a spit macro you’re probably a pretty salty player.
---
Looks so sick on a Tauren! The glowy eyes
---
You forgot to mention something.....  EU or US?
---
"two man farm".
---
Everyone can farm gold with someone else. What bullshit answer is that?
---
a}  Why are you spelling profanity like that?  You're not going to get censored for it here.
---
b}  This game dates from a time before Communist Millennials expected centralised authorities to get rid of anything they didn't like.  Some of us really wish we could go back to that time, and we also really want to hold on to whatever artifacts of it still exist.
---
Back in 2007, as a Horde player, I used to see Alliance players doing this.  We didn't report it to Blizzard and ask them to stop it; we assembled a group in-game and fought off the Alliance ourselves.
---
Blasphemy!
---
Yup, while anecdotal, I do see a lot of players asking if arenas were going to be added to classic. Some of them I'm sure have no clue when they were added. 
---
On the other hand I want TBC because its raid content is one of a kind imo. In wrath we do get ulduar, but hard modes are the first step towards toggle modes ala ToGC and ICC
---
thanks I hate it
---
If your friend is genuinely deaf and needs a guild I'm super shocked people have treated them this way, its unacceptable really. I would post on your servers subreddit about your friends situation, or rather they should make the post themselves and I would be super skeptical that everyone on the server acts like this.
---
Thing is mages really dont wanna take dmg. Unlike priests they really dont have any mana effective shields at that point or any healing. This means both fight duration and downtime will be longer than what it has to be. Instead they wanna front load their dmg with frostbolts, novas and fireblasts and start wanding at the very end to let the mp5 kick in. You always wanna utilize your class' biggest strengths, and sadly wand spec isn't one of them in this case.
---
Felwood is legit, forgot about that place
---
Ohhhh that’s lit haha thanks for clarifying that good looks.
---
TIL why I like comic sans LoL
---
Correct, I did hardcore raiding from vanilla up through Trial of the grand crusader(never tried for r14 though in vanilla). What am I doing now? I joined like the first guild that invited me and we have like 4 level 60's in the guild. I don't.. actually give much of a crap.
---
Honestly the same argument applies for pvp tho.
---
Don’t be mad that someone worked harder for pvp gear.
---
Working harder, you mean spamming three macros?
---
Gold is much easier to come by nowadays in retail.
---
Can I just say, I enjoyed this exchange/thread (in the "lemme grab my popcorn" kind of way), it's really kinda hilarious.
---
This had literally everything:
---
&gt; Like are you 14?
---
&gt; What are you.. 60 years old?
---
&gt; Sarah McChlachlan commercial of an emotionally charged excuse for an argument
---
&gt; HURRR DURRRR
---
&gt; Quit being a fuckin child.
---
&gt; compared to a fucking Nintendo DS you Mongol
---
&gt; You really are a special kind of moron, aren't you?
---
And especially 
---
&gt; fucking crickets with 1 or 2 passive aggressive downvotes
---
&gt; Sounds like youre the salty boys man. Am i mad or are you pathetic, thats the real question.
---
Lol.
---
Blammo. Faction ratio seems extremely balanced.
---
I agree, but I think we're talking about different things. Not going oom is playing optimal in the same way doing nothing while full mana is playing less optimal.
---
Disclaimer: Again, talking about random groups and "little stuff", nothing even worth a polite tell.
---
whoever is downvoting you is a dickbag
---
Go to southern tanaris and grind beasts around the big skeletons
---
Thats pugna
---
Yup I was thinking this same thing. I know the thread is basically dead, but so often I see a ton of rogues wearing at least 4% hit cause it's what BIS says. I've thought what you said is true, yet it seems like 90% of people are seemingly still convinced they need at least 4% from gear
---
Not on 1v1, but on group PvP is by far the best, and the one that scales the most
---
Best content since launch
---
AAAAYYyyyy more people from Alleria raiding scene! Have you found anyone else? Everyone I found did not roll on the same servers really. I found light, dade, failure, melkita, and a few others through vanilla friends and such but I couldn't find anyone that wanted to really group up. A few joined apparently some pserver groups and rolled a guild with them but the original members aren't there. I remember dragging my 2nd warrior to a group with you guys once or twice doing some alt shit but didn't play with a lot of you guys.
---
How do I be in your guild?
---
What does a raid healing Shadow spec look like? It seems like an interesting spec.
---
5/5 Shadow Weaving and rest Holy?
---
I only really dislike a few things about TBC: the neutral city bugged me a lot, the rogue stun meta was awful, and the insane faction imbalance blood elves caused ruined the game.
---
SMOrc
---
&gt; It's just your worthless opinion too.
---
This is an example of why I learned to hate the Left.  You claim to be advocating the wellbeing of everyone, but you will condemn anybody as worthless, the very second that they disagree with you.
---
Garrison's ruined the economy when people could make 10(whatever the max limit was in WoD) characters to max level (most people already did since cata) and then log on for gold missions every time they were up.. certain garrison followers or ships or whatever gave bonuses to how much gold you got and I think people were able to rake in like 10k a month or something like that.
---
Ask people in general for help.
---
I wouldnt use Corruption as DS unless you've been allowed to. Leave it to the SM ruins.
---
Anwyays I flask/max consume in raids while also being the tank group warlock on horde side, so no threat reduction for me. My tip is investing in limited invulernabiliy potions &amp; put your threat meter someplace ot's easy to see. I have it right above my target frame. Besides that? Get a feel for the fights, swap mobs if you're high on threat on something. Take notes on encounters &amp; tanks. Some fights tanks do more threat &amp; understand when you can start DPSing.
---
first mobs I found with a decent drop rate of mageweave were the mobs in ZF, outside of a dungeon would be the mobs you farm for timbermaw rep.
---
Of course Dark Edge is better. I was talking more about the situation today. Even compared to BRE, you would need at least 2 procs for it to out damage Sulfuras. That might be realistic in a premade, but otherwise Sulfuras does more damage in addition to having a stun.
---
&lt;cries in Warrior&gt;
---
This is what happens.  People tell all these mindless horde derps to reroll on their well balanced realm after they’ve destroyed their own realms with imbalance.
---
I knew I wasn't the only one experiencing low Rumsey drop rates 😭
---
Pretty sure I was the priest in your ZF run hahah I was thinking very coincidental an undead warrior posted it a few hours after our run
---
Found the rogue

I waited until I had a mount first so I can zip around areas more quickly. I'm 60 now, picked up herbalism 3 days ago. Me personally, it took ~2 hours per day over those 3 days to level from 0-300.  I also used an addon called Gatherer?... that left a mark on my map for each flower node I tried to collect which def helped.
---
I’m with you on this. Personally, I wouldn’t roll on someone’s class set piece if they needed it.
---
Holy shit, now this is the real wall of text.
---
If you think 2-3 hours a day is very casual you should drop the game and not look back. It definitely sounds like you'll be making time in your life to play soon rather than sitting down with nothing left to do. You don't want to blink your eyes and have a few years pass especially with a small kid. If you're getting bored at home pick up an instrument or starting designing a garden/sandpit/cubby house you can build with your kid when you recover, it'll be much more rewarding than building a wow character. Definitely not worth playing in your situation.
---
Aww :/
---
Is that trinket really with all the gold your going to spend?
---
Jesus.... move out dude. That honestly sounds like a very toxic environment you're trying to escape and your boyfriend kinda drags you back onto the game. I can totally imagine the part were you come home and you kinda mention how you feel sad for them at this is not good to live by every single day only to get laughed at. Your parents need a strong reality check man, and I rekon you moving out of there might make them wake up and realize HANG on. Were being shitty parents here by ignoring our daughter.
---
That's the thing most of them came out of nowhere, and don't know how to handle their sudden fame.
---
Ok thanks yea thats a good idea.  I guess it's just taking too long to find and collect the herbs before I can move onto the next zone where I need a higher level to get those herbs.
---
I think I'll switch back to skinning for now, since it's pretty plentiful and I can do it during a lot of quests.
---
*after being insulting*
---
I'm in a tryhard guild and we aren't toxic at all. It's quite an enjoyable experience, really.
---
Inserts dwarf beard into water
---
I agree moving out would help.
---
&gt;The idea that you can’t clear MC without being able to hear the nerd rage on discord is idiotic.
---
I mean, if I was running an MC pug and we had a frustrating wipe and a certain player didn't do their job, if I find out that they had discord muted then it's an easy decision to kick them. They just wasted like 20+ minutes of everyone's time.
---
If someone told me they were legit deaf then I'd make an exception. I'd be willing to type out raid warnings for fights and stuff, and I'd know not to call on them in a snap situation. 
---
If you're so socially anxious that you fear nerd rage from discord, you should look for a guild lol. There's a guild on the front page posting a video of them having fun in raid. Fun fact: that's *most* guilds. *Most* guilds treat the game like a game.
---
Yeah seems to happen a lot to me.  One hit will kill it and it takes like 3-4 swings.
---
No changes... So what vid card are you using? What's your internet speed? Better be using dial up!
---
If one was so inclined where would one download the required files to make this work?
---
When you hit 60 you should have a couple hundred gold without even trying. It's not much more effort to turn that into 1000g on the AH.
---
Then what was patch 1.13? Or am I misremembering and there was no 1.13?
---
Unless dungeon solo grinding, best spots are highly contested.
---
I consider 190 ms to be pretty normal even today :(
---
Love the weird Goblin dance they do.
---
same model as warmonger, but with fel swirley
---
I had the off hand that lowers spell resist off that boss. Man, 6 hours of progression raiding just to clear Maexxena and spider wing...

Someone could earn $200,000 and yet be unable to afford a $15 subscription because they more pressing financial obligations - car payments, credit card debt, childcare, etc. Or they could earn $50k and be putting all their money into savings so they can retire early. Or they could have $14 million and scrimp and save as if they were utterly impoverished. Or earn a McDonald's wage and prioritize bills and savings over a WoW subscription fee, because that is the smart and fiscally responsible thing to do.
---
There are all kinds of good reasons why intelligent adults don't spend cash on gaming. Alas, you're too stupid to understand any of them.
---
Are all the people gatekeeping which classes/specs are allowed to make easy money playing stuff like mages or tanks?
---
Played a ret paly for 15 years and the only class that dunks on me is shadow priests lol.
---
This is where I’m at too. Not sure it’s worth holding for bloodvine - but if you’re not gonna make an alt for Alch then maybe it’s worth dropping for something that can make some gold.
---
I’m very torn to be honest
---
Not outside of the game. However, you can get into the habit of logging into your bank alt a few times per play sesssion to scan the AH.
---
Our guild only has 3 mages, but has like 10 warriors. So our mages are all decked out and pieces are going to an officer to DE later on, while the warriors don't get any loot because the 4 things in MC that are any good won't drop.
---
You spec normal shadow and just heal the raid? It’s not like you lose your healing spells unless you spec holy.
---
Ok, ya the full pally t2 is awesome. I tend to forget as I usually play horde lol
---
This leaked guild meeting from tips aged well https://youtu.be/bz6P0S-J45M
---
See, this meme doesn't work when what you're saying is actually true.
---
Three people still have to navigate to the meetingstone, and the stones only get you on the outside you still have to navigate to the pre-maze to find the instance inside. It also makes for a great PVP experience.
---
I got mine really quickly by just advertising in the zone chat that I pay 5 gold per pool of blood. If you promise a reward, people will look out for them and message you constantly. The amount of time you save by doing this is definitely worth the gold investment.
---
What am I missing on the importance of being a tailor and demonic rune
---
You didn’t play a rogue on smolderweb did you?
---
So I beat him down with my glowing brightwood staff, total noob
---
People are having fun?
---
They are constantly farmed. They have a respawn of about 3 hours and there are only 6 pools. I wouldn’t bother unless u can get on at 4 am and even then u might only get a couple of pools.
---
Flasks?
---
Just so you’re aware mate, you are only able to repeatedly hand in Runecloth for rep.
---
Ohhh ok
---
This one is gay
---
Dang, that's rough. I feel bad getting the neck my first run. I was about to rage quit too, tank couldn't hold aggro even with 10 seconds of no dps.
---
only 2 wipes out of like 8 runs of it, not that bad.
---
They dont, its kinda ridiculous.
---
I don't know if anyone already said, but you can't even use a pet.
---
Faerlina will never be dead, and a balanced faction ratio.
---
Save money by rolling here and not server transfer later
---
Grob is RP PvP and insanely balanced, and might be the only PvP server with an alliance advantage. Huge wpvp, at least 3 Ally guilds dedicated to it, and a handful of horde guilds dedicated to PvP as well (my guild does wpvp on Friday nights).
---
Your main spec is the spec you are currently geard as; other wise why make the distinction between main spec/off spec? 
---
He **trying** to become a mainspec healer.
---
But in the dungeon, if he’s tanking it then his ms is tanking, if he wants prio on heal gear he should heal
---
Fairbanks is pretty balanced, it does favor horde but who doesn't?
---
Mageweave primarily drops off level 40-47 humanoids.
---
Level 37 humanoids drop silk
---
I am actually on at 4am often.  So we will see.
---
If your main attack crits, sweeping strikes will then also crit the second target although the damage number doesn’t pop up big like a crit does
---
There’s a quest given by an orphan in SW to talk to the innkeepers in each capital city, and the reward is a stack of treats that put a random costume on you and this is one of them
---
"Everything reserved"
---
Cool, thanks
---
I would rather have a reduced respec cost, but I never played during the dual spec days so maybe it's too good to pass up.
---
Blegh I really don't want to take the time to level an alt to 35 :-/

^ ^  Shits’ classic.
---
I remember vaguely someone telling us... “you don’t want classic.”
---
this is my super secret move in ratchet. it's best used near guards.
---
you can't be blocked or parried when you attack the mob from behind
---
Yeah I know
---
BuT ThErE wErE nO aDdOnS iN cLaSsIc!

---
They do. Open a ticket and provide screenshots,

Server and name of the individual. They will get to them.
---
Your friend’s a dirtbag.
---
No. If that is the case what is the difference between saying “Main spec” “Off spec”
---
I've seen several Shamans using only Chain Heal, even when they're healing one person. Is that how you play the class or are these people just bad?
---
Correct, I used hyperbole and you took it literally
---
Well.. the warlock has the right specc in this screen.  
---
But when I see some of these rogues, I doubt they are all fully equipped for Naxx, thus the warlock propably doesnt have tons of crit (T2 helmet doesnt give crit afaik.)
---
Were you a high school kid who clicked your spells? We still cared about BiS back then lol
---
Different strokes for different folks. I like classic the way it is. I've liked classic since 06 when I played as a child. I may be playing the game differently now than I did then, but I'm still having fun.
---
Not everyone will share your same opinion. Classic is the experience I want.
---
What is the addon called that has your CD abilities mid-screen? I’ve wanted to use this on my warrior.
---
He already said his friend will be in discord and type what he needs to know to him, and that he knows the encounters.
---
I could see flasking the main tank, but no way do you need flasks on everyone
---
Probably 1 out of the 100 you see are an actual female. I might be too generous with those odds, too.
---
Erm.... i know there USED to be........
---
Try Bind-Pad
---
edit 2: [This might also work](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/profiles-keyboard-binds) for classic since its a legacy addon
---
Seems someone got teabhag'therad.
---
A+ Content. Great video. Giggled many times!
---
yeah I think you fucked up
---
get a CRT monitor and an old computer
---
You're the dumbest person in this thread - i'm just using hyperbole
---
Just lazy, obviously other heals give more value on single target
---
Our guild on fairbanks is like this :) Except we cant kill rag because we bad
---
You're my favorite guild.
---
I have noticed if you try to vanish too quickly it doesn’t register. I assume it’s a client to server thing so unfortunately you have to let them aggro you for 2-3 seconds. 
---
Ive had several problems like you’ve described so this is how I handle it.
---
Did you use a guide for leveling up? Why or why not? If yes, which one did you use?
---
35 wipes means 35 times I've killed the boss haha. Not sure why it says that
---
sometimes you're lucky, sometimes you don't. on the other hand I got Hands of Power from zigris on my first run, but ended up running LBRS ~15 times anyway to get the pants.
---
Alright, error on my side. Although its not 70%. It's 100/110*0.8=72.7% for melees and 100/130=76.9% for ranged.
---
It's theoretical TPS you're talking about. You simply can't spam sunder armor, you never have enough rage for that. That's also a point why people go FuryProt. WAY more rage. Then the boss parries a few times and you're fucked. As i said, you miss around 30% of all hits against bosses, unless you stack +hit. Warlocks consistently do 3k shadowbolts. Try that tanking away with a mere 375tps, unless you want to build up threat for a solid 2minutes.
---
&gt; Both Ferals and Balance both offer a 3% crit that, with the correct group composition, make them far more valuable than the added dps of a mage
---
3% crit on 4 party members typically adds up to 12% extra damage. Based on the damage I've seen ferals and oomkins do, that's not even close to enough for them to make up for their lack of damage.
---
Paladins are one of the most useful classes to have in a party so try grinding instances like ZF or if your level permits Mara
---
800x600 resolution with no aa and the graphics slider at 2 or 3.
---
DW leveling is extremely painful. I would level with a 2h.
---
This worked on some pservers. There is a video of a low level paladin causing havoc doing this. I think named Verycoolguy but I might have the name wrong.
---
Slavedriver’s Cane or get out.
---
I leveled to 60 through quests as a fury 2h warrior, except I did stockades once lol I think you should be in ungoro, felwood, west plaguelands, east plague lands, burning steppes, and winter spring for the rest of your levels. If you like dungeons that’s an option too, I started dungeon grinding at 60 and I’m nearly all  pre raid bis now and all the dungeons are a breeze because I’m 60.
---
I know that this pumpkin will be so underappreciated by anyone who sees it, but I think its brilliant.
---
noooo. 
---
But honestly they could correct the unforgivable error of not launching rated battlegrounds sometime during BC instead of WAYYY too late in Cataclysm.
---
Hope they signed a prenup
---
Said no one ever.
---
I remember just to kill Gluth we went out and got completely world buffed and came into Naxx to.have ONE shot to kill him. If we didnt kill him we went onto another boss lol. People are dumb.
---
Yeah, and even then you can pay for that with mats collecting during the raid.
---
Guild bank and key ring. I know you said one but I want both equally.
---
Got my +healing cape 2 days before diremaul came out. Already crafted my hide and replaced it. Feels bad.
---
That’s a very cute story. I wish I could be that age again. Even when i was 12/13 playing world of Warcraft for the first time everything felt a lot more impressive. I had a lot more of an emotional connection with the game. It’s all a lot more numb now.
---
That was sadly only a thing on pservers.
---
I lived on Guam for 2 years on DSL internet and wow was one of the few games I could play without noticing the latency totally screwing me. You’ll be fine. But be prepared to be way off from server time.  Makes it good for farming tho bc everyone’s asleep lol
---
Dual spec and LFG were not launch features of Wrath.
---
I fookin messaged some lads that I'd 60 Magetank their RFD and they ignored me.
---
Welcome to PvP servers. Everything escalates. Some of my guildies were complaining about people camping right outside the instance to SM dungeons, so I went there and cleaned up. Some horde brought either his main or a guildy 60 rogue, camped him. They brought another 60, so I got another 60 to come. We killed them. They brought 6 60s. We thought, nah it's not worth it. And left lol.
---
&gt; Rofl if you sign something without due diligence that later implicates you for fraud that's your own fucking fault
---
But are you just as bad as the person orchestrating the fraud that you can legally get punished for? The law might have to view you as such, because it can't discern between those who actually did know (hence the need for signatures etc.), but ethically it's hard to say the guy in the sinecure and the guy pulling the strings are 100% just as bad.
---
I didn't make any comment about whether it was his "own fault" for getting caught up in this shit. Obviously you accept risks when if you just sign whatever - and again, I have zero clue about anything regarding his specific situation, but neither does anyone here - but I don't believe you're exactly as bad as the person dictating the words on the page.
---
It's for raid yes, but he's still running feral for dungeons while your healer is using that gear to keep pushing through dungeons. The healer should get priority since it'll make use of it right then.
---
Play Herod Alliance, we need more of you
---
Sword spec, thrash blade proc and HoJ all reset your swing timer when they proc. Sinister strike swings can all trigger these procs, so if you happen to SS right when your mainhand was about to go off and that SS procs one of those effects, you gain the proc but lose the initial weapon swing that was about to occur since you reset the timer with the proc. So you would always want to SS immediately after the weapon swing occurs. It's a relatively small chance to happen, but it's just the min-maxing some people do to gain an edge. Tons of add-ons out there to get a swing timer on your screen, just depends which you prefer. I personally use weakauras to check mine.
---
Great job mate. Did the same here as a mage main. Had a 35 alt with max alch by then which made the gold grind much faster
---
I was correcting his 50 guilds.  It was almost 3x that amount.
---
If they turn you away for that they're the worst kind of players: people who behave and think that they're top tier players without any of the knowledge. 
---
Yes debuffs are important, but they have a priority system that will always have higher priority debuffs (like curse of elements, winter's chill etc) override lower priority ones like from weapon procs. This is why for example a warrior having deep wounds doesn't matter, it will never be taking up a debuffs slot because it's low priority
---
This is also why you never ever want an arms warrior in the raid if you're min maxing, in addition to their low damage mortal strike is considered a high priority debuff and will knock off things like curses
---
Easiest way to communicate with all those "G O T O RE T A IL" and "Y OU L O S E" spams.
---
Is that the first recipe on that server? I’ve been the sole lionheart crafter on bigglesworth horde for over a month. It’s a good life.
---
Bought one for 40g when i was around level 30g. Would also like to know if i should sell now for 300-400g or hold for the BG phase.
---
Wow nice person!
---
I stopped playing early on but do people actually have TF already??
---
"I watched a video". To be frank, I would have serious reservations about someone who rolled a hunter, now considering a druid, and is concerned about end game viability. 
---
If this is your first go at Classic, I'd wait until ZG is released and then reroll mage/warlock. Both easy classes with an easy reroll path (Mage being preferred) I would not be tanking/healing until you have an established "game sense". I would also avoid all melee classes until then as well (due to increased performance expectations this time around). Good Luck.
---
Your main spec is not what you want to be when you grow up. It's what role you are providing to the current five man group. The reason it is such.. is because if you are not currently healing then that means there's a person in your group who is a true healer, and since it is the role they are providing, they should have priority over someone else trying to gear a different spec. 
---
If you want healing gear, then buy a shitty set of greens off the AH and fill the healer role. 
---
If you ask ahead of time and the healer is alright with you  needing on specific items then I don't see harm in it in those circumstances.
---
What’s the steamwheedle rep used for?
---
Nah you can’t get it yet, but there are people with both bindings yeah.
---
It depends on your reputation, I started runecloth hand ins at 6000/12000. So I needed 27000 rep which is 540 stacks, on my server that comes to about 800g - Alliance Razorgore EU
---
Different yes, but it still definitely destroys threat
---
I bet Mooncloth Panties would sell absurdly well if they were a thing. Blizz pls, I need a way to make money as a tailor
---
Wait. Prices will only go up.
---
Perds and Core hound, nice
---
MadSeasonShow seems like a nice guy.
---
He wasn't invited to the group, so obviously that advise doesn't apply. Like duh.
---
Depends if you need the gold for anything now
---
I hope your mages aren’t using fireball to fight rag.
---
Pretty sure a bottomless wallet is a requirement to play warrior.  If you want to tank, at least.
---
No it didn't. Dual Spec was from the Ulduar patch.
---
Cross-server LFG revamp was from the ICC patch.
---
That's right. The feature everyone hates on Wrath for "ruining" WoW wasn't released until the last major patch.
---
In reality WoW wasn't ruined until Warlords of Draenor and I honestly don't think it's ever going to recover from that since it was *the* point where their whole design philosophy radically changed.
---
Trick or treating, sometimes the bag you get has candy, sometimes It has a costume rod, sometimes it has a mask
---
Im only getting amused by situations like this one!
---
Neat I didn't now that. Still means the bulk of his damage is fire, and tanks should have enough armor to mitigate the physical component of his damage output. Our tanks have not been using armor pots on our three kills either, it's simply not necessary.
---
Do you want to level tailoring to 300 again later? Bloodvine will be bis
---
Considering I'd have to go out of my way to select it, and that wouldn't even be a thought process of mine because its irrelevant, probably not. 
---
But if for some reason the default print on something I had been using was comic sans, yeah probably.
---
But then again that would never happen, because everything is default either Arial or TNR.
---
Goblin is think the only appropriate race they added. Literally the only one.
---
All the races added after vanilla: Draenei, Blood Elves, Goblins, Worgen, Pandaren, Nightborn, Lightforged Draenei, Void Elves, Kul Tirans, Maghar Orcs, Zandalari Trolls, Highmountain Tauren, Dark Iron Dwarves, Mechagnomes, Vulpera
---
This does put a smile on my face.
---
I think you would want to flip them, raptor strike first then auto shot, so when the macro attempts to fire it will check if raptor strike is usable before firing an auto. But I'm not certain with how Hunter deadzone works whether it's doable.
---
Never ganked lowbies before but I’ve decided to start now
---
&gt; gatekeeping
---
Ew
---
Opinion discarded.
---
Felstriker baby
---
Nice name “Nigma” lmao
---
As your tanks get more geared you can go harder. 
---
Just look at the threat meter and dont go wild at the start.
---
I guess have fun crying and whining.  Blizzard launched classic due to fucking the game up listening to blowhards like yourself.
---
What do warriors hard counter other than a rogue who is afk lol
---
not saying it’s necessary. just a choice of some guilds.
---
N

I

---
&gt;Classic and its goal should not be min maxing or rushing to 60. I wish more people would just slow down and take the time to enjoy the journey but I am a strong believer in play how you want. 
---
That's how I want to play too. I'm at 11 days /played but lvl 56 and the most common reaction I get is "wow you level slow, here are some things you can do to speed up". And then there are the dungeons, where people will flame and kick if you don't clear it in under an hour by doing bosses and pulls a certain way.
---
I personally think that this is because WoW is identical to vanilla and so no one tries to explore anymore and would rather listen to the pserver bozos. Blizzard could do more to prevent this, like revamp some quests or balance some talents, IMO.
---
back then I was in a few raiding guilds and we did FFA instead of ML because there was a rumor that sometimes ML bugs out and doesn't work
---
i forgot if you’re 60 already on this sub you play wow too much. instead you should be browsing this sub and enjoying the screenshots of conversations people had while playing wow.
---
Don't sweat it ,have fun and persistence and you will kill him!
---
As an officer; I would like all the guild functionality from retail (except levels and abilities). Better management, guild calender, all that jazz
---
We just need more healers LOL
---
No one resists the shiney shoes
---
Haha, I had the same issue with my mate. He were going to WC with some random group and they needed a tank. Apparently a 60 raid geared lock can't keep threat and will die too easy.
---
I prefer people having to put in the time grinding honor, and earn the right to steamroll people.
---
What is a rank 1 bfa player? I raided mythic in bfa and pve content in classic is an absolute joke. My guild one shot rag on their first try.
---
I've done the boss several times and can confirm not obvious at all.
---
I'm a warrior and I won Truestrike Shoulders over two rogues in UBRS.
---
Soulstone more like Soul Shard
---
You dont need Any fire resistance as a mage and in raids you spam rank 1 frostbolt if you go oom (to fish for a clearcasting proc) then do Max rank frostbolt and repeat r1 frostbolt until you Get clearcasting.
---
Thanks for the very insightful discussion. Casual dismissing of people who want a few changes but not impact the overall community experience and difficulty by telling them to "go to retail" speaks volumes about your capacity to grasp nuance and overall mental maturity.
---
Great name 😀
---
This is a nice medium for difficulty. Hard enough where you cant faceroll it (retail dungeons) but easy enough where people are having fun with it.
---
in case anyone else is just stumbling upon this thread, wowhead has a good list of where to aoe grind by level here:  [https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/mage-aoe-farming-leveling-classic-wow#aoe-grinding-levels-level-30-40](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/mage-aoe-farming-leveling-classic-wow#aoe-grinding-levels-level-30-40)
---
Razorgore :)
---
To be fair, I think that tbc pservers would have been a lot more popular than classic. I think classic brings a lot to the table that tbc simply doesn't
---
It's definitely one of the rarest items in the game. Used for 39 twink bracket. If you hold on to it for 6 months to a year, you may be able to find someone who will buy it for 500-1000g, maybe more.
---
If you want cash now, you could probably find a sniper or patient reseller that will pay 100-200g.
---
No. It runs on an entirely different graphics API and the gamma is completely fucked in those screenshots.
---
Fair nough then, good on ya.
---
This was super helpful in grinding for them elem bracers solo thank you.
---
Somehow I scored the name animetiddies so had to go female but usually play as dudes
---
If you want a PvP server that horde are for once outnumbered on come to Heartseeker. For levels 55-60 the alliance outnumber horde 83% to 17%. Just don't come if you plan to go alliance ;)
---
Idk other people's take on this but if I'm tanking, I'll take the tank gear and if the healer doesn't want it, the healing gear. If I strictly want healing gear then I'd just heal. If I don't have enough gear to heal, I'd tank and eventually get enough fairly easily since not everyone needs every piece that drops.
---
some pvp items were better than some phases of pve content. so if you got glad gear you could skip the first raids. I prefer raiding to be a source of gear for pvp. not the other way around. also claiming bc had perfect balance is pretty laughable. vanilla doesn’t have perfect balance either and I agree good balance can be fun. but i prefer the vanilla pvp with crits. pvpers in vanilla also aren’t forced to raid. you need to spend way more time but the top pvp gear is generally better than the top pve gear.
---
Probably for a reason. Tho as a healer you can pretty much go from lvl 55. Simply because healers don't have to deal with missing because they are low lvl
---
I’m about 20 runs in too,
---
Never even see the neck drop ):
---
Deaf people can actually enjoy music though, the vibrations are still felt throughout the body
---
Well ok I have never actually been there so I wasn’t to aware that fire didn’t do much to them. The more you know.
---
2nd recipe on Horde side on our server. I think the Alliance has 2 or 3.
---
Weakaura
---
Kiddos, probably. /shrug
---
lol I know the guy doing this
---
Do you understand shitposting?
---
Kirtonos seems very well balanced
---
The hunters and druids in my guild usually have no one to roll against and just get handed loot at the minimum DKP bid
---
MC PuG is an example for me because MC is *not supposed* to be puggable. But because the solution (or recipe as someone else called it) is all already there, a normally difficult dungeon becomes simple.
---
What you interpret as panic casting could be his version of just simply killing a mob. So what? Not sure what your point is here or how that would deem someone as a “bad” player...
---
Thank you, I know. I was just getting hit with nostalgia
---
No, because I like to do dungeons. Guides usually show xp paths soloing and questing till 60. Questie is all I need!
---
You will betray your friends.
---
Prebis should be mooore than fine
---
No, as Mage you won’t be wanding as much as a priest or warlock
---
We took our Priest friend through BRD when she hit lvl 47.
---
In that first run, she got:
---
Kentic Amice from Interrogator.
---
Cyclopean Band from Arena.
---
Pantaloons from Fineous.
---
Omnicast Boots from Golem Lord.
---
And just to top it off, the Flameweave Cuffs of Healing from Incendius.
---
A geared warrior with a pocket healer can be devastating in bgs

Cool picture! I think this working really depends on the couple. Worked in the wedding business for a while and a lot of these "funny" toppers aren't really funny when you look at how the couple interacts. Laughing off budding resentment over conflicts in lifestyle and priorities can only work for so long. The toppers that are the best are ones that aren't so adversarial. One was the bride and groom both cuddled up on a little couch, watching their favorite show and it was great. Great couple, too.

Booo wendy. Booo.
---
how does this require confirming? you confirm that you’re also unable to figure out obvious things? just think for second why this would be done.

It is in the comments

Back when wow whas square shaped.

At your level you should buy a lesser magic wand off the AH or from an enchanter, the mats cost around 5 silver on my server. Cloak isn't important, you'll find upgrades as you level.
---
Lesser Magic Wand can be purchased on the Auction House for less than 10 silver. This will last until level 13. Then you can purchase a Greater Magic Wand which will last quite a while. I didn't replace mine until I got Gravestone Sceptar from BFD. 
---
Any enchanter can make those first two wands for you.
---
You're wrong about stuff not being solved in pservers, actually.

Same!!!
---
almost every item has buffed stats from the dungeon patch (1.10 it was i think).
---
That's right, everyone gets reduced xp.
---
Shadow Priests fall off on damage meters because they have mana issues. If a Shadow Priest goes 100% without caring about threat (like on Ragnaros) they do really well up until the point they run out of mana, which will be way earlier than any Mage or Warlock.
---
Well classic isnt the same game, for one the DM tribute buffs were nerfed and layering is in place. So this post makes no sense.
---
Winterspring at 57ish I believe. I'm not a huge pet freak tho so if anyone else could chime in that would be great.
---
More 25 man raids.
---
Tell me what makes the game good then.
---
Yeah exactly, way too late. By that time i already have ze broken teeth
---
Got mine 60% mount at lvl 45
---
Got the 100% at lvl 55
---
I feel you bro ;-)

Classic sucks

&gt;OP is simply pointing that out and acknowledging that there are some good obvious fixes out there that can't be implemented because of some arbitrary rules from a hypocritical nochanges cult who are already playing classic+
---
Just bad.
