My girlfriend knows I like / play video games. I’ve toned it down significantly since we have been living together (3 years now and going strong, yay) because I’ve just been busy doing young adult stuff (job, chores, other non-WoW bullshit) and I’m honestly a little nervous to see how she reacts to me in my WoW zone....
---
Oh yeah I can already tell this is true lol was glancing at it earlier and I saw something about taurens being able to learn plainsrunning. Which was another form of a free mount but you just ran fast as hell XD. Was removed in 1.10
---
Honestly don't. Maybe get it out of your system for a weekend or two but there's nothing funny or cool about a grown man losing a significant chunk of his life to something so stupid
---
I just feel like it’s a quicker way to find a group than going into general chat and shouting for a while.
---
I got you fam XD (not really cause idk how to do that) lol
---
I did something similar with a buddy in BC he bought me my 5000k epic flyer and it took me awhile to pay him back haha. 
---

---
I never got the gold returned. Just a life lesson on borrowing money
---
Lol knew this comment would come. In no way, shape, or form do I actually plan on get any sort of server/ world first  though.
---
Orc mount...easily da best.
---
The cruel barb... that purple fang armor set, the fishing hat! Those god damn engineering goggles. I’m having the best flashbacks.....
---
[removed]
---
Oh sweet summer child
---
I mean... I kind of get what you're saying but you're delusional if you think the sole way to a classic TBC server will be levelling through classic vanilla server.
---
Ayee i do too lol
---
Well that was a symptom of a larger problem. If you keep nerfing the content into oblivion such that you can blow through entire expansions in a day or 2 then no shit will zones be empty.
---
It has it's moments in raids, it gets a big +healing bonus and is super efficient if you can actually hit 5 people with it. It's just those times are rare in PvE and pretty much non existent in PvP. If it hit the whole raid it would be absurdly strong.
---
It was a kind act, yes. But you were not kind. 
---
You didn’t provide help since he asked... you provided help to spite other guildies.
---
I mean how cool would it be to play a game that adds content overtime. But leveling stays the same difficulty, no heirlooms, no lvlboosts, no transmog, no flying mounts in azeroth, no raid or groupfinder, no heroics. Just the game as it was meant to be without "easymode".
---
Aw crap, thought the line would auto refit but I see it didnt. - my bad. I'll play with some of these data and get a new set of graphs ready around the 80,000 sub mark (probably within two weeks or so). Thanks for the feedback!
---
"How lucky will I be in getting the drop?"
---
Pretty nice for execute phase tho due to the fast speed, no?
---
Shouldn't it say "my death awaits for a horde player"
---
Yeah its definitely viable. It does start getting quite worse though with an abundance of hitrating suddenly available (chrom boots, nef ring, dft,
---
R12 pant, etc). Aq is where it becomed a lot more noticable as dw flies ahead, and then ofc in naxx with free nutty maces etc
---
Ahh its all pretty convoluted. Altruism is like hella not black n white
---
That has very little to do with skill. But okay.
---
Nope and if you space out your roots you can irritate people to no fucking end, flag carriers, healers trying to keep up, randoms running by in AV. It's so much fun and then when theyre mad enough to fight you turn it into an endurance race.
---
One thing I've always wondered. How does the poop sock actually work?
---
 Is there some kind of frame you use to hold it open or do you just use your hands and hope for the best?
---
And where do you put the toilet paper? Do you shove it in the sock as well?
---
Level 5 wands sell and help with leveling.
---
Sort of. No vanilla zone is actually 1-60, but all starter zones scale 1-20 so in theory you could cycle through them all before moving on. There's still restrictions in place, but from lvl 20-60 you have a lot of freedom in the zones you can go to.
---
You can see the new restrictions here https://wow.gamepedia.com/Zone_scaling
---
World PvP is completely different than battlegrounds PvP. All of my favorite PvP moments were in the world.
---
Google it?
---
I mean, you can't win all the time, but despite the mobility issues, shaman is mostly a mana battle.  They can't damage you without spending mana, either to catch you or cast.  You need to make them earth shock those heals, it feels frustrating, but that's mana they aren't spending on more efficient damage, and it's keeping them out of Regen(hopefully they aren't smart enough to rank one it).  Make them Purge you, you can't just assume they will do it and give up.  Cast rank one bow to see if they Purge it.  You're on it for the long game, so it's important to keep a shaman casting.  If that means trying to run so they're forced into gw or forced to frost shock, all the better.  If they frost shock, heal, if they gw, get some swings in.  
---
I hate pally btw, but for some reason I still take pleasure in holy/prot healing in PVP.  You quite often get in these situations in wpvp. One of my most memorable moments is a +5 or so lock ganking me and getting cocky while I burnt down his pet.  I never touched him and by that time I could do nothing but spam fol between fears until he had oomed himself and had to start life tapping... Too late he realized that like pallies, warlocks outrun no one.  Tap, fear, immune.  DR is a bitch.  Tap, curse, wand while I beat him with my 1h.  Eventually he has to tap one last time and try to fear again to finish me off... Hoj is off CD, crunch, melee, pray.   He had already started casting fear again when he finally went down.   Slowest most intense battle I have possibly ever been in.
---
Serpent sting lol. Why do people so clueless insist on giving advice haha
---
I’ve played wow since 2005, and only have seen a GM in game once. It was in TBC sometime and it was a human model with the blue robes. I remember I was at the WSG queue npc when I saw him in the /yell chat and I looked up. They made their character the size of a world boss then started shooting off fireworks, it was pretty awesome tbh
---
Might be a dumb question but will Classic stop progressing at a certain point? I quit Wow after BC and from what I read, modern WoW is pretty trash in comparison. Will Classic stop at a particular expansion?
---
We’ll be using TS.
---
Shun....shun the nonbeliever...
---
On average, how long do some of these recipes take to acquire?
---
I've never personally used one but I'd imagine you just hope for the best. Anything other than that I'd consider a normal toilet.
---
As far as toilet paper, just shove that shit out the window. It's just paper and will dissolve over time.
---
Offer for her to join you, and see if she likes it too!
---
LoL! The first time through I didnt AH at all. This time I will. It will be interesting to see how much that changes the dynamic.
---
Undead male or female? I like the cleaner look of females but their are so scrony and they sit so dumb on their mounts, all the way to the front. I love casting animations of both. Male has the better running animation. I think gear looks better on fem, except for the weapons. Whatamigunnadoooo.
---
Apparently there was a missing persons report filed for him.
---
No idea why this is downvoted. It's true. Sign up and hope you get picked. Maybe they check if you played in real vanilla for bonus points or if you have certain pc specs to test on.
---
yes, shaman water-walking. and yes, it worked on mounts.
---
Tauren?
---
Which level bracket is best for warrior and warlock (separately)?
---
 Shun....shun the nonbeliever...
---
I really hope he returns for Classic.
---
Of course. Need that warstomp
---
Red defias mask and +2 beast slaying on weapons at all times
---
I see your second-hand, beat up strategy guide and raise you first and second edition strategy guide and dungeon companion kept from when I played [Vanilla WoW](https://imgur.com/a/x7rpn8A)
---
My goal is to have multiple people in my guild make Tauren shaman twinks at level 39. Imagine like 5 of those babies in AB.
---
No she won't suck balls if you don't farm.
---
Is it? 5-7 hrs over the weekend plus another 2-3 hrs 3 or 4 or so nights during the week days? I guess 10-15 is probably more accurate. Frequently less than 15.
---
Plenty of people who "have lives" spend more time than that watching TV/ netflix.
---
I don’t know much about locks but I think the shadowbolt spam would break fear constantly
---
Never seen more people want IBS.
---
In classic I'm pretty sure it was tied to server time.
---
Awesome! glad you enjoyed it. druid is so fun
---
Now that’s what I call USING YOUR MIND.
---
The player base didnt change.. They drove 85% of them away and the 15% left liked the shitty changes they made.
---
Oooooooo nice. Is second edition just updated? Any idea what patch it refers to? BTW, I fold.
---
God no please.
---
Something is magical about vanilla zones. I never got the same feeling in later expansions.
---
29 is the best bracket imo
---
The easiest way to get the Warbear patterns is Timbermaw rep. This can be a fair grind in Felwood and Winterspring, since you have to kill a lot of hostile Furbolgs. However, the two critical things you'll have to watch out for are enemy players if you're on a PvP server, and not killing the Timbermaw Furbolgs, since you start as hostile to them.
---
Idk do you think my wife should be ok with me all of a sudden playing video games 30+ hrs a week like I did when vanilla was around?
---
It's not like she said it in a condescending way. Just she knows how much I used to play this game.
---
Yeah I love that too. Adds a lot more thought to what you're doing when you got so many ranks to choose from. Instead of one flashheal you got 5 flashheal to choose from for different situations. I always love the same concept when it comes to using a low rank frostbolt to apply chill effect as the slow is still the same, but mana and casttime differ. The complexity is awesome!
---
Missing the boat from the wetlands to hillsbrad.
---
Second edition is something after 1.9, since it includes Greater Blessings for Paladins. It's essentially a guide that works perfectly for patch 1.12, so it's THE strategy guide for Classic WoW, whenever it releases. The original Brady guide even shows Paladins having Crusader Strike and Holy Strike, which were removed shortly before the launch of the game.
---
He’s so wholesome I love him
---
I at the ripe age of 14 and not knowing wtf i was doing, I begged my cousin who showed me the game to lend me the gold...
---
Good dude
---
Why was it sad? 
---
If roles reversed I'd be concerned if she started playing a video game 30+ hrs a week.
---
But not quicker than having a friends list full of buddies to run dungeons with
---
Nice find
---
I always liked the idea of Role playing  banking or merchant guild on a rp-pvp realm.  GIve out loans, but if people fail to make payment you out contracts out for them to get ganked by alliance/horde.
---
This guy got me into playing pally &lt;3
---
I've seen a decent amount of comments and posts from people who have never played ever (including myself) so I think it will bring in new players, but I'm sure the majority by far will be people who have played at some time before.
---
That's like...so not something to be proud of
---
You should try to get lvl cap with it and team up with the neutral pandaren.
---
I think most people would just think it’s a toy. There’s lots of appearance affecting toys in game.
---
I think a lot of people are gunna roll lock and abandon them. Especially after knowing how much of a pain it is having soulshards taking up half your already small inventory. Making a million health stones one by one. Summoning one by one. Spellstones, soulstones. Being curse bots that can't shine cause they have to buff elements for mages and can't use their dots cause of 16 debuffs. And how gear reliant they are. 
---
At least that's what I hope. Cause I'm going warlock and hate playing the class that is too 2-3 most popular.
---
Why richard? Just cause dick?
---
I have a few keybindings for my keypad that I use. 
---
I don’t use many addons, mainly replicating the autoloot that will come with classic, and keeping track of XP gain information.  No macros.
---
Witch! He has burning crusade and WotLK!
---
We're going to have a lot of tourists at first because of the shared subscription
---
I expect we’ll see a pro guild or two do exactly this and several experienced runners have all the tricks down to a fine art.
---
11 year old me are you me?
---
I used to watch the shit out of these videos
---
we don't know if legion was close to sub peak, it was rumored that they hit 10mil again like WOD did, but blizzard denied those rumors. You could argue blizzard denied it because they had already stopped reporting numbers, but it doesn't change the fact that they denied it and so the safe bet is that no, it didn't hit 10mil so it wasn't close to WOTLK's 12mil peak.
---
You forgot a whole were your penis goes threw so your friend can get the full experience from both...
---
Yeah, as in making dungeon drops better than bwl gear. So far theyre not adding in 1.10 items until aq drop, so thats good at least
---
I always liked the 1h animations though. I thought I my undead warrior looked pretty cool as fury lol.
---
Hasn’t this one got bc and cata included? I’m dilute because I fail bought this one also, you want the one with a NE and dwarf on the cover
---
I'm sure Classic will be the most played game in the world as well as the most watched on Twitch for a while man.
---
To be honest I intend to stop and smell the roses with my pally, and just goof around with my buddies. There’s a fair bit of nostalgia involved there and all the XP meters will be turned off 👍
---
As an alliance I have the same experience with the horse attacking me almost always overleveled or with better numbers.
---
That's just a fact of wpvp. Not related to faction. You really think people who play horde have an innate sense of wpvp honor that alliance players automatically lack? Lolz that's just blind fanboyism.
---
bgs don't give EXP so the only concern really is accidentally discovering too many zones for the bonus exp.
---
It's not really my place to decide who is in charge of your free time.
---
My experience so far is to operate your melee class two levels higher than the guide. It’s slower, but reduces the amount of misses and increases crits and up times. I’m still levelling melees to see how it pans out at higher sections. I’m not a melee expert by any means so it makes for a good ‘average player’ test.
---
Terrokar in general is terrific for Herbalists. Skettis in particular. I would farm the Forest-Ragers all day. Got the epic flyer in no time flat.

GM tools on private servers are part of the emulation software and don't necessarily reflect what tools were actually available to GMs during retail vanilla

---
Dun morough and loch modan are possibly my favorite alliance zones. I miss doing them. I retired my ally and went to horde middle of tbc and have never gone back. Ally is looking ever so tempting to me this xpac.
---
hi, you (and any other interested warlocks) should join us and discuss this at the [Classic Warlock Discord](https://discord.gg/3fvUDqF) :)
---
to answer your question: you can go very heavy destruction for pvp. some popular variants are 7/7/37 and 5/7/39.
---
you will not be using much shadowbolt because it is a very long cast time and your talents improve fire damage, not shadow. searing pain, immolate, and conflag are your primary damage dealers. if you run with a succubus, soulfire is your primary nuke while you have someone CC'd.
---
regarding professions: for pvp, nobody recommends enchanting. tailoring is fine but you absolutely want to have engineering. mining/engi is a decent choice if you want a source of income.
---
Yeah I'd agree. 
---
Cheers - have a good night.

Don’t forget there’s another link here on this thread for a free guide as well, which is not mine but Brian Kopp’s and also does a good job.
---
Thanks for explaining your position, but I dont think anyone should roll need on a bis item to pay for their epic mount.
---
The definition of misunderstood. Good explanation. Too bad the other guy has up votes and you don't
---
Trust me, Horde are the exact same, and many of them often love corpse-camping too.
---
19 hunter twink is where its at.  You can literally one shot some non-twink players sometimes and if you group with other twinks, there is no competition.
---
Rogue is fun but with 2 to 3 twink hunters, you can essentially shut down entire zones.  Camping their spawn point becomes boring as well.
---
??? Gimp is a pretty good photo editing program is it not?
---
Agreed. I read it exactly as how Jarvan yells it when he ults in League of Legends.
---
I'd only farm there super late at night cause I didn't wanna get into fights with the Horde.
---
And all mine were in BG's. PvP in the open world were the worst moments, it just got in the way of what I actually wanted to be doing at that point.
---
People are just different and have different preferences. Would love it if people stopped shitting on PvE'ers who have been enjoying the game since Vanilla too.
---
I like both but I feel more at home being Horde.
---
I look forwards to getting ganked during an escort by some guy that's 10 levels ahead of me and later on at max get revenge for what he did. I'm looking at you Dave.
---
I’m a UPS driver too who plans to play classic casually. I do worry about how much free time I’ll have but I will be able to play on weekends at least.
---
Also you can ask Hobbs on his twitch
---
its warcraft not honorcraft
---
Play both.  Name the human Before and the undead After.
---
This just reminded me that aoe-looting is gone.
---
Prepare your middle fingers for maximum clicking.
---
I just cant wait to be in my first dungeon group that falls apart because of a wipe, and a retail player acts as if that's not expected. Or the first time we are genuinely lost in sunken temple.
---
I was level 70 and wanted Epic flying but I was a broke boy and also in middle school. Transitioning to high school I slowed down WoW and didn't play in a week or so. Next time I try and login I can't. I contact Blizz and had to fill out a form and get it notarized to prove it was me. I log back in and my bags are full of herbalism mats and I have epic flying. Thanks gold farmers!
---
there's nothing wrong with playing video games at any age, stop being an old fart saying things like "Children should be doing completely different things" instead of playing video games.
---
Like path of exile. I like it.
---
Why even play classic at that point?  Why not just play retail if you want all those things?
---
The light is my strength.
---
Alliance, as that is what I played during classic the first time around.
---
Atleast you were dwarf master race
---
[Not really a pdf but here.](https://archive.org/details/World_of_Warcraft_World_of_Warcraft_BradyGames_Official_Strategy_Guide)
---
Horde side you need those dank warsong boots in ashenvale [warsong supplies ](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?quest=6571)
---
Because as a hunter, you dont do top 10 on meters and your job is not do push max damage, its to provide aura, wolf pet to melee and dispell enrage.  
---
But a Mage tops meters, and are a very strong dps.
---
You'll never want to go back to BfA after playing Classic. In my mind Classic is Witcher 3 and BfA is Farmville, that's how different they are.
---
Genuinely not trying to be rude, but hasn’t this list been made in several other fonts/formats? What’s new about this one?
---
Lol you have shown all the signs of someone who has a mental disorder. I wish you luck, don't stop taking your meds
---
Druids are ridiculously fun and can be good enough at everything to play whatever spec you want outside of raiding which is a bit more particular for... every class anyway. Shifting is such a unique and enjoyable mechanic, especially if you play on a PvP realm.
---
3 step process. #1. Show her the Hunter class #2. Show her Petopia (the website) #3. As sometime else mentioned, encourage her to play on her own too. When you play with someone else who knows all the quests, you miss out on a lot of the leveling 'experience'.
---
I've been planning on going horde this time around (alliance during vanilla) and I'm still leaning toward horde, but now I kinda want to play paladin...or hunter. Or priest.
---
Basically I don't know wtf I want. If Classic had launched 2 months ago I'd be a content shaman spamming frostshawk, but instead I'm waiting, and doubt besets me.
---
Eh I just find no enjoyment in going into a fight I know I will win.
---
After 14 years Horde, starting fresh with Alliance this time around.
---
I think it’s fine so long as you also AH worthy items instead of vendoring them. That’s a bigger habit I have to break, but maybe a half decent auction UI will encourage that.
---
Doesn't change the fact that GMs have been doing stuff like that for years.
---
I like both but will go horde cause in my soon 15 years of playing this game I could never get over how much I love the undead male animations. Call me an edgelord if you want, I just love them to death (heh). Close second for me is human male so I'm glad deviate delight exists.
---
going alliance this time because im bored of horde cities (love undercity tho) and i want to try something new
---
That starting zone truly is amazing.  
---
I wish we had stealth cows, because I'm rolling rogue this time around
---
It really came off as you were asking for permission.
---
For meme?
---
I used it for real and it was really good lol
---
It was more me telling her my plan and being surprised at how on the same page she was already.
---
&gt;getting groups as a mage is about as easy as it is for healers
---
technically, but when like 40% of your faction is a mage not really
---
It's the perfect crime!
---
City of York
---
Beforecrush and Aftercrush? Seems like warrior names though.
---
Yes, all of Battle.net will be compatible with classic
---
30's bracket druid 100%, flag running with no mounts? Ahhh... good times.
---
I think undead has the best casting animation. The cast with the finger point is on point.
---
Why Human over Dwarf as Shadow Priest ?
---
This is true for the first edition game guides. But Brady games also released a second updated edition towards the end of Vanilla, it appears to be much more up to date with 1.12.
---
Yeah 30s and 40s brackets were by far the most fun to me. Particularly when I played my first rogue way back in the day. Unlocking kidney shot and cold blood in the 30s was a grand ol' time.
---
F
---
For the extra dps trinket. Human racial is a pvp medallion.
---
Those don't exist everywhere though. That's the point he's making
---
I hope so, but I recently read a post about ranking your favorite expansions and I saw a lot of Legion, Cata and MoP at the top of the lists so I don't know what to think anymore. People seem to like "WoW: The Singleplayer Game with online elements with no need for social interaction and modes where it's literally impossible to lose. Oh and you also level up a neck and stuff because we couldnt think of any better gimmick this time and we already gave out the coolest weapon in our lore to drooling level 101 players last year".
---
Why are the trees speaking Vietnamese?
---
it is not, human racial is just stealth and Hpriest feedback and selfheal, dwarf is blind dispell and Dpriest fearward, selfheal
---
In that case, that's great.
---
As I checked the rest of this thread I saw that some others had the same idea, it was probably the wording.
---
18+
---
I hear you there, for sure! Have you ever tried any AH addons?
---
We can see ur penis
---
Humans don't get that racial til WotLK
---
Okay this is a very strange questions but I have to give it a shot and hope you respond. I want to name my character some from of Lobsterdick (inside joke). Now obviously thats against tos. I was wondering if you had a recommendation that wouldn't get be banned/name changed. Is there any variation of the word dick that would be kosher?
---
On private servers it's usually about 18% or so.
---
Trying to heal on world bosses was wild. Sometimes you had no idea if your heal even went off.

Oh shit oh shit oh shit *scrambles phone in hands* how do I delete this?!?!
---
Complete opposite, a fast speed mainhand weapon is only good for tanking because you can spam Heroic Strike really fast (an ability that replaces your regular auto-attack). Execute is just on the GCD so a slower weapon is good.
---
Demo Shout with Booming Voice and Split that leatherwearing edgelord in two pieces... You're a warrior! ... I think(?)
---
When I consistently played retail, yeah, auctioneer probably.
---
I’ll probably get one in classic, but I don’t think it’s necessary on my first journey to 60 or anything, so long as the default UI for auctions are better than Vanillas. Same thing with mailboxes, I won’t get a mail addon if the mail functionality isn’t like Vanilla.
---
Oh, please do elaborate on that one. I'd love to hear your expert opinion on the "signs of someone who has a mental disorder" on internet message boards. Is being a total toolbag while hilariously trying to tell everyone else to grow up and get help one of them, you think? Let's see how many more of your posts can get nuked by the mods today.
---
Yeah I could have worded it better.
---
Those were decent expansions and for people who start playing in wraith they would probably rank those as top. Hence why wraith babies would vote that way
---
It’s this simple, alliance have better questing, more beautiful towns, better starter zones. 
---
Horde have the actual better looking models. 
---
I’d sacrifice all of the Ali perks to not play, extra short midget, floppy ears dildo elf man, extra short midget and my distant relative was a canine humans.

Definitely make a character you can play with her. But let her take the lead in exploring and let her soak in the experience. 
---
Put my wife off wow by trying out a pserver with here and my bro. We just zerged to everything and she wasn't able to keep pace with us.

&gt; I think he missed the "war" part in WarCraft :P
---
Classic WoW to WOTLK is more like 'intense border strugglecraft' The war doesn't offically spark up until Cata/MoP.
---
 But hard mode on a PvE server. Flag up 24/7. Congratulations, You've just made everyone on the enemy faction a rogue.

500% truth!

Fucking right

But then you'll be stronk and can fight off would be gankers!
---
Still another 90-100+ days of blueballing left my dude. Pick up another great game meanwhile like Witcher 3, Bloodborne or Dragon Quest XI.
---
I highly doubt that. I'm sure we'll see 200-300k viewers watching Classic the first week or so, but sadly think it'll die down quickly. 
---
I can't imagine Classic will be the most played either, not with games like Fortnight and what else people play. 
---
Don't get me wrong though - I'd love to see it happen, the more new players for Classic the better in my opinion.
---
Why?
---
You raise really good points, but I believe the reason why they keep pushing in that direction is due to how deep they are in with their philosophy and the types of players it has generated/maintained over the yeats. Unless they introduce classic WoW elements slowly/one-at-a-time, the amount of pro-classic players that could return will likely equal the amount of modern-day players who would leave due to them being used to the changes of the previous 5 expansions. 
---
If anything, Blizzard can use the metrics of old vs new players playing Classic to determine how viable reverting to Classic features would be. Or at the very least, we'll still have Classic c:
---
Weapons and Red Defias Mask are all you should care about.
---
Even an item with +16 agi isn't worth the time investment.
---
"Right click?" I think they mean "right cluck."
---
Could be hunter/ sham sham
---
It depends. I started in Wrath and have the most fond memories playing it out of every expansion but at the same time haven't been as excited for a game in years as I am for classic.
---
I was wondering this. Thank you for the confirmation.

You could however level (very slowly) through PvP by turning in marks  at the repeatable quest in vanilla (prior to battlemasters -- I don't remember how it changed after). First turn-in gave more xp and some cash, all turn-ins after gave a reduced amount that converted to like... 1/3-1/2 of a bar of xp.   
---
You could only hold 20 marks at a time so if you were already say, level 29 and most of the way to 30, you would save up 20 marks and as many in their mailbox as possible (mailbox marks expired within 24 hours of receipt), then turn them all in when you felt like leveling up.   
---
I remember leveling 30-39 through WSG exclusively, while my rival on horde did the same. We probably played 200 WSG matches against each other in that bracket alone haha.
---
This is too real
---
Practice patience. This will be your biggest asset. Try to rush, and you won’t have a very fun time.
---
Grinding mobs on rested xp is more efficient than questing.
---
My first few hours in WoW started with me and my friend rolling characters on release day. I had a warlock and he had a priest. The servers were so laggy that we were testing our pings by using /fart by seeing how long it would take for the emote to show up.
---
Oh the good ol' days.
---
I played horde in vanilla and want to go back for nostalgia. I played alliance from TBC onward so it would be new to me to play Alliance, but back in vanilla the diversity of races on alliance is crap(all just a shorter/taller or purple human). Plus human racials are just way too damn strong for all the classes I'd want to play, so I'd feel forced to play one when I don't like their animations.

Telling the wife is easy, telling the kids is the hard part.  Daddy needs 6 months off from you children.  I love you.  I really do.  But my home is in Azeroth
---
Yeah, but I don’t necessarily want them to just rehash what made Classic good. It can be It’s own new flavor of MMO. Blizzard reinvented the MMO game once before, they can do it again. It’s a lot of work though, and probably more risky than coasting on a steady lower (but still massive) sub number and micro transactions

&gt;  Corehound belt from Thorium Brotherhood in BRD isn't really needed I don't think
---
Corehound is BIS leather waist until T3.  The only other better option is Grasp of the Old God from Cthun which is cloth
---
&gt; The ~~easiest~~*ONLY* way to get the Warbear patterns is Timbermaw rep.
---
You had to have the rep to learn the pattern in Vanilla.
---
I'm tribal LW on a pvt server.  I didn't level in Searing Gorge so missed all the rep quests for Thorium Brotherhood.  I didn't grind Timbermaw rep.
---
I did grind Cenarion Circle rep which came in handy for Sandstalker NR gear pre AQ opening.
---
Bought devilsaur recipes

Why kick her out? Just game out in the garage or something

 "Did you think we had forgotten? Did you think we have forgiven? Behold the terrible vengeance of the Forsaken!" What a great line.
---
If the reckless driving doesn't kill you the horde will! Win win!
---
Wow is boring as fuck to watch others play.
---
Reserving items will be the cancer in Classic.
---
Those graphics and the UI. That looks like BFA and not vanilla. Vanilla didnt have the mini bar icons on the right like that. The pavement is too crisp and detailed looking to be vanilla.
---
I have always been a Horde main. I played a Undead Warrior back in the day, I definitely was the 14 year old edgelord. But I grew to love Undercity, Org and TB. 
---
I have since then started playing Orc instead and I plan to roll an Orc warrior once again when Classic is out.
---
While both of those classes seem to get better the later the game goes, I do remember level 19 warlocks being stupid when they went and got Gravestone Scepter from the BFD quest (basically a lvl 29 weap). Instant dots, then wand everyone to death while having a stupid amount of hp.
---
Oh right, for some reason I was thinking of lava belt.
---
&gt; roping  
---
Holy shit I read it wrong
---
"Make sure you always remind alliance pf their poor faction choice" lmao
---
You can also clearly see draenai hooves in the upper left corner of the screen
---
Maybe if you're a level 34 noob in greens with 17 days played. But full t3? BiS? Rank 13+? So fucking worth it
---
I think that one was included in one of the first battle boxes?
---
So I should go dwarf?
---
The forsaken piss me off sometimes.
---
Yeah that's really worth throwing two years away for.
---
go with what you think looks best ofc, but if you are asking what is better dwarf is :)
---
My version of this guide spans from vanilla to wotlk
---
With Divorce papers.
---
Good luck finding a guild that can fill all eight groups with shamans. Been raiding Vanilla for 5 years on pserver and never saw shamans in a caster group. Alliance locks are far more superior
---
I think that was Turalyon's line in WC2X. Still more badass than any modern alliance ruler.
---
at lvl 35-40 sword of omen from sm quest, vanquisher sword from rfd quests. beast swords
---
I know right? I got these like two months after starting on nost. I thought "This is gonna be HUGE" and honestly thought the team was going to get us to BC at least. The second edition strategy guide is totally rad and was one of the most useful resources for my hunter because their pet bestiary is easy to parse and makes finding new ranks of your pet abilities a breeze.
---
I call bullshit. AoE at level 14 with arcane explosion? Mustve been a bullshit server. No way you have the mana pool to do that effectively
---
So is Fortnite, LoL and csgo in my opinion but they're often on top on Twitch.
---
OK thanks for the heads up
---
I guarantee you they're lurking on this sub/the forums and reveling in all the speculation and salt.

The AoE party heal is tricky to use because you're always cringing about how it'll fuck with your meters. XD Definitely has its moments though but I wouldn't spec around it.  
---
As for AoE farming I just don't see it happening. Holy Nova really sucks, you can do DM East if you bring a bit of stuff but otherwise it's probably just going to be a struggle. Use your priestly charm to befriend some mages and get them to do the heavy lifting. ;)
---
Nah man there's so much popular streamers that will stream this game for more than a year dude it'll be on top for way longer than what you think.
---
Does ice barrier scale with more "spell damage" in vanilla?
---
Ganking used to have an unwritten honor code - after killing the same player so many times, you eventually let them finish, or even assisted them. Hell, I even remember a mage who used to kill me (warrior) every chance he got. Then one day, I'm running along, and there he is, AoE farming and low on health. I was sooooo tempted to grief him, but I just ran past, since I had somewhere to be (I was enroute to an instance I think). Didn't think anything of it, until a couple days later when I was attempting to farm something myself, and he runs up, and I know I'm about to die. When I saw him coming I got kinda mad, remembering how I'd let him live, so I stance dance, 'zerker charge and think to myself "I'm not going down without a fight" - he promptly sheeps me, kills the mobs I was fighting, /wave and runs off, leaving me at full health and had finished my farming for me!  
---
(We fought again later, and I died many more times - but we never griefed eachother at low health).
---
I hate the fact of being a short dwarf with anathema but dwarf it is if that is what will be best for pvp.

---
oh ok perfect thanks
---
I've never played Classic, but seeing this makes me so excited to play it!
---
Ok so each tick of the corruption dot has a low chance to proc nightfall then? according to the wiki its 4%? seems so low
---
yeah im not a fan of the male dwarfs either, but females look very nice with animnations, if you are unsure and dont know what they look like with all emotes, and gear and what not. You can check here:  [https://classic.wowhead.com/dressing-room#Rczz0zJ89cVskmm9m87T](https://classic.wowhead.com/dressing-room#Rczz0zJ89cVskmm9m87T)
---
I know many of the top streamers like Shroud and Tim will be playing wow too, but I just don't see them streaming wow non-stop like Sodapopping and Asmongold will be doing. They came from wow, much of their core viewer base are wow fans. But that's not the case with many other streamers, and although I'd love to see it happen I just fear they'll give into their viewers and stream other games instead.
---
ok very cool
---
Yea he seems quite good, lots of shadowbolt spam, but many ppl on here are saying not to use it so I dunno haha
---
To be fair I wasn't to sure on the PvP phase times myself until I saw this. Like the guy said he just whipped it up because he saw lots of outdated lists.
---
He was turned back in vanilla, and still is a chicken to this day in retail.
---
Oh that's a good question! I don't think it did, but I could be wrong - commenting in hopes of getting an answer, too!
---
Those are indeed hunter shoulders, it is known.
---
*unzips*
---
July 16th works perfect for my schedual.
---
I never moved out of 19 why do you think 29 is the best?
---
Those shoulders were hotly contested between those three classes for sure (probably paladins too). Plate classes either just got access to plate or had a few levels before they were there, and ditto for mail classes. I remember drama pretty much every time they dropped.
---
UD females look horrid. If you have to roll a UD mage, just stick with the male version. It looks way better. Or roll Alliance mage, because they look better.

I read this before I even owned the game or a computer that could handle it.

If he does some pushups/pullups while waiting for his flightpath to land / queues to pop / boats to arrive, he could probably get away with a plain/veggie slice a day
---
You've missed the point of the post. The GM turned his character into a chicken in Vanilla and the character is still like that to this day.
---
People aren't watching the gameplay - they're there for the streamer's reactions to things, interaction with the chat, stories, etc. 
---
People watch click on a fishing spot for 8 hours straight in RuneScape and maintain thousands of viewers.
---
If you have time to use Shadow Bolt, use it.
---
Alot of the times in PvP you don't have that much time tho so that's why you use Searing Pain.
---
pvp was done so poorly
---
This
---
This is why I want to be a GM
---
Will they bring back duel welding weapons for hunters?
---
Different strokes. The only positive "world PvP" interactions I've ever had were city raids which you can also do on a PvE server if you want. There is absolutely nothing positive to me about random assholes attacking me while I'm trying to level or farm. Sure it's an adrenaline rush to kill someone who tried to murder you, but that doesn't mean I want to sign up for that service.
---
The greatest thing for me about Classic WoW is not that it's official but that we'll finally be able to have PvE servers again like the majority of players preferred back in the day. There's only a higher percentage of PvPers these days because they were pushed to private servers by the constant churn of people wishing they weren't on PvP servers on live.
---
Sounds like you're more of a PVE person (just by your reasons) so in that sense I can absolutely see your reasoning. Watching people overheal your hots, innervating OTHER healers, the occasional NS big heal and getting yelled at to BREZ BREZ BREZ by people freaking out, not my favorite. Being disallowed from using your other specs was always a bummer too, particularly when the same people who say "can't take a boomkin" also say "we could do this with 30 ppl *just as fast"*.  
---
Myself, I always loved PvP, and druids were imo the most enjoyable pvp class in the game because of the versatility and general invincibility while being mobile healers that were immune to mages bullshit.
---
I have great experiences with every xpac expect probably MoP(took most of it off guild fell apart. I regret missing it cause when I did come back it was super fun content) and WoD cause it was bad but I agree I am super excited for classic just as it is a return to good game design and the social aspect wasn't just guilds but server wide which has been missing since wraith
---
How long did the grinds you did take you?
---
So why did Varian's wife divorce him?
---
Because a guard told her King's on her friend.
---
So poor he couldn't even afford good dental care!
---
For PvP, it's so good, you won't beat rogues without it. Especially not a cold-prep rogue who has infinity stuns, and all you have is blink every 20 seconds. You can reset almost any fight with polymorph and/or Ice Block. But you'll want a macro to remove it, because people usually expect you to stay in it, and sometimes you'll need to get out early to counterspell, or keep a rogue in combat.  
---
It's also good when buying time for a healer to save you, or avoid massive boss damage in PvE. It can be used if you pull aggro and a warrior's taunt is on CD or resists.  
---
It can also break any form of CC, making it impossible for other players to keep you out of the fight, at least a little longer - especially if you spec into Arcane for Improved Counterspell, enabling you to block out of CC and then lock down an opponent caster, or sheep someone, enabling you to pick your next move.
---
YESS!! I love your videos so much. keep it up
---
I'd follow what drakedog does. Not what redditors say. 
---
If you can get a shadowbolt off without being knock backed cast it. Searing pain is used a lot but shadow bolt is the main nuke while the guy is feared or charmed by succy. 
---
Also look up Goth warlock pvp on YouTube. I believe he plays on pservers but he's still solid.
---
Yes it is staying true to the original game.
---
If it's truly kept to the starting areas/only for the first initial wave, I doubt it very much.
---
If only the lich king had such rad eyebrows.
---
Oh i was unaware that was the plan god i hope thats true
---
*runs to nearest engineer supplies vendor*
---
probably never ran into a shaman. :shrug:
---
Only? That was when the game had 12 million subscribers, it has 2-3 million now.
---
You have to understand that r/wow and mmochamp communities are in the minority here. Most 7-8 million people who quit do not post about WoW.
---
There are far more people who like the idea of a giant Tolkien esque inspired fantasy world, where you go on adventures and meet new people vs. the autistic, online hoarder who collects mogs and mounts that seem to constitute the majority of Retail's community.
---
I think plenty of new players will try the game, and its strong emphasis on classic RPG elements and the sheer dopamine it induces will manage to keep quite many of them.
---
shaman says hi
---
and goodbye
---
It’s not just the plan, it’s been stated by Blizzard. Hopefully it’s tested in the beta, along with other things like mechanics and whatnot
---
Your telling me man.. I’m gonna be stuck on deployment in the middle of the fucking ocean with no internet for 6 months when classic is supposed to be released. Shoot me.
---
The "story" of how she met a a smoking hot Tauren, and dumped your sorry, Forsaken Ass.
---
Having it in the starter areas is probably a necessary evil. 
---
Imagine being hyped for this game for so long, and then find yourself struggling to finish basic quests due to the overwhelming amount of people tagging the mobs you need.
---
When Vanilla came out, it had a sporadic release date, server downtime, bugs, and there was no "day 1" culture back done. Thus you could realistically get out of those early zones. Today, everyone will be on 12:01
---
Knowing my luck - it's gonna happen during the weekend of an anime convention Jun 13-15
---
Yep. In 1.0/1.1 broken electro lanterns off goblins in STV sold for an insane amount like 50s or something, so I farmed those for two or three hours, had enough gold for mount and full mail for my 40 shaman. It was nerfed quickly.
---
whatever the pala does, shaman is his counter and he knows it.
---
Username checks out
---
True, but spells and basic information about them were datamined or scraped from the clients before being lost.  Private servers have a pretty complete toolset and access to all the spells and items. It's things like boss mechanics, scripts, and coefficients that you couldn't get the actual data for.
---
I played on pservers since 2011, just after Cata was released and i got completely fed up with how far WoW had fallen.
---
Unlike pservers i see today, my experience back then was there were a lot MORE people then that had never played vanilla before. There were a lot more people back then that wanted to check out the old content rather than older players like me wanting the old game back. Pservers have slowly become older now and theres a lot of veteran pserver vanilla players.
---
I fully expect classic to have mostly new players.
---
It's an easy enough level for people to get to meaning the bracket is still populated, theres a little more niche items you can play around with, as well as more skills to use which is a slight increase to the skill cap.
---
A couple of reasons I can see.
---
Watching DotA or CSGO tournaments is like watching a sport
---
#truth
---
So at the bottom of GM Island there is a white room with an interrogation chair and a giant rat NPC. This seemed pretty tongue in cheek but were any players ever taken there?
---
This is possibly the most sensible response ever.
---
Wrath babies, theres a term i havent heard in a while. I see you are a man of culture.
---
&gt; it’s been stated by Blizzard
---
Actually it hasn't. They have said many things about sharding but to this day they have never actually stated that sharding will only be used at launch. The words they used strongly point to that but they have never said it.
---
Detective Sherlock over here
---
The answer is you keep refreshing this Reddit and the wow classic forum once every hour or 2 until release. At least we’re all suffering together. 
---
I actually haven’t been this hyped for a game in almost a decade now, it’s painful
---
It did, 10% according to private servers.  I'm not sure if the coeffecient is correct, but I do remember the number going up with gear.  
---
IIRC fire/frost ward and mana shield did not scale up with spell power.
---
Mage.   My wife has played a mage since vanilla and u can learn 2-5  abilities for combat and that's all you ever need.     
---
Doesnt mean they'll be any good.   But it's totally doable and my wife still loves it.
---
rogues get to pick their fights tho, which is one of the reason they're op
---
Do you use Wisdom to reduce downtime instead of Might to accelerate combat?
---
Can you use spells, equip gear, and level like normal?
---
Excited for those male orc pole dancers, right?
---
Rolling was first available in MoP and you could so that on both factions.
---
Not if it was "authentic" vanilla and everyone wiped their memory clean
---
The previous post was about him still being a chicken so he does not play it too keep the buff, this is proof.
---
Awesome
---
This is amazing.
---
purge costs a decent amt of mana, shaman would likely go OOM fairly quick.  shaman vs paladin fight is pretty boring!
---
Thanks for the confirmation.
---
Yeah I'd be curious to see how it shakes out.
---
Hunter T2 is pretty cool, I miss how imposing and yet simple the old tier sets were.
---
The problem wasn't them nerfing the content, rather they increased leveling speed to keep the time required to hit max level consistent through expansions.  It led to awkward situations where you couldn't actually finish a single zone or expansion because you would outlevel it far before you finished, hence the introduction of scaling.
---
I remember something in there about skill level for spell schools like we have for weapons. And the plainsrunning that was mentioned.
---
BFA models and the mount I somehow doubt that a GM could change the model ID of a player charter in the DB to begin with yet alone that it would survive this long.
---
So either a model replacement or a private server.
---
Case close.
---
Unless Wowhead is wrong, the Warbear Harness recipe also dropped from some mobs:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=15742/pattern-warbear-harness#dropped-by
---
However, by all accounts it's extremely rare, hence as I said, the easiest way is to grind Timberhold rep.
---
Sadly it seems like all guides are now monetized by youtube content creators. There are some
---
out there but they’re harder to find these days.
---
I remember being about 12 standing in goldshire and some night elf came up to me and gave me the twisted chanters staff. It was BiS for level 19 mage twinks, a rare drop from wailing caverns. I was so hyped to get a blue, not realising I could've sold it on AH for 100g, as a level 18 that was huge. After playing BfA I lit could not remember a single name of gear I got when leveling, but the twisted chanters staff given to me by a random night elf in goldshire still sticks in my head. One of my favourite moments from old wow.

If you pvp, super minor consideration that I sometimes think about in vanilla, is that default UI has no enemy cast bar, so average player relies on seeing your hand color to accurately kick.  
---
Offensive female UD has her left hand above her shoulder glowing, whereas UD male offensive casting both hands are down at waist level.  Both are easy enough to see on their own, but if you have another player in front of you, or if you are clipping through a bush it can be hard to see what/when the male UD is casting.
---
It's wrong.
---
I'm pretty sure that's wrong, almost 100% positive.  Some of those drop tables are inaccurate because of private server data.  There are all kinds of weird drops listed that were never actually things.
---
They just need dynamic respawns. That's what I'm more concerned about. The game will be unplayable for weeks if there's no mobs to kill.
---
Depends on streamers. The more big streamers pick it up, and stick with it, the more people will pick it up, especially teenagers. There'll also be a fair number of retail players checking it out, purely because why not, given they'll have access to it anyway.
---
Dunno why you were downvoted it's true...you end up grinding
---
Here's the thing to consider: If you are AoE'ing mobs to complete a quest, chances are either you have really good gear for your level, or the quest is green.  
---
Now, I think green quests still give the same amount of XP as a red quest (xp amount should be fixed, iirc), but the mobs give much better XP if Red/Orange than if green. However, unless you have a ton of rare/epic gear for your level, you probably won't be able to do enough damage to safely manage a ton of mobs 3/4 levels higher than you.  
---
So, you think "ok, I'll just solo kill the mobs 3 levels higher than me, so I can get the extra XP and complete tougher quests!" - NOT SO FAST, says literally anyone from the opposite faction, because now they see someone 6 levels lower than they are, and they want an easy fight (especially on the horde side - I'm not sure what it is, but if you play horde, you will want to kill anything lower level than you are. I mean, I rolled horde once and quickly found myself ganking lowbies. Not because I wanted to, but because I NEEDED to. Yet when I played Alliance, I felt the need to play with honor, and I never picked an easy fight I knew my opponent had no chance of winning).  
---
So you get ganked, then go back to lower level mobs/quests, and AoE farm them because it's more efficient to kill below-level mobs and return the favor to the other faction, ganking anyone of them stupid enough to insult you by trying to kill mobs 3/4 levels higher than they are, while you are farming mobs/quests 3/4 levels lower than you are...  
---
So yes, AoE farming IS better than questing, but the trick is to farm green quests you can easily AoE mobs down for, so you get the same XP, but the killing part goes much quicker, and you gank the opposing faction instead of getting ganked all the time!
---
Woah hold up there buddy. Do you have a license to use the brand name "W**craft"? That infringes on Blizzard's copyright.
---
Weapon speed shouldn't matter for Execute since it doesn't do weapon damage (like MS, SS, WW, Slam). If anything, I might prefer a faster weapon between 2 otherwise equal weapons so I can get faster white hits in and have a greater chance of having rage before my next Execute. But that's likely a tiny difference and not worth selecting an interior weapon over.
---
what do you think a plan turns into when you state it?
---
Streamers like Kripp and Shroud will stop streaming it after a few weeks. Soda and asmon might stick with it for a few months.
---
LFG and dual spec? That goes against the grain of Vanilla WoW. Ideas like this are dangerous and created the snowball effect that has given us retail WoW. While they may seem innocent and subtle the effects of these would ripple through the game and take away so much from the Vanilla experience, imho.
---
Play other fun games. Old Blizzard Games, some fun old school nintendo goodness, or Morrowind. Anything that scratches that old school itch.
---
Find yourself a mage buddy and a healer who want to level quickly. You won't regret it.
---
Blizzard didn’t spend 2 years making a game and setting it up so 5 million bfa players can check it out just to have a snoozefest experience where everyone waits around for 2 minutes for a mob to spawn to instantly kill and repeat for 10 hours to level.
---
Are you sure? I thought Alcor's Razor was the best Vael weapon for this reason.
---
I can't remember where I heard that though.
---
Everything Blizzard have said and done points towards them not doing progressive itemisation. Which is entirely the right move to take. Progressive itemisation rewards players who have knowledge that can only be gained from outside the game. Players should be able to figure out everything about the game by playing the game itself.
---
*remember the sunwell*
---
Nobody knows. All we know is that they have content plans up to Naxxramas. Anything past that (be it BC servers, or OSRS-styled new content in the vein of the classic gameplay) is up in the air.
---
These threads are full of twinkers patting each other on the back for how clever they are and how much fun it is going to be to ~~grief levellers with a massive gear advantage~~ have very fair and awesome PvP. You aren't wrong though.
---
I think twinking is like junk food - it's fun to do if you don't think about what you are putting in your mouth, but it will make you obese and bad at PvP if you do it too much.
---
They are overkilled in 10 AE's that's 750 mana, you also get rank 2 Intellect at lvl 14 so that's a free 7 int (105 mana), you can frost nova and wait a bit to let some mana regen as well if you don't quite have enough
---

---
No one plays on this server anymore but I enjoyed joining late and getting my rogue to this point.
---
Yeah, Tauren Warriors have only 26 Int at level 60. 26-18=8.
---
This is a really cool concept idea!
---
Dude awesome thank you!
---
Might. Even without wisdom, the kill rate is better.
---
Judgment does absolutely shit damage, so ignore it aside from once to pull (unless undead / demon, then exo to pull, then judge as it comes in)
---
Each pull is Judge, Seal, Wait. (or Exo, Judge, Seal, Wait) - it ends up being like 10% lower damage, but with 0% of time spent in recovery, it's better.
---
Although a *lot* of the changes in 2.0.1 would have been in vanilla if they hadn't rushed out TBC, were designed for vanilla and would be a huge improvement to vanilla.
---
Hopefully once Classic is out and the people who just want an officially sanctioned pirate server become a tiny minority of the Classic player base we can see some of those improvements backported to Classic.
---
The hakkari sword set is among the best weapons for execute phase in vanilla. You want fast weapons to gain enough rage be able to execute on every GCD, and that along with +6 sword skill to gain even more rage from your glancing blows is a recipe for tons of rage. Goes great with humans or warriors with edgemasters, too.
---
Fantastic list. Thanks!
---
God damnit Ilthalaine!
---
You'll strive buddy!
---
You got yours, and I got my Joana.
---
I'll probably just use it for suggestions, not too strict, I pretty much have a good grasp on what quests I like to do and what I don't for horde anyway.

Vael already gives you 20 rage per second with the debuff so you can already execute on every GCD.
---
Even mana burning there is nothing the priest can do 1v1 to prevent a sheep reset and the mage drinking back his mana.  Important to note that mana burn doesn't scale with gear.  
---
Also it is a super slow spell, if the mage is at range he can step out of it, and if the mage casts back in your face he will just out damage you.  If you are heal specced maybe you have enough +healing/talent that you can recover, but as shadow you would struggle to get back up in HP once you are knocked into a HP deficit.  
---
Disc priest with imp mana burn will burn mages, but that is more about using it as a damage ability that isn't smite while mindblast is on CD so you don't expose your holy tree to CS when not otherwise needed.
---
Just saying "Alliance Flight Paths" instead of "SOUTH SHORE = DEATH&amp;DISMAY X DO NOT ENTER" is a little misleading.
---
Ok, if you're going to AoE, you're best off doing it while completing green quests. If you want to go after Yellow/Orange quests, either you'll want to team up with another mage, or go with Imp Frostbolt, and work your way towards Imp Chill as soon as you can. Then once you have enough points in Frost, get the 15% mana cost reduction for frost spells, and Imp CoC. Forget all of the fire spells - don't even buy them, except for Fireblast, only to be used for WPvP, because it uses too much mana.  
---
Once you have Imp CoC, you can double back and get Imp Blizz if you want to focus on AoE, but I personally think single-target frostbolts/CoC is more mana efficient, and enables you to fight back if picked on in WPvP a LOT easier than if you are AoE farming. For some reason, soooooo many classes cannot resist ganking a mage in combat. It's like they salivate over the thought.

This has to be a new meme

Check the comments. Plenty of people from vanilla patches and BC saying they found the recipe as a world drop:

This one?
---
I loved cata and mop arena. Besides that they were shit expansions.
---
Weapons was a big part of this, currently weapons are just fancy stat sticks. Getting a blue 2h upgrade over an old green was huge, you really felt the swings and impact of this upgrade.
---
Smites mighty hammer from the Westfall militia claymore was like ascending to another plane.
---
So none in this entire thread and post
---
I heard it made the boss easier. No idea if it did anything though XD
---
I have these in my bookshelf lol. I have a shelf dedicated just to my world of warcraft book collection
---
...but they ARE mostly frostbolts in MC/BWL raids, due to mana conservation. You can do a lot more damage over time if you use frostbolts, instead of chugging mana pots/gems, then wanding when you're oom every other minute because all your mana regen abilities are on CD.  
---
During a DPS race, sure, go nuts. But if it's a fight that lasts more than 10 minutes, calm down, pace yourself, and plan your mana burn for when you can afford it.
---
U can always out deny sexy times if your giving that gudgud
---
sharding is only for starting zones for launch weeks. were fine
---
Username checks out.
---
I feel like most of the people who will be playing aren't connected through reddit/forums and are people that casually play retail that will casually try classic. How many of those players stay is another question, though.
---
One for warr or paladin?
---
Hehe, I loved destroying fire mages DPS rankings as an Arcane mage in WoTLK. Our battlegroups top firemage (and streamer) was absolutely embarassed when his guild started making fun of him because he couldn't keep up. Started making excuses and claiming he was having an off-day, wasn't using pots/flasks, etc., so finally I posted a screenshot where I had him targetted, clearly using a flask, and by chance, his character was doing the potion-use animation... they griefed him so hard after that, he quit the raid right before we got to LK (heroic run, too). Which was fine, because we finished him with 23 players, and I got the sword!
---
An example of the rotation on lucifron is precast flamestrike on pull on posistion tank is pulling it to, pop AP + toep or zg trinket and then spam coc and ae, and flamestrike dot fades cast pom and instant cast flamestrike to reapply it. While doing all this you need to keep oil of immmolation up and cast 1 goblin sapper charge during fight. This rotation is somewhat similar for ghen domo and sulf too in MC once the content is on farm.
---
The difference between playing a Troll and Orc warrior DPS-wise is very minimal. We're talking 1% difference, so I wouldn't worry about the DPS loss. 
---
Aren't Hunters literally just auto-aim bots in Raids? That's not something I'd consider interesting. 
---
I can't speak for the other classes.
---
I bought the game, made a night elf, got to like level 9.  Friend messaged me on MSN, was like, "yo I heard you got wow, come play on my server" and I was like, "but I've made so much progress already, I don't wanna!"  Thankfully he was able to convince me.
---
I also made it to level 18 without knowing how to speak in channels, finally buddy was close enough to hear me /say a WTS ad and after a good laugh corrected me.
---
I was married when vanilla came out.  At this point in my marriage there's no sex left for my wife to withhold if I don't farm for her.
---
The big blank spots always feel so mysterious to me, I wish blizz had something there
---
I plan on making many twins across all brackets. Would you recommend having two accounts where I can run myself through dungeons?
---
You should say where you are from
---
This is probably going to get shit on in this subreddit but really Legion and MoP while they had issues and aren't part of the traditional MMO style we love (like Classic is) were pretty great in some respects. Sure, Pandas weren't a great theme but the actual way classes felt in MoP were great, most raids were pretty enjoyable and PVP was pretty fun and speaking to high-rated pvpers they seemed to enjoy it as well. Legion likewise had some great cosemetic rewards and while everyone having ashbringer was weird, the artifacts did add a really unique element of gameplay. Much more I could say about those two in specific, don't get me wrong I love classic but I don't think its fair to say people who liked those expansions wouldn't like classic.
---
That guy is a legend! Also love his other videos!
---
If you see any sleeping peons, smack their asses with a club.
---
Hunters' strength can't be measured in pure DPS because they have great utility when it comes to kiting, trapping, FD, etc
---
OK very cool thanks
---
Ah ok I see what you mean, thanks
---
Nothing I can add at the moment but I wanted to say thank you for making this.  This is the kind of shit I can really sink hours upon hours in to collecting.
---
Why be in the garage when you can kick her out
---
Getting Whirlwind Axe as Warrior felt like you were actually rewarded for that huge quest line and made you OP as fuck. God I miss class quests.
---
That is very true - I wasn't so much thinking about their strength, more so about their playstyle in Raids.
---
They do offer great ultilty, but you'll still be auto-shooting a lot of the time.

Dang, the pserver crowd goes out of their way to downvote anyone who bashes 'em. O.O
---
https://pvp.henhou.se/ It's only a PVP server but everyone has equal gear unlike retro wow so you can actually win duels as a fresh player.
---
Hunters shit on rogues in pvp
---
I played Retro for a bit but then I found out about https://pvp.henhou.se/. It's better than retro because everyone has equal gear.
---
My hype was too much so I started playing on a pserver now my hype has subsided
---
Haha yep.  Praying the orc racial works basically
---
Honestly, you should just played whatever you have fun playing the most. It would be so unfortunate if you invest so much time into a character you won't get the most fun out of.
---
Every class is viable late game, you just need to demonstrate you are a good guildmate and that you know the content, you can commit to a schedule, and you can farm up stuff needed for raids. If you do demonstrate you're a good guildmate, I can't think of rational guildmasters who wouldn't take you because it's hard to find 40 dedicated and competent people for a raid. 
---
Worst comes to worst, level another character to 60. It'll be much easier to do so once you have a 60 hunter because you can do all sorts of things to help speed level your second character. Enjoy your time in Classic :)
---
So it seemed very interesting when trying to maximize dps aswell, I think kargoz had a video about it. I forget the specifics though since it was a while ago
---
God dammit Dave
---
This is such a blast of nostalgia. I remember 12 year old me watching his video in awe hoping to one day become that powerful.
---
Really? I had no idea. I thought rogues were kind of the end all be all of pvp
---
YESSSSSSSSS OMFG LOL! This is vanilla history and belongs in the classic WoW museum along with Leroy Jenkins!
---
Why are you on this sub lol
---
Could be.  I can't remember everything from 14 years ago.  It still required the rep to use it.

noone cares for your le memes, pathetic

UPS full time HR supervisor here as well! The dread of peak coming so quickly after the game launches makes me sad.
---
I used to really like scaling , not just in wow but just in general. But then I watched some of those really long kevin jordan streams where he plays wow and talks about modern wow vs classic wow and he really changed my mind on the whole concept. Now I dont like it any more
---
Your mistake is ruining the guy's first time instead of letting him figure it out and explore.
---
zug zug
---
Not sure what you are saying, tbh.
---
I was sitting here wondering the same thing! I have the title but only pvpd when my friends draggee me so I could get them to go do a ddungeon in exchange.
---
Yeah that's the heirloom mount so 100% retail. Not even a pserver.
---
Me too i used to get power leveled a lot but I dont really remember it fondly. i just had no clue what else to do (wow was my first MMO and the whole concept of questing or even grinding was freign to me).
---
But your comment made me wonder how that would work now , if lets say you take a lvl 20 into stockades with a max lvl char would every mob be 60 ? would the max player see them as 60 and the 20 see them as 20? little weird
---
While there are alot of cucks about, realistically this is a dumb ideology.
---
An easy way to remember it is just to think of it this way : zones scale up but not down. So a lvl 20 cant go to plaguelands but a lvl 55 can go to westfall
---
You are playing the heart and soul of Warcraft.
---
I agree
---
Short, easy to follow, with good info. Great video!
---
Better to wait until they chain deathcoil with fear - THEN iceblock. Also, if you have shadow reflector, use your counterspell first, wait for that to come off cooldown, then use your shadow reflector, then use your iceblock after that. That way, counterspell should be back off CD, you can throw up a flameward/decurse, and pick your moment for a frost nova/counterspell/shatter combo...

Well with the retail talent system the powerspike is actually much higher when you get one, but I do prefer the feeling of improving my character every lvl no matter how small.

There was a [compilation post](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b5mh0e/wow_classic_class_guides_resources/) on the sub a little while ago. I don't personally know how good the info is, but some of the links are text posts and might be what you're looking for.

First ever zone I started in when I played Vanilla WoW, and I still remember the path of zones I took while leveling my Tauren. I pretty much started when Burning Crusade first came out, my uncle introduced me to the game and assumed I would have played a Night Elf, Human, or something 'cute' like a Gnome because I'm a girl.
---
???? Since when did they make a blue post that was solely about progressive itemisation? For me a quote of them saying that every item is confirmed to be in its 1.12 state
---
This was in TBC. I hope this is possible in pure vanilla but I can't be sure.
---
Stormwind Harbor was the start of WOTLK
---
Virginia here, I wanted to main a paladin at first, but I've been leveling one for the last week or so on a pserver and it sucks balls. When classic comes out, I think I'll main a dwarf hunter. I'm a wrath baby, so I've never played vanilla when it was out, but I'm hyped as shit all the same. If you wanna team up, I'd be able to get on most nights between 5-10pm. I work nights, so I sleep during the day. But on my days off I'll be playing all day and night.
---
Shit I paid like 7 dollars for mine online.
---
Just stringing us along with some juicy suspense!
---
In general I just can't wait to get familiar with the common bozos on the server I'll end up playing on.
---
I’m buying my wife an all expense paid trip to the next state over. She’s taking the kid for the 4-5 days to visit family while I take my vaca
---
Fear Ward dworf priest. Everything else is okay what you like. Human/orcs get weapon specialization which is supposed to be amazing for melee dps, but we don't know exactly by how much since private servers might have it wrong.
---
I can’t wait until I’m roaming free in Azeroth on my Paladin on a comfy PvE server. Afk in the middle of nowhere (not near mobs ofc!) and know I won’t be killed. After years of playing PvP pservers, this’ll be heaven. 
---
Please give us a release date! 😫
---
🤔
---
They can improve on the next expansion all they want but they aren't willing to fix the core issues (for classic players). Which is phasing and LFG/LFR tool. I just don't see them ever getting rid of phasing therefore the servers will never feel like communities.
---
What's wrong with you. Dwarf is master race for every class
---
The lack of salvation (30% threat reduction) is hard for locks because you output a ton of threat and have 0 reduction abilities. Horde has 20% but its rare for warlocks to get since melee get WF first.
---
Yeah but the problem is they can't use "For the King" to represent the alliance because the alliance isn't a single unified group like the Horde is. For the King is solely about one faction's ruler and not all-inclusive. If anything the horde should use "For the Warchief" and allies should use "For the Alliance." To flip-flop it would make more sense imo.
---
"Along the way, we’ve taken a close look at items that provide the biggest power gains, many of which were introduced in 1.10 as part of a sweeping dungeon itemization pass. That patch was when Tier 0.5 gear was introduced, and Relics were added to the drop tables of many bosses. It also adjusted drop rates and drop locations of a lot of gear (to make room for the Relics). We’ve gone back and reconstructed many of the most heavily affected drop tables as they existed prior to the 1.10 patch, and we’re planning to update the drop tables alongside the Ahn’Qiraj War Effort. Prior to the Ahn’Qiraj unlock, most of the drop rates and locations will look as they did in the patches prior to 1.10, with exceptions—there are lots of little changes made in earlier patches that don’t have a big effect on player power, and in those cases, we’re planning to use the 1.12 drop rates and locations.
---
One example of the many items we’re planning for is: Titanic Leggings, which is a world drop that first appeared in 1.10. We can confirm that it will be controlled by the same content unlock that restricts the other 1.10 loot changes."
---
That post mixed with various other conversations about how the only data they have is 1.12. Therefore items and drop takes will be gated based on patches but actual itemization will not.
---
On top of the most recent beta leak screenshots.
---
The mobs are 20 and 60.  If you think about dps in terms of hp% removed per second, that's how it can balance.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTO_zNnzSs0
---
I did the opposite as a Tauren hunter going to dun morogh to take rare white bear.
---
In the Blizzard post updating the phases from 4 to 6 it states that with tier 0.5 gear will have drop rate and location changes. This ‘loot revamp’ can also be found on the outdated Wowhead phase list.
---
Good examples. Though I was thinking more along the lines of indirect effects. Maybe another example could be horde warlocks being better in PvP because UD have wotf.

Yup, my girl is actually happy about it. A week were I barley bother her besides snu snu and asking for food or cuddles.
---
Plus she loves seeing me enjoy my hobbies, totally cool with me having a raiding schedule and taking the time off work etc. She said she wants to try it out so I'm def gonna make an alt with her when she gets the urge. Sorry though on launch she ain't gonna hold me back !!
---
when have they ever clearly said that every single item will be in 1.12 state
---
19-29 brackets are nothing but Rogue/hunter fests where 70% or more of the BG class composition is made up of those two. At 39-49 you get diversity or more interesting skill sets to use. 39 is more popular than 49 however so I think the 39 bracket is the most diverse and therefore best of the options.
---
think of it more as recreating the game how it was (what they are trying to do)
---
Yeah that's what I did
---
Wotf is over rated, pvp is so good for horde because orc stun resist. Pve is op for alliance cause salvation buff let's dps pump out more dps.yet both sides do all content without a problem.
---
I hope, even if it's unrealistic, that they'll learn from classic and make an expansion without LFG/LFR, phasing, cross server stuff, and more like vanilla.
---
You’re reading way too much into this. Its assumed by the wording in the title that he meant “they did this back in vanilla and its still active”.
---
Or just have a significant other who knows what is important to you and values your own autonomy:)
---
In Blizzards post updating the content plan from 4 phases to 6 it is stated that when tier 0.5 comes out, certain dungeon loot will have drop rate and drop locations. Which is why I listed it ‘loot revamp’ not ‘progressive itemization’

So salv would be even better on classes with less threat mitigation. Wouldnt that mean warriors would be better relative to rogue on ally side than horde side?
---
Simply having an mmo that is challenging yet enjoyable at the same time. It’ll take me 8 months to get maxed probably lol
---
Which guide should I buy for classic? I’m a fairly new player.
---
Or just get married to someone who is cool with your lifestyle. No reason to keep someone around who controls your life. I feel so bad for anyone here who has to seriously bargain for time playing wow.
---
Red == Dead
---
Most of what I've seen on YT videos of the GM tools in action on pservers are accurate for the most part. GMs had the ability to do damn near anything.
---
One GM restored a character's gear after the account was hacked and accidentally gave the player an item that insta-killed every enemy in X radius.
---
Like idiots that toon and their guilt went and got several world firsts that night.
---
The private server GM stuff is pretty accurate.
---
I played on a private classic server a couple of years ago for about 6 months after getting laid off from work and a nice severance package.  I would do shit around the house like cleaning, yard work and grocery shopping but otherwise my days were WoW, often 12 or more hours a day.  My wife would even make me dinner and bring it to me in our office on raid nights. Even with the extremely optimal set up for no-life gaming, I still felt like I didn't have enough time to do everything I wanted to do in the game.  
---
That's the story that I tell everyone that doesn't really get what classic is and want to get into it and raid.  It's not a game, it's not a job, it's a fucking life.  Its glorious, but damn, you have to have your life ready for such a thing.
---
I'll probably skip classic entirely, unfortunately. I know myself and I know classic. I have a daughter now that will be ~18 months old when this thing drops.  Classic is a drug and I'm not running the risk of getting addicted again.
---
But damn you guys are in for a good time.
---
Almost every class is hindered by threat cap on both sides. It just so happens that alliance has less problems with it. Warriors don't have WF on alliance which is a huge boost in dmg but at the same time can be unpredictable, and if you are riding the threat cap and over hit with wf can kill you. If you look at logs though both factions have high dps parses due to the fights being so short.
---
I remember 39 locks being absolutely insane w/ SL.
---
yea that is the blue post i thought u would reference. but no where in that post do they specifically say they wont do it. its unlikely to happen but its still a possibility... given that if they dont do it, lots of content will become obsolete for getting BIS.
---
I have very complicated feelings on level scaling. When I first played with it after it launched, I was incredibly pleased with it. I could finally finish zones and see all the content in them without overleveling everything, and it allowed much more freedom in how you choose to level. Wanna skip Outland and go straight to Northrend? Or just spend 60-80 doing Outland exclusively? You can do that now.
---
Moreover, it actually made certain parts of the leveling experience difficult once more. I distinctly remember countless people decrying Draenor as being too difficult when the change happened, but you have no idea how happy I was to actually have to struggle to level in WoW again, even if it was only for certain zones later in the leveling process. For me, it single-handedly breathed life back into the leveling experience after having it stagnate since MoP. 
---
Yet, I do think something was lost in that transition. One of my most fond memories from Vanilla was looking across the river from Elywnn to Duskwood and seeing a Skull-level mob for the first time. It was only one wolf, prowling on the other side of the river, but it intimidated the hell out of me. It was a real "Oh shit" moment, where I realized that the mobs I'd been plucking away at for the past 10 or so levels weren't anything compared to what was waiting just on the other side of the river. 
---
I think level scaling diminishes that feeling a strong bit. Now, many players will be able to look across the river to see a scaled-down wolf, and just think, "Huh, guess I'll explore that when I'm done here."
---
On the whole, I think level-scaling really works for Retail, but I'd be lying if I said I couldn't appreciate the old way of doing things.
---
But since rogues has more tools to reduce threat...wouldnt it make sense that they benefit less the less threat matters?
---
If your wife doesnt already play wow and knows whats going on, the best advice i can give you is honestly stfu and follow her around. Only help if she asks for it. Every now and then guide her to do something (like travelling the damned world for rfc and wc quests) so you can do a dungeon with her. But dont force her to optimize shit. The game was made to be approachable by anyone, she will figure it out. Min/maxing isnt needed and that kind of attitude will make her hate the game because she will just be following you instead of just exploring.
---
Rogues have lower dmg cap than warriors late end game and end up doing less. They don't have problem with threat but don't scale as well as warriors with gear. So they end up doing less damage
---
Everyone is going to play Classic. Some may not stay but everyone will give it a try.
---
Dont be the type of person to take someone else's name / story... who does that?
---
But that's exactly my point. The less the warriors have to worry about threat, the further ahead of the rogues they can be.
---
Every time you stop on the Golshire Inn square you get bamboozled by a saucy dwarven lass.
---
iirc, if a pally beats a warlock, then the warlock is either undergeared or bad.
---
It will definitely impact the feel of the starter zones.
---
I don't think anyone will get to experience how launch was back in 2004 to see how many people there were. It was something else.
---
You were more drawn into the game seeing there's hundreds of other players around experiencing the same thing you were - you were less concerned with tagging mobs for quests due to the sheer awe of it all.
---
With sharding that will be missed. Will it ruin the game? No. But it is a missed experience and a good one, crashes or queues be damned.
---
It used to be redpilled
---
Theoritcally yeah, but data doesn't show this since alot of dmg and high parses can end up due to English. You have equal amounts of factions/classes parsing high. Overall alliance is good for dps warriors but they can't really go 2h like horde can with WF. There's pros and cons to both sides.
---
I agree with you crashes and ques be damned
---
iirc, until ZG came out, it was nearly impossible to keep up with casters gear-wise as a warrior. But maybe that was just my experience.
---
Also the LFG button. 
---
Kill OP with prejudice
---
A stated plan!
---
You want the Bradygames Master Guide, Second Edition. As well as the Bradygames Dungeon Companion.   
---
I got all my copies for like, 3 buck each in 2015 but I imagine their price is much higher now with classic looming. Good luck friends!
---
snowdonia park
---
Doing dungeon groups and meeting new people, also the occasional PvP back and forth while leveling.
---
You're right.  I must persevere and continue to hit the crack pipe until the fat lady sings.
---
Fresh rollout each 2 years? Rofl
---
kek came in tbc &gt;:(
---
10/10
---
Ele but neither are ideal.
---
Yeah, the thing about finding a dedicated leveling partner is that the way to Best Ensure you both reach maximum level together is by setting regular play times. Certain days of the week, times a day, do that s*** clinical
---
Im the exact opposite:  any great leveling areas you can recommend?  You can be vague (I like surprises).  I'm going more for fun/aesthetics/world pvp action and less for efficiency.
---
Man your addon is clean
---
You continue by not asking other people what to do in order to preserve your mental health, you do what you already know you should do to preserve your mental health and enjoyment of the game in the future
---
Going back home.... I’ve been wishing for this to happen again and just simply wanting to go back in time to the glory days for so long I’m just ready to go back to the best MMO I’ve ever been a part of
---
I did join WoW because of the cinematic of the dwarf hunter and thought "That's so cool I can have a pet fight beside me" which led to me leveling a hunter. I dont know what got into me. My mind has become corrupted. Save me!
---
Nice one :D
---
Yeah I also made maps but usually not multiplayer maps but single player ones. I didn't have internet yet (that changed when Starcraft came out), so I made 1vX maps against the computer.
---
Welp, there ya go. Next question?
---
I’d hit you up but I’m going horde so best of luck on the battlefield my man
---
No I was teasing you mate
---
I remember in vanilla I got bored of blacksmithing and just stopped.  Got to 60 with like 140ish skill.  I did finishing mining though as that was way less effort.
---
Hunter has one of the more interesting raiding rotations because you have to time your abilities to not reset your auto attack. You have to pay attention much more than mage or warlock.
---
tmw the king in vanilla is the same one as the king in battle for azeroth
---
It’s true. But probably spelling, hah.
---
And I got downvoted for suggesting it was alpha. Progress is progress. See you in the summer.
---
You know it. I am glad classic will let the wraith babies move into big boy pants. Going to be fun to see what they are made of
---
Twisted chanter's staff remains in my heart as well.
---
So what you're saying is the alliance "battle cry" is shit tier garbage, just like their faction, and they have no choice in the matter?
---
Got'cha.
---
I think there will be heaps of fresh players.
---
The difference with classic and retail for new players is getting in at the start vs getting in something that's been running for 15 years with an overwhelming amount of updates and players that are already geared out the wazoo.
---
World of Warcraft is extremely well known, so getting to start at the beginning is going to attract heaps of new players. I wouldn't be surprised if nearly all the new players started there, and then moved to retail later when they want more.
---
Meeting Stones were TBC expansion sadly. 
---
I wish they were vanilla.

Dear friend. If the truth were obvious to everyone, life wouldn't be what it was.  
---
Be happy that you were the correct minority.
---
Undead Female have the best cast animation on the horde imo.
---
Boner kill
---
If he doesn't wanna heal in raids he should really consider if shaman is the right class. He's gonna have such a hard time getting accepted into groups.
---
["soon"](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/010/692/19789999.jpg)
---
Horse shit
---
wouldn't maximum rage executes be better though? Do 1.3 attack speed weapons produce more rage?
---
Kill me.
---
Would be cool for them to go back to their roots which made them great
---
This isn't a model ID change, this is a spell that applies an aura with the effect of transforming the player into the display ID of a chicken.
---
Also, if Blizzard wanted they could remove this aura from his easily by querying whatever aura DB they probably have for this spell's ID which is 3246 which I found in my own dbc files.
---
The blue post we wanted but not the one we deserved.
---
This is some next level meditative stuff.
---
Damn this sub for reinforcing my checking so late! Pavlovianly conditioning me to be here refreshing at midnight on a Friday.
---
I clicked to move the first 20 levels in vanilla after coming from Diablo 2.
---
Soon™
---
Wowwwww!
---
It's gonna be hard to get anything by that sounds like dick through without risk of being flagged later.  Even in cases where the word is close, sounds like a banned word, or even a slang word found on Urban dictionary, If it violated the ToS it was subject to be changed.
---
Summer. Texas. Garage. Lol....
---
oh no...
---
I never got it, I was a broke joke
---
Wasn’t there the neutral questing area in northwest swamp of sorrows? the Harborage? May have been added later but iirc it was there in vanilla
---
Me too...
---
My girlfriend was a bigger WoW nerd than I was, and I played a melee hunter back in Vanilla. Can make sexy times more interesting.
---
Okayyyyy...,,
---
If you think I'm gonna take it easy on you just because we met on reddit you got another thing comin' buddy.
---
Very rarely.  The main reason would be to take someone out of the world cause they were causing trouble, but you still needed to speak with them.  It was more likely if you violated a policy and were gonna take a time out we would have just had the normal suspension out of game.

&gt; Hey folks! I’ve got a small update here to help quell some of the rumors and let you know where we are at for WoW Classic. We recently began a phase of internal employee alpha testing. The new build data that many of you have been discussing over the last few days is simply part of this process. Phases like this allow us to test out the game content along with other functionality that will be used in the live game, like logging in through the Blizzard Battle.net App.
---
&gt; Aside from that, we don’t have any announcements to make at this time. I know all of you are very excited about this game and we thank you for your patience as we continue to develop it. More information will be coming soon!
---
For those who can't see the picture.
---
One of the unused zones. They just scrunched the continent down and made it mountains in Cataclysm.
---
Can an admin pin this?
---
Let's add the biggest thing on here... there was no quest addon, there was no fountain of information on the internet , as far as I'm aware the public beta didn't include all levels ( very possibly wrong ) . They did it with very little information, to say that we have only halved the time since with such fine tuning is actually not that impressive.
---
It's weird, rogues got some op abilities in the 30-39 bracket but they were never any good there.
---
Makes sense. Compared to each successive expansion vanilla was incredibly simple, plus they have unprecedented access to internal bug Checkers and past performance of classic which pretty much renders a beta phase irrelevant.
---
We're going to get it early summer for sure
---
Our guild is going to allow him to raid as a non healing shaman but he’s the only person getting his special treatment. At the end of the day I want him to play the class he enjoys which is shaman and he’s a DPS type player not a healer. I know it’s a weird situation but yeah it is what it is 🤷‍♂️
---
Hear, hear. This is the worst stretch of the wait...it's close, but still far enough away that I can't be patient.
---
Why you gotta hurt me like this?
---
"No beta/alpha confirmed" isn't *exactly* true. They may do one in the future. I think it's safe to assume there will not be a playable beta (closed or open) any time soon, though.
---
"beta confirmed" people on suicide watch
---
I need the strength to pull my bow string back...trust me.
---
\^\^
---
It was mostly people disappointed they won't get to melt their hands on the beta and enjoy playtime sooner. It's a secret blessing because they'll be less burned out this way haha
---
In my opinion dynamic respawn is probably the worst change blizzard can make to the game it affects the gameplay to much.
---
Everything that I loved about World of Warcraft has been stripped away over the years. We get our game back.
---
The reddit title seems a little misleading - It make it sound like they are doing internal testing in place of doing an Alpha/Beta. This blue post doesn't actually clarify that - it only says that what was pushed to CDN's was for internal testing. So, we could still have to go through a beta phase, or possibly they won't have one and will go straight to release even sooner.
---
Yeah saw that coming. But still a bit of a bummer.
---
Wait are you saying plainsrunning was removed in 1.10? It never made it into launch
---
He's not really a DPS type player. Those like competing on damage meters, contributing to the raid and min/maxing their class. If he wants to raid a dps shaman clearly he doesn't care about any of that, he just hates healing.
---
I hope we get some sort of beta to test addons and sort out UI stuff though.
---
Ive been saying it since the beggining, no need to beta a game from 2006. All the bugs have been fixed over 15 years of development. They can manually check for themselves all the new bugs from transferring over to the modern client without the community
---
No. Kill me.
---
He won’t care about topping charts in raids. He just wants to play a DPS shaman. Is there nothing an Ele shaman can do to benefit the raid at all? Absolutely nothing?
---
Also no FP to STV except through Booty Bay, which is why horde are so predominant in that zone, and quicker to respond with max lvl players.  
---
This was sort-of fixed by adding a flight master at the small alliance camp at the very north end of the map, but wasn't enough, IMO. There should've been something more for alliance in that zone.
---
They have been doing an awful job at marketing classic. So many players don’t even realize it’s coming out.
---
Hopefully they start marketing when the release date is announced.
---
Not into twinking myself but looking forward to some video highlights.
---
What? The blue post is basically "Everyone calm down we're just doing an internal employee alpha atm"
---
Where does it confirm no beta? If anything it suggests a beta annoucement may be coming in the future.
---
If it’s early summer, why the hell haven’t they given a release date then?
---
Ah, I see you are a man of culture as well.
---
Thanks man.
---
Based on what I've seen, I think the Classic population is going to be dramatically smaller than we'd like to think. It seems like there are a lot of current retail players that don't really care about classic, and it's definitely not making big enough waves for the gaming scene as a whole to take notice since everyone is just obsessed with Battle Royale games and new stuff. Even the people that used to be really into WoW growing up had no idea that Classic was a thing. There's good reactions to it, and people willing to go back to it, but I really think this gem that we treasure so dearly is in a somewhat niche market at the moment.
---
With that being said, I'd love to be wrong, and see the gaming community express a lot of enthusiasm and willingness to play it.
---
Aoe farmed silithus cultist camps for a week or 2. I sold the rune cloth and whatever else they dropped. I did this for 2 lvl 60’s before BC.
---
Wow I want to hang myself
---
The STV zeppelin made any Alliance advantage in AV pale in comparison
---
No, what you want is to be able to execute on every single global cooldown, you never want to pool rage when executing. Sure, big numbers are cool but when it comes to effective dps, smash that button as fast as you possibly can.  
---
With that said, the amount of rage generated would be about the same with fast weapons as with slow, as long as they have similar DPS. The difference would be that slower weapons hit for bigger numbers, producing more rage, but by that measure also pools it, so it might go from 5 &gt; 60 &gt; execute(0) &gt; missed GCD(no swings cause slow weapons) &gt; hits(40) &gt; Execute &gt; 13 (oh hit)(no execute, missed GCD) &gt; 50 (execute) &gt; 0.  
---
Fast weapons might go &gt; 5 &gt; 30(execute) &gt; 20 (execute) &gt; 15(execute) &gt; 40 (execute) and therefore missing less GCD's and doing more DPS during execute phase. Execute is most damage per rage if you can do it on every single GCD.  
---
Might be messy but see where im going? Vael is a different beast tho and should definitely be theorycrafted to be sure what's best for that particular bossfight, but otherwise what i wrote above is
---

Anyone know where Tips is? I don't want him to do something stupid....before I can corpse camp him!
---
The last word in this blue post is starting to get painful
---
Because they aren't anticipating it being as large a launch as, say, a new expansion.
---
Lol they're not that bad, they're just not good. I just don't understand the mindset - *I'm going to commit to playing hours on a schedule every week with 39 other players to achieve things, and purposely play in a way that I contribute very little and everyone has to carry me*
---
So they will just release it out of the blue ?
---
That's not vanilla.
---
Probably not, They will announce when they're ready to announce

Downvoted for the shitty title! 
---
I'm glad they spoke out about this though.
---
Talk about a latenight update.  They can't possibly be at the office, so its interesting to see them post official news like this so late.
---
world enlarger first
---
I originally played Guild Wars and was obsessed with it, then moved over to WoW. My obsession with GW was tiny compared to WoW.
---
I've found through testing on a very popular private server that the hakkari MH with dal'rend OH gave me about the same DPS in raids as full dal'rend set. While it has its uses and is not totally worthless, although its not ideal, it should definitely be hunter prio cause of the +1%crit and 28AP, leaving more weapons to melee's that are far better for them.
---
You wanna join too? We'd love to have you!
---
I agree with this. Plus, I'd say $15/month commitment is something that the next generation of gamers is probably not very down for when you compare it to free Fortnite. I think it won't reach the top on Twitch (not that I care much about Twitch anyway) since there are already streamers that are pulling massive views playing the big games. Hell, Apex blew up when it dropped and it's already fallen back a lot.
---
This hurts the July 16th date.
---
Isn't exactly true? Lolz it's not even remotely true. Beta isn't live now is confirmed, but we already knew that. Beta is still very likely to happen within the next 4 weeks. An external and publicly accessible testing build is a very obvious step towards a beta.
---
All the links should be correct now. I'm double checking everything and marking stuff in green I've confirmed.
---
Seriously reminds me how much easier it is to play horde than alliance. All the cities/camps in close proximity to so many raids/instances, strategically placed so well for each leveling zone - it's basically pre-built for you to simply wander into the next leveling zone, with easy-to-finish questlines all ready for you to smash your way through to 60... unless you can't find Mankirk's wife, that is...
---

---
It's pretty usual for companies to do alpha testing internally or via friends and family. This post (as far as I can tell) does not negate the fact a beta may imminent. Stand down, folks.
---
I was very surprised that we'd be getting a beta considering how little time there is before summer
---
 I
---
No. No. Kill me, pal
---
Yeah when you only say """""""my man""""""" i'm supposed to know the exact meaning even though it can mean:
---
"My man, really?"
---
Or
---
"My man, i'm proud of you"
---
And i picked the most common meaning, sorry i couldn't read your mind. I'll make sure to read your mind next time because telepathy is possible.
---
Just watched the videos on YouTube about the beta leaks. The YouTuber in question was so hyped that he kept saying he was going to cry in the beginning of the clip. 
---
Hope they finish internal testing quickly and get this puppy out onto live! So many folks are eager for the launch..
---
I get what you’re saying. But at the end of the day what’s most important is that he plays the class and spec he wants and is going to enjoy the most. He likes to pvp a lot and do heavy damage. You can’t do that as a resto shaman.
---
good human
---
I honestly hope they release it as soon as possible, even if it does have some minor bugs. It is really important to get this game out during the summer to capture a new generation of WoW players (college students and younger) who weren't old enough to experience classic WoW 12+ years ago. And summer is of course when most of them have the most time to fully immerse themselves in WoW. I really hope a younger generation can experience the awe and wonder of Classic WoW and know that they have seemingly all the time in the world to play this 12 hours a day for weeks on end.
---
Plz give AOE loot.
---
Does this sub genuinely ever get tired of repeating the same shit everyday? I don't like retail but, it's getting old seeing nothing but, "Classic will kill Retail" reposts non fucking stop. Why? Do you just want free karma? Do you want to insult retail players/ What reason do you have to keep posting the same retail death memes over and over again?
---
So long as he remembers to drop totems, he'll be contributing. Trouble is that he'd contribute more by dropping totems *and* tossing out Chain heals.
---
I had a 39 druid; it was pretty fun but it seems like I respecced every week 'wow this sucks without swiftmend' 'wow this sucks without improved shred' 'wow this sucks without omen'
---
They're basically combining rendering, networking, profile, database, assets, client systems from 4 different games developed over the last two decades into a brand new game. If you think that won't require testing I'm really curious about how you think software dev works and what you base that assumption on.
---
yep I had one, pretty good in classic, completely dominant in tbc
---
When people say Classic will kill retail i get a hearty chuckle. What's going to happen (i guarantee it) is that Classic WoW for the first month is going to skyrocket. Possibly higher numbers that retail gets atm. and Retail's numbers are going to plummet. Then the next month Blizzard will see a surge in BFA purchases, and higher retail subscriptions. After a few months it will flatten out where retail will have about the same number of players it had before Classic's release and Classic will have like 1/4 of the players of retail. 
---
Then after about 1-2 years retail will be chugging along with its latest expansion and Classic is going to die. Players are much better at the game now than they were back in the day, and power leveling is much more sophisticated. People are going to consume all off the classic content and then go back to Retail. Because they have 1-2 expansions worth of content they can use before all the classic players start bitching. Classic, TBC, and possibly WoTLK (but like half the classic community doesnt like Wrath at all.) So the question lies in what happens when people complete everything classic has to offer. 
---
Does Classic after 1-2 years still have the playerbase to be worth supporting? and if they do support it, what do they do? do they wipe all progress and fuck over anyone who wasn't finished with everything? or do they rework content from further expansions to operate on a vanilla platform, eventually ending with BFA, but with classic mechanics? or does it just die
---
(and just so you guys know. Many of the top end players in classic are going to be hitting 60 within 7 days. They are going to finish everything that blizzard releases within days.)
---
Would it be worth it for him to still chain heal some during some parts of certain boss fights or is chain heal just not even worth it without being properly specced?
---
...this is essentially why I quit paying/playing
---
I would love a release date so I can plan my vacation from work accordingly.  That would be nice.

It's releasing in summer not before summer, and summer is 3 months.
---
Thanks, honestly I think this is the best approach
---
I was a shaman too back in the day. 
---
Aslong as he goes in with the knowledge that he has chosen a support class and that he'll never be seen on the damage meter in a raid environment. Gearing wise he will be wearing alot of cloth gear because the itemization for ele shaman almost doesn't exist untill AQ comes out.
---
I guess what I am really trying to say is that if you want to have your friend playing after level 60 then going ele shaman doesn't provide the greatest odds.

Wow. I don't know if this is brilliance or insanity.

It may be a necessary evil, but I think it's immersion breaking and will ruin the feel of overall community. I'll continue to be concerned about it until they give us more specific details.
---
Lets be honest, some of us just don't like being assholes is what it comes down to
---
Misleading title. They didn't even mention a public Beta/Alpha at all. They're simply quelling rumours and hype that they plan to release a public test period in the near future. We could receive a public beta, but for the moment nothing is concrete. They're basically saying "We are not at the point where a public beta makes sense, don't expect one to crop up tomorrow."
---
Sup guuuyyyys
---
Not too surprising. I’m hoping it won’t last too long before we’re good to go.
---
You really think they would give us an announcement like this if they were planning to do a beta in the near future? Hell no! When does summer start? Very soon. Do we have a release date yet about if its early or late summer? Nope, why? Probably because we are going to get a release date soon skipping the beta because its extremely unnecessary. They have hinted plenty of times "we want you to enjoy a classic summer" "enjoy", im sure they are planning a release date before august, and to make an announcement like this is basically telling us there wont be a beta announced in the near future and is saying if they push a beta next month there will be barely any time to fix anything, they arent going to release the game a week after a beta that comes out may 20th, lmao. Be real.
---
And get rid of flying mounts, too
---
Elemental Plateau became my hunting grounds after I got my epic flying mount. My guild finished Black Temple before any other guild on the server was even attuned for it, so I had an insane gear advantage over the Alliance.
---
This was also when there was the bugged damage of putting separate ranks of Windfury on your one-handers, so I would quite literally one shot people with Stormstrike sometimes
---
Disappointed this wasn't that one post about alt tabbing to watch porn.
---
This was definitely possible in vanilla, I remember getting spedrun through SM many times. Such an efficient way to speed through those levels.
---
Except it's not a game from 2006. If they were releasing the same client as before, I'd agree, but they had the redevelop everything.
---
It's a new game.
---
Lol is this /s ? You skipped frostbite, piercing ice and frost channelling, 3 of the best talents in the tree.
---
This build being an internal alpha doesn't confirm that there won't be a beta. All it confirms is that this build isn't beta, and that if there is one, it won't be in the very near future.
---
 [https://i.redd.it/c63vpruj4utz.jpg](https://i.redd.it/c63vpruj4utz.jpg)  he could play support enhancement shaman with nightfall weapon to support your wizards which is actually viable and not a bad choice, linked a "guide" screen of that ... just google enhancement support vanilla if you want further information
---
See (stickied)[https://nm.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bf8d7q/blue_posted_its_an_employee_alpha/]
---
They didn't mention the word beta once and they wouldn't make an announcement like this if there were to be a beta in the near future like next week or 2 weeks from now. It means either a late beta or no beta at all. And if its a late beta that means late release that might barely even make it into the summer timeframe. Seriously, i really dont think there will be a beta.
---
P
---
V
---
There's a potion too I think
---
It's mostly about the gold.
---
After reading this, I doubt we're going to get a beta; it's just way too close to summer at this point. Praying the release is before August.
---
Completely wrong, they told us how they did this and the process of it. Instead of making such an ignorant statement like this, search it up.
---
He needs to look into totem twisting and pick up a nightfall and play enhance if he wants to be useful.
---
WTF
---
It is not a new game, they did not build a new engine, new source, new code, or any of that. They took modern retail and stripped it of all of its features and had re manually rework the vanilla aspects of it like the talent trees, etc. The quests have always been in the game/database and was easily restored with its up to date and bug fixed era. Bugs can easily be tested by themselves without a community.
---
The title is still untrue and misleading.
---
HELLO BLIZZARD YOU SEEM TO ASSUME THAT I AM NOT AN EMPLOYEE OF YOURS. PLEASE CORRECT THIS MISTAKE IMMEDIATELY BY PROVIDING ME WITH THE ABILITY TO CONNECT TO THIS ALPHA. THE FACT THAT I AM NOT COMMUNICATING WITH YOU THROUGH THE PROPER CHANNELS OF AN EMPLOYEE SHOULD NOT DETER YOU FROM TRUSTING ME AND PROVIDING ME WITH THE PROPER CHANNELS TO ACCESS THE ALPHA.

Oh that makes so much more sense now. Who needs frostbite in pvp when you have 3/3 permafrost and 3/3 imp blizzard! #newmeta

I've heard several people say 29 was a hunter bracket but hunters just got destroyed in 29.
---
Play what you find to be fun
---
Most likely one of the plethora of people buying one month and retrieving old accounts they hadnt used in 13years you currently see on this sub.
---
No. No more Alternate Universe Bullshit. We're going back. Burning Crusade hasn't happened yet and for all we know it fuckin' won't. I'm not much of a gatekeeper but I don't plan on role playing with people who act like this is anything else.
---
Okay but what you think is going to happen does not make it “confirmed”. You’re taking a pretty big leap based on something that wasn’t said.
---
Thanks for the information. I was meaning specifically for the Vael fight though. I don't play warrior but I do like understanding the other class mechanics in Vanilla.
---
All of Blackwing Lair. Just an amazing raid dungeon and my all time favorite.
---
Cannot wait to get back in there.
---
Only way holy nova is good is when you multibox with mages doing arcane explosion...esp in av
---
It's pretty usual for companies to do alpha testing internally or via friends and family. This post (as far as I can tell) does not negate the fact a beta may be imminent. Stand down, folks.
---
My theory...It's likely after testing they may do a weekend load test. That is, a test to certify the integrity of their servers, and a testament to the developers code under high stress. Even though we talk about this as "1.12" code, it's really not. It's 1.12 content refactored for a modern client/server.
---
I'd love to see your codebase that says otherwise.
---
No. No. No. Kill me, buddy.
---
You cant wait to play the most op class in the game? interesting...

You can't aoe with frostbite
---
Permafrost is must have for pvp and aoe, same with imp blizzard at least 2/3
---
cant wait for the beta aaaa
---
Wouldn't be good advice for a guide though as only 1 person in the zone can grind on the hyenas, there's only 3 or 4 packs. If you're going to do this, keep it a secret imo.
---
Oh Chain heal is very good even without being specced into it. But if he went Elemental for instance a very popular build is 30/0/21 which lets you heal respectably well whilst still having everything good in the elemental tree.
---
Back in TBC before they nerfed twinks I had a insane lvl 19 Rogue twink. I spent so much time, effort and gold into making him unbeatable. I could go into Arathi Basin with 6 people defending a flag and drop all of them in 30 secs giving none where twinks. I was wondering if you ever got tickets from people complaining about twinks killing them with one ambush. 😋
---
Would you prefer a snoozefest experience where everyone waits around 20 minutes for a mob to spawn? I don't understand your argument. You will spend 20 hours getting to level 3 if they don't implement dynamic respawns.
---
I force myself to remember d3 launch to keep my feet on the ground...
---
Case reopened
---
100%
---
Here's what we know - there is no definite vanilla data on the exact HP and XP given by the hyena pack, but it's expected that on Classic/vanilla the XP should be reduced significantly for the pack.
---
Me three...
---
Or lack thereof
---
dont come crying to me when a beta doesnt happen.
---
You are still making a ton of assumptions.
---
Later.

It's actually employee, friends and family. I have an invite to it.

Lucky dude
---
The milestones. Level 10 hell yeah talents and weapon skills! (Plus a quest usually for classes) 20+ hell yeah a strong spell or two! I remember doing the quest for vanish? Or maybe it was poisons as rogue infiltrating a tower in Westfall sneaking passed people so fun. Of course 30-40 farming gold and buying dat mount! Etc etc can’t wait :)
---
I had a GM bug my character with a GM tag back in the beginning of WotLK. Everything I said in chats looked like [GM] skyst or something along those lines.  I was also invincible and could not be targeted.
---
So I went into the Alliance town and ganked everyone, doing yells so everyone would see the GM tag as I killed them. It was actually a lot of fun.
---
Eventually I was contacted by a GM and they asked me to log off so that they could correct the issue.  No other repercussions.
---
I see. 
---
Do you have a fan club online?
---
What is "loot rewamp" in phase 5?

What does this mean for the final release date? That's my main interest.

Except that GM you probably got fired.  If you had just put in a ticket to let them know of the accident you abused it to screw other peoples experience.
---
I only hope it was a newbie gm and he got a free pass for that screw up lol.
---
You forgot the Gnomeregan quest! &gt;:( 
---
:D

Triprunner Dungarees ([https://classicdb.ch/?item=9624](https://classicdb.ch/?item=9624))
---
At level 30 when you normally do the dungeon and you skip all, it takes like 35-50minutes and the pants give 1 1/2% crit and dodge at level due to agility.
---
No I don't want a snoozefest, I think dynamic respawns are a given. I have never met someone that played launch day on a high pop vanilla server that didn't think dynamic respawns are a good idea.
---
End of August.  Be patient.
---
I was thinking also that I would roll rent but collect healing plate since no one else can take it. What I am most concerned about is Ret in PVP. Anyone roll Ret for PVP in vanilla and how was it?
---
Play what you think is fun. I think a lot of talk about getting invited to raids is overblown. If you’re decent and make friends, you’ll get invited. Classic is as much about making friends and having fun with others as it is about min maxing and pushing the newest content.
---
i didnt downvote anyone but i did assume they would just use an internal cdn for alpha so they could roll out more updates faster.
---
i assume we can see how often they update the build with it being on the public cdn
---
Always wonder what could have been if the game wasn’t rushed. Hyjal was almost completed and was gonna house a raid. Quel Thalas was worked on but scrapped early due to time constraints. These are two of the more major lore locations in Azeroth. Then there’s the empty areas between Dun Morogh and Elwynn and Badlands and SoS, whatever’s north of Moonglade and south of AQ, the solitary quest that sent you to Uldum which is just a closed gate, the inaccessible but fully rendered Caverns of Time, the planned 40 man world zone Dragon Isles, Azshara crater battleground and so many things we probably don’t even know of.
---
a part of me wants to see these things finally added to classic after all these years
---
I think it will make you very happy to know that yes, I did receive tickets on this matter!  Obviously wearing gear wasn't against the ToS so nothing directly happened, but I am wonder if we sent enough players to the suggestion forums that it eventually lead to the nerf! ;)
---
Side note, if anyone were ever annoyed a GM couldn't help you and they told you to go to the suggestion forums, it really was the place you were most likely to make an impact!  The Devs definitely had a line of communication to the suggestion forums.  The GMs on the other hand couldn't just walk up to a Dev and tell them whatever that issue was, we were there so that wouldn't happen! :)
---
You're wrong. It's really easy to log in and check this for yourself. I don't know why so many people think the day/night cycle isn't based off reality. It's so easy to spend 5 minutes fact checking instead of spreading Fake News.
---
you're...incredibly wrong and being a little pussy about it. A GM back in WotlK wouldnt get fired for that shit. GM's used to be able to go on racist rants and shit in the official blizzard forums and not even get repercussions.
---
I mean if classic is wildly popular and brings in a ton of revenue they'll probably bring in Burning Crusade servers.
---
We can alwasys dream, Phase 7 Lower Karazhan 20-man raid (drop AQ20 typ of loot) Emerald nightmare 40 man raid (drop NAX typ of loot) and a 5 man dungen that drop fun blue gear, Plate of holy wrath, leather of defence, enchant +30 nature damage on glove, things that should have existed.
---
personally the way a game looks is a huge deal to me
---
I don't believe you. Please PM me your key as proof.
---
Enhance. Get Nightfall, learn totem twisting, and you can be a productive member of the guild.
---
Ret in pvp is pretty good in the right hands. Lack of a gap closer can be frustrating though. The reason they aren’t wanted in pve is because their damage is not sustainable. They will go oom quick so they can’t keep up in dps.

Yes he’s coming back. And he’s still a clicker.
---
Auto-what?  
---
Jesus I don't think I'd even recognize retail wow if I tried it.
---
Deep destro is good for PvP and you can google Drakedog for an example of how to play it. The thing is seduce-nuke is kinda busted in organized PvP where people on the other team knows how to play and there won't be as many noobs around as there were in 2005. In 2019 I would recommend going NFC like this guy: 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3iHXZXx7g0
---
It has more burst potential and doesn't rely on seduce.
---
play a warlock, its probalby something completely opposite of what u are right now. the time of the era and the type of class will create the true classic experience you want
---
Beta in one month and release in 3 months will be announced next friday change my mind
---
That makes sense actually, I guess you need a default experience. Thanks for the dialogue.
---
You get a upvote for beening so manly my guy
---
If you're going to get into it with a priest check and make sure you aren't near any cliffs first.
---
Does anyone know if things like the corrupted blood incident or kiting lord kazzak to stormwind will still be doable when those things get released, or do you think they'll patch those things? I really hope they just leave them as is, because I feel like player-made world events like that really add something special to the game.
---
If it's not about how the game looks why would it need new graphics. People have modern wow for new shiny models
---
&gt; if you are planing on ~~PvP~~ play classic, you NEED engi
---
ftfy.
---
I don’t believe you’re not a bot. Please send me your SSN as proof.
---
I like how they do that.
---
Doesn't mean i'm not super jealous though.
---
Though it will be sweeter when it does drop for real.
---
Not long now, we're in the final lap.
---
&gt;  and paladins can both tank and dps
---
Nice meme.
---
Doesn't really matter about the data. I too hope this happens, but there will be stuff like simcraft and icyveins etc. I'm sure it doesn't really matter.
---
a lot of people love druid but you sort of are the master of nothing
---
they have a fun playstyle for some but you are not really the best at anything
---
i love healing and ill definitely have a paladin healer but i neither want or expect to tank or dps in raids on it
---
Did the same, but the real deal will be diffrent I bet. You can invest so much time and effort without the fear of losing the character. Also its actually Vanilla, not some copy. 
---
See you in Azeroth!
---
I absolutely loved the trolling in trade chat. I was a part of it. 
---
On my realm we had someone who took it to the next level. He had a second account he used as his auctioneeer/trolling. Georgebailey was his name. He had maybe 12 macros all set for /2 ranging from "Girls dont play WoW" to "Is Metroid's gun a part of his suit or is he holding on to it". Absolute legend. I don't know if he had set up a bot, if he would do it himself. Georgebailey lit a fire in trade chat on the daily.
---
"Feign Death" Don't tell them our power move!
---
Oh right, good call.
---
Draenei in sw in vanilla? Wot
---
Probably an unpopular opinion, but i don't mind this - the shorter the actual beta is, the less time there is for people to burn themselves out on it before the actual release. It's coming out in the summer no matter what, and the less public beta we get the better for the actual launch hype.
---
Skarm tank on YouTube Can show you some amazin trick to druid in the pve seen so you Are not lost yet just need a guild og the right head for feral cat
---
Here's two from here, these were not hard to find:
---
&gt;But you hit the end game and you can't do anything as well as other classes.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I am a druid main in retail for like 8 years but I value group play and raiding so I won't be playing druid.
---
&gt;Fun yea but its pretty objectively one of the weaker classes.
---
Omen is the right choice here :P
---
Nooo :((( Though I guess I should be happy cause hopefully this means a sooner release without a beta and I prbly wouldn't have been able to play the beta.
---
Know any good speed leveling guides for classic?
---
One good swing of a two hand and the rogue is done.
---
I think that the veterans will be the minority
---
STVietnam. That's the best nickname I've heard so far.
---
Perfect analogy.
---
Correct, the character was turned into a chicken by a GM during vanilla, and is still a chicken today.
---
Literally the fastest way to farm gold for many classes is grinding certain mobs to sell their grey drops to a vendor. 500g would take 8-10 hours depending on where you are mob farming and with what class. If you're also herbing or mining, skinning, and maybe getting lucky with other drops that you do manage to sell, you can reduce the time even more. If you're just vendoring the leather stacks or herbs or whatever then you can reliably add that to your gold per hour and get closer to the 8 hour mark.
---
Lol this was real?
---
Certain loot in dungeons and on vendors (like the AV caster trinket) will be added, drop rate changes, and also item drop location changes.
---
i had no idea it was the unforgotten realms dude lol
---
love that series
---
i need to check out his new channel
---
Looking forward to drama sounds psychopathic. It'll be there, I'd rather not have it in the game at all.
---
I've only ever played vanilla on pservers, and the highest level I got was 27. I got fed up with constantly dying by playing solo, because I could never find anyone near my level to partner with. I'd come across someone every now and then and we'd do a few quests, but I'd never see them again. What I'm looking forward to the most is being able to easily find people to level with, since we'll all be starting at the same time, and many people will be daily gamers. I feel like classic wow will have what pservers lack; a larger and more dedicated player base. Sure, thousands of people play pservers, but hundreds of thousands will be playing classic. There will be no shortage of people to group up with. 
---
I also cant wait to join an actual guild, and stick with them for longer than a couple months. During my Wrath days, I joined and quit several guilds, because most of them were no help at all. No one was willing to do dungeons or raid seriously. Most of my raiding was PuGs. Itll be awesome to level up alongside my guild mates, and when enough of us get to 60, to finally do some vanilla raiding, which I never got to do.
---
Classic WoW will consume my life, and I cant fucking wait for that.
---
Not a vanilla screenshot, character received chicken form buff from a GM back in vanilla days, still has buff.
---
Pretty common on RP servers
---
You can get 50 gold per hour from farming regular mobs and selling grey drops if you know what you're doing and choosing the right mobs. So yeah, plenty of ways to do this without dire maul farming. Adding in a gathering profession like skinning, and just vendoring the leather, will bring you closer to 60 for that 8 hour mark. And if you do get lucky with green items such as backpacks, diamonds, etc. and manage to sell those, you can start shaving off more time.
---
He's not saying this picture is from vanilla, he's saying a GM transformed him into a permanent chicken BACK in vanilla and he has saved the character since then.
---
Relax bud.
---
Respect, my dude. I appreciate the effort you went to since like a lot of folks I played almost exclusively horde way back when. I’ll take a drink in your honor.
---
Having a server reputation as “That geared douche Gnome Warrior who escorts lowbies through contested zones/runs them through dungeons for free”
---
These are incredible!  I genuinely laughed out loud.
---
NA CST
---
I had a green one for my orc rogue.
---
Looks fantastic imo to this day.
---
Yeah, its essentially a different game with a similar skin.
---
Truly one of the best dual wield combos for the 35-45 level bracket, both for combat rogues and fury woyers. The main hand is Vanquisher's Sword, a quest reward in RFD. The off-hand is Sword of Omen, another quest reward from an SM quest. They also have pretty cool looking item models. There is another sword that looks just like Vanquisher's Sword but it has a flat cut off tip and is an epic BoE if I'm not mistaken.
---
30/0/21
---
Heal during progression. DPS during farm status. PvP. All in one spec.
---
You dont. Get hit by a car. 4 month coma and paid medical leave.
---
that's why i'm going reck prot :D
---
Disappointed but hey at least they told us exactly what it was and didn’t cocktease us. The level of transparency the classic team has with us is amazing, love these people.
---
Upvoted for the shoulders
---
Awwwww :( ... But good to know. It seems they are watching this sub.
---
The old graphics will just improve the feeling that it’s the same game. If it were the new ones it wouldn’t feel original.
---
dude.
---
 
---
get with it.
---
I saw a GM once when I asked him to show himself aftee he resolved a ticket for me. It was in Orgr and if I recall correctly it was a Tauren spawning in front of me. 
---
Tried that a couple of years later and the GM who  was handling my ticket told me they weren't allowed to do this anymore.
---
Yup, one was definitely chockablock with high level elite chimaeras.
---
What makes you think you'll be getting any work done once classic comes out?
---
RIP but at least they gave us a quick Update.
---
Min-maxing means less in vanilla than retail even.
---
It's old content, nobody cares, nobody's impressed.
---
Just have fun and ignore meters, and if your guild actually somehow gets uptight about meters in the easiest part of wow then just go to another guild
---
Yikes
---
Why can't it be both?
---
As a paladin, you should consider getting Verigans Fist at level 20. It's a bitch of a quest line, and you cant do it solo, but it will last you until the mid 30s. It's the best weapon you can get as a low level paladin, and it's only for paladins.
---
Comin out of my coup and I’ve been doin just fine~
---
Not really. It could just mean that there won't be a beta phase open to the public, which makes sense.
---
i wish drakova still streamed, gave me hours of entertainment :/
---
I hate leveling alts.  Love to play with just one char, grow with this char.  I will be going for honor farming in wpvp,  soo no alts.
---
I think it's the other way around.
---
That is hating on druids? They are objectively weaker than other healing classes, dps classes, and caster classes. That's not hate or shitting on the class but stating the downsides of class. Every class has them.
---
I was the first rank 13 druid on a popular private server. I will roll druid on vanilla release but I understand their flaws. Pretty much 
---
​
---
Fun yea but its pretty objectively one of the weaker classes
---
I would not play if it had the new graphics without an option for the old graphics.
---
I think Durotar, barrens, ashenvale is a good start, thousand needles is alright too.
---
Those weapon skills tho
---
How would you define "hating on" within the context of talking about classes in WoW then?
---
wtf that quote is wrong, it's 'I do not think think it means what you think it means'
---
You can port retail WoW mounts into private servers. Requires a custom patch though.
---
There is not so much good plate healer gear besides the set gear, and the tier 2 is the Best for dps so its nice
---
Then what have you possibly seen? The vanilla private servers have thrived for years and years and they've all been waiting for this moment. There is absolutely no reason to think Classic will be a small thing.
---
Made use of the UD unlimited breath racial to farm the repeatable, lobster turn-in quest in Shadowtusk Village over in Desolace. Every turn in was about 50s I think and took about 5min to get the 10 lobsters from the underwater traps, so I think it took me all of 8 hours real time (plus the  50g or so I already had) to pull it off at level 40!
---
There will be a 10 minute video about it for sure.
---
No
---
Ding dong your opinion is wrong
---
[The Deer Hunter](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077416/) if I'm not mistaken. Loved this movie!
---
Look at this dude. Giving anon advice on reddit saying execute switching is bad. Saying you should use a slow weapon on execute phase is fucking retarded LOL you want to have a hit on the mob in between every GCD so you go "execute-hit-hit-execute" for max deeps.
---
Discord will be the most used. The only downside I know of is that it can’t compartmentalize.
---
I had that shit in hunter too, still in my bank.
---
Me four...
---
Seeing the cities populated with players. I've fired up the retail game recently and it's so sad to see Thunderbluff completely empty. I know it was never the main Horde City but I never saw it empty in vanilla. Even the Undercity only had a few people running around.
---
I also kept gear and weapons that I grew attached to in my bank. To the point where half my bank slots were taken up by low level gear. It pained me to have to get rid of them to make space. Sometimes, I'd equip some of them just to see my character wearing them for that little hit of nostalgia. Good times.
---
Launch is 22nd August. 13 years to the day that Drums of War (patch 1.12) was released.
---
Nothing being easy &lt;3
---
Sounds great, but how is it fairly easy to achieve? Can you provide a specific example? I can't seem to grasp it, honestly.
---
One personal question - why you left Blizzard?
---
Unfounded criticism?
---
Hating does not = founded criticism....
---
I have one question.... WHAT ARE THOSE?!?!?
---
Go druid my pet
---
&gt; August seems more likely.
---
I hope so. I want to enjoy summer outside.
---
"A lot"
---
Well I wish you had said that in the first place. Can't say I agree with that, but at least I now have a better understanding of how you see things.
---
@Marlamin, Apr 18
---
&gt;Something that I missed during the Classic deploy last night, they also added it to the http://Battle.net  App where it is currently named WoW Classic Alpha meaning Blizzard is currently still handling this as Alpha testing. 
---
Two days ago, straight from the guy who got the client to launch.
---
Playing wow with my irl friends again. The anticipation is killing us atm! 
---
The need for other people to get shit done is something that i really miss. I seriously can't remember the last time someone aksed for some help with something and thats really sad, the social aspect in retail is so dead.. The only people I talk to is my guildies, even that is starting to die down. M+ was a fresh scent in Legion and it actually felt like the social aspect was returning. 
---
In bfa all I think when I am online is:
---
"Why do i bother?" 
---
Sorry for the rant, but fuck retail.
---
Yes but you can raid as restoration and respec for pvp like most other shamans and priests. The raid spec for ele and enh is going to be different than the pvp spec anyway so he might as well be useful when hes not pvping. Enh he could swing nightfall when its released and your guild can craft him one but before that he'll be pulling a solid 250dps and be bringing improved WF, so if he truly cant heal then that's the best option imo. Ele he can pull 300 dps bring nothing to the raid utility wise and go oom after about 40 seconds of casting. It's unfortunate but in vanilla hybrid classes just didnt have the talents to dps effectively.

10/10 shitpost

All the internets today, friend.
---
My guy ... wait I forgot I’m on the most neckbeard sub on this shit site
---
Warrior shines in 39/49, but has some utility sticking on FC’s and healers in 29’s. Warlock with full shadow damage gear will do great in 29 and 39 they are very strong too. With a premade locks can really shine anywhere
---
Ita just because the people at blizzard want those world firsts. Scummy
---
I think it will spike at the start and then stabilize. Old players going back and new players who have never seen it before (there's an entire generation that never got to experience it).
---
I was 14 or so when I started playing and I am now 28 years old and dad. I absolutely miss classic but I don't think I'll be able to get used to the old playstyle again. Classic and retail WoW compliment eachother depending (Retail content draught, spike in classic, etc).
---
Im s shareholder give me alpha keeeeyyyy.   
---
LEEEEEEETTTT MEEEEE IIIIINNNNN!!!!
---
I think most people who are serious in the twink scene prefer to play against other twinks/premades. It’s not all about stomping others and graveyard farming. Getting competitive wsg is a blast :)
---
wtf
---
That could be true. I was just going off of how well July 16th fit in if they already were Alpha testing and were about to begin Beta, instead of just now starting Alpha.
---
Hopefully not, but you know how it goes with giving someone the OK on a 'necessary evil', even in small amounts. The temptation will be there for Blizzard to use sharding far more than people were expecting, beyond just the starting zones.
---
I know several of the team have already spoken out against sharding and their plans to limit its use, so hopefully they will be able to keep it in check. 
---
Ultimately though, it's one of those things that will always itch in the back of your mind unless they specifically state and affirm, without doubt or ambiguity, exactly when and where it will be used.
---
Hey blizzard it’s me your cousin
---
The problem is, after an expansion or two it becomes harder and harder to convince new people to play the game when you tell them they have to spend 6+ months leveling before they can play with their friends.
---
Isn't that the whole point?
---
Wrath is overrated.
---
Wpvp made by players is the best content
---
It is because a lot of people are really upset and feel betrayed by Blizzard for how Live is. They want Classic to destroy Live so that they feel vindicated. Can't really blame them.
---
Doesn't alpha mean there is still a lot to work on and it's still early in development? How does this sum up with a summer release?
---
I just dont see how stating things that are truthful equates to hating though.
---
Good.
---
Retail in a couple years.
---
If Classic hits 10mil+ subs you can bet they will start moving people off Live and working on ways to monetize future Classic content.
---
Congratz you bought our game, now heres a boost to Skip all our game
---
World firsts in a 15yrs old video game LOOOL
---
It is known.
---
Not vanilla
---
&gt; People are going to consume all off the classic content and then go back to Retail.
---
Maybe some, but most people don't play it now for a reason that won't change.
---
the experience bar is only half full wich means he propably stopped leveling, talents and dungeonfinder are disabled wich means hes under level 10, has no bags and an empty main bag. so yeah he propably just made a new char after he was chickend
---
They already said that we get legion like water, + a option to make it vanilla graphic water. Same with shadows.
---
If you are interested, here is the "Restoring History" panel from last Blizzcon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKkP8LryYM
---
They talk a little about animations too.
---
The problem with vanilla is that unless you and your "leveling partner" are playing at the exact same pace, it's hard to really have a leveling partner. Unless you or the other person wants to wait while the other person plays catchup every time one of you gets a couple levels ahead.
---
Yeah I only knew about the shadow engine.
---
Are these things real on retail? Almost feels like a horror scenario.
---
Seeing a precious shiny mining node and saying to myself "Omg omg have to get it before someone else does" 😁
---
You sound awesome
---
This is the truth.

---
Ya it's a very uncomfortable uninviting feeling.
---
The auto loot toggle is client side so I'm not sure what tbc data would have to do with that. Vanilla servers run with a 1.12 client
---
It's not a weapon multiplier but slow speed still matters, you still take an out of turn melee swing.
---
That's why combat rogues still used slow main hand, warriors preferred slower for both hands.
---
Something as simple as "Man, how am I supposed to get past these three mobs?" Lol
---
If it was in graphics options as a toggle, I wouldn't mind it.
---
No problem, let them play video game. Also make sure, they ll know how to handle smartphones at the age of 2-3
---
Blizzard will release the game when it's done. Not earlier not later. When it is done.
---
I know this is meant to be facetious, and most of the responses are written up in jest, but I have an actual answer to this, that worked out well for me when I was doing server-first and world-first races.
---
It's quite simple, really.
---
"I don't go out. I don't drink. I don't smoke. I don't do drugs. I don't cheat. My vice is video games. For less than 20 bucks I get one entire month of entertainment. Everyone in the world says, "I need X to unwind!" and they grab a beer. Or a joint. Or a cigarette. Or a hooker. Or something. Me? I sit quietly at my computer and play. This is how I unwind. Now, either I can do this, or I can NOT do this, and go explore the many other irresponsible and likely dangerous things that most other adults engage in to alleviate their boredom, and unwind their stress. What would you like me to do?
---
It's kind of a bitter pill, but it's logical, and hey, it's honest and real.
---

---
 The beta may still happen...
---
In software, betas and alphas have specific purposes. Alphas are to ensure that systems work, and numbers are right. Betas are to ensure that the hardware and networking work properly, and that the number of people intended can actually connect and play. Alphas are to get the game right, betas are to get the experience right. We will probably still get a beta, so relax and hang out until then.
---
I get down voted all the time for speaking realistically too.  People are just stuck in their ways and want a perfect world.  Upvote for you!
---
Because the game itself is already made.
---
But I don't want to wait til December.
---
Why do people actually watch those?? I watched one once, and I never plan to watch any of them ever again. Or streamers for that matter. I want my 9.5 minutes back.
---
If you're on the European servers see you in the jungles of stanglethorn sir!
---
How does it make sense? Blizzard has PTRs for every single patch, and they do betas for each and every expansion. How does it "make sense"?
---
Let her make the decisions so she can experience the game how she would like to. Also don't go ahead of her. I would make a character you will only play together.
---
Probably late late late summer, knowing them
---
l o s e r
---
I didnt think I had to specify "not a public classic private server" like many here play on. Yeah sure any asshole can setup a private realm to film footage or make an image like this.
---
A Thursday? And companies tend to shy away from the 13th of anything, for superstition reasons, and tradition.
---
There's new possible screenshots that are more recent from the beta files released in the new Tipsout video which may or may not be more updated.
---
Not necessarily. Alpha just means they're testing it before the public sees it. Alphas are intended to test the game itself, and the systems/mechanics/numbers in the game; betas are to test the hardware and experience of gameplay. We might get a beta within 1-2 months, for all we know.
---
Combat rogues use slow main hand because Sinister Strike and Backstab are actual weapon swings based on weapon damage that ignore your speed, so at equal dps you want the slower weapon. The same for Whirlwind, Mortal Strike, Slam, Stormstrike, Aimed Shot, Multi Shot. Paladins don't have such an ability so they typically care less about having a slow weapon  But skills like Execute, Bloodthirst, Eviscerate, Arcane Shot, Swipe do flat damage regardless of weapon damage.
---
Can you explain how weapon speed has anything to do with an out of turn weapon swing? Your casting of the ability depends only on the cooldown and your available resource (rage/energy/mana). Not your weapon's speed of damage. You don't hit harder or spend more/less rage based on your weapon or anything like that.

Countdown to Classic is the best
---
The high agil basically makes those BiS until mid-late 50's.
---
...time to access the neighbors open WiFi
---
Maybe your main goal in classic WoW should be not being such an ass this time around.
---
The people in this sub are just salty.
---
Fuck sake I really hope they leave it. One of the changes I can get behind to save on my carpel tunnel.
---
ITT: People not sure whether this is parody or serious.
---
Thursday perfect for those looking to book time off for a long stretch through release and also good to stress test a bit before a crazy first weekend.
---
Yeah... can relate
---
I want to go rerolling!
---
I think we're agreeing and I misread your comment.
---
And we’re just hearing about this now? And no pics from any other x-pac? I want to believe.... but can’t.

If Hot Pockets are still on the table, I'd say you're g2g

There are some good ones under the class mechanics section of the old Nost forums. Most is based on Nost values, but its solid info for s lot of classes. 
---
I like shadowpanther.net for rogue stuff.

I can't hate on a guy taking care of his kids. That's sacrifice right there!

Hey sir, it's me your blizzard employee
---
I'm working on this strat ATM, but also concerned this may become "normal" for her... this poses a serious risk
---
If they played the game originally then they gained that knowledge in-game. Obviously newer players who don't play Vanilla servers won't know it though.
---
If you wanted to till some soil, yeah.
---
I wish I had known they would release Classic WoW before I started dating again
---
Nice - I won't feel bad about stealing his gf AND ganking him in WoW Classic, that way!
---
BRILLIANT!!
---
Dude brought it up 2 days ago in the Vanilla GM AMA.

This post is just him providing a screenshot for people that wanted to see it.
---
Aww. We'll here's to the Blizz employees - we've already seen the Classic team make leaps and bounds forward, now we just need the rest of the company to tear it apart so we have an even more polished product come player alpha/beta.
---
They released the beta files to give an unofficial confirmation without giving anything official so if they need to change the beta date or something people won't lose their shit. They know that if they say anything official and change or go back on it, this community is just waiting like rabid dogs to tear them apart.
---
They let us know that a beta *is* coming at least.
---
Precrush, Postcrush

Google and urban dictionary have failed me... Am I being "whooshed" or is this "chinba" some ultra meta thing?

Made me laugh 👌
---
If you want to hang out on discord, you can find me and plenty of others on the Countdown to Classic discord. New people always welcome!
---
I thought he was trolling :(
---
This sounds nice, but imagine all the old armor on new models. Or they would redo all the gear which would be a huge amount of work.
---
Guild name though
---
Nicely put. Seems logical
---
You shut your filthy mouth.
---
One day, one can only hope...
---
I think druid would be really cool. It’s one of the classes I’m thinking about. 
---
Check out this guide: https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/
---
They have a place in a raid as a hybrid off-tank. You could tank some fights, dps some fights, and even heal some fights.
---
I enjoy them
---
i mean yeah. its pretty boring cause its that one sided. the pala just dies, not alzot he can do.
---
yeah, technically you can get them at 25 if you get some high levels to escort. And you basically don't replace them until Devilsaur pants.
---
He has 3 different spawn points. You can feign death your way into this big main room and use a target macro to see if he has spawned. If not reset the instance. If he spawned you can reach him with a cat with stealth and eye of the beast to agro him. When your cat is dead at his spawn point, he will then run to you standing at a safe spot, without pulling any more mobs. You can then kite him with wing clip. Hes not really a boss, just a strong mob. This will of course only work if blizzard stays true to the original vanilla. This belt is in my opinion also bis for pre raid.
---
Maybe some green boots of the monkey will do
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Magnificent_Greaves
---
Yeah, I was a Hyper-Toxic troll Cancer Kid when I played.  Would wipe groups on purpose if I didn’t like them, camp bodies for HOURS at a time, ninja loot etc. 
---
Gonna try the other end of the spectrum this time around. I’m not a frustrated child anymore.
---
Can't upvote this enough.
---
There are more than enough quests, you are just skipping them.
---
Enhance hands down. Ele is literally just lightning bolt spam, if he wants to do that then he should just roll mage.

Please note: rogue was naked the whole time  
---
Rogues in vanilla were sorta like that...
---
I think the game will have a ton of new players at the start but after the week/weekend of them playing and realizing their progress (which won't be much since they'll be new) they may realize they don't have the time to dedicate to actually thoroughly enjoy the game. That won't apply to everyone, but for the average person who may not have much time to play, to essentially know they'd never reach max level might turn them off.
---
Ya don’t get back from Honeymoon until the 25th August 2019.
---
This will surely be the release date. You heard it hear first.
---
OP you’re scaring me I can’t tell if it’s real or fake
---
EYYYY HOW YA DOIN?
---
Also downvoting this one too. Don’t take offence to it lol. Just start posting your OWN content instead of trying to get upvotes 👍
---
I played a warlock :) But I remember meeting a mage at lvl 40 in menethil harbor who was Jealus of me
---
There's a really good article regarding how long certain things last, comparing WoW to TV shows. The comparison the writer of this article (can't remember who, sorry) draws points out that most long-running TV shows tend to die off after 15 years max, and often the writers often must "reboot" the show. This sometimes entails a restart. Their theory is that Blizzard may be testing the waters for that very sort of "restart" - which could take any kind of form, either following past expansion models, or completely changing the story for a whole new experience...  
---
I sorta hope this is the case, somehow, but only time will tell - but I think a large part of it is up to the playerbase, so let's make this re-boot as successful as we possibly can!
---
It's implying that the goblins are Jewish
---
In Islam and Catholicism it used to be forbidden to charge interest on loans because it fucked people over (probably cos they had no idea about maths) whereas in Judaism there was no such rule
---
If i remember right this is one of the reasons the Jews were kicked out of so many countries
---
I specifically mention low gear levels, serpent sting sucks ass because it doesn't scale with gear, but when you have no gear the global for 555 damage is not terrible.
---
I have fully decided on a undead mage. I love the dance, laugh, mount, starting area, and of course free food and water plus ports to any city. I had a max mage in vanilla but he was a stinky little gnome😋 But I loved em
---
That sounds like heirlooms, meeh
---
I'm just curious to know if I will have to purchase BfA in order to play WoW Classic. I'd like to renew my subscription, but I have ZERO intent on buying/downloading the current client. I have logged into my Battlenet account, but so far, it doesn't look like I can really do much of anything at this point.  
---
What am I missing? Or has this information not been fully released yet?
---
I do hope they take it in a different direction. Maybe TBC and Wrath with some changes to keep them more within the spirit of classic. Then different expansions using the new design principals.
---
For all the people down voting: Please point me to the one thing listed, that you find so ridicules that it will never be implemented in retail !Remindme 1year
---
&gt;I could go into Arathi Basin with 6 people defending a flag and drop all of them in 30 secs

Why take the damage and let them get the dc heal if you are going to ice block anyway?
---
who cares? retail i shit and everyone knows it, why bring it up here?
---
Look, it's our rank 14 to be.
---
I enjoy them too. I dont have to look through hundreds of small 2 line comments in reddit to get insight, I can just listen to some guy put out his opinions.
---
Can you please explain the use of /camp to me?
---
This is the worst meme I've seen on this subreddit.
---
WoW kills WoW. Who'd have thunk it!
---
No one will care about my discussion of a topic and  direct  response to someone's question?
---
You seem to confuse bragging with veracity where i'm trying to  help someone make their decision about what class they want to play on a game that we all want to enjoy by providing anecdotal feedback.
---
Chill out
---
I suppose that's a fair point
---
The demo was not finished. They said their goal was to recreate the visuals as close as possible ("maybe not pixel perfect" but close).
---
only if you don't know the quests.
---
Under what circumstances would someone be pulled out of the world for causing trouble?
---
I always felt that the fame just makes much more sense as a hunter, there is a reason for me to kill X amount of animals to cull their numbers, or collect Y amount of their parts. 
---
Plus back in the day leveling up pets and feeding them actually made you care about what pet you had rather than just constantly swapping them out. 
---
So I’m a hunter for life
---
Press F for tipsout
---
its not true, just lack of knowledge.
---
Easier to get a new job than to get invulnerability on official servers so I'm fine with that.
---
You will still be playing WoW. That's all that matters to Blizz.
---
There will also be new players on Classic, players who left WoW and others that never played before.
---
Preferably in opposing faction zones. Because they will be doing the same to yours.
---
If you don't wanna heal then I'd say hunter. They're both bis PvP classes, shaman is more fun tho imo. 
---
No other classes that you have considered?
---
Everyone has that one friend with 9 alts but no max level toons
---
&gt; so I know as a hunter I'll be gimped by the deadzone  
---
So you think your deadzone means you'll be completely useless in PVP?  
---
Stop.
---
Especially when you want to zone out listening to an old album you just discovered - fishing while listening to STYX/Dream Theater is one of my favorite WoW memories
---
Any one else read this in an Russian accent?
---
It depends if they advertise it. If they do they could get A LOT of new players, in wow classic or into mmorpg genre as a whole.
---
A high number of people got into mmorpg in 2004/2005 with wow vanilla as their first mmorpg. The game is just that good. Doesn't matter if w're in 2005 or 2019, most people who will give it a real try will get hooked. The question is will they market the game correctly to try and get new people into it ? which in my opinion would be great
---
many things.
---
- Not having to do things on a daily or weekly basis, I cant farm whenever and whatever i want, exactly when it suits me.
---
- No transmog, you can actually see what gear people are rocking
---
- No war and titanforge, Ill know what gear comes from where and what i need to farm, not just being lucky in a few m+ runs and raids.
---
- Server reputation and hopefully that means people dont act like total retards.
---
- Being friendly actually has benefits.
---
- Unique classes, everyone cant do everything
---
- Gear is not easy to get and everyone wont get it.
---
They will do it because unless they say they won't, everything must be assumed to be 1.12.
---
My main was a hunter from release till 2012, loved it. In vanilla wow, hunters were OP in world PVP &amp; in BG’s. The deadzone wasn’t really an issue if you knew how to play your class well. Scattershot, wing clip, concussion shot, frost &amp; freezing traps, meant a good hunter should always get away. Factor in you had a pet attacking all the time too. With bestial wrath, you could kite away and stay at range while your pet nukes the target.  
---
Shammy’s are awesome too, I’m starting as a shammy in classic and leveling as ele, and going resto at 55. Shammy healers were hard to kill also in vanilla, they had so many heals. 
---
Hunters are great for farming as you can tag 3-4 mobs and have your pet tank them all (especially the gorilla’s, with warstomp aoe).
---
I have been playing some Retail casually recently while waiting for Classic. I could not believe how the sharding works now and that auto-scaling was added. It totally destroys the open world MMORPG atmosphere. It's so wrong, I don't understand why they did it.
---
So difficult... I am going to try ever so carefully to focus ONLY on first aid... but ignoring cooking is going to be incredibly difficult! Maybe if I only start ONE profession... xD
---
Deserved we one the not but wanted we post blue the
---
Nah that doesn't sound right
---
man, i would clucking *love* to see that!
---
I'm all for the classic experience and haven't played much WoW past TBC and I think that having an **option** to switch to improved graphics is fine. People forget that graphics were improved in Vanilla WoW too. I don't believe this enters the slippery slope argument because it does not interfere with the game mechanic.
---
Things like this are reasons I refuse to pay for retail.
---
I think I'm still stupid but how did his message imply that?
---
The guys who do them are super friendly too, which I think feeds back into the whole "community" aspect of classic wow that we all enjoy.
---
Say for example Kargoz, all his long format live videos show him just chatting with people and going with the flow, it's quite nice.
---
Upgraded graphics with the dark nights and vanilla weather would be pretty badass
---
All more reasons to never pay for retail
---
WE ARE PREPARED!
---
Indeed, really want to start a new character on a private server for the last few weeks but I'll hold off knowing I'll just burn out during retail classic.
---
...yet more reasons retail is a waste of money
---
Warhammer Online PvP was hella fun at least.
---
oh god this spec... it hurts
---
Im assuming this means a late summer release? :/ Atleast the Classic team is transparent and tells us straight up, WISH Blizzard would do the same!!
---
Posts like this remind me of why WoW was way more popular than EQ (besides being newer, looking way better, and having fantastic series associated with it).  At least in WoW you get dropped into a noobie area and worst case scenario you bumble around and kill some mobs to level ... EQ you just get lost in your starting city and never make it out(I'm looking at you Neriak).
---
It's nothing like heirloom. Need to remember that WoW was the answer to the hardcore grind of EQ and FFXI like games. You a level 30 item might be the best equipment for 1 function of your job, but FFXI has the unique mechanic of being able to switch gear in combat with no penalty.
---
The result? Having massive amounts of gear in your limited inventory and using macros to swap pieces out for just 1 skill.
---
Some people dont have time or want to check this subreddit everyday, how else would you figure out what happened during the week?
---
Keep in mind that alpha testing for something like this could be much faster than other games.
---
When a new game being made enters alpha it's usually to make sure that the base systems of the game function properly, but there's still tons of content that needs to be created and added to the game.  Entire systems of the game might still not be in place, which is why it happens very early in development and usually doesn't mean the game is close to coming out.
---
But since Blizzard already made this game, they're pretty much only testing out the base systems.  This alpha will probably be for very basic stuff like making the sure the game launches without crashing and (as was even stated in the blue post) making sure people can log into the game through BNet.  Beyond stuff like that, it's not like there's tons of content that they still need to develop and add to the game.  All the quests are written and added, all the models, textures, spell animations, musical scores, etc are already made.
---
We might be pleasantly surprised by how quickly this alpha turns into a beta and then into a release.
---
I'll be doing both - but I got most of my playtime questing in horde before the cataclysm revamp, and barely did anything at all as alliance.
---
One of the first things I will be doing is *gleefully* being ganked by hogger.
---
Then I'll see about playing the half of the game I never got to see.
---
Seriously. It's easy if you've got the time and knowledge.
---
Ahh this is bittersweet.  I hope I don't go into to much detail here.
---
Before I worked at Blizzard I was coaching Ice Skating, and for the first couple months I worked at Blizzard I was doing both.  Life was really kicking me in the ass at that time, so I decided to quit coaching and just focus on Blizzard, get my life straightened out.  
---
While at Blizzard one of the reasons I left the GM floor was because I wanted to join the training team and train classes of GMs.  They had a lot of amazing trainers so positions didn't open up frequently.  I didn't mind, I loved working there and figured I would wait my turn and join the department they were in.  
---
I still really missed coaching so I decided that I would apply for some coaching jobs and try to balance both again (while going to school, I don't know where I thought I had all these hours) at the same time a training position opened up, but I didn't get it.  I was a little sad but the person who did was really great as well, that's how it goes sometimes.
---
Then I got a call back from the rink I wanted to work at most, a top training facility in my area with lots of people to work with and Olympic level coaches there, the perfect place to build up my own business and learn from some amazing mentors, I accepted.  I still wanted to keep both jobs but I knew Blizzard would have to end eventually if I was going to grow there, then I got called into the office and offered a position on the training team.  I was so happy, but had to decline, I thanked my managers very much as it still meant the world to me.
---
I stayed there for about a month longer but I was starting to get busy very quickly at my new place so I made the full switch over.  My team threw a going away party for me at CPK. I missed it very much but kept in contact with friends there and gamed with them as well!
---
I'm no expert but the figures I've normally seen are up to 70/80g an hour for unpatched Mage/Hunter DM Farming.  
---
I'd imagine sad mode holy priest/resto druid/prot warrior Tyr's Hand grinding or something would be like 20g/hour.
---
Bro, I feel your pain, I am praying for July 30th release date, otherwise I'm going to still be deployed in Croatia when it comes out 😪😪
---
warlocks get hit real hard in pvp as alliance, due to horde being 30-50% undead (which have an active ability to remove fear, charm (from succubus)).
---
Shadow priest get hit slightly less from that fear counter.
---
Also 30-40% of classes in vanilla are warriors which also have immunity to fear.
---
Rogues/paladins are less efficient as alliance due to the orcs (25% chance to resist stuns) which are the 2nd most popular race on horde.
---
Were you guys angry about the fact that players could glitch / wallwalk into secret places?  What would you do if you ran across a player doing this?  Hyjal was my favorite.  Could you ever actually get to the creature in the deeprun tram?  I tried so hard.
---
I kinda understand, I have no idea about that game, but when I see that you are able to equip something that sounds like level 50 weapon on level 1, its sounds kinda too op :D
---
This 4K quality... I Love it!
---
It's level scaling, same as some RPGs do like TES Oblivion and Skyrim. So mobs in a world zone are scaled to your level. There are still level boundaries on zones, but for the most part at any level you can go to many zones and all the mobs will be within a level or two of your toon.
---
It's stupid.
---
No one can tell you the numbers because most gold comes from the ah and this depends on the server.
---
There are some trash item farm like DM Tribute but who knows if the pserver numbers are right.
---
I would say that the mage is best for aoe Farm, hunter for dungeon and brain Afk farm
---
Devresed ew eno eht ton tub detnaw ew tsop eulb eht.
---
Hmm.. not that either.
---
Having played a paladin, a mage and a warrior I can tell you there really isn't a huge difference in gold per hour. It more has to do with how easy it is. A mage can in 5 minutes HS and start farming in dire maul where 40-60 g is a brain dead farm. Dire maul is however nowhere near the best farm in the game gold wise. Farming righteous orbs with a strong group can be just as effective but it takes more effort. 
---
Another thing you gotta remember is that all classes don't need gold as much as others. There are some exceptions, like DMT solo runs for hunters or ZG solo runs for mages. ZG is only really good for the first couple weeks though when the demand for bijous is high, might just be a private server thing. Anyway, I wouldn't base my class choice on anything like gold farming. 
---
You can make plenty of gold with just professions. A good starting point would be Mining + Herb / Enchanting + skinning. Skinning is only really good past lvl 60 if you're going for devilsaur leather.
---
Ps. Warriors are master race
---
xqcS
---
I've considered warrior, but I did level that in vanilla, as fun as it was I do wanna try somethin else, sadly im not big on spell casters either, and rogues just not my flavor of choice ya know?
---
.
---
This or Shadowbringers... You know Blizzard will try to drop it the same weekend.
---
Yeah I was with him until that point. What??
---
Let's hope this means it's still not too late for true progressive itemization.
---
What about the all the whining about class imbalance on the forums.
---
They just want us to play their shitty retail wow all summer.
---
I got a pair of gloves of holy might while farming gorillas for skins. Went to the AH. next morning I got my mount.
---
I personally can't wait for the humour system and it's hilarious rewards.
---
The most likely scenario I can think of off the top of my head is they were exploiting a bug, we needed them to stop, but we were still getting information from them.  
---
Another might be if someone were spamming a major city with a game breaking bug.  We might remove them to stop spamming, but want more info from them.
---
Generally things like this though.  They are causing trouble, but in a way that we would have needed to inform ourselves about.
---
Congratulations! And for your sake I hope it’s released end of August. I really wouldn’t mind. I want to enjoy summer too
---
What 2 nights a week do you want to raid? My guild is going to raid Friday and Saturday from 11pm to 3 am EST.  If you are a night owl east coaster or a west coaster, it could be a great fit.  DM me if you’re interested.
---
yes tournaments. but not solo streamers
---
I agree with the first half, but I'd wouldn't expect Blizz to redirect retail to be more classic-y. If classic players are paying their monthly sub still, why risk alienating the others?
---
The solo gold farmers that I saw were mostly Rogues. Hunter is also a good farmer class.
---
They will be separate, so no.
---
I feel you've made some big, unwarranted assumptions here.
---
Firstly, you seem to have ignored the fact that I listed creative writing as a skill. I know many people dismiss writing as an actual skill that requires genuine investment to develop to a level of quality that people will accept and enjoy, but that's a not the reality. The reality is that I have a skill there that most people do not and this skill is probably going to drive a bulk of the non-mechanics-based labour that goes into this project and will absolutely be criticised in the final product.
---
Secondly, if anyone signs on to this, this will be their project as much as mine. I'm not asking anyone to labour under my banner. Anyone who signs up to do free work on something like this is an integral and irreplaceable part of the team.
---
Basically, this is why I was hesitant to post earlier about this. The work of having to justify reaching out to people and fend off this entirely predictable criticism just sucks.
---
Definatly go warrior
---
The information we currently have strongly suggests that you will just need a subscription to play Classic and that buying the current expansion will not be necessary.
---
Haha, its understandable. This rule actually didn't apply to weapons usually. The best weapons in the game at the time took a average of 1-2 years of grinding to achieve. Plus a massive amount of money.
---
Think of the armor swaps like this. Hand piece X gives accuracy which is great for auto attacking. Hand piece Y has strength which increases the damage of these skills. So you will swap to the strength hands when using those skills, then back to your auto attacking hands with accuracy.
---
((())) are called "echo parenthesis". You can google that phrase to learn about etymology, but it suffices to say that when you put something in ((())) it implies it's connected to the jews somehow.
---
Scaling is one of those ideas that sounds promising, but didn't really work out in practice. It was an unsatisfactory answer to some other problems. 
---
But for quests, I think I've heard green quests still give full xp, so as long as they don't grey you're OK
---
Yeah my bad i should've read your mind based off of two vague words you're right.
---
I really want to down vote you for this! But I wont. :P
---
Schedule a holiday or "sabbatical" from work lol
---
I enjoyed killing people with my druid on that little island far north-west of Ashenvale. It was an Alliance only quest hub, and I could stealth and escape with aquatic form, so there was little danger and I could pick my fights.
---
And it has, I believe, the longest corpse run in the game. You absolutely can't put your character on auto run in Ashenvale because of the uneven zone, so you have to follow the paths manually for 7-8 minutes. A lot of fun, certainly.
---
Not angry, but it was something we didn't want you doing.
---
For the most part GMs understood it from the players point of view, you wanted to see every nook and cranny of the world you could by any means necessary.  There were some GMs who would have been doing that too, had they no had the ability to see themselves, haha.
---
From that point of view we were understanding, and in turn if we asked you not to again and you complied, no harm no foul.  If we have to keep getting you unstuck and ask you not and keep doing it, then it's different.
---
Hyjal was a favorite of mine because we got to see it in a training exercise we did before BWL was even out.  It was pretty mind blowing even then.  I don't recall about the monster in the tram, but we could walk through any geometry like a ghost, weren't bound by gravity and if needed could move at insane speeds.
---
It was a promising answer to some of the problems with retail leveling, but I think they undervalued that feeling of danger &amp; progression. Scaling has its pros, but between that loss &amp; the other issues left unaddressed, it's hard for me to really get behind
---
Nice troll, go play retail it is your dream game

" Hey folks! I’ve got a small update here to help quell some of the rumors  and let you know where we are at for WoW Classic. We recently began a  phase of **internal employee alpha testing**. The new build data that many  of you have been discussing over the last few days is simply part of  this process. "

Really now?

Why do so many want to rush to 60 anyway?

I've never played a shaman, but I did have a ton of fun as a hunter. Although I did enjoy a paladin, I felt like multi purpose classes were kind of lame. At least as a hunter, I dont have to worry about people expecting me to be a tank or healer when it came time to raid. I hate healing and tanking, and I'm just plain bad at it, and I would feel pressured to heal or tank if I was a shaman. I'm probably gonna main a dwarf hunter once classic is released, so I can actually have fun doing what I want, instead of what other people want me to do.

How to beat a rogue as a feral druid.  Spam bear button. Seriously only way to survive vs a rogue was going Bestform and slap back onto only do you have more hp but you got that nice thorn ripping them to shreds. On both hand attacks.

Go caster to try and get a heal of and your dead from stunlock.

Not to mention this statement is false as

When you hear the bzzooom sound from stealth in stv I wasn’t worried at all since there is a ton of stealthed mobs in that zone.
---
same here man
---
gagging to rock a vanilla toon but i know even with beta id be done for by the time launch came round
---
Lol I'm sorry dude but this isn't happening.
---
That doesn’t really line up with their “Get ready for a Classic summer!” statement though
---
Then some pencil pusher goes: "Oh great, how can we improve this to make even moar monies. I know! LFG-tools, flying mounts, IAP's.. genius"
---
I'm sure they wont.
---
Won't they?
---
They did last time.. I mean.. LFG and flying mounts weren't even a good idea the first time they implemented it.
---
Nah..
---
From my biased perspective, I'd imagine the relationship between classic and retail will be reminscent to RS3 and OSRS'.
---
Getting rewarded putting hours and hours in the game.
---
I never played a game that got the reward system that right
---
Oh wow TIL. Thank you!
---
No you don’t. You just need a basic retail sub, they announced this at blizzcon.
---
The funny thing about Drama is, if it happens to another Guild, it's so damn funny and entertaining.
---
If it happens in your own Guild, I'm the fuck out.
---
Kek came from Starcraft, after we realised that watching professional Korean games was horrendously entertaining. It was present before TBC.
---
People keep making these threads but nobody realises vanilla isn’t like classic....literally every class has a counter or downside in pvp, that’s how it’s balanced.
---
Everyone keeps hoping for a class that can be an unstoppable force, go play retail then because every class has everything!!!
---
Rant done.
---
Hey, you sound just like me back when I was 12 years old!

Just a disclaimer I don't use the triple parentheses as it's generally used by genuine anti-semitic people

When did I say pve skill ceiling? Did you fail to read the pvp reference in the following sentence or do you just not know what that reference refers to? It's a general statement I made towards the dude who clearly doesn't validate the different nuances mage gameplay has to offer, be it pve or pvp.
---
"kek"

well Cenarion Circle was easy thanks to the overpopulated pvt server.  There were always Silithus Lord summoning raids that auctioned off the blue and epic items dropped by the summoned bosses.  I was doing it mostly for the items, but ended up with the rep.
---
Not sure if that will be the same on official servers
---
I wouldn't touch a shaman as a rogue if I knew I couldn't one shot them
---
That music tho
---
Hate to burst your bubble but blizzard know 100% that anything they upload to the client will be instantly found by someone, meaning they knew someone would find it very fast and decided to wait 2 days to release a statement.
---
They intentionally cockteased
---
10 minute fights? Ehh, this conversation is over. Clearly we're not playing the same game.
---
I guess I'm just fidgety because I want to re-start as soon as possible
---
Stockades is like 25-30.
---
RFK is 30-35. RFD is something like 40-45.
---
I've been hoping this hasn't changed - would be nice to at least see the same "pre-purchase" option available for Warcraft III
---
Thanks! Can't wait!
---
this makes me happy, plenty of time to enjoy each phase, wont have people rushing naxx
---
I wouldn't compare the two. In that first year, the whole of 2007 backup of rs was available. It would be like releasing classic with naxx out, or maybe just with molten core forever etc. King black dragon was like the end game pretty much before they added GWD.
---
Simply opted to post the weapons, as those are propably the most important.
---
Interesting post.
---
As blizzard does care about their shareholders and such, they like to make money.
---
It looks like at 45 bucks a share.. it may be a good time to buy.
---
I just hope they can maintain a solid amount of customer service on top of genuine content.
---
Why be nervous... when she leaves you won't even notice because you are in the WoW zone ;)
---
Are you looking at just WoW financials or all of Activision/Blizzard? Because they have a lot more games than just WoW. They also have King (the makers of Candy Crush), CoD and a few other major franchises that probably affect their financials a lot more than WoW.
---
Hey Blizzard it's me your son.
---
I wont be mad about that statement if the game comes out in the summer. I don't think many people realistically expected the game to come out beginning of the summer, but yeah, of cause they want the hype train to continue, "Get ready for a Classic fall!" wouldn't really help that.
---
As Shadow in Tier 3, I could manage around 45g an hour grinding mobs at a nice pace
---
Does it hurt Your peepee or Your poopoo?
---
The community
---
Your brother got to duskwood in 3 hours? damn hunter powerlevelers..
---
This doesn’t mean there won’t be a beta though. Just that it’s not as close as we thought.
---
Wait, current zones autoscale to your level??
---
We should all just expect a September release by now and tamper our expectations.. Wouldn't be the first time Blizzard pulled a wordplay like this and watch as us, the fans spiral into unparalleled hype typhoons.
---
Commenting so that I may observe in 1 year.  It's a time share.
---
No, because it allows them to push their dps further without wasting gcd or energy on threat reduction.
---
I like having a mage alt for gold farming.
---
Yes but you lose the buff if you die. Melee fighting looks pretty awesome though!
---
Herbalism will always be close to most gold farms. On pservers every class can farm 50g/hour pretty consistently. Mage ZG farm is 100+g/hour if done correctly, and tribute is 120g/hour, so it's a fair bit faster.
---
Hunter DME can maxium get 50gold per hour, but if you have good gear and do it well you can farm that 50g in 40 mins and "effectively" making 66g per hour.
---
Druids are my favorite class by far. We arent the best class but its loads of fun.
---
People remembering each other.
---
Do you have any actual link for that? Would really be appreciated :)
---
ahhh, I hated hogger, I died several times.
---
Activision Blizzard's revenue in 2018: $7.5 billion.
---
Let's be generous and say Classic will have a stable 300 thousand subscribers. $54 million / year revenue.
---
Which is 0.72%.
---
I adore Classic but I think people in this subreddit might want to temper their ideas, at least when it comes to financials. :)
---
Because old people waiting for classic will listen to literally anything regardless of how long and boring it is just because it's somewhat classic related.
---
Can't really compare an alpha of a recreated game to an alpha of a new game. 
---
It won't take long to get things fixed.
---
I agree - and I hope it changes the scope of current MMO's
---
It does seems a reasonable schedule. September definitely is not summer though, technically or otherwise.   
---
Still,  I don't think many would be surprised if they slipped a little.  Estimating a finished date far in advance is always tricks and to be  honest I value the fact that Bliz wait are prepared to push release back  a bit in order to improve quality.
---
I can understand that. That bear was a great pet too! Also I can imagine how hard it was to get him, a long path... but worth it!
---
Agreed. If there is one thing this sub on average knows shit about it is the financial impact of Classic. Lets not even pretend.
---
Not losing my char to tbc expansion, blizz lawsuits, or priv server GM corruption.
---
Now. I’m going a to b.   Only.   Oh sweet look a herb over there.   Oh another one.  30min later, where was I going?
---
are you like i was?, you se someone else with a nice swlrd, and/or armor an think " i want to be lkke this"?, just play your charakter set yourself to experience the game with your charakter, maybe make a backstory for it aswell?
---
I don’t know what you mean by “Classic release saves Blizzard/Activision”. Wow is just one game. The stock had corrected recently but ATVI shares are around the same price as 2 years ago, more than double what they were 5 years ago, and around 4x what they were 10 years ago. It’s been on a general uptrend, and probably overshot a bit and corrected (amongst other things like the general market and their actual financials/news of firing people/etc.) 
---
Of course Classic could improve their total WoW revenue. They are a company and aim to make money and will do so with Classic.
---
There’s been a lot of talk about what comes after...because they are aiming to make money, coming out with BC and Wotlk is the most obvious possibility. Assuming Classic is decently successful, this would be a good plan to keep those subs with minimum investment on their part, and they could squeeze some more money out of WoW. If Classic flops they probably wouldn’t bother. If Classic was wildly successful/maybe overtook retail/etc., maybe they would actually considering investing more time and money it/adding additional content/etc. However, even if this was the case (Classic being wildly successful), BC and Wotlk would be arguably just as good or better for maintaining/increasing that success, with less costs, and really seems the most likely from a business perspective If WoW is the success we hope it will be.
---
Periodically fresh servers for classic, and BC and wotlk If those happen, seems like a possibility down the road as well to maintain subs as long as posssible for those iterations of the game, if there was a decent base to maintain and no new shit being released (like Cata or new vanilla content). 
---
I say BC/wotlk because vanilla and those 2 are the most popular times of the game, and represent a different approach to the game from a design perspective, and are the most likely to attract people that aren’t already playing retail. Cata seems a bit less so, and then it really drops off after Cata imo, but we really don’t know what they might do. New content or progressive servers through all expansions are always possiblities, especially if newer expansions wouldn’t have to be recreated.
---
But for now I think we should just be excited for Vanilla and hope for BC/Wotlk someday if we tire of it, as that’s actually a likely scenario that is in my opinion also a good one.
---
Hand her a set of divorce papers... because by definition if you have a wife you are not no-life'ing ;)
---
Considering his screenshot is like 4k res, its fake.
---
All of ATVI. And yes, they do have a lot of other games, so I'm probably missing a lot of data here. I just drew some of the overall numbers relating to the game and company financials - there's a lot of viewpoints/perspectives one could derive if you continue to dig deeper, but at the end of the day, I have to think that Blizzard desperately needs to build a longterm plan for WoW, or it will eventually die sooner than we, or they, will want.
---
In an alternate universe, maybe the kurzen compound would have been a stormwind outpost, but bandits do as bandits does.
---
Many zones got their level requirements lowered though. Plaguelands is 40+ or something like that
---
Dang. Good point. And 300,000 Classic subscribers is a large number for a 15 yr old game. =/
---
I asked a GM to spawn Onyxia in Goldshire and he did it.
---
So... how many times do you want to post the exact same comment in this thread?
---
When you would appear in game to players, did your characters actually wear the blue mage outfit like was advertised in the original game manual?
---
... Why are you even reading WoW subreddits in the first place...
---
BEST post ever.
---
Holy crap this really is me. I didn't like wearing my glasses so I'd just play the game in blur.
---
The big difference is that Alliance get more power out of +STR and +AGI things.  The -30% threat is also easier to use on the alliance side and was quite critical for dps warriors.
---
Unless... EVERYONE CAME BACK and 4 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS started playing CLASSIC WOW, and it generated $720 MILLION!!!!  
---
...ok I'll quit dreaming now. =/
---
Well, still not as many times as Blizzard will ask for you to pay for something extra in retail... =D
---
I really tried to get herod’s axe instead of the cup, my editing skills are so limited
---
I think youre right, but if you get buffed while mounted, it stays.
---
Definitely possible in vanilla however BC is when pallys really kicked off. Used to play pally tank in TBC but I never got my Figurine of the Colossus :(
---
I won't be able to buy a character boost, buy tokens trade tokens for gold buy epic flying, go into blizzards shop and buy a flying mount for $20.
---
I want people to show off the work they put into their character. If you can just spend money and get the same thing it makes everything lose its value
---
I can show off an epic mount in vanilla and people will compliment me. In retail if you don't have an epic mount you get laughed at. Things are easy to the point that rewards are expected and not earned.
---
The best example to give for the loot revamp, is the addition of new relic items  such IDOLS for druids and librams for paladins. existing loot table from bosses get adjusted, from the time I remember the dungeon sets became alot more likely to drop to allow people to get 0.5 sets
---
Horde is gimped. They get wf totem but when the boss fight require dps to not over aggro, paladin salvation buff allows them to put out more dps. Other small things like dwarf priest fear immune buff, +sword and mace vs +axe skill, and how close ally city is to brm make raiding as alliance easier.
---
So she was cool with you playing 12 hours a day for 6 months and not working at all? And how did you end up getting out of the WoW hole and back into employment?
---
No judgement, I'd just like to know the full story as it's pretty mad!
---
In their last quarterly report they did break it down by segment. Just blizzard had 35 million active monthly users and they credited a lot of that to hearthstone and overwatch, while saying the dip in wow subscriptions was expected. 
---
https://investor.activision.com/financial-information/
---
That suggests to me that microtransactions are their leading revenue generator. Which isn't surprising. And why Diablo mobile is going forward despite the backlash. Their hope is probably that classic helps retain subs between patches and maybe drives traffic to retail, with new players buying boosts and tokens. 
---
If that strategy works then I'd expect tbc down the line. And future wow patches to be more classic friendly. If classic blows up and drives traffic away from retail then it's a tricky situation because they'd want to monetize it. Since that's better revenue over subscription, but doing that would kill classic all together.
---
With auto-questing so popular these days it wouldn't surprise me if that and one or more of the above listed makes it to retail some day.
---
I strongly recommend Druid (or Shaman) + Warrior.  
---
My gf and I leveled fresh Druid/Warrior for Wrath and I have never felt more powerful in-game.  
---
We never lost world pvp, got to run instances whenever we wanted, and our instance groups never failed, because we could always replace DPS or just run with fewer people.  
---
And in BGs, I had heals 100% of the time, and she had a warrior peeling 100% of the time. It was better than any other leveling experience by far.
---
So summer is a little over a month away and the alpha testing has only just started now? pretty much confirms if this is comming out early summer we wont be having a beta, little to no time to even test anything.
---
Aye hc warriors going human never heard that one before in me life who needs wep skill lmao
---
That first dft drop *om nom nom*
---
/camp logs out. Logging out in an instance brings you to the start of the dungeon. So you run the dungeon, /camp and log back in to teleport to the start of the dungeon, zone out, reset instances, and zone back in for another run. You can do 5 runs of a dungeon in 1 hour before it locks you out.
---
Out of hunter and shaman I'd pick shammy. Remember though, there is a 50 g respec cost in vanilla so to raid as resto and PvP as enhancement will be expensive!
---
Yes, you are right. But not only for 45 lvl. You can hold it till Maraudon, and replace by "thrash blade" from quest.
---
Good points. Guess I just secretly hope(d) for a new timeline, with a nod to the good instances from TBC/WoTLK. But, as another guy pointed out on this thread, even if Classic is wildly successful, it's highly unlikely to make enough of a splash that would warrant the cost of all-new development. Suppose ya'll are likely correct in your assessments!
---
you sound mad
---
Nah, I'm just bored, and want more without paying for it. =D
---
imagine caring about vanilla pve when all the raids are piss easy.
---
Because I love you as a brother, I voted Holy Paladin
---
I literally made it up lol 😬
---
I fucking hate scaling enemies, even in single player rpgs. It is such a stupid concept, that is clearly just a convenience for the developers. The gameplay reasoning "oh but it is to gibe you constant challenge and the freedom to go wherever you want", yea bullshit. It is done, so they don't have to worry about properly scaling the enemy level growth to the player one.
---
But it just ends up removing the feeling of growth from the player, which is a major part of an rpg.
---
2 min scim through a guide telling you everything you need?
---
Nah lets make a 10 min guide on how to skill fucking engineering instead
---
Vendor rare items like the Magic Essense were on timers, and I dunno if they start on server launch.  All it takes is one dude to do this and you cannot get the mats.
---
Waste of time imo, founded on the P-server madness.
---
There are also several competing wands from various quests you can get around level 5-7.  
---
[Cinder Wand](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?quest=99)  
---
[Elven Wand](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?quest=957)  
---
Not to mention the wand is obsolete around level 10 anyways.
---
I'll have to read that when I get home. I'm just killing time at work atm. What you mention here is a legitimate concern - I'm kind of hoping that the playerbase is maturing as consumers and steering away from microtransactions. But that also might be a pipe-dream, as the way things seem to be trending it would be more likely WoW becomes free-to-play but you can buy armor/mounts/etc. (and that would be horrific).
---
Resto druid if you wanna play more casually.
---
Prot warrior if you wanna go dig bick.
---
Summers like a month away theyre gonna be LUCKY to even have closed beta by june/july and theyre gonna continue to pretend to be better at communicating bc we got mad about them firing the one guy who communicated but their communicating is just “hi guys we know u want communication but heres nothing” and we keep saying oh yippe least its communication lmao
---
what great character names
---
There WILL be a shortage of tanks, and I am too lazy myself to do it, so I vote tank for you ;)
---
The new graphics overall look a lot more crisp and imo better. One thing I don't like however is how the cold blues are so "cold".
---
You want to be talked out of it , and everyone tells you how awesome it is ;) I'll try to help you and play the game with some warning.
---
I was a Drood main from vanilla launch (MC, BWL, AQ40, no Naxx)  to woltk.
---
Dungeons, leveling will be fine, no issues here. Nobody cares as long as you do your job, don't die and group can start the instance.
---
You most likely will be resto for all raids until you have proper gear to tank. To tank a raid tear you will need stuff usually from the next raid tier. So most likely off tanking raids on farm. Competing on some items with other classes. This also means you will have between 3 to 5 sets of gear to collect (tank/resto , some pieces also if you want to solo/dps in cat outside of raids , and the appropriate element resistance sets for the role you will play (tank /resto) in raid.
---
If you intend to tank and heal , then you need consumables for both role. How much will depend on your guild , more or less hardcore.
---
If you hope to be decent dps wise in cat in raid you need to farm an item that has charges that expires when consumed from a low level instance. Otherwise, forget it unless your raid lead doesn't care(could happen).
---
Remember that vanilla is about attunement and reputation farming as well at different point in time , it will take you longer than other classes depending on your gear. You might want to farm more because 2 roles to fill.
---
So, if you want to raid and main a Drood , then be prepared to spend quite some time collecting a ton of gear. And be ready to give 110% to reach the game level you need to operate properly.
---
This is vanilla Drood , not TBC with mangle + proper itemization which was awesome  or later expansions on retail where Drood is on par with any tank /dps/healing class.
---
Don't get me wrong , play what you want , I will most likely play one again in classic (still struggling between war prot/hunt/shaman tho )
---
Drood is an amazing class in vanilla, but a demanding one at max level in a raiding setting. What guides show is how awesome the class is when fully decked in gear collected by hardcore players , playing for a long time. This will happen to you eventually later in the cycle of classic , but expect some long depressing phase sometimes , and joy when you get that item and you start to shine.
---
Do what you heart tells you anyway, but you have the untold truth behind those great and awesome guides crafted by top players :)
---
Cheers.
---
Not really related, but when you said "retail classic" I realised how amazing it is that we're going to be able to play Vanilla on official retail servers.
---
Anyone who says druid is bad in vanilla was bad themselves.
---
I think he was more referring to the fact the graphics don’t make the game so special, so updated graphics aren’t going to take that away. Of course that’s his opinion (and mine to a lesser extent).
---
I know that at least for his leveling guides, but I think others as well, Kargoz posts the powerpoints  he uses in his videos, so you can just read the slides at your leisure instead of listening to him talk about it. Not so much entertaining as actually helpful, though.
---
And you're looking at it with modern eyes. Back in the day questing was something considered for "filthy casuals", most hardcore players were coming from way harsher MMOs were grinding was the norm.
---
I don't think Vanilla beta was long enough to establish a good questing route, especially since there were still big quest holes in later lvl. I'm pretty sure 90% of his XP came from grinding.
---
Even in late Vanilla some HC players were still grinding to get to 60.
---
Ungoro does not have a southern hub. You get a quest at tge entrance and one can be found close to it. But there is no camp like in Cata+
---
This is a very good analysis of the potential future of Classic, but you are missing out on one thing that I think is important to consider.
---
Assuming that Classic is wildly successful (meaning that Classic generates unique subs that rival that of Retail) rereleasing old expansions cannot revitalize the MMO genre, which, lets be honest, is necessary for WoW to continue to generate revenue long term. The genre has been losing popularity for a long time now and something like WoW:Remastered (Classic sensibilities, but talking advantage of the lessons learned over WoW's lifetime) has the potential to bring the MMO genre back.
---
More likely that you get them to 10 hp and suddenly 3 more rogues show up
---
To be honest it's very hard to imagine that I could find someone who would be cool with how I spend my own time. All those women seem to be taken ages ago, probably very few single ones exist at present time.
---
In BG premades it's pretty unlikely you will be healing them at all as you'll be a FC. In PuG BG's you bring roots and FF for rogues but realistically, you'll get picked out and spend alot of time in Bear form - Which ofc means you then can't heal the warrior and everyone knows what happens to a warrior without heals.
---
Now that you pose it that way makes tons of sence
---
I think bfa visuals is garbage. Not form the technical standpoint, but from the artstyle. Ruined Nagrand from WoD, ruined Orgrimmar, shit tier Arathi rework, both the zone for the Warfronts and the bg, orcish side of the WSG is shit while NE side being ojay, most of the new races outside of dwarfs and draenei look terribly cartoonish. They probably changed most of the art designers and maybe they are doing a decent work, they are not doing Wow graphics 2.0, they are making it look very different and when new + old artstyle collides it looks clownish. Plus too much cartoonish for me, vanilla and tbc looked like more "realistic" fantasy than WoD-BFA.
---
Imagine being this stupid
---
That makes perfect sense. The people are voting otherwise, though.
---
You can agro him with a stealth cat and he will not come at you with the other surrounding mobs once he killed the pet ? oO
---
Why are you linking boots, we were speaking of belts ? :D
---
./afk
---
It really doesn't.  It fixes shit that was broken, like level 42 green belts being BIS till ragnaros.
---
As a rogue player, this brings joy to me, knowing that the sound queue makes people nervous and alert. Inflicting fear without doing any damage is a great weapon.
---
Humans can also hit their capital EASILY at level 1.
---
Hey man. Back in 2005, I was 5. I played with my dad on release, we played together until he quit in cata. I still play to this day, 14 ish years later with 800 days /played under my belt. I played together again with my dad on a vanilla private server last year and made a succesful raiding guild to re-live that. We progressed up until naxx. Go for it man, the game taught me such good English at a young age as well that my high school let me stop following classes and just do the final exam for it.
---
Absolutely horrific lol. I think there is a good chunk of players that would never touch a cash shop. But the whole reason they are profitable is because the few who do spend a shit-ton. Enough to make it a necessity for studios. 
---
If they go osrs model I'd expect them to try a vanity shop or something to fund the development, unless they've found a way to make new content with minimal manpower. It just wouldn't be profitable otherwise. Maybe they'd charge the old 50 bucks plus subscription, idk.
---
I highly doubt blizzard has any plans now besides "let's get it out and see what happens". So everything I'm saying is just the best guess from someone who has no idea what they're talking about.
---
Missed the boat to feathermoon isle!
---
Reminds me of all the bads saying you need 440 defense to tank MC hahaha.
---
Note that I only every got up to about level 25ish running around the world looking at pretty things, killing low level mobs. I wouldn't kill longstriders because they made a sad noise and it made me feel bad. I don't think this game is violent at all, it's really cartooney. It also taught me how to manage money really early, because of how gold works just like money. Reading your post made me jump a little at the thought of someone else getting to live this beautiful fantasy world at a similar age.
---
Lvl 19 pvp xD
---
For some people sub fee increased by 35% sadly.
---
Yes there was an announcement that there will be no stat changes.
---
Also, Blizzard only has 1.12 data. They said this explicitly. *Everything* will be 1.12. All they do is hold back things (instances, items) until their respective phases.
---
Here is the latest blue post detailing content phases: https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-content-plan/120346
---
Notice how they are talking about "drop rates", "drop tables" and "drop locations".
---
Not a huge amount, as you said they are probably the weakest pairing, but there is a few unique things about druid.   
---
   
---
Stealth is probably the biggest one, that's pretty cool as a healer to only pop out and heal when no one expects it. You also get pounce for a stun out of stealth which can be very handy. Fearie fire is super strong vs rogues preventing vanish and restealth even out of combat. Druids also get abolish poison which is great vs rogues, and they also get remove curse which can make warlocks very annoying vs the other healers. You get feral charge for a spell interrupt and to kite/snare people, bear bash is great when it lands, hibernate comes in handy vs 3 classes.  
---
In general druid is pretty good against hunter/warrior/rogue with their kiting outside. Against other classes the lack of magic dispel is just brutal though. For instance if you fight a single mage + something as a warr/druid you're not going to do much. A mage can just poly the warrior and... then you have a sheep instead of a warrior. If it breaks the mage can nova the warrior and then your warrior is stuck for 8 seconds. A warlock can put up SL/Corr/Immolate on both of you and sacrifice a VW for a huge shield. A priest in that situation could dispel all the dots and the VW shield, but a druid can't do anything - just try to heal it. So yeah often being a support druid just sucks.
---
I believe they tried to add Arenas and it failed very miserably.
---
Paladin dps was heavily PPM based, and so a slow weapon was crazy on the damage scale.
---
100 dps 2.0s = 200 avg damage  
---
100 dps 4.0s = 400 avg damage  
---
Lets say 6ppm for SoC.  This is around 1,200 extra damage for the 4.0 speed over 60s, or 20dps.
---
I didn't know i smacked food that fucking loud back in 2006 damn.
---
Classic is not a Remaster. It's a recreation. They aim to make it look *exactly* like it did (with *optional* improvements from the modern engine, like improved shadows, water and larger ground clutter distance).
---
See the "Restoring History" panel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKkP8LryYM
---
Me too
---
Oh yeah, definitely. That last part is spot on. I just don't think we can derive much from their financials without knowing all of it instead of just a part of it.
---
The gaming market has changed. You said it yourself, the genre has declined, it’s not just WoW. That’s another reason I think WoW: Remastered is less likely, it would probably need high max potential to justify it over BC/wotlk, but there isn’t necessarily the same market for MMOs that there was a decade ago. There is A market that, for us more old school gamers that want to revisit things, and some newcomers that are left wanting because of the current void in the space...but the whole reason that the void is there is because a lower % of young gamers these days are interested in a huge time investment, slow moving, subscription, etc. game. They like quick rewards and paying even once for a game feels shitty now when so many games are free, so $15 a month seems horrendous to some of these people. IMO there may have also been more draw to the exploration of an online world/meeting and talking to others before people were so used to the internet/social media.
---
I’m actually pretty optimistic for the future of WoW: Classic btw, just less so for the old-school MMO market in general.

At first my dad gave me an add-on that put small marks on my map for what to do, I couldn't read the quest text. Skull meant go kill something, some other markesnt go collect something. It was a puzzle to me to figure out what to do. I clicked my abilities and loved it. I loved trying out new classes. One time I made an undead but he was so scary to me I asked my dad to delete him for me, I was afraid to click on him in the character select screen. I loved trying different races and classes, just to find out what kind of abilities and racials they had. I played on a pve server so I could always just play safely and not get bothered by gankers. I loved making little potions with herbalism/alchemy once I figured out how professions worked. Or mining stone to make small bombs! Playing this game is how I grew up, it taught me morals with need/greed on loot etc, and not to trust everyone out in the world because there are ninja looters/rollers! I sincerely hope you let your kid experience what I experienced.
---
I don't think there will be a shortage of tanks for raids as much as for dungeons. Guilds usually fill up the tanking spots really quickly.
---
Or maybe they're trying to get the game ready and it didn't cross their minds that they have to release statements before they upload a game to their own servers for their own testing simply because someone will go out of their way to datamine it. 
---
Let's also face it, they shouldn't have to but bravo for them for coming out so quickly to inform us.
---
Ab a druid will not be a pocket healer for a warrior. They will be anchoring a node.
---
In wsg, they will be running a flag.
---
Druid heals will be purged away and healing touch is too damn slow.
---
Male dwarves are bis shhh
---
I will probably make one for wpvp once my main is at raid log stage. Like a lvl 49 hunter or whatever to fight 60s.
---
... What?
---
You make datamining seem like a much bigger than it is, and that Tips has to play it off as someone doing it for him \*if\* he did it?
---
Legacy-wow has a pretty good fury warrior guide
---
Not exactly sure about class yet, but think orc warlock. Rolling PvE because I like to just kill boars and get my zen on without some griefer raining on my parade :) I do want to pvp some, but I like to be able to choose when to go to TM/BG.
---
Perfect opportunity to make an alternate timeline and do what they wanted to do with TBC and WotLK
---
Its call spell healing and spell damage.
---
I wouldn't say that ESO has fallen. But they certainly lost their opportunity to grow big on launch hype.
---
Your memory is failing you.
---
Maybe spend 1 minute googling, rather than writing 10 paragraphs on why serpent sting is good lmao
---
Microtransactions make more money for blizzard than subs do.
---
I mean wow at its prime didnt come close to cames like candy crush and bejeweled.
---
Healing done was very much a thing.
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?item=16923](https://classicdb.ch/?item=16923)
---
Bamboozled again.
---
&gt; for the life of me I cannot remember
---
What made us think that we were wise, and we'd never compromise.
---
It was actually the opposite and it happened in TBC.  I missrememberd the direction as well until I looked into it.
---
I feel you! After playing Orc Warrior, smashing and bashing I wanted to try something complete opposite of kill or be killed in 10-15sec!
---
I leveled as a Holy Paladin just to be the dude who never-ever fucking dies! As long as I have mana I can tud away for ages! Even leveled first aid so I could save mana when in buble! The fights were endless in PvP, and I could solo kill elite mobs in 10ish minutes!! - no one expected to encounter a healer solely trying to heal in the lower BG brackets either. I was mister annoying and I loved it!
---
Kept googling, and found that this change was made in 3.0.2  [https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch\_3.0.2](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_3.0.2)   
---
\&gt;  All items and effects which grant bonuses to spell damage and spell healing are being consolidated into a single stat, Spell Power. This stat will appear with the same values found on items which grant "increased spell damage and healing" such as on typical [Mage](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Mage) and [Warlock](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Warlock) [itemization](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Itemization).  
---
\&gt; For classes which do not heal, they should see no change in the character sheet other than new tooltip wording.  
---
I guess this change was made in WotlK, not Vanilla
---
Hi, /u/WestSlavGreg
---
I think you are misremembering.
---
I watched a few videos but usually their "content" is reading the text. Frostdamus does some original content alongside standard news videos.
---
Modern players can't do it. They will drop off before max level.
---
Down vote for truth has been a recurring theme in this sub. I've often been downvoted, called a moron or blizzard fanboy simply for stating things that are realistic or obvious. 
---
The thing is, for things to seem realistic or obvious you have to have a little bit of basic understanding of development. Not specifically game development but development in general.
---
It's often people downvoting what they don't understand because it clashes with their already set view on how things are supposed to be.
---
It also made me look up to my dad so much, he raided back in real vanilla while I was exploring redridge on my elf. I watched him down ragnaros, I watched him down prophet skeram. Sometimes he had time to boost me in a dungeon I wanted to see, or let me walk around the world on his account to explore high level zones. I found a crystal cave in un'goro, it was so pretty I was super excited to find it. I was jealous of his epic horse, I didn't even have a level 40 character. So I made a hunter to get aspect of the cheetah, it's the closest thing I could get. I never leveled a character that high in real vanilla, I was born an altoholic heh. He let me play his 60 rogue on his account when tbc came out, over the course of the expansion I leveled it to 67. It's still 67 on his retail account to this day, and that character is a fragment of the past I sometimes revisit now. I got it the orange hat from a quest, because it let me conjure up a drink every once in a while. I played with a low level weapon but I used it because it looked cool (rapier). I'll stop rambling now, you opened up a can of memories with my dad and I wanted to share how amazing this world can be to the young mind.
---
Raid holy and pvp rank holy. After you are done ranking pvp as ret and respec for raids.
---
Plz add hyjal in 1.13
---
He didn't say he took the screenshot in vanilla you bellend.
---
Frostadamus is great. Very good content, he doesn't have to scream every 3.5 seconds to keep your attention. Plus his ui looks amazing
---
Do not cite the scrolls to me, witch! I was there when they were written!
---
We keep the balance!
---
Just make sure she can heal. It's what women are for.
---
Some people enjoy the race.
---
And you, Bloodyfoxx, a random ass dude on Reddit would know that! Please.
---
Speed boost trinket from badlands quest.... think it's called nifty stopwatch? Requires a frost oil and some easy chain quest killin rock elementals.
---
That depends on what race you are
---
Yeah, definitely.  
---
My old man brain mixed up the upgrade from Lightbringer (+healing done) to Judgement (+damage and healing done) with this change.  
---
It's a silly thing to mix up, but it was all so long ago! xD
---
Yes. I remember a warrior in my premade pvp group being teleported there because he was accused of account sharing for ranking.
---
Oh nice! My first character was a female Tauren Hunter named Flowerhoof :) I started playing on one of my friend’s accounts, so sadly I don’t have her anymore but it wasn’t long until I made my own account and another Tauren
---
Vanillagaming is a priv server that's been out for a long time. Many things will be different on blizz servers but if you want the basics for any class just Google "vanillagaming [class]" should see tons of forum posts. Hope this helps.
---
Here's the [Atlas](https://i.imgur.com/xSY013u.jpg) I bought during Vanilla.
---
Thanks I
---
And people *talking*. Logged in for the first time since 2013 yesterday and everything was just completely dead.
---
I made one just so I could get the first 20-25 lvls down a few days ago. Haven't had much time to play it. I know I won't burn myself out on it tho, Dong undead and then gnome warlock just so I'm not clueless on release. I don't think I've lvld a room since.... Cats when I had each class maxed then. So it's been a long minute since I even been in starting zones lol
---
they have been doing this for 15 years and it did not cross their mind that, that would happen? i see
---
I don't quite remember the order but going from Shaman to Hunter was quite the revelation.
---
The realisation I could nuke a mob then just bail; rinse; repeat. And without massive downtime.  
---
The realisation I could kite literally any mob to death. I remember being level ~30 kiting level 60 mobs just for the hell of it. Hunter damage wasn't mitigated the same way as normal physical damage so you could wean them down.     
---
Elites guarded by a ton of mobs? No problem, I'll just kite the dude for miles!
---
Can confirm. Wasn't hyped for classic at all until the last 2 weeks. I've watched a solid 15 hours of videos on classes, items, and all kinds of shit. And after 3/4 of 'em I'm just like "ya.... I knew all that already. Why do I watch these". 
---
Then I look up at the other 4 videos I have open in other tabs and watch another. Lol
---
Alpha = We know there's bugs
---
Beta = There's probably bugs, but we fixed (or actively chose not to fix) everything we know about
---
Gamma/Release candidate (Often skipped if the software can be patched easily) = We think it's good, doing one last round of testing to check
---
Cause he wants it to mean that. Duh
---
nice one brother
---
Just wait until SP Plate becomes a thing, you become a raid boss.
---
Holy/Prot for insane heals and SP reck bombs.
---
Yall ever consider just getting fat and depressed and never doing anything besides work, games, and a bit of family time? Works even better if you work nights. 
---
Lol
---
Why do they usually release on Mondays/tuesdays? Is it so the workers have 4-5 days to fix shit before the weekend? Always wondered
---
Started my vanilla jorney as a gnome rogue. Lvl 45ish and stacked with spirit gear. ”regenerates health” sounded like the best stat, soon I regenerate so much health that I’ll become invincible!
---
Not sure I get the joke, but anyway I'll add that my build won't be utilizing Starfire at all ;)
---
I think you’re being downvoted by the truthers who believe black holes are responsible for more human deaths than the government is willing to admit.
---
Perfect length for the drive to my gf's house, keep it up!
---
I guess I'm not racist like you lot ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
( /s )
---
Thanks for replying, I understand compromises have to be made in order to sustain a healthy relationship but demands like that from one partner to another seem entitled to me. 
---
I'd never dream of saying anything like that to my gf, and I'd expect the same treatment in return from her or else I'd begin to feel like I was being controlled. 
---
I lived in a house where my parents would fight about stuff like this all the time and I suppose it's all about how you frame it. Want someone's attention? Ask for it, plan something etc. instead of calling them out on what they've chosen to do otherwise. 
---
Not saying your wife is calling you out or anything, I'm speaking more in general. But it's good to think about this stuff!
---
I was trying to lead you there the other day:

Or it’s named for all the bugs..

Everybody with the scepter.
---
Everybody banging within the 10 hour.

I've played vanilla private servers for so long now that when I do from time to time play WOW I disable auto loot due to muscle memory holding shift while looting.
---
Critical strike gives crit chance on physical attacks and physical abilities(Aimed shot, multishot, sinister strike, execute etc).
---
Critical strike with spells gives crit chance to magical abilities (spells), like frostbolt, shadowbolt, mindblast, arcane shot etc.
---
if you bang with within 10 hours of the gong, you get the mount.
---
I THINK NOT
---
Why were Game Masters so chill back then while now they don't even interact with the community?
---
I honestly expected peon day to be the holiday "day of work" (Tag der Arbeit) in Germany on May 1st as peons are the worker class of the orcs.
---
I'm disappointed but at least I dont have to check my email every 5 mins now. 😋
---
&gt; he absolutely does not want to heal
---
Are you like.. sure of this?
---
Does he know how healing vs dps compares in vanilla, does he know that being a healer in raid doesn't stop him from getting sick elemental shaman gear? Does he know he can even play a healing spec that does amazing damage in pvp too? Does he know that healing is actually quite interesting and dpsing with as an enhancement or elemental is really stale?

Enhancement tank

it's just WoW but the Dark Portal doesn't reopen etc.
---
Alliance, for Escape Artist and Blessing of Salvation and Paladin's in general.
---
WotF is over hyped and easily countered and the Horde Towns are depressing to be in.
---
There is a /focus command if oyu have simply "Focus" vanilla addon :) works same as tbc+ focus frames.
---
Grabbed the .torrent file. Good work!
---
Honestly I would expect a lot shorter testing cycle for a game that was technically already finished 15 years ago. They won't even be trying to get rid of a lot of the bugs, just new ones that weren't in it originally. Basically they'll just test and make sure everyone can log in and play, and that nothing unexpected broke.
---
a) you lack a knowledge of "mouseover" target in macro
---
b) you do not use vanilla addons for focus and pvp it seems
---
c) profit for us who know &lt;3 
---
take it as a feedback man, there is a lot of good stuff for vanilla so same for classic out there!
---
Thx, that's what I thought
---
oops, sorry I dropped my massive *G O N G* 
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Warrior gang rise up
---
Yes - + healing, and + damage, as well as +damage and healing.
---
How classes are and behave changes with gear and upcoming phases. Compare the strength of a hunter and a warrior at level 35/tier 1 or equivalent gear /maxxed out vanilla gear.
---
As a former hunter I hated post bwl, because I felt getting weaker and weaker. I'd really like to relive the beginning as hunter and early raiding. But I fear the end so now don't know what to play myself.
---
this is the very issue I'm facing
---
why the hell would it be mandatory?
---
Every time I read "enhancement" I feel great relief.
---
All the people calling it "Enchantment Shaman" need a slap to their face.
---
yeah true that. Doubt anyone would drop double the sub fee when you can go play it on very populated pservers for free.
---
Simply saying they probably have bigger issues to think about. You know, like trying to actually get the game ready for us in time.
---
Datamining is cool, bravo on whoever it is trying to get us information but it's not on blizzard in this situation to cater to people doing that with statements etc. Bravo that they even did, and in such a short amount of time after the leaks.
---
I wish that were the case - the other responses here seem to point out what I so blithely wished to ignore... the chances of this happening are incredibly low 😔
---
Another good point. Thanks for bringing that up!
---
Hacking contributes to the inflation on a realm due to the account being restored and everything that was taken has been put back into the economy effectively doubling the gold and items of one player
---
Multiply this by thousands and thousands for all realms and you have a big spike in the economy 
---
For this reason I would like 2 step verification to be mandatory for all accounts in Classic
---
Retail WoW isn't an RPG.  It's a dress-up and mount collection simulator.  At best it's an MMORNG.
---
Most likely it will be limited to 1 per realm due to the intense grind that comes with it not many people will do it
---
Maybe some realms might agree to a specific date so multiple people can get it but I don't think it will be very common
---
Still sounds like a pretty logical guess - but I certainly have no idea what I’m talking about, either, so...
---
Yeah the fantasy feel to the Vanilla sets is amazing really.
---

---
Hasn't been that for a very long time.  MMORNG.

OG Loch is the coziest place in all of Azeroth

Where I'm from, August is the last month technically in summer.

Playing an actual RPG rather than a dress-up and mount collection simulator.

Not having M+ or any other system where there is 50 different versions of the same raid and dungeon.

---
\*Laughs in Warlock 1v1 OPness.\*
---
I miss the community of the older games, today its just join a que, random people join and then you never interact everything is handed to you on a platter.
---
Different level rank spells, realistic damage numbers, no flying mounts, slow challenging content.
---
Bruh, it's named after the Silithids that inhabit the entirety of that zone.
---
Would Tauren Druid alt be useful for herb picking &amp; transmute to supplement a Warrior main who gets BS&amp;Mining (assuming that Engineering is not too important as fury Mainspec). Or am I better off making a goldfarming alt such as mage or hunter if they keep solo tribute? I probably have time to level all three for reasons..
---
Making it mandatory is maybe a bit far fetched but it's a good idea anyway to have 2SV.
---
Ugh. ST could be miserable.
---
Well I hope your main class / it's pvp spec can farm gold for consumables
---
Nothing like a good cock tease on a Friday night though; that's what my mom says anyways.
---
...as long as it mostly stays on the forums
---
This is the only reason I would support the idea of RP-PvP realms
---
Warlocks are mushrooms ;)
---
But 9/10 if not worse of the feral druids tries to get a hot off. Die because of it. 
---
Warlock got a lot of tricks but vs a ud rouge your dead.  
---
You fear(10s). WoTF out of it 
---
You fear again (5s deminish) trinket out of it 
---
You fear again congrats to a 2.5s long fear.  
---
And after that he is immune for 28s more then enough to kill you.  If you got succy out you might do it tho as the charm was on another timer.
---
played horde on private server so now i will go alliance for classic.
---
played a bit of both in vanilla but did majority of my raiding as alliance.
---
&gt; I will be tanking. I call the shots. I pull. I am responsible for the group. If anyone else pulls, I slow it down. Better slow than a corpse run/repair costs.
---
Got some IRL control issues, eh?
---
apparently there are multiple 10 min hearthstones, too.
---
unfortunately i'm not kidding.
---
Is Mikimao a refenerence to mickey mouse?
---
Well if I can handle getting to level 99 woodcutting on Runescape I can probably handle this.
---
Well now content creators can create another video "Beta confirmed - FALSE" video on top of the one they made before 😂
---
Yes, we will. Is this good or bad for you?
---
woosh, none of my posts are about serpent sting being good. Nice try troll :)
---
Yeah Blizzard could encourage people by giving some reward, for linking a 2SV device.
---
If they really wanna go aggressive they could give 30 minute headstart. :D
---
Should definitely be in. Holiday events were Awesome !
---
False/non-specific.
---
I'd love to, but the raiding times are a bit too late for me.
---
At first yes. Then it will drop off when people realize vanilla was easier mechanics but much more tedious to slog through. Then people will leave over being pigeonholed into certain roles because of poor initial class design. More will leave over elitists who want to min max to the nines and treat it like a job (even worse than retail). Yet more will leave over the likely hordes of griefers and e-thugs who want to "world PVP" when they really mean gank lowbies and stop people from playing (worse than retail).
---
Mage as main, Prot Warr als Twink. This was you will have Lots of fun leveling the twink with alchemy/cooking, no Stress and Go ham on min/max (if you Prefer that) on mage
---
Big expansive world that's CONNECTED and forces you to actually interact because your characters are too damn weak most of the time to do anything alone. Also the fact that there's no flying mounts and almost no loading screens means you really feel attached to the universe and other players inside of it. I'm also looking forward to rediscover the sense of adventure when going back to certain dungeons. I know it won't be the same and I really hope that I don't run into too many people who already scouted out everything and yell at me for not knowing exactly where to go within sunken temple.
---
It all depends on what you are farming! I mind running low level instances when I was 60 in Raid gear, and vendoring crap, selling the greens or sending them to an alt enchanter with disenchant then selling the enchanting mats. 
---
As a hunter farming the yetis In winter spring was easy, you could get 8-10 stacks of rugged leather an hour. I could make wicked leather bracers and headbands and then disenchant them selling the illusion dust on the AH for a fair amount! 
---
I always found this a faster farming method than DM runs.
---
The real gold comes from farming the AH and you can do that with any class.
---
American here ... not asleep.  About halfway through my night shift ...  Sounds fun, though I would prefer it to be worldwide at this point.
---
No. Maybe for a few days while retail folks check it out but not a chance in hell long term.
---
Tailoring and enchanting. Every time.
---
*Glares in paladin*
---
Your mom sounds cool can she be my mom?
---
Just play other class that you aren't sure about and other faction.
---
I still always remember the stolen silver quest from the barrens and how I had to kill a mob with evasion, die, rez, run back, kill other of three mobs, barely survive against the third, then loot the box of silver. Oh how I envied warlocks and hunters who could just run in while they sacrificed their pet.
---
People watch what they play, and a lot of people will be playing classic.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
This is 100% how ***I*** would do professions on a mage, and is therefore not necessarily my recommendation.  
---
**Alchemy:** I'd level an alt to 35 and put Alchemy on there.  
---
**Tailoring:** Required for Archmage and Bloodvine set bonus. I would keep this profession throughout the life of the game.  
---
**Enchanting:** I would not bother with this profession at any stage of the game. Instead I would get my enchants via the guild enchanter.  
---
**Skinning and Engineering, a conditional argument:**  
---
Will I focus heavily on PVP? If yes, I take engineering.  
---
Otherwise, will Dire Maul north AOE farming be possible when it is released? If yes AND PVP = no, I take skinning. If DMN and PVP = no, then I still take engineering for PVE and because I love engineering.
---
Pretty sure the large amount of information about ideal gold per hour farming spots will be more detrimental to economy prices.  Hopefully there will not be a hacking epidemic.
---
Even now in BFA wow has way more players than most games in the top viewed list on twitch, yet there's barely anyone watching. Watching someone wipe 100 times to a hard boss during progression raiding is not fun. Watching people buff a raid is not fun. Watching someone level is EXTRA boring and feels like a waste of time since you could be leveling your own character. Overall just not a game that lends itself to high viewership numbers. I'm CERTAIN that viewership will be massive for like a month or two, though.
---
Being an UD Rogue vs a good SL Lock just gives you a little hope the Warlock can crush. Orc pretty much has no chance.
---
Rogues were good in early Vanilla because they had strong gearing options, Onyxia and Ragnaros had very strong daggers and even Barman Shanker was strong before weapon speed was normalized (it had 2s swing), but up to AQ40 is when other classes got very strong as well and SL WL had an incredible amount of EHP, and by Naxxramas it got even worse. In early Vanilla it was pretty much whether the Rogue opened first, or the WL opened first with FH detection and a quick Death Coil or whether the WL can survive the opener with Succu charm. In late Vanilla it's just one sided towards the WL.
---
Rogues will dominate early classic, and WL/War will dominate late Classic.  
---
By the end of Vanilla WL was an exceptionally strong class and pretty much unmatched in 1v1 due to the control and EHP of the class.
---
Yes, I think it should be mandatory, but not for the reasons you're describing.  
---
Blizzard has a very well known goal of not offering the Classic population heavy GM support. Accounts that don't have 2FA are detrimental to that effort. Blizzard's goal would benefit from the stance on requiring 2FA.
---
Getting Alchemy on an alt is pretty neat. Do you happen to know if there are Recipes you CANNOT get with a 35 alt?
---
No thanks
---
Critical strike with spells should also include healing spells if I'm not mistaken.
---
They aren't releasing it in September. At least they shouldn't release it in September if they want a Classic Summer. No one thinks of September as summer. Kids have been in school for a month and a half, football has already started, Kroger has an entire aisle of pumpkin spice. Releasing it in September doesn't make it a Classic Summer since you'd play it for about a week or two before "official" fall.
---
Those shoulders have strength on them. Maybe I'm looking at the wrong item due to stat changes in the past, but strength and sub lvl 40 requirement means warrior/pally priority.
---
Mine wasn't a drop, it was a quest chain, but I kept the Paladin weapon Verigan's Fist for a long time.
---
You need to get a close friend, and take yourself to the top of a mountain and have them bury you in snow, so you enter a cryonic suspension. Then when classic wow is released, your friend will come and find you and thaw you out ready to grind dat 60
---
I don't know, but the only ones I'm interested in recipes that support raiding and PVP, and I believe you can get all of those on the alt.  
---
You can level that alt as a warlock too and it can double as a summoning character. You can also level tailoring on that alt and make mooncloth + alchemy's arcanite bar on cooldown.
---
This also counts for rogues with an increase in the Eviscerate rank. Sudden explosive damage increase!
---
%80 of that gear not in game at launch fyi
---
What do you mean technically or otherwise? Fall begins on Sept. 21.
---
Dont blame classic, if BFA wasnt shit it wouldnt die
---
It should be optional. However gold you lost from hackers shouldnt be returned when you don’t have the verification on. I’m for it either way.
---
True.
---
Look up elemental sham build, ele tree with natures swiftness I'm guessing. Missing too many healing talents to heal progression I think. Cant keep up with other caster dps cuz no warlock curse boosts ele dmg/ lowers ele resistance. Any fight longer than 60 seconds you oom.
---
how did it not work in practice, you can actually finish a zone now without being 5 levels over leveled. It achieved exactly what it intended too. 
---
Now you can actually do dungeons without spending 80% of your time walking to a level appropriate zone.
---
If you think scaling didn't work you clearly can't critically think very well.
---
Thank you for the feedback, stay tuned.
---
Same way you buy any big ticket item IRL.  You save rather than spend, for a length of time, or you borrow money from somebody.
---
My hype is slowly dying if I'm honest. I want it to be ready but I also am feeling like summer means December. I'm exhausted clapping for blue posts that are basically, "yeah its totally playable just not for you, also we can't give any more information".
---
The Americans are alsleep, LOL. I can’t remember that but it sounds awesome to have. For Americans as well. Doesn’t make sense not to include it for them.
---
Enhance with improved wf totem. I'd imagine a lot of guilds will consider accepting 1 enh to put with the meeles. Get a nightfall too. Ele might work with very specific situations and trinket that reduces enemy spell resistance but that would b something he tests after progression, after he has very good ele set.
---
Technically summer doesn't start for another two months so we have an overall runway of 5 months we're working with, folks. Game could come out September 19 and still be considered a summer release. I truly don't think that will be the case, but you have to manage expectations.
---
What about wands?
---
If you're talking about splitting the year into months then:
---
The Meteorological seasons are defined as spring (March, April, May), summer (June,  July, August), autumn (September, October, November) and winter  (December, January, February).   
---
I guess this is regional thing. I just found out The USA has hard coded dates that are the astronomical autumn -ish.
---
Technically anything before September 21st is still summer
---
Pry the highest damage dealer in the raid if you consider the melee and spell caster damage boost values added to their enh dps.
---
Drama is pretty funny and the people who are bad team mates / ninja looters will quickly become apparent and known about. 
---
Back in TBC my guild was furthest ahead in progression and there was this Warlock who used to constantly spam our members offering thousands of gold to give up our raid spot to him and let him get better gear. Personally I used to tell him just do it with your own guild or apply somewhere that is recruiting Warlocks.. thing is this guy didn't enchant any of his gear, used the common crappy gems on his items.. I told him maybe some guild will be more interested in recruiting you if you show you are more prepared and make more effort to be the best you can be, he never listened and just told me he was waiting for upgrades to do it. :(
---
I felt kinda bad for him because being the first people to set foot in Hyjal / BT, to kill KT and Vashj.. that was fucking epic and I felt sorry for people who didn't get to experience that but I guess his motivations weren't in the right place.
---
Got it. And I agree that a September release wouldn’t be in the spirit of a Classic summer, but it would technically be fair.
---
Yes it does
---
It would be great to see Classic be a big success, but for the people that actually want to play Classic, all you need is a few full realms in each region to enjoy it. Enough people to have a real community and active servers that feel alive.
---
I can't wait to be FC in AV.
---
Wands for some reason scale with physical attributes.
---
Yup, beta isn't about testing, it's about generating hype.
---
Yeah, I was wrong. I hadn't come across astronomical autumn untill today, you live and learn!
---
There's a big difference though between playing around on a private server with a temporary test character you have no real investment in, and the real deal.
---
MadsSeasonShow is my favorite,  followed by Frostadamus. I loathe being yelled at by Twitch streamers like a shitty car salesman would, so these two have more knowledge than volume.
---
Your jobs still flag duties, only difference is you in stealth, in the enemy base, killing NPCs to cap it.
---
Good sarcasm though, I'll give ya a 3/10!
---
They have moved this thread, Apparently it belongs on "Looking for Group Monday" thread. We have other players that also do not use FB.  Posting on YT, also not a problem.  It sounds like you would be a good fit and I would like to stay in touch. you can reach me at drake.cad@gmail.com - If you drop me a quick note I will get in touch with you again when the game drops. Thanks for the interest.
---
With the abundance of quality free to play games out there with the current loot-box dominated mindset, I don't imagine that Classic will make a tend in the current gaming trends.
---
Never thought of it that way... Imagine if all the WF Procs and Bonus damage was added to their meter instead!
---
For the warchief makes no sense though. That isn't how thrall made the horde to be.
---
They are the horde, all equal and welcome. They're not there for the warchief, or to serve the warchief.
---
&gt;Alliance get more power out of +STR and +AGI things
---
Can you explain this one? I can remember anything about this.
---
Everyone within 10 hours. 
---
There will definitely be more than 1 person per realm with the mount. On private servers you see quite a few people with it.
---
No.
---
what i got from it is, basically: 
---
don't be so hopeful it comes out soon guys, you are wrong, its not that soon. we still developing it, its still work in progress, its just some alpha build to test the battlenet app.
---
~
---
Th launch seem more like august now in my eyes.
---
It's most likely a employees + friends and families alpha/beta. This has been common in the past.
---
Once it's ready and they decide to make it public invites will go out to alpha (just like WoD, Legion and bfa alphas) starting with some content creators (not sure if they have priority but in the past it seemed like every single streamer was invited public alpha day 1 which seemed unlikely to be random). Then the transition from alpha to beta to happens later and more and more invites go out to people who have opted into betas on bnet.
---
Zones will scale up but not down. So if you go into a level 70 zone as a level 50 you will still get one shotted. 
---
But if you go to a level 20 zone as a level 40, all the mobs will scale up to level 40. 
---
It means that you can play wherever you like, while still being more of a challenge.

---
Sounds great to me. PVP or RP-PVP if it comes out?
---
Remember that in vanilla strength increased your weapon damage so it was good for pretty much every melee class
---
Yeah but you know what they meant by that. It means that everyone will have the chance to play classic during the summer, not for one day of the summer.
---
True, although in organised pvp, alliance warlocks have paladin blessings, and horde warlocks get half their dots dispelled.
---
I feel the same. I sort of want off the hype train. Hope they dont kill the excitement by fucking around too long.
---
&gt; employees + friends and families alpha/beta
---
That's the first invite wave. More will follow... unless they don't. We know nothing. We know that alpha/beta will start. But that has nothing to do with us, if we won't be a part.
---
Cant kill that which is dead. Im my POV retail isnt a game anymore, but a monetisation platform designed to keep you mindlessly occupied and pay a subscription. There is a vast difference between a game you pay a subscription for and a subscription service pretending to be a game.
---
In terms of pure farming:
---
Hunter/Mage 80-90 GPH
---
Warlock: 70-80 GPH
---
Everyone else: 40-60 GPH.
---
Yep, amateur hour lol I was quickly glancing at it all. Just assumed I was a pro on the subject.
---
Damn bro you gotta do the New Balance like that .... Comfy as hell.
---
Well of the three melee classes that can even wear them, two of them are the warrior/paladin I already mentioned and then enhance shaman, who can only wear it past lvl 40. Seeing at it has a lvl 37 req I still argue that they're clearly warrior/paladin priority.
---
49 warrior for me, just like the old days :D
---
America is big as hell and many of us are awake. Also we wont have to discriminate as summer release will be 11:59:59 last day of summer. Get your fireworks half price. Also please dont riot.
---
I doubt itll only be 1. Bang a Gong! Cant be complete until the War Effort is complete, so itll be a race against that, not so much against other guilds.
---
Hence the IF
---
Reddit in general gets nasty with mass downvotes of things they don’t believe or understand
---
I also agree with this. No 2FA = no support.
---
Well it I hope so.
---
How long would it take to walk from stratholme to booty bay?
---
Just don’t bring hunter and pally/sham (unless they heal and agree not to roll on it)
---
The first thing i thought about hahhaaha TipsFail😂😂
---
That stupid 2x voidwalker bubble is absolutely broken in 1v1 lol
---
&gt; Also we wont have to discriminate as summer release will be 11:59:59 last day of summer
---
Yeah my thoughts exactly, there's a good chance the new Peon Day will just be the Classic worldwide release this time around
---
The sacred texts
---
I feel peedon already but nobody is selling me cheap fireworks.
---
It should not be enforced.
---
Business requirements are the only drivers that should mandate access controls like multifactor authentication. I can’t speak for any BIA that Blizzard has done, but the loss of a single public player account has no impact on the game’s stability or infrastructure. (A GM account maybe. Admin most definitely)
---
For that reason, driving all players into the inconvenience of multi-factor is detrimental, as there’s no benefit to the “cost” of enforcing 2FA. 
---
There is a difference between “recommended” and “required” though. Blizzard should certainly strongly urge players to use their 2FA service through a reward program or a dismissible dialog that trains users on how to secure their data.
---
Blizzard if you’re reading this...it’s me, your friend and family
---
Dungeon XP isn't fantastic but it would be worth doing at least once for the dungeon quests and possibly a couple more times if you really want pimp levelling gear.
---
As for mob tagging as far as I remember it does work and can net big XP but can be a bit sketchy with tos.
---
Blessing of Kings.
---
IIRC with mob tagging, whoever gets the first hit on the mob gets all of the xp/loot. Assuming you’re not in the same party, then it should be split? 
---
So I’d imagine a level 60 friend could kill all mobs for you if you tag them first? 
---
My memory is a bit hazy so correct me if I’m wrong
---
Most Americans are awake for work 
---
You lose
---
Oh man I hope you gave her an inkling that at some point in the future you will be expecting the favour returned...
---
More like half that since I would assume the OP would still have his own subscription.
---
Yes, you can't get several recipes coming from max level rep grinding like the Thorium Brotherhood, Zandalar Tribe, Cenarion circle etc. Pretty much all the rest can be learned at 35. These raid reps recipes can be handy, but most of the Alchemy money making comes from arcanite transmute, greater protection potions and the like anyway, so it's not that important for personal use. There will be somebody in your guild with these recipes if you need these consumes either way.
---
This was already posted not even a month ago.
---
A month is an eternity on this sub.
---
Good lord that guy has some ugly hearthstone thumbnails now
---
Wut? Peppers, onions, tomatoes, olives, sweetcorn, jalapenos, mushrooms.. these are the best pizza toppings by far cos they give it so much flavour. Not those horrible dry bits of processed meat that take about half a year to chew through.
---
That explains why by bank character is full of fireworks.
---
I was very confused about that.
---
Would be funny to celebrate the EU beta, although I don't think anyone remembers that day. I certainly don't.
---
My point is that it helps both, but it would help warrior more.
---
Classic doesn't really have a traditional gamedev cycle so this tells us nothing of the sort
---
Good, was I the only one that was anti-BETA? A very strict closed-BETA is literally the only thing I would be okay with personally.
---
A BETA works for new expansions because there's new stuff to test, usually things that has never existed before like new quest/class/skill mechanics and what not. Classic is already known and it doesn't need a large BETA testing to fix potential game breaking bugs, those major things(bugs/glitches) are already known by Blizzard. But again, I would be okay with a strict closed-BETA for Classic, but either a open BETA or a large closed-BETA would be bad for the game.
---
This post obviously doesn't mean there's still not time for a BETA and it might actually happen in a few weeks, time will tell.
---
Lake District or Cornwall. Or Centerparcs?
---
It's been a long time. But I'll never forget fighting off horde for an hour to get that goddamn chicken escort in Feralas, make it to the start of the hill and see the boat where the quest is complete... this undead Mage called Dave blinks, frostnova + AoE and fucked it all up!! Then at 60 I found him again and corpse camped him.
---
Out of your coup to plan a coup d'état?
---
It was never weapons. And remember that before WoW, 1 point of a stat mattered more. In ffxi there were boots that gave +3 Dex and +3 agi. They were the bis for classes/jobs that needed dex and agi for a solid ~50 levels. Also you have to keep in mind that leveling in ffxi was almost exclusively done in a group/party of 6 players. Having gear that lasted and was used in a group environment made it worth the effort to try and be the best you can be before endgame.
---
sl was undispellable by 1.12 I believe
---
Im using pfui atm, such a great addon.
---
Yeah, shaman as a class isn't built for dps raiding but here's your 3 best options I'd say:
---
1. Farm for nightfall to be the designated nightfall guy
---
2. Be a healer
---
3. Play a different class
---
It's not that you won't be able to finish the raid with a dude meme speccing it but you're gonna have people leave the guild if you do. People don't want to spend 15 hours a week farming pre bis, farming consumables, and farming gold for respec for them to play optimally. Just to carry a guy who feels like pushing the lightning bolt button in raids instead of the chain heal button
---
Eat this gnome.
---
I'm new to wow and I'm really excited to try it out mainly because I get to play it from the beginning rather than have the constant feeling that I'm a couple expansions too late. I'm also bringing along two friends who are in the same boat.
---
Fear, or "hey, I get a reason to pop Retaliation again!".
---
vuvuvuvuvu
---
aaaaaaa ruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun
---
Woah, made my head explode.  Now I can't unhear his voice.  I was watching unforgotten realms last month actually. Haha
---
True. But also horde has shaman purge. I still remember it to this day when our horde guilds clash with alliances in blackrock mountain going into mc. And our shamans started purge duty to remove all those world buffs.
---
God dammit now i want it to release even more😭😭😭😭
---
I've read that is actually the fastest method.
---
Sorry to break it to you, but it’s time to upgrade.
---
Pro tip, if you have pfui and go under the "bags and bank" settings tab, you can have pfui auto sell grey items
---
20 to 22 is to late for you?
---
Cotswolds
---
PvP server.
---
But on the upside: returning to lower level zones means you can gank the shit out of people. Also you get to do end game earlier.
---
Kurt Jennings?
---
But don't most Americans believe in the American Dream? To dream you have to be asleep. So...
---
Wondering if blizzard employees stopped working at all and only play classic since it dropped because it is that good :D
---
The Undead Skeletal Warhorse is still the best mount for me in game. In fact the white one from the Argent Tournament is my default go to mount, no matter what.
---
Sounds like you need to play Classic WoW when it's released this summer then!
---
Well in the beta data mine is a classic option for graphic. That might handle your PC :)
---
Hey man, similar situation except I've got a tight group of 3 guys all rolling out on launch day. Pm me if you're interested in leveling together!
---
Somewhere to be. I miss having an online game with a stable community where it's easy and viable to meet new people. I look forward to logging on to a game without a plan and knowing that I can easily end up doing anything with anyone. (And actually communicating with those people) You don't get that with a lot of games these days.
---
So much this. Logging in and recognising someone or being recognised it just isn't in the current retail game with all cross server and lfg crap.
---
It's the Vanquisher's Sword, quest reward

Oh on the first of May we had a different kind of holiday in vanilla. It was no GM day, because of strict workers protection rights in France on May 1st non of the EU GMs could work, all of the European support was based in France at that time if I remember correctly. So on May 1st we had no GMs, for several years if my memory is correct. It was great, once Kazakh was in SW he stayed there for the whole day :D
---
Long as they give me the option to stick to the old graphics, animations and all, I couldn't care less. I dislike how modern WoW looks. Contrary to what people are going to say, the new look isn't just the old one but improved. It's a different style. Significantly more cartoony in a bad (for me) way.
---
Losing all my friends... but making new ones... better ones...
---
Jokes aside. Big events like gurunashi arena with 20+ people going on for an hour. Guild vs. Guild fights in blackrock mountain. Farming honor for hours in Southshore Vs. Tarren Mill. 
---
But also twisting my brain about with proffessions to level on what alts. Where to farm the mats I need. Doing dungeons Ive never done before. Helping people that ask for help in general chat. Boosting some mates tru hard quests or dungeons. Watching netflix while mining for an hour. Premade BG with some guildies. Farming dungeons for pre-raid-bis stuff. Coming up with new shortcuts in dungeons by rushing and dying, and than soulstone and ress everyone. Leveling more alts. Fishing.. for hours.. cooking, just leveling everything. Working on reputations, farming runecloth for orgrimmar rep on my undead main so I look cool on a wolf.
---
But most inportand for me is raiding, already found a new guild. One in wich im already been talking for 4 months about this game. Taking daily with these people and theoriecrafting about the future. Rushing to 60 on my main and feel awesome. Be the player I look up to 15 years ago. After a year of playing maybe a guildmeeting ih Amsterdam. Meeting friends from online in real life. Have it be awkword for 30 minutes and after that be friends for life..
---
Really... Im looking forworth to this game so much.. Im going to enjoy everything.
---
If you can't run BfA anywhere in the world even at the lowest graphic settings you won't be able to run classic
---
You are abt to get Bbqsaucepwn'd with an attitude like that!
---
Every private server addon will be broken in classic.
---
It's because it's 22-24 for me.
---
LOL. That sounds fun like a fool's license (I just googled the word and am now one word richer).
---
Im sick of that response tbh. I cannot afford a new system nor do I need it.
---
The better spec for raiding is a different class. Shamans heal.
---
It's not the engine that's too taxing for your PC. The engine handles things like lighting and all the technical aspects, but the biggest impact is gonna be high poly models and high res textures. The number of objects that need to be rendered like players in one area will fuck your day up too, but classics models and textures are really low end. The engine will only increase the minimum requirements marginally. Even if your computer can't handle maxed out, drop the graphics down to the "classic" setting and you shouldn't have any issues except maybe 40 man raids.
---
While I am disappointed to hear the beta isn't around the corner, I am really glad that the Classic team is communicating unlike the Retail guys. 
---
One thing to keep in mind is that even though it's a Friend's and Family Alpha, Blizzard does invite randoms to the closed Alphas that happen afterwards. It happened with BFA to a lot of people, even people not involved in the social media community.
---
I feel that most of the time is being spent restoring the world and back end stuff. All that can be fixed in an alpha, which would lead to a longer run, and you can have a shorter beta where everything can be play tested. It's not like any of this content is new. 
---
I still have my fingers crossed for an end of July release.
---
High populated places in bfa and raids leave me at 12-15 fps. Rest around 50-60 fps.
---
I totally agree. People shouldn't be spoiling themselves and killing off the hype before launch.
---
&gt; nor do I need it.
---
Obviously you do...
---
&gt; If you are starting at launch with the crowd, then no profession is worth leveling with. 
---
Linen bags and lesser magic wands.  You'll have your mount money before you're 20.
---
Where is this from!!
---
Mob tagging is a fast way to level if you do it with a guy that knows exactly how it works and is a quick in the head. Mob tagging is pretty much just you damaging mobs while your booster is not in the same group, he then kills the mob for you and you get all the experience from the mob (it doesn't split amongst the group because the booster is not in the group).
---
1. You're in the same group
---
2. The booster leaves the party before the pull
---
3. You damage the mobs
---
4. He kills them
---
5. Re-invite him to the group
---
I have watched several people do this both from my old guilds and on streams.. and I have to say that a majority are very slow/bad when it comes to mob tagging which makes it not worth it at all if your goal is to level up as fast as possible. You should also keybind invite/kick and try to imprint it in your brain so you always remember to invite and kick as quick as possible.
---
On the topic of getting boosted casually though, it's not effective at all... you can easily out-level a guy getting boosted by a 60 just by doing quests. Getting boosted is usually just done for the sake of doing a dungeon for quests, items or simply just want to gain a level because you somehow got behind in the zones you were questing in.
---
Want off? You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.
---
Dude I hear you. I REALLY am considering healing but this whole nonsense of farm specs and the insane respec costs in vanilla and I just keep going back to the same question, why not just play rogue or mage? My alt in TBC was a resto druid and I loved the hell out of that, but at least back then hybrid classes were SIGNIFICANTLY better/stronger than in vanilla. I was a rogue in vanilla and pretty much used the same spec for everything. I was a raider in a successful guild so my gear allowed me to just 2 shot enemies with my pve spec so I never bothered to switch.
---
Mob tagging, is where you attack all mobs....like 1 hit on each, be it aoe or whatever....then someone else (ie a higher level player) nukes then down. You get all the do as you tagged them. 
---
For boosting lowbies, I used to have two accounts purely for this. I’d get my other account to level 55-60 and I could then run my alts on my main account, through lowbie instances for xp and gear. You get great xp and can do it with lots of instance quests also. And it should get you good gear to DE or vendor or sell on the AH for the loot u don’t need.
---
If it is as me I would wait until you engage mobs and end you painlessly.
---
r/whoooosh material right here
---
Enjoy 20fps then
---
Sorry, typo. Summer 2029.
---
Runs csgo, lol, hots and several other games at 60fps. I can live without wow then. Playing the private servers is fine
---
I remember being like 16 in wotlk, getting my first epic in a heroic and being upset. It felt so cheap. 
---
Especially after all the hard work I put in during vanilla and bc.
---
Lfg and gear score was the beginning of the end for me.
---
I played expansions after but that's when the greatest game ever made died.
---
Now it is finally ressurected.
---
Lok'tar Ogar
---
Thank you for a useful reply dude.
---
If it is me, I'd have a pocket healer keeping me topped.
---
I'll just ruin my 40s like I did my 20s then 😆
---
Baiting people for the enchanting trap, works every time xd
---
I don’t know you guys, but since I started playing in wotlk ppl been saying is dying and that is etc. I think some of the changes been pretty good, yeah sure some aren’t but the game still pretty good, best mmo out there by far. 
---
I don’t know when is gonna die, but it will be a long time, now with classic coming things are gonna get more interesting.
---
I for one will continue playing, classic or not classic and stop when there is no more game.
---
why is he posting a blue text so early in the morning instead of sleeping?
---
Telling you from experience, trying to make friends outside game to play with rarely ever ends up going anywhere. This is more true considering classic won't be out for another 2-5 months. Better off hopping on the game, you'll end up meeting people eventually. In fact you kinda have to lol. The huge majority of my friends quit playing over the years 2 of them play it regularly. None that I know of have a desire or even know about Classic. I too will be going in solo, WoW on its own is such an amazing game you'll probably hardly even feel alone. One of the nice parts about gaming is the ability to completely forget about everything outside the game.
---
I didn't downvote but the recent portal removal drama would tend to show that the black hole hearthstone replacement won't happen anytime soon. 
---
Also, the profession idea (if they left the skill points) isn't inherently bad. FFXIV has awesome professions and your character can learn them all - although not account wide.
---
Okay you don’t HAVE to upgrade but to be satisfied with the game you’ll want to upgrade.
---
You computer MIGHT be totally fine in classic mode but there’s a chance it won’t be and that would suck if you get let down that way. 
---
Don’t be sick of the only response people can give.  It sucks to hear it but that doesn’t change your situation. No one can be realistic for you.
---
Ive played numerous vanilla servers and wotlk servers in 40 raids and 25 raids. No problem. 
---
The problem is the updating graphics which I cannot follow. Its fine that it is, just not needed imo.
---
No, I did every quest including dungeon chains and ended at roughly 58 and a half with molten core atunement as my last quest.
---
No need to be defensive, it’ll make you appear less appealing to work with as it shows red flags. 
---
I get it though, you got some ideas, can produce creativity. But you need a person who can fix coding for you. Usually you would have a good shot if you looked over at one of the subreddits for a coding language. Plenty of new inspired and motivated people would appreciate your project.
---
Those changes happened in cata
---
You must grind some levels. That was their intention to get you into the world.
---
I usually get to around 225 or so and enjoy world pvp with iron nades, net, charge helmet etc :D
---
Because without those changes the world was even more empty.
---
Good one, but low effort
---
only if you break your arms
---
Depends alot actualy, if youre farming soul shards in elwryn forest my guess is over 9000..
---
the biggest JUST of them all
---
Same! Was actually considering trying to find a guild of 'old guard' players ahead of time, to find some like minded souls with similar playtimes. Will be good to share old stories and benefit from our collective (and dusty) knowledge of vanilla.
---
Good blues were useful for 5+ levels at least in Vanilla, and at 40 Warrior/Paladin would go on to plate anyway. 
---
Shaman, Paladin, and Warrior equally good reason to get them. A hunter has essentially no reason to get them as any level 40 mail with Agi/AP would be better, and those were common.
---
Get yourself together, regardless of how great vanilla wow is, it's still a game.
---
As Classic WoW will run on a modified version of current WoW, nothing from 1.12.1 would work right now. Same for any BfA addons. You’ll have to wait for people to have access to the game (beta/live) before they can start developing addons. So for now wait and see, as beta comes out keep an eye out for developers and addon sites to see how the scene builds up.
---
All I’m saying is that’s hard to believe it’s been like that since vanilla. I would love to logon to that server and see the chicken for myself. But again that doesn’t prove that they have been a chicken for 10 years or so. 
---
I really want to believe... but there’s not enough evidence so far.
---
Just saying, if a shaman took that over me as a warrior when we were below lvl 40 I'd be calling them a ninja. Common courtesy is to only roll need if the item is an upgrade for your main spec and you can immediately equip it.
---
Don't even have to buy a month! 
---
Support gave me three days to "check out my characters" :)
---
My stinky little gnome is going to put your human wannabe to final sleep! :D
---
Because leveling is so fast nowadays (as you have to level through multiple expansions worth of content) they made zones scale up to the max level of the expansion it's part of. This way people get the chance to finish the story in said zone without outleveling it after only doing half of it and feeling like they have to move on.
---
She was fine because of the severance package. He got back to work because the severance package dried out.
---
I'm not sure if this would work but I've an idea..
---
In SM for example. A low level mage wants to get boosted by a high level. They are in party. They high level would pull the entire dungeon and moves to the entrance. They will leave party now and have 1 minute before the high level gets teleported out. The  low level will blizzard all mobs to hit then once or twice. Tagging all mobs. Than the high level will spam some strong aoe to take all aggro and finnish then off.
---
Would this work? If not, why not?
---
It's not just convenience to the devs.
---
Retail WoW has a huge problem. We're in the *seventh* expansion now. Levelling new characters at the original pace through all of that would take ages, so they decided to cut down heavily on XP needed for old content. That however means you couldn't finish any old zone's quest without outlevelling them.
---
Also the scaling in Legion / BfA allowed for players to tackle the zones in any order which is nice, I guess.
---
I still don't like it but it's not just lazyness.
---
I think t1 looks much better 
---
dont like t2
---
Auto-scaling is fucking stupid and has no place in an MMORPG.
---
Why is alchemy the best profession for money making? Are you saying making pots and flasks from bought herbs is the best money per hour? Even more than doing actual grinding out in the wild somewhere?
---
But what if you do drugs and play WoW?
---
I agree i say go just for 2 days of stress testing

Sell gold in WoW to pay for your drug habit, duh!
---
This.
---
its extremely efficient if you know how to do it correctly. Recently saw a post with a guy getting lvl 35 in 5 hours and 39 min with boosting in a dungeon.
---
I WoW now?
---
Oh I see. Unfortunately they werent able to recall the old data. They had to work backwards from legion client. It’s classic and it’ll be around for a while. You can probably play sustainably to get 60 and enjoy yourself. Maybe you’ll eventually want to upgrade when you can.
---
I understood that reference.
---
if there gonna be beta, we gonna see a ton of addons at launch. i think most legion addons would be quite easy to adapt to classic. cos classic wow has a legion core. 
---
private server addons, especially a complicated ones gonna be  much harder to adapt.
---
Takes a special type of person to recommend serpent sting and then think he's being trolled when corrected lol
---
Hey I hate to burst your bubble, but it's pretty unlikely that marketing has any control over what goes up on the CDN.
---
I wish halo mcc on pc came today. That would scratch the itch quite a bit.
---
As much as I hate store mounts and think they destroy the game, Blizzard is not "asking" you to buy them. 
---
Blame the people who buy them, they're the reason Blizz is putting mounts in the shop instead of the game
---
&gt; Now that makes it certain that they're for some reason integrating the Classic client with Battle.net app
---
The reason is that you need to have an active WoW subscription to play Classic and all that is managed by battle.net. And even if you didn't, battle.net is their distribution and account management platform so it would be crazy not to integrate it.
---
Rip :(, can't make it earlier for you, 2 hours early start most just come home from school or work :(
---
ok very cool thaks
---
Nowhere I'm afraid. Just something I made while un-patiently waiting for Classic. But would be cool to have some hard/low drop chance quest chain after endgame or something
---
The answer is just too subjective, but I'll give you my opinion...
---
If I liked mage, I would play one because they have so many things going for them that on paper look better than a hunter.  I've tried many times, and like you said, it feels a bit dull to me.  However, they have top end DPS, you don't have to respec from frost to PvP, they level well, they are the only class that can AOE grind, they have portals, they can make their own food and water, and can make a lot of gold selling that stuff.  In vanilla, travel time via portal is something that cannot be understated.  Their CC is the best in the game. There are always groups looking to bring in a mage, even PuG raids, probably not so many hunters except to tranq shot.
---
All of that being said - I prefer hunter myself and would take the downside because it's just more fun to me.   ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
classic wow = legion wow.
---
so you need to search for the legion minimal system requirement.
---
"As posted on Battle.net, the minimum requirement:
---
OS: Windows XP/Windows Vista/Windows 7/Windows 8/Windows 10 with latest service pack  
---
CPU: Intel Core 2 Duo E8500 or AMD Phenom II X3 720  
---
GPU: Nvidia GeForce GT 440 or AMD Radeon HD 5670 or Intel HD Graphics 5000  
---
RAM: 2 GB "
---
I really hope to god this isn’t a thing.
---
Earn your shit the way everyone else does. You want the gear, you put in the time and effort.
---
I know for a fact this happened with at least Benediction back in the day.  It's pretty natural for a guild with content on farm to take advantage of gear they don't need (say if all their priests were already geared in BWL and needed nothing from MC) and sell the drops.  In a 40man raid you have on farm you can drop plenty of raiders to let in people paying your guild bank for items.
---
Costs will vary a lot from server to server depending on what % of the server has content "finished" enough to start selling pieces... and the price of enchanting materials.
---
As another mentioned, I went back to work after the 6 months of severance pay ended. She was okay with this for a number of reasons. 
---
She didn't have to do chores around the house anymore because I took care of that.  But she still cooked a lot, she's a great cook and enjoys it.  So while I was in the depths of a WoW addiction, her life God a bit easier in that regard.
---
We are also a couple that values our private time.  She did a lot of reading during those months. She is also a WoW player and played a bit on the same server.  No raiding or anything hardcore though.
---
I tried to continue raiding after returning to work and only lasted a month before I ran out of steam and quit WoW altogether.  I'm sure others can pull it off, but I just couldn't manage full time employment with classic WoW raiding and the amount of farming that I had to do to play at the level that I enjoy. 
---
But what a great 6 months it was!
---
&gt; as there’s no benefit to the “cost” of enforcing 2FA.
---
The benefit is reduced man-hours spent by support retrieving stolen accounts.  Who knows how much that benefit is actually work but it's definitely there.
---
Killed turtles in Tanaris from 40 to 43 selling their drops. Finally bought my kodo after that
---
I remember this happening, I think it was in wotlk but not sure. Basically some guy accidentally got a GM tag which he thought was hilarious so he typed in trade chat 'I'LL BAN YOU ALL' with the GM tag visible. 
---
Then an actual GM came along and told us also in trade chat that they accidentally flagged his character as that, or something. 
---
Could've been EU Ravencrest or eu Outland.
---
I mean they could be lying to preserve the hype of an announcement. It would not be the first time a game company has done this.
---
Is your name Michael?
---
[This](https://www.lfg.co/page/1/) is the reason.
---
&gt; not offering the Classic population heavy GM support.
---
Your account is battle.net-wide, not just classic.  GM support for account theft only cares about overall player numbers, not whether they play classic or BFA or hearthstone.
---
idk man i work too much and so much does my brother. I figure once we get rank 10 pvp gear and some mc/ZG/AQ20 BIS, this may be an option to continue progressing.
---
Who cares tho? it's not like people will get full T3 BIS through this option.
---
i wouldn't be so sure, a big chance  they are only be disguised as lower end textures and model. to look old. but in reality process the same amount of info.
---
I think that they don't even know yet. They might have an idea but nothing concrete. They might just want to see where the player base is relative to the current content before deciding when the next phase should release.
---
&gt; GM's used to be able to go on racist rants and shit in the official blizzard forums and not even get repercussions. 
---
Annnd this is why classic needs to either have no report function or manual review because god knows "someone in barrens chat made an offensive joke that doesn't align with my radical progressive ideology, blizzard pls ban all these white nationalists playing your game!" is coming...followed by 20 retarded news articles by activist hacks calling themselves game journalists.
---
The flight paths were awesome. It felt so immersive when you could see other players fighting in zones as you flew overhead. Or saw enemies to gank when flying into a zone.
---
Just like the intro. That blew me away especially because there was tons of people fighting there when the camera flew overhead.
---
I've done the same, but by trying out FF online for a few days while I wait. I needed to get that binge out of my system
---
Hey. I sent you a paypal payment for an item in r/Gear4Sale but you haven't replied. 
---
I paid you but you ghosted on me after the payment. 
---
Can you please answer my PMs to you?
---
I feel ya. I did the same thing for my epic mount, except my long shark was a guild mate. He said that he would lend me the 600g I was asking for with 25% interest. No rush on getting it to him he wanted the whole thing at once. I learned how to actually make gold and paid him his 750g. I never took a loan again in this game, so it was a good learning experience.
---
[Some things never change though](https://i.imgur.com/G0StcRs.jpg)
---
Yes I get what you're saying and it's correct! So yes I would also expect rogues to have more benefits on horde than ally relative to warriors (where threat is the main limitation)
---
How did you guess? :P
---
dude if you work to much that you have to buy gear with gold #1. you wont have the time to farm the gold to buy the gear in the first place 2#. you won't make rank 10 hahahah
---
I don't know what WoW is like these days but like I said, this was in WotLK when WoW was a fun computer game.  To think that in this medium I have any responsibility to report a silly glitch like this is absurd. I spent 15 minutes enjoying a meaningless mishap and it was probably entertaining to all involved, even those that I killed in town, given how rare the situation was.  There was no griefing and folks were free to leave town to escape the wrath of the GM.
---
I highly doubt that any jimmies were rustled or anyone got fired for it.  I had a short chat with the GM that contacted me and they have no indication of it being anything but an "oops" situation. Saying that the GM was "probably fired" is ridiculous!  You must be a serious industry insider to make such a claim.
---
I'm going to stay optimistic. What I hope for is that they skip a beta entirely and works towards a release as soon as possible instead. Betas in my eyes have always killed the hype severely
---
rank 10 is possible with some hardcore weekend farms a few times, i've done it before.
---
and you earn gold over time.....
---
Can i find this epidsode on the apple podcast app?
---
same here there is software that can reduce your ping, pick a west coast server, etc. google around a bit there are a lot of ways to improve your ping but i'm assuming it will still be around ~150 at the lowest
---
Freaking carebears, right?
---
You have enough time to raid lol
---
Just finished the War2 human campaign today. It was **much much** easier than I remember it from back in the day. Then again, I did play War3 competitively and am not 14 anymore.
---
That's not how it works. A texture 512x512 in size is smaller in size than a texture at 2048x2048. There's nothing to "disguise". A lower resolution texture is a lower resolution texture. Same with models. A lower poly count is a lower poly count. Both instances there's less data to handle.
---
What IS more taxing will be the rendering pipeline, shadows, lighting, etc. The rendering pipeline will be more expensive in today's engine than in 2004 using the same low resolution art, models, audio.
---
I can go into more detail if you want but this is a rudimentary example.
---
Yeah except the playerbase has tanked in numbers so much its hilarious. Sure none of these ever killed it, WoW will kill it self, but they did hurt it and they did hurt it a lot.
---
I've talked about how terrible scaling is with lots of friends and other players. I lean towards small use of a scaling mechanic for a good experience. I really liked that legion allowed for you to choose the zone you level in. It also worked out because you were gaining levels and artifact talents (i.e. getting stronger). It felt like ass to level in BFA because you got nothing and lost your legendaries after 115. 
---
I'm a firm believer that item level scaling and pvp scaling (in combination with wf/tf) have ruined retail. I look forward to a consistent game where if i do 600 damage, my opponent saw the same number on his screen as life lost.
---
I hope they go to BC but get rid of flying and then go to Wotlk and get rid of flying and just stop. Or at least give us a choice to stop at classic, BC and Wotlk if we want to.
---
I think that flat tipped sword was called Bloodrazor
---
Exploiting the bug to get some in game advantage would have been an issue.  I used it for 15 minutes of fun in an Alliance town. The people downvoting for this are really lame.
---
Well, he knew as much as all of us, can't really blame him
---
Blizzard won't release content at times that conflict with other content releases of their games. They also usually release WoW related content at the same time a FFXIV expansion launches.
---
FFXIV Shadowbringers launches officially on the 2nd July 2019. 
---
Several streamers and content creators who went to the WoW summit(Taliesin&amp;Evitel, Sloot, Justwait(maintank in Method) and several more) saw the features of 8.2 and at the very least Sloot assumes they will release 8.2 at around June. Blizzard also said they will release the next raid tier, the Azshara raid, a few weeks later.
---
Blizzard also repeatedly said it will be a Classic summer. 8.2 hit the PTR last week as well.
---
Let's assume raid testing starts in the next 3 weeks on the PTR.
---
8.2 will most likely launch early June, probably on the 4th or the 11th. "Few weeks later" usually means two to four weeks later and several other patches have shown that to be the case. That means the Azshara raid will probably launch either on the 25th of June or the **2nd of July**, the official release of the Shadowbringers FFXIV expansion. Ideally it would be the 25th as the mythic difficulty and the world first race would then start on the 2nd, which is a lot of publicity for Blizzard and the raiders that now stream the race. 
---
Assuming the race lasts one raid ID it would end up beeing a two weeks of leeway for Blizzard to then release Classic on July 16th without conflicting with other WoW related shedules. Maybe a week later - anyways it would still be a classic summer as a lot of people take off their time in August and school holidays as well as lecture-free periods usually are at around that time until even september.
---
tl,dr: A July 16th launch is most likely. Maybe even a July 23rd launch.
---
Not on Saturday
---
Do they still do Children's Week? And what patch did that event start originally
---
The sense of community, everyone who played vanilla in a good guild remembers the moments with the ppl not the bosses.
---
Retail versions just got more and more non personal, anonymous, cant wait to be part of an actual living server again.
---
Guys, there‘s no worrying that...
---
I didn‘t stop playing on privates and the hype is just growing bigger each day.
---
Killing off the classic hype seems... impossible.
---
Lets say a level 36 and a level 37 Warrior are in the group. Both roll need, now the l36 Warrior is a ninja to you?
---
You have a very odd view on what "need" is that most people don't share with you. 
---
To be quite frank, a Warrior needing on a Mail item when close to 40 is almost ninjaing itself. You'll soon have plate options whereas the Shaman has *that one shoulder*. Common courtesy is to let the person who actually needs to item have it, i.e. the Shaman.
---
I dont know where this guide comes from, but raid gearing wise this one is *terrible.*
---
The only point of bringing a shaman is nightfall. For nightfall uptime you need to crit, because when you crit you get flurry and more swings in increasing the chance of hitting the mob.
---
Stacking +sp is just terrible, your DPS will be marginally better, but now not only warriors and rogues are pissed because you steal melee loot, now casters are pissed, because you dont give a fuck about nightfall uptime.
---
Also this guide comes from a crappy private server which did not reset the swingtimer after a cast. So you could weave casts into your swings, which is not how it worked in the actual game.
---
It is not laziness, more that they don't want to spend dev time working on the old content. Which is understandable. But the proper solution would be to rework those zones in a way that you don't outlevel it by the time you finish the storyline. That takes way more time than implementing scaling. Again I don't expect them to do that, probably they would have had to design the zones (back in Cata) taking future expansions and XP rescales into account, basically in a way that adapting it later on is easy. But it is too late now, so we are stuck with scaling.
---
Yes, peons. Converse amgonst yourselves whilst we slumber.
---
It's built on whatever the current engine is built with. It started back in legion, sure. Any updates will be in classic. Think of it like multiple games made with UE4 or Unity. They can use the same build but be different games.
---
It's the most cost effective option to ensure compatibility in the future, security, etc. They aren't just keeping it at the legion engine build.
---
Don't confuse a content patch with source patch. Whenever the engine updates for bugs, rendering issues, performance, classic will be updated, as well. There's no need to manage multiple forks of a source.
---
O fuk that some Aristotle shit.
---
What if... what if “Classic summer” just meant they were *developing it* over the summer.... and not the release. What if we’re still 6+ months away?
---
Except for Feathermoon, not much.
---
The upper one has a surprisingly big N.E town with a few quests and one decent grinding zone if you like peace and quiet.
---
The lower one has 1 questing zone Nagas on its northern tip that interestingly enough features a unique design cave. Rest of the island is made up of 60+ mobs, only of niche interest for some crafting and AQ access quest.
---
&gt; “Classic summer” just meant they were developing it over the summer
---
then the post "get ready for a classic summer" would appear on their internal dev forum
---
Ysosrs?
---
Your quality is much better than my old vanilla Disc PVP video, enjoyed it m8, its gonna be good to come back.
---
Personal question as i was NE, did you use Feedback a lot vs other casters?
---
Prot warrior FTW IMO.
---
Thanks for clarifying. This is what I was trying to say.
---
Like I said on another post... what it “Classic summer” meant that they were *developing it* over the summer, not that it would be released then. What if we’re still 6+ months away?
---
Gatekeepers gotta gatekeep, ya know.
---
It will, in fact one of the best blue trinkets for healers was this: 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=19990
---
hit the gym. get in shape so you dont have to move when its released.
---
To me yes the 36 should cede the item unless he would ding 37 inside the instance. Otherwise you can't prove that it wasn't simply a greed roll. 
---
\&gt;  To be quite frank, a Warrior needing on a Mail item when close to 40 is almost ninjaing itself. 
---
Nope. 3 levels takes long enough in vanilla and the warrior at the time could wear it and it's for main spec. 
---
\&gt;  Common courtesy is to let the person who actually needs the item have it, i.e. the Shaman. 
---
If you want to play THAT game, the warrior scales better with gear so they in fact need it more.
---
ask tough questions get tough answers;)
---
The best answer.
---
Keep in mind they might not treat this alpha as an alpha. There may not even be a beta between alpha and launch.
---
See? There is something good about modern wow lol
---
Lawls someone actually downvoted you. Back up with ya bro.
---
Yeah Nvidia Shadowplay does all the work in the quality department lol. I love feedback against mages who blink in to AOE spam, they often really hurt themselves. It's not too useful other thah thay though because it's a 3 minute CD. In my opinion the best pvp race I've played is night elf. Star shards is so underrated.  Everyone kicks it, especially rogues becauase it channels through line of sight when they're trying to vanish, and it gives me so much room to free heal. Dwarf is realistically probably the best though, stoneform for viper sting and blind and of course fear ward. I usually forget to use desperate prayer lol. I do like the 10% spirit for humans though, especially considering the r13 gear for priests has 0 spirit.
---
You needed elemental resist for some fights, the giant wasp in aq40, most firebosses in mc, some in bwl, the undead dragon in naxx.
---
My first char was a warr. My friends made me switch because One of them already was a warr. I was a bit behind as they all played the beta and started right at launch whereas I was about a few weeks late to the game. So my first few hours were me running a night elf warr to sw only to make a new mage before I got to level 10. At least I learned how to corpse run right off the bat.
---
I could see the use in doing that, but there's definitely a case for staying ahead of the pack instead of sitting around trying to farm gold at launch. There will be much better farms available if you're one of the first few to 60 and affording a rare mount shouldn't be an issue to begin with, especially on a class that has insane grinding capabilities and zero gold expenditure on food/water.
---
How can one be burnt out by Classic? you game bruh?
---
&gt; To me yes the 36 should cede the item unless he would ding 37 inside the instance. Otherwise you can't prove that it wasn't simply a greed roll.
---
What kind of logic is this?   
---
SM equipment was Bind of Pickup, you can't prove whether or not it's a greed roll, you just have to have a tiny sliver of faith in people. Do you not?
---
&gt;Nope. 3 levels takes long enough in vanilla and the warrior at the time could wear it and it's for main spec.
---
Enhancement is a main spec, and was perfectly viable DPS (when taking support into account) in a low level dungeon.
---
&gt; If you want to play THAT game, the warrior scales better with gear so they in fact need it more.
---
This is turning into a childish pissing contest. Act like an adult.
---
I'm gonna fill all 5 profession slots early on, and skill all of them as I keep leveling. When I am max level, I will make sure all professions are at max skill, and eventually also getting all profession skill increasing items available to me. Fishing 352 without lures, baby!
---
I like not having to go back, and I also like learning recipes I find along the way, do profession quests, and being able to roll Need for recipes for my professions when inn dungeons. I think it's just neat, and I at least feel like it is also time saving to both level and skill up at the same time.
---
I can guarantee that there will be friction and resentment within the guild.
---
Why does he get Neltharions Tear when he never shows up in the DPS charts?
---
Why doesnt he have to respec like mages and warlocks when they want to PvP in the perfect cookie cutter spec?
---
These are quesions that pure clothis will ask when progression hits a wall like Nefarian or C'thun and concessions need to be made.
---
In a way its even less understandable, because shamans get great DPS gear from being resto.
---
Aurastone hammer, Lok'amir/Claw of Chromaggus, most of T2 pieces, ZHC, Natural Alignment Crystal, Zandalars Augur Hauberk etc. etc.
---
nochill
---
Did GMs watch when world first things where happening? Things like killing Thunderaan? 
---
I remember we had 2 raidsgroups when we summoned him in what I belive to be EU first summon. Just wondering if there might have been some hidden GMs running around there :)
---
Thanks for sharing all this, was fun reading about it.
---
Makes sense for SoC now since the proc is based on weapon damage, unlike other procs like Fiery enchant or procs on your weapon.
---
The edge case is interesting to look into, I might want to crunch those numbers. But even with the one you suggested, fast weapon is better to get your HS out quicker.
---
Assuming they just started their *alpha* at the end of April, and assuming they do a somewhat typical Blizzard testing schedule, it will be at *least* September before we have a release.
---
That beautiful moonwell though. As a Horde, perfect to piss in.
---
3 week Beta in June. Release July
---
There's no end? It either dies or turns into a TBC server. And don't think for a second you'll need to level a 60 to get onto a TBC server.
---
I dont know, the tail end was probably the best time I had in Wrath. Arthas is in many ways the true big bad of WoW even though there are more powerful entities than him. He and Illidan are well rounded characters that I actually felt with and they both were pretty menacing. I would say that classic, TBC and WoTLK were the best states of the game and imagine if they got rid of flying mounts on TBC and WoTLK. Instant 10/10.
---
Quick quest completion is huge when leveling. Getting a few items is a bonus. The person usually running people through will make a lil money just from loot.( I would take everything the lowbie didn’t “need”)
---
I agree with what you say regarding mob tagging.
---
Warrior attack:
---
Furious Blow
---
Rage cost: 5
---
Cooldown: 20 sec
---
Your next melee Attack generates twice as much rage. 
---
It wouldn’t be too great for PvE, but would help with initial aggro, but it’d be amazing for PvP because 2handers generate so much more rage per hit.
---
The people.
---
Off topic but it has been so long since I’ve played WoW and seeing the lingo, like you referring to characters as “toons”, makes my heart sing a song of joy.
---
For me, it's wanting something specific from that class. Chain heal on resto shaman or PvP burst of Ele shaman. Unkillable bubble hearth of paladin. Once I get it, too far invested to reroll.
---
You mean out of the cluck?
---
Gathering professions will be your bread and butter.
---
Mage with Enchanting and Tailoring is pretty efficient and lucrative (AOE kill/gather cloth/craft/disenchant/repeat) not to mention food/drink/portal/enchanting whoring in major cities.
---
It's a joke but I've done it. Lost a job and was working a shit part time as much as I could so I closed my internet. This was in TBC so wow was life. I found indeed an open wifi next door and moved my pc as close to the next house as I could.
---
I was a rest druid and healed the first boss of Black Temple with 400ms ping by keeping counts of lifebloom stacks in my head. That was peak performance.lol
---
You’re right! As of now I’m doing Hunter/Druid but we’ll see how long that lasts. Thanks!

Warhammer fantasy is definitely better than Warcraft's lore. I mean Warcraft was actually based on Warhammer before Game's Workshop decided they didn't want to Blizzard to make a game for them. Then Blizzard with ideas of Warhammer made Warcraft into what It is today.
---
Heh I was trying to glitch my self inside Dalaran arena in Wotlk but ended up getting my character stuck inside Dalaran so that I couldn't log in just instant DC everytime. So I had to contact a GM and tried to be as casual as I could hoping he/she would not notice WHY I was stuck.
---
The GM didn't notice or simply didn't care and just ported my character to Orgrimmar. Phew!
---
That would be for Heroic Strike, not Execute
---
Yeah I did that for the OG classic wow
---
Our guild declared war on a horde guild and was awarding dkp for screenshots of kills out in the world. So much fun.
---
This is the same reason I hate Oblivion but love Morrowind (and to an extent Skyrim)
---
The problem is that almost all classes have to respec from PvE to PvP in order to have fun.
---
Mages? Respec from 31/0/20, because arcane power is shit in PvP unless you only want to contribute every 3minutes, but its the goto cookie cutter spec for PvE.
---
Warrior? Have fun getting into a group as fury. You will have to respec to arms. Only in AQ40 gear or R13 + R14 weapons you will have enough brute force to actually do well in fury and you will still lack mortal strike, so no premade spot for you.
---
Rogue? LOL, combat swords in PvP. Among the worst specs you can PvP in.
---
etc.
---
Shamans are in the position that lots of their gear they acquire in raids is also applicable to PvP. From a post further up by me:  
---
Aurastone hammer, Lok'amir/Claw of Chromaggus, a fair amount of T1, most of T2 and all of t2.5 pieces, ZHC, Natural Alignment Crystal, Zandalars Augur Hauberk etc. etc. 
---
There really is no reason to not heal.
---
So they can get to max level before phase 2 comes out and the game turns into a pvp fuckfest lol.

Fuckin Dave’s man.

You're not a frustrated child *yet.*

Give it time, the PuGs will have us hating people in no time ;)
---
He's just slim enough that the clothing modelling industry would want to hire him though.
---
Or things they don't want to happen
---
As for whether you need it? Not really, the game was never designed with people watching their threat via threatmeters and having stuff like Healbot and Decursive. This is all stuff that can be done by just playing the game as intended. But it's hard to convey how "threat" works to those that aren't aware of it ("You do lots of damage, so the enemy thinks you are the highest *threat*").
---
Do they help? Obviously. It's up to you whether you want to use them. I'm definatly using custom unitframes, since the standard UI looks dogshit.

I bet she tastes like Jolly Ranchers too

First character in WoW was gnome warlock, who I got to 60 and cleared BWL with prior to TBC. There are two things I remember from leveling at that time. Not having enough quests and running all over the place trying to hit 60, and discovering the Lighthouse in Westfall. My bedroom at that time had lighthouse decorations. Not sure if that is why I thought it was cool, but it has stuck with me.
---
Yea i did enjoy being able to shadowmeld and drink/heal up with renew in peace in between pvp fights. Also i remember defending flags in AB vs rogues that would just go "wtf what is this starshards on me??" while i was giggling from a bush :P
---
Im going to roll a Human priest though now in Classic this time cuz of my m8s but just wondered how it was like in pvp back then.
---
My proudest moment back then in pvp was being invited to a R14 WSG group (i was "just" R10), and we just facerolled the opposing team, good memories :)
---
I actually hope there is no public beta.
---
It would kill a lot of the magic.
---
That's mob tagging :)
---
I still have arrows on one of my toons in retail.
---
You do NOT run Hots at 60FPS. That is a lie. If you can do that, you can run WoW at lowest graphics at 60FPS for sure
---
There's a big difference between the loot system of classic and retail which means that it won't be as prevalent as in retail.  
---
In retail you get roughly x3 the loot for 25 man as you do for 40 man in classic, not even mentioning coins. Furthermore this gear can titanforge meaning that "normal" drops are less desirable for raiders. 
---
In Classic each boss drops around \~10 pieces of loot. Of these maybe 3 are Bis, 3 are usefull and 4 are complete trash. 
---
It'll therefore take much longer for guilds to actually get the BIS that they want.
---
On LB my guild did sell raid gear, but it was obviously only the gear that no raider needed. During BWL you'd be able to buy deathbringer for around 2.000 g, but again the chance of that dropping is low. Sometimes low enough that it's not even worth the effort of making sure you're where you need to be at the right time with the right attunements.   
---
If you'd want ashkandi, you'd probably have to get in line behind warriors, hunters and paladin that pvp in the guild of your choosing. I'd expect the price if you were to buy your way ahead to be at around 5.000 g.
---
That is awesome! I was just a lowly resto shaman running around like a typical 10 year old then. I'm excited to be alliance this time around
---
An alt for grinding is just an opportunity to explore the world a second time and meet people in dungeons etc for a second time :)

Rooting and kiting relieves a ton of pressure off the Warrior. Charging and grenades add even more control.
---
&gt; ==
---
Found the programmer!
---
An ability that powerful definitely needs more downsides to stay in a vanilla power-level
---
I would give it a 2 minute CD and take away the rage cost. Have it hurt the warrior for 7.5% of his maximum health.
---
The reward is not logging in naked with 0 gold lol
---
Not really. In AV everyone's job is to mindlessly zerg the boss.
---
Iam UPS TSG  (our IT) and iam so excited when I see upsers talking about classic. 
---
TXDAL represent!
---
Haha! Would have been funny if you were alliance and they ported you to orgrimar for punishment
---
See this I love. it's not even all that great but it extends the class fantasy of the warlock. Make your demon tankier, potential interaction with dark pact, would be pretty good for a destruction imp build with 1 second cast time fireballs.
---
Definitely a vanilla-tier spell
---
They could just make it so no 2FA=No Support.
---
Get hacked and lose your gold? Did you have 2FA on? No? Well, tough shit.
---
Missing the alliance quest hub in the maelstrom. Trust me you can swim there in classic. Alliance only though
---
some ppl get mad cause someone bought it from a raid before they got the item themself :) that's how it always will be.
---
Time invested = meaningful progression. No bullshit Titanforge super RNG.
---
Oh god
---
Certain bosses do entirely elemental damage, which means armor will not do anything to mitigate it. For fights like those tanks need to have the proper resist gear. There are some fights where the bosses do huge aoe magic damage and for fights like that everyone needs the proper resist gear. Nature and frost resist are the most needed for dps classes for certain fights in aq and naxx, dps dont really need fire resist. Tanks will need a fire frost and nature resist set starting as early as MC. Shadow resist has a niche use to allow warlocks to tank twin emps but has little value outside of that and arcane resist is a meme.
---
Hi, /u/electricMelktert
---
Classic will be profitable. Even if it’s only the 70,000 people on this sub. That’s what SHOULD matter. What I’m afraid of is execs thinking, “this project didn’t increase my salary by $1,000,000, so it should be shut down.”
---
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.
---
Love this series.   Hope this is just the beginning.
---
Continue with the car analogy, is a '66 mustang worse because someone upgraded the engine? Maybe fitted air con (if it was an E model), or put in new seats, maybe a piece to the sound system so you can hook up via bluetooth (somehow not making it a digital hud).
---
I'd say no. 
---
Now compare a '66 to a mid '90s Mustang. They are like two different cars.
---
I want my vanilla wow to "feel" like i was driving a stock '66 stang, but I want it to benefit from all the no nonsense improvements. Retail wow feels like a different generation of wow, not a refined version of what I fell in love with.
---
Imo, BC and Ulduar/ICC (the other 1/2 of wrath was the beginning signs of the end) were the peak of the original incarnation of wow. MOP was the last time it was good at all. Since then its been as though they are more concerned with high MPGs and low emissions (to continue the car analogy) over raw speed and, well, the "wildness" that a Mustang namesake promotes.
---
: (
---
Also you'll hopefully have an epic mount and do it in no time at all comparatively.
---
Why would you think they just made their accounts 2 years after release?
---
60 to 80 rage? No way. Even 2h crits only give like 12-13 rage in pre-BiS gear. I normally Tank, so I’m not sure about rank 14 weaps. Maybe a fixed value would be better, but then it’d be stronger for sword and board and dual wield. I went with 20 sec because that’s roughly how long an evenly skilled 1v1 fight lasts. Maybe usable only in battle stance as a restriction?
---
Maybe they reduced it because it was easier to 3D model :)
---
*Loyal Sacrifice (Rank 1)* \- **Replacement of the final spell in the Beast Mastery talent tree.**
---
Mana Cost: 80
---
Cooldown: 30 minutes
---
**Loyal Sacrifice** (Rank 1): Disable your summoned pet and inherit 50% of its stats. Additionally, you get the pet's type-specific ability (such as a Boar's charge.) Lasts for 20 seconds. Your pet will not be summoned back once the duration ends.
---
Now, this might seem like a "meh" spell to spec all the way into BM for, consdiering how MM and Survival are usually considered to be better for PvP, but this spell has some extremely dynamic utility.
---
You can charge a player or NPC and feign death + freeze trap them, and it would be extremely useful against other Hunters to lock them in the dead zone as you catch them off guard completely. This would not only be OP in PvP, but it could also be utilized in PvE quite a lot, such as for kiting, as you can also use this on a Wind Serpent and absorb its movement speed ability. Super nice potential, and might even need some balancing. Lol.
---
TriHard
---

---
I’d assume it’s a joke on how shit Firestone is
---
BUT WHAT WAS THE PRICE? WHAT WE HAD TO GIVE IN RETURN?!?
---
Why not make it fury's version of overpower. It's only usable after taking a critical strike, strikes the enemy for weapon damage and increases rage generation from auto attacks by 50% for 5 seconds. (so its good for dual wielding still). 30 second cooldown.
---
What is this? Post 5,476 so far?
---
I can't see how anyone would be able to farm enough gold to make it worth while for some guild to carry them.
---
Even at around 10g per member, you're looking at 300-400g for a run, that's around 6 hours of farming.
---
If you have that much time to just to farm, you might as well just join a raiding guild
---
changes based on classic feedback are two expansions away.
---
They are well into developing the followup to BFA. Itll take them a year to really understand why classic is successful (if they ever do) and to then implement that. 
---
Then there is the issue of the current precedent and the current player they have attracted on live. They will have to slowly move the game in a direction, reverting the game overnight to BC design principles will force more people to leave than it will inspire more people to come back (that said, had blizzard done this 3 expansions ago--most of us would have come back--but its been what? 6 years since the last decent incarnation of wow (ill say it: MOP).
---
A Raid could use some cash to supply consumables for tanks and healers. Why not charging a shitload of gold for a weapon that doesn't supply the progress of the raid. A pvp 2 Hander definitely fits into this restrictions.
---
Though he could've waited for a blue post before making a video.
---
Ah fair enough, makes sense! Thanks for elaborating :)
---
Not all fights required all (or even any) players to have resist gear, but here’s a general list of bosses that had some sort of resistance component involved:
---
Arcane Resistance - Shazzrah, Prophet Skeram
---
Fire Resistance - Onyxia, Ragnaros, Vaelestraz, Firemaw
---
Frost Resistance - Sapphiron, Kel'Thuzad
---
Nature Resistance - Princess Huhuran, Viscidus, Maexxna, Grobbulus
---
Shadow Resistance - Doom Lord Kazzak, Loatheb, C'Thun trash mobs
---
No Grinding DM is probably the best BUT it gets boring so sometimes you can just make Profit off of pots and also alot of Profit off flasks
---
More attic junk
---
Content creators curse. Everybody wants to be the first one uploading his video.
---
**Warlock**
---
Trained at: 60
---
Health Cost: 15% of total health
---
Cooldown: 1 minute
---
Soul Rip: Rip a part of the target's soul from their body, draining X mana (probably equivalent to a mana burn) and generating 1 soul shard.  
---
**Hunter**
---
Trained at: 40
---
Call Mount: Whistle, calling your trusty mount to your side. (It always bothered me that paladins could summon a horse out of thin air but hunters couldn't tame one.)
---
Call Mount...Louder: Whistle a little bit louder, calling your other trusty mount that is faster, to your side.
---
Sounds like it was perfectly balanced before but they changed by reducing xp required because they mistakenly thought people didnt enjoy leveling. Then, when people complained about the faster leveling, instead of rolling back to the previous near perfection, they messed it up further by adding scaling, which removed any sense of growth and development.
---
What is the best class for boosting, besides paladin?
---
Hes in the alpha! No sleep!
---
Wait, really? Which ones?
---
Chillidari for demonhunter ofc
---
we can argue about style and taste all day, but technically, the game looks MUCH better than it did in Wrath-Vanilla. 
---
Now, Ive got less confidence in their terrain design team. The world of azeroth, i dunno, fits its scale so much better than the SUPER rail roady, often narrow-hallway-esc worlds of wod and on. 
---
Azeroth and to a lesser extent bc (we had too much flying in northrend to get terribly comfortable with the land), felt like characters. I remember individual hills and trees and buildings, places ive been jumped, or had /s conversations. places Ive waited for a quest spawn, places ive desperately used to break LOS. 
---
Back then you could actually break out of the game world. When was the last time someone posted an exploration video? 
---
Give me same terrain with updated textures. Give me the option to update world textures and/or character models. If they can do to WoW Classic what they did to SC1 and D1 and WC2, id be happy.
---
Uh oh, he didn't make any reference to summer at all.
---
I agree WOTLK was fantastic. I loved ICC...But with an asterisk. If you look at raid content before ICC there were multiple raids relevant at one time. Starting with ICC continuing all the way to current WoW raids are only relevant until the next raid comes out. That’s just one of the issues. 
---
To reiterate, I still think WOTLK was great all the way to the end. However the design philosophy changed and they began to make design decisions at the End of that expansion that lead us to where we are now.  It didn’t ruin WOTLK by any means,  but it set WoW on the road to destruction
---
I don't know how you do it. My hype dies if I spoil it in private servers. I get tired of having to start all over again and see the same areas and the same dungeons if there isn't enough buffer time between starting fresh again. I wish i could still play and still be hyped. It's painful waiting and anticipating for me.
---
I'm going to punt gnomes and there's nothing you can do about it
---
Exactly.  I'm fine with most decisions so long as i'm kept informed.  
---
Bonus points if they explain a bit too, showing the logic.
---
Do you have a number on how many vanilla pservers are thriving? I ask because two or three servers that are stuffed to the brim would still only be around 15-20 thousand people, not all of whom are actively playing. A small amount of servers can thrive for a long time on relatively little demand. Do you really think that private servers are secretly supporting a multi-million playerbase, with little to no IT staff or funding? The reason I mentioned BR’s is because that’s where the market attention has largely been for the past couple years, and before that it was zombie games, and before that it was DOTA style games. There will continue to be a niche market for every style of game, but the huge influx of players comes when the market has buzz for a certain type of game. Like it or not, early 2000’s MMOs are not topping the charts right now. If you’ve been around the forums much you’ll notice a lot of potential players are now adults with busy lives and families. One reason WoW killed at launch was because tons and tons of gamers in the 10-20 age range flocked to it. If we want large scale success with Classic, we need to pull in that current market segment and not just try to retain the aging segment that’s 20-40. 
---
But you can call my argument ridiculous without giving any evidence, that’s fine.
---
Now I love levelling to 60 but when you add levelling to 70, 80, 85, 90, 100, 110 and 120 that's quite a long, long time spend levelling in a game whose design now mostly focuses on end-game content. 
---
As I said, I don't enjoy scaling, but just saying "have fun playing through fourteen years of old content over months on end" isn't an great alternative either.
---
Okay, I had to look up what altruism was (also because I'm not native English). I didn't know there was such a strong definition ha! Then I guess you're right. What I above joked about wasn't real altruism, because it depending on expecting it to, on average, pay back in the long run?
---
Semi off-topic, but just wanna know:
---
So, suppose I'd say: "I like to help people because I would like help from someone like myself in their situation". That isn't real altruism either, right?
---
Spec in pvp literally didn't matter when my guild would just roll into wsg with our t3 and 1-2 shot literally everything that stood in our way. Maybe 1/10 games was against another well geared guild and most of the time we outgeared them.
---
Oh, that is a really cool idea. 30 second CD then?
---
Handsome boi
---
Definitely doable in Vanilla, prot paladin is just a really good AoE farmer no matter what. I've seen people do full SM, and even past that, solo BRD Arena runs on private servers as prot paladin, so if that's doable then I imagine SM has to be on retail once you get some good reflect gear + reasonable defenses. Prot is sick
---
I just downloaded this and stayed up until 3:30 AM playing through the Orc campaign only to close it and realize it doesn't automatically save after you complete missions. 
---
Ugh. Zug Zug.
---
That seems like pserver price, 5000g? Please
---
You bastard made me dream...
---
for folks possibly confused about 'alpha' vs 'beta'      
---
**alpha:** should have most core functionality, but incomplete and possibly with known bugs.   It's at the 'almost done, lets see how many ways we can break what we have' phase'        
---
**beta:** feature complete, very few minor tasks or bugs, at the 'we think we have it finished, let's try and break it' phase.      
---
I wouldn't get too upset about things.  summer release ought to be within the realm of possibility, given they have appropriate manpower on the project.
---
He meant in spirit. Thats why warrior gear has all the +spirit.
---
Oh.
---
soggyplace
---
&gt;Do you not?
---
Just saying, common courtesy at the time was to not roll need unless you could actually equip the item right then and there. To do otherwise would be seen as being a ninja, at least on the two servers I played on during the time period. 
---
\&gt;  Enhancement is a main spec, and was perfectly viable DPS (when taking support into account) in a low level dungeon. 
---
Sure, but the warrior was of appropriate level AND benefited from the stats more.
---
FFFFFUUUUUUUUUUU BLIZZARD
---
Seems like the obvious solution is to sell jump potions for content you dont like. Blizz wins, players who dont like leveling wins, and players who do like leveling wins. Its a win win win.
---
&gt; they just started their alpha at the end of April, and assuming they do a somewhat typical Blizzard testing schedule
---
assuming they do a somewhat typical Blizzard testing schedule, they won't fix any bugs reported on the beta.
---
So, they can as well skip it, and release Classic right away.
---
BTW, the first testing started on Blizzcon.
---
Googled it, and vanilla private servers apparently rock more than a million players total.
---
Well it's not like anyone was expecting some country music or something thrown in.
---
This doesn't mean they'll actually be used, or that there will be a toggle, but the physical files are there.
---
Nice, I don't have that one. Don't think I've seen it around before. I have an [artbook](https://i.imgur.com/XEKeVWQ.jpg) though, which has all the classic drawings.
---
/u/tentoedpete is sort of right.
---
I was thinking a true vanilla spell is one that you don’t ever used and was removed in retail.
---
I went with the warlock stones lol.
---
The irony is that at lvl 60 you sacrifice your pet while raiding anyways lol
---
Yep, after having played and loved morrowind back in the day, TeS: Oblivion was probably one of my most anticipated game releases of all time, and turned out to be the biggest disappointment of all time instead (though i still had some fun in it) - the horrendous scaling system was one of the main culprits in that.
---
Doesn't the boat loop around the island though?
---
I've been that laying out how things will go down with the GF since Classic was announced. Even before that when Nost 2.0 was about to launch.
---
I even pick up on some chores and reminder her about how exactly how indisposed I will be when Classic launches.
---
The weekend before launch I have designated as chore and date weekend. This will be FAIR compensation for what will go down a few days later. (Though half the chores will consist of batch cooking for Classic.)
---
There should be absolutely zero confusion.
---
   *Dances on mailbox*
---
Yea, I agree. It's a long list of things that they have to change, but flying mounts were a really bad idea.
---
My to do list is mc and only attunements.   Then bis farming.   Going for all my ubrs items first in case I get lucky and get a felstriker.   But theres a few items from ubrs anyways so it will be quite a few runs.      Weapons also being main source of dps.     But overall my priority is   ony then mc then ubrs.    Ony first because its proof to your guild of the commitment.
---
I had the same bank issue as you!
---
Hunter I'd assume but anything with good AOE at 80 will probably work
---
I’d like some of that hd bone
---
I like post like this pls more :)
---
So you can catch up to other players who are also mindlessly running old raids for transmogs
---
They look more realistic. Which imo is a flaw, since the textures are low quality. I like the artistic feel of vanilla wow more than the weird mix between realism and fantasy in retail wow.
---
Zelda Breath of the Wild is a great example on why realism isn't always the way to go
---
I agree with this
---
You are asking these things as if the shaman will have any reasonable priority over the better damage dealers.
---
If anything, he is the last one to get that stuff.
---
The intense weather went such a big distance for mood setting and making the world feel more alive. For a while there I was starting to think it had never been as intense as I thought it was. Thanks for reaffirming my sanity.
---
Have you checked inside the Naxxramas folder yet?
---
Just some context. This happened after one of many Razorgore wipes back in the day. Instead of appearing at the graveyard to run back, I was floating in this odd space with a vortex above and below me. I seemed to me moving across the map oddly enough but I couldn't move and nothing worked.
---
I've never seen anything like it before or after this happened--I never saw it again anyway, and it took an hour before a GM had to have me removed, after which I ended in the Wetlands based on the distance I had traveled while in Purgatory. The GM made a joke about my Lava Dredger throwing a wrench into time or something like that.
---
I was looking through old WoW vids of mine and figured this might be interesting to some.
---
As far as I know, 'fast respawn' or variable respawn rates weren't added until wrath.
---
That's one of the options they may explore to address the initial flood, or sharding, but I'd be surprised if they went with both, and I'd be even more surprised if either stayed around for longer than a  week.

Introducing Score Gear! 
---
Tired of looking for Gear? Well with score Gear your gear now has an experience bar allowing you to level your iLvl without having to worry about pesky things like where it drops or what the next bis item is. Simply buy the items using you bnet wallet ($45 per item) and start doing anything in the game. Your items will even level while you afk on the capital!
---
But, making flasks for profit relies on picking lotuses, which isn’t possible on the level 35 alt suggested above.
---
There are specs you can level with that also work in 5-mans. And then similar specs at 60 that let you have utility in grinding and PvP while also maintaining healing power in Raids. Things are generally slower.
---
The hybrids (Paladin, Druid) are great in this regard in that you can still kill stuff and heal in dungeons/raids.
---
Seeing how they will use shards for the early game zones and rather opt for blizzlike servers population wise I think they do everything to prevent messing with respawn timers. 
---
There's just too much of a rats tail that gets exploited on a daily basis on various pservers which shows that respawn timers are not to be tinkered with.
---
The are very good but take a lot of bandages / food / hp pots.  Buy nice MH from vendor early even if it takes all your money.  Garrote is mvp, most under appreciated skill.   Early on its mainly single pulls or 2 + evasion, or 3 with sap / evasion available.  Once you get poisons you can double pull a lot more easily, after first is dead you can gouge and bandage.  If things get really bad you can gouge and run until 5 combo points and kidney shot but thats 30+.  With blade flurry you can reliably 2-3 mob pull once every 2 mins.  Once you get adrenaline rush you can pair that with blade flurry / evasion and pull up to 5 mobs or so once every 5 minutes.
---
Technically from the point of texture resolution, it's much better. If they can increase it while keeping the same looks (Warcraft 3 remaster looks ugly as hell, for example) then yeah, it will be good.
---
&gt; Enchanting: I would not bother with this profession at any stage of the game. Instead I would get my enchants via the guild enchanter.
---
It’s worth noting, if you’re going to rely on guild enchanter, send them some of your more useless greens so they can skill up enchanting.

Thanks for the sincere reply m8

---
Im not lying m8. I cannot say that I wasnt surprised that wow ran so bad.
---
Yep, what are you looking for?
---
Damn that's powerful lmao. Gonna need like a 2 hour CD on that atleast man. It also kinda kills the whole "combat rezzer" niche of druid.
---
Amazing and fun to watch, really like your animation techniques! :)
---
Be aware that a lot of us use addons like *Spy!* that parse the combat log constantly and warn with a big, shiny, loud, over-our-head-can't-miss **KAZABODOO CASTS STEALTH** notifications even if you're so far we can't hear it.
---
We know...
---
AFAIK lotuses are not BOP or am I wrong?
---
Classic music in classic wow.
---
Thank you for this incredible discovery with your “data mining”
---
IMO it would be fine if they allowed HD character models as a toggle
---
It really isn't a big deal, world firsts of Ony / Rag / C'thun and Kel Thuzad were all done on horde.  People are much better now so pve will not really be an isssue.  If you have 40 players playing on either faction raid content will be pretty easy.
---
Why are your both level 60 characters at Hellfire Peninsula?
---
I think sharding will be a better option. WoWs original vanilla release did NOT have this hype or player flood that this release will have.
---
If you’ve been there for the release of a private server, you know exactly why we need sharding for the first few weeks. At least level 1-20 zones.
---
For sure man. Some of my favorite memories of WoW was being around level 40, not knowing where anything is, and ending up in Redridge somehow. I spent the next week or two with this random rogue who would come with me ganking lowbies. You could still talk to the other faction in 1337 speak at the time and made friends with some of them. 
---
This was when 60’s were still rare and they actually came and defended areas under attack so I’d have to run to the lake and swim to the bottom of it to get away. Catform stealth and repeat. 
---
I hadn’t thought about this in a while, thanks for reminding me of it!
---
While I *personally* think that's a good thing (as a toggle), I can see there being some purists who hate even the concept of it.
---
It'll be controversial to say the least
---
if privs work then vanilla/classic should be good, eh? only time will tell
---
It's mostly the karma
---
Dude you're hilarious with your lowercase short winded zero intelligence replies, your down syndrome "me mad me downvote" followers love it.
---
It‘s easy:
---
It‘s all training for retail and there‘s no better game anyway.
---
Everything else is just not the same fun or even close.
---
Diablo 3 was never good and became the worst waste of time meanwhile (ok I played it for a thousand hours, but that‘s a different story) and diablo 2 is only cool one month a year.
---
And since I love gaming, I‘m playing vanilla.
---
I see a big part of fun in getting better though, maybe that‘s what keeps me going.
---
And yeah, most of all the fun is the social interaction and the „together“. And that’s not limited by repetition.
---
Unpopular opinion: I would prefer updated graphics with the same GAMEPLAY MECHANICS as classic wow.
---
It's the zones I'm getting burned out on. I love Darkshore, it's by far my favorite zone but I can only do it so many times before I get tired of it.
---
No Rez, so for long walk backs after a wipe, you will likely get your spot taken from a healer that can rez.
---
Druid did not tank back in vanilla (at least as an optimal spec) and did not Boomkin. You will be a healer and a sub optimal healer without a rez.
---
ok, a different approach...  whatever gets druids a proper rez .
---
Requires: reagent ( cheap )
---
Resurrect entire Group. ( out of combat only )  
---
33% chance to backfire and kill you instead
---
I mean, yeah you can... I didn't run around saying "beta confirmed" to tens of thousands of followers or whatever even though I was VERY excited bout the prospect... because it was never confirmed in the first place.
---
It's not that we can't be excited and can't publicly speculate, but it's another thing when we run around the community claiming things are confirmed that aren't. It's not like this is a huge deal that they misreported things, but at the same time come on... we should all be able to agree that these large public persona's in our community shouldn't be pushing speculation as fact.
---
I never knew the name of the files for the songs, but just looking at the list I can hear each zones music in my head.  So excited!

---
All the RPG elements that were removed from the game as everyone wanted things faster easier and less thought required.
---
There will be several QoL things I will miss, but it will be worth it just for the little things like actual talent trees and skill progression with weapons and abilities.  
---
While tedious at times having to form a group and physically go to a dungeon for a slim chance of the drop you are hunting is very rewarding.  Almost like dark souls in a way.
---
I miss my non modded profession farming routes, and the amount of fun I had simply fighting for/collecting arcanite and thorium for heartseekers or arcanite reapers.
---
I miss the sense of “server reputation” and community.  “You want to join this guys AV groups if you want to win” “Don’t invite this guy he’s on the forum ninja looter list.”  “Oh shit its xxxxx the undead rogue,  he will definitely be camping me”.  
---
Just a lot of little thing the game phased out over the years that hooked me in the first place.  I was 18 in 2004 and I’m 33 now.  I have at least 3 other friends with the same nostalgia/hype as me so hoping to have a semi permanent group ready to go.
---
I have played every expansion since release, and the last 3 or so I just basically play and limit my end game to world stuff and LFR.  Definitely had more to hook me in legion with the time released stuff and legendaries to play for, but usually only 1-2 months at a time.  
---
Im excited to jump into a game I have spent thousands of hours in that still gets me wanting to do just this last thing before logging out.
---
Looking at HP bars
---
Could you tell please, does the list include any tavern music (it was added later in TBC) and/or the original music theme from the Brill tavern?
---
Country music
---
Druid's good starting the fight invisible, waiting til the last second and then throwing out an instant healing touch to start the real fight.
---
WEST VIRGINIA!!!!!
---
I want classic wow but graphically I could care less. Play like vanilla but look good would be great
---
I think Wizardry 8 is an example of a game that did it well.  The enemies that spawn in each game area vary according to what level you are because depending on whether you made a new party or imported a party from the previous game you could start in any of 4 different places, so they had to make it possible to survive certain areas at lower levels.  The end result is actually a really unusual difficulty spike in the mid-game.
---
If you need something to play to pass the time before Classic WoW comes out, I can't recommend Wizardry 8 highly enough.  It's absolutely one of the greatest games I've ever played, and it's very challenging on the expert difficulty level.
---
Its said that there will be graphic like vanilla but Im uncertain tbh
---
Yeah, that's specifically why I asked. I was apart of a couple private server launches and the increased respawn rates, I didn't feel, solved the problems that plague new server launches. There were still crashes, kicks, long queues, and named quest mobs and items were still a pain in the ass.
---
Sharding is definitely the way to go - and will be easy turn off after the initial zerg. I just know it was a controversial topic and wasn't sure if Blizz was still going to implement it. That's great news if they are; they have to mitigate the zerg.
---

Gotta make that ez gold somehow
---
Which is as I expected. That's why I was questioning the previous commenter claiming that raiding was favored by Alliance. Yes, dwarf priests have fear ward, but fear isn't used for all that many bosses in Vanilla and Horde has tremor totem. And both factions have stance dancing for Berserker Rage. I guess that there's just too many people on this subreddit who think that "mix/max" is the only way to operate and if you're not doing it, then you can't succeed. Probably the same people who think that World Buffs are essential for successful raiding as well, having gotten use to them on pservers, forgetting that in Vanilla, those buffs have a much longer cooldown and hence are not available to nearly the same extent.
---
Not Vanilla btw
---
YouTube has a bunch of videos where people tell you what to farm in your mid 30s. Just focus on the ones with vendorable items
---
Flashback to all those [The Nicker] jokes
---
Neat, I never saw it myself other than when it happened to me.
---
Anal \[Scorch\]   
---
Summons Admin on chat and gets you banned
---
I agree, like the adventure and the feel is what people miss, the graphics are just some weird edgy thing people add in like it's the only way to play.
---
You don't farm the same way as some of the stronger DPS classes, but vanilla had plenty of ways to make money. On my holy priest, I would take the Holy Nova talent to be able to AoE lower-level mobs and make a little bit of money that way.
---
As far as PvP, being a healer is amazing fun in world PvP and groups. It's kinda silly to be a pure healer and 1v1. You're basically just staying alive long enough for help to arrive since your DPS output is really low.
---
I would say that dual spec was actually a fantastic idea, BUT they should've slapped a one hour cooldown on it and only made it possible to swap specs at your class trainer in a major city. That way everyone gets flexibility to play two different roles while retaining action bars and not getting financially ruined, but you can't just swap between them on the go as you see fit - which changed gameplay way too much imo.
---
I completely agree, I’m a “no change” believer, but this is a change that’s necessary. Without sharding, this is gonna be miserable for weeks. I need sharding through 1-20 zones, then after 1 month turn off sharding completely.

---
Personally, I think that 35 - 40 is grind time. Either that or make GOOD friends with Paladin and Warlocks. Borrow the gold they don't need for their 40 mount and lay them back at 60 :)
---
This used to be a thing on retail servers (my guild did it so that we could supply flasks to the tanks). This is still a thing on private servers. Saw a guild yesterday selling eye of divinity.
---
Whirlwind axe quest hell yeah

---
Country roads, take me home, to the place where I belong; Westfall
---
would you expect more or less?
---
College football starting is the true marker of fall
---
Did you mean they drop 10 pieces total or each time they are downed?
---
Hey man, I always just do skinning and herbalism, loot all mobs, and sell everything. People that don't loot mob trash don't know what they are missing out on, some mob trash sells for a decent amount of coin.
---
Also, plan out ahead of time what skills you absolutely need. Don't buy skills that aren't necessary and just avoid the auction house unless you get a drop you can sell. People tend to blow Mount money on shiny objects that they end up out leveling.
---
I'm a firm believer in leveling up with gather profs and then at 60 drop them and power level the profession you really want.
---
I've always bought my mount right at 40. Hope this helps!
---
imo BC was the best, can't wait for classic though!
---
It's fairly easy, especially for gatherer professions. Skinning alone you can vendor the leather for a good profit, and oh will you have leather. Especially in your mid 30s for both factions you'll be killing a lot of beasts.
---
I saw a post long ago, but it was westeen plagelands
---
&gt;Just saying, common courtesy at the time was to not roll need unless you could actually equip the item right then and there. To do otherwise would be seen as being a ninja, at least on the two servers I played on during the time period. 
---
This was just simply not the case on the two servers I played on.
---
It comes down to this. Both players in such a situation *needs* the item. They both *benefit*.
---
What *you* did was attach an arbitrary measure of "who needs it more" based on your own subjective feelings.   
---
The adult thing to do is look at who you're in the group with and ask "hey can I have it if it drops?" and if the Paladin/Shaman you're grouped with says no then that's how it is.   
---
It isn't "unfair" and they wouldn't be unreasonable, because you do not have a clear argument for why they don't need it, only that you need it "more". And as you've probably realised by now the "more" part isn't universally accepted either.
---
i mean when i have time/feel like, i'll probably join a casual raid guild to see if i can scope up a few things.
---
but sometimes if i'm staying in on a friday night gaming, i'd rather just PvP instead of raiding.
---
eminem is that you?
---
Even has Ashjre'Thul
---
do you guys not realize you can farm gold over time, at random time slots, and for small intervals?
---
a raid, esp if you're not in the hardcore guild but in casual where everyone sucks, can take 2-3 hours or more if you include the time for waiting for a piece or two that you want that may not drop.
---
They were at one point in vanilla, but not in Classic. The problem with buying them is it will eat into your profits quite a bit.

I love skinning personally. What about mining? Is herb just more profitable?
---
I believe they’re called vaginal lids.

I’m pumped
---
I haven't seen him confirming anything, I just saw his video yesterday and reopened it right now to double check I heard right.
---
Pretty much he tells right in the first minute "...not necessarily coming out in the first two weeks, maybe 5 or 6 but it's just speculation".
---
So, why the hate? It wasn't no more or less stuff than what I've read right into this sub for the past days.
---
yea i mean i kinda get it but at the same time i don't give a shit.
---
once i have decent gear, i'd rather spend my time killing people and shit when i play rather then killing raid bosses

Do you vendor the herbs that you gather or put them on the AH?
---
More like 'even remotely hear the stealth sound while in STVietnam'
---
haha exactly!
---
So long as it's a toggle on your own end it's fine. And honestly it's hard for me to say which version I would use since theirs good and bad for both.
---
Loatheb shadow damage is not resistible thus SR gear has no value that fight.

This is a thing on private servers but not beyond MC loot.

The sock is the toilet paper.
---
I have the same concerns as you about the release date but I'm still optimistic and hopeful for at least a mid summer release. Even if open beta is released I'll still be happy. Honestly, Blizzard has been pretty tight lipped about this project so I think that the fact they came out and said it will be a summer of Classic still holds some weight. I will trust in them to hold their words. Again, even if they release a beta version, I'd still be very happy.
---
Invite me when you find this!
---
Could be a holdover they didn't remove yet, game could break if they don't exist. Doesn't mean anything if they are just disabled. But hey if we can use them I wouldn't complain.
---
same same :D
---
Do you Happen to know for how much more than the mat cost you can sell Supreme power for?
---
I still think it'll be around July. I don't see either the internal alpha or beta being long enough to push it all the way to the end of summer.
---
I'd love TBC and Wotlk servers in the future.
---
Even so, it's pretty close to perfect already IMO. It's pretty cool how well they've restored it when you contrast it to what they started with in the retail client/engine.
---
Welcome to the civilized side ;)
---
Meh, use all the help you can get, you are going to need it.
---
I want race specific animations instead of class animations. I hate how every race currently melee animations are the exact same for each class. I want my undead warriors raging blow to look different than my Tauren.
---
Give me more Fem undead flips!
---
I can't really advise you as I'm in the same predicament. Only difference is I Maines a feral druid and loved every minute of it. Rank 11.mostly world pvped after bwl, etc... Now I'm struggling with whether to feral again or do mage/lock. Another hold back with doing feral again, is feral gear is severely lacking until phase 3. So who knows how long I'll have to be limp dick for. (yes I know pvp gear comes in phase 2, but farming rank 10 in world pvp only takes a while... And the bg rep rewards are huge itemization wise too) 
---
I think I personally like lock play style better, but mage is solid and can grind gold, and zg rep when it's released, easily.
---
But all BM talents buff the pet so this would be pretty useless compared to bestial wrath. Also without bestial wrath in pvp u will get shit on
---
Sure, but my point is that you'd need to farm for dozens of hours just get enough gold to make it worthwhile for a guild to carry you.
---
Plus it takes much more time to gear 40-man group in vanilla than it does for a 20-man on retail.
---
You only get like 4 pieces of gear per boss
---
Music for me has always been disabled and replaced by something to fit my mood of the day.
---
I remember being an altoholic and leveling multiple toons to 40+ and I never had trouble buying mounts at 40 with them even though I was prepared to use my main to help. Just loot and sell things, mail things that auction well to your bank alt, and you should get 100 gold by lvl 40 no problem.
---
Yes healing abilities are also spells.
---
That druid spell would be so broken, it would prolly have to be nerfed to only make u untargetable to be viable for vanilla
---
He looks amazing. And the goggles mean he is badass.
---
As someone whose two greatest hobbies is playing the banjo and classic wow, i feel like this would complete my life.
---
Strugglers unite!
---
Fake News.
---
Every boss fight music is going to be replaced with this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNkQMtZAMAw
---
My Dad owns Classic WoW and told me so.
---
If I remember correctly, it would be often done for certain items within an instance.  If all your players of a certain class has a certain item , then you invited them into the raid group and stand by the entrance till the boss was killed.  If your item dropped you were summoned to pay and loot it.   So the whole raid wasn’t dictated around one person but they were able to sell certain pieces after their members were geared.
---
We living in 2019 while orkhus living in 2013
---
This isn’t your traditional alpha/beta phases since it’s not a brand new game but a rerelease of an old one. Should be very fast to go through
---
Mained a paladin since BC until mid cata when I switched to priest. Bounced between the two ever since. That said, even though I love the paladin class, I don't think I could bear to level one in classic. Auto attacking with a judgment once in a while is mind numbing. Also, since I am not big into PvP, my PvE options are to be a buffbot. Therefore I am pretty sure I will be rolling a priest...because for me, healing is where it's at.
---
Probably too late for me :) I’m thinking 8-11pm?
---
I’ve had the Thunder Bluff music in my head a lot lately and this picture is just as breathtaking as the music. Still one of my favorite places to visit (saying this as an Alliance main atm, too!)
---
Should be able to start checking add-ons for compatibility of they can get into the world.
---
A goddamn release date!
---
In this thread; people who post way too broken spells for vanilla
---
Same. I would be surprised to see it released before July and the testing phases shouldn't be too lengthy with them mostly testing the database and graphics imo.
---
When you create a character in WoW Classic I want to see it like YOU intended the character to be seen. Community game, right?
---
That's why I perfectly understood when they removed the vanilla models from retail as well. Your decisions matter, they affect the game experience of the people around you. And that includes aesthetics that "no one should care about".
---
There would be a massive disconnect when you stare at your ultra HD badass Male Dwarf model, while others see a serial rapist approaching:
---
http://i.imgur.com/PA5Xw3N.jpg
---
HD sunshafts, shadows or water are one thing, but completely different player models goes too far.
---
If I'm not mistaken sharding has definitely not been confirmed.
---
Yeah, WPL works much better, it has just the right amount of syllables. Westfall was just the thing that first came to my mind when thinking of an idyllic scene described in a country song. Also it has "west" in it as well.
---
No, but some people did expect the way worse Cataclysm Battleground music to make it in.
---
an old game with more potential bugs than any expansion...
---
Yeah, 10% is hammer of wrath time.
---
You don't need fire resist in MC.
---
I still think this is one of those things that sounds more appealing than it actually is, the new models look so out of place in the old world and decked out in low res gear.
---
What time zone are you in?
---
Need vs comfort.
---
Just as a repeat: Some people expected the Cataclysm Battleground tracks to make it in. So it's not really some karma-whore post.
---
They do have a thottbot themed version of there website.
---
Can’t wait to get a motherfuckin wingblade
---
Alliance. Horde races are trash (except Belfs which aren't in vanilla) and Horde cities are trash (except Silvermoon which isn't in vanilla). I'd never sully myself with such filth.
---
Hi, /u/Belgore
---
As a souvenir?
---
Much less, 5k gold is such a enormous amount in vanilla
---
I played a resto druid in TBC focused mostly on PvP and being a healer involves anticipating damage before they happen. So if you see an enemy loading up a spell on your party member, you want to start casting a big heal so that your party member can't get quickly bursted down.
---
You also need to keep tabs on debuffs. Again, anticipate where the debuffs are going. As a priest/pally you have more things you can remove than a druid. Learn other classes, find out what their most optimal rotations are.
---
Don't forget about your support role. Things like stunning enemies at crucial times that allow you to burst their parties down, meleeing/autoattacking casters to make their casting take longer or force them to focus on you. Etc. As a Druid I had many more tools to assist including bear form charge, stun, root, cat form stealth pounce, and in TBC I also had cyclone.
---
Take a walk and have a beer dude.
---
The ONLY thing I have any concern with is the way new water doesn't let you hide like the old water did. Everything else, even view distance, I say use whatever looks the best to you, even if I'm gonna be on classic mode.
---
When nameplates have a pretty short pop-in distance, that water can be the difference between life and death, and also provides some funny ambush opportunities.
---
Anyone got a YT clip of the HD animations? Only familiar with the old ones and I must say... it influences my race/gender choices!
---
Wow this is really great. How does it have so few views?
---
HD models suck. It's supposed to be YOUR character so other players should see it the same way as you do.
---
Oh shit.  And if we do it near Dun Morough then we can start soon after
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/
---
The layout/UI may not be the exact same, but the aesthetics are there.
---
It's not about being a purist, it's that the new models are worse for most characters, specifically the female ones.
---
Slap on a tabard on a 1.12 server vs a retail one on any fem char and you'll notice the awful boobjob distorting everything imminently, also very basic things like attachment points for shoulders were never corrected either
---
Totally new all the way, it won't ever be the same as before so don't try to force it.
---
Skinning is a save pick. Vendoring all leathers give a decent chunk of gold.
---
As a rogue the only class I don't bother with is warriors. Not worth it, one overpower crit and you're basically done.
---
July is 3 months away. We still have no release date and no beta. Everyone that's convinced themselves that its going to release in July are only setting themselves up to be disappointed.
---
What are some reasons you're considering warlock? Your initial post only references that it'd be a new experience. What would you look forward to in playin a lock other than that?
---
Other than comfort, what are some things you remember about mage that may outshine the lock?
---
At first, there will be alot of new players checking it out. I think alot of players will drop off after the first month or so when they realize how slow you level and how much of a grind it is. I don't mind the grind myself, but the average time (judging from what I've read on different forums) from 1-60 was about 15 days /played. That's about 360 hours and I doubt many new players will have the patience for that, and I definitely don't think that new players coming in from the newer expansions will.
---
The major problems were with the lighting (the demo was to "contrasty", especially at night) and the weather effects were missing.
---
I do expect them to correct these (and basically anything we may not have noticed), though. :)
---
They went about making the world more alive the wrong way.
---
They should stop adding more continents every expansion and build on what they already have.
---
Additional changes were done in 7.3.5 when scaling was introduced. All Vanilla zones are now accessible at level 40, even if before that, they were, for example, 50 - 55.
---
For me, I like prefer how humans look. I'd rather like my character and be at a minor disadvantage than hate my character just to min/max. I plan to roll a human priest.
---
dude shut the fuck up its the internet
---
its not a minor  disadvantage thou, its huge. But yeah i agree play what you think looks best :)
---
GDKP runs were a thing, guild hosted or straight up PuG's. Loot drops, people bid gold, gold gets redistributed evenly at the end. Most commonly seen in MC, as people still want Bindings or Sulfuras mats (If they aren't reserved, the run will be a shit show) even in later content.
---
would guess mage maybe but i think paladin is pretty irreplacable
---
As an Orc Warrior hungry for battle I endorse this message. Bring it on! FOR THE HORDE, MOTHAFUCKAS!
---
Which is how it was - i dont think they are going to be trying to fix bugs that were around in retail 1.12
---
I feel you, but many people have been waiting so long.  When it is so close it becomes maddening to some people.  You know when you really have to pee but there is no bathroom around.  You finally get near one and the last 15 feet to the bathroom your urge to pee increases 100 fold.  You almost pee your pants in that last 15 feet.  If they bathroom was 100 feet away you would have been fine, until the last 15 feet again.
---
You have to say HAPPY THINGZ to get upvoteZ!!1 dont u knoE?
---
I played through all of original vanilla, TBC and some of WOTLK as Alliance. First as NE Rogue, then as a Draenei Priest. Never rated Horde really...
---
I inititally was set on playing Alliance again but as someone who doesn't particularly enjoy the whole levelling journey, the thought of Elwynn Forest, Westfall and Redridge again kinda filled me with dread. 
---
So.. I've decided I'll go for Horde. Yes they are butt ugly but I've always admired Undead and it would be interesting to experience the game from the opposite perspective to how I remember.
---
I rolled fresh on of the majpr pservers and got my mount at 40 as a Tauren Druid with Skinning / Enchanting. I wanted enchanting for the lvl 265 trinket, so I leveled it casually. I farmed know what Desolace and SoS beasts from 35 and easily afforded the mount.
---
Doesn't battle net already have it?
---
Huh, I like the WC3 looks, so far. Except for the ui. Im not sold on that yet.
---
Wasn't that druid of the claw?
---
First, they have 20 minute cooldown (and there are 2 of them + normal hearthstone).
---
Second, why is that a problem? I could come here and say "Vanilla is stupid, having a hearthstone with 1 hour cooldown. What´s this fast travel crap? It doesn´t have place in MMORPG!" and it would be basically the same as you complaining about existence of 3 hearthstones with shorter cooldown (one of which is useless unless you have level 3 Garrison anyway).
---
Eh, I think when you were in pre-MC/early MC gear you were better off in the resist. Once you were farming MC though, you definitely didn't.
---
Holy Paladin because I really like paladins that rolled the class to heal!!
---
I'm not too surprised given that it's the Legion client. My guess is that they're just going to be inactive. But, then again, since we do have the Legion graphics options, I wouldn't be surprised to see them in there.
---
Pulling, kiting, tranq rotation, fd/drink, per management.
---
Loved raiding on a hunter!
---
Correction:
---
* MC: Tank wants FR gear on Rag
---
* BWL: no resist gear
---
* AQ40: 15 melee soakers want NR gear for Huhuran
---
* Naxx: everyone wants a chunk of FrR (Frost Resist) gear for Sapphiron
---
What about eastern kingdoms? Nazferiti river instead of Shenandoah? It’s the one that runs through west fall. Redridge instead of blue ridge mountains
---
That's not a correction it's a clarification
---
You're actually very lucky, because [this incident](https://www.engadget.com/2014/04/25/wow-archivist-the-martin-fury-incident-friday/) was also during WotLK, with a very different outcome.
---
I bounced between Paladin and Warrior. I like wearing plate. lol
---
WoWHead Classic\*\*
---
I really wonder what the timing will be like, I’m so happy they’re spacing it out so much. It’s going to be amazing to actually enjoy leveling again, yeah I want to hit 60, but there’s just so much of the game before max level that I can’t wait to enjoy again. So different than today’s expansions where I won’t sleep until I hit next cap.
---
...Everything.
---
Cool then the shaman doesn't need it since they can't even fucking equip it. You need this against my warrior on a shaman and you're a fucking ninja and you bet your ass I'm telling trade chat when I get back to org. FINAL
---
yes
---
That's stupid.
---
IDK, it feels like HoTS, not a Warcraft, IMO sc2 warcraft mod that was in development (probably stopped after knowing about this remaster) looked much closer to the style of Warcraft 3.
---
View distance I also find important that they keep the same, something they showed us on the demo that they were keeping.
---
I say lock, because it's a very interactive and interesting leveling and pvp experience. Its fast like a hunter when leveling but has way better lore and spells imo. 
---
Personally, I love warriors. Have played multiple at 60. But my goals for the game have changed, as well as my allotted play time, so I wont be able to keep up with the most gear dependent class in game. 
---
I'm leaning toward rogue as I have never leveled one. I'll never be able to make Classic a 100% new experience so I want to force as many new experiences as I can.
---
I ment for classic release. :D
---
Wow head isnt accurate for classic info :) Quick ess only give 1% dodge
---
Take me back...
---
Cuz of optimization and anti cheat shit, they decided to use the modern client and regress it to vanilla.  There are a few vids explaining the process briefly.
---
I'm glad they are doing it this way, I would hate playing on the 2004 client like we have to on private servers.  Crashes, long loads, glitchy relogging etc.
---
Should have made a throwaway account
---
If you can't figure out what takes time in this kind of project you propably can't understand the answers you get.
---
Pizza is a meat delivery device, if you want a salad just eat a salad.
---
Pretty much Geddon was the only MC boss where you wanted high FR.  Rag you just wanted a token bit from a few high-efficiency pieces, and the rest would just be buffs.
---
Nostalrius alone had over 700k accounts created. Estimations say over 1 million players play on private servers. https://www.dkpminus.com/blog/estimated-1-3-million-people-playing-wow-private-servers/
---
I mentioned private servers to prove that vanilla wont be as much of a niche as you think, since a lot of players choose not to play on private servers simply due to the instability and it not being "retail". With Classic going retail this number will grow exponentially.
---
Yes, BR's are popular, but why wouldn't people be able to play multiple games at once? MMO's haven't topped charts for a long time and I don't expect Classic to top it either since Classic would have to compete with Fortnite, LoL, DOTA, CSGO etc, all F2P games. But that is hardly proof of it's potential failure or it being a "niche" since topping a chart would require millions and millions of active Classic players, and a game that requires a subscription fee will never beat a popular F2P game for obvious reasons.
---
Funny how you ask for evidence while providing none yourself. The only "evidence" you provided was "Based on what I've seen" and then providing only anecdotal evidence of "All the people I know IRL that played WoW have no idea about Classic". You set the standard, not me.
---
Yea his list is bad, No geddon, no 4hmen.
---
really is. 
---
While BC was really "the beginning of the end" when daily quests for epics and unlimited gold arrived, Wrath saw an overall decline in the difficulty of content and the beginnings of 'homogenization'.
---
ICC was generally good, especially on heroic (though Prof. Putricide should have been A LOT harder than he ended up being). Ulduar was good (except for vehicle boss). TOGC was even pretty decent mechanically (except for the "pvp" boss). However it was marred by laughably easy dungeons (i could heal/tank/dps 5 mans solo as a geared spriest before ulduar was over), a joke tier in Naxxramas (except for sarth 3d 10m), and more welfare content than ever seen before. 
---
It also led us into cata which was just bad except for Rag and class combat mechanics--which were generally good all expansion. (Slight redemption in MOP for raid/class/pvp contet, id say)
---
Disliked for not linking original Mick Gordon version.
---
It's not only about releasing it when it's done, it's also about releasing it so that it's not competing with battle for Azeroth content.
---
I’m correcting your statement that says that you *need* resist gear for fire bosses in MC and BWL fights, because you don’t need it on either of those if you know what you’re doing.
---
The new models look terrible with the old World/Environment/Gear etc.
---
It’s probably for a number of reason:
---
1) integration with modern WoW api. I’m gonna try and explain this as best as I can but basically they want to take the current WoW backend code (something that includes BNet support and anti cheat software) and have it work wit patch 1.12. The main benefit of this is that Blizzard can now work with much better code...as well as enhance performance. This process is simple and it’s hard to really estimate how long this would take.
---
2) QA. With new backend support, we get better performance but that can create new bugs on the WoW 1.12 client. The game ain’t tiny so QA will be extensive.
---
Probably other reasons but these are two big ones I felt helped answer the question in a way that explains extra work outside of private servers.
---
Bwl you still need that cloak. I think that does count a little.
---
Play a shaman 😘
---
Dustwallow Marsh
---
ToT was dank aswell, imo.
---
It is also easy to state your point without being rude.  Some people don't have active accounts and therefore cannot just log on and check.
---
Never liked the play style of warriors. Also not a fan of any class that has a builder/spender play style. Nor do I like classes who are locked into one role...or classes that have a permanent pet. Priest and paladin are the only classes I have stuck with enough to main.
---
We're we expecting anything else?
---
Ah come on man I thought mine was pretty balanced. Decent mana cost, only 50% uptime, short duration.
---
Fucking lmao
---
I rerolled to Belf pally at BC launch took them over there prolly for flight paths
---
That's a fair point with a wonderful example. I forgot how ridiculous dwarves used to look back in the day hahaha
---
I seriously hope they don't actually use this.
---
The character models are actually really important in world PvP and some battlegrounds, due to what I'd call "ghetto stealth": hiding behind trees, walls, ridges, hills, bushes, etc. to avoid being seen. On PvP servers, this is one of the only way to avoid ganking from higher level players (especially when you're making the push from 50 to 60, where you can't fight geared 60s but you're still worth honour), and I remember it playing a significant role in many WSG and AB games. This doesn't work if you can't be certain of what other characters are seeing.
---
Beyond that, I also consider the ability to control how others see your character very important in an MMORPG. If I designed my character to look a particular way, I don't want half the server seeing a completely different character. That eliminates the "client-side toggle" as a viable option IMO. And having a per-character server-side toggle would be even worse for the impact on the game's aesthetic.
---
I'd be all for this if the HD characters were just higher poly count and higher resolution renders of the originals, but that's simply not the case. The silhouette is different, which actually affects gameplay, and the aesthetics are significantly different, which affects a player's agency over their character.
---
...did you expect to find music from other expansions?
---
People PAY to go to Sedona?  I wouldn't go there even if they were paying ME.
---
What about questing on rested XP?  I know it doesn't affect the quest turn in XP but it will affect the mobs you have to kill for the quest.
---
We will have a classic SUMMER, aug/sep is off the chart.
---
Have a lil faith
---
This would be so amazing, I never dabbed into d3 much after the first few months but isn’t this similar to their system? After a season ends it moves to your normal non seasonal account?
---
I definitely wanted to stay caster because it's the type of playstyle I always gravitate towards I am a big fan of being the glass cannon. What I'd most want to do on a mage is PvP as 0/30/21 I loved playing blastwave/shatter especially at the time because no one else was doing it. I figured warlock was the obvious choice as an alternative destro nukes like fire does and also provides a tankier option if you wanted to switch playstyles. As for pve I imagine they are nearly identical spamming the same spell over and over again which is fine. I know  my real concern is familiarity or something fresh I don't want to roll a lock and regret it or roll a mage and get bored because I have been there done that.
---
Nah, that is all private servers combined, but a lot of those servers will die out when Classic is released since this is what every private server player has been waiting for. Some of the biggest servers have said they will close their doors when Blizzard releases Classic since their job is done at that point and Blizzard have thus taken over, leaving no point to providing a private server any longer.
---
I Vendor the herbs. It depends on the herb, Ive done alchemy a nber of times so I put herbs on the AH that I know can be a pain to get and vendor the rest.

---
“The humanmale_hd_16.bone is connected to the, humanmale_hd_17.bone...”
---
Really? Of all the spells you could have chose, it was a ranked up fireball? 
---
I'd say pyroblast was when fire mages reach their powerspike and start feeling powerful. You get it at level 20, then blastwave at level 30.
---
You definitely want onyxia scale cloaks, but that’s not something I’d consider as resistance gear, it’s more of a prerequisite similar to attuning yourself in order to clear the raid. Resistance gear is more a “aim for X amount of Y resistance for this fight” to me.
---
Thinking about the westfall music gives me nostalgia chills. I remember sitting in the evenings, night time in game, with that music playing and just leveling and playing the game. What a great feeling.
---
Thank you for posting this! I find that I focus on the music of a game a lot more than the typical person.
---
A lot of people are saying, "What did u expect lol?" but there are plenty of people that want the updated models in classic, so who's to say those people wouldn't want the "updated" music?
---
They 100% said there would be a toggle since it's all client side.
---
I'm not worried about it. Someone else who likes Dwarves will play a dwarf priest and there will certainly be more than 1 healing priest in a 40-man raid. They can take care of the occasional fight that requires (or is much easier with) fear ward. I can earn my keep by being a good healer.
---
There should be a sticky for data mined info.
---
What was your main/what will you be changing to if you don't mind me asking?
---
Neither.  
---
Can't really remember what the spec was, but I was allowed to go deep enhance for improved WF totem. Still healing in raids but could farm decently and go LolWF in PvP, but without the rest of enhance it was meh.
---
None of the legion music files are ingame tho. This tells me there will be a toggle most likely.
---
pretty sure a fully geared SM warrior is the true menace of STVietnam
---
OpenGL support.. i know this is minority concern, but let me explain.
---
Part of my original vanila experience is tied to my archaic macbook pro 2010. I was able to play up to bfa prepatch but then with 8.0 blizz cut opengl support a now only way to play is ban threatening geforce now, but if classic is 7.3 based does it mean opengl back supported? (Ofc ive got better asus g752 for games, but nostalgia is tied to the old apple :) )
---
shhhhhh! quiet!
---
...whose wife do you live with??
---
Guild banks were in vanilla, why would people need to check for them?
---
Modern Raid Frames? hell no, #nochanges
---
I see. They want to make all the code moder so its easy to work with and control, basically its like working with hieroglyphics
---
Betamining
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20582/quickness
---
Thanks, I hate it
---
That's was my point:p
---
How do you connect these?
---
It's confirmed that the base client/game updates along with Retail. So I would expect it to be what BFA is.
---
Mine wont be so adequately formatted, but do yall remember the replenishment buff certain dps would give to party members? And it would increase your own buffs effectiveness for having 1 or 2 others activating it with you? It was like some lowkey % mp5 you got for say casting chaos bolt. I think that should come back in classic it felt like a pretty clean mechanic overall.
---
If they did a graphical overhaul but kept it as an optional toggle, that would be awesome.
---
Hell, retail Azeroth could use the graphical overhaul and then it would be assets used wisely
---
They removed legion music from the files as to not make people download unnecessary things. I doubt they would also make you download the new models if there wasn't going to be a toggle.
---
If there's anything i hate more than the new models, it's the new animations. They're way too bouncy and feel off. I hope that this is just clutter in the files since they're using a Legion client.
---
**Blizzard**: How do we announce these changes that will anger the playerbase?
---
**Employee**: What if we just leak it until they come to terms with it?
---
**Blizzard**: GENIUS
---
God I hope so. I'm all for people having the option to relive the game for nostalgia purposes, graphics included, however I would like to play the game over mechanically but with HD graphics. I didn't spend all the money I spent on my PC to play on outdated graphical settings. 
---
A toggle would be great.
---
Let’s see a link pal because I have obsessively peered over every word they’ve ever uttered about classic and see none of that as fact
---
imo, twinstar still got the best vanilla database, and most accurate info. [Quickness](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?spell=20582)
---
db classic have some info missing aswell, few stuff not fully correct, though got the original comments. and overall decent.
---
and classic wowhead doesnt have anything that previous two dont.
---
Just give the nightfall to your offtank, hamstring spam&gt;WF and flurry
---
Extremely logical.  Sadly, logic does not usually work on significant others.
---
Thanks for the invite, you seem like a pretty chill guy! We gotta wait to see how blizzard will handle servers per region, I assume you are NA based? I'm in SA but will play in NA If given the chance. PvP or PvE server?
---
Wand is a physical attack with elemental damage.
---
You are in luck, there are many other food delivery options available these days besides pizza.  Progress!
---
is plains the old durotar/mulgore/westfall music?
---
it's been too long.
---
Selfish bastards!
---
If it's a toggle then they have the choice.
---
They just want other people to enjoy it less

Happy you thottie?

We have google for that
---
Enjoy your piece of artwork tho!
---
sounds like vanilla isnt for you. i wouldnt go to trade chat and starting bitching, unless you just want alot of hate mail to you. no one gives a shit about what your wearing when leveling, and the helm is more of a god tier item over the shoulders anyway.
---
This is the true solution.  You need to build up as many relationship credits as you can.  It is a bit late, but if you start now you might squeeze in enough back rubs and foot massages to last through BWL.
---
Pretty good arguments, actually.
---
The '66 with some quality of life improvements (disk brakes, stereo, suspension and maybe even an engine swap) might prove to be a more appealing thing to the average consumer if given the option. But the "true" experience is a bone stock car (Vanilla). 
---
For the time being, I want to experience Classic as true to Vanilla as it was in terms of how things worked and how the community functioned.
---
After that, I think Blizzard are free to copy Classic once more and start building upon that, 'retro-fitting' various things so that more people would be pulled in. I wouldn't mind an alternate Classic version with transmog, updated graphics, models, spells, etc. Maybe have some expansion spin offs.
---
But we *should* have a 100% pure Vanilla experience with the upcoming Classic gig.
---
Bravo
---
Class: Priest
---
Trained at: Shadow talent that requires at least 20 points in shadow
---
Name: Shadow Nova
---
Mana Cost: 20% base
---
 Range: 10 yards 
---
rank 1: causes an explosion around the caster causing 25-30 shadow damage to all enemy targets and applying shadow word pain (rank 4) to all enemy targets. 
---
can be trained 3 more times at class trainer that would change the shadow damage at the final rank to 99-115 and shadow word pain from rank 4 -&gt; rank 7 at its final stage (rank 8 is final stage of shadow word pain, but shadow nova will only be able to do rank 7 shadow world pain)

---
Unsure if sarcasm but they most definitely were not in vanilla.
---
The first alt leveled in vanilla as a holy paladin was a Hunter, then a druid.
---
Paladin is by far the worst character for doing things in the world other than staying alive forever.
---
Why is this guy claiming to have insider info but won’t reveal it. What a desperate attempt to get more clicks. This kind of behavior should not be tolerated within this community. Complete joke really
---
We'd play on PvP server, but our main focus is PvE content.
---
And yes we're east coast United States.
---
In cases like this the purists end up hurting the game more than helping it. Purists are the reason we still hear talk about wow classic being "all about nostalgia."
---
I think most of us here just want to play a good fucking MMO, and there's not a single one out there right now.
---
Rogues are solid I toyed with the idea of going complete opposite and playing melee I just want sure I wanted to completely jump ship.
---
LOOOOOOL. To take that much of your time to be negative and to come here. Troll or not, you’re the pathetic one here, my guy.
---
How do you come to write this ? Do you think your life is in a better state when you have the idea of writing such an offensive crap about a 13years old game ?
---
Have fun doing what you enjoy in life. I just hope it’s not bullying other people.
---
i'm really concerned about this. not because i don't want a hd model + animation toggle, i could really care less, but i remember in current we used to have a toggle for that too, and it just made the old models look like shit + forced them to use the new animations. is there any point in being worried about this or do you think they'll fix that? i assume they would've fixed it on current if they could, but maybe it was easier to just remove the toggle...?
---
There's one folder called tavernalliance and another called tavernhorde. So my guess is that there's maybe tavern music.
---
That's going to heavily depend on the individual server's economy.
---
Actually I heard they're called clunge caps.
---
graphically not graphically, animations are a part of the feel.
---
I love using things like that tho. #boomer
---
Well I mean we all live our own lives, We all have hobbies, I play video games and world of Warcraft just happens to be my favorite. 
---
You'll be a lot happier once you realize everyone is different.
---
woah there buddy intercept has a 3sec stun, so autoattack, switch overpowered bloodrage ms, 3 hits before your unstunned. this could be death, but likely sub 40%. tbf a good rogue would just gouge you and run away and restealth though no need for cooldowns and shit unless they have to.

But they should have been. 
---
If Blizz could have they would have.
---
It meant less bogging down of the mail system or the need for account-sharing gbank alts
---
IMO there's nothing better to add to classic (other than class revamps) than gbanks to facilitate group organization.
---
"Also downvoting" but yet you're the same lone idiot who said they were going to downvote. Definitely just a nerdo who needs a life.
---
can you sendn us BlizzardInterfaceArt and BlizzardInterfaceCode?
---
Guild banks were most definitely not in vanilla.
---
Any good recommendations or tips for practically a day 1 beginner? I want to learn how to play some simple stuff soon
---
The technical term is beef curtains.
---
Whack a mole in groups, poor ability to solo stuff and no chance in solo pvp compared to a dps spec of the same class.
---
You really have to love group play for it to be worth it. If you plan on mostly soloing, a pure dps class will serve you better.
---
Yeah they should add gbanks for sure as otherwise it will force players to break TOS and account share.
---
Agreed, however I'm sure there are people who like the new ones more so if they have the option to turn them on I really don't care
---
My ass today, it’s been hot as hell!
---
Hope they make it a toggle. That would make everyone happy.
---
In what way is 8.x the Legion client??
---
example of long quest chains? Only can think of 1 which is the duskwood one that has 10-12 parts and imho for the amount of time it takes and travel - doesn't seem worth it.
---
Magical bits
---
It won’t because it won’t happen
---
I'd start with looking at the logo/pic on his video "BETA LEAK!!!..." where it blatantly says "BETA CONFIRMED". That's the first place I'd start. Again, I'm not saying we should hold these folks to the utmost of journalistic standards, I'm just saying with the fan base at peak hype it would be best if everyone would stay level headed and not get carried away with reporting rumors and leaks as 100% confirmed by blizz news.
---
Yeah, my life is pretty pathetic.
---
You were wrong about what you said so not sure how that could be your point but alrighty xd
---
Why the fuck would they expect that?
---
I understand what some people thought. But why is that a reasonable expectation for them to have?
---
 No
---
Did you remember to double the Shaman/Paladin numbers to get a more accurate picture, since they are faction specific?
---
In any case. Demand for raids isn't determined by the number of players. It's determined by the number of players willing to raid *relative to* the number of spots guild offer.
---
Based on my private server experience, I suspect you would have a really hard time getting an Ashkandi in a timely manner. On Alliance, people will want it for pvp. Horde warriors will want it for both pve and pvp. Once AQ40 has been out for a while, some carebear guilds might be willing to sell it for a reasonable price (maybe 1k-2k?). If you can manage to put together some decent dps gear from ZG/AQ20, a pug run + a little luck could also be a good option.  
---
While buying Ashkandi will be tough, I'll bet a Drake Talon Cleaver, Spinal Reaper, or Untamed Blade would be far more attainable.
---
I like that there is no AoE looting because if some Hunter on the opposite faction is tagging and pulling all the raptors I can kill them and they can either loot everything one at a time or fight me.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKkP8LryYM
---
They have, you've been living under a rock seeing it gets posted pretty often. Check classic.wowhead.com and choose "Thottbot theme"
---
They made it so you have to create an account though, fuck em
---
or you know have a report function that goes into the trash bin like most games.
---
didn't the blizzcon demo use old textures on new modoels?
---
I hope they're in progress of stripping it
---
geeeez wiz man
---
or they just forgot to ditch them
---
Zero chance of that happening. They're going to extreme lengths to provide the authentic experience so they're not going to make changes like these.
---
True, there's just such a cultural stigma to gaming vs going out to the bar, even though one of these is infinitely cheaper, and even healthier if you do burpees during your griffon rides
---
I hated when they changed the music in Brill. That weird mix of instruments was great and I always got a kick out of thinking undead sitting around jamming to it.
---
I hate this sub sometimes. Classic team has shown a commitment to keeping the game as faithful to vanilla as possible at every turn. Some files exist in an alpha client that is built on the Legion client and people are, yet again, having a fucking meltdown. Just stop holy shit
---
What I don’t understand is why someone would want to play a HD character when all the NPC’s around you will look textured af lmao, CLASSIC ONLY!
---
No, now I am neutral.
---
As long as I can run the game using the classic models and textures I'll be happy. I don't care if the option for the new models and textures is in the game - in fact, it'd make me happy for all the people who want that - but I want to play Classic as I remember it!
---
Even though it was very expected, this makes me happy as a goblin deviled clam :D
---
no, you don't have a completely free spot as a druid. what you've read is incorrect.
---
what usually ppl say that druid get a free LOOT (not spot) and easier to gear up in raids, compared to all classes, cos there arent many druids in the raid (so its easy to get gear). thats what ppl are refering to.
---
i'd say druid's spots are average in term of competitiveness, not the  most "free", and not the worst.
---
Wasn't there only 1 riding skill in classic and it was the mount that cost 100g/1000g?
---
It is not. You're just a hipster.
---
Holy fuck. I made Orc Females in WoD or some shit just because they had awesome attack animations with melee. My Warrior, DK and Shaman were Orc Females.
---
Than the day of reckoning came and they look poo poo.
---
Druids are able to run away better than the other healers, but they also provide less support than paladins and priests. While I love that movie, and both Wheeliecool and Champ were fantastic players (Illidan Horde represent), they were only able to be successful because they were generally killing total shitters. Had the groups they fought just cc'd the warrior, the druid couldn't have prevented it. Either way, druids are fine for world pvp.
---
Classic.wowhead reads the 1.13 files, it will be the most accurate
---
Dude the run from IF to Menethil was great. It was a serious trek and typically you would do it before you had a mount. You felt like an actual adventurer running through dangerous areas, getting eaten by crocolisks, and it made finally getting that flight path so meaningful.
---
That blank tabbard tells the story of a dead guild, or did you just buy it to hide ugly armor?
---
and end up with 27 copper out of 100g for L40 mount
---
Because upgrading the old client to have all the improvements that the new client has wouldn't be testable by the community because a lot of it goes on behind the scenes. Anti-cheat and stuff like that.
---
If they put vanilla into the modern client we can test it and find the bugs because it'll all be gameplay related.
---
Simple, divorce her and find a girl that plays WoW as much as you or more. I'm living the dream and we're trying to figure out how to tell our kids they're on their own for the summer.
---
I know you are, but what am I?
---
It’s so sad, the worst part is it’s probably not going to change from now on. Especially with allied races it’s way easier to just slap it to the class and have it be the same throughout :(
---
Where did you read that? When I search quickness, I don't even see your version - only 1% dodge.
---
but on classic wowhead it's correct
---
While you make a great point, the amount of time you look at someone else´s model (and I am talking face specifically, everything else is hidden by your gear...even the head if you want it to) is minimal.
---
On the other side, you see your character all the time, either on login screen or in the game (although it´s from the back most of the time, I will grant you that), so I get why people want it to look the way they want.

Hi, /u/thepeoplearestupid
---
Two? 🤣🤣🤣
---
&lt;3 Tips
---
Depends if you wanna play 3 finger bluegrass or the more folly clawhammer. Either way it's all in the right hand. I suggest just going to YouTube and learning Cripple Creek. Jim Pankey is really great if you wanna learn bluegrass first, just YouTube him + cripple Creek.
---
Either way it's gonna take a bit of time to get the right hand down, maybe a few weeks, after that's it's all good! Good luck :)
---
Gnomes are another good example, imo. They really screwed those up
---
Please, tell me, how will existence of HD model change PvP? It´s not like human grows twice in size, they remain the same. All that changes is amount of polygons and facial features. People won´t spot you behind the tree because they have HD models on.
---
No shit?
---
BRILL TAVERN MUSIC WHERE YOU AT?
---
PSA: All the WoW soundtracks are on Spotify. Including one with *just* tavern music.
---
There are some demon hunter files here as well, which leads me to believe they haven't finished scrubbing things they don't intend to have in Classic.
---
UK?
---
Yes it would.
---
Now go back to pservers, thanks.
---
Oh yeah my b, it’s been awhile haha
---
I like the dreamwalk idea, but it would be OP af. I'd just have it be 10 secs like a pally bubble, phases you out of the world and immobilizes you and heals you to full. 
---
Basically a pally bubble but maybe make it require like 30% mana
---
And players that use them get banned for 2 weeks.  (This just recently happened)
---
Male nelf anything
---
Bald human male mage
---
It was 2 riding skill levels. 75 and 150.
---
75 allows you to use 60% mounts, and costs 90 g for skill training and 10g for mount.
---
150 allows you to use any mount, till 100% speed. Costs 900g for training skill and 100g for mount.  all prices without discount. You can get discount for reputation level and one more discount for PvP rank.
---
It’s not too tough a grind! Running the scarlet monastery several times and selling cloth is an easy way to get good cash drops and stuff to sell. 
---
Only wear quest rewards or bop drops and you will have plenty of gold at forty for your mount.
---
I think the issue is that people will be seeing completely different textures not so much whether or not it’s HD. I would personally prefer to ONLY have HD textures if they’re going to be on a toggle anyway. I mean, I would prefer just the original everything but if we’re going to have HD textures make everyone have it not toggle it because then we get into different people looking at different textures which I think could be problematic in certain instances with gameplay and especially immersion.

&gt; They just need dynamic respawns.
---
Congratulations. Mages can now AOE grind to 60 in like 72 hours.
---
How so? Why not discuss your opinion instead of dismissing the idea rudely?
---
Really? What did you buy it at?
---
The problem is that what they consider a problem was enough for them to justify fucking over everyone else who didn't think it was a problem. 
---
That's the case in 90% of Blizz decisions which other players don't like. I've never seen them "fix" something without pissing off a bunch of other players. 
---
They always always go with the solution that compromises a bunch of their player base. 
---
What they should have done is for every expansion a player buys they can start at that expansion's start on a fresh character. 
---
If somebody pays for BC and Wrath, them guys Data, they can start chars at 58 for BC, 68 for Wrath, and 78 for Data. 
---
This way they don't have to change things. 
---
I'm sure you'd have some Whiners complaining that they had to level up a char but people complaining about the game is something Blizz ignores routinely so there's no reason to cater to somebody upset because they leveled their gnome during Vanilla.
---
Hi, /u/OGRiceness
---
I would prefer no macros and no add ons, the harder it is, the more valuable everything is.
---
Guild banks would be nice. Having a bank character on someone's account is a crappy solution with no positive aspects.
---
The folks that work at blizz now aren't the same as the ones that made wow 20 years ago. The players arent the same either. The ones that liked old wow long since stopped playing.
---
I had to come back for another daily laugh my ass off
---
this is the greatest meme with the most background
---
I think you interpreted the data wrong. There are more Druids ***in total*** than both Shamans and Paladins because Druids appear on two factions. However, their number per faction is lower ; there are less Horde Druid than Shamans, and less Alliance Druid than Paladins, be it according to this survey posted on Reddit :  
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b4wz4u/distribution\_of\_race\_and\_class\_according\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b4wz4u/distribution_of_race_and_class_according_to/)  
---
Horde : 8.10% Druids , 14.41% Shamans (over 70% more Shamans than Druids)
---
Alliance : 9.89 % Druids , 13.86% Paladins (about 40% more Paladins than Druids)
---
I just checked how it looks like on the biggest current classic Pserv and it's even more disproportionate, with about 2 times more Paladins/Shamans than Druids on each faction. 
---
So no, finding a raid spot as a Druid will most probably be easier. Also, if you go Heart of the Wild + Resto spec you'll have a way easier time doing stuff outside of raids (grinding, soloing, farming, tanking dungeons ...) than healing Paladins / Shamans. Really, really easier time.
---
Classic is being built with 7.3.5 engine.

15% physical. Zero magic reduction.
---
Hey man, I can't be held responsible for accidentally posting song lyrics. I won't be held responsible, you noticed the lyrics in the first place.
---
They kept nerfing the game and making it easier, raids were nerfed after launch. Personally I never raided pre-nerf though. They made gear easier to get so people could start raiding faster. Still better than LFR but a lot of dumb people who never raided before went right to ICC because they were "geared" for it (or almost there). Most could do wing 1 but by wing 2 (plague wing) they were fucked. They refused to listen to instructions because everything up until that point was easy.
---
I did practice Vanilla and TBC raids with actual dedicated groups because I thought raiding was fun and I wasn't max level to try out the real thing yet. Also did Nax and Ulduar before I did icecrown.
---
That's because they are using the modern client - as everyone already knows
---
That last line is kinda lame. Those "risk" type of spells only make sense for locks/mages who use unstable magics.
---
I'd say make it a group rez with a 30m CD. So you get one or two rezzes per dungeon
---
You have to get out of shadow to heal, but u can power word shield while in shadow form.
---
The math on those polls are wrong. You need to add shaman and paladin numbers or divide all other classes into horde and alliance. There never was a server with more druids than shamans or paladin it is only faulty math spread wide and far by youtubers. Flavour of the month may also explain the poll.
---
Druids and shamans are both healers and that is the role most guilds have a hard time to consistently fill. Druids suffer from the hybrid tax way more than shaman. I would still say go with the druid they are super fun even if shamans are a little better at end game pvp and pve content.
---
I completely agree
---
Counter point:
---
    If they made theirs in HD, would you want to see it the way they made it in your low-rez world?  No, because that would be stupid.  If they want to see it one way, it shouldn't matter to you.
---
    You don't actually look to me the way you think you look to you.  Peoples' perceptions are different.  You don't see the same color red that I do.
---
    Why should you care if I view everything in HD or not?  You shouldn't.  You're just being controlling and silly.
---
Gives something to do for 10 minutes while I eat a meal
---
Is that all even with talents? I was thinking it was closer to 40% physical?
---
I said private servers rock more than a million players total. As in those players will probably migrate en masse to official servers.
---
You either thought I was the OP, or you misunderstood my post.
---
I think semi deep into holy you can get 10% magic resist but it's far enough to be icky to do
---
HD yes! 2019 graphics forma Vanilla!
---
40% is soul link warlock with voidwalker
---
But they are stripping out components they are not using. So the fact these are still there is interesting at the very least.
---
Dont know anything about that. I cant imagine the need for jump potions in wow the way it is now. You can go from nothing to max in the blink of an eye now.  The jump pots would only be useful if you hated leveling AND they reverted all the stat crushing and xp nerfing back to the way things were when wow was fun to play.
---
It's not the same.
---
Exactly my idea; I created a post earlier about it and was rudely answered by some @Jacksinthe. Guild Banks would be a great thing in Vanilla. An environment with plenty of consumables.
---
Imagine if you would a world where you go into the barrens and the mobs are all level 55 because that's what level you are.  That's the world we live in.  Content scales to your current level and is all tuned to a certain 'difficulty'.. you can't really call it a difficulty because the world is not dangerous at all.. it's tuned to a certain 'easyness level' i guess would be more accurate.  
---
Imagine a world when leveling from 110 to 120 your character becomes less powerful when compared to the world.  It takes longer to kill the same monster then it did a level ago.  And this scaling continues as your item level increases at 120.  So when you get more powerful gear the monsters in the world are harder to kill as well.  Now, the monster scaling isn't as sharp as your loot scaling so eventually you will feel strong, but at early gear increases you can't even notice that you are getting stronger because everything is more difficult to kill!  
---
That's the world of warcraft we live in now.
---
Play mage. Mages look like homeless people in  their BiS gear until T3, so does not really matter if you look like a proper or midget size beggar.
---
"Unless they introduce classic WoW elements slowly/one-at-a-time, the amount of pro-classic players that could return will likely equal the amount of modern-day players who would leave due to them being used to the changes of the previous 5 expansions."
---
If that's the case they should definitely go back to the old ways of doing things. Because as it is now every expansion they get newbs who then get pissed one or two expansions later and quit. 
---
At least if they went back to the older ways of doing things they'd be catering to their original players. I'm sure they'd get a bunch more too because in terms of "quality of life" and "convenience over consequences" WoW is just like every other MMORPG.
---
HAHAHAHAHA this is my best friend.
---
He did this shit the entire time
---
Definitely feels like the average age of this sub is quite a bit higher than r/wow or r/wowservers.
---
My cereal bowl
---
It's a huge difference
---
What happened?
---
This is correct
---
Druid
---
Trained at: 32-point Balance (31-point row but requires Moonkin Form)
---
Type: Passive
---
Improved Moonkin Form (Rank 1): Each time you hit critically with Wrath or Starfire, you have a 35% chance to restore mana equal to 25% of the damage done. Additionally, reduces the mana cost of your Moonkin Form by 50%.
---
Improved Moonkin Form (Rank 2): Each time you hit critically with Wrath or Starfire, you have a 65% chance to restore mana equal to 25% of the damage done. Additionally, your Moonkin Form costs no mana.
---
Improved Moonkin Form (Rank 2): Each time you hit critically with Wrath or Starfire, you have a 100% chance to restore mana equal to 25% of the damage done. Additionally, your Moonkin Form costs no mana and causes mana to regenerate while casting for 5 seconds.
---
Trained at: 21-point Balance
---
Vitality (Rank 1): Each time you cast any Balance spell, your mana will regenerate at 10% rate while casting, for 5 seconds. This stacks with Reflection.
---
Vitality (Rank 1): Each time you cast any Balance spell, your mana will regenerate at 20% rate while casting, for 5 seconds. This stacks with Reflection.
---
Vitality (Rank 1): Each time you cast any Balance spell, your mana will regenerate at 30% rate while casting, for 5 seconds. This stacks with Reflection.
---
man they did such a good job with this.
---
Fuck sakes. BLIZZARD GIVE IT TO US BY SUMMER
---
This was such a huge part of the game for me leveling with just 5 real life friends. We all had so many alts at different levels that we would hang out on voice chat and quest and run each other through. "Oh you got dungeon quests? I'll hop on my 60 warrior and run you through." Those were the best days.
---
Garrote then blind?
---
Given how much time they spent at blizzcon explaining how they wanted to get the shade of lantern lights exactly the way they looked in vanilla, I think it's a reasonable assumption that they won't deviate from this design approach in an infinitely more noticeable area like character models/animations.
---
LMFAO
---
They don't have to strip of anything. There's probably a metric ton of unused, not working garbage in the current client, too. Coffee that doesn't work so it's commented, audio that isn't being used, etc. It could also be a holdover from testing.
---
That's game development.
---
Because they've already been discussed about 9.8 quintillion times. We don't need another thread.
---
Learn how to use the search.
---
With no professions it’s still easy. Buy absolutely nothing but your essential skills and loot / sell everything. Invest in at least 12 slot bags. You’ll have 150g ish at 40.
---
The constant denial and jealousy was pretty bad in r/wow when vanilla was first announced. I've seen how some of these new players play the game and played the beta. They legit do not want a challenge. They want a brainless button-masher. This is the group blizzard catered halfway through Wrath (I still fucking love wrath) and then continued to with cata when they didn't have to, long after every other competing mmo was dead. Their subs reflect this decision.
---
That's close, but really zones will scale in a range.  If you go to a starting zone it wont scale up to your level 40.  Each zone has a level range they will scale to.

---
ooh this one still works. I remember so much this UI
---
i like shadowpanther for rogue
---
I do like having updated models. I haven't played wow since BC end. I recently started messing around on the free test account and was pleasantly surprised at how crisp the characters looked.
---
You didn't get very far into the game at all...
---
No, you said *vanilla* private servers rock more than a million players total, which isn't true. Check your post.
---
Yes mate, bbq is lit and drinks are flowing.
---
That's a mistake on the wiki page, not from the actual data.
---
Also, I see Retail racials there.
---
He got the views and ads he wanted, so not sorry at all lol.
---
This is why the game has gone off the deep end.  If you look at each convenient change isolated it makes sense "Oh i can level without spending 80% of my time walking to an appropriate zone.", yeah but you also took the danger out of the world and you took out any sense of progression at the same time.  All the changes together add up to a game that isn't interesting or compelling to level in.
---
\&gt;  he doesn't have to scream every 3.5 seconds to keep your attention 
---
Cries in Preach
---
Bluegrass of course! I respect the old time style but it seems like there's so much more you can do with Bluegrass. Thanks for the info, I'll go check that out!
---
Got some proof to back up that claim?
---
It's almost impossible to say. Without knowing specifics about Blizzard's plans internally, no one can really guess with any real accuracy. It could be they aren't planning on doing a large beta test and thus nothing prevents Classic from releasing in the next couple months. Or maybe this is just the first of many alpha phases before moving onto an extended beta phase.
---
We just don't know.
---
He has almost 6k HP which is huge for a newer lvl 60 that is farming money. Its possible but you will need to do smaller pulls.
---
yeah this set of servers should be the museum. 
---
But if it proves to be popular, and blizzard doesnt want to push to classic bc. A vanilla + server could be cool. where the community + blizzard comes up with features that could improve, but not break the classic feel. then every reroll, there is a new iteration. 
---
say vanilla +1 is removal of debuff cap and adjustment of mob (especially raid mob/boss) health.  vanilla +2 guild banks, modern textures/shaders, etc.
---
That said, Im not sold on tmog, maybe for yourself, but on a pvp server that lets me know how geared you are (since you cant look at enemy hp). If its an ally its that whole envy/aspiration/goal thing.
---
says the guy who doesn't understand simple posts
---
Without knowledge of Blizzard's internal plans/schedule, all you can really say is that the alpha phase(s) will likely come before beta phase(s) before releasing. Attaching specific meanings beyond that is almost entirely wild speculation.
---
His very first character, not his most played.
---
I think everyone vision of the world ought to be he same.  The old wow designers adhered to fantasy novel/game principles without worrying too much about gimmicky features like this.  
---
For example:. A sitting player should be critical striked in melee because they're vulnerable.
---
I don't see any fantasy explanation for having toggleable player models.
---
That was months ago. This version has been upgraded to the current client
---
But there's no other characters...
---
Cleared most of naxx back in the day so yeah its for me and I remember the rules.
---
I'd really like that. I want vanilla gameplay, not vanilla models.
---
Calls me child for saying final. Then says final. I see you're ARE an idiot.
---
I can't answer that because it wasn't something I expected either, but I do find it interesting (in a good way) that many of us are now so confident that things like this will not be changed that we don't even consider it reasonable to wonder about. We've come a long way since all the suspicion and doubts early on.
---
I personally enjoy the vanilla graphics. New doesn't mean better, but for some it will.
---
I just hope they won't compromise with old models at all. Animations needs to be OG if you wanna play the OG models.
---
That'd be great with the dx12 optimizations.
---
Do you have a source on that?
---
Exactly, a toggle has the ability to give everyone what they want.
---
"Normies"
---
I bet this guy is a Trump supporter... yup
---
Gnomes are subhuman scum.
---
New animations personally ruin wow for me, I agree. They feel more "look how animated we can make models" rather than making something that fits the game.
---
You should be able to find it in one of the threads on this sub from the last couple of days. It was fairly widespread knowledge.
---
Alright here we go:
---
Class: mage
---
Name: Arcane burst
---
Cast time: 4s
---
Mana cost: a lot.
---
Deals &lt;a lot&gt; arcane damage. Generates extra threat for no reason at all.
---
Simple, sounds good, yet one little detail keeps it from being actually good. Makes bwl a lot funnier for tanks. Very vanilla-like.
---
I may be one of these old and grumpy vanilla players but I don't want HD models or animations in a remake that's all about vanilla and that's supposed to be nostalgic. Toggled client-side...maybe, I don't know. 
---
I believe Blizzard either make a vanilla game as if they were to release WoW today. Updated graphics, aesthetics, zones, models, environments, animations, everything. Imagine what Barrens would look like if the released WoW today. I think that's an interesting concept on its own.
---
Else, I think they should go full-on Classic. Some necessary QoL improvements, which they are doing, is appreciated. Other than that it should be as close as it possibly can.
---
It's a controversial topic, there's really no right or wrong and it's impossible to satisfy everyone.
---
An oldie but goodie.
---
Every quest, mob and doodad could potentially be broken or out of place based on how they presented how they’re making classic at blizzcon. We don’t know exactly how broken everything was after they ported vanilla into 7.3.5 but there’s no evidence to support the idea that it’ll be fast to fix it all.
---
Use New HD models and animations and i seriously would say fuck this. That aint Classic and i want nothing to do with it. Vanilla models and animations are so important. Cant stand the New animations and models
---
They just added comments to classic wowhead all the way back to 2006 before the tbc launch.
---
That was ironic. Did you seriously not get that? Dear lord.
---
This is the real world equivalent to "everyone thinks I'm an asshole cause I speak my mind" guess what that makes you an asshole.
---
If you didn't know about these, you should lose your 'Ultimate Blizzard Fanboy' card and not be allowed to play classic.
---
[Found it](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/beeruz/classic_will_run_on_the_8x_client_as_a_foundation/). This is pretty awesome tbh, it's not like the game is super heavy but better cpu optimizations are always welcome.
---
Rogue. 
---
Ability Name: Disguise
---
Ability Effect: Target a player or NPC with a race that players can choose. Your race becomes that players race. You don't appear hostile to members of that faction or players in your party or raid. Other members of your original faction see you as hostile if you transform into a race of the opposing faction.
---
Notes:.   
---
A player with a discerning eye could notice you using weapons that are typically seen by the other faction or quests rewards that are actually faction locked.
---
Lucky is a relative term; they would have saved me from buying Cata.
---
PvP question. 
---
Back in the day i got people logging alts or going on thw forum complaining that they got ganked or pkd by me, yes occasionally there was some corpse camping. 
---
Back then taking a rez sickness cost a lot so people would contact me telling me i was reported many times.
---
I am 99% sure gms got these tickets so what was your response to these and were there any extreme cases where you had to step in?? Also what was your opinion on such behaviour on pvp servers.
---
You're equating mechanics with cosmetics there.
---
The above example makes sense, but models with updated textures have no impact on mechanics, as the model skeletons and hitboxes haven't been altered.
---
That said, it is all personal preference. I think Blizzard want to appeal to as many as possible by including an off-by-default HD texture pack.
---
War Druid was a really strong common starting tbc. Before that it was less epic. Yes put a healer with a warrior and you’ll be damn fine, especially a Druid with the overall evade, but the warrior has less synergy.
---
I will probably level faster as alliance than horde because I have the memories of lvling in elwynn westfall duskwood all engraved in my brain, stranglethorn was hell due to higher level horde camping. Level early and avoid getting camped will be the motto in classic i think.
---
OK, lol. Fair enough.
---
&gt;They just added comments to classic wowhead all the way back to 2006 before the tbc launch
---
Pity they haven't added items from thottbot.
---
I mean, 90% of the database is missing.
---
that's a good point. i was just concerned because they've tried this before and it didn't work, but when you put it that way i don't think this would be the hill they die on. thanks for the reassurance
---
Mining takes to much time to keep up with. Also, mining is very very popular so it's just not worth it if you are apart of the zerg. Herbs are more prevelant and not as contested.
---
Nice.
---
It's only immersion breaking if you keep getting tossed between different shards, hopefully that doesn't happen, we don't really know how the technology works or how it can be configured
---
They released d3.
---
Fair point, I fucked up that one. Still, there's a solid amount of Vanilla private servers out there. I looked more closely at the most popular servers etc and Vanilla/TBC seem to be all the rage, with a bit of WotLK sprinkled in.
---
While I was definitely wrong about the count, I stand by my point that there's probably going to be a huge influx of people from private servers, several hundred thousand most likely, though it'll be interesting to see if they can be *retained* over time or if they'll get bored and quite/go private again.
---
They look great on orcs
---
I just sat at the west ham game, hanging out my ass in that sun and I legit feel like ive got resurrection sickness
---
Yeah the melee/caster conflict has been real for me. Caster would give me a mostly all new experience, but I think I'll just end up wishing I could ambush people. Sounds like you'll have a great time regardless, but I am bias toward Locks because of their demonic background.
---
I work at least half the weekends, but days off during the week are worth it!
---
100g can be turned down to around 90g in total via some rep. You should have enough rep from questing and also you may do the cloth turn in if more rep needed.
---
As for rep - you get the rep to some of your faction sub-factions based on quest giver and/or zone. If you roll dwarf you will want to not miss dwarf-NPC quest givers to be on top with the rep.
---
?you will not have 150 g
---
Never would have guessed
---
Barrens music replaced with Old town road
---
Cats, gorillas and basilisks in stv give good gold. Dont learn unnecessary spells.
---
It won’t at all, but the dumbass #NoChanges inquisition has to ruin everyone else’s fun.
---
I did not know you could fish in lava, what can you get from lava fishing?
---
I have leveled like 15 characters to 60. I’ve never had less than 150g at 40. During retail vanilla, private servers, etc. and that’s without professions. If I take skinning / herb or mining / herb at the start of a new server and level fast you can have about 300-350 at 40 easily. You just don’t buy anything at all, get food / water from a mage if you aren’t one, pick up every item and sell them, use the AH for greens etc. You will have more have more than enough for a mount I assure you.
---
oh no no no hahaha

Hurricane was a pretty useless spell in vanilla so I thought I’d spice it up
---
21 point balance talent 
---
Blinding Winds
---
Targets affected by your hurricane suffer a -10% chance to hit with all attack’s and spells and have their movement speed is lowered by 25%
---
Thank you for saying this. I've been telling friends for years now that the new models have visual issues. Undead and Trolls still have shoulder positioning issues, Taurens have stretched cloaks, and Troll Females have a very wonky run animation. They never saw/believed it though. Happy to know I'm not crazy.
---
In all seriousness mate, if you start to feel cold seek help. Sunstroke is a bitch! Wouldn’t wish it on an Alliance.
---
There was only room for a single shadow priest in vanilla raids, so unless you've got that slot locked down I'd recommend running holy.
---
Thanks for the concern fellow brit.enjoy your Easter weekend mate!

The painting shows Jupiter occult by one of its moons. Io is that small dot while the big moon looks like of one icy ones - Europa, Ganymede or Callisto. Europa-Ganymede orbits are close while Callisto is further away... so it could be that Azeroth is actually Ganymede or someone from Stratholme was on Ganymede :)
---
Everyone in this thread has apparently already forgotten that the Classic demo had the old models. Dunno why they assume that it would be changed...
---
And you bud!!
---
BONE!!! 
---
How DARE YOU,  DETECTIVE DIAZ. I AM YOUR SUPERIOR OFFICER!
---
Rent Free.
---
But really, I was using the word ever since I was on team Bernie 2016. Don’t project, yo.
---
Exactly! Blizzard definitely wants Classic WoW to be very low maintenance so if they use the modern backend code, everything is more stable. And any future improvements can also be applied to Classic WoW too, so it won’t get outdated.
---
you could fish from lave or even patches of water before chromagus. It required highly boosted fishing skill while it's not perfectly clear what it did drop during vanilla as various wiki sources seems to differ with time. Some list some useless fishes, some list some fire-alike resources dropping from the lava fishing.
---
The amount of time I look at other people's faces (especially the face!) is incredibly high though, after all the portrait is in the default group-ui.
---
On top of that, one of the most popular Vanilla interface addons is "Luna", which has ANIMATED portraits. Most Classic WoW streamers use it in their videos, I'm sure people have seen it before.
---
So if I'm in a group with Rapeface Dwarf I will see his disturbing face on the left of my screen - and it will be amazing. Disturbing, but amazing.
---
Seriously, people should not underestimate how those little things will affect your gaming experience. Hell, yesterday I played on a private realm and the group talked for 10 minutes about the funky name of the Warlock's IMP.
---
I mean if I'm in the minority here and people want those HD models so bad and Blizzard listens, then so be it. But the argument "a toggle wont affect you" is simply not true.
---
News flash, you can log onto WoW without a sub. You don't need to be in Boralus to look at the sky and check a clock. I'm "rude" because ignorance is rampant and it's not showing signs of slowing down.
---

Do you seriously not get that a lvl 37 shaman has no fucking god damn right rolling need on herod's shoulders over a lvl 37 warrior? Dear lord you're fucking hopeless. PLEASE tell me you're not playing a shaman come classic, and if so, tell me which server so I know which one to NOT roll on.
---
I actually think gnomes look sick in plate gear. Makes them look all girthy and bad-ass. They looks pretty wack in leather/cloth tho.
---
there's a ton of unused files. no wod models in demo, no wod models in the current alpha and thank god for that
---
&gt;have stopped playing 
---
Moreso because the game stopped being good in their eyes, than because their enjoyment of the game just vanished. Me and many others would absolutely still play live WoW if we thought it was a good game that still was an mmorpg. 
---
And I know the creators are by and large gone. Which is why I think they shouldn’t reinvent Classic or try and replicate a past greatness, but instead, put the game in a state where it can *move on* from the rut it’s in. Whether that’s a game changing 9.0, or WoW 2, maybe World of Diablo, I don’t know.
---
Don't retail Orcs stand fully upright now, instead of hunching over? That's a pretty major difference. But back when the updated models first came out, I remember there being some fairly noticeable differences in terms of build. Height was generally consistent, but things like shoulder width changed more noticeably.
---
The bigger issue is animations. If you think your arms are sticking close to your body and it turns out you're actually waving them around above your head, that's an issue. Hell, even simple things like wilder/more erratic motions can affect gameplay, because they draw the eye and are thus more noticeable at a distance.
---
I don’t get why people are going nuts to get invites to the beta. If you’re really salivating at the mouth go play on a pserver.
---
It’s going to be the same game you played in 2004. The community is what makes the game, and you’re not going to get that in a beta.
---
Look up the definition of summer before you make these claims about what is “off”. 
---
Despite what the majority of the sub seems to believe, August release is still more probable than anything.
---
http://lmgtfy.com/?q=last+day+of+summer
---
I really don't think they do want to appeal to everyone.  It is a mechanic that I've brought up, but the principle extends.
---
Anyways, I'm really just making up arguments for my stance on the matter, but now that the thought's crossed my mind, I wouldn't mind if they went further with it.
---
Jumping into water should nullify fire effects, and stuff like that.  But that'll never happen.
---
&gt;This is the group blizzard catered halfway through Wrath (I still fucking love wrath)
---
that's why re-releaseing original content up to Wrath is a NO.
---
Either stop in vanilla, or in TBC. I'd prefer in vanilla.
---
Instead of sacrificing the pet just get the pets ability
---
The comic-like graphic of WoW has always been ridiculed by its MMORPG predecessors and other modern "realistic" looking MMORPGs. As the graphics were updated it was only natural for more ability animations to look more comic-like, just as it did back then - the difference being the modern animations are very very expressive. Best example being Whirlwind.
---
It’s absolutely not worth it just to get the mount at 40. Just do what everyone else does and wait until 43/44 when quest rewards are so valuable that you’ll have 100g anyway.
---
The community is what makes the game?
---
Careful you don't say that too loudly, the the private server hopping fun seeking Community might hear you. Kek.
---
Or there will be an accelerated beta. You gotta remember that this game was already played for 2+ years. They have a running log of almost all the exploits and know how to re-create them.
---
I’m sure the beta will mostly be for stress testing.
---
I  remember some mobs requiring like 315 skinning. 315 was the maximum you could get, with like one +10 item and one +5 enchant.
---
So people aren’t confused, unless you have a lot of +healing gear, usually only at 60, it is still more efficient to use the highest rank of heals and only heal when the tank is low. Down ranking only improves “hp per mana” when you have +healing items.
---
How old is your son?

Shadow is fine for leveling, dungeons, and definitely PvP. Once you start raiding, most raids will *want* just one shadow priest because it boosts the warlock damage. However, if you're in a casual guild the chances are good that they're just going to be filling spots with whoever is around. People on this sub tend to forget that most guilds in vanilla didn't progress much through the raid content and that casual guilds struggled to get full raid groups together. 
---
If you're playing shadow because that's what you'll enjoy, then do it. Vanilla is too long a game to suffer through as something you don't really want to do. But if you're up for holy, then you might find it easier to get into the raid content (and PvP healing is a ton of fun in my opinion). Also note that your leveling will be as efficient in holy as it is in shadow, so focus on whichever makes you happy.
---
Or he got kicked because he hasn't logged on in 14 years..
---
Are you in a guild called &lt;makaveli&gt;?
---
Is this satire?
---
Skinning beast in badlands (around level 35) when it started yielding me top coin. Badlands is a perfect spot to grind for your mount, even the junk sells good. Also rock elementals, lesser (near kargath) greater (near grotto) can be great substitute.
---
That’s awesome.  GM’s were a lot more interactive back in vanilla.  I remember seeing a few in person; and one account (I was being stupid on with hacking exploration) they permanently put my character to sleep so I couldn’t move, then briefly talked to me and my friend before perma banning us.
---
You are correct. I’ve updated my post to clarify.
---
It has been! They said it will be used at launch for the first couple zones for each faction.
---
With fishing you have the aquadynamic lure plus fishing rods with bonus fishing. You needed a rod + that lure to fish water in Azshara or bit less for Mudskunk in ZG. It's more inflated than mining or skinning.
---
You bitch too much.
---
I never claimed that resistance gear was necessary for all of those fights, but rather that those encounters involved elemental attacks, some of which could be resisted through gear and/or potions.
---
I hope it is, i have always wanted to be apart of a raid that does that
---
Holy cow this was amazing. Thanks for posting this!
---
Their friends can join them with a lower level alt. If you lower the standard for newcomers, the progress of hardcore raiders becomes meaningless. I am not hardcore in any way, but I struggled to get to 60, for untimatly nothing. One of the addicting things about wow is that every small thing you do gets rewarded, discover a new zone, collect hooves, even pick up grey items and sell them. You do all that, feel you progressed and then with the expansion the standard is lower and it feels it was all for nothing. So why would you start even doing all that when you know that by next expansion it is worthless.
---
As a newcomer I always saw these higher tier gear as something to look up to, to respect. I thought ofcoarse that if I would put a lot of effect and time in it, and find a good guild, I could have a chance aswell to get it. But I didn't want to go that far, I would just walk trough Ogrimmar and inspect all the cool guys. You knew how much effort it took to get it and that is what it represented.
---
I did much the same as you. I played a ton through Wrath and a little bit during Cata and MoP, then quit. When I originally heard that they were releasing Classic I didn't think anything of it, but recently I've started to feel the vanilla itch. So much nostalgia!
---
Even though you're alliance scum, I enjoyed looking through your screenshots. I never considered MCing the opposition leadership. New goal in Classic!

---
A toggle would NOT be great. Two separate clients like sunwell's wotlk server had would be great. If you toggle off the new models on live currently, you get disfigured, cross eyed faces. Most of us don't want that on our models.
---
Biggest difference is that vanilla night was DARK. current night the sky is just dark... You can still see everything around you as if it wasn't night time.

He's 14.  I remember MC was a guild killer on my med pop server because of the difficulty getting 40 consistent raiders.  I also remember everything being easy till cthun with 30-40 competent people.  Maybe I'll enjoy healing again, it's a hard thing to do without a farming alt though, and with how much I enjoyed pvping as shadow.
---
There are tons of factors, and, while they haven't ever come out and said, "here's why," we can guess based on what other software companies *have* said:
---
- Like you said, it gives them time to fix urgent bugs
---
- Tuesdays are, many times, a time in the week where people aren't playing games as much as other times in the week, so maintenance/releases are less stressful.
---
- Tradition; Blizzard has done Tuesday releases/maintenance for over a decade, now, and they've got the pattern down pat. Why would Blizzard want to change from a known formula that works for them? Changing anything, like releasing on a Thursday, might introduce problems that they didn't know about before, especially for such a big release as this.
---
- Weekend releases (Thursdays partially included) are really unstable given time zones, as you have some people where it's Saturday for them, some people where it's Thursday. By releasing on a Thursday in the US, you're inherently giving some people more of a weekend launch, and thus more time to play, than others. While this may not be a huge catalyst for Tuesday releases, it might factor into the decision somewhat.
---
I got your point.
---
As have everyone else.
---
Look at the scores of your posts, no-one agrees with you.
---
I "like seriously get what you're saying" but as I've explained in detail these are only your childish feelings of fairness. You can huff and puff all you want but like all children throwing tantrums it doesn't do you any good. The adults are laughing. Goodbye.
---
jokes on you i love the grind
---
&gt; That's the case in 90% of Blizz decisions which other players don't like. I've never seen them "fix" something without pissing off a bunch of other players.
---
Because usually it's impossible.
---
You dont typically reveal your sources if you're not suppose to have that information in the first place.
---
What about stuff like armour rating from inner fire plus your cloth stuff.
---
I thought it's kind of, since it's a shadow spell. Kind of maybe, but attunement is probably more fitting.
---
I'm learning toward horde on classic, so I'm playing alliance right now on private servers. Different quests, different zones, even playing a class I definitely won't play on classic.
---
Not telling you what to do, but there are definitely ways to whet your appetite, refresh yourself a bit on the game, and still not ruin the actual launch for yourself.
---
Aah, when you finally got your first shoulders 😂 Felt amazing.
---
&gt; The old wow designers adhered to fantasy novel/game principles without worrying too much about gimmicky features like this. 
---
Yet the game was for a long time since its release ridiculed for it comic-esque art style, often even today.
---
&gt; I don't see any fantasy explanation for having toggleable player models. 
---
Then the toggle for head pieces should be removed as well, as in lore only really mages can change their appearances and of course demons. A proper "fantasy explanation" for anyone to toggle their appearances off or on was only implemented during Cata with the transmogification system offered by the Ethereals.
---
Oh, sure, but they may have aimed for a July launch, and then had to push it way back. We don't know what's going on behind the scenes. While I don't think we'll actually get a September launch, it's the last month where they can push to for quality reasons, and still say, "see? We told you summer!" Besides, that's just following their BFA alpha/beta/release schedule, and doesn't mean that it applies to Classic's schedule. They may change up the lengths of each step in the release cycle to get an earlier launch date, we don't know. My post wasn't a, "we're getting it in September" prediction, it was just a, "here's what would happen if they used BFA's launch schedule for Classic," comparison.
---
This is equivalent to restoring an ancient artifact.... you are destroying its value. Vanilla belongs in a museum and should be purely vanilla.
---
&gt; So no, finding a raid spot as a Druid will most probably be easier.
---
I donno. 8% druids and 14.4% Shamans but a raid want 1-3 druids (2.5-7.5%) and 6-8 shamans (15-20%).
---
The new animations are horrible.
---
Every warrior uses the same whirlwind animation
---
and every 1H user has the same back-swing uppercut. I hope theyre going to leave the new animations out.
---
Worth noting that if models are still in but they managed to prune all non classic music, for some reason, then it probably means they're still considering using them.
---
I think they should make toggle for every specific race. Like I want to make only dwarfs look HD. Although, wonder what happens to the new/old animations.
---
Be the change you wish to see in the world.
---
14 is a good age for vanilla.
---
Depending on the time you can invest, you might be able to farm enough as shadow during the week to justify the respec cost. Likely, though, you'll not be able to make enough to absorb the 100g weekly cost of shadow-&gt;holy-&gt;shadow. Don't forget you can do some reasonable farming with Holy Nova once you get a bit of gear. Not as good as high DPS classes, of course, but you have options. Especially if you pick up a gathering profession or two. 
---
But if you enjoy shadow, then do it. You'll be able to get a spot in a casual guild.
---
I hate not knowing where to go. It's why I hated dark souls. 
---
:(
---
Yup, I loved Spy. Wonderful addon. And the nice thing is that it detected EVERYTHING. Someone sits down to eat or drink... Detected. Go into stealth... Detected. Anything that results in a log entry... Detected.
---
He's getting downvoted because of his lack of user empathy. In reality, it doesn't matter how clear YOU think your messaging is. If the customer is missing the point, YOU have failed and need to work on communicating better. If people are unclear on what's happening, it doesn't matter what Blizz has done, clearly they're doing it wrong and can do better.
---
You absolutely can do that as a resto shaman,
---
it was dogshit.
---
Some people are bothered that with the differnt type of models toggled their character would look shitty from the perspective of other players.
---
Not OP, but I was a GM in Vanilla and TBC.  If you're on a PVP server there is no rule against ganking, stalking, corpse camping, etc.  The guidance given to us was to advise the player that there is a "PVP Solution".  Basically get some friends to help.
---
That is very interesting. When I started in vanilla I never knew you could do lava fishing and I fished a lot.
---
Do you think this will be a thing in classic wow?
---
I guess you have to win the STV fishing extravaganza for that fishing pole and boost fishing further?
---
If they didn't worry about supersition, then why can't you find the 13th floor in many skyscrapers? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_floor
---
Yes, it's silly, but then, so is thinking that ghosts are real, and yet it's a massive industry come Halloween, or "mediums" that make people believe they can speak with the dead. I'm not saying the 13th anniversary is something that *will* be avoided, I'm just saying that it's not likely to be celebrated as big as releasing Classic on that day because of it.
---
Stunning and brave.
---
Omg lol you really ARE a fucking child. The good old I have more upvotes so I’m right argument! Omfg so a positive score on a pro murder comment makes it right? Fuuuuuuck
---
It means they have actively removed game assets from the client. This is relevant.
---
Let's say you told someone who is really ugly that they're ugly. Or if you told someone who was really stupid that they're an idiot. Or that you told someone really weak that they're weak. 
---
Can you not see how at a certain point that could be hateful? Especially if they weren't asking for criticism at the time?
---
There's no negative language in the post, but you took it negatively. Speaks volumes.
---
Not even true, most of the zones in BfA are roughly as dark as Vanilla nights. There's a couple exceptions; Theramore on BfA is quite a bit brighter and I think it might have something to do with the phasing from the mana bomb scenario.

10 pieces in total, of which 2 on average drop
---
Old graphics are much less cartoonish than past WoD version of the game.
---
It’s your lego, isn’t it?
---
please no new animations or models they look far too different to be in classic. even if its just a toggle.
---
I would also add, that playing as shadow in raids is quite expensive from what I remember.
---
As every hybrid, people will expect you to go "extra mile". Mana is big issue for shadow and you need consumables/mana pots to keep you going and even then you're still far below most dps class and being there for that sweet shadow dmg debuff. Definitely something for more dedicated players. Of course dungeons and pvp is a different story.
---
I believe it was added in wrath, though on most private servers you can fish anywhere as none of them seem to implement the "There are no fish here" error message.
---
Better look than corpse runs. Fact. 
---
It’s not about control; it’s about not wasting time and repair costs over silly BS wipes.
---
no new model or animation toggle. if you want the new models and animations you can play them in bfa. they are too different from the original game!
---
That's my thoughts, I don't have time or the want to no life anymore and my immunity to wife aggro doesn't exist anymore.  I'll just play shadow and find a casual zg/aq20 group.
---
Love the Screenshots, can't wait to play my paladin!

A lot of the Albuquerque GM's (back when that office was there) played Frostwolf Horde.

---
cardiologist. now.

---
Yeah, I'm in the same boat. My son is only 2, though, so I can't even use WoW as a bonding event. I have to squeeze it in after he goes to bed and once I can stealth away from the wife when she goes to sleep, too.
---
You can reduce the price in 2 ways.  
---
   Reputation with your faction, the higher it is, the lower the cost, so you want to do quests that raise it, it is important you do them at the right levels where they still give experience otherwise you won't gain the exp, it's how it works in vanilla.   
---
  On top of that, the easier and most sought after discount was from pvp, if you get I believe it was rank 3, you can lower it even more.  
---
   **The problem is that there won't be a rank system in phase 1, so the pvp discount is unobtainable.**
---
Yeah, for Vael I'd take Alcor's or Eskhandar as a tank.
---
Please thank my source :)
---
After playing on pservers for so long I've sorta gotten a love/hate relationship with the combat log. There's parts of me that wish it didn't exist at times, because I feel it forces me to play cheesy to be competitive. There's just so many addons that *totally* change the game away from the way the devs intended, all because of that combat log.
---
Think about how it was before all those addons existed. Ever try raiding without a threat meter? Or raiding without some sort of notification that a big boss event was about to fire? This is how the game was designed -- those encounters weren't balanced with players having all that info in mind.
---
It was only in later content that things got *so* hard deliberately, because it was done that hard to make encounters a challenge again. In a way, combat log addons sort of spoiled the game. 
---
If there was a server that had the log disabled (or better, make it only available out of game, like a txt file created at exit) I'd play there in a heartbeat.
---
...that would suck
---
117 hours of content before i even get to end game content now that’s what I’m talking about
---
I played a Priest and a Rogue originally. The priest is a bit slow to level solo, but is a TON of fun in PvP and dungeons/raids because of how hectic classic is.
---
Uh, it pretty much is honorcraft if you listen to the orc lore.
---
I'm the opposite. I was always mr.nice guy helping everyone.
---
This time around my entire wow classic experience at least until phase 2 will be to make everyone elses (specifically enemy faction) Classic experience AS MISERABLE AS POSSIBLE.
---
My goal will be to make horde players quit. Just straight up "fuck this shit I'm done."
---

More like a change to combat talents... 
---
Move some of the +1% talents to the left and put in a talent that says:
---
"You are able to wield 2H Swords. You also gain "Decapitate". Decapitate deals +XX% Date if used for stealth but costs 20 more energy."
---
The Decapitate skip itself reads: 
---
"Misty have 2H Sword equipped.  Attempt to cut off the targets head in one fell swoop. If you're able to deal over 50% of your targets health in damage you succeed and that target takes a 12 second bleed for 80% of their max hp, otherwise the attack fails."
---
The idea is that you can kill NPCs with low health like Mages pretty easily if all you do is stack damage, taking attack power and crit over agility, but if you fail it uses 60 energy for nothing. For raiding you'd just use Garrote.
---
So for a dwarf example, i would need revered with ironforge?
---
First of all, ungoro mafia makes people running it rich and it will not happen in Classic. Secundo, buying gold is ridiculously easy with super low risk of getting banned
---
I agree with you. HD models with old world gear and old world environment just looks wonky.
---
Warriors can break gouge if they save that one ability, iirc
---
Brb making a 25 minute video on something we already knew
---
I don't remember it being as hard as everyone says it was to keep up on mana in zg/aq20 as shadow.  Maybe it was because I was over geared.
---
Vanilla 1.12 warriors do not need any more buffs lmfao.
---
Eh, probably not - I just recall reading combat logs omw way back to my corpse. This happened a lot. So I don’t remember the proper rotations - hence “sorta like that” :-)
---
P.S. I wouldn’t mind learning the proper rotation if you know it :-)
---
Holy fuck.
---
This made me so sad hahaha.
---
I‘m a big fan of satire but I never wanne read something like this ever again!
---
I‘ld rather do Politics.
---
Preferably, start a new expansion branch.
---
Port the graphics etc from the current expansions, this is just eye-candy and doesn't affect the game itself.  
---
Build on the mechanics of vanilla and stay true to it in the new expansion, for instance no flying, no sharding, no dungeon finder, etc. These all culminated in a faster-paced game but they also ultimately broke the social aspect of Vanilla.
---
Not sure if this is doable from a business perspective, this is all just wild musings.
---
It's really more pervasive than that. Plus, it's easier to get recruited into a guild if he's holy and they take him and his son as a package. Not to mention lack of shadow gear in PvE until the tiers he mentioned.
---
From my own experience it's also the point where you will be able to buy your mount if you don't do any grinding for it and just quest.
---

The demo client being like 90% smaller than the retail client should've given that away.

I know the music exists still, but vanilla couple with the music had a certain mysticism that really sells the game for me.  Especially Dun Morogh, Tanaris, BFD, Sunken Temple...

I just imagined myself rolling a rogue and getting mercilessly kited like I used to do to those poor bastards and I think it would make me rage 😂. I always loved the concept of warlocks and since I always roll undead it seems more befitting of the race. I mean honestly that's how the classic cinematic had it and I think blizzard nailed it.

I asked for evidence because your previous reply was essentially "you're wrong, so your argument is ridiculous". I'm not expecting you to provide scientific, peer-based research on the topic, but a reasonably thought out response was what I was asking for. Given that we can't provide a scientific basis for our finding, yes, we must rely on anecdotal evidence at this time. I'd like you to remember that my original post showed that I want Classic to be successful, so on that I'd say we agree. 
---
To start, you are quoting a 3 year old article in an attempt to show that a lot of people are currently playing WoW on private servers. Since accounts are free to make and pservers are infamously known to have many gold farmers and spam accounts, you cannot use total accounts made as an accurate way to show how many people A. currently play the game, or B. would potentially play Classic, since people who made an account 6 years ago won't necessarily still be interested. So let's move on to the only helpful number - Average players online. Assuming that only a small fraction of the 80k normal players are bots/gold farmers/etc.  would still leave us with a paltry number who show interest in Classic through their current playing of Vanilla on private servers. Fortnite alone has 125 million players. 
---
People will not be able to play multiple games at once because that is not possible. Understanding instead what you likely mean - that players can switch between Fortnite and WoW, is possible, but I think people currently playing FTP games will be unwilling to try out Classic because of the $15 barrier to entry, assuming Blizz doesn't have a free month promotional which would be a smart idea. You can definitely compare Fortnite and WoW because they are both video games that draw from the same customer base. The $15 fee doesn't mean that Classic will fail, as you seem to imply that I said, which I didn't. Let's just blow up those numbers and say that a million people will play Classic - that is still very much a niche market game. As others have mentioned, the success of Classic only needs a few high-pop realms, but I never said it wouldn't succeed, only that I believe that people are overstating the number of potential players. You said yourself that Classic wouldn't touch the top of the charts due to the subscription fee and competition with FTP games, so I'm not entirely sure why you're arguing with points that you clearly agree on.
---
Gtfo of here with that shit
---
And that time is only for the top speedrunners🐵 they skip alot of stuff during leveling🐶
---
Not sure if you're familiar with the pserver scene but there's a weirdly high proportion of them there. I assume it's because it's a relatively fringe community that lends itself to basement dwellers. Lots of pepe avatars and racial slurs.
---
It's actually one of the main reasons I'm looking forward to real Classic - playing with more normal people.
---
Good point, so I guess there are definitely less druids then, awesome. I think I’m gonna stick with my original choice and roll Druid.
---
An easier time farming than holy pala / rshams sounds awesome too.
---
Yes. IIRC you’ll need to be exalted with another race to buy their mount (If you want a nightsaber as a dwarf you’re going to need to grind the Darnassus rep)
---
OMG. I feel like this was an exact situation I put a ticket in for! Deja vu! I was on the Malfurion server!
---
Actively removed game assets from classic wow to make it more like classic wow.
---
Absolutely mind blowing discovery
---
I'd love to get back my old draenei shaman just for the feels. But the character was on my dad's account so i'm guessing i won't be able to :(.
---
Can't be Ganymede, I don't see any U.N. and MCR ships fighting above it.
---
I can see that. But also in the early raids, Blizzard seemed to depend upon fall damage entirely too much. Why bother to come up with a new mechanic? Just punt random players to the ceiling and let 'em fall. And the combat log was quite useful for analysis. As for threat meters, the first ones really didn't work and simply guessed what the threat level was based upon the data in the combat log. Later Blizzard did add to the API giving actual threat levels which made for far more accurate meters.
---
Much of the water in Vanilla was transparent/translucent. There were some bodies of water and rivers in STV that were Opaque but a lot of it wasn't.

---
I believe it was recorded in patch 1.9
---
I would not show the cd keys anywhere
---
There was a toggle in the november’s demo
---
Yeah that's my point, if you just hit 60 you can't pull this off.
---
Druid:  Flight Form :^)
---
Literally the biggest reason I will always have a sour taste whenever I'm gonna play Classic.
---
Don't want to play on a PvP server because world PvP in WoW is an unbalanced mess where the majority of it consists of capped characters ganking low level chars because they themselves suck at actual PvP? You're a fucking pussy and you're missing out the majority of the game.
---
You don't mind having the **clientside** option of having a toggle for new and old character models? The character on your side should look the same on the other people's side. Ironically, most people only jerk off to the insane gear you could get later on. Nobody cares how your character's face looks like.
---
People from retail want to try out Classic when it comes out? They don't deserve playing it because [they didn't fight for it] and because they'd just destroy the game.
---
People want Vanilla and the dev team decides on using the latest Vanilla version in the form of 1.12.1? Okay.
---
Alterac Valley is the 1.12.1 version and not the version with day long battles? *insert shocked pikachu meme*
---
Like, what? This whole sub, while admittedly having some amazing people here, is filled with people who almost post more memes and "look at this vanilla landscape and give me karma" posts than the main WoW sub. There is a reason why one of the biggest prejudices is that most Classic fans want it solely for the Nostalgia and this sub consists of a majority of those responsible for this misconception.
---
I was one of those against Classic. I hated it when it was announced. I also hated the idea of any legacy servers. The reason was because most of the players of those legacy privater servers are so close minded and hostile against almost anyone who likes the current WoW version. Be it in 2012, when I joined my very first private server (german WotLK server) or recently (a certain TBC server) - there are way too many intolerant people of whose information is often based solely on rumors, wrong information or wrong conclusions.
---
Best example is the scaling implemented with 7.3.5 for the old world. People have been crying since mid-Cata that leveling got too easy and that you were regularly outleveling the zones while not finishing the storylines. Blizzard implements scaling from 20-60, 61-80, 81-90 and 91-100 in order for people to level through the zones without ending up with grey quests. That also fixes the problem of exp requirements for each level getting twisted each time a new expac launches. It allows you to choose to do your favourite zones in almost any order and it allows you to skip Wrath or TBC zones, as well as Cata or MoP zones. This makes the leveling experience relatively unique with each character as you can choose the zones almost freely that you want to level in.
---
Yet there are people that claim that change is absolutely idiotic. It is -  for those who want to rush to cap to do max level content. Meanwhile, my father who has been playing since 2005 adores the change because all he does is leveling new toons since he can't keep up with the faster gameplay (although it was slowed down with BFA). He just enjoys leveling in different zones each time for an hour or two after work.
---
Just let people have their fun as long as it doesn't affect the gameplay of Classic. Cosmetic options are fine in my book as long as they are client side and give no gameplay advantages whatsover.
---
Ya playing as a shaman, they were bis for me for quite awhile. Ran that till I had them and hold on to it till 40
---
To be fair, the troll female run animations are pretty wonky on the old models as well, which is a shame and makes it hard to play them on either version.
---
As a Wrath player when I first saw this I puckered a little and asked myself if this is what I really want to sink my time into.
---
Hell yes it is.
---
I think this applies to graphics in general. I would even say that I prefer not to have improved graphics such as cata-water, dynamic shadows etc. Regarding viewing distance I'm not so sure. However, I don't think the original world was meant to be played with the increased viewing distance we have today and I wouldn't mind if they kept the original distance. QoL improvements such as resolution and refresh rate support is necessary of course.
---
There was also glove enchant + some stuff you could get from sunday contest (boots and hat?), l personnally did not level fishing at that time but I have now a 4 years old fishing bot so it should be easier this time :D
---
I‘d recommend undead shadowpriest aswell as UD warlock when you two also wanna play pvp, UD shadowpriest gets devouring plague, which is an incredibly nice pvp spell (but very mana intense). If you are willing to focus on pvp i‘m sure you can go casually up to rank 11 approx, and if you roam around together, you will be beast!
---
I'm not sure, it truly deserves more attention!
---
Cartman?
---
Great stuff. 
---
You've apparently raged yourself into a coma and now the only thing you are capable of is copying what I say and tacking on a straw-man at the end.
---
Are you about done making a fool of yourself? At this point it's really just sad watching you dig a deeper and deeper hole. Have a nap, you'll feel so much better, and maybe you'll be able to approach this like a normal person.
---
You're a stork.
---
\#nochanges, but I would be least mad if they added this.
---
Hackers can't guess your password unless you're giving it away.
---
Use separate login credentials.  
---
Don't use botting software.
---
Dude I downvoted your post, that means you're wrong! Why are you replying still?
---
Of course, relative to the old WoW but you apparently don't understand the point I made. Relative to other more realistic looking MMORPGs of the mid-2000s WoW looks like a cartoon, especially if viewed in the context of that time.
---
normies is just the new casuals.. get with the time bro
---
Probably this.
---
Hey, this call will be in next week’s episode that will come out on Wednesday, so you can’t find it on the show just yet. But otherwise yes, the show is available on apple podcasts :)
---
If I were to appear to a player (which was very very rare) I would definitely wear my GM robe.  Many of the later realms that got released I never bothered equipping my GM characters.  Realms came out to quickly for me to spent time dressing all of them, but if I were gonna show myself I would.
---
So you really think that it's going to be that cut throat to get into a guild to run 20s?  I'm not interested in repeating my vanilla experience of 30 hour raid weeks.
---
&gt; Leveling from 101-109 in Legion felt like one long level, because the enemies leveled up with you, leveling up or getting better gear had almost zero impact on gameplay. 
---
I agree. Auto-scaling sounded like one of those changes that would be great ("level up in zones in the order you want!") but in practice it turned every zone into identical repetitive slogs. 
---
And because the auto-scaling was tuned to make leveling super easy, you couldn't find a challenge even by going to other zones.
---
How does having a toggle and letting everyone choose whatever the fuck they like, which will have zero impact on you, affect you exactly? 
---
Get the fuck out of here.
---
IDK if it did or I just got kicked. It might have been one of those "sign my guild charter" things too.
---
Catchy
---
Now you just need to make a youtube video about it!
---
Hehe I’ll be similar. I don’t believe in an Eye For an Eye; I believe in Two Eyes and a Finger For an Eye. If Horde messes with me, the next 2 hours of their life isn’t going to be so fun.
---
this is so legitimate its incredibly sad.
---
Nah I didn't know what a twink was back then. I think I took engi because they crafted guns or ammo maybe?
---
Soggyplace
---
Whate a wonderful zone name.
---
Then don't use the toggle? Then someone who does like them can actually turn them on, and neither of you will affect the other. Your idea of what the game should or shouldn't be need not impact other people's enjoyment at all.
---
Yeah, I got the idea, but it's not an excuse to go down further into comic-style if it was the idea of your message.
---
Shadowmeld was pretty great for leveling and world pvp too IMO.
---
Are people seriously doing vael these days with no fire resist?  Is this just private server shit where every guild outgears is or are they actually going against vael with no fr? My guild had us stack that like mad when we were doing progression.
---
Only if they somehow manage to make it work better than it ever did on retail. What are the odds?
---
When if your alliance guide coming out so you can take my money?
---
Which one of these is the barrens theme
---
That's fine. You can latch onto that if it makes you feel better. Nighty night.
---
This sounds awesome! Keep up the good work :)
---
yep... /u/Empty_Allocution - u might want to delete the post and at least censor the product keys...
---
I've appreciated those same qualities. Especially the insistence from the vast majority on no/minimal changes. Back when they announced the project in late 2017 I had serious worries that a majority of interested people would be adamant about seeing it altered. That never happened, even as the population grew.
---
I've said it before and I'll say it again: The WoW Classic situation is the first time I've perceived customers advocating for themselves en masse in decades. Really proud/thankful of/to most of the posters here.
---
I think a lot was learned about how to most effectively handle the issue over time.  We went through a lot of growing pains while I was there.  The game was still relatively new, and we were figuring out the best way to serve the customers.  As time went on needs changed.  
---
When I first got there, the queues were 4 days long, the emphasis was on getting to the customer at all at that point.  Months down the road we had the queue where the moment a ticket hit the queue, some GM took it immediately, on a few occasions I had players blown away with how fast we answered.  During that time we were focusing on longer conversations.  Policies evolved as we learned more.
---
I think what we see now is the result is following that for such a long time.  I can see why a harassment issue probably doesn't require a GM to speak with a player, considering many times players didn't say much to me on those particular issues.  99% of the time they just said ok, thanks and that was that.
---
I do hope that the issues that need human touch still get the attention they need, but every interaction definitely had different needs, even back then, and we were always trying to figure out what resolved the players issue quickest, so they could focus on enjoying the game.
---
we not sure yet, will decide on realm launch probably  
---
but more likely aly with horde alts
---
Thanks
---
Too bad. Won't happen.
---
Is there a mod for that? There ought to be.
---
I played a priest with 500+ping for YEARS. Shields help save ppl/mitigate dmg while you cast. I think you'll be just fine. If just always have something casting, and let it go if you need to. cancel it if they dont need heals.
---
I wonder if your previous 1-60 record will stand
---
I'm not saying it will or won't, or even should or shouldn't. I'm saying that if there is a toggle it affects literally no one but the person using it. How is that a bad thing?
---
I mean, there is Blackrock Mountain. Sandwiched between pure Ally territory, IIRC. Only counter-example I can think of, though.
---
The only things I remember fearing in PvP as a priest in vanilla were rogues and warriors.  3 minute mages and locks were annoying but survivable.  I'm going to stick with my choice, DR exists in 1.12, I'd rather have the 10% chance to stun melee, and a turbo wand on spell lockout.
---
Good idea to support gambling addiction.
---
You sure those files aren't related to the Demon in the Atiesh questline? [https://wow.gamepedia.com/Demonhunter](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Demonhunter)
---
Haha no!  But I do get asked that a lot.  It's sort of a double inside reference.
---
Not sure how deep into the thread you read, but you may have saw me mention I coach Ice Skaters now.  Miki Ando and Mao Asada were two of my favorite (Mao is actually my all time favorite) I liked the way the names sounded together so I put them together, Mikimao.
---
The other reason I liked it was because for whatever reason I tended to work myself into either guild leadership or officer positions in guilds, often times by accident, but it became a joke that I was the "Chairman" thereby making me "Chairman Mao" - a name I took to because of my willingness to kill any PvP target on sight! ;)
---
It's a bit of a Catch-22 as I see it. Don't respond and risk letting some quite accusatory and belittling comments guide the conversation or respond and risk coming across too defensive. I guess everyone else will be the judge of that. Although, as this post has got about as much attention as a moan in a brothel, no harm, no foul, I guess.
---
Anyway, genuine thanks for that last bit of advice. I wasn't aware I'd get any love outside a WoW subreddit.
---
Horde has a quest for a quite good rod. Alliance/all should be able to get above standard rod too if I recall correctly. The extravaganza would be the best thing. Usually that lure + normal rod should suffice.
---
In addition to the fact that this is totally inappropriate and needlessly confrontational toward someone who is being thankful, someone with a post history like yours should not be citing other peoples' post histories.
---
Go play on your old 2004 computer and monitor with dial up internet then otherwise you'll destroy the game's value. Oh, and don't forget to ask Blizzard to release the game physically and get rid of battle. Net integration then finally ask your mom to go buy it for you from the store with her credit card. 
---
Also if you're really hardcore you can enroll in your old middle School, move back to your mom's basement and hang out with the 12 year olds in your spare time to make it more legit.
---
Yep! Expect to be around 240 hours of leveling if you're leveling at a normal pace! And if you're like me and stayed at the 40-49 pvp bracket for ages back in vanilla, 480 hours to hit 60 :)
---
nah:D
---
If you're talking in terms of experience to level, remember that higher level enemies give more experience per kill.
---
[a pirate I was meant to be, trim the sails and roam the sea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9bXjttMxKY)
---
I think just your MT will suffice, helpful for OT for sons. Every other boss? No fkn way just dont be stupid.
---
Sounds like you would really enjoy a rogue, but may not like how others perceive you? IMHO roll a rogue because it sounds like that is what you want
---
OH SHIT
---
The comment I find the most confusing is when some know-it-all jealous person starts writing half an essay how vanilla is shit and it's all nostalgic, completely oblivious to the private servers success that directly contributed to official classic.
---
Haha omg I am kinda glad you asked that.  Insane fast!
---
When I started the thread this had totally slipped my mind, but when you go from GM run speed to player run speed... BRUTAL!  That is the only hard part about not being a GM when you are a normal player.  It took me 5-10 minutes for the normal game to process at normal speeds in my brain after being able to run around, flying through walls at 20x speeds.
---
Not it wont be.
---
Well it could be any gas giant around any star I suppose.
---
It's alright but it's more of an added bonus, while stoneform can completely cripple classes like rogue and it has some pve uses.   
---
  You're also a hunter so you don't really need much help leveling, you're already the best.
---
A hunter would be nice to fill up our ranks. I used to play on Defias Brotherhood (rp-pvp server) during vanilla retail. 4 years ago my friends and I started playing on a pserver. There we formed a guild 'The Hungering Cold' and raided untill AQ40. Now classic is coming, we are going to rebuild our old guild, called 'The Hungering Old'. We will be casual as before, but effective at clearing content. We have an awsome maintank and guild leader! Pm if you would like to know more. 
---
Ps: we will be Horde!
---
yeah, when I logged back in it didn’t have any servers i’d played on highlighted. luckily I remembered most of the servers I played on so i found my characters pretty easily.
---
Not a normal GM who may have grabbed your ticket, but definitely leads and probably (just speculating here) there was some direction on who to watch so they could learn themselves about how real players interacted with it.  New bosses are always a work in progress, and players have a way of being very creative in their strategies!
---
Jokes in you, he didnt.
---
not a chance. he has already said he has found more optimized routes.
---
bare minimum, he will beat his own time. but this is an old game with many people who have been playing it for 15 years -- chances are very good many people are going to beat his old time, and possibly his new time in classic as well.
---
lmao nice
---
We had almost the exact same experience. And I mean that. 
---
I decided to go Warlock. I have no doubt that playing a Mage again would be incredible - and if I were only allowed one character I might pick that - but I change is very important. So much of the Vanilla experience was struggle and confusion and overcoming those things to become competent and proud. Picking a Mage would totally preclude those elements.
---
Good initiative, keep it up!
---
We all expect you to be ranked high on this leaderboard :)
---
Why would the joke be on OP if it isn't assumed OP is taking the length of leveling negatively?
---
I'm still not convinced.
---
Hey Joana had a question for you, do you think it's feasible for an intermediate WoW player to rush to level 30 in 30 hours on launch day? Human Warlock
---
Did we just become best friends?
---
I was a big PvP server player myself, so I was always on the side of leave PvP on PvP servers alone.  In general this was the stance.
---
The way to turn PvP into harassment was in circumventing rules in some way to do.  For example if you had an opposite faction friend telling you where someone was so you could corpse camp them, that is crossing a line that isn't meant to naturally happen in WoW.  Once it started to break that barrier it was no longer normal PvP.
---
Class Rogue
---
Trained at: Level 60
---
Name: Blade Shrapnel
---
Energy: 60
---
Radius: 5 yards
---
Requires: Daggers (main hand)
---
Cool down: 5 minutes
---
Gain an ability at level 60 that when used with Backstab, Ambush or Shiv your Main Weapon “breaks” and part of the blade is deep inside the enemies flesh dealing 750% weapon damage (main hand only) over 15 seconds. The targets wound is exposed which causes your poisons to have 100% chance to apply and increases your poison damage by 30%.
---
Passive: Your main weapons damage is reduced by 50% for the duration of the effect and it suffers 25% Durability loss.
---
Hearthstone removal: they just keep adding more.
---
He touches her chicken breasts now!
---
Goodnight, my wrong EU friend.
---
That website looks like it's from 2004. Authentic vanilla vibes.
---
This is actually a very interesting game design topic, imo.
---
Is more player choice always a positive? It reminds me of all the discussion that went on with the recent release of Sekiro, and people advocating for an easy mode.
---
Often times players want things that compromise the intended experience that a game is trying to convey. Difficulty is quintessential to Sekiro, it's what makes the game what it is.
---
You could easily make a similar argument here, the whole point of wow classic is to go back in time in the most authentic way we can. You could argue that modern graphics are in opposition to the spirit of the game, and the design philosophy put forward by the classic devs from the outset, which was to be as faithful a recreation as possible.
---
Personally, I don't think any updated graphics options should be in classic wow, besides what is completely needed such as resolution support. That said, I won't be completely broken up if they decide to add it, we're pretty sure updated lighting and such is staying.
---
Just do what I did and literally grind from 38-40 with skinning and even then still not even buy half your lvl 40 skills! Mount &gt; all!
---
All versions if WoW work perfectly in Wine. On my Linux laptop with a GTX1060 I ran the retail version at 4K with everything maxed out and had a gazillion FPS.
---
This performance is largely due to DXVK though. You probably don't have Vulkan (Molten) support, which means it'll have to use the OpenGL backend, which is hella slow compared. 
---
Still, it'll run. You will be able to play.
---
Start planning your routes now, play for 30 hours straight - that means poop socking and piss bottles, get waaaaaaay ahead of the curve in the beginning, and roll Hunter instead of Warlock, and you might be able to pull it off.
---
Alpha and beta are whatever the actual devs they are. They haven't been standard meanings of these words for years in the industry. 
---
But usually an alpha means it is far from being done.
---
I've had the same thought. Is that a coming thing?
---
Wrath was the beginning of the end so if you started near the start of that expansion there's actually going to be quite a bit that you still recognize. Hybrid classes will suck at dps way more than you're used to, though.
---
Or, you know, like with 90% of sw projects, they can't finish it in time and gonna postpone the release.
---
I’m gonna take old Blanchy to that old town road, I’m gonna riiiiiide till I can’t no more.
---
Interesting theory, let's see how it pans out.
---
10 days played is a lot, and is more than 'normal pace'. Expect 7-8 days played normal pace, 6 days fast and sub 6 for speedrun, depending on class.
---
That's not how sw development works. Classic is a new sw product, not a re-release of an old one. So heavy bugtesting is needed.
---
^ so ranged attack power increases its damage
---
Are u saying that i can’t fight deathwing in classic wow? Unsubbed.
---
I hope they dont include these models as atleast I feel they are not in the spirit of WoW, they look like playdough.
---
I wouldn't mind if they just had it as a toggle though with primary support going to the old models obv
---
The Brill inn (Gallow's End Tavern) music is called Undead Dance, and it's still in the retail game files! You can hear it with the macro
---
&gt;/script﻿﻿ ﻿PlaySoundFile("Sound\\Music\\ZoneMusic\\TavernHord﻿e\\undead_dance.mp3"﻿
---
Gallow's End was probably my favorite place in the game. I loved the fact that the interior was still kept up, with a fire in the hearth and the jangly weird energetic music. It encapsulated the vanilla Forsaken for me: coming to terms with their new affliction, but still holding on to some humanity and warmth. The transition to "everything Forsaken is evil and cold" was a bad writing choice imo.
---
Nah.
---
Tone down the rudeness, bro. I'm arguing that the loss of feeling of danger &amp; progression was undervalued by blizz. And blizz doesn't close the door on player conveniences. When they try a holistic redesign of leveling, the bulk of scaling will become unnecessary, but it's going to stay in, and leveling will remain deprived of that source of danger &amp; progression.
---
New Tauren still look better than old tauren*
---
All of my memories of this kinda pvp fuckery in water are in STV so that makes a lot of sense. Either way it won't be a big deal, but if Classic graphics had 2 water features it would be really cool to see the opaque water show up in STV on high-graphics Classic.
---
This is amazing, good for you for doing this dude!
---
How dare he support the president!
---
No Collusion or Obstruction, btw. Move along, NPC.
---
I heard some people talk about 24h for lvl 30.
---
But the only way for you to know is to test it on a pserver.
---
This is not how it was originally i swear, the actual mount cost the higher price and the skill was fairly cheap and there was only one skill I think, but you had to buy both mounts seperately and the faster one cost 1000g 
---
Then they changed it so that the skill cost more and made the mounts cheaper - I remember that before that you only had one mount because if you wanted a second it was another 1000g.
---
Yeah going Alliance as well but I plan on also leveling a hordie to 60 as well so wanna keep that as fresh as I can for retail classic haha.
---
Although I did give into the urge a little and leveled a shammy to 20 on a pserver a few weeks ago.
---
None of this is even data mining, this is just examining file structures. Data mining is using statistical analysis techniques on large data sets to draw new conclusions.
---
Tibia was my game back in those days. Its somewhat similar to runescape. I still remember the first level 100 in that game: Bubble. She was widely talked about on all servers.
---
You chill out lol. I said I wasn't taking a shot at you, nor did I think you were bragging. I'm just excited/hopeful that the "I did X on private server Y, therefore you should do Z" talk will die out except for within hardcore guilds.
---
Also Ungoro crater. That musics rings of Ungoro very much for me personally.
---
obviously internet is your place for game info but i would totally give it a read as well. big nostalgia boost. thinking of trying to get one myself. the one i had back in the day i cut out all the models and art so i could tape them around my room. 😂
---
Any random item that's actually pretty good but inexplicably has +23 of your least used stat.
---
Hey Joana I bought your guide 15 years ago \\o/ 
---
With all the young wolves preparing to out-speed you, the pressure must be tremendous !
---
I'm rooting for you, may the winds be with you ;-)
---
PS I hope you'll stay horde and not reroll nelf for faster speed.
---
Question about /played time, are you doing anything to mitigate the effects of rested XP there?   
---
I might give shortest /played time for some class a shot, the patience that would be required to be rested the entire time would be a challenge in and of itself.
---
&gt; Toggled client-side...maybe, I prefer not.
---
So why is this an issue? You literally wouldn't be impacted by it, would you? I personally don't care much either way, though one point I'd give new models is that I could stand to play a Druid for once (I love druids, and played them a bunch in vanilla, but damn it felt tough playing one for a significant amount of time on less-than-legal-servers). 
---
Whether HD models with old gear looks wonky or not, I think, is also besides the point if it's just a toggle. It's entirely up to the individual player.
---
yeh i remember that, but im wondering if dwarfs want a ram mount cheaper, what do you need?
---
Seems you put some thought into this. I like the forum post idea for timestamps.
---
On the pservers I played on that I started FRESH, the 1st to 60 I remember on 3 servers was a Mage, a Hunter and a Feral.
---
I doubt many servers will see another class hit 60 before those unless some really dedicated people push seriously hard with other classes. Warlock might happen as they are extremely easy to level but their dps hurts their pace compared to the other 3 mentioned.
---
I'm interested to see the stats for Classic though, as the pserver scene is heavily bloated with experienced players. I look forward to a good mix of new and old for Classic.
---
Jesus Christ the amount of vitriol in some of these comments. Who are you people? Dude posted something relevant.
---
This sub is hilarious sometimes, did you expect something different?
---
the /played only part is pretty meaningless without recording significant chunks of it
---
could just do it with rested only, massive twink gear, mob tagging, personal healer etc
---
Great idea!
---
I’d love this, maybe not a hard taunt that’s as good as warriors but something that generates a fair bit of threat, something that’s possible for paladins to tank atleast some low level raids but still not as good as warrior without min maxing.
---
If Blizz Classic Dev Team takes the old school runescape route of adding small dribbles of items and content over a long time I think it would be cool to see items that have a chance on hit to generate threat or maybe a very rare drop rate book that learns a spell to generate threat for paladins would be very cool
---
You can't toggle the new models on live anymore, that option was taken out.
---
Warlock will probably be faster than feral for Classic since in Classic faceshredding doesn't work (the druid version of rogues frontstabbing). Not having that slows down leveling quite a bit.
---
Yes.
---
Shadowsong stand up!

So, are there any priest builds that stack ranged AP?

My guild was so mad when I dropped big dick dkp for my zin'rokh.

The tavern music only includes the original tavern music from Classic and contains none of the new music from TBC and onward.

Heya just you need to type it like this for it to work on retail just gotta add an additional \ everywhere hehe.

In conclusion, you find hunters and rogues fun. Why would you let anything else matter?
---
Bro, you the man!!!
---
You will need to practice a lot on a pserver but level 30 in 20 hours is possible as a warlock - 25 if you're a little more relaxed.
---
Well thanks!
---
The style of the web page, wellcome back to 2004´s internet.
---
Warlock was fun too I should've mentionned it :S

You're right, you're right Fun&lt;All

thanks :D

Or some creepy OP hybrid running riot in the greenhouse, sneaking it's way into a ship.
---
That is why I say to submit these within the first 3 weeks of Classic launch.  Ideally I would like these to be under 2 weeks, but 3 weeks is ok I suppose.
---
A lot people might see that shamans or paladins will be double in population to their respective druids but also forget to factor in class distribution in raids. Guilds will generally never really want or need more than 2 Resto druids, while you want 5-6 shamans and sometimes more. So from a math perspective you have a much higher chance of finding a competitive raiding guild as a shaman since you need 3 times as many shamans for every druid that applies.

Not really. The gameplay is what matters.

We don't even know there will be a beta open to the public. They could do a beta with only Blizzard staff.

I just hope they get rid of it, just because I don't want to download all the files, which won't be in the game anyway.
---
That's like my only thing, I just don't want to download a big ass game, because of too many useless files.
---
Reminds me of other games, where you had to download the HD textures extra. So annoying.
---
This is nonsense.
---
Play dorf hunter, they shit on rogues. Horde might have more pvpers but all the high end pvpers will be playing on alliance for shorter queue times. Be prepared to get stomped in premades :)
---
Guild banks were introduced with patch 2.3.0 (Nov 13, 2007). Almost a year after Burning Crusade started (Dec 5, 2006).
---
Warlock is better than Hunter for 1-10. Hunter beats out warlock thereafter, but if we're talking rushing at launch I'd bet that warlock would beat a hunter to 30 considering it can get ahead of the curve quicker than the hunter.
---
Nice, I look forward to seeing the results. Thanks for setting it up, it's good to have fun community stuff like this.
---
I pray every night with all my heart, but the nightmare comes back regardless.
---
A couple of people have asked me, and yes, the assets for guild banks are present in the Beta as of now. Again, this doesn't mean we'll have guild banks: https://imgur.com/wIptSKe

I created a shopping list spreadsheet for consumables way back in 2006 which you might find useful. I haven’t updated it since then, so the Thottbot links won’t work.

---
Honestly I don't think age has much to do it with it, if anything I bet r/wow skews pretty old. Just that the general, casual player base of retail WoW seems to be more interested in mounts, collectibles, and art than actually playing an RPG.
---
What a stupid question. It's almost as if they're using other modern assets for parts of the game.... Hmm....
---
This fuckin sub sometimes I swear to God why did you even start this thread it's valueless
---
I actually thought about going alliance earlier today but I just can't. Alliance races are so dull :'( The only + is Ironforge's swagginess + a tram.   
---
Oh man now I remember the Dwarf laugh and want to go alliance wtf do I do.
---
Because it could be mandatory for pvp. The new models would pop off the world compared to the old models making noticing other players so much easier. On top of that the new models did change the actual model rig of the character that could have other benefits. It is not as simple as this one is clearer textured and the other is not.
---
Woah
---
Can you think of another big art asset that they're using the modern equivalent of?
---
Perhaps modern art assets or the current game engine?
---
Use your brain.
---
Anecdotal evidence of "my friends don't know about Classic" and using it as some kind of source that Classic isn't as widely known as we think is in fact a ridiculous argument.
---
So instead of using what numbers we have we're going to assume the number has dropped in the last 3 years after 15 years of private servers existing. On what basis? Your gut feeling?
---
So fucking pedantic, jesus christ. You know exactly what I mean, stop trying to belittle me. Fortnite is mostly played by children that A. Has no money, and B. Has never touched WoW and definitely not Vanilla, ever. They definitely do not share the same customer base.
---
A million players on Classic is definitely not a niche game, it is very much a resounding success. Just because F2P games that are insanely easy to access get 100 million players doesn't mean a million players is all of a sudden a bad number or make that game a niche market. You seem to think topping the charts is the only metric on which a game can be judged whether or not it is a niche game, which is fucking crazy. No subscription based game or game that you have to physically buy will EVER top the charts BECAUSE you need to spend money on them, and by your logic they are ALL niche markets.
---
NEED !
---
Level 26? He's brand new!  Just drove him off the lot.
---
I’ve never yanked but I main fury warrior, does battle shout actually generate AoE threat
---
Not for newer models there wasn't.
---
Hopefully they can have their own toxichats within their try-hard guilds.  I've played on multiple PServers but cannot wait for a more pure casual vanilla experience ^^commencedownvotes
---
I would definately play with the new graphics and animations given the choice.
---
But it ***needs*** to be a choice. If it was only the new models, I would bitch and moan like any other sane person.
---
I understand, I was just pointing out that the two main ones for two of the types (Fire/Shadow) were not there.
---
Extra threat doesn't sound bad at all. Might be good for preventing wipes in dungeons. Get the attackers off the healer. A bigger problem might be the long cast time, you usually don't have a lot of time when the healer is attacked, but still useable if you know when to use it.
---
i saw a post recently of the leaked settings menu with a "classic" button, could it be that we could switch back and forth?
---
There's already a spell like this: \[5\]\[World\]: Azuregos is up.
---
Speak for yourself, I love a good Hitler parody.
---
I've seen this meme several times but haven't managed to find the sound clip. I assume the pserver I've been playing on has newer sounds since I can't find any creepy nelfs around
---
And here I am just hoping by week 3 to hit 60 with my warrior.
---
UBRS buff+GFPPs do most of the work. Add a few fire resist pieces or the fire resist juju for good measures. You’re at 100-150 FR and you’ll tank 4-6k fire damage because of the pots.
---
More the T6 hunter? The One with the eyes
---
Yes it does! As you level up towards 60 you probably will have to tank. Being Fury spec or Arms spec doesn't matter. In a raid situation usually there are people designated to Battle Shout if they have the improved shout talent, otherwise the attack power increase is overwritten by other effects that are better. 
---
But back to dungeons, if you tank yeah Battle Shout does generate AoE Threat, it is a god given gift.
---
Also referenced as “el hatched wound.”
---
The ubrs buff was a pain in the ass though. That was like suuuuuuper min max time when we broke that out. We usually just rolled with FR gear due to the time requirement of MCing and buffing a whole raid.
---
I have played a few private servers and ha e experienced what you're describing. It is really unfortunate and sad to see people behave so disgusting.
---
I can not wait for Classic to filter those people out.
---
I completely agree with you and I have been downvoted to hell for saying that on this sub but I still stand by it.
---
I grind the AH I’ve made 20g from scratch by lvl 20... I’m going to pay for a second account just to be able to do my thing while leveling.
---
Is this eu/na only? How many regions do u plan on doing this for?
---
As a warrior with out AV at launch mah icebarberd spear :(
---
It's been ages, but I *think* the only rep-based reduction in prices occurs at honored, and it's 10%.
---
Also, cloth turn-ins were a feature that got added during Vanilla, so they might not be in from the start.
---
Sounds good :) I'll drop you a PM

I asked the same question. I need a gaming laptop Cos I work and also Cos I need to remain sociable with the wife and not go full raider on her and the kids.

Have a look at the great feedback I got from the tech savvy players, it was a great help for me and I know what I am going to buy soon. 👍

Hey Joana. I haven't been following it closely but did you ever get a response from Blizzard about the videos of your legitimate vanilla footage being taken down as suspected private server footage?
---
Thanks for all contributions you've made!

KKona Clap
---
Another point is that the way our character looks is not only important to our own perception, but how we know others perceive it. 
---
I'm a roleplayer, and I'm going to be playing a Night Elf hunter. I want to know that the rest of the world is seeing the character *I Designed* (to an extent) and not a goofier (in my opinion) model with possibly wildly different facial features/hairstyles. 
---
Then, of course, there's the pure preservation reason and that I would argue it is against the spirit of classic, however slightly. 
---
Aaand finally PVP, as u/Deity_Majora said below.
---
Idk paladin was slow as hell at 60 imo but it was my first 60 and I was bad then.
---
As someone who is primarily looking forward to leveling, this excites me more than any of the cool old raid photos or T2 sets or things like that.
---
Probably not as good as other healer combos but druids have access to utility and kiting options other healers don't. (Curse of tongues is especially annoying on paladin and shaman. Also annoying on priest but not as bad). But hunter is the ideal druid partner over warrior.
---
The thing with druid is you're probably better of budding up with a hunter as druid and hunter are best friends. Similar move speed bonuses and kiting strategies. It's annoying to deal with Fap warriors or BoF warriors but you have options and your own faps. Against priest hunter has viper string even though you are weak to dispel, you can out attrition priest. Paladin can't dispel your own own FAPS so you can dual kite, shaman can't defensively dispel. You always have a pet for push back and damage during CC, it's just a great widdle down team. The roots and stun that druid bring help hunter avoid dead zone pressure and you bring feral charge interupt (shaman being the only other healer that can. I'm not 100% sure but I've heard daze goes through Fap which hunter has access to and frost trap is undispelable to help with kiting for both hunter and druid.
---
You get some advantages as a duo with a warrior but just try to buddy up with either a hunter or get more people with the warrior to cover weaknesses. You still have regrowth and down ranked heals for faster cast times.
---
inc athene bans!
---
Nearly no difference. I've done both on pservers. The main reason why they level fast is because of no downtime and being able to string kills back to back just like warlocks. Even without front shreds, a feral does nearly twice the damage of a warlock (both min/maxed and warlock even having access to shadow wrath gear).
---
You're a true hero! Thank you very much 🤗
---
you mean 60? heh
---
listing debuffs that if punched off the debuff priority list by mortal strike, causes a net dps loss to the raid, is not necesarily me recommending that hunters should always use serpent sting.  
---
That's an entirely different discussion.
---
&gt;only way to play is ban threatening geforce now
---
wait, you can play WOW on GeForce now?
---
Very true.
---
I’m testing out leveling arms atm and I just got anger management I’m hoping the extra rage makes lower level tanking less brutal
---
Battle shout is great threat generator period. Not only for aoe. So keep it in your toolbox for whenever you need to build threat quickly.
---
Yeah, 10 days is for when you go out of your way to not level and you spend a lot of time fucking around doing nothing productive.
---
^ not false
---
Yep. I forget what fight, but I remember at least one raid encounter which had adds and the tank's strategy during that phase was to dump his rage by casting battle shout repeatedly to keep drawing the adds to him.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bL9l9f1Fik](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bL9l9f1Fik)
---
So we likely won’t see new models but jus new textures and that’s the best option we can have.
---
Noooooo they blew it up THEY BLEW IT UP GODDAMN YOU ALL TO HELL
---
\&gt;modern art assets
---
Literally where?
---
\&gt;current game engine
---
Nothing to do with art.
---
And do you really survive enough time to use 10 AE's vs. six mobs at level 14? I get that you can slow them with frost nova but that would be too mana draining to use within the span of 10 AE's. 
---
Either case, I would say that it's not effective to AoE farm at level 14 instead of questing but I'll be happily proven wrong. I will start at lvl 20 nonetheless on my mage
---
Yep. Or doesn't know how to read english ;-)
---
Hey keep me updated with that I'm curious to know if it's worth going Arms before 40!
---
Please, someone shoot him. Put him out of his inevitable misery.
---
Amen.
---
As an extra druid talent, deep in the resto tree, I think it'd be reasonable. 
---
It was always a little weird how resto druids couldn't rez a group out of combat while all the other healers (including hybrids) could.
---
Honestly as a 30 min cooldown many hybrid restos might not even pick it up. If you require 2/2 improved tranquility and have it branch off further down the tree then it'd make sense just to make it a baseline rez at that point, given that you're a full resto druid by that point.
---
Otherwise, yeah if it's just given to all druids then a 1-2hr cooldown is pretty reasonable.
---
Osconty, anyone?
---
I remember in MC there were certain fights where everybody put on their resist gear.
---
Without it, healers couldnt keep up with the DPS.
---
It only really matters for 60 raiding and PVP. Shadow resist gear in PVP is pretty decent as well.
---
Arcane resist to not get timelapsed by Chromaggus 200IQstrats.exe
---
I started playing 3rd qtr 2006 or thereabouts on a lock. 
---
Never hit 60 before TBC, and I don't recall time played when I did hit 60. I do recall hitting 70 on that toon tho, and it was 30 days played.
---
I was glad to hit max level, but not because I was bored. In fact, there was one or two TBC zones I still hadn't visited by 70 (maybe even 3?) but I immediately maxed out all his trade skills, then moved to an alt.
---
frekin no changes god damnit.
---
I couldn't imagine playing WoW for the first time in a language I didn't understand back when there was no native quest tracking. That would be one hell of a learning experience!
---
It’s a Renaissance
---
I would rather see Blizzard keeping the integrity of the original experience. After all, that is what Classic is meant to do. It's just something I prefer.
---
To be honest, I think I'm a little scared by the thought of them adding the option. What keeps them from mixing in other "modern" features as well? I think it's ultimately conflicting with my own philosophy of what a classic experience is. It's here the opinions differ and I respect that.
---
When did they do this? You mean to tell me my dk will have the same animation for scourge strike as ALL other death knights regardless of race? This is kind of cool I guess, unless you hate the class animation of course. Actually my hunter in tbc was based purely on female night elf animations being way more enjoyable than other alliance hunters at the time. It's weird that they'd suddenly change it.
---
So far I’ve enjoyed the cheaper heroic strike. Doing WC tonight which is always a low rage dungeon if you bring cc. Define ugly hoping to see if it’s worth being able to charge go defensive and have 25 rage. I leveled last year fury till 40 the aoe slow is real nice but you lack rage in low level dungeons.
---
20th April - Hitler's 130th birthday, only pure Aryans get into
---
20th May - beta, random invites happen every week
---
20th June - stress test happens, then 2 weeks of open beta free preview
---
20th July - realm first level 60
---
Hmm thats a good question.  I suppose I can arrange this so i can show both regions.  Im wondering if Classic WoW will be a global launch for all regions, or separate region time launches.
---
With but I’ve found some low level markets I can profit from for a majority of launch and be 100% profit.
---
I bought a really nice budget 1060ti I7 MSI laptop. It runs the current game on ultra pretty well. So I'm sure classic will no problem. Right at $1000
---
Not yet, I am still working on it.  Actually just today I sent a counter DMCA to twitch for the first time, so we will see what happens!
---
It does generate threat but your whole party has to be in range, and on the aggro table, and it does nothing for dmg/mitigation. It is nice but not something to use all the time, just another tool use when it fits.
---
The mechanics, classes, abilities, areas, etc. will all be the same. If you want to play with old graphics just play with old graphics. I'm looking forward to actually being able to play wow on max settings and have it actually look good, but hey, go right ahead with that low rez toggle. This isn't like I hit a button and suddenly rogues in your client don't require an entire profession for poisons. It doesn't affect your game at all if someone decides hey I want to play at 1080p and not 800x600
---
I want ironwork eventually with trinket and a shaman.
---
I don't think my wife would be happy for me to no-life for several months. I will probably have to be a casual scrub and try and form/join some sort of regular Saturday/Sunday raid alliance. 
---
An alternative would be to use up work holidays secretly and get my fix that way?
---
Druid is the best since they have Thorns. A much higher level mob just hits them once and the Druid kills all the mobs after lowbie agros the area
---
I've been a developer/architect for decades.  beta has alway been 'feature complete, needs ua testing' to me or anyone in my circle.  Alpha is sort of 'this isn't on fire, try it'
---
Actually wondered too. So i tried to search up what they did in BFA. Found out they actually did it same time on each region.
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/21849061/battle-for-azeroth-one-launch-to-rule-them-all
---
As u can see they all launched at the same time, however this was the first time wow ever did it (before it was seperate times)
---
So hopefully it's same time for all regions with classic too
---
In the distance
---
*take me hooomee, country roooaaads...*
---
Word.  
---
I enjoy PvPing while leveling to 60 and not having rage when switching stance is torture. Like you said piercing howl is great but wouldn't Arms work better?
---
lol just because you can’t make gold efficiently doesn’t make it nonsense. If you hit 60 with like 5-6 friends first and claim the devilsaur market you can make like 20k gold in 2 weeks. I’ve been doing this a long time my man. You believe what you want I was just trying to help.
---
I am reviewing the routes and practicing my skills.  I hope that the release date does not conflict with vacation blackout dates.
---
I remember getting five of those at once when I started multi boxing at the start of TBC. It was like all my Christmasses 😀
---
Well on pserver abusing /sit from fury is why people enjoy it more but I hated doing that.
---
Did you play the beta? They're using modern textures
---
Yeah, you're right about the game engine, it's a non art example of where they're using modern things, which further shows how obvious the answer to your stupid question was!
---
Pussies triggered
---
You can remove rogue poison, serpent sting, rogue blind, and devouring plague from spriests which is huge. Viper sting those spriests and laugh at them while they are useless when oom
---
Classic summer refers to us playing it longer than a couple weeks in summer.
---
When someone says have a good day they dont mean have a good 2 hours of your day, they mean they hope they have a good rest of your day. Well I guess unless they're just assholes. 
---
People getting this "summer is still in September so technically we could see it the last day of summer" are delusional. We will be playing classic for a majority of the summer more than likely.
---
175 days
---
Makes it feel like a lot less of a "race to the finish"
---
Wow what a blast from the past! Joanna I used your guide back in BC to level as fast as possible and it worked amazingly well. Every route was well planned and circuitous. Saved me a ton of time. Nice to see you here!!!
---
I think my total is in the 60-70 day range over my characters.

Arcane Ward

Nef phase 1. Tanks just group up and spam battle shout and it works pretty much perfectly. Mobs run right to them and stay glued to them the whole time.
---
Yea Paladin is slow, but not as slow as Priest.
---
About 150 (iirc) days played from launch day until May 2007.
---
I dont get the concept of poop socks and piss bottles. Generally bathrooms are like 5-10 seconds away from the resident all the time. Why not just go there :D?
---
Yea i think the idea was HS-&gt;Exe-&gt;White-&gt;Exe, but I am not sure if that was enough rage.
---
My buddy in TBC still had the Fenrus Hide cloak from SFK while leveling in Zangarmarsh. I loved how connected you could get to items.
---
r/wholesomebrits
---
Its from Nixxiom, he has several videos on the ishnu’alah guy
---
No one asked him to reveal his sources. In fact it doesn’t even matter if he’s lying since when it is announced he can just say he knew all along. I’m criticizing him for dangling some information in front of us as clear bait to get us to click on his next videos. He’s never going to tel us the time frame so it’s just a bait tactic
---
Please use the Monday LFG thread.
---
Get automatic slot in whichever dungeon, pre-raid bg and raid you want. It's sweet honestly, but farming sucks.
---
Ah okay, I can understand that.
---
Doesn’t matter if you’re lying or not if you never tell us. Once the info is out you can just claim that you knew it all along . Pointless
---
If there is a toggle for new player models, it would apply to NPCs also.
---
I don't think you understand *why* they're using the current engine, but rest assured it's not new just for the sake of being new. I watched plenty of gameplay of the demo and did not see any updated textures. They looked smoother in part because of the lighting and in part because of the new engine. Going out of their way to implement new textures would be a huge waste of development time to add something that nobody wants.
---
Every. Second. Counts.
---
Does battle shout generate threat if your party already has the buff and you're just refreshing it?
---
That's what everyone is claiming but I see nothing to back the claim up. Over on the barrens.chat website, theres a speedlvling forum topic that has people submitting 1-10 times. I see hunters getting even better times than warlock there so... what do you have to back up the opposite?
---
Y'all stink and I hope you stub your toes. All of them.
---
What's the reason for night elf being faster? Extra bow skill + 5% damage to beasts seems pretty hard to beat, unless alliance questing is simply faster than it is for horde.
---
Can someone datamine if the original weather effects are there, if its possible?
---
true, still things it needs a sticky.
---
Mages warlocks priests all have cloth armor and get hit like trucks. Might be personal opinion but if they all have cloth armor it's moot to even bring it up. Inner fire helps sure but it's not amazing
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but **Honored** rep is the 10% discount, not Revered. Also, Rank 3 PVP as others have mentioned.
---
I can’t remember but probably somewhere around 150 days.
---
This is what happen with osrs and rs3
---
Min max bro
---
 I always wanted some new sexy Orc Ladys the only issue was that ugly face, an toggle Option could be a solution
---
sounds like a male orc rogue.
---
I can only imagine what you were doing wrong if you think druids kill things 1.5 faster than warlocks. Actually I'm kinda curious. Only using searing pain and drain soul? Spamming soulfire?
---
Shadow priest and warlock combo is a cool theme but the benefit of shadow debuff from priest mostly applies to elites or killing a healer in pvp because mobs die too fast for the stacks to make a difference
---
Same for me.
---
Alliance has faster leveling speed overall (in a race) due to some level brackets being better for a certain faction. IIRC alliance pulls off early, horde is better in the 20-30s while alliance is better in the later levels. Probably slightly wrong, but it’s something along those lines.
---
For the same reason you'd expect HQ models to make it in. We don't know how Blizzard thinks. They might've thought by adding more tracks it would improve the quality of the game.
---
It's easy to make it seem like such an unreasonable thing in hindsight, but it was definitely a concern before.
---
Nothing specific, but it should be noted this build has A LOT of assets in it we know for certain will not be in Classic.
---
It's easy to make it seem like such an unreasonable thing in hindsight, but it was definitely a concern before. (Sorry for copypasta)
---
We did this for Nef back in og Vanilla. A warrior could aggro adds from both sides and keep threat against dps aoe.
---
Same..I'll take all the new graphics
---
My paladin had 100. Played from release till TBC
---
GTX 1050Ti or GTX 1060 will easily handle it and many other games. Plus the newer generation of Nvidia GPUs. GTX 1050 and some integrated Vega GPUs in more mobile laptops could also be an option if the CPU isn't bad and you are willing to lower some settings or resolution to 1080p if needed.
---
My question is this: did you have some kind of manager who looked around and talked to people who were 'kinda slow'?  
---
Like if there was this Super-Senior-GM solving 15 tickets/hour and someone did like 5/hour, did Blizzard ever take steps to rush their employees?

As a Hunter, I'd say a high skilled Hunter will be faster than a high skilled Warlock, as things like juggling and moving between auto-shots play a big part in getting a fast 1-10 time for Hunter. That being said, for average players, a Warlock is probably faster, because there's not much to making a warlock level fast than just being efficient with the route.
---
Prior to launch, you will have activated your live account... perhaps there's an option to transfer your key binds over? I imagine beta will also shed some light into this as well.
---
That’s why you get a laptop my man
---
I legit almost linked myself to /r/lostredditors for a moment there.
---
Glad to see fans of the series in all places :D!
---
I managed 21 in 14h30m without assistance (with mining and cooking) on a warrior of all things. The catch is, relatively empty server. You need serious contingency grinding plans at launch.
---
Thank you!
---
The toggle doesn't even work properly on retail.  
---
It DOES somewhat work in terms of the model, unless you're playing any of the elven races, since they got rid of the old elven models for some reason when they designed Legion.  
---
What absolutely does not work even on retail is the option to toggle old animations. Even when playing with the old models, they still use these very wonky animations.  
---
Seeing how we actually had the old animations on the demo, I suspect the reverse will be true for Classic. You might be able to toggle new models, but you won't be able to get the new animations because it requires a different skeleton.  
---
I personally don't mind it because I much prefer the old animations, but I can already see the complaints of people who want the new ones to make it in.
---
AFAIK Joana has previously said he will be doing Horde at launch, and will do an Alliance speedrun sometime afterwards.
---
My main had close to 400 days. With alts, I was probably at 500 days. But I was also single then :)
---
If the new models make it into the live game I am gonna be pissed
---
FFXIV professions are essentially classes and a massive money and time sink that require crystals to progress in, making maxing all the professions only really something attainable by players dedicated to it and have played a very long time. It wouldn't work in WoW. every player ever would just have all the professions maxed, because they're so easy to level. (though not like professions actually matter in retail anymore anyway)
---
Silence is kinda magic damage reduction
---
Ive been trying to find some with 120 hz refresh  but also having trouble finding an affordable one,    Ive been checking  [reddit.com/laptopdeals](https://reddit.com/laptopdeals) often
---
Same Problem have to choose a new gender for Orc maybe
---
it also depends on pop , server stability , and other stuff
---
we should be able to practice with the actual beta client some time
---
found the warlock
---
Lol so is a renew or pw shield if you wanna stretch the definition and criteria
---
Somewhere around 200 days by the time TBC was released, only one main no alts at all.
---
Yes I am preparing and practicing to play a Troll Hunter for Classic launch.  Then Alliance runs after that.
---
Of Warcraft.
---
Europe had their GMs in Paris. I actually applied for a position and was offered it, however I ended up turning it down since I didnt want to move to France. I guess they had English, French and German speaking GMs under one roof.
---
Not to mention they are very unnatural looking. You can tell they tried to avoid "dead frames" by weaving in minute movements in every frames which results in these wobbly almost rubber-like animations, while the classic ones do actually look pretty convincing and natural.
---
Note however, that in classic you will have pretty much the same animation for every melee attack as well. Casters also only have the "buffing" animations (For Female Human i.e. thats the one where they raise the arm), and the "damaging" animation where they extend their right arm forward, and that's it.  
---
It's even worse for melee to be honest.
---
What honestly might be interesting if retail goes back to the way things were with all its achievements and features. The biggest problem in wow pre-wrath was finding stuff to do outside of PVP and Raiding. What did you do when you're locked out for raids for the week and sick of PVP? You did some fun shit like raiding enemy towns but that was it. The socializing and trade chat were fun distractions.
---
Casual PVP in BFA is actually varied enough now. They added in a Epic BG que, AB and WSG got graphically updated, they re-added Wintergrasp. Doing collect-a-thons during content draughts is actually fun. All the side content in WoW has been fucking great. But the main stuff like raiding is so goddamn boring, the dungeons are piss-easy and the questing is just button-mashing with heirloom gear. I have to play wow with a podcast or youtube video in the background outside of PVP to not get bored to tiers by it.
---
Then again people would rather do collect-a-thons then city-raiding or pointless world pvp. It has to be for something now. It can't be done just for fun like it used to be.
---
yeah but why a sock? i mean if you plan ahead you could definitely find something better than a sock to poop in. like an empty pickle  jar.
---
are smite priests viable leveling in a duo?
---
i assume not but would be nice to be able to heal the dungeons for gear as you gp without respec's
---
Nice! That is what I wanted to hear and hopefully it will be like that for Classic also!
---
That's the one I was thinking of!
---
Class: Rogue
---
Replacing Vigor as the final talent in the Assassination tree.
---
Name: Coup de grace
---
Cost: 40 energy
---
Cooldown: 30 seconds
---
Effect: The rogue strikes the target with a poisoned blade, inflicting X damage and increases the effectiveness of all the rogues poison against the target by Y%. The effectiveness increases the lower the victim's health is, up to a maximum of Z% at 20% health. 
---
Generates 1 combo point.
---
You must not remember trade chats in their prime. They will always be amusing shitshows to me. Basically Youtube comments in wowchat. It was great.
---
Played end of WotLK-Through end of MoP. I might’ve played a little of WoD, I bought it even, but my old computer couldn’t handle the new zones so that’s when I kinda quit.
---
how long does it take to get a full level of rested xp? like a week?
---
Yes
---
If you pay him on Patreon he gives beta access I think. Other than that joining his discord is also a good source of information
---
I can totally be someone's friend. Whoever the vanilla WoW lead producer is: we are having a BBQ tomorrow here in Somerset. Come on by. Free tequila-beer with lime and other alcohol. Nice beef.
---
You can just leave the key on the table...!
---
I might add that dungeons progress in difficulty to ease tanks and healers into specific mechanics. I'd say Uldaman is the first fairly difficult dungeon with a very unique final boss mechanic, bosses in virtually any order, and very tight spaces. Sunken temple is, in my opinion, the hardest of the 20-54 instances and the culmination of all the mechanics you learned previously. This is to prepare you for the 55-60 dungeons and those prepare you fit the raids. 
---
So, before Uldaman, I never expect my tank to know my mana level before he pulls. It's nice if they check but it's unlikely. However, by the time we are in Uldaman, I make it very clear that I need my mana at least 50% before he pulls, otherwise, I'll rez his ass.
---
Orange man bad.
---
Great site buts its missing consumables and the text cuts off so it could use some touch ups.
---
&lt;3 u
---
Mage gear is ugly for a while so if you want to see it less play a gnome. Good luck
---
The record will be broken im 100% sure.  Back then we didnt even have Red Bull
---
I mean, I could easily ask for another key I am sure it wouldn't be a problem. just make sure to respect the NDA.
---
That was my favorite set. It too so damn long to get the whole set but damn did it look cool.
---
You choose yourself whether or not you want to use them.
---
I honestly don't believe it would ever compete with bfa. The people who want to play this are not lovers of bfa. I do believe that it will bring back people who used to play wow and will in turn try out bfa as well.
---
I can get to level 12 as Undead in 1.5 hours, does this make me better than the average player? I'm rolling Dwarf come Classic though
---
This is brilliant! 
---
I loved leveling back in vanilla. I had several characters and could get a new alt to level 60 in about 4 weeks, even when raiding on my main.
---
This time I’m older with more commitments like job, wife, kids.....so loving the idea of just questing away on all the old favourite quest lines.
---
My favourite place was Tanaris and Ungo creator, and that fkin stealthy sneaky devilsaur t-Rex who’d sneak up on you! 😂👍
---
Does it have to be one or the other? O\_O
---
i mean, there is a place for both. Just leveling a toon while watching a good series is cool. Putting on your headphones and forgetting there is something other than WoW is cool too. One is retail, one is Vanilla.
---
On vanilla client there's a config file for all that stuff that you can copy or change directly in the file. Probably gonna be the same on classic, might be compatible with retail one, or you might have to edit it yourself. We will have the client in advance of the game coming out so you should have time to fix it then.
---
Don’t quote me. But don’t your keybinds get saved in your interface folder? If it uses the same mapping file might be able to drag and drop.
---
Played on a pserver, shit really holds up at 1080 and max graphics through console commands. Now just imagine 1440 and high res textures/models. I'm salivating already.
---
brewfest wasn't in vanilla iirc, so that's gonna change i guess
---
Why implement the honor system but not BGs at the same time?
---
Optimistic... they’ve stated a few times that sharding would greatly alleviate launch population and congestion.
---
Their way of saying they will very likely use sharding for the first week or 2.
---
Do you have any further information that “you’re aware of” but aren’t sharing?
---
Dynamic respawns mean that more mobs spawn with more people in the area. Not a *lot* more mobs. Just more than normal.
---
wasnt the battle shout aggro a bug and may not even be in classic?
---
BTW this is not my video, i just wanted to share it to spread some more info for vanilla wow raiding.
---
For me the game just stopped being fun or interesting and I figured I was just over it. I think the biggest issue is that the world just got too big with too little being relevant. I don't think Blizzard messed up anything; it's just hard to have a bunch of expansions that both add new content and keep the old content relevant. Aside from simple nostalgia, the main reason I think I might end up playing Classic for a while is that we're returning to a game where the entire world is relevant again.
---
He is talking about sustainable grinding, not killing things as fast as you can. Warlocks can absolutely blow up their target at a pace comparable to the burstiest classes, but doing so burns mana fast. Leveling in this way leads to lots of down time eating and drinking, and eventually you have to go get water somewhere which further costs time and money.
---
Affliction warlocks with Improved Life Tap, Improved Drain Life, and Improved Drain Soul can pretty much chain pull mobs forever with a mixture of DoTs, wanding, and Drain Life. This method of leveling has lower DPS but the tradeoff is that it's possible to use pretty much 0 mana to level. The lack of a need to drink for 30s every other mob saves a tremendous amount of time in the long run.
---
Actually inner fire is a very good armour buff, significantly better than Mages or Warlocks armour buffs. A priest with IF up will have more armour typically than a rogue or a druid. If you spec imp Inner Fire that would be another 5% or so which would make a priest in around the same as hunter or shamy with no shield.
---
So yes with 15% shadowform reduction as well they are very tanky to physical dps.
---
As a paladin you're pretty unkillable at 60 as holy in 1v1
---
You know I actually don't know! You might be right :o
---
Demo shout generates more aggro on many targets than Battle shout - the fixed buff threat is split across all enemies in combat, so the more enemies you are fighting, the less aggro it generates on each mob. Demo generates a fixed amount on each mob it hits though.
---
But I would still be disgusted knowing that there are people out there who use the new models
---
This sub has a Looking For Group ... Wednesday? I don't remember which day, but one day every week there's a mod post stickied where guilds and people looking for guilds make posts about what they're doing. Check last week's.
---
are there summoning stones outside all instances? irrelevant to your post but just wondering lol
---
Maybe my memory is way off but, It's 1/2 wanding anyway so I don't see why not.  Healing isn't much better in disc/holy till later levels either.
---
Naw, Druid that got lucky with a Glowing Brightwood Staff drop that I sold for 700g at level 58.
---
:O
---
Why are you here? Are you lost?
---
Between diablo 4 announcement.  Success of diablo immortal in Asia. And the massive increase in wow subs.      If I had money. I would be investing it.
---
Not at all. Incredibly excited for Classic
---
TBH duskwood looks better on retail, and arguably xroads too.
---
The lighting in duskwood looks much closer to when Blizzard had the concept of an actual day/night cycle in Vanilla where you had to use torches and camp fires and duskwood was nearly pitch black.
---
i am just gonna bind mine on like the flightpaths and autoruns. You will probably be able to save the keybind txt in the classic wow beta if we get one. I am sure that would be compatible with the final release
---
Holy shit is that how animations work in WoW nowadays? I didn't even realize that when I played, that is just the lamest thing I've ever heard. Way to take out half the flavor of picking your race.
---
Big iron fishing pole is best for alliance before stv extravaganza, took me about an hour of diving in Shadowprey village. Being a druid made it easy thankfully :)
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=6367
---
Pick healer (priest) if you want dynamic gameplay (much more interesting pve then oblivious dpsing (remember vanilla raids are not mechanicaly that hard) and pvp is where your powers of  knowedge and predictions and split second decisions how to salvaga the situation and turn the tables come into play);    
---
healing cons: you shine in group content, feeling of lonliness when farming, hard time farming mobs;    
---
challange/what  to master: how to fight 1v1 and win or atleast have a draw.    
---
    
---
Pick dps if you want to be indepentant when you go out  into the wild wide world, and have a thing for your name at the top of dpsmeter/kda.  
---
 Dps cons: you are just another dps, easily replacable and very expandable, a lot of competition for group/raid spots (espacally if you are not very sociable, well liked or skilled player); if you want to be at the top of dps meter be prepared to farm and buy alot of consumables. Challange/what to master: become a god of ganking so enemy players /who you and flee and avoid your current  zone.   
---
Pick a tank if you want to be a guild princess and an engine who make or break a raid at the same time. And if you dont mind having a second job ofc
---
I had an add-on for my keys.  Bongos I think?   I set up keybinds on one toon and then would just copy it over.   Wonder if that would work.
---
Off topic, but I read that 60-70 when TBC released took the same amount of time as 1-60 did in vanilla. True?
---
I think you mostly don't go arms because of the limited debuffs?
---
It's perfect
---
That actually happened? Fuck man the lengths some people would go to just to gank.
---
I have the OST on Spotify rolling on repeat nowadays
---
Don't forget to use sunder armor and make sure no one does any DPS until you have 5 stacks.
---
omg joana
---
Yeah. 
---
This does give me an idea though. 
---
I'm not gonna compete in this one since I don't have the time to sink in during the 3 weeks that this contest is running. However, I think I'm gonna try to go for the shortest /played time ever, by only playing with rested XP. It'll probably take me somewhere in the area of 400 days, call it a year since some of that time will be shaved off due to quest XP. But it actually will work pretty well with my busy lifestyle at the moment. Plus I can still level a main and feed this character items to speed up the levelling even more.
---
Yes there are, but they are not functional!  
---
If you want my opinion I wish they worked. I am no changes but I think this change would be good.  
---
3 person needed to summon the 2 others isn't all that bad if you ask me.
---
For raids tho it might suck because one of the great things about vanilla is the fact that people run to instances so, more pvp can happen. You see videos where people go through war just to get to UBRS/MoltenCore/BWL
---
Will you add a countdown when the release is announced?
---
Pretty good. I'll be up there with /played times :)
---
Priest PVP sets had more armor than rogues with the buff they can get more armor than your average hunter or shaman without a shield.
---
It's just the normal vocal minority you have always seen in "Barrens chat," only 2005 was a different era, where Chuck Norris and Mankrik's wife were considered memes. Now it's racism, Trump, and hate--it's a reflection of times we live in. But still, just a vocal minority in private servers--enough to /quit world though. I hope Blizzard enforces their ToS in Classic.
---
So it’s basically joanas speed level but with full rested the whole time.
---
As I remember Battle Shout in vanilla only generated threat if it is applied to a party member and not if refreshed.
---
Its great for a burst of initial threat but not for sustained agro, unless your Perry is willing to unbuff themselves eveey time you recast.
---
oh yeah i shouldve thought of that
---
And here I am just hoping by month 3 to hit 60 with my rogue.
---
I love the classic soundtrack, and in a lot of ways I find it better than the new music. That being said, I wouldn’t mind an option to have new music shuffled in. Especially if it’s just an option. I rolled a new Night Elf on retail recently and noticed that there were some new BFA tunes added to some of the starting areas and I thought that was a really nice touch. They didn’t feel as out of place as I would have expected.
---
😜
---
error 37 happened
---
Shaman. 30/0/21
---
Depends on how crowded the server is, last night I would go through spurts of being able to chain pull mobs and get about 25%ish xp in about 10min for my level (12-14), but once a horde of other players showed up to my grinding spot that speed slows to a crawl. 
---
Goodluck!
---
No. In BC? They were changed to Summoning Stones. 
---
In Classic they are just meeting stones. To meet at and designate that the entrance is nearby.
---
This happened on my warrior while leveling in TBC. Can't remember what caused it but I was permanently falling until a GM force killed me and sent me to a graveyard.
---
Lol I feel you, I just felt so stupid not knowing wtf was going on.
---
Thanks !
---
I don't even see that as a grind tbh
---
That's just the game. It is what I enjoy doing. It is how I meet plenty of strangers and go on random adventures with them.
---
*And I can still keep making my character stronger for a long time after the end of that great journey?*
---
Sign me the fuck up.
---
[Yes we did. Red Bull was founded in 1976.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull) and I sure had a shit ton of em back in the days.
---
**Red Bull**
---
Red Bull is an energy drink sold by Red Bull GmbH, an Austrian company created in 1987. Red Bull has the highest market share of any energy drink in the world, with 6.790 billion cans sold in a year (as of 2018).Austrian entrepreneur Dietrich Mateschitz was inspired by an existing energy drink named Krating Daeng, which was first introduced and sold in Thailand by Chaleo Yoovidhya. He took this idea, modified the ingredients to suit the tastes of Westerners, and, in partnership with Chaleo, founded Red Bull GmbH in 1987 in Chakkapong, Thailand. In Thai, daeng means red, and a krating (known in English as a gaur or Indian bison) is a large species of wild bovine native to South Asia.

---
Sweet Idea, that I can do!
---
I had an awesome time, so much so, that I'll never main a pure dps again. But that's only because I took the time to get to know different players and worked really hard on my reputation (both as a very competent healer and as a decent human being). If people know they can count on you to heal, regardless of how bad the wipes/drama can get, then by the time you're 30+, you can expect an invite to an instance anytime you're on. 
---
As for PvP, I never did like it with my mage but I loved it with my healer. Stealth healing especially is fun as the enemy doesn't understand why that player isn't dying. And when they do find you and go after you, it's always so nice to see your entire team rally to defend you (as opposed to playing dps... where they just watch you die).
---
You mentioned a choice between hunter and healing paladin. In my experience, these two are polar opposites. The healing paladin is a joy to have in any group and is viewed with much fanfare. The hunter is viewed with distrust and suspicion since, frankly, most hunters aren't terribly good (playing in a group that is). Add to that most hunters have the reputation for being a bit antisocial since they can solo practically anything (then again, ret paladins can too, it just takes an hour), and what you have is really a question of how do you want to be (broadly) perceived? 
---
Know that if you play a hunter, you have an uphill battle. You'll need to work incredibly hard for players to take you seriously. But once you're there, those players will be your biggest proponents.
---
And feeding items from my main.
---
Yeah the battleshout spam thing is more of a private server phenomenon, although I don't know how it works 100%. My understanding is that it only should generate threat when you are applying it fresh, but not when it is overwritten. Your targets have to be on the aggro table too.
---
You clearly missed his point.
---
I honestly doubt we will be seeing a beta. There really isnt all that much to beta test...at least not anything that would require a few thousand people.
---
Yeah I think it was like 13% more physical reduction once I cast it, now that I think about it. pretty dang good.
---
Make water first noob
---
Every race and gender in classic has their own animation.
---
You won't see an Undead male warrior crit animation the same as a female human warrior who does that jump twirl.
---
Where as in BFA: Both warriors would do the same High-jump-slam for Colossus smash
---
Rogue and war could get 325 by dual wielding the sword/dagger that give the +10 with the +5 enchant (pretty useless tho)
---
I have a $600 Acer with an HD Graphics 520 and it runs the 1.12 client on max settings at 60fps.

They're meeting stones iirc.
---
I had a level 32 Nelf hunter in vanilla. Left abandoned until Legion. Logged on and played her for a goldmaking idea I had...
---
New art, animation, etc... goddamn dem hips.
---
Not that much.
---
But it was still a long and very great journey.
---
60-70 took about 40 hours IIRC. The first people started hitting 70 the Wednesday morning after the release at about 28-30 hours played.
---
Given that before the change, you pretty much did 4 quests in a zone before having to move on to the next because you out leveled it, it was a good change tbh.
---
With that said, leveling is broken as hell, and it was an "easy" fix for a very complicated problem, and I am sure the game designers at Blizzard are very well aware of this.

You're so casual it's embarrassing ! :o

won't even be close to what is required for the current client
---
Not really mate. If you’re 60 when you hit the outlands it helps no end as the first few hours fly by. There are also a few quests that really help like the arena in nagrand. It’s been a while but from memory it felt much the same as 50-60 in regards to time. It’s also much more streamlined as they got better at positioning quest hubs etc. Take all this with a pinch of salt.
---
So 12 hours per day and I can do it in 10 days
---
Wasn't aware that WoW released in 1983
---
48 hours to bring my first character, a dwarf rogue to lvl 18. Then i rerolled to Horde, when i quit i had my shaman at 56 with 24 days played. I dont even know how that is possible.
---
honestly, I hope for them to release the game unpolished. some of the greatest things in wow (blood plague anyone?) came in unintented
---
Or I can publish the time stamped PM's with the sender's name retracted.
---
The game looked great graphics wise ten years ago, why should it be any different now? The game should not cater to people who cant appreciate good gameplay over flashy fancy graphical effects.
---
as far as i remeber, he grinded last levels. so it takes espesically long.
---
for a normal player at 58-59 you'd be doing all the 60s dungeon quests (brd, lbrs quests) and attunes, brd key quest and so on. Which all reward a ton of xp. 
---
So in reality it these last level fly much faster.
---
thats just a specials joana's condition of being so far ahead and alone on the server.
---
No Changes. This means Joana too.

Will their be separate categories for PvE &amp; PvP servers?

I need to get me one of those 4 year old bots xD
---
This is a very toxic comment. Seeing what is included in the client is very relevant. Why do you write your comments trying to be extra disrespectful?
---
You're actually retarded just for the sake of drama and outrage. There's a reason it's called a demo. Use your brain dumbfuck
---
Do not underestimate Cleave and Demo Shout.

Macro your Last Stand/Shield Wall to let your party know when you use it.

Macro/add on to tell party that Taunt was resisted.

Remember that Mocking Blow is a thing. Use it as a semi-Oh-Shit button when taunt is resisted. Only usable in B-Stance. Pray it doesn’t miss/get dodged.
---
100% with you
---
how is it delusional? seriously?
---
That wasn't water, that was dragon blood
---
Nope, just that end of the alpha timing, not much more to it.
---
&gt;The comic-like graphic of WoW has always been ridiculed by its MMORPG predecessors
---
Which is hillarious considering how horrific the older MMO's look with their 4 polygon models and barely any animations on the character.
---
Classic summer means classic will release in “summer” meaning June-September. You can look up every time Blizzard has slated a wow expansion for a “summer” release it has ended up being August or September.
---
93 is halfway to 99
---
Exactly, I had multiple revisions of this guide.
---
It's for wiping, not shitting in.
---
I can run 8.x on 1920x1080.  I don't quite get 60fps on ultra but it's still totally playable.
---
This is what I was looking for, thanks.
---
Now I might be wrong but I saw a classic options in the graphics menu. Doesn’t that mean this will be a option for classic like graphics wouldn’t that mean it would need the same processing power as the 15 year old game.
---
Most people start with bluegrass but clawhammer is insanely fun, I seriously suggest you try it. I think it's more fun. Also remember to play with picks when doing 3 finger, it'll take a while to get used to, but don't just use fingers.
---
Check male gnome with r13 set and shadowflame staff. Nuff said
---
tfw it's meant to be a historical recreaton of the game how it was and a window in time but r/wow is continually trying to bastardize the project at this point I've given up, they'll keep screeching until the modern features take precedent over the old
---
&gt;Could be a holdover they didn't remove yet, game could break if they don't exist.
---
Pretty sure the game just defaults to some standard model to use for anything it cannot load.
---
If you are fine with strictly emulating 1.12 then sure. A lot of procs and other server side stuff were changed by the time 1.12 rolled out.
---
You really think they would go back and redesign every model in the game in HD?
---
Hint: No.

This exactly what I've tried to talk about but each time I was either brigaded or downvoted. If they're not going to make this as they promised, a historical recreation of the game as it was, warts and all. A window in time that someone waking from a coma would notice no difference in, then they had better tell us now. I don't want to wait around for classic +. I'd prefer to know what's happening so I can move on.
---
When I was gifted my banjo they have me picks with it.
---
I'll have to see what I can learn about clawhammer playing then. I guess I shouldn't discount it before trying it!
---
As a hunter, rogue or warrior you can actually get 325 skinning with ZG.
---
Are there going to be RP/PVP Servers?
---
Every NPC?  No, but the ones that use the player races would use the new models.  But they said all the NPCs.
---
Agreed. Hahaha.
---
Will definitely use your guide when classic launches I remember watching those old speed leveling vids lol
---
It will be nice for some stuff for sure, but the vast majority of PS problems are encounter scripting and server mechanics which Classic won't actually help with at all, so there will still be a huge difference Classic and PSers in the future.
---
That’s why you’re supposed to set focus to the healer and check after each engagement.  :O
---
Let's talk about the noob healer that cast a spell just as the warrior pulled with his measly bow of the sick owl (bonus point if it's the group stam buff, massive threat).
---
The warrior has done something like 50 damage on one mob but the healer is now at the top of the threat list of every mob in the group ...
---
This is why I'll roll a DPS in Classic. This is a joy to tank or heal (I've done both) with good players, but it turns to nightmare when you are with noobs that think they're good.
---
I still have PTSD of bad PUGs !!! I remember wiping in RFC !!! :D
---
It affects the respawn timer of the region / zone.
---
Classic had 6.5 minute respawn timers. Pservers have 5 minute respawn timers. AOE mages beat the shit out of everyone else with that 20% faster respawn.
---
Some who ask for dynamic respawn are asking for a sliding scale that has 1 minute on the fast end, and then down to ~5.
---
Why the fuck would I do any quests if I could hang out in a cave and camp 2 mobs once a minute?
---
but, are there any corpses that require more than 315?
---
not a druid, though
---
Thank you for your thoughtful response. I have to admit on the cosmetic level I don't feel particularly strongly either way, but if it has the potential to become an actual balance issue, which I had not realised it might, then obviously it's a no go.
---
But the upkeep on those though D:
---
Wouldn’t the top levellers in /played be people that only level with rested xp pooled up?
---
That would disrupt my Netflix and Auto
---
Has this been confirmed to be in classic yet?  Or is it one of those little unintended bugs they’re patching out?
---
Seems to dance the line of being in 1.12 and an element of Vanilla but also being something Blizzard never intended.
---
At the end of the video there are a bunch of animated mini clips of Naxx, the battles going on, etc. I’m not familiar with these, what are they?
---
More of a TBC talent point.
---
It doesnt have to be large changes at all. Just a very minor change is all it takes. When you on your own screen fit your character perfectly into a little hiding spot, but the new models make other players barely able to see you then thats absolutely gamebreaking.
---
Makes me think of one of the earlier versions of Counterstrike where you could set your graphics to a particular setting which allowed you to see through smoke clouds. It forced everyone to do it if they wanted to be at an equal level to everyone else, and ended up limiting choice, not increasing it.

---
What a terrible reply.
---
I don't really know if we're talking about HD player models or HD textures, these are quite different imo.
---
For player characters models : Because it's your character, simple as that. It's not for nothing if you start the game by creating your own avatar. It's a representation of who you want to be in the virtual world, and is the first impression you give to other players. In a true MMO you should have your own identity as a player. You're not just a random number, you have an impact on others and that's what makes you take part in a social world.
---
However for graphics and how the world looks, I don't mind at all a toggle for HD. We're in 2019 and if Blizz has the opportunity to satisfy people who have a powerful computer so they don't waste their performance, then so be it. I don't really see how I could be affected by that.

Wild Feeding: Your pet hunts, grazes, or forages for food (depending on type).  Provides happiness equivalent to the highest level and quality food your pet is eligible to consume.  Will not work in areas with no sources of food.
---
As I understand it, all buffing causes threat
---
So the more people getting buffed, the more aggro you get. Same with other classes that buffs
---
I think it was in vanilla, because I think one of the ways to tank twin emperors, was with warriors using different shouts (I didn’t tank back then, just think I heard about it back when we did them)
---
By level 12, you’ll have like 10 abilities that need a key bond. Do your keybinds on the run from Mulgore/Durotar/Hillsbrad to Xroads.
---
I just tanked deadlines with anger management, it was really nice getting that extra tic of rage in between autos I noticed about 5-6 times in DM that it helped.
---
 I then tanked stockades it really shined there because of all the ranged pulls, again I noticed it about 5-6 times where it helped but stocks is a shorter dungeon. 
---
Five percent crit might be better for rage generation at lower levels, but anger management is much more reliable. I still plan to level and tank as arms, i really like it
---
 *Like many others have said how you are percieved in game is important to players.* Having a character not look as their player intends does in fact alter the dynamics of a social game. People reacting to the so-called “rape  face” dwarf in the classic WoW discord is one of many examples. People  make comments on how my character looks in game all the time regardless  of what I play and vice-versa, so how you look matters. The fact that so  many people in this thread don’t understand that and just say *“well you’re ruining the way I want to play the game”* as though you’re entitled to something extraneous to vanilla and it doesn’t matter is genuinely laughable. 
---
Modern WoW has taken artistic liscense the portray the races differently.   
---
 The biggest difference would be gnomes. Gnomes look like happy fellas in  classic rambling about their muderous rampage. In todays WoW they look  grumpy and sad with huge drooping eyes and lachrymal sacs like a basset  hound. The broader examples across the spectrum that I can think of is the difference between WC3 and  WC3 ‘remastered’, the original cinematic  rc/human from WoW to the MoP orc/human or the modern games architecture, weapon sizes and armour to old WoW. Simple NPCs like Scarlet Crusaders. 
---
Don’t even get me started on the animations and why people suddenly  think a project, a museum project with the sole purpose of restoring the  game exactly as it was, should be sidelined in such a way that Classic  content takes a backseat.
---
Yep. Just look at all the shit that is contained in the Vanilla 1.12 client. You have half of Karazhan, parts of Hellfire peninsula, Programmer Island, Designer Island, Emerald Dream etc etc etc. None of that content is ever used but its right there in the client.
---
WoW tokens wont be a thing, but there will always be an underground gold-selling market. Both from overseas websites and from enterprising players on your server.
---
Upvoted for The Expanse reference.
---
I relate to this on a fucking spiritual level.
---
Yes I know rested XP is an issue.  That is why I say those times must be submitted within the first 3 weeks of Classic WoW launch.  This will help to minimize the amount of rested XP used.
---
No, they used old models, old animations and old textures in the BlizzCon demo. I don't know if there was any new model data, but it was not visible in the actual game.
---
Yeah 43-45 always felt like the half way point.
---
You do realize resisting time lapse is generally considered extremely bad? :D
---
The more you know :)
---
Getting asscandy on my hunter is one of my main goals in classic, one shotting clothies with raptor strike is immensly satisfying.
---
Drink the Coolaid. Dont read the report, Fox has you covered. Ignore the fact that collusion isn't even a legal term as stated in Article 1, page 1 of the report. Obstruction was proved in both Article 1 and 2. Again, ignore the reality and listen to Fox to feel good!
---
Because you can't do that if the scale is tuned well enough. Dynamic raspawns should only kick in for when an area has 40+ people and should never kick in for zones over level 40.
---
Fire resist is very useful on Firemaw for tanks and to some degree melee DPS if you dont have the gear to just burn the boss asap.
---
I think it happened in the pre patch between wod and legion, when they revamped animations. For warrior at least every race uses the exact same for every single ability except bloodthirst is based on your race but all others are the exact same.
---
As a priest, you intersect with all the classes, you usually realize that warlock needs the cloth gear, that druid needs the healing gear. As a mage however, you don't usually think of a Paladin taking your gear, there just isn't a really obvious crossover between them.
---
Oh i agree with that and it is usually a learning process for most. Doesn't bother me to die, not fun but not the end of the world. I will probably be a noob for a few days as I relearned my priest
---
I would like people to see me playing a character I made, not some random assortment of options. Because that's what my characters turned into when I switched the new model toggle in WoD - some random face with a barely similar hairstyle and the same hair color. I've identified with those characters and I would like others to identify me with them as well.

Name: Elemental Strike
---
Required Level: 30
---
Mana Cost: 10% base mana

Cooldown: 15 seconds

Requires Melee Weapon, Lightning Shield
---
Instant, Melee Range
---
Charges your melee weapon with lightning, granting you an extra attack.  In addition consumes 1 charge of your lightning shield and inflicts one charge worth of damage to your target. Cannot be used if insufficient charges are present.
---
Rogues can start at 2-3 stacks. They don't have threat problems and can always feint if they crit hard, or even vanish
---
I wish I understood why, it’s the stupidest change ever. Especially with allied races coming into play “race fantasy” should be even more of a thing now.
---
They got all their tracks on Spotify so if you get bored of the classic ones I would just mute in game and throw their playlist on shuffle
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuRX38ekNU8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuRX38ekNU8)
---
&gt;I usually tell my DPS not to do damage until after I Thunderclap. Gives you a couple of seconds to secure aggro.
---
Oh, I am not looking forward to Retail players ignoring that advice.
---
I agree with you, I also think they will go through the expansions, at least tbc and wrath, but I think they’re going to have them as stand alone games with different characters for each one.
---
Priest cast shield. Your only rage is from one weapon swing on a mob because you used a gun to pull a patrol group. Dps decides to attack 3 different mobs in the pull.
---
Ah yeah I just read that you already addressed that and was about to delete this lol. Sounds like a reasonable solution.
---
Human male running animation looks like he's tip-toe-ing in a children's cartoon.
---
I think it's in the category of things that were popularised during private servers and no one really knows if it wasn't a thing in actual Vanilla either because of a slight (or major) difference in the way it worked, or because just no one figured it out.  
---
Same as many boss fight strategies, MCP feral druid use, hamstring kiting, some consumable/debuff stacking, some downranked coefficients, rep gains etc.
---
I tend to be in the camp that Private Servers are actually very good and are very close on the important stuff, but when people have been playing on them/making them for 10 years with no reference there's bound to be a few big differences that we were just unaware of.
---
Must have been triplets then cause mine is exactly the same!
---
Focus wasn't a thing in Vanilla
---
Imagine not having the brain capacity to work out what karlsberg69 meant.
---
Main have over 300 days and about 150 day’s on alts!
---
Back then I played all the time.
---
Nope!
---
The whole “data mining craze” has done nothing possible over the past week.
---
The “beta” everybody was getting excited about turned out to be a closed alpha for employees and friends/family of blizzard employees.
---
“Data mining” is getting one puzzle piece and trying to guess what the puzzle picture is. 
---
It’s literally the dumbest thing ever. These music files, CLASSIC MUSIC IN CLASSIC WOW!
---
How about we stop trying to make news when there is no news....
---
Depends if youre familiar with speedleveling and plan on rolling a hunter. Spreading the time out a bit will give a small boost in rested xp but that wont matter as much as not being completely ahead of the pack like joanna was.When youre the only one leveling in an entire zone then the xp per hour is very strong considering the ability to always kill mobs when moving towards quest hubs or quest locations.
---
race: orc, profession: engineering and mining
---
No Russian interference stated by your own corrupt Mueller. No obstruction was proven, even says lacks evidence.

Faux News is Fake News too. NPC’s gonna NPC. He’s still your president.

&gt;I think it's in the category of things that were popularised during private servers and no one really knows if it wasn't a thing in actual Vanilla either because of a slight (or major) difference in the way it worked, or because just no one figured it out.
---
This is just untrue. I know this is just a personal anecdote, but my guild in Vanilla never used Warlocks to tank Twin emperors in AQ. Our strategy was just having the Warrior on the side of the caster twin spam battleshout over and over until they switched places again.
---
If Battleshout did not produce threat, our strategy would not have worked.
---
Get him some WoW LEGO like a good bro
---
Whats your twitch situation? I miss watching your stream!!!!
---
Min maxing would be utilizing your time on flightpaths to do IRL things to not waste time on them later. Ie: quick power nap, bathroom, eating / preparing food
---
but you burned out after this. and if some enemy camp you half a day your speed record is lost
---
Yeah it’s going to suck. I was thinking of making a /p macro to use at the start of every dungeon. 
---
“DPS, please do not deal damage until after my Thunderclap. I am sure that we do not want to wipe. Slow and Steady will actually win this race. Let’s have a great run!”
---
Well, yeah, but the new one has some weird tilt to it or something where it looks like they're perpetually falling forward.
---
Holy shot dude. I remember your guides, great to see your still around to this day :)
---
A lot of people start playing 3 finger but then they try clawhammer and it's so addictive. Learn a few 3 finger styles but then try clawhammer. It's really fuckin fun!
---
Seriously, that's a thing? Why have I never heard of priests stacking agi before?
---
Having a rp-pvp realm available will be a large portion of the deciding factor of me playing classic. I won’t play on a pve realm, but I find that pvp realms attract a lot of the counterstrike mentality people. 
---
In my experience rp-pvp realms seem to avoid that, so they get the advantage of open world pvp but a lot less of the “OMG I’m so leet u suxx I gank u all day”  people. 
---
And a bit of rp can be fun.
---
Battle shout? Hahahahhahah
---
Nah, you don't know how to tank
---
Like Nefarion, and Twin Imps! Stack them with hunters and you’ll never pull threat, ever.
---
The models all pretty much LOOK better, but they still have some issues that I'm not sure how they overlooked like the shoulders and super stretched cloaks.
---
"Yeah I'd say that last boss looked pretty cool"
---
"Oh yeah? What did he look like?"
---
-Every healer
---
lolwat?
---
I drank a shit ton of Monster while leveling in Vanilla. The day I was going to hit 60, switched it up to Sparks.
---
&gt;Yeah the battleshout spam thing is more of a private server phenomenon, although I don't know how it works 100%. My understanding is that it only should generate threat when you are applying it fresh, but not when it is overwritten. Your targets have to be on the aggro table too.
---
Not true. My guild in 2006 tanked Twin emps without Warlocks. This was only possible by spamming Battleshout over and over as the twin is immune to physical attacks.
---
Video from one of our kills:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdNBnjf04vc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdNBnjf04vc)

Fair point!

It’s not a hot girl singing it.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdNBnjf04vc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdNBnjf04vc) 
---
Video showing twins using no warlock tanks.
---
Yes it does.
---
I know you did the maths but it doesn’t make much sense to me. Would it not just be a 10% damage increase on wands? So like a 5% damage boost if you want from like 50% hp?
---
if you check in the comments a guy post about his og vanilla days how tanks in the group would spam it nonetheless. Idk about the veracity and I also only played vanilla on pservers but still. Might be worth a look who knows.
---
Summer is 2 months away.  The end of summer is 5 months away.
---
&gt;As I remember Battle Shout in vanilla only generated threat if it is applied to a party member and not if refreshed.
---
False.
---
If that was the case, tanking twins by spamming battleshout would not work, as can be seen here:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdNBnjf04vc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdNBnjf04vc)
---
The only thing that I really want them to do is a stress test so they can test how big the shards should be at launch. Maybe just make it a 1-20 "demo" instead of 10-20 just to see how it's gonna go.
---
Depends entirely on populations. People are hitting ~16.5 hour runs 1-30 on the most blizzlike Pserver available, but that's a completely solo server and a Hunter, so Warlock would be slightly slower. 20 hours should be totally doable though.
---
&gt; I am no changes but I think this change would be good.
---
Disagree. It would directly devalue Warlock utility, and it would promote a culture of slacking.
---
I distinctly remember sitting to get crit as a geared  warrior tank to generate rage.
---
I can also vouch that they did, had a couple of GMs appear to me through my time
---
For me scripting and server mechanics aren't the biggest problems on PS. Botting, selling gold, drama, unsafety and corrupted gms, servers with p2w shops ... are the reasons for me to avoid PS. Classic wont change this problems on PS. The level of scripting and content in general may go up but you can't fix thise kind of problems.
---
Who said that people that watch these videos aren't true vanilla fans?
---
Someone can not understand why someone else does something but still respect their right to do it.
---
Oh wow, that's pretty unfortunate then. I think I never ended up looking close enough to notice since it kept the wonkiness of the old models too and I just quickly gave up on them.
---
Funny I edited my post at the exact time you replied. It does sound like it was a legit strat back then, I guess it was just something that wasn't particularly well known by most guilds throughout vanilla. I considered myself a pretty knowledgeable warrior back then and tried to keep up on the all the current theorycrafting, but I never heard about the battle shout thing.
---
LOS pull then throw grenade at feet, very efficient on large packs
---
\&gt;not having mom bring tendies
---
Get
---
Out
---
Not usable in defensive stance which means you have to go Battlestance and risk losing any rage you have above what can be retained with tactical mastery.
---
Your best options are either to mark a skull on some caster mob and ignore that mob completely, equip engineering shield for the first few seconds of the pull, or stack every mob on top of each other with a los pull and use a sapper charge or dynamite on top of everything.
---
Are you still In touch with any of the current gm’s?
---
It seems to be a lot more of a job and less of a vocation now days.
---
Also, can you get the inside scoop on what kind of servers are coming out on release?
---
(Fingers crossed for a rp-pvp server)
---
Lag, if you're not from EU
---
This isnt true though, Unless you want a 5 hour run
---
The fun with rogues is to end up at 41 and gank low areas.
---
Yes!
---
Given the threat modifiers and not having the ability to use Tclap in def stance, demo shout causes more agro than Tclap.
---
Dps should be maintaining Tclap of anyone.
---
Exactly. The AoE threat of battleshout is often misunderstood. Well said mate! 
---
One thing to add, is that it generates said threat depending on the amount of people in your party that you buff. If folks are out of range = less threat gen. 
---
For me, this make demo shout a bit more reliable.
---
I love Mad Season because, even though it's very clear he is a big vanilla fan, he doesn't suck vanilla's cock. He is very real about vanilla and retail and respects everyone's right to play the game that they want without bashing either side. It's refreshing. People are allowed to enjoy retail.
---
&gt; Battle Shout is a great AoE Threat generator for you
---
This is, by the way, the reason why Warrior tanks are better AoE tanks than Prot Paladins. ;)
---
On the last Pserver i played i lvled enchanting up to 300 while i was lvl 52, it wasnt a good idea
---
You know that is a valid argument. I did play a warlock to 60 and raided a bit on a pserver. It did annoy me a bit to see lazy people chilling while I had the responsibility to get there to summon.   
---
Yeah overall it probably is a small discomfort to get through instead of promoting a culture of slacking.   
---
:)
---
Sounds like you don’t know how to tank, it’s good initial aoe threat.
---
Took me 19 day's /played (456 hours) to get my Warlock to 60 back in vanilla, with no addons and it being my first mmo rpg.
---
I am sure I will do it atleast at double the speed of then though.
---
Everyone knows the first to 60 will be a meth addict.
---
Can you post examples?
---
But what about the mage that sent the frostbolt in before your arrow that hits for 4 reached the mob?
---
You realize this is an alpha? They are still working on it and removing Legion client stuff. Guild banks are also in the files, but there won't be guild banks because it's clearly is NOT a vanilla feature.
---
It’s not strictly about the aggro though. I say Thunderclap because of the sound and the visual. It’s a very obvious signal for the DPS. The attack speed debuff is what I really liked about it.
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I quickly hopped onto the K3 ptr server to show you, I just bought some grey cloth items from vendor at the Crossroads, I'd normally have Darkwood Staff [https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=3446](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=3446) and usually a few other random greens by now, however without them I did struggle to pull 6 mobs because I can't use mana on R1 frost bolt to pull more efficiently 
---
[https://plays.tv/video/5cbb89f83562d50a63/wowee](https://plays.tv/video/5cbb89f83562d50a63/wowee)
---
I made a mistake at 0:26 briefly strafing into melee range taking extra damage, it shouldn't have been so close, and with greens it wouldn't have been either. However 6 mobs might be a stretch until level 16 or so, I think 4 mobs is the sweet spot, not too risky and usually you can round up 4 mobs pretty easily.
---
I also never said to AoE farm instead of questing at level 14, I said to do in on the way to quests instead of sitting at full hp and mana, pull a pack of mobs on the way and AoE them down, don't even drink afterwards just keep heading to your quest, its just making good use of your resources.
---
Exactly. It is absolutely annoying to play with asians on a server who don't speak a word English. I'm neither a nativ english speaker nor am I realy good. But some sort of basic communication is necessary.  
---
And don't get me started with the server progression.
---
It's so much bait that I mentioned it at towards the end of a 25 minute video and put nothing in the title about it?
---
I sense you're getting frustrated with this dialogue so I'd suggest we just agree to disagree :)
---
They had a stress test already essentially...it was the Demo. The shards were a bit too small at the start, but by the end they seemed to have opened them up more.
---
Joanas’ is black and is hollow and is cold....
---
idk, then probably it was new shader or something. That looked quite awkward, textures didn't fit models
---
Aye so this happened to me whilst playing on my first toon, an orc hunter around level 25ish, back in classic. Was questing in stonetalon mountains, died and ended up in this floating hellhole. I recall seeing the spirit healer now and then, and sometimes flying close enough to almost talk to her and accept a ress sickness. However, as I was a wee lad at the time and had no clue I could contact a GM about the whole ordeal, I ended up quitting the toon and simply creating a new one.
---
Logged back onto my hunter maybe a year later and found myself alive, but with all broken gear, in a graveyard in hillsbrad foothills. Had never been to hillsbrad before and simply rejoiced over the fact that I could continue playing as a hunter once more.
---
I mean, it technically is 1.12 code, not just content. Just the algorithms had to change to make it fit the modern client.
---
Question: can you make a macro where you cast a “stance” + a spell, or does it have to be two different actions?
---
**TL;DR toggle is bad here's why**
---
We had a toggle on retail for years. It was a buggy heap of shit that didn't work.
---
Off the top of my head:
---
* The "old models" weren't the old models, they were some weird cross between old and new. Did not look right at all.
---
* The "old models" still used modern, updated animations. Needless to say, the two aren't compatible. Did not look right at all.
---
* The "old models" had tons of graphical issues, from weird faces and buggy hair styles, to EXTREME clipping. And I mean EXTREME. Blizz re-sized weapons and moved a bunch of the armor pieces around to fit the new models, which meant helmets and stuff weren't even ON your character anymore if you used the old models. They were fucked.
---
* Night Elves and Blood Elves didn't even have an old model. One day they just straight up disappeared but no one noticed or complained because no one used them anyway.
---
* In Legion they straight up removed the option altogether. Again, no one noticed or complained because no one used them anyway.
---
So few people used the old model toggle at the time (I bet most people reading this didn't even know they removed it) that no one realizes how bad it was and how many problems it introduced. The players had a clear favorite (in this case it was the new models) and the alternative (the old models) fell by the wayside and became a horrid amalgam of bugs and neglect, until they were so fucked that Blizz went "Ew" and cut them out entirely.

Epic mount is the first thing and then bis for raids
---
Demo generates threat the first time its used, and it adds mitigation. Win win. I don’t think spamming it works though, but I’m open to correction. 
---
Also, blood rage or berserker rage, whatever the one that gives extra rage over 20 or so seconds generates minor threat too.

First things first.
---
Nostalgia, we all know.
---
I'm hoping for a beta invite - I'll do a nostalgic run there, then play normally on live
---
I assume it is possible. If switching stance triggers a global cooldown, then the macro is a bit harder to make. I have no idea if Blizzard will use their "more recent" macro system/language instead of the old one used in vanilla and pservers.  
---
Interesting question.  
---
If it is the newer system I'm pretty sure it is possible, as for the older one idk how.

I used to have a shit PC that could barely handle WoW and would put my stereo on in my room because I didnt want to overload with ANY programs but WoW.
---
Now I have a monster rig with dual 24inch monitors. The "grind" is most welcome. The past couple years I've stuck to more fast paced and twitchy games like FPS and DotA2, so I'm really looking forward to playing a game where I can rewatch Game of Thrones or The Office or even check out a new movie I havent seen before without feeling like I'm half assing the game.

Reddit images on mobile are broken at the moment, yes. I'm referring to the link which is in the original post, and which I linked for you again in the previous comment. I'll link it a third time here as well:

name and server of your char ?

Inner focus is a 3 min cd, dp is a 3 min cd. They go hand in hand in my head
---
Really makes it sound like there's more of a difference compared to dps/tanks than it really is imo. Dps players spend a lot of time looking at ability cooldowns and their own resource bars to get their rotations correct, and tanks, well.. they see a lot of boss feet up close.
---
Leveling is what I'm looking forward too the most!
---
In pvp situations i used inner focus for mindblasts :)

I'm to lazy to search, but you can find plenty of discussion around sit-critting.

There has been no danger in Wow questing for over a decade, scaling didn't suddenly change that.

I'm on pc and those example images don't load for me.

Those subs must feel really young as this one feels like it's populated by 12 year olds half the time.

Yea.. u can just use taunt on dung dung bosses problem solved
---
The name was Nahzgul (I think that’s how it’s spelled) and I don’t remember the server I used to play on
---
Lol tank on your warrior? More like tank on my shaman!
---
With 40 people there will be a lot of wiggle room. People already know the fights and they could be done with a mix of greens/blues as long as you weren’t the tank. Having a few sp’s instead of a extra ele shaman/ret paladin/balance druid won’t make much difference

Not loading for me on desktop. Upon further inspection my browser is trying to access the image through localhost directory. You basically put a link to where it is on your computer but not the actual image itself it looks like.

I may be crazy here - but I think the biggest problem with sharding is never encountering the people you encounter again, so stick with me for a second. What if sharding ONLY included players from your server? I feel like this wouldn't be nearly as immersion breaking as the current implementation in retail. In fact I think I'd be alright with that as long as it was only around for the first 2-3 weeks in the first few starting zones - after which sharding is never active on the server again because it's just really not needed. 
---
The primary reason Blizz wants to do sharding is to alleviate the load on the early zones because it's going to be a fucking zoo of people camping the same scorpid in the valley of trials for instance. So if the areas are packed with enough players on a given server to justify sharding surely there's no need to mix server populations at all.
---
If Blizz stuck to a model like this I wouldn't complain, but that's a big if on the basis that the sharding does not stick around and doesn't extend to areas beyond level 20. I believe the vast majority of the playerbase will not make it past level 15 before the population starts to diverge into a trickle of players levelling at different speeds.
---
Fixed now, sorry about that guys.
---
Mount - MC/Onyxia Attunements - Pre-BiS Gear - Professions - Reputation/Gold Farm
---
I must be poor but I don’t see anything costing 1k as budget!
---
I dont think epic mount should be priority at all imo. It's definitely nice to have but not more important to pre bis. I'd say pre bis first and foremost. If you plan on raiding. Epic mount just makes it faster for you to get around. But a 40 man raid will have to wait for some ppl who have normal mounts anyways so the epic mount doesn't really help if you are mainly looking to raid
---
Haha! Just make sure you don't get covered by an avalanche and wake up 500 years later by a bunch of athiest and otters :)
---
Yep the most common method was to use Warlocks. If I recall we only had one Warlock who managed to do the tanking which is why we went with the Battleshout strat.
---
Fixed it now, thanks :)
---
I think the first link is him! Now that I see the server name Kil’Jaeden it is ringing a bell. I still have access to my original account but don’t see him associated with my account. Is there a way to have him restored?
---
I ended up binding /sit to S on my keyboard just for that.
---
Like I said, you have plenty of other options. If keep respawning on top of the rogue over and over again, it's not a design issue, it's a user issue.
---
Gotta love them crits
---
Funny enough once you get some experience with an encounter I find healing to be the role that best knows what's up. Like if someone is taking damage when they shouldn't be you can instantly recognize how and why.
---
the character restore thing was added in cata, so i dont think you can go that way. im afraid if you deleted him, he might be gone
---
In all my days of Pservers I feel sad that I've never had a shaman tank. I heard the legends and stories but I remain a disbeliever.
---
Yep. Still will be. Pocket those bis boe items to sell later
---
**Paladin**

Imbue your next autoattack with holy power dealing 75% weapon damage + 40% of attack power holy damage.
---
Can not activate Seal effects.
---
This should honestly have gold. The second you have this, the culture is set that there's an option to be a dick.
---
I definitely didn’t delete him but that is good to know. I’ll try contacting blizzard and see what they say. Thanks for your help!
---
Well, if you farm dungeons for your pre bis you’ll get gold towards your epic Mount and the better gear you have the faster you’ll be able to grind gold.
---
Nobody wants to look like a hobo on a small Mount but it’s really not necessary straight away.
---
Orc warrior here
---
100% agree with your stance.
---
So nice to know that at blizz GMs had the right idea back in the day!
---
With the changes to pvp server rulesets which were in part due to such complaints i guess its up for debate if they do now... though thats neither here nor there.
---
Thank you for your insight, this entire thread has been very interesting.
---
happy to help, i hope it all turns out in a possitive way :)
---
It really depends on what you want to do with that character and *when* you hit 60. 
---
Epic mount is always a good thing to start working on regardless of what you want to do, but *how* you do that depends on the state of the server and what phase we're on when you hit 60. If you're a speed leveler, then you'll probably outpace the economy (no one will have money to buy expensive things on the AH) and some of the content for the popular gold farming isn't released in Phase 1. 
---
If your focus is raiding, then start working on your pre-BiS. Lots of instance runs.
---
If you want to hang out with friends, then start helping them get to 60. 
---
If you have crafting professions, get to work on the rep grinds for their patterns.
---
Farm. There's more than just gold and rep. Depending on class, professions, etc, you'll need mats for *something* so get to work on those.
---
Want to PvP? Well, if you've hit 60 before Phase 2, then there isn't a ton to do except get your professions in order (engineering is the popular PvP profession) and get your gear shored up. 
---
If you haven't found the right guild yet, then now is the time to do it. Talk to people you group with for dungeons during your various farming runs. If you're a speed leveler, the only people that will be 60 will be the more serious ones who are likely to have the raid intentions that you do, so start working with them.
---
Acer Nitro 5. Great laptop for less than $800.
---
Frankly if you just let the tank build a bit of agro before you start healing and run towards him if you have a mob on you that should be good enough.
---
&gt; ?
---
Your character might have been transferred off your account.
---
When "Scroll of Resurrection" it was a common thing for botters to buy those accounts and merge them under a new battle.net Account. People basicallly got a leveled char for free with some achievements so it doesn't look as much of a bot. 
---
Account sellers got the account info from hacks.
---
If your character has been transferred off your account, you should be able to see that in your account transfer statistics. 
---
This article should help: https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/5493601059
---
You could ask a gamemaster if you know the server and the name of your char. So def. make sure Nahzgul from Kil'jeaden was really your char, otherwise they can't assist. 
---
Good Luck!
---
Having a community. I used to know most active players on my server through pvp and dungeons and those times still stick with me.  This instant dungeon queue cross realm crap ruined the community, I can’t wait to populate my friends list with good tanks and bg players again.
---
If you just want to make gear for yourself, take Engineering, or whatever armor you wear. I had a good time as a rogue with tribal leatherworking.
---
Very interesting!
---
What is your opinion on warmode ??
---
My server was famous in eu for its open world pvp and warmode has kinda shit on that tradition, at least that is the general consensus from our community. 
---
They did state one reason for warmode was due to players being 'stuck' on pvp servers for social reasons who did not wish to pvp. 
---
I'd say if there was such a person search for friends who can help like you say but it appears they changed their stance from back then.. sadly..
---
Also,
---
what are the benefits of felhunter vs succubus for pvp?
---
and how often did nightfall proc?
---
I had the same problem during the free weekend, I went on to the forums and it lets you choose which character you want to post as, with the server theyre on listed.
---
Apparently I took a free transfer off Kul Tiras to Bonechewer at some point during late WotLK or early Cata that I have absolutely no memory of.
---
Roll a dwarf.
---
Sigh
---
Still not sure between horde and alliance, but I'm pala/shaman fo sho.
---
&gt; They have a running log of almost all the exploits/bugs and know how to re-create them.
---
All the bugs and exploits are already patched, they're using the modern source code. I imagine any bugs that are present will be new bugs that pop up from combining old data with new engine.
---
This seems in bad taste, even if accurate
---
Seconds?? Dont mind if i do.
---
Might as well just set up your battle station in your bathroom and use the toilet as the gaming chair. Even better, put your microwave on the sink and a minifridge of pizza rolls below. That's all you need to grind to 60.
---
Type your search into YouTube and enjoy. There are videos for both of your questions. 
---
Overall you can say shockadin is at least interesting in vanilla pvp and shami tanking is possible and fun with a bit of dedication till LBRS.
---
That's a gamble. You might die and never be able to play classic wow!
---
In US, it is a free country and Joana’s guide is the religion I follow.
---
Did this in DM:E with my priest. Spam Holy Nova on each lasher group. +Herbalism and it was a decent farm. I think you needed 6k mana to pull it off which you could get before 60 with +into gear so you could farm and get decent xp.
---
Who thought HQ models were going to make it in?
---
dont forget to like and subscribe
---
Best have one hell of a comfy toilet
---
I thought Battle shout only gave treath if your party didn't already have it, so re applying it won't give treath, am I wrong? I honestly don't know.
---
On the day Classic releases I'll be home again. It's going to be surreal to go back to WoW's humble roots when the community was warm and friendly. I've missed it. 
---
I also won't be rushing, I'll take my sweet time to level since that's the part I anticipate most. Hopefully I meet some people to experience Classic with, right now I don't know anybody who wants to play. 😢
---
I kind of like the HD models, there's bound to be usermade mods to enable them.
---
Yes. Having to coordinate with a group to clear out rooms full of mobs, since aggroing too many alone will mean certain death. Finding groups for elite quests will also be great fun. Can't wait ❤️
---
They nerfed it at least once in vanilla, around the time of 1.7. They might've buffed it and nerfed it a few times.
---
Nah ye aren't
---
I actually thought of that but I love horde with all my heart! Good advice tho Blind becomes doodoo
---
Theres nothing stopping people doing it. If we look at pservers though, low level BGs in general are very unpopular, so theres not much for twinks to queue for.
---
That kind of sounds like they're future proofing the client a bit...
---
I'm playtesting for a dev who has been working on an improved next gen pserver core for the last few years. So yes, we will get better private servers.
---
Thanks man, works now!
---
Hi, /u/dispencer
---
As much as I’d love for this to be true, retail caters to newbs and there are A LOT of newbs. Wouldn’t surprise me if the retail community united for keeping the game simple. Lol
---
Don't be the virgin sunder spammer. Sunders are for fury warriors. Be the chad Heroic Strike/Cleave tank who uses TC and Demo Shout for AoE threat and get's a cleave hit on every mob within 3 seconds of pulling.
---
Be that guy. Don't be the sunder guy.
---
&gt; Im *still* a shareholder
---
FTFY
---
Rock on, thanks for reminding me it was possible. Rolling a holy priest main in Classic, so that'll be a good way to get some cash this time around.
---
Nightfall is 4% per time that corruption ticks. So pretty low. But in pvp when you can throw corruption on 3-4 players or more and on pets quite often. 
---
Fel Hunter has an offensive and defensive purge (one or the other depending on if you use it on yourself or an enemy) so it can be useful for getting rid of say, fear/sheep or improved counterspell. It also has paranoia passive which greatly increases stealth so you can catch rogues/druids slot easier before they opening. Also tons of magic (maybe only shadow?) resist. They also have their own counterspell ability. So really good for casters basically. 
---
Succubus has more dps and most important of all, her charm. Say you get opened on by a rogue. Your succubus (which is invis until she attacks) then charms right away for 10 secs. So you basically negate the rogue opener. Walk away slowly... Cast a shadowbolt/corruption into fear. And go from there. Get stunned or blinded? Charm again. In a 2v1? Succy charms one, you dot and fear the other and blow him up. Succy is all about the extra cc. It's what makes locks so good at 1v1 imo. Hunter? Fear Hunter charm pet, blow up hunter. Or other way around. Pretty sure locks run succy like 90% of the time in pvp. Succy is not that great in tbc where there's arenas because you don't need the extra cc, most the silence and dispell the del Hunter provides. But this is classic. 
---
Voidwalker can also come in clutch as his special ability (besides taunts for pve/lvling) is a big ass shield. Well it's a big ass shield now. I know it's solid in classic but not sure how big it is. But the other 2 are more importance n the majority of situations.
---
Dread it. Run from it. Chain pulls while the healer’s oom still arrive.
---
The main problem I have with a toggle setting is that bleeding edge min/maxers, especially in PvP, will find SOME miniscule advantage to using one over the other and if there is any advantage (animations can be an advantage by making certain things more obvious and allowing a faster reaction time), then people will feel forced to use one over the other, even if it isn't what they want.
---
IMO I still have fun watching a series and mindlessly grinding or farming in Vanilla, but the kicker for me is the community. It's just non existent in retail and very lively in Vanilla/Classic.
---
If you plan to make a overpowered best in slot one you have to be lucky or creative to get your loot, since there is no xp stop function.
---
The flip side is that healing in BGs or world PvP is amazingly useful and turns the tide most of the time. You're not a powerhouse by yourself, but big battles are hard to win without heals.
---
I’d say pre raid bis before epic mount. You’ll be getting some gold by farming for pre raid bis in dungeons. But if you’re guild is geared and you’re not, who’s probably going to that first guild MC run?
---
Read the comments homie! It still generates threat regardless :D
---
&gt; -We still believe retail is in a dire place right now. It could get better and many of us will probably play it with vanilla at the same time.
---
Retail is absolute garbage infested trash
---
&gt; -We still are in favor of as few changes as possible to WoW Classic. We're getting something close to what we've been playing on most decent private servers.
---
Absolutely no changes
---
&gt; -We still have a general optimistic yet cynical outlook. We don't eat everything Blizzard PR spoon-feeds us.
---
True true
---
to be fair people expect mages to use a spell just to save them money, and for shamans to spend money just to sabe them time after a wipe. It's just the mechanics of the game.
---
I don't think it was the bs spam man.  Whoever was standing closest to a twin after teleport got a huge chunk of threat.  Plus you weren't dpsing the caster so... really, how much threat was needed?  Just to stay ahead of healers.  If your guild had geared up a couple of locks you could've put in some dps on veklor to speed it up.
---
Somebody made a post on this subreddit last year showing that the mathematical halfway point is a few bars into level 43.
---
Vanilla is far more simpler mechanically speaking. It’s a different experience I been looking forward to this since I saw first opening of AQ. Being a wrath baby can’t wait for the journey.
---
That is quite true. I usually paid mages to get some food in my belly as I was leveling.  
---
But yeah Class identity does come with perks but also with responsibilities!
---
Thank you for your answer. Btw, was it you that made the giant Jaraxxus pop up in org back in bc/wrath?
---
I was always Horde, but Shadowmeld is by far the best thing if you have kids or just need to frequently “pause” the game
---
A man who has his priorities straight.
---
Rogue here.
---
Back in the day there were actually very very few warriors who knew how to deal with rogues. 
---
Watch Laintime I think it was the name of the warrior. 
---
Basically what he does is stance dancing and not allowing players in his kite zone.  The major challenge will be actually to get good gear because you are much much more gear dependent than a rogue. A good rogue can keep you stun locked, kite you and kill you naked.
---
Once you get the gear, you will be able to survive stun locks and cc, also get a good shield and learn how to stance dance.
---
Engineering is a must a profession.
---
It will still be somewhat difficult at the beginning but it takes practice.
---
Go orc as a warrior if you play horde with the 25% stun resist, or dwarf, but at the end of the day pick a race you like.
---
yep. there's a # of people "in the know" saying that it won't work in classic though
---
Amen! Great advide; if I do level a warrior again I will add this to my habits. Always had great Tanking runs through every dungeon but this sounds like it would make me a pro.
---
If you're not the MT, yes. It was also a joke.
---
Well that's good because orcs are even more annoying than dwarfs.
---
FOR THE ALLIANCE!
---
Acksuwally, should flip the image...classic is going to save retail
---
I have 4 days 7 hours currently /played on a private server and I am level 44.
---
I am a priest and most of the time I have rested Xp. I would say 90% of the time. I was AFK for maybe 4 hours and did not any proffesion. I ran a lot of instances but I wouldnt say I did much unnesseceray stuff. Sure from a speed run perspective I would have wasted much time but I think I did a quite normal leveling pace, just doing quests and instances a lot but for me thats where the fun is.
---
So I expect for the normal player to get to 60 in something between 12-15 days. 
---
I think leveling time is HUGELY underestimated. Sure people here who plan it can do it much quicker, but less than 10 days will not happen for anybody who actually wants to level quick. 10 days is the minimum for normal people. 3-4 days is possible and people will of course accomplish it but if you just play the game and dont plan ahead 10+ days is the very least in my opinion.
---
Just about any new laptop you can buy right now will run the game amazingly. This game is 15 years old, it is absolutely ancient, my smartphone is far better than the computer I used to first run the game.
---
That's what most/ a lot of people did.
---
Us Europeans that didn't have native language versions (French, German) had to learn it the hard way!
---
I will see you on the field of honor.
---
The Devil went down to Sentinel Hill, he was looking for a soulstone to steal...

Trained at: 30

Mana Cost: 10% of base
---
Stand by the Light: The paladin is touched by the light for 60 seconds, reducing all incoming damage by 50% but also reducing movement speed by 15% and attack speed by 50%.
---
Fitting username.
---
Fast, and never worry about socks.
---
Joama you fucking legend. I used your leveling guide a thousand times. Just wanted to say that!
---
If you do instances, elite quests, professions and pvp 10 days is normal pace for sure.
---
Quickness is so hilariously bad, love it :D
---
Yeah I am planning on going Engineering as it is one if not the greatest profession. Also I leveled Orc Warrior all these times; just a great Race. I read on the subreddit that people aren't sure about where or how to 25% stun resist increase applies. Regardless; if it does make a difference fuck it let's go.
---
If I end up going rogue (I am still choosing between Warrior, warlock, rogue) would you recommend Orc or Undead? The Rogue pvp trinket doesn't remove stuns but does remove Fear/Charm/Poly so is wotf that much worth it?
---
Thanks again!
---
for dungeon drops you just gotta plan ahead and do dungeons early. then just buy the BoEs in the AH
---
I managed to get to level 10 in like 6 hours on a Warrior. Granted, it was on a Tauren, and there was a lot of walking, so I guess your initial 1-10 rush results will vary. I think the Hunter 1-10 would be longer, because Warriors output more melee DPS on average, and aren't dependent on range to be able to deal damage.
---
Back in ‘05 my 16 year old self took 19 days in game to hit 60.
---
Yeah I feel studid not realising after play pservers for so long. I hear the best alliance tanks are night elves because of that? Weird really.
---
There are a handful of fights where the tanks are required to wear resistance sets, and only a few fights where the raid is actually required to wear resist.
---
For the vast, vast majority of boss fights the raid is not required to wear resistance gear.
---
Your level 50's will be amazing. You can start farming all sorts of things you'll need after you hit 60, except you get to earn experience while you do this too instead of doing this after you already hit level 60 and only doing it for the loot/reputation.
---
Yup! It would probably make me quit the game after a while even if toggleable. I can't even stand the idea of someone looking at my character on his screen with updated models, that's how much I hate them. So ridiculously stupid looking.
---
The general skill level of the people you will be playing against is slightly higher than it was when drakedogg was spamming people with shadowbolts. It's hard to find that space in a bg as a caster because people now know what a risk you freecasting can be.
---
to have fun is priority dont let you influence from speedrunners.
---
maybe there rush mc but a good prepared player with skill and gold will have a speed boost in midgame.
---
This would be so cool. So while you’re running across a zone, your pet could keep up with you while scavenging nearby?
---
That would be really interesting to see the times for. Each level would be a deliberate push and you'd have to log for a while each time you crossed paths with an inn. Sounds great!
---
* Demo Shout takes rogues out of stealth. 
---
* Rogues want to keep you stunned, so trinket out. 
---
* As soon as you can, rend to prevent them from stealthing. 
---
* If you can, swap to Skull of Impending Doom to prevent gouge and cancel out crippling poison. 
---
* Stay in Battle Stance so you can overpower. 
---
* If you’re ~5 yards away, back out, swap to Berserker Stance and intercept for a 3 sec stun.
---
100% player choice is of course not \*always\* positive - this however, something that only affects how it looks for the person playing, should not really be a big deal
---
The Outlands were over way too quickly. It felt like we teleported to 70 and everything was just a blur. Also, quests all gave amazing loot and kind of cheapened the leveling experience even more. You really couldn't struggle with the leveling process.
---
Well Seymour I made it, despite your attunement.
---
Play what u want, god dammit
---
Don't think retail guys will come massively
---
I think they were joking... I mean hope they were joking, lol. NE is the least good Alliance tank. Dwarf is the best tank.
---
Step on lego.
---
Just being able to ress/eat/shadowmeld is pretty handy while levelling. Perception is the only pvp thing humans get and it's not super useful outside of dueling. If you want to be a pvp beast obviously dwarf or gnome is stronger than either.  
---
PvE wise humans are great for raiding with wep skill, but it makes very little difference levelling. Nelf 1% dodge is really nothing so I'd say either way makes no difference if you want to ignore raiding.
---
Put in that "Big enough"   "Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!" song or no sub.
---
+sword skill is crazy powerful, mostly for dps warriors but it's quite good for the extra threat as a tank too. I generally don't think min/maxing racials is *that* important, but sword skill is so good it's really hard to justify passing it up.
---
Tank God!  
---
see what I did there? im about to delete the post thanks for the answer :')
---
If you know the area and quests well between 2 and 3 hours is a very achievable time for lvl 10. No-pet hunter is one of the fastest classes 1-10 as long as you know basic auto shot kiting.
---
Metrics and quality of interaction with player were both kept track of.  The methods changed through out my time there and in general it adapted to the challenges we faced at the time.  There was quota in place, but I would describe it more of a sliding scale. 
---
If you were really lagging behind, they would let you know and give you a chance to work it out.  Same thing if your interactions were up to standard, they would give you a chance to work it out.  Fortunately for me I never crossed into a zone where I was worried about either, as it wasn't to difficult as long as you stayed productive.
---
Wotf is one of the best pvp racials.
---
General rule of thumb is if you do pve then orc and troll are superior, but for pvp undead has the upper hand because of Wotf and cannibalize.
---
But still, pick a race you enjoy most.
---
Personally I had no idea about racials and stuff like that back in the day, I chose undead because it looked cool to me and since then I never played a rogue other than undead and Wotf saved my life thousands of times.
---
Can definitely relate... from recollection, that's about the time when the Tanaris bonanza runs out after the sugar rush of getting your 31-point talent. Felt like something of a growing up experience for me. No more happy-go-lucky stumbling onto things, time to get serious about looking for quests and doing dungeons.
---
Yeah and I had 22 days till 60. That's why I say people are understating what the average person will take. 
---
Sure this super short level times will happen and some people do it. People here will be quicker than people who are not prepared. But people who like me really like the leveling experience and doing dungeons on the side will need 10 days at  the very least. And there will be many people like that.
---
These are neat! thank you so much for your efforts
---
Whoah!  I do kinda wonder what that would be like, with so many different languages all spoken in the same building.  I would love to know how they broke up that space and who was where!  We had a few bilingual people who could help solve certain language tickets, or help with ToS violations in another language, but not like how it seems to be set up in Europe!  kinda cool!
---
I'd say under normal circumstances, yes, but not on launch day. The zones will be too contested to hit that timing as a casual player
---
from looking at the preview it looks like its gonna be pretty much the same as this https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-1-60-alliance-leveling-guide/
---
I'd still recommend running holy for recruitment purposes that benefit both him and his son.
---
Don't forget Oceania/Australia!
---
Fucking casuals

I agree. What was great about Vanilla (and much of TBC) was that you \*needed\* other people to play, so the game forced you to interact.
---
  Yeah I want to tank or raid, so I guess Human is what I will go, just shadow melding to drop target then charge out, or shadowmeld to roll a blunt sounds legit af.. haha!
---
Why not? Tanks are gonna be pretty rare ye know
---
Where the hell do you learn this kind of things? That's pretty interesting to know but must be a pain to theorycraft it
---
Having a weapon swap macro is important in vanilla. Turtle with a sword/shield then when you get a chance move out of the deadzone, swap to a 2h, hamstring, rend and try land a overpower. When the rogue tries to kite swap back to shield, if he restealths go def stance and turtle up. Demo shout removes stealth it they’re close.
---
A good rogue will bleed a warrior to death, but it’s not impossible to win.
---
I spent about 45 minutes farming the traps while leveling a warrior through Desolace. There were lots of the underwater air vents, so it wasn't difficult, even without water breathing.
---
I’m a dude. Any woman that pulled some dumbass ultimatum would be out the door. You’re an adult. Act like it.
---
Yeah I mained undead rogue for years when first started in wotlk. Now that I've grown older and am a fan of lore and rp elements, I feel like sitting down to eat and drink/sleep and do all kinds of emotes loses its touch when being a living corpse. Maybe also the fact that all rogues are male undead rogues on horde side. I guess we'll see. If wotf is THAT good compared to the stun resist of orcs even though the pvp trinket does not remove stuns I guess I'll see. Oh for warlocks too! Warlocks get whooped by stuns, orc warlock would be dope no? Same logic applies? :(
---
 I couldnt agree with you more. I know it sounds cliche but in my mind the best part is server community, seeing the same people and grouping with them where if you are an asshole people wont play with you. I think having everyone in that starting areas would be super fun.
---
Huh, fair enough, forgot that being able to open with a gun was an option. I've always been a druid main, so I almost never play hunter and I'm kinda blind to it lol
---
The sad thing is - Pallies are SUPPOSED to be able to tank. Hell, even Shamans are set up to tank, they just can’t.
---
Yea i was abit bummed it was not for the beta tbh. Was looking forward to the beta within the month. Its going to be a long summer.
---
If it's just a toggle then you don't have to see it. Simply don't toggle them on.
---
I do indeed 🤣🤣🤣
---
I have 2 kids. (2 and 5) I'm in the same boat. Play when kids are napping/overnight sleep and after I've spent some time with the wife.
---
I honestly don't care, I'll play whereever my friends want to go :p
---
@yourEdit: In vanilla all classes have different effects on their pvp trinket; for instance rogues' pvp trinket removes fear/charm/polymorph effects.  
---
Warlocks' pvp trinket removes exactly those 3 effects too.   
---
Unlike retail wow the pvp trinkets do not remove every debuff that might CC you.
---
Man, I remember purchasing your guide all those years ago. Your videos with Pure Pwnage in the background. Classic.
---
Yea im still going to stick to my guns here and say end of August for Classic. Thats nearly 5 months away
---
Reminds me of fighting for ore on RuneScape back in the day.
---
Yeah that is what I saw from all these pvp videos I've watched over the years. I'm thinking about investing points in Fury into increased range of demo shout. Might be worth it.
---
If vanilla has taught me anything it's that only warriors tank
---
I just did straight-uo 200mg caffeine pills.  Monster makes you fat.
---
spent my gaming life thinking Joana is female until now
---
Haha yes! 99%+ of the time PvP is just normal PvP, but there are some players who go in with a vendetta.  They stole a mining node or ganked them once and won't let it go.  Whatever the case may be, circumventing game mechanics to harass someone wasn't considered PvP.
---
What are you talking about? How is this gambling?
---
felhunter and succubus are used for different opponents. against anyone that casts, you usually prefer the felhunter. against melee and hunters, succubus or void is preferred. in group pvp, you will want felhunter in almost all circumstances.
---
a decent rule of thumb for nightfall is just under 1 proc per minute on average, per corruption applied (for cases where you dot multiple mobs).
---
It's honestly an amazing Hunter weapon but if you took it from a Warrior you'd be a monster.
---
Yeah pretty much.
---
I have friends that still work there, but I am not sure any are still GMs.  Most of them have moved to other areas of the company in line with their talents.
---
I wish I knew about the servers too!  Unfortunately I have no inside info on anything regarding Classic. :(
---
Gonna enjoy tanking alot of dungeons while leveling just  taking it slow.
---
Gonna lvl cooking and fishing this time around aswell for free food on my warrior.
---
Just gonna smell the flowers and enjoy every moment not rushing for xp/min. but still trying to minmax ressources and play well. 
---
Gonna make it a journey, and im ready for a long and memorable one.
---
Warlock are very gear dependent too. But once you gear them you will be able to one shot rogues with seduce/soul fire if it crits. You also have sacrifice which gives you shield, you can spam fear, you have health stones and so on. But still an equally geared rogue with cold blood and prep will open you like can.
---
The game is rock, paper, scissors. Some classes prey on other and vice versa. Just don’t pick a class simply because you want to beat rogues because chances are there will always be some other class that might give you a hard time.
---
The community was always welcoming and more than willing to help newbies. I have fond memories as a fresh player asking the geared high levels for help and they would take time out of their day to walk me long distances to a quest location, and even help me clear out elites.
---
I met many people in towns this way and we'd stay together for a few hours walking around, and they didn't benefit anything from it besides knowing they helped someone out. These people would later become my best friends on the game. I hope I get to experience that awesome cool community again.
---
Alright, thanks. As a warrior that is planning on tanking while leveling I hope I do an ok job :)
---
Me rn, but im still thinking if i should go pala, warrior, rogue, priest or warlock
---
But... I don’t wanna play a hunter. Lol jk I actually am going to speed level a mage.
---
I’m all about vanilla, and that’s what I’ll be playing.  But it’d be delusional to think classic wow will have any significant impact on retail.  People will be leaving classic in droves after the first couple weeks.
---
Not a huge fan of warmode, IMO it's more of a gank-fest than anything since STV.  I think warmode is just a more natural progression of the technology and vision Blizzard had than an excuse for people who are "stuck" on a PVP server.
---
Checked the guy, my theory failed. Maybe something else to it but idk what it is
---
That’s why you put your OWN focus on the healer, then.  ;)
---
I'm looking for people like you who want to experience the community in its full fledged glory together. People who value the game and want to devote themselves to it. I don't know anybody on Blizzard or have any friends to play with. 
---
If anybody would want to add me and experience Classic together I'd really appreciate it. It will still be fun alone, but having a group will make it so much more enjoyable.
---
i love you for this
---
Uh no not really, you have to plan sure but its not hard and Itz from below doesn't know much either.
---
Some of the best gear is Quest gear from long chains, it can be the most annoying, but since you can complete any chain if you can get the first quest in the chain some seriously good gear is available if you put in the time and research.
---
Dungeon drops are easy, get someone or multiple someones (depending on bracket) to farm for you, once they clear to the boss enter dungeon and run to boss or rare spawn and die, they kill boss and rez you then you loot, no EXP earned.
---
The quests can be annoying, but even in late BC with all the faster leveling even 29s who had some serious chains to do could get almost every BIS item, even the offspec and off class ones without leveling. The same strat applies, get help, die let him do the quest and then rez, you only get the turn in and explore EXP (you can get the explore stuff done early)
---
Ah right, yes, been almost 15 years since vanilla, forgot about that, never touched a pserver to see if it’s the same.
---
Maybe I dont remember right, but I thought in old school trade skills gave no xp.  That was like something added in Wrath.
---
Thanks for all of the wonderful comments guys, it was great reading about what you hope to experience in Classic. All I want to know now is, who will your first characters be?
---
If anybody would want to add me and experience Classic together I'd really appreciate it. I don't know anybody currently who would want to play with me. Having a group to relive my childhood again with will make Classic so much more enjoyable.
---
In duels against a great equally geared rogue that has all their cooldowns you will lose. That's just how rogues work in vanilla. Cash them outside without cooldowns and howdowda you kill them so easy. They have cooldowns up? Best run for your life.
---
Haha no!  That wasn't me!  I didn't do to much spawning of stuff, other than when I was a specialist I restored a lot of items and a couple of times I re-spawned bugged quest mobs I had to destroy, but generally we would just let them re-spawn themselves.
---
I was thinking of that, too, but I can’t remember if there’s a pretty decent FP to provide access, unless they added that later. Memories a little foggy on that one.
---
Head on over to EXPoff, plenty of people getting ready over there for classic, might have to hit up some of them in private chat, a lot of the real planning is on real id and steam anymore
---
60-70 was about 40 hours /played on your second character (knowing most of the quests already) if you played at a normal pace imo. The quest hubs were really well made in BC, there were way less ultra grindy quests like there are in Vanilla, and the overall leveling experience in Outland was much smoother. You could level very fast 1-2 levels in Zangarmarsh if I remember correcly because of the abundance of easy quests, but 4 hours per level was a reasonable average. It was by no means super slow, but it wasn't much shorter than Vanilla 50-60 either. 
---
If you PvPed, explored, dungeonned extensively, spent some time roaming around because of how beautiful and impressive Outland was when it launched, you could make it 80+ hours easily, so it was most definitely good quality and rich content. BC had great questlines, it should really be said.
---
I’m hesitant to play classic when it releases because of how long the grind to 60 is.
---
What algorithms are you talking about?
---
I do remember reading that they glued together the old UI lua with the new UI api, and I'm sure they'll have to port scripted events, but nothing about algorithms.
---
I mean, with all of its flaws, I don’t see how you can legitimately play vanilla as anything BUT casual... 
---
(that oughta get ‘em fired up)
---
Feels good
---
That one suxks
---
I think after the blizzcon and all these updates in the last couple months you should get an idea of how they think toward classic.  They are trying to get the correct color for the street lamps for Christ sake.
---
And I would be disgusted knowing there are people using the old shit models
---
Still happy, installed WoW again... oh god what have I done!
---
It's Just Not That Serious
---
Definitely!, I distinctly remember an occasion of running random lowbies who has whispered me looking for help through  uldaman. They were new to the game and didn’t know much about their classes so I was able to give them advice. 
---
Unfortunately I didn’t keep in contact but I know they appreciated it and I’d like to think that it enriched their experience with the game.
---
The one sucks
---
What are your favorite memories from your time as Game Master? Are there any funny stories you'd like to share? What did it teach you about the community? And finally do you miss it?
---
Glad to see you still doing it. I loved your guides back in the day. Keep up the good work.
---
looks like classic mode or more-plants-and-different-water mode
---
It's gonna be Classic. Gotta try something new mate
---
Classic
---
Well, hopefully we end up on the same server!, 
---
Phase 2 will be mighty craic!
---
Word.
---
He's asking which one is better. Answer his question or don't bother replying.
---
Night Elf for tanking isn't *that* much worse than Human, OP. As you said, 1% dodge is nice to have. Humans pull ahead a lot in threat, though. And threat is the single biggest limiting factor in raid DPS. It won't be a huge deal whichever one you choose. :D
---
You have gm joke ?
---
So glad I'm not alone in that. The difference is... underwhelming.
---
77F is hot? Good lord.
---
Just be sure to have the talent that gives health when stunned. I can’t remember the name but it’s a massive boost against rogues, especially if they’re trying to poke you through a shield while you regen health.
---
Yeah youre totally right.  
---
You've been bullying me since level 20! HOWBOWDA!
---
**tl;dr: nobody knows for sure right now**
---
likely, most of the addons for retail won't work in classic. however, since the client is based on 8.0, most addons should be easily portable to classic. for mods with active development, these will be ported during the beta so that's when you can start planning your UI.
---
Those kinds of experiences bring a tear to my eye, we didn't know then that the close knitted community would fade away. 
---
The game then was truly special. I like to believe people will try to relive the soul of vanilla to bring it as close as possible to what it once was. I'm so excited, not much longer now!
---
I'm willing to bet that most server first 60s are going to be in the first two-ish days of the server being up lol and with 50+ people helping a streamer/big guild lead/whatever to get it.
---
Retail before classic should be the bottom pic and retail after classic should be a pile of ash
---
which is totally fine. classic should look classic, and i think the "ultra" settings don't make it look any less classic.
---
What if no changes though
---
Saddly that doesn't exist in vanilla; there's the talent that heals x% of your health after being victim of a critical hit.
---
Depends if its gonna be cross server bgs or not.
---
Gonna raid as Ret, fuck dps meters. As far as I know, I’ll be tops deeps and taking all the 2h weapons
---
Do you have a link to a better one? Im trying to find a good alliance guide before release.
---
I leveled a mage for the first time, took me 12 days playtime (290 hrs)
---
I had back then (2007) a very strange case. My brother was playing on a friends account and was boosting some poeple in Deadmines. 
---
He lockpicked a door and one of the guys got angry he couldn't shoot it with a cannon and said he is going to regret this.
---
A few days later we couldn't log in that account but we thought maybe our friend changed the password.
---
Fast forward a few weeks (to 2007 ‎June ‎17 to be specific), playing on his account someone just whispered us that he has this character. We were like WTF you talking about and he whispered us the account name and user combo for our friends account, claiming his friends did hacked it. I logged onto it and every item was sold from all characters and all money removed. I immediately contacted the GMs to lock the account and restore whatever they can.
---
But only our normal account got banned for 1 month due to account scamming (which I guess was technically right, as officially you are not allowed to play on your friend's account). 
---
Did you ever encounter such a case where someone could hack up someones account in a targeted way and later on locate even other accounts that were used on that computer? It's still puzzling me how he could do it, although I don't know how much did addons allow to see from the other side for instance, if you could get the other players IP that way or something like that.
---
He's telling him to play whatever he wants, as it seems like he really wants to play a Night Elf, but feels as if he will be missing out on the Human racials. 
---
So, you just flamed that guy for telling OP to stick with Nelf.
---
For the love of God, do not use Thunderclap while tanking. Heroic Strike should not be used unless you have a highly excessive amount of rage. Between Sunder Armor, Revenge, and Demoralizing Shout you should rarely be in that situation in a five man. What you said about macros and CC is on point.
---
I dont play retail I just meant my addons that I use on vanilla p servers but I guess your answer still stands either way. Thanks!
---
I'm definitely going to be looking for a parent's guild! I have an optimistic feeling that there will be a significant fraction of the player base that will be of the "play when the kids and SO are asleep / occupied" variety.
---
&gt;  forgot that being able to open with a gun was an option
---
I had forgotten about that! The Zelda quest will be back in the game so paladins will be able to ranged pull with Link's boomerang! So many memories
---
That's why the sugar free option exists.
---
vanilla p server addons *definitely* won't work in classic.
---
Except they weren't unclear...at all, not even in the slightest...
---
are those video cards really budget
---
Why not both?
---
I don't see how shitting on a laptop helps but it's your money so no judgements
---
He gave him zero useful information. I gave him a couple sentence run down of the advantages and disadvantages of Night Elf versus Human. I take it OP actually wanted actual advice instead of blind reassurance.
---
Awesome, sounds like you have a plan similar to mine. I'm in it for the long haul too. For me it's all about the journey, not the finish. Leveling and interacting with people I encounter and hopefully making friends along the way was always the best part. 
---
Would you want to add a returning veteran by any chance? I don't know anybody to play with. 😢 It would be pretty great to have people to savor Classic with.
---
I'm more than okay with this. Entirely client-side. I want classic gameplay not classic visuals which were the product of historic limitations.
---
Out of wanting to relive memories, I'm probably going either Human Alliance or Dwarf. However, instead of being a Paladin I'm considering a warrior. Reason being, warriors with explosives in pvp is scary fun. 
---
As far as territories go, the human zone was my first and it would be charming. I love the forested areas immensely, however those mountain areas as a dwarf are seriously inspiring and to be Frank a bit more mysterious. The town near Loch Modan holds some fantastic memories for sure.
---
You can't go wrong. The game will be harder again, and I'm excited, even though I cant devote even 1/10 the time I once did, do to no longer being a shut in. Hah!
---
Oh yes, my mistake. Blood craze. Second wind was a tbc talent. Ignore me!
---
It's crazy to see you coming back.  
---
Back in the early days of Overwatch I checked out your stream and asked if you'd return to speedrunning Classic if Blizzard ever released Classic Servers, and I remember you responding that you didn't believe that Blizzard would ever do something like that.
---
How did you feel when you heard about the announcement? It's kinda crazy thinking back how most of us didn't really expect something like this to ever come true in the near future.
---
Or if you run out In the open world, just log for like a year and get 2 bars.
---
Are you me?
---
Are these spoilers? I'm near the end of the first book
---
Yeah they did, myspace, limewire, Webkinz, and club penguin!
---
So true.
---
I got that one too, and I love it.  Plus, it doesn't look like a gamerboi red accented monstrosity.
---
What’s that you say, my sweet little potato? 10fps? Don’t mind if I do, my little strugglebus.
---
You can't hit 60 in even 3 days of play time on launch
---
So hyped!!
---
I was so taken aback when I tried leveling a warlock for the first time. It’s like constant chain pulling 2-3 mobs, it’s so satisfying. Especially after playing a mid-50s feral Druid, it was night and day.
---
I love vanilla but burning crusades class design because of stuff like this.  More classes were viable in raids and PvP in burning crusade.
---
This was also the era of Bawls a soda/energy drink marketed towards gamers. We used to go to a lan center from like 2002-2005 and were always psyched when they had Bawls in stock. 7/11 carried it for awhile too. Tasted like Sprite and Skittles. Had a blue bumpy bottle.
---
Most people get 60 in max of three days on private servers.
---
For laptop gaming yes. You pay extra for that.
---
What a lack of consideration from his guild then :P
---
my god I wish Second wind was in!
---
Great to see you back at it man!
---
I gotta ask, did you ever see wow being a part of your life again and how pumped are you for classic?
---
Not trying to nitpick. But wouldn’t people be incentivized to take the full 3 weeks? It might net them an extra level or two in rested. Perhaps it’s too demanding to ask people to record and not log off in an inn though.
---
If you want the best race in this case, human for sure.
---
Would recommend Skarm’s videos for tanking as well. You won’t equip a shield 100% of the time even as a tank if you are good and that extra weapon skill while dual wielding is legit.
---
Pshhhh that money from leveling is going straight in the devilsaur bin so I can get a raidspot on my overplayed class.
---
It is a hunter weapon tho.
---
I honestly don't know. There isn't much of a difference from what I can see, so I might as well just pick the classic mode and trigger as much of my nostalgia as I can.
---
Yes this will happen, even if pop on a server is not huge.
---
classic-_like_ graphics but obviously it's still using the Legion renderer, just with lower settings.
---
That said it might actually run better due to performance optimisations to the rendering path since then or better compatibility with newer video cards due to a more recent version of the directx API 
---
¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
I've seen them on here. There is one for 9-5ers that wants to do end game stuff but appears to be not super hardcore that I'm considering. They wanna raid at 7 PM Western Time in US, which would be 9 PM my time. Seems about perfect for me, kids will be in bed for about 2 hours and I'll get some time with the wife before the raids.
---
\*Clicks Random Class\* HOLY SHIT.
---
#3 Usually dots and then wand. Occasionally shadow bolts. Pet on top of that. So yes way more than a priest.
---
...but the girl on girl action...
---
It's called Classic WoW right? Seems like one logical choice to me.
---
do you have 1440p version
---
Not much of a diffs.  Real question is what’s the FPS hit.  If more than 10%, not worth it IMO.
---
I leveled a priest on Pserver, it's literally swd and then wand.. warlock can't be more wanding, can it?
---
&gt; But they should have been.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; If Blizz could have they would have.
---
They didn't even have Guild banks in the LAUNCH of tBC. They weren't added with Black Temple in 2.1. They weren't even added in 2.2 that had a lot of QoL changes. They were added in 2.3 with ZA. That was 11 months after the launch of tBC.
---
Surprised that many people say epic mount. Imo better to gear up first and from dungeons you will get some gold as well. Also easier to farm when you have better gear.
---
Oh, I misread. I understand. It's much funner than priest.
---
How viable is holy spec for leveling?
---
With my shite pc, I don't get a choice
---
Crazy how more than one year  of your life  went into this game. More like two years if you don’t count sleep
---
Since in planning on playing rogue I was going to level herbalism and alchemy to fuel my world pvp and also to make money.
---
Wait I've been told battle is fixed and doesn't get split and demo is fixed and gets split therefore battle is better for many mobs.
---
Improved Shadowform:
---
Whenever you critically hit a target with mind blast you cast fade. This effect lasts 5 seconds.
---
And?
---
Took me nearly half a year to level to 60 on my first character, because I'm a completionist and I wanted to explore each zone thoroughly before moving on to the next one. I'm really hoping to level just as slowly (if not slower) in Classic.
---
I levelled a paladin as prot all the way to 60.  It can be jank at times, but tanking dungeons is fairly easy and very fun.  Just start out as holy spec to get Consecration, and put basically everything else into Prot.  Even tanking 60 dungeons (especially scholo and strat cus of Undead mobs) is 100% viable.  If I play Alliance at any point, I'll have 0 problem inviting a prot pally as a tank for dungeons.  People *do* who have a problem are cowards :P
---
I don't know anything about pally tanking in raiding other than I can't see it being more optimal than Warrior or Druid tanking in any form, sans maybe offtanking lots of mobs?
---
Fine. You trade a little faster kill for better resource management.
---
I love the idea of each class being able to create a joke armor piece just for fun.
---
&gt; kind of pissed that Blizzard still is sitting in the background not really giving us ANY type of information to hold onto about Classic yet. 
---
Ummm....you should check out the Classic forums. Plenty of information has been given.
---
Backstab, SnD, backstabs, evis, feint, repeat.
---
I've mained feral druid since vanilla and I am anticipating a lot of "lol druids can't tank or dps. You should be healer." XD
---
I've tanked through TBC in a server first guild and still managed the learn a lot from this guy.
---
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5xSfo5nMGSmv00sGpRN7SQ
---
He is really progressive and even though some things may not work the same, he knows A LOT about tanking. What I really love is that most of the time he's not trying to be the be all end all, but rather makes you think about your decisions. He's not just giving you a BIS gear list or the perfect talents, but rather explains what certain talents do, how you can perfect your tree for your specific needs, and how you can get the most out of your gear, and what options you have. I really think you should check out his content!
---
Crazy. That would give me the shakes for days.
---
boss fights not rogue rotations lol
---
I dont think thats enough. The closest target gets what? 3-4k threat? Healers have 50% reduced threat on their healing split between both twins and sometimes a bug. That means a 2k heal would do something like 300 threat, and you need to keep healing the tank for 40 seconds while he's getting nuked by 4000 damage shadowbolts with no resistance gear on.
---
Orc is way better for rogue if you want to min/max. Stun resists is too good and while the active racial isin't too much its something. Like you said the trinket removes fear/charm/poly and warriors have ways to get out of fear, along with the fact that against alliance you will run against way more classes that can stun.
---
Agree.
---
I care more about getting [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcJyercsiVQ) than the foliage and water stuff personally. With the darker nights and such
---
Mmf. The one class that I actually like but haven't tried. Same with spriest. That'll be a fun one to decide. Ill keep that in mind, thanks man. 90% hunter main and 50/50 sham vs spriest alt.
---
You're crazy, hell we didn't even have internet back then!
---
Depends on the pre-bis. Time saved using a 100% could lead to gold increases that allow you to buy pre-bis items or farm consumables which might do more for you than an increase in a slot.
---
There's an active group of people on the classic forums(by group I mean like 5 individuals) who want blizzard to actively punish or deny twinking from happening. Which I feel is absurd because they're the same people who defend their specific still of enjoyment in the game and won't take criticism for it.
---
I always saw healing as, instead of you vs the mobs, it’s you vs your group. They will do their best to get themselves killed and it’s your job to prevent that.
---
Confirmed
---
This answer alone makes me feel great because I really want to play orc, and playing rogue will simply be great. Thanks fam. Hey do you know if the 25% increase is flat out +25% chance to resist stun or is it 25% increase to a base % that already is there. Say it's 10% so + 2.5%. any idea?
---
&gt; disappointed to see Perplexity controlling the fights. 
---
That's the match-up, brother. r/classicwow isn't going to have any secrets.
---
I'm on pretty much the same schedule. I can reliably be on for a few hours starting about 9:30pm EST. Did you find that group on the Looking For Group post that gets stickied on this sub weekly?
---
Yep gotta accept what is!
---
That button was available in the Blizzcon demo as well, it changed the graphic settings to be somewhat similar to the retail 1.12 version.
---
This is assuming your playing warr and tanking. I will be bear tanking like a god on my way to 60
---
Play a private server like the rest of us silly
---
Oh god.... Don't remind me of those!
---
Healer here!  Remember to never prehot or hot at the start of pulls. Wait a good while before topping off the tank if you can. Early dungeons you can start a big heal when the tank is at about 50%. 
---
If you are a priest use fade if you get threat!
---
Ayeee! But I think druids have an easier time AoE tanking at lower levels; I might be mistaken tho!

Ok so they didn't use the word algorithm, but they talked about how all of the parts fit together like puzzle pieces. Since you know the puzzle piece video, I won't link it. The way those pieces interact are through algorithms (It takes a piece of information from the client, processes it, and then sends it back to the client. The word for how a server processes client info is algorithm, I believe). Trying to get the Legion client to interact with the 1.12 server code lead to some weird things because the Legion server code uses a different algorithm to process the data sent by the client than in Vanilla, so the Legion client doesn't send the same data that a 1.12 client would and the 1.12 server code tries to process it like it's the 1.12 client. Then the 1.12 server tries to send back it's processed info but the Legion client can't understand the info that the 1.12 server sent because it's not programmed to. It's like when someone tries to speak in broken English. You can get the basic gist of what's being said, but they may use different words or may not know how exactly to fit those words together, so a lot of meaning gets lost or misunderstood and that person may not understand what you mean when you speak as well. What this means is that they can't just take the Legion client and shove it into a 1.12 server. 
---
It goes much deeper than just the UI and scripted events. They have to rework how the client speaks to the 1.12 server so it can interpret it perfectly and then also understand what that server sends back to display it properly.
---
You like rogue, want to be a live person, find the class fun and want a class that has a high skill ceiling in pvp. Seems like an orc rogue to me.
---
60/2=44
---
99/2=92
---
There is no way in hell that old ones will work, its almost entirely different arcitecture.
---
Expect DBM, Big Wigs and Weak Auras to be the most popular and widely used due to how essential they are today.
---
Thanks I hate it. Everybody remember the people who got the black insect mounts and scarab lord title when whatever-it-was-called opened? 
---
Oh except our server had everything crash. The game was unplayable. Then whenever Blizzard would add new servers entire guilds would xfer to them just to go collect all the realm firsts. 
---
In short, while I hope you have fun doing this, it definitely has some negative aspects.
---
Great idea! Glad to see you're around still. Back when I was a kid I used to watch your 1-60 leveling videos over and over or just play them in the background and enjoy the sound of your troll hunter running around and killing mobs :D 
---
P.S.: There's a typo on the webpage:  
---
"Please note that the time when you make your **fourm** post also determines the total IRL timespan it took you to get to 60.  This is important to determine world firsts."
---
I main warrior but know and theoycraft with rogues in guild, can give a lot of info through pms
---
Keep in mind that shadowmeld in combat was not a thing till like cata
---
lol are you getting on my posts to make me go Orc rogue? Either you love orc rogue and want me to bandwagon or you know I'll be an easier prey and want my demise! Oh my I do not know what to think!
---
Isn’t the cloth turn for the AQ war effort?, so won’t be available till the aq phase drops

I was wrong -- says they are shooting from 6-10 PM Pacific time --- so that would be 9 PM for you and 8 PM for me.
---
I said that because I took  J. Allen Brack's word of "you do but you dont".  When I heard him in 2017 announcing classic WoW coming back I was completely shocked and im glad to be back on WoW again :)
---
When you dodge when tanking you are not gaining rage. so it both as good as it is bad.  
---
But going human, you gain more rage with attacks since you hit harder.  
---
But at the end of the day, you should play what you think looks best. Dont let anyone tell you otherwise.
---
One thing nobody has said is setting up binds and macros in the beta client close to launch, and copying the wtf folder over. It should look almost identical to legion, and maybe even bfa in terms of syntax
---
It’ll definitely be a thing for a very small portion of the community
---
Link to where they specifically said that?
---
My guess is they aren't going to talk publicly about their changes until after they have at least been alpha-tested.
---
This opens me up to at least make my alts to get them rested xp.  But scares me with the potential of not hitting 60 in time to raid with friends
---
Oh, that looks like it might be a good fit for me, so I'll check them out. Thanks for pointing me in their direction!
---
+10% rep &gt; 1% dodge imho  
---
Human +weapon skill is okay. But let’s be honest,10%+ rep is pretty amazing by the time you are grinding AQ or Naxx phases. I don’t know anyone that like grinding rep.
---
the real fun is taking your 19 twink to redridge
---
I feel like that’s the thing, a lot of shit IS a hunter weapon, it’s just we should take 2nd, 3rd or even 4th priority to some classes. Lol
---
&gt; #1 - I've seen some people talking about pre launch recruitment for guilds and first week MC runs, where is this recruitment going on?
---
There’s a LFG post on this sub once a week. Pretty sure it’s wednesdays. Also, there are many discord chats for content creators for WoW Classic, they’ll all have a lfg chat. 
---
&gt; #2 - When following a speed leveling guide, is it implied that while following the guide you tag and kill every single mob you see?
---
Log in to a private server and level 3 characters, you’ll quickly find that killing too many things actually slows you down. The truth is, you want to kill mobs for quests, then any time you have full mana/health bars unless you have a long run. During a long run, it’s often better to just run. Certain level ranges are short on quests, mid-30s to late 50s comes to mine, then you want to spend a bit more time grinding between quests.
---
Ive added this in :)
---
Lol 90% of that is just the colors. Neon green/yellow/orange/red on black background.
---
You use Thunderclap to initiate. Wtf else are you going to do with all that rage after you charge?
---
BF+AR with raid gear and an ashkandi..  
---
Yeah, that won't be broken at all.
---
I would love guild banks. No change to gameplay, share guild matts and money publicly with an audit system to see who deposits and withdraws what. Im mostly no changes but considering the alternative leans towards account sharing I’m all for gbanks.
---
Yeah I found them a while back but forgot exactly how I found them. Had to go thru my comments in my profile to find it....its bookmarked now. Something I'm considering. Only have a couple real life friends playing so I'll have to find a decent sized guild to do anything end game and that seems possibly doable.
---
Just work out between now and launch
---
herbalism. i currently have a 28 main with 180g from farming for about 12 hrs this weekend
---
Is that you webpage? I've used the bis list many times in vanilla, so if it is thanks!
---
Demo Shout? Tab Sunder? Battle Shout? Literally any other ability that costs rage?
---
Well seeing as there's a toggle, both.
---
It's small enough not to matter, will probs do max because the lighting is better
---
What's in the members area? Racy screenshots of his characters?
---
I would not even care if they are a Option in the Game. Since they are purely Client-Side, nobody is forced to look at them.
---
The most basic concept of tanking:
---
1. the first thing u need is a shield: your job is to take damage, and take as little as possible. plate (early lvls: mail) armor and stamina helps a lot.
---
2. Sunder Armor and defensive stance. this is your one most basic tanking skill. if you can, use revenge (more rage efficient).
---
3. you're the leader, you decide the pace, the focus targets, etc. (check your healer's mana to not be a moron leader)
---
The aspartame will kill you faster than the diabetes will...
---
Did you make this post after an annoying run? :P
---
Amazing
---
That only applies if the MT is in the DPS group which should never even be the case. Buffs are only party-wide in Vanilla which means the MT BS would over ride itself.
---
Fat sacks
---
Wow noob here. All I know is from reddit and hearthstone. 
---
If I tank on druid can I smack preist with innervate between pulls and then pull like a madman?
---
Are there really as many of these hardcore purists out there as reddit seems to think? I feel like if there's anyone who'd fall into that category it should be me (played day 1 on release of Vanilla through Naxx), but I could care less. I just want to go back to that pre-expac world. It doesn't have to be an exact replica as long as the difficulty level is still the same.
---
it's a good pvp warrior weapon, it's an average pve 2h fury warrior weapon.
---
both Bonereaver's Edge and Untamed Blade are superior. (depends on procrate)
---
If you're leveling a caster you can always get someone to enchant +30SP to a skinning knife. That should last you ALL the way to 60.
---
Don't forget to mark CC/focus targets
---
Do I have unlimited gold or is it a one time thing? Playing a rogue and keeping double crusader on my weapons sounds pretty good.
---
Why use those in Battle Stance when you can use them in D Stance? Can’t even use Sunder in Battle Stance. Get maximum value out of your Battle Stance before swapping to D Stance. How do you get maximum value? Thunderclap.
---
None of my real life friends are going to play classic, so I'll be starting from scratch to find a group. If classic is a social as I remember vanilla being, it shouldn't be a problem to find people.
---
Early AV was the best. You could Level there, make money and even get some Honor.
---
92 is half of 99
---
So does this mean you can level up 8 classes in the time it takes to level 4? Or would it be more like 5 due to one char not gaining full rest at any given time?
---
What do you call a lake full of Resto Druids?
---
A HoT tub!
---
Yeah these advices aren't bad at all! I'd say sunder armor isn't that useful early on but it is when you tank bosses. Good shit sir!
---
It's a thread about druids. Someone stated a fact about them.
---
If they said druids are useless or cant heal that's lying. Saying druids are a weaker class isnt lying or hateful. They are.
---
Iam very excited about Phase 2 also!!  I had a blast in Pre-BG world PvP originally! ;)
---

---
Hahaha no no :P I haven't played a pserver in a while. I try to stay away as long as possible to feel the hype and freshness of Classic on release. But I was thinking to myself that if I end up not playing warrior this time, I will have to be behind a player that could pretty much be a complete noob at it. Hoping I can mitigate the risk in advance for us all :p
---
Yeah that is 100% accurate
---
This: Yessssssssss
---
I love it!
---
Yea, but not a fresh server. Herbs won’t be worth anything on AH at launch.
---
Or get isekaid to another world where there is no classic wow
---
That's not how shadow meld works in vanilla
---
