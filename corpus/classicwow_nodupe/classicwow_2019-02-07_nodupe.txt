....they had a demo you could play at home.
---

---
That beats any video. 
---
---
---
Even better if you do it in a cast iron pan. Sear it on the stove in olive oil then put the whole pan in the oven.
---
Probably, its more likely closer to a 2% proc rate like any other item in the game's proc (and varies depending on weapon speed in 1.12 for proc per minute)
---
I like to keep strafe bound for movement flexibility (and by that, i mean using it to wall jump a lot).
---
I use 1-5, shift 1-5, alt 1-2 for basic rotational skills. 
---
Then I unbind Z, X (at the 'bottom' of wasd) and T, G (to the 'right' of wasd).
---
* Z is the interrupt (on any char that has one)
---
* X is the 5min~10min damage cooldown (on any char that has one)
---
* T is the 5~10min 'oh sh*' defensive cooldown (on any char that has one)
---
* G is the big 'ohhhh shiii*' defensive cooldown (on any char that has one)
---
And I use ~ for random things. like normal ~ is engi trinkets. Alt+~ is mount. etc. 
---
Then I bind random shortcuts to NUM1-6 and use my Naga mouse w/ the side numkey. 
---
As someone with a lot of alts, I find it's pretty useful to keep keys "purposed".
---
So 1-4 (dmg rotation keys) is single target. Shift1-4 is multi target. Alt1-2 are heals (or bandage, pot). etc, etc.
---
Seduce, then Soulfire
---
Lol I did the same! My tiny kodo was my pride and joy. But, soooo much cloth!!
---
[The Lost Supplies](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?quest=1423) was a delivery quest started from a box in Northern Swamp of Sorrows and ended at Nethergarde Keep in Blasted Lands. Yes, it took an unbelievably long time, hardly anyone did it. That's why better ways of grinding reputation were added later in vanilla. 
---
I don’t think it would though, they’re all different games imo, when you consider content, class, profession changes, among all the rest. Everyone has their flavour(s). I preference vanilla over all but maybe I could get into tbc? Doubtful though, I liked it, but not enough to go back.
---
&gt; Lol imagine the delusion to believe this.
---
&gt; TBC and WotLK were more successful.
---
I said 'original' to imply pre-Cata, which admittedly may be a distinction that exists only in my head.
---
I agree with the first point, but don't think that people are thinking this through.
---
Just imagine *four* different versions of WoW out at the same time?
---
Retail, Vanilla, TBC, WotLK...
---
or not at the same time, flying mount TBC/WotLK *replacing* Vanilla? Then we're back where we started with the same issue.
---
Every single pserver I've played on which progressed to TBC with optional transfer has *immediately died* as soon as TBC beta for that server released.
---
The big guilds get fractured, people lose interest in raiding, what few remain are broken and too few.
---
It's a microcosm that has played out over and over again.
---
Vanilla and retail are different enough to not cannibalize each other.
---
TBC *will* kill or at the very least terribly maim Classic.
---
What's the rush, vanilla isn't going anywhere and taking it slower just makes it easier to find dungeon groups later on (along with more appropriately geared people).
---
not in terms of media coverage and marketing - you can't slap a (heavily paywalled) playable demo on a news post, hit publish, and call it a day.
---
Didnt you see the ""?
---
Anyway I have played Vanilla since 2015 and never seen a single guild use dkp. Maybe they exist and will exist in Classic but its very very rare. Have you seen one?
---
It sounds like you want to create your own game man. This does not relate to classic WoW in any way. I suggest finding another subreddit to post this content if you genuinely want to get taken seriously because you’re only going to be seen as a troll here.
---
An undead with a Kodo is definitely one of the rarest race/mount combinations in classic. Imo Kodos are by far the worst and actualyl the only mount Id refuse to use, but good on you
---
&gt;After Naxx I will be leaving vanilla because I will have had my fill.
---
Awesome, mission accomplished. You had your fill of Vanilla.
---
You want a constantly changing, dynamic, content adding WoW? Play retail.
---
Have any of you stopped to think what happens after flying mount laden WotLK releases? What then? Cata next? To keep it going? MoP, BfA? If Vanilla WoW would die on its own then how come WotLK won't die?
---
This is exactly the short sighted "gimme gimme" attitude of the playerbase that killed WoW the first time.
---
Make a nice, healthy whole-wheat Panini! Even a total kitchen newbie can make a nice, delicious, inexpensive dinner that tastes great!
---
What to do: Get some boneless chicken. Everyone assumes breasts but try to get thighs and such to change it up. Grill it in an inside or outside grill.
---
Get the bread you're going to use, drizzle a little olive oil on and also put it on the grill, but not for long. Just until you see some grill marks.
---
Cheese is a must, but that processed nonsense. Get a nice popper jack for a little pizazz.
---
Optional unhealthy stuff: Like bacon? No problem! Want to throw some chips in the sandwich as opposed to the side? THROW IT IN. Once you got the nice, meaty base and cheese on the sandwich, you get to do whatever you want after.
---
Also, you can cook enough for like 3-4 sandwiches at once! Now you have quick and easy raid fuel on the clock, just put it on a hot gridle or microwave 'til done.
---
Save money vs. Hot Pockets, tastes better, and has a little extra health benefit. Enjoy Vanilla (and enjoy some nice dinner too while you're at it)!
---
I'm an old school player and haven't raided much since vanilla. What are most guilds using nowadays instead of DKP?
---
It’s a figure of speech.
---
I’ve played vanilla since 2005. I only use DKP. 
---
Every gnome or human worth a lick of salt chases the Saber mount. Nothing wrong with that either.
---
Vanilla and retail will cannibalize each other. And yea short term classic vanilla might become a "dead server" for a few months/year after TBC is launched however it would inevitably pick back up after people had their fill. You always come back. Hell im back here over 10 years later if that means anything.
---
SDFE &gt; ASDW
---
Move that shit over so your pinky can hit Q, A, and Z without taking your finger off movement keys. Bind those to primary abilities. 
---
Lmao this reply
---
Disagree, keep classic the way it was nothing wrong with how it used to be class/race combo wise. It would also require Blizz to look at tuning with the new combos in mind.
---
Then what about WotLK release? You think the TBC server will stay alive then?
---
I keep a typical keybind layout and rarely, if ever, customize it between characters. The skill layout per class depends on the logical arrangement of abilities over the keybinds.
---
When I enter the game with a noob, I turn on all bars and all bars already have my keybinds account wide. 
---
I have 1-12, Ctrl 1-12, Alt 1-12 (so 36 slots right there I can access right on my mmo mouse). I have all buttons around the WASD mapped to either skills or UI options I use the most (typically doll model, map, bags, quests) including some Shift and Alt versions.
---
Typically Alt functions are for consumables and items, but a tertiary ability may fall on an Alt key (i.e. Fire totem being E, Nova Shift+E and Magma Alt+E or something).
---
An important note is that the vast majority of my skills are custom macros, even the simple ones such as a basic offensive ability may have a line automatically engaging auto-attack and auto targeting an enemy in the middle of my screen (WAY less tabbing). Other macros can be far more advanced depending on class. Shaman just requires minor quality of life tweaks for the most part.
---
The point is to stagger the release every 2 years. If you waited 2 years to play classic/tbc you probably weren't in any rush to play them now anyway. Atleast with a character copy model you would be able to progress through expansions at your own pace.
---
Fantastic information. Thank you so much!
---
Getting a MMO mouse(buttons on the side) is such a delight it really is. It might feel weird to use at first, but you get used to it really quickly and it's very useful
---
&gt; occasionally mispress it, but in reality it never happens.
---
Unless you're special like me. I screw it up constantly. I've just had to accept the fact that I'm too dumb to do it without accidentally using the spell and used alternatives.  
---
Facts!
---
You should read up on common stock vs preferred stock and what common holder can and cant do. They cant demand anything and this whole concept of making the share holders happy is bullshit.
---
It's about efficiency. 3pc T1 makes farming princess super easy/quick and thus worth the gpm it generates.
---
A counter example is DME farm (which is usually what mages/priests/locks do). Just out of curiosity I wanted to see if it was possible using a gorilla + explosive traps + volley/multi. Long story short it ends up being about half the gpm it would be for a mage just due to damage output, so not really worth the effort as a hunter, although the full farm run is easily doable.
---
Thank you for the thorough reply!
---
What spec did you raid as on the shammy?
---
Change will be what kills classic wow, and will harken back the private servers of old, but with correct numerical values. The only positive from changing retail classic is when they destroy it with change, and all the private server players will be able to enjoy accurate numerical values on all the things private server coders got wrong previously.

Unfortunately your post has been removed because it was thought to be low effort.

was it *that* easy? I know that getting exalted with the Darkspear Trolls on my BE pally was like passing a kidney stone.
---
on the other hand, I still consider Swift Orange Raptor to be best looking mount in the game.
---
But why tho? Benefit who?
---
Its a hard choice. One class doesn't exist and one is druid...
---
Watching the video felt like lvl 55-60
---
I still wish tauren were the only race that could ride kodos. I don't even like 'em aesthetically as mounts (the legs are all wrong), I just appreciate consistency in world building because I'm that kind of nerd. If the big races are too heavy to ride mechanostriders, the small races (here meaning "anyone who isn't a tauren) should be too weak to control a kodo.
---
That said, this is an awesome picture.
---
I'm also leaning towards a healer. There's just something really empowering about keeping your mates alive in all kinds of tricky spots!
---
I might have to try and preserve it somehow as its already considerably faded! 
---
I disagree personally, but that will change for everyone with their wow experience. My vanilla experience only had me to around lvl 30 and then I didn’t come back until Wrath. It wrath I loved raiding and had so much fun with that expansion. Cata was even a lot of fun up until raid finder was released. That’s what killed the game imo 
---
What? No. I'm not crying youre crying.
---
Really amazing post. Thank you for sharing your story. The part about the ziggurat was so intense.
---
Also, I'm glad you are still alive.

Progressing through expansions on dead servers knowing that as soon as you click a button to transfer your character from Vanilla to TBC making leveling greens better than Naxx gear sure sounds like a fun and sustainable experience.
---
That was a beautiful read, thank you.  Glad you ended up alive, I can't even imagine something like that looming over my head and still being able to keep my head up.  
---
Um, it's been like ten years so I can't remember exactly but maybe it was my level 60 riding that got me the reputation? 🤷
---
When you kill same player(s) over and over they give less and less honor. I think most people just dont know how to play for win. Only skill and/or comunication helps here 
---
Yeah it was added with ICC I believe, because the ICC heroics were the first time I remember using it.
---
Yep
---
[https://youtu.be/9SbjASLwA34?t=252](https://youtu.be/9SbjASLwA34?t=252) Its a recent clip. You can also watch the full vid its quite intresting.
---
ah yes, I am sure there is enough sample size to confirm this. Afterall, I am sure you have talked with LOADS of those &lt;1% of playerbase who went into Naxx and subsquently hated WotLK.
---
  
---
Note, not hating on you, but I wouldn't listen to those people on Private servers. I guarantee almost all of them did not clear naxx in vanilla, nor knew anyone who did lol.  
---
Think of it on a business plan though. Players will get burned out after a few years and start unsubbing. That’s when they drop the next expansion just to reel people back in to get profits back up. That’s just smart business. 
---
I always say "roll for chest" then do /roll. Winner gets to open the chest. I usually give the green to whoever needs it. 
---
No ty, may seem like an insignificant change but if we accept that change blizzard may keep changing small things and eventually it will get bigger and bigger
---
I'd say alt works, it's just inconvenient enough so you wouldn't use it otherwise.
---
Strange. I’ve seen 90% of the guilds use DKP.
---
Hmmmm I’m calling bs on this lol.
---
Good troll.
---
That’s my personal fav race/mount combo in PvP!
---
How do we really know that Blizzard has all the numbers and codes correct tho? Legit wondering here.
---
They could be lying.
---
They did add it.  It's in the Burning Crusade expansion...
---
Spirit wolves didn't come out until WOTLK
---
Every player wants to win the bg unless they already lost In their mind. It’s the disconnection of what they are doing to achieve this goal. Most don’t know what they are doing to help out the win/prevent it. Most people who que for bgs are casuals. 
---
If you want to win, premade.
---
How do we know that blizzard has all the numbers, codes and formulas correct as it was in 1.12?
---
&gt;I'd much prefer adding onto Classic after Naxx with more 60 content.
---
I think the problem is that high end equipped characters will way to overpowered at some point. Certainly classes with Naxx gear were already able to one shot fresh level 60s. I'm not against adding new raids but they should primarily be there for the challenge and offer sidegrades rather than straight upgrades over naxx gear.
---
You were in WC, trying out Vanilla. Obviously not aware of the etiquette of rolling on a chest. The contents looted are worth like 30s, and not bound to boot! The Shaman insta-leaving is over reacting. A simple moment of the group chilling out and making you aware of the etiquette would have probably worked wonders. 
---
You also left the green item for the Warrior. That's the opposite of ninja looting. That's being a good person given the knowledge you had.
---
The people getting bent out of shape over this need to take a moment and reassess themselves. You were and are fine. The Shaman, Mage, and Hunter need to learn how to relax and treat people as people.
---
My personal dislike comes from how many times I've done it over so many years. No nostalgia if you still play, as it was unchanged over the years. That being said, the dungeon itself is super cool and I love me some robos
---
It was definitely a thing regardless, you are supposed to swap it while moving around for efficiency. Certainly more common on Warriors though, Rogue doesn't take as much damage when grinding due to stuns.
---
Its really normal to ask how a guild handles loot before hand. Try finding a guild that has a way of loot distribution. that fits you. I liked that we had diffrent ways of loot distribution in comparison to the forced personal loot we have now.
---
I have quite a bit of experience having alts as a college student, it can be rough with consumables if you don't have a good method of making gold. Another issue is just raid nights, you'll basically be raiding most evenings which can be rough. Also it's almost impossible for you to do "up to date" content, you'll be stuck in easy older content
---
It's possible for you to do like alt MC runs, alt ZG/ONY/AQ20 runs. You most likely won't be doing BWL and let alone AQ on an alt account.
---
Do the recipe's need to be vegetarian. I am kind of on the polar opposite diet. I exist solely on animal protein. I don't know why but it's the only way I don't end up obese.
---
If you plan to main raid with both, the hardest part is finding guilds that don't have overlapping raid days.  
---
I'd suggest bringing your alt to alt raids. If your guild doesn't feature an alt raid, form a pug raid and slowly establish a vetted group who you invite each week.  
---
So I checked classic wowhead/thottbot. And there is a comment that claims these numbers are correct.
---
"rlyeh on 2006/11/28 (Patch 1.12.1)
---
10 rep per 200 resrouce points normally 10 rep per 150 resrouce points on holiday weekend for AB Getting rep for this BG can be very time consuming and cause you to spew forth curses at opposing premades. Best way to get rep is to set aside a block of time and get in a premade group -- and please, if you are going to do a premade get some kind of voice server (teamspeak, ventrilo etc)."
---
I also farmed the kodo on my undead mage. I thought I would love it, and I ended up not liking it very much lol.  
---
Nothing like rain in Un'goro to provide some ambience for a screenshot.
---
Holy crap carbonara is that easy?!? It's the only way I enjoy pasta fully! Besides tortellini. Thank you
---
No to flying.
---
No to shared capitals.
---
No to same classes.
---
No to watered down classes.
---
No to alliance vs. alliance arena and vice versa.
---
No to everyone having purples.
---
No to all content being about end game.
---
No to making the original capitals and continents irrelevant.
---
No to TBC and no to WotLK.
---
If I can get the raid content from TBC and WotLK with Vanilla WoW design principles, I'm down.
---
Definitely the most important is just letting your guild know and talking about sulfuras with them in advance. There's VERY few people who actually wants to do the grind for the gold, so as long as you talk about it and make it clear how hard it is, you will most likely be in a guild where you are the only person applicable to getting it.
---
You shouldn't start a class guide with class descriptions. You start by identifying the goals and criteria of your subject first and then seeing which class matches those goals.  
---
I have a pretty good method of identifying which class fits, I just don't have it written out in a hypothetical document.  
---
We will be using DKP or SK. They're fairest. 
---
I wish I had screenshots from back then :(
---
Most guilds at least on Pservers are using loot council.
---
Basically officers/CL decide who gets want, usually this is planned ahead in spreadsheets. I would recommend LC to any serious guild, but honestly DKP is so much better on a more casual guild. The problem with DKP is just that it doesn't rly reward the more dedicated players, not talking about showing up for raid, but for doing high DPS etc. 
---
LC has the problems of it being very tedious and difficult to know everyone in the guild, and obviously it's subject to corruption, that's why I wouldn't recommend it in unless if you plan on being one of the best guilds on your server.
---
Buut for some reason more casual or "want to be hardc0re" guilds all copy the best guilds because "it works for them must mean it's the best system"
---
Change things that are only subjectively better (or worse) is an awful idea. There's just no reason to do that. It's unlikely (IMO) to attract a significant amount of extra players to Classic, but *is* a means to alienate fans of Vanilla.
---
Beta testing does not necessarily require everyone to level at x1 rates, or even level at all.
---
Anyway: Reasons to think there's gonna be some sort of beta:
---
1. Blizzard has told big "vanilla streamers" that there will be some sort of testing.
---
2. Blizzard usually betatest shit
---
3. Blizzard partly used the BFA client revamped to vanilla to allow players to detect bugs, as whatever bugs in the game would be "this comes from retail and wasn't removed/changed/fixed for vanilla yet", things like wrong stats, abilities functioning different etc etc.  
---
Sunken Temple. I believe the design and features of Sunken Temple make it one of the most underappreciated dungeons of all time.  
---
* It's non-linear. It provides a sense of misdirection. You feel like you're locked inside of an ancient temple. Why? Because you're locked inside of an ancient temple!  
---
* It has a 'secret' boss that requires hitting statues in a specific order. Very cool dungeon design.  
---
* In addition to being non-linear, you can traverse the dungeon from it's top floor to it's bottom floor by simply jumping down to each floor.  
---
* It has an option boss that requires a quest line to spawn: Avatar of Hakkar.  
---
* It has a wide range of enemy types. Humanoids, dragonkin, and the gross worm beast / fungus things.  
---
* It is the subject of the level 50 class quest for (I believe) every class in the game, and provides great gear from that quest.  
---
* The final boss is one of the most popular boss types from the RPG handbook: It's a dragon!  
---
* And lastly, an epic item can drop from the final boss, which is just a small bonus.  
---
1) Get a slow cooker
---
2) Throw in a jar of your favorite salsa
---
3) Throw in one or two lbs of (non-frozen) chicken breasts and cook on low for 5 hours.
---
Boom. Tender, flavored chicken. I call it "salsa chicken" because it has both salsa and chicken (go figure).
---
It's not fine-dining, but anyone can make it, it's healthy, it's cheap, it's easy, and it tastes basically as good as the salsa you use.
---
It’s quick, cheap ( aside from the bacon or prosciutto) and tasty, but the hardest part is making sure you don’t scramble your egg.
---
they still dont understand 
---
Great story man 👍
---
Hope to bless you as I pass you while questing, or cut you down if you roll horde again. 
---
Stay well friend. 
---
BFA already feels like WoD development wise so we probably will get a new legion.
---
Or Classic will be it.
---
You’re in the wrong sub mate. People are on this sub to discuss Classic WoW, not here to discuss your distorted view of what it should be. I’ve watched your video and you should really consider posting somewhere else if you want to gain any traction at all, otherwise you’re only wasting your time.
---
God, seeing wow commercials back in the day when the game was actually good was amazing.  They were great and funny to.  It's a shame.
---
That was beautiful, man 
---
Then what's your idea? An MMO CAN'T stagnate, content-wise, whether you're doing a classic version of an mmo (like in this), or an ongoing mmo. That's a death sentence.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Maybe something like a sandbox mmo can get away with this, but not something like WoW.
---
Just to clarify, I'm not saying moving on with the rest of the expansions is necessarily the best solution. I'm not sure, and I'm more curious what other people and Blizzard especially have to say.
---
Then what is most popular now? I have not raided with a guild since 2010, and back then we just had the guild leader as master looter and he would call out loot and we would /roll for it. That's how it was in the guilds I joined, but I did hear about DKP and I knew the really hardcore guilds use it. 
---
Take my upvote. I'll take a high effort theorycrafting thread over a low effort meme image. Thanks for your post.
---
We're talking about classic tho :)
---
Slowcooking goes so perfectly with a game like WoW.  You can prepare everything in the morning and then by the time you're famished from your marathon leveling session later in the day, you have an amazing meal ready to eat.
---
I'd be okay with forcing people into Ulduar, since that's the best raid ever, but who would want to go back to the heroics - naxx - toc dumpster fire.
---
Note: Strictly referring to Wrath Naxx, not vanilla Naxx.
---
Guilds use Loot Council and some few will use EPGP (google that). DKP is very inefficent.
---
Point #7 hit close to home with me. I used to play with 2 other friends in WSG and we’d always tell the BG group to “defend mid” which they were most always happy with, then my friends and I would take the enemy flag and once we managed to make it back to mid it was a free run back to base and easy cap!
---
since classic will run of a modern UI:
---
get a good quality "gaming" mouse (Logitech G402 is wonderful, for example), bind you mouseover macros to the side buttons. having mouseover dispel in TBC probably saved my/my team's ass more times than I can count. it's also great for power word: shield, makes it easy to throw it up on your team.
---
aimed AoE spells (blizzard, for example) should also go to side buttons, way more convenient to aim.
---
for target switching, I'd go with the mouse wheel, maybe with a modifier. also, don't forget that you can bind 'capslock' too.
---
use a fuckload of modifiers. for example, I had Shadow Word: Pain on '4' and mind soothe rank 1 on 'shift+4', also known as the "reflect this, motherfucker". another example would be (sorry, TBC) was having '1' as mind blast and 'capslock' as shadow word: death, with 'shift+1' and 'shift+capslock' as the same spells, only this time aimed at the [focus target](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Focus_target) for 2v2 arenas, because instagibbing the guy we weren't training at the time and who though that he was more or less safe... that was some fun shit.
---
oh yeah, and bind something to set focus target (/focus), in 2v1 situations, you'll be very thankful that you did.
---
Vanilla WoW has plenty of sandbox elements.
---
New people are born all the time. As people leave Classic, new people will join.
---
The real issue is intelligently merging servers and creating new ones as or if the need arises.
---
Blizzard already said they'll maintain Classic even if there're only 2 people left playing. It's for posterity.
---
Some people like flying mount TBC, but Vanilla WoW is *the* definite MMO and has a place in gaming history like no other MMO has. It deserves to be maintained.
---
This seems to be your opinion on the story. What did you think about the gameplay of each expansion?
---
They certainly could be lying and I know that they're lying and stretching the truth on some things. *That being said,* I don't think the bit about the 1.12 database is a lie. Can't be certain of course.
---
Come on man, the Greedo scene was stupid in the first place. You got everything you needed to know from the scene where Han walks on Jabba's tail. Cut the Greedo scene entirely.
---
Also cut Jedi Rocks and the bantha walking in front of the camera.
---
Otherwise the Special Editions are good, and definitive.
---
Loot Council will hand out loot in a way that benefit the guild the most and to people who deserve it the most. Not based on some credit-mini-game...
---
That has been the thinking for WoW since the first expansion. That's BfA, and that's what is coming next.
---
Classic is a different beast. It's a piece of history and a monument as much as a game. The devs said it at Blizzard.
---
The playerbase will absolutely dwindle over time, no doubt about it. But it won't die, it will stabilize. As old players leave, new players will join. A new Orc is born every minute.
---
This takes me back...fishing in the lake behind the tavern...fiery enchant on my dagger 
---
it certainly could have been that easy, BEs start with high rep with undercity and they have a lot of questgivers - something which trolls never had, and they aren't exactly fans of their distant descendants.
---
Ironically enough, my mother is the only one I know.
---
Very good point, thank you.
---
I always felt like the Kodo animation could be so much better.
---
Their stride is just way too small for their size/speed. I wanna see those hooves jumping huge! They seem to scoot
---
I get the sense of pride in Classic, but Blizzard is going to do what makes them the most money
---
&gt; they started to push the whole cross realm dungeon finder
---
Dungeon finder was introduced in the middle of Wrath, but wasn't cross realm and you couldn't just queue for them. You had to have walked there on foot and entered normally once and beat both modes. The Cata pre-patch made dungeon finder cross realm. 
---
So many people purposely mis-remembering the way the game was just to push an agenda. Cata broke the game. Not Wrath.
---
Damn buddy.. you should try to get out the house &amp; meet someone! 
---
Wotlk before they started giving raid gear like candy maybe... back in my day you had to earn your gear. 
---
New tier sets with new but different and roughly equitable set bonuses? Maybe add spell haste instead of crit to provide a bit of a mix up? Quite a few sidegrade options. 
---
Or add content that only gives cosmetics or that aides gearing alts that is super hard but then kinda rewarding too. 
---
Good read. It sadly reminded me of where I was when I started playing. 
---
In 2005, I was 18 and diagnosed with a brain tumor. 10% survival rate I was told. Through the chemo and everything else, my only escape was WoW and all my friends I made there. 
---
Later that year, I had a surgery to remove it, and it left me paralyzed on the left side of my body for 6 months. I was stuck in a hospital bed for that entire time. WoW was again my only escape. It gave me something to work towards, and the people I met in it were always super supportive. It's really shitty to click your way to 60, and click your way through MC... but the people I played with were super awesome about everything. 
---
These days, I got kids and a wife, but I honestly am excited to be able to run through everything again and make some new friends as I go.
---
Where have you seen a guild use dkp? Can you link to one right now?
---
Sorry, but I want to have 25-man heroic ICC on farm. That's my endgame goal for Classic.
---
Besides, nobody liked Cata or playing as a Panda.
---
I think I am going for a White Ram on my night elf.  Looking forward to the same excitement and sense of accomplishment.  I will be a giant among Dwarves in the starting zones.  Lol
---
Not entirely true. Good mages will have that high spirit staff (I don't recall the name) with greater spirit enchant on it, macroed to evocation.
---
Since evocation scales off spirit and you can swap weapons in combat, it is absolutely worth it to macro it (better to use outfitter) and get massive benefit. It only takes up one slot. Some mages also swap while drinking (outfitter does this automatically).
---
On my pserver I'm in a high end Naxx progressed raiding guild and I see that the top mages do this.
---
That being said, I don't know any other scenario similar to this. Certainly not rogues switching to spirit gear.
---
Some guides argue that spirit is counterintuitively actually BiS while leveling, but I haven't really ever seen any melee classes implement this strat personally.
---
&gt; TBC will kill or at the very least terribly maim Classic.
---
Classic does not equal vanilla. Classic refers to a design philosophy that Blizzard abandoned with the pre-patch for Cata.
---
If you're so worried about flying mounts and LFG, Blizzard has heard us. If they do a vertical content expansion, they may not include these. Some of the best Wrath pservers have disabled LFG anyway. They've seen that and know how divisive it can be.
---
Show me one guild that use DKP. It would be interesting to see.
---
The quests still lose rep value once you outlevel them, so even if it takes until 60, it's still the cheapest way to get another races mount.
---
There will be a retail server type and a classic server type. One encompasses the whole game, the other encompasses vanilla+BC+Wrath content. There won't be a separate TBC server.
---
A lot of people here seem to not like the kodo. I don't get it! kodo is best mount.
---
I think because it's so damn out of the way. I've only done it once or twice
---
So when TBC comes out, Vanilla will be destroyed, and Wrath will replace TBC?
---
Not only that, LFG wasn't cross-realm at first, either. You were still required to play with people on your server. Making it cross-realm when Cata launched is what broke the game.
---
But fuck that gautlet yo
---
This is why people promote no chnages. So stuff doesnt compound. I upvote u
---
&gt; [Im one of the naxx clearers](https://media.giphy.com/media/EouEzI5bBR8uk/giphy.gif)
---
Cash shop in Classic? Transmogs that transfer to retail?
---
Activision Blizzard already do what makes them the most money. Though sub numbers are down for WoW, people don't understand that retail WoW makes more profit today due to the all the microtransactions and in a smaller part due to cost cutting like less customer servers and cloud based sharded server infrastructure.
---
&gt;I said 'original' to imply pre-Cata  
---
lol  
---
&gt;Also worth noting - 'most successful game in history' was at one stage a verifiable fact  
---
Nope. Pacman, Streetfighter and many others are way more successful.  
---
What do you mean? I just told you I’ve been in probably 5+ guilds all using DKP. Several cleared Naxx. Certain items were reserved for tanks to help progression. It was the primary loot system for all guilds during retail vanilla. 
---
a) silver dragon around portrait = rare spawn
---
b) he doesnt always spawn, although much more common than other rares in dungeons
---
c) your response doesnt make sense at all
---
&gt; I'll take cata (especially early cata) over wrath any day.
---
Until BfA, Cata was the worst expansion. You should be embarrassed for saying you liked it.
---
There is so much loot that both tank and dps need and healers and dps need along with items only good in pvp or both good in pvp and pve that it would be very inefficient to use a credit based loot system in Vanilla.
---
Thats okay.  I know its not proveable.  I did though.  We only killed kt once.  Aftermath on lightnings blade. First American horde guild.
---
Or you could just have single realms for vanilla+TBC+Wrath.
---
I think my immersion just died permanently 
---
&gt; Vanilla will be destroyed
---
You sound absolutely paranoid. Just because TBC existed in the first place, Vanilla wasn't destroyed. Plenty of people still played the content.
---
Great post, I should note that grinding at level 25 should provide you 20-30k exp/hr (depending on the class) so really.. Grinding is just as good, and you're not wasting any time gathering quests/finding a group - On the other hand you miss out on rewards as well as a fun social experience, which is really what classic is all about. But from a speedrunning perspective, grinding would be just as or even more rewarding.
---
I said no one uses DKP. I never said no one used it in vanilla retail. I know guilds used it 12 years ago. What Im saying is that "no one" use it anymore.
---
Leveling greens in Cata outclassed raid epics from Vanilla. People stopped progressing Naxx even before Cata came out, let alone after it. That's one of the reasons so extremely few people actually ever set foot in Naxx, which more could have if TBC weren't around the corner.
---
I stopped playing on private servers last year. Using a DKP system. Cleared naxx. 
---
I'm sorry but why druid?   
---
Druids? Really? Fireball doesn't proc in forms and all they get is the hard stats on it. Blues are literally better &gt;.&lt;
---
&gt; Leveling greens in Cata outclassed raid epics from Vanilla.
---
Well that's because there's a 25 level difference in there. That's how expansions work.
---
&gt;People stopped progressing Naxx even before Cata came out, let alone after it.
---
That's because it was the first raid in the expansion. Of course Ulduar and ICC would outclass it with no reason to continue it in Cata.
---
&gt;That's one of the reasons so extremely few people actually ever set foot in Naxx
---
Dude, there was a summoning stone right there. Even if you couldn't afford a flying mount, you could still get a guild mate to port you there.
---
When the time is right the fresh server ppl will be all over this. The race is on again.
---
What guild was that?
---
Very Cool!
---
I have never heard of the rep per kill thing, and I got exalted in vanilla. Then again, I was the designated farm defender in my premade so I didn't see much action.
---
Vanilla: Got me hooked loved my lock. We all know Vanilla
---
TBC: *SCREAMS IN SHADOWBOLT SPAM 2*
---
I was hoping to have more to do for an expansion. Felt too samey and the lore pissed me off. 
---
Wrath of the Death Knight: the only thing I played more than my lock was my DK. I fell in love with my DK immediately. Also demonology was fun.
---
Cata: I was just bored flat out, didn’t care much for deathwing. Liked flying in old world. Hated the raid gear look. I like cartoony sets. 
---
Cata I quickly dropped. 
---
MoP: I LOVED EVERY SPEC I LEVELED.
---
Rogue swift spam amazing.
---
Cast on move lightning bolt godliked.
---
Cast on move incinerate with no CD CHAOSBOLTS?!?!!?!! Mmmm I still dream of one shots.
---
Demonology metamorphosis tanking HNGGG. 
---
Blood DK was immortal. Didn’t mind talents being gone.
---
Monks were fun too.
---
WoD: THEY FUCKING MURDERED MY CLASS. I wasn’t invited to anything for a while because locks were so shit. Then THEY MURDERED MY PROFESSIONS!
---
And finally, I couldn’t do quests for over a week. 
---
TLDR: RiP Kill Jaidens Cunning. I quit the game when I heard selfies were the next raid tier. 
---
Legion: 
---
Early: Ehhh, shit legionaries sucked.
---
Late: super fun with full artifact and BiS leggos. Demonology has issues but I loved thalkiel.
---
And surrender to madness??? YASSS.
---
BFA: So basically they’ve been culling abilities and making some spec specific to make all specs like their own classes allowing for more in-depth gameplay than shadow bolt right?
---
Well they culled a lot of the best stuff from specs or put them in talents that we got from legion. Keep in mind most of those were crucial to the specs. So most specs aren’t doing that well unless they didn’t really need the artifact ability.
---
As well our abilities and activity were getting higher and higher. Some specs were a machine gun of presses in legion. If I PVPd in demo in BGS my dreadstalker  And imp buttons would break before I died from lifetap spam. I was hitting that shit so fast. But of course they put a bunch of shit on the GCD that shouldn’t be, making specs slower. And with it being really hard to get haste atm only classes like furry feel real fun for most. 
---
Personally enjoying Destro atm, and Frost Mage. Kinda pissed affliction is single target.exe
---
"make all loot personal"  
---
    
---
The amount of jimmies you just rustled is unheard of.
---
One tip that works for me atleast is to unbind all action page keybindings, then change action page 1 and 2 to shift mouse scroll wheel up and down. Then you have a whole secondary bar with the same easy keybindings like 1234qwer etc with very easy access. I usaly use it for first aid, pots, food and drink, active gear/items etc. And while your at it id suggest you change the scroll wheel function to something else, and use the key up and down to zoom.
---
Yeah I hadn't heard of it either but saw it mentioned on 2 sites. IF that's true it's still only useful for premades farming randoms at their base for the few minutes it takes to win with a 5 cap
---
Tank uses DKP just like everyone else. The only thing predetermined would be TF.
---
Try the hot pockets, they’re quite breathtaking. 
---
&gt; In the time it takes to get that group of 5 to do the group quest and then the instance you could have just killed mob and got just as much xp especially in that level range lots of really good spots
---
As a speedleveler, yeah, there are some great grinding spots in this range. I have a spot that's 20-25k xph - but those can only accommodate 2 or 3 grinders. If they're taken, I need options, especially since my current plans have 75% grinding 11-22
---
But speed levelers are prepared. Come launch, I'll start building this Stockade group 3-5 hours in advance with peers I see at similar levels doing similar content.
---
/w hey I plan on doing stockades at 4:00 - 4:30ish server, think you'll be free for an hour?
---
So is each bar in xp worth 5%?
---
I thought it would be so cool too! I vividly remember purchasing the mount, jumping on it, and then being like "damn this isn't actually as cool as I thought" but then riding it ALL. THE. TIME because I wanted people to notice me.  
---
Would be cool if they added sidegrade gear that would benefit the underpowered specs and make them viable with niche stats or set bonuses. I think there’s some room for stat creativity that was never explored and new vanilla content would be a way to open that up without changing the current gear. 
---
Yeah, i've got plenty of planned grinding spots. 75% of my 11-22 experience is grinding, and 25-30 has some GREAT grinding spots. If grinding is 20-30k xp, and I can break up the monotony for an hour for 25,000xp - that's a wash and a legit option, especially if my grind spot's taken.
---
RetroWoW
---
A memory wipe of every player who has ever played it.
---
&gt;That's how expansions work.
---
Indeed. They invalidate previous content.
---
Rep per kill was only in alterac valley and never for wsg or ab.  
---
Doesn’t need to last more than two years though. The whole point is experiencing vanilla again. Not experiencing it again over and over. 
---
My and others' leveling experience should have 0 impact on your immersion. We're just NPCs that try harder.
---
Yeah AV rep is super easy to gain compared to the other reps
---
So you would be ok with the lowest dps who also is a slacker to roll on gear for pvp that the tank needs for raids?
---
&gt; Poopsock.
---
Poopsock.
---
Only if you, yourself, the player, invalidate it on your own. The game doesn't cease to exist. You just elect not to play it.
---
Give us more details about your dreams. We cant get enough.
---
But DAE loot trading will KILL CLASSIC!?!!?!
---
so Main spec &gt; offspec. You cant roll for offspec against main spec. Think thats pretty universal. And a slacker having more dkp to spend than a MT seems unlikely. But yes, they can spend dkp as they see fit. Thats the point of DKP. 
---
you just reminded me, in vanilla we would occasionally get torrential rain ingame
---
Healthy body, healthy mind, epic loot!
---
&gt; Thats the point of DKP.
---
Yeah and thats why no one is using it anymore. Anyway, goodluck in Classic raids. You will need it... lol
---
will they burn my mouth?
---
Pally not enjoyable to level, no fast movement before 40. Also no stealth, but you said it’s not mandatory. Nonetheless feral Druid ticks all your boxes, pally is lacking on a few.
---
Gnomadins, man. GNOMADINS!!!!!!! That int buff. I'd trade even slower leveling without the human ret leveling weapon buff for dat sweet sweet int.
---
Plus I want a bubblegum pigtail gnome in Judgment armor.
---
I agree with you that the chest is the best choice, but Blizzard's tentative release schedule for Classic suggested that battlegrounds would come with the second raid tier along with Blackwing Lair. If they stick with that, the AV rep staff will be obsolete long before it's even in the game.
---
The better alternative is probably [Redemption](https://classicdb.ch/?item=22406) from Stratholme.
---
Just get a friend to fix you up some crystal water and cinnamon buns! Works every time.
---
Edit:
---
I honestly thought this thread would be littered with names of popular cooking recipes from Vanilla. I'm amazed that it actually took off for it's intended purpose.
---
Also, I forgot that literally nobody spent time levelling up cooking as a side profession.
---
This is the true "Classic experience".  Sit down to eat/drink in between pulls and run into the kitchen to grab it.  Sprint back to your seat just as the next pull starts.  Charge in and spam your DPS abilities to your heart's content.  In the middle of your furious button spam you manage to work in a "feed self" action.  It disrupts your GCD but so be it.  
---
Hot Pocket crits you for 9000 fire damage.  You die. 
---
There has alrdy been 1 beta hasn't there? They just found a good way to monetize it through blizzcon which gave them some great exposure. Any further testing will be exclusive to method gaming haha.
---
Cream and mushrooms?
---
Classic will only change the knowledge of private servers a little most of the values that are guessed at ar server side numbers and private servers won't have access to them. Only way is to hope blizzard really make it an good experience further more eaven whit all the changes blizzard have suggested classic will probably be closer to vanilla then any private servers 
---
my plan was to yeah just start out in whatever race zone I wanted the mount for, most likely Mulgore as undead or Night elf as gnome
---
Nice guide, although I don't believe Stoneform cancels bleed effects. Correct me if I'm wrong
---
WOTLK is literal garbage
---
Because of the catchup systems anyone within a week could go from level 1 to ICC clears
---
There is absolutely no way to make WOTLK work in private servers because catchup systems 100% replace all prior rides,  you go Heroics -&gt; ICC Heroics -&gt;ICC done
---
If that’s working for them then great. If they ever need a cash grab guaranteed to get subs they will release more expansion servers 
---
They are working on the cash shop.
---
*smacks forearm and ties off*
---
Oh yeah here we g... wait a minute!
---
Hakkar o crushridge?
---
soon™
---
Hopefully it's news on pokemon go wow for mobile.
---
I’ve actually done this
---
I appreciate Ythisens post. The most a CM can do it reset expectations a bit.
---
We're bound to get more information soon(TM).
---
My thinking is -- the longer the info drought, the better. Bliz *loves* shock announcements. So the longer they go without a water cooler update, the higher probability of another beta. My opinion, at least.
---
1/2 bag mixed frozen vegetables $0.50
---
1/4 onion (chopped) $0.25
---
3 eggs $1.75 
---
-Warm pan over medium heat
---
-Add oil or butter (1tbsp of either has as many calories as two slices of bread, so use just enough to keep shit from sticking)
---
-Sauté onion: add salt now
---
-Add frozen veggies: stir until thawed
---
-Add eggs: add pepper (or other spices)
---
-Scramble till cooked through
---
-Serve
---
Literally every guild I’ve ever been in was dkp with modified loot council. What fucking guild free rolls shit or forces items, how the hell does that speed up progression?
---
I'm spending my sub money on Powerball until classic drops. 
---
"Introducing all the changes soon ..."
---
[removed]
---
This would change the PvE and PvP meta a lot.
---
And what racial would Gnome Priest get? Priests all have unique race-based skills. 
---
And what would the Human Hunter animations look like? They aren't kitted for raptor strike, etc.
---
You... realize we’re going to 2006, with the same loot tables raid sizes and drop chances right....right?
---
You don’t need dkp now because here’s few items to give a fuck about. There will be dkp in Mc and ony. This is for certain. It is the only way for you to operate a 40 man raid.  Did you even play classic?
---
But how long will it take when you lose every game?
---
&gt; GNOMADINS
---
Not even the Light could cleanse such an abomination.
---
Besides, Dire Maul gear invalidates Molten Core's. Are you going to argue against including Dire Maul now?
---
Does Stoneform remove bleed effects like Rend? Thought it only removed diseases and poisons
---
I've done some moderate raiding as spriest in the past and remembered the time investment to be pretty intensive if you want to be at all competitive, but I'm curious if the overall priest investment is bad even for healers. 
---
My job works me 45-60 hours per week so I'm pretty certain I won't have a ton of time to put into raiding. I managed to go through BWL maintaining top 5 DPS with minimal consumables, wondering if that or warrior is a better option than priest. 
---
What is Dankk Budz even? Holy shit stop living in the woods there’s multiple pserver guilds that use DKP, as bad as it is. MHGA also used DKP. 
---
Dankk Budz Collective used loot council and 15/15’d Naxx. 
---
What now?
---
That is easier to do. I'll do that once I am home
---
Naxx was an enjoyable raid during wrath. The heroics weren’t great, but are you seriously advocating just letting people go straight from fresh dinged to ICC on a wrath server? 
---
This sounds super neat.
---
It probably be a single target casted buff last between 10 and 20 seconds and cause the shamans no end of gripe because presumably its not spamable, and they would have to pick people to give it to.
---
Alright that is exactly the thing I am into so you made my decision easier.
---
Yeah, I also used a wheel up/wheel down bind for my stancing and one reason I enjoy Warrior so much is the lack of binds.
---
There are a few macros that are very nice especially for PvP but every class has a shortage of action bar space. if you include PvP macros, some classes would need addons for extra bars.
---
Sulfuras is nothing more than a prestige weapon/status item and you need to invest thousands of gold into getting it and over 10k if your guild isn’t providing the ingots. No reason druids shouldn’t roll on it if they are going to grind the gold. 
---
I'd love to do SFK as Alliance, but it's so rare to see people actually running it.
---
Have perfect attendance and be upfront that you want the eye if it drops. Be prepared to grind anywhere between 2k and 15k gold for your shiny weapon. 
---
The layout is very confusing once you get to Crowd Pummeler, unless you've memorised it.
---
I really like Gnomer though.
---
&gt;to get ahead of the curve
---
I'm triggered.
---
Just so you know, you can do all of this and never see the drop...ever.  In Vanilla, not only did my guild never get one, no one on horde side got one and I don't remember if anyone on the Alliance side got one.  Not trying to be a buzzkill, just being realistic. By all means though, go be the motherfuckin man and put yourself in position to get it if you do win the gear lotto.
---
Guess I was [right](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/anphsb/so_to_everyone_that_is_so_sure_that_there_will_be/efv81yz/) lol
---
Getting the epic mount for the lock was intense as hell! My guildies showed up to help and it felt so good summoning that gorgeous monster.
---
Seems like a terrible system for everyone, because an upgrade for the MT is massively more important to the raid than an upgrade for anyone else.
---
If the main tank does 1% more threat that means twenty-something DPS can all to 1% more DPS. If the main tank takes 1% less damage that means all the healers just got 1% more efficient.
---
If an item is an upgrade for the MT and you give it to anyone else "because DKP" you just gimped the raid, which means more wipes and less loot in the long run for everyone.
---
Dude my troll rogue looked menacing af on the undead horse. So beautiful.
---
Impressive!
---
EPGP is the most fair system I have used and less headaches than loot council. 
---
There were plenty of Dwarf rogues and warriors in both my vanilla retail and private server experiences. 
---
It's not a requirement unless you're some like mega min-maxxer which counts for less than a percent of the players who will play.
---
Lul top meme
---
God help us we're going to lose so many players to starvation. 
---
I think it's cool they got different collision sizes. A kodo shouldn't be able to fit through a door—it's a kodo.
---
You consider this news? 
---
&gt;the small races (here meaning "anyone who isn't a tauren) should be too weak to control a kodo.
---
Humans rode and controlled war elephants thousands of years ago. I think it works just fine that way (small riding big), but humans don't ride dogs or ostriches.
---
This was why I usually went with Nightsaber mounts.  That was a LOT of Morrowgrain I farmed.  
---
As a human who farmed to exalted with all the cities (cuz I wanted kitties on all of my toons), 100% impossible to do even just from questing every zone available when you were 60. I had to run and clear original AV a whole buttload to do this, when you got rep for every faction by turning in side objective quests inside AV. Since we’re not sure which AV were getting, this may not be possible. There were other events in the future that gave all faction rep also, but just quests didn’t do it, even for humans with their racial. 
---
I think it's fine to take a 30 minute break and go cook a full meal. Maybe go for a run while you're at it.
---
On my rogue I like scrollwheel click to be stealth, forward scroll is kick and back is gouge. I find these to be some of the most vital buttons to hit when it matters most and prefer to have it as idiot-proofed as possible. Really hard to mess up a kick unless you don't plan ahead and keep some energy. I have a mouse with some extra buttons which is really helpful. I usually have one of those bound to autoattack which helps me not have to click things as much, and is a big boon for casters too.
---
Why wouldn't you do this after it's released? Or did you mean that you have done it in the past?
---
wotlk? no 
---
maybe better then late tbc but it was teribad still compared to vanila. 
---
No previously
---
How much gold would you estimate it would cost, all said and done?
---
By summer I’ll be finding random veins 
---
The OP is obvious donut puncher
---
It's unfortunate that wowhead might be the standard for vanilla wow. It's probably one of the most greedy, ad-filled sites I have ever been on in my life, with auto-playing videos and requiring massive draw from your CPU. 
---
Change a lot really. When you look at minute details of loot, guessed numbers, rep values, and more. What private servers have off is a lot. Sure they do a good emulation but they really aren’t as close to retail as most would have you believe.
---
Tauren warrior for that sweet tank.
---
Orc shaman cause it always been right.
---
Undead priest for that pocket heals.
---
Troll rogue cause I'm a POS.
---
For me it was the ivory raptor. It will forever be my Classic WoW white whale...until I farm for it.
---
Assuming it will be in the game that is..
---
Game plan: orc maybe troll shaman if buddy goes tauren warrior.  
---
Dwarf priest if he chooses Alli
---
Hi, /u/Muufokfok
---
Found my old photobucket account with shots from the first few weeks of launch. Going to upload to imgur and post, since photobucket is trash now
---
My buddy might roll alliance, nelf warrior. If that's the case Im going nelf druid for funsies or human paladin for the mace/sword buff (pocket heals both.)
---
As much as my horde background hates for me to admit it, nelf druids and human pallies look cool as hell.
---
All races are cool in their own way, I love all of them. Although gnome priest would make choices easy for me
---
Photobucket? I haven't heard that name in years.
---
And a 6 pack of generic 3 cup bowls is like $3.
---
Or a gnome with a Kodo after brewfest
---
This makes me sad, because theres a 100% chance that its going to happen. I hope they can accept the truth when proven wrong instead of digging in their heels and doubling down.
---
I just logged into mine and the recovery email was from when i had DSL internet still... and all my photos were low def lol
---
Thanks for sharing your story. I still have some items with old friends' names on them too, as well as in-game mail I saved from them.
---
Death Knights are the only class that starts at level 55 so I'm guessing you're remembering stuff you heard about then-upcoming Wrath of the Lich King xpac which was announced during BC.
---
It's wonderful that you've been able to continue through this life, to the point that now events from the time of your illness are memories from long in the past. 
---
If I recall, in vanilla I only got one faction to exalted. I was an Orc, and it was Orgrimmar. I remember a TON of turn ins in Alterac Valley for some reason.... I don't remember the details, but I remember I did a truckton of AV, and for some reason I remember getting exalted with the Frostwolf Clan, and then actually getting Exalted with Org too. Ill have to research, but something in the BG gave Org rep IIRC.
---
So I click the Thottbot theme switcher and it redirects me to the login page.  
---
Requiring a login to use the new theme or am I missing something?  
---
I used to do this on my bed and a small lamp table next to my bed holding my monitor.  During my uber-lazy days.  Occasionally hurt my neck lol
---
Keep in mind that stockades is full of humans, who run, a lot. And they are very tightly packed together, so if you’re trying to speed run it at a normal level, better have a good group or a high level helper 
---
Even if they do dedicate resources to new, original, Classic content, that content won't feel like vanilla does.  Even if they got the whole original vanilla WoW team back together, the design of vanilla was a product of its time.  It was lightning in a bottle created by the hyper-passionate mindset the devs were in, the state of the industry in the early 2000's, their technical limitations, and honestly a lot of dumb luck.
---
You can't put a bunch of 2019 Blizzard devs in a room and tell them to make "something like BWL."  It's a whole different team and even if it wasn't they wouldn't be the same people these days.  Heck even if they WERE they wouldn't be able to make what the community wants, because if they had the tools to do it in 2004 LFR probably would have been in from the start.
---
He wants blood elves.

Now, many people are going to cringe mega hard when I say this, but I moved my WASD keys to be ESDF instead for movement. This allows easier typing (since already on home row), access to QAZ for binding, easier to hit 5 and 6 keys. I didn't change this until Wrath, and it took me about a month to get used to. Works for me though and adds easier to hit 'reflexive' buttons for pvp.
---
Ugh
---
Yes. All of that. I’m wondering if the GG button Pom pyro will be a part of the classic experience. Based on patch start data, I’m thinking no, but no ZG right away either, so who knows. I grinded to rank 11 with that button and then got all the mounts and stopped. Only to see about a month later they announced the “new” epic pvp gear for ranks 12-14, but I had already decayed back to 6 by then :(
---
Am I wrong?  
---
Is the progression of WOTLK now  1-&gt;80-&gt;heroics-&gt;ICC heroics-&gt;ICC   
---
It takes 1 full week to clear the entire game start to finish
---
I know people would get too mad over it being banned but I agree. Too much of what made Vanilla Vanilla will be modernified by addon makers which will make the game unfair for people who play Classic to play it like it should be.
---
A patch release schedule could easily be done to mimic original release. That’s kind of the point. 
---
I think addons should be allowed. They were allowed in vanilla, and should be allowed in classic.
---
The *'addons shouldn't play the game for you'* argument is valid. They shouldn't. Bliz **does** ban folks that use mods that play the game for you. Even using KB macros to perform a spell rotation is bannable, historically. 
---
The hard part of your argument is the "what is a *good* addon?" question. One could argue that DPS meters are also 'against the spirit' of vanilla - since you're focusing on numbers and metrics instead of mechanics (e.g. spoofing meters on critters or whatever). One could also argue that UI addons are 'against the spirit of vanilla' because they break immersion. 
---
I'm not saying these are fantastic arguments - but they are ones that need to be addressed - and there really isn't a body to address that (outside of the devs themselves - and I don't reckon they will).
---
I do think that bliz should do *anything they can* to stop 'groupfinder' addons, etc. Things that fundamentally change the experience for folks *not* using addons. But bigwigs/dbm -- I'm totally fine with. 
---
What happens to people rerolling after the release of ICC heroics/ new players?
---
bit different on warriors sub level 40 because that tiny regen benefit is huge on them.
---
Make your own guild, make it know you want hand of rag, make guild successful enough to accomplish that task plus farm BWL, guild will understand if you build a GOOD guild. Server I was on in classic had a Druid who demanded to be a boomkin.... before boomkin... and would roll on cloth gear frequently. He made his own guild and got into naxx by the end. His guild was cool with it since they knew his deal up front. 
---
Dire maul was my favorite, cuz it had awesome mage stuff and was the prettiest dungeon being over in elf land 
---
There is absolutely no longevity in Wrath servers, it makes absolutely no financial sense to ever launch them
---
No one would ever stick around to keep playing because all content would be skippable, once you complete the game you cant level alts because your alts can skip 99% of content to the end game and be done immediately. 
---
The only thing that would last is PVP but with TBC being out I would assume more people would choose that over WOTLK for pvp
---
No man, they're busy integrating pet battles. I'm sure that is it.
---
They will *destroy* your mouth.
---
No news means no changes, right?
---
**&lt;Undaunted&gt; - Horde |NA-PVP| semi-hardcore**
---
Undaunted is recruiting members prior to the release of classic wow. Welcoming all players that are experienced or new with determination to progress at a steady rate and dedication on making the guild a better experience overall. We want to have a strong core of members when the game launches.
---
This guild will be semi-hardcore, Horde, and with a laid back demeanor but still seeking to progress with a goal to leave no one behind for those that show up on raid times, etc. Ideally a strong core roster of experienced players would be preferred to help out around the guild and bring everyone up to speed. We want a good sense of community within this guild so don’t be afraid to speak up and talk to others, in the end remember to just have fun with the game as well.
---
We will be doing PVE and PVP content with raids times being listed below but we do enjoy world pvp when we get the chance, perhaps even forming BG groups later on when they get introduced. When raiding starts we will be doing 3 nights a week. We are currently recruiting all classes, just play what you feel like. We have chosen to run with the suicide kings loot distribution method as well.
---
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday - 7:30 - 10:30 est
---
We currently have a discord channel that is fresh, still getting everyone invited to it. We have tabs for class/dungeon guide talk to help people out not familiar with classic wow and you can usually find me in general voice chat. Feel free to add me on discord or bnet for more info on joining it.
---
Bnet: Feral#11785 Discord: Feral#0846
---
They already said they will limit addon functionality, because there can be addons that reimplement LFG, automate gameplay, etc.
---
There aren't too many that are against this sort of curating of mod functionality.
---
i thought everyone used a adblocker by now =|
---
Hehe my gnome warrior named Mousse farmed for the  NE saber mount. Too cool hehe
---
With the large amount of Spellpower available on 1.12 gear, AP PoM Pyro cheese will definitely be a thing. If you're on a PvP server, you can pretty much one shot anybody who hasn't gotten the PvP set or T1 yet.
---
&gt;  Do as many quests for the rep you want as possible 
---
You realize this has no base? Some reps have much more reps via quests than others. 
---
I've got a buddy who immediately went into a financial turtle mode the day Classic was announced. He invested some in the stock market, too. He plans on quitting his job the day the game launches. I asked him about it a few months back. He said he'd probably got close to a year of funds saved up before he has to start looking for a job again.
---
Sulfuron ingots $20/each?
---
This argument shows such an incredible lack of comprehension of how games work I'm not going to put too much effort into explaining to you any better.
---
But like a Blizzard dev said at GDC: Given the opportunity players will optimize out the fun from a game.
---
Meaning that there needs to be incentives built into a game. Raids are fun, zones are fun, but people ultimately do what they do in an MMO to progress toward a goal.
---
I'd prefer DM be progressed just like many other knowledgeable people.
---
That being said, I was one of the class officers (caster) in a hardcore progression guild, and it's actually a misconception that MC gear is useless.
---
Everyone knew about addons in Vanilla and they were far from basic considering every addon you listed was created during Vanilla. An addon like Questie was created AFTER Vanilla.
---
The biggest problem is macros not necessarily addons. 
---
As it stands right now there are ZERO addons for Classic when it releases.
---
I disagree on that they break immersion.. I use add-ons to make my ui as minimalistic as possible for more immersion. 
---
I dream of a day people will edit their content.
---
SM and DireMaul. 
---
Thanks everyone for all the awesome responses! I'll wait a little closer to launch to buy a new chair but i'll def bookmark this thread.
---
To be fair I was just searching for the alterac quests in general and their usage on the battlefield. There are not many submissions for it. I started watching this, huh by soupasoka, had downtime at work and watched it.   
---
But yes the better edited content creators for classic are far more enjoyable to watch
---
Fuck loot council AND personal loot.
---
Well the part I linked starts at him saying "I am 51 I really should not be here, I do not suggest this." But yes I agree, 10 level difference is such a huge gap. This is not worth doing til 58 at least
---
Hell yeah. Glad to help.
---
Also now that I think about it,since you are horde, the rogues wont be humans and they wont have +skill to swords so you will be able to beat them even more with edgemasters gauntlets that they cant wear haha. Also windfury should scale even better with rage generation than a rogue would too since they only get the extra attack but you get the extra attack AND extra rage from it
---
Yep, it's called ZG and AQ20. If guild needs class X and they know the person is a great player they will take them and quickly gear them for their raid level. 
---
Even in June 2020 we should still have raids going on in MC. It will be PUG cleared by then and I'd assume there will still be weekly PUG groups.
---
It really depends on the release schedule for content patches.
---
You are in luck. This is probably the most authentic way to play World of Warcraft. Honestly all the quest chains are unique and interesting. Slow down and travel from area to area and read the quests. 
---
But here's a few of my favorite chains on Horde:
---
Ordanus + Stonetalon peak (25-30)
---
Battle of Hillsbrad (25-30)
---
The Blackened Shield (40ish)
---
Actually pretty much all of Dustwallow Marsh.
---
Mok'Thardin's Enchantments (35-40)
---
Shadra + Jintha'Alor Quests in the Hinterlands (45-50)
---
That's mostly it. I've never done Jadenarr but plan on doing it this time.
---
And most of the guilds I’ve been in fall under the same category.
---
But you still were using DKP and it’s hard to believe you failed to see any guilds with no DKP system.
---
You like fish sticks?
---
I all for supporting websites that I believe deserve the ad revenue by turning off my ad blocker, but Wowhead...
---
I can't. I think my browser will explode if I allow the endless barrage of ads to load. I remember hitting 4 digits on my "ads blocked" by just browsing for a bit. It was ridiculous. 
---
One time I was asked to run two people through Gnomer on my mage.  I didn't have anything to do so I went ahead and started running them through.  At some point a guildie asked me if I wanted to run UBRS.  I had never done it and was stoked at the prospect of a semi-raid.  I abandoned those two poor souls somewhere in those tinkery halls.  I don't think I even made them a portal; I'm pretty sure I just teleported myself out of there.
---
Yeah, I still feel a bit bad about that one.
---
Isn’t it being hypocritical to say someone was implying it happens all the time, whereas you are implying it rarely happens?
---
Thanks for the reply!
---
Yes I do know this is the case. However, Thunder Bluff is known to be one of the harder reputations to get Exalted with, which is why I’ve used this as my test faction.
---
your missing his point. He said one might say ui addons ruin immersion. 
---
It’s called devils advocate.
---
Thanks for the reply.
---
I used Thunder Bluff for my test because its known to be one of the harder ones to get exalted with and therefore the info can still apply to other factions
---
&gt;As it stands right now there are ZERO addons for Classic when it releases.
---
I wonder if the demo gave these addon writers (coders? artists? whatever) enough information to build anything for Classic launch. I'm sure whatever addons available on launch would be buggy as hell though.
---
(Not saying we should/need addons on launch or not, just a thought.)
---
There are already servers up for each expansion and there are alive and popular realms for each.
---
If your going to get gkicked for taking 1 item. Might as well take it all.
---
We want to tell you that we are working on things but we can't tell you what they are, so... erm here is us communicating that to you.
---
I suggest you find a warlock for summons otherwise it's just super inefficient
---
Yeah, my original concern was that without having a threat reduction ability that I will just be throttled by tank threat on a Warrior while a Rogue can just vanish and reset himself.
---
All of them!
---
But really, anything past Sunken Temple. I never did any of that, started playing in BC.
---
ah god even though the logical part of me wants to say there's no way that they're THAT stupid.....they announced a mobile game to close out their convention so anything is possible
---
Kodo and tigers are the best mounts 
---
&gt; Back in the day, many of us didn't even know what addons were, and the ones that were there were so basic to the point where you wouldn't notice too much that it was an unfair advantage. 
---
this is inherently false
---
Well look at the way charge and summon worked in the demo vs how they work on private servers. Blizzard have gone back to the original 1.12 server and client and verified that they were correct in the demo but private server players still don't accept that.
---
The point is that when any one particular server progresses to a new expansion (optional transfer) it completely robs if not completely kills the existing server for the sake of the new expansion, which itself is a portion of the original population.
---
Of course that means that there are currently Vanilla servers, TBC servers, etc. But when any one particular Vanilla server progresses, it significantly maims if not outright kills that existing server.
---
People follow the latest hyped server. It's to be expected. If you stagger it every 2 years maybe at the end of tbc they launch wrath and a new vanilla realm. Maybe they do it like Diablo seasons and they implement new content. What if the second time around they did 1.0 talents? Or they did additional content, class retuning etc etc. the sky is the limit really. This should be enough to rope players back in who maybe have done the vanilla content once or twice.
---
Yeah you are correct, that is definitely a problem and you will run into that early on. 
---
It can be frustrating at times, but for me it never bothered me because I knew why they were beating me and knew that when it truly mattered on progression content I would be the #1 spot. Rogues will generally beat you in 5 man instances since the mob will die as they dump their energy bar but before you have a chance to build rage. But it doesnt matter because whatever its a 5man haha. The execute phases on bosses when half the raid is dead and its just you with all your consumes and cds perfectly lined up and a double crusader proc on top of a juju flurry is just insane.
---
beautiful
---
Bc is dogshit 
---
Did some research and would like to switch things around.
---
1. Warrior 2. Rogue 3. Hunter 4. Mage 5. Priest
---
Thinking I might go troll hunter maybe orc hunter. Miss the good old days of being a hunter. My first class starting in the burning crusade as a night elf.
---
Starting in Wetlands at 25, you can get all the quests and do the dungeon in about an hour. A lock would get rid of the 15 minute travel time to get quests and get to SW, but then the lock and 2 others wouldn't be able to do the quest, since they'd need to be in SW to summon.
---
So you have inside information? They did not confirm not to have it. And tbh sharding is as bad, stuff popping in and out and "loading" when entering zones.
---
Yeah I def did that on my grind. My job was nuke the flag carrier every 3 minutes. They added a cool down between using multiple trinkets though at some point, I can’t remember if that was in 1.12 or in tbc. 
---
No changes.
---
Does the same for me as well
---
Okay, here we go. This is the first example I took a look at to see if is this topic was valid...
---
Chen’s Empty Key - Classic WoWHead

Comment on the third quest (dated 30 April 2006):

[“Exp and reputation:

1st part of quest: 625 exp and 50 Orgrimmar reputation
---
2nd part of quest: 825 exp and 50 Orgrimmar reputation
---

---
Literally proven incorrect based on data found on their own website. Just averaging those three quests in the chain makes their figures 200% what the actual values should be.
---
Sounds like a no thanks from me. I'll be avoiding WoWhead for Classic. Not because of this, but because of /u/mDovekie comment in this same thread.  
---
Does stoneform remove bleeds like rend? I thought it only removed diseases and poisons.
---
It's the announcement of announcements.  Straight out of Path of Exile's playbook.
---
You still get videos and banners that self-advertise.
---
Looking forward to full runs of Maraudon. With a good group, that's one of the biggest adventures in vanilla. I love fighting through the muck, slime, demons and all other kinds of hell and coming out to the beautiful Earthsong Falls. And that's just the beginning.
---
Jokes on you for playing a make character ;) 
---
I think his joke was the fact that he owns Tupperware. 
---
I agree, but do yourself a favor and buy pancetta. I know, it's basically the same as bacon. But man, it goes so much better. 
---
I just want the other two for cool gear
---
This reminds of the time the epic robe actually dropped from the lich in Scholo. The Priest who won was hyped, and is also now hot pink 24/7 lol.
---
What Made You Start Each Word With A Capital Letter?
---
Better than them saying nothing.
---
How do they pull him? What about supression room? 
---
At Blizzcon didn't they address this?
---
They said something like addons for Classic will be more restricted than retail, since some addons would go against the spirit of Vanilla.
---
&gt; While not all addons are bad, WOW has progressed a lot in the 15 odd years since release. Back in the day, many of us didn't even know what addons were, and the ones that were there were so basic to the point where you wouldn't notice too much that it was an unfair advantage.
---
&gt;However as wow has aged, more and more addons have entered the game. so much so i believe its taking the fun and skill out of it. Some are completely just not in the spirit of Vanilla wow. Not to mention addons which can run your whole rotation while you just move, if you even have to do that.
---
...Decursive. Literally lets me spam my remove curse button and it would auto target someone with a curse on them.  Yes it existed in preBC. Other required add-ons were CTmod and Omen(think it was omen threat).
---
Agreed. Or get fancy and throw in some liquid of your choice while still on the stove, make a parchment cartouche to trap the steam and braise that shit up
---
I think we’ll have to agree to disagree. For me, the drop in interaction was across the realm. I no longer saw people I was the same level, people who quested the same area as me I never got the chance to know. I wasn’t a guild person, and stopped raiding seriously midway through Cata. My guild was my high school group of friends and college broke us up as we all went to different places. 
---
So I noticed a big change. Seems most people agree, sharding is bad. The apologists seem to be the ones who feel its end game and nothing else matters. 
---
It Took Longer To Write It So I Could Procrastinate Sleeping Even Though I Have Work In 4 Hours. It Also Looks Nicer To My Brain
---
Fair enough 👌
---
To answer your question, ill probably stick around too long, even if they mess it up with silly changes.
---
I don't think they care at all, and they certainly don't care enough about a temporary fluctuation to change their operations. 
---
Cash shop. It's ruined every game I've played since vanilla. 
---
As a Warrior you're better off farming nodes, soloing elite mobs isn't ideal. 
---
In other words, the life of every alliance solo queuer. 
---
It'd be a much harder concept to pull off in WoW but Old School Runescape has an almost flawless anti-powercreep design. Most new items aren't strict upgrades in all areas and are tier-capped at 75 out of 99, whereas the most efficient gear in 2007 was tier 70. Runescape is also able to use degradable items as a concept though.
---
By 60 content I also mean pre-60 as well.
---
Fuck I remember that, I got temp banned from the forums for that incident
---
It’s hard to say definitively that it would be splitting the player base. I’d bet the majority of players in classic wow will be unsubs returning from over a decade of failed expansions. Players uninterested in the etiquette and effort required for classic will go back to their instant queue dungeon finders.
---
That main hand for casters, though. Never saw it drop, but I saved so much DKP for that thing.
---
Def interested, commenting to save I’ll try and get at ya on discord
---
A lot of Classic players would also play BC or Wrath as they currently do on private servers. Most of them that do that also don't really invest MUCH time outside of their preferred set other than raidlogging, hence it would still be splitting the playerbase. 
---
Take a can of black beans. Toss in a pot with a bit of water and half a packet of taco seasoning. 
---
Cook it until it’s hot. If you leave it on low heat you can legit go run a dungeon and come back and it’ll be fine. 
---
When it’s hot spoon it into a bowl and drain it as much as possible. Shred cheese over it. Crumble in some tortilla chips. 
---
You can also add in salsa, guacamole, sour cream, onion, cilantro, etc depending on what you have available. 
---
It’s a really solid meal, and absurdly easy to make. 
---
UBRS was my favorite when it was a 10 man dungeon. Killing Rend for his polearm (that never freakin dropped for me)
---
Any over use of sharding. You just cant make real connections when people are randomly disappearing as you’re running through zones. Cash shops are also a no-go, everything in Classic should be earned in game.
---
I use it for every game now. It's second nature. 
---
unbanned now
---
There are a few ways you could do this. I think there was a spot near the gate where you could pull him before suppression. Or slip through the gate or have a rogue stealth up.  You then just need to train all the adds away and have someone pull the boss out of the pack without agroing anything else.  The guy who pulled just needs to vanish, feign, or die and the rest of the room would reset. 
---
Thanks for this!
---
This is basically proof that no one REALLY knows how rep will work in classic. This is very strange seeing as the quest says it grants 100 rep on classicdb, buy the poster says they only got 50. Modern WoWhead shows 250 rep for this quest. The comment you’ve shown also includes the fact that they were an Undead character (only horde race that starts with the other 3 factions at neutral).
---
Wondering if you got half the rep for Neutral factions in Vanilla? Or maybe they are correct. All in all the reality is that no one can know for sure.
---
Again, thank you for the research on the topic. We all appreciate it
---
I had all of them 3 :((
---
Shockingly, the link actually works!
---
&gt;Wondering if you got half the rep for Neutral factions in Vanilla?
---
No, current reputation rank had no effect on individual gains (or losses)
---
Meat and veggie Crockpot, cheese and cracker snacks and fried tofu for me
---
\#NoChanges
---
Except that the Rams are better!
---
How do you do the grind usually? Just find all TB related quests?
---
Very interesting point. 
---
The reason I was pondering this im the first place is that most post-2.0 patch research I have done shows that rep gain from quests is approximately double of what the classic WoWhead shows.
---
It really makes you wonder how they got the rep gain information that they have. Thottbot was a pretty big thing in Vanilla so one would think that they would be accurate.
---
I don't have a "last straw" in mind. But whatever it is it's probably something they are doing that we don't know about yet. Or a change that seems innocuous to us now ends up being game breaking. Everything in bfa is impersonal or interchangable and if classic feels like that I'll be gone. 
---
I would be surprised if there wasn't a open beta at some point, like a no-subscription-required beta for a few days that sets people at like level 30 with all the major game functionality active (trainers, auction house). 
---
Something like this is pretty essential is order to get SOME level of how many servers to put at launch. Yeah there will be sharding, but ideally you don't want 50k people per server if there is more demand than anticipated.
---
tl;dr "it's still happening guys, stop fucking asking"
---
I would pay a higher subscription, no hesitation to avoid playing a pay to win game.
---
Pay to play, not pay to win. Super simple stuff ppl. 
---
Loot councils can be prone to corruption, but then again, there's 100% transparency on where each piece goes. If the officers get all the good loot and everyone else gets the scraps, the guild isn't gonna last long. 
---
Usually loot councils just give the piece to the class for which it's BiS, and within that class whoever has the bigger upgrade from the piece. Loot goes to core raiders before the guys who just joined for obvious reasons. 
---
Loot council is almost always better than any other method simply because the raid's gear as a whole progresses faster. 
---
Letting people bid on items with DKP means some people will let upgrades go to pool up points/some pieces might go to someone that will replace them eventually instead of going to a BiS. Pure random /rolls are absolute garbage. +1 systems means that everyone will let upgrades get DE just so they can roll on a better upgrade if it drops. 
---
We actually cleared to him and it was late at night as we had connection/queue issues. And decided to experiment. This was patched after a week.
---
&gt; have supplies ready, comes with the right tallents etc.
---
Which directly translates into dps. Especially in vanilla where there's very little mechanics involved, whoever has the most stats wins every time. 
---
It's cuz of the server we played on. You could still get proc rates in cat or bear form and we crunched the numbers and it worked out to be great for bears. It sounds super silly I know but blame the server coding.
---
In no way am I going to recommend someone try to raid as bear tank let alone try to roll for the Eye when Classic goes live
---
\&gt; Until BfA, Cata was the worst expansion. 
---
wod would like a word.
---
Most people agree -here-. The vocal minority. There will always be people too busy playing to post, which are a large, large group of people, who would be hard to interview on the subject. 
---
Agree to disagree, indeed. Have a nice week!
---
LOL I'd quit a guild so fast if they gave Eye of Sulfuras to a druid, even if I wan't in the running. I can't be seen in a meme guild, which is what they'd become.  
---
Bind your movement keys so that there's only WASD, and that A/D are strafing instead of turning. You will turn with your mouse, and you can always turn with the keyboard arrows for RP reasons.
---
Bind stuff to QERTY and 123456. Add Shift and CTRL modifiers. You can also bind stuff to mouse buttons if you have some of them. I personally have two that I use as trinket1/trinket2, since I play hunter and hunter is the class that uses the most trinkets. I've also bound G U and I. G is my mount button while U and I are my dispels on casters and pet macros on hunter.
---
The farther things are from your WASD, the more situational and less often you'll use those spells. For example: Q is my start autoshot macro, I spam it every fight. E is my pvp trinket, AKA my "oh shit" button. CTRL+6 is aspect of the wild, which I almost never use. Also keep in mind that Shift is a closer modifier than CTRL. I generally put my aspects or cooldowns on CTRL modifiers while putting my regular spells on Shift or no modifier.
---
As a closing note, don't put stuff you'll spam while moving on 1, since it's really annoying to reach with your index. Put things that have a (short) cool down like Fire Blast or Cone of Cold but don't put Arcane Explosion there. When movement gets heavy it gets really frustrating to hit 1 while also pressing A or D.
---
I don't get it. What's the point of leaving the guild once you're decked out? Just stay in it and get decked out in the next patch's gear as well.
---
A guild that spends the ingots worth 10k on a status symbol rather than flasks for progression is more of a meme guild than a guild that gives a useless weapon to a druid. The weapon is for showing off anyways.
---
A guild that gives their first Thunderfury to a rogue is a meme guild. A guild that gives their first Sulfuras to a druid isn't a meme guild.
---
I expect to be sick for a couple of days at launch. I think I'm getting a sore throat already.
---
Imagine not trusting your officers but trusting randos to not collude within their own class to keep the bids low on their class specific items so they can outbid everyone else on non class specific items. DKP can be abused and it results in an overall worse raid gear progression. 
---
Hang tight, https://www.classicwow.live/ working hard to bring a fresh alternative :)
---
Decay or not, you only need to be above the next guy who wants the loot, and his DKP decays as well. 
---
Sounds like what they said on the Diablo forums before telling everyone to actually not get that excited before announcing an outsourced mobile port of an old game.
---
Zul'Gurub. That's the one I watched my parents raid countless times. Remember building the opening area and bridge out of lego. Going through that portal is going to be a trip.
---
I did ORG as a Tauren. Super worth it. 
---
Stock drops 10%. Better make an update about how we're working on making an updated.
---
Me too!
---
The trick is to level fast enough and then be the ganker.
---
People seem to miss that part.
---
I don’t understand why people say this. The wolves are extra big and the Tauren fit really nice on them
---
You have to understand that reputation was almost entirely hidden in vanilla. All the game showed you of your reputation was a progress bar. The only data the game provided in the LUA was the percentage of each bar. You needed an addon to display the units which was made possible by reverse engineering the values from the percentages, and tracking reputation changes to show them in the chat/combat log. 
---
Yessss! I did it in Vanilla. My Tauren Warrior looked dope in preBiS on the Timber Wolf
---
Anyone else plan on running no addons, but keeping something like this on alt-tab to refer to just like the old days.
---
While that is true, it is not likely to be common. 20man binding run, sure absolutely. 20man full run, probably not. Most guilds still need need loot off of many bosses in MC while still progressing AQ40.
---
I was in the process of editing my post to do so but I already hit Post
---
*cough* Darksear *cough*
---
omg a blue post
---
They've actually been moved to a separate sub until after the initial announcement of whether or not sharding will happen, but will be reintegrated after the debate dies down.
---
Anyone else not excited about beta?
---
Whats the point, its not a new game, if we wanted to try it out there's other options.
---
I'd just like a release date.
---
What is it with all these threads about getting legendary weapons? There's one every few days.
---
Each of those threads is always about "how do I get..?" When it should be "why would my guild give me...?".
---
I didn't say anything here about giving the ingots to anyone, only the eye. Say whatever you want to sound cool, but any guild giving Eye of Sulfuras to a druid is immediately a meme guild.  
---
Nice, a neanderthal mass downvote brigade. Cute. Danish word for kiss.
---
I’m actually a relatively new subscriber here. I was first introduced to the notion most people disliked sharding in the game, thenon the WoW forums, before I sub’d to the WoW subreddit where it seemed to be more reinforced. Here, I’ll agree it definitely is something of note, but that’s because it wasn’t in classic. 
---
Jesus christ dont talk about the stock market
---
The entire stock market across the board fell like 20%
---
Then video games as an industry took another 10% hit ontop of that
---
Blizzards stock would have fell regardless of what they do
---
Hunter is one of the highest skill cap classes and also has a low floor. The meme is "huntard" which is a little harsh but true imo. 
---
So unless you are able to learn to play the class well - yes, you may have difficulty finding a raid slot as not many guilds will be keen to take on poor DPS. 
---
It depends on many things. But mostly a supply and demand issue. 40 player raids will have roughly 2-5 slots available for hunters (typically more slots in MC/Ony, fewer slots in Nax).  Depends on class makeup within the server population. If too many people main hunter compared to other classes, then getting a slot is going to be challenging unless you can make a name for yourself. But if you put the effort in; come prepared with consumables, optimise your talents for raiding, understand the encounters, and know how to play your class, you're going to be valuable asset to a raid regardless. 
---
Group finder and/or teleportation to dungeons.
---
i would actually play a mobile wow pet battle game
---
Hunters are popular, but there is huge amount of mediocre-bad hunters running around. As long as you commit to your guild, are consistent with your raid attendance, prepare in advance and dont fail, guilds will appreciate you. All throughout the content, hunters do work that is easily punishable if done wrong. They do all the pulling and kiting - and when you fail at it, it usually means wipe. So consistent and reliable hunters are treasured.
---
I definitely remember coming back to wow after military service and gering up to T9 while standing in Dalaran. And this was when ICC just got released so no Cata Prepatch.
---
I consider this news though :-)
---
Wait, really? Tauren cant use skeletal horse or raptor faction mounts in vanilla?
---
We need a beta in order to check if everything is good at the release date. There is no way they can make it perfect on the first try. 
---
I am excited by it because it is yet another natural step forward.
---
No loot trading, no sharding, no right-click auto reporting, no cash shops.
---
Just pure vanilla - that's all the news I would like to hear. :/
---
Hopefully they will tell us they're removing loot sharing and will instead create multiple of the same realms then merge them after a while, do you are still on the same realm and everyone keeps their names 
---
So, is there a specific animation for raptor strike?
---
And this threat is TOTALLY based on engineering AND a few seconds of head start... 
---
No they aren’t. There is no cash shop 
---
People are looking for any sign that blizzard is failing, they’re like vultures 
---
I'm kinda relieved that the soon(tm) meme is back because that's the Blizzard I used to know. The Blizzard that would take ages to produce stuff, but the stuff produced was the best it could ever be (except DS). Lately they've made a bunch of hasty and dumb decisions so I'm hoping this means they are going back to their roots.
---
Flying mounts almost done 😍
---
Just buy all your skills, youll probably have enough money to support your warrior anyway since your lvl 40 mount is free.
---
I was able to fulfill my dream on a pserver by buying the arctic wolf. When classic comes along, I will nolife my way to the Horn of the Red Wolf AND Horn of the Arctic Wolf. They both look just gorgeous.
---
I did not like the WC3 much, but the wolf is AWESOME and exactly how I imagine the wolf mount to be. Not just some dumb goat carrying you onto the battlefield, but a full fletched companion you share your adventures with!
---
I agree with your first bit. But the 2nd just sounds not necessary and would piss a lot of people off lol. If I understand it correctly
---
Those Mousebuttons I use for per attack/come back on hunter and Cat/bear for druid. Really convenient.
---
Where you go around your town and find references to Azeroth. Like go down to your local supermarket and it's "Stormwind Trade District"  
---
And you catch the "pokemon" with your phone.  
---
WoW-Go or something.
---
We got things to tell and show you, but we don't want to show and tell you the things, yet. But there are things.
---
Not really fair, a lot of games have been great in early access. Dead Cells and Rimworld, for example.
---
&gt; There is no cash shop  
---
*They said while slutching their legs in fetal position, rocking back and forth. "no cash shop.... no cash shop...."*
---
Wow tokens.
---
No, there just isn’t a cash shop. It’s vanilla. There was no cash shop in vanilla 
---
In this case, it's probably "changes compared to what you saw in the demo". Which should be good, hopefully.
---
Loot trading is a necessary evil that we going to have to live with in a world of cost cutting CS representatives.
---
Sharding they already said will be in at the beginning and will find reasons to keep it in when ever they want to.  Remember they are going to be using the same hardware they are using on retail servers for classic, that means a 15v15 man raid needs to be sharded to keep server stability just like in retail!
---
I want to believe in Classic but I also know Blizzard will mess it up just like they messed up retail.
---
I was goin RP-PvP so I'll have to pick this up then. When do you use searing pain in PvP? Just as a finisher?
---
Not gonna lie to you. Hunter raiding will require a lot of dedication and practice. You will have to work to prove yourself worthy of your spot way more than other classes due to your DPS issues.
---
Hopefully, we will see my man.
---
Hi, /u/Anosognosia
---
If only brewfest was in vanilla
---
You are way too optimistic, they most certainly can get it right on the first try.  Closed beta listen to feed back, insert feedback.  Open beta listen to feedback insert feedback.  Pre-launch beta accept and listen to all negative feedback and understand that sharding is actually a major step backwards when they don't invest in a good tech for their servers.
---
Log In Theme not bad
---
Just didn't want to make it looks like I didn't learn anything.
---
Oh you sweet, sweet summer child. 
---
In all seriousness, I hope to god there is no MTX whatsoever. It is Activison, however, and they will more than likely milk this cash cow dry.
---
There has been absolutely nothing to suggest there  will be a cash shop.
---
What an utterly idiotic thing to say.
---
Sick man! I'd do this for my Warlock if I wasn't poor. It'd mostly be painting my bedroom black and covering the windows with "felcloth" drapes. Maybe a bubbling Halloween prop cauldron in the center of the room. Maybe with some slowed down/sped up gregorian chanting on youtube.
---
All I want is a release date so I can put in for a couple of vacation days 😜
---
Numbers 1-9
---
Shift+numbers 1-9
---
ctrl+numbers 1-9
---
shift+mouse scroll to toggle between bars (great for warriors due to stances)
---
R, F, T, Y, U, X, V, Q, E, Z, G = all good letters for important binds that you want within quick reach. Some of them are already taken by default things but mostly funtions that you dont need on a "good" bind that could easily be relegated to a bad bind.
---
Buy a Razer Naga, done.
---
You basically have an entire action bar at your tumb. And you can use control and shift to get another 2.
---
I should have expected this from a dirty magram dog. Your "clan" doesn't even deserve capitalization. It should come as no surprise that the caring and wise women of the Gelkis' charms are lost on dirty brutes who wallow in muck and mud while we enjoy our enchanted caverns and magical prowess.
---
Engineering is MANDATORY for any tank that wants to be successful in PvE. The other profession doesnt really matter though. BS can be good for mithril insignia trinket that gives fear break if you're horde and non-undead.
---
Bro you are getting way too worked up. You are really setting yourself up for failure by believing that Activison Blizzard will not milk Classic WoW for everything they can. Just accept that they will, and if they don't (they will) you can be happy. 
---
I could live without Wrath. That was the start of the downfall with the introduction if LFD. 
---
Nice find! It is always nice to see a confirmation.
---
Like I said, there is absolutely nothing to suggest there will be a cash shop. You’re the only one getting worked up over nothing.
---
As others have mentioned, you'll go pretty far if you're decent at the class and make a bit of a name for yourself within the guild.  Especially early on during the leveling process.  It's so much faster than any other class that you'll have to force yourself to slow down in order to participate with guild members. Gotta build those rep points.
---
The ceiling is high and it's easy for someone to observe your skill level due to vast amounts of abilities vs the ones you actually use.  I had more hotkeys and macros on my engi/hunter than any other class.
---
Worst case scenario and you end up rolling a diff raid class you'll always have that hunter for farming/wpvp and bgs.  They're fun AF at everything.
---
I think blizzard  is failing but I hate hearing retards talk about the stock market
---
Expect the worst, always be pleasantly surprised.
---
This wait is just too painful, I don't want any looter shooter coop stuff I just want classic wow. I just want to pay 15$ a month and play classic wow.
---
I have been playing Vermintide 2 and Warhammer total war
---
How is blizzard failing exactly? Did you see the amount of viewers for the world first race? The arena championship at blizzcon? The mdi? Let alone the multiple games they have running constantly bringing in revenue.
---
We may disagree with the quality of their games currently but blizzard are far from failing.
---
Level 60 boost, $60
---
can i just get a release date need to book some time off
---
&gt;  add cream and mushrooms
---
Okay but what's your carbonara recipe? Here is how you make carbonara: Mix eggs (optional: yolk only) and grated hard cheese (probably pecorino romano). Cook guanciale (optionally, pancetta or bacon). Cook spaghetti. Immediately after draining spaghetti, while it's still hot *but not actually on the hot stove*, mix it in with the egg, cheese, guanciale, and some pepper. And that's it!
---
I have no problem making a few bank alts, if this is a big concern. The biggest PITA is mailing things 1 at a time, but if someone's comitted they can definitely hoard stuff.
---
except for, youknow, activision putting them in every single game they release.
---
sure, there's a decent enough chance there won't be a cash shop at launch just to tiptoe around any outrage. I'd judge that at about 60% likely. 
---
but within a year it will have one, guaranteed.
---
&gt; Disgruntled World of Warcraft players are speaking out against Activision Blizzard turning the game into a cash cow with mediocre-to-boring content [Source](https://www.altchar.com/head-shots/584236/wow-players-are-calling-activision-blizzard-out)
---
Expect some form of MTX, and if there isn't then be happy. Activison-Blizzard's only goal is to make money; they are a publicly traded company.
---
Like I said, absolutely nothing to suggest there wi be a cash shop in classic wow.
---
Also activision isn’t doing anything. The company is know as activision blizzard. It’s one company.
---
Every gaming producer’s only goal is to make money. Just like every bakeries only goal is to make money.
---
Back in the day, AV could last for several days. 
---
Yes.
---
Projections for earnings from Activision blizzard are substantially less than they were last year so the price targets set for the company are literally half of what they were. Funds didnt sell off billions and billions of dollars of ActivisionBlizzard because the company is succeeding, they did it because they're falling
---
They're projections are garbage , they're company is garbage, and im going to short them until they go bankrupt 
---
Correct, and what do you think the Activision overlords would say when they realize they can make twice as much peddling MTX in Classic WoW?
---
Think of it like this: Runescape 3 has ~%20 of the players of OSRS, but makes WAY more money due to the insane amount of MTX available. 
---
Again, hopefully Classic WoW launches with no MTX, but don't hold your breath.
---
I would say no.
---
People keep saying that good hunters are indispensable, and that is true, but i remember raiding and we had a lot of hunters and not all of them were that great.
---
Keep in mind that raids are mostly 40-man activities. There will always be room for about 5 hunters.
---
If you wanna be smart and avoid the rat race though, study the raids and offer to be a raid leader. Then you can play whatever you want.
---
The entire gaming industry is going through a recession, blizzard isn’t failing, it’s following the market trend. 
---
This is such total bullshit from the typical wannabe-elitist - the kind of player I don't want to be in a group with.
---
No Profession is MANDATORY for anything. It just isn't. Many professions are certainly very helpful but calling them mandatory is just total bullshit.
---
And how much of the player base do you think will play if there is mtx?
---
They flip out when the word sharding is even mentioned let alone a cash shop.
---
Activision-blizzard May be a lot of things but they aren’t stupid, they know full well a cash shop would be suicide for classic wow and they aren’t going to risk the sizeable investment they have made. 
---
yeah, you keep telling yourself that.
---
I’m not telling myself anything.
---
Totems can be a love hate thing. One of my biggest hates as a totem is carefully setting up a stack of 4 and having the tank charge away from them all so no one really benefits from them. If you plan on being a shaman tank you won't have to deal with that! Good luck with the shaman tank, it's a fun experiment and is very cool when it works. As a shaman tank you have to be a bit more selfish with your totem choice which helps narrow down the huge number of totems for you.
---
 I won't envy you for all the hate you'll get, but in a complementary group (lots of CC) you can definitely change some people's minds. I leveled the first 35 levels as a tanky Tauren shaman on a private server. I never sought to be a tank unless we were looking for a tank for 30 mins and I was a decent level compared to it. I had a few fun pvp encounters with people who thought I was elemental specced due to the shield. I eventually respecced to ele because I wanted to change things up since I know I want to play enhance when classic actually comes.
---
Yes there is a recession in the gaming industry, which Is why I called out that other guy for criticizing blizzard falling as indicative of them filing, it is the DEGREE to which they fell which signifies it.
---
The gaming industry is expected to shrink in revenue next year, and as such gaming companies fell across the board around 10% . 
---
Blizzard however fell 50% because the projections for blizzard are substantially worse than every other company besides EA
---
If it isn’t at least some amount of trouble is it even worth it, like it’s got to be some kind of challenge.
---
Okay, but they aren’t failing, they are following the market trend.
---
 If gaming as a whole is projected to pull in 10% less revenue for the following year and blizzard is projected to pull in 50% less then it is THEM FAILLING
---
They are projected to do FAR WORSE than the market trend 
---
Your a retard, dont ever invest in the stock market you are absolutely irrational
---
I read *"I  myself look forward to* ***sharding****..."*   \-\_\_-
---
I guess a gm that is like that is only in it for personal gain. If you put in personal loot he is that guy that goes „gimme or /gkick!“ 
---
That would be a red flag fir me and a reason to switch guilds ASAP. 
---
You’re* I think we worked out who has the learning disability. Also enjoy the report for using a disability as an insult scum.
---
Oh you sweet, sweet, sweet summer child. You continue to be ignorant and wrong. They are a business, they will do what gets them the most money. Deal with it, and don't get your hopes up :).
---
I had like 10 to 1 returns this year in the stock market what about you?
---
I was actually born in winter, idk why you are trying to guess my birthday.
---
LFG LFR. 
---
Progression raid thru Wotlk was one of the best things that ever happen. 
---
The catchup system sucks, but it doesnt deny that it had some, if not the best raid ever and the best villain in WoWs history. 
---
Im very glad that I raided WotLK in a ”hardcore” manner and remember it that way. If anyone wants to play wotlk it should be on a fresh server that mimics the original release, just like Vanilla fanboys are playing on servers that mimic the org release of vanilla content. 
---
Imagine the dps with shamans and paladins. Raggy be dead before he can even tell he was summoned too soon. 😮
---
What about late comers?
---
If you start after the release of ICC then you will never have a reason to raid Ulduar
---
Let me rephrase then. It's mandatory in the sense that it will make content ALOT easier, and this is no overstatement. That being said, not having it will not keep you from clearing content, but it will make it harder.
---
Kodos look badass but their movement animations looks stupid af.
---
40 hours a week play even consider playing a warrior... thats the craziest one but there are TONS that are subjective lol.
---
I can agree. This whole 'make the share holder happy' is stupid. Share holders typically want a long term successful stable investment. Why do they want high risk  fail boat like everyone is saying.
---
It is absolutely vitally important that we don't allow Activision-Blizzard to put playable Ogres into classic wow. We need to stand firm and let them know, beyond a shadow of a doubt: NO OGRES. This is definitely the hill I've chosen to die on.
---
This. 
---
It was the end of Wrath that made it into a ”casual party”/handout game. 
---
If they make it a progression server just like the original, there is no ”catchup” unless you start playing with ToC release. 
---
Hunters are necessary for "Tranquilising Shot" on several raid encounters.
---
Their damage output is good for MC/BWL, my understanding is that it drops off in comparison to other classes after.
---
My pvt server guild only takes 3 hunters to each raid
---
They aren’t going to risk all the money they have poured into classic wow by adding a cash shop, it would be suicide for the game and they know it.
---
I imagine they need to get the corporate PR and management to sign off on anything they promise or say about classic, for fear of backlash if it isn't delivered. As individuals they are probably super hyped to tell us what they've been doing, but due to NDAs and other corporate mechanisms they just can't until sign off is given from someone else.
---
In that case @Ythisens#0001 post makes sense and if anything is nice to see soon™ resurrected.
---
Gold will be easier to obtain in classic than it was in vanilla so inflation will be an effect to take into account. This means it will cost alot more. I got sulfuras in TBC by paying for ingots laying around in old guildbanks. all-in-all i probably paid 2-3k gold. Later on private server N*stalrius I also got Sulfuras but this time around it was ALOT more expensive since gold was so abundant I had to pay about 1-1.25k for each ingot, totaling with arcanite bars and other mats I paid about 10-15k to make Sulfuras on private server.
---
I still like supporting sites I use that are helpful.  But excessive, predatory, or resource draining ones are a no-go for me, dawg.
---
K*onos LOL, what a silly server. Add that armor values on bosses are total f'ked up aswell inflating all dps.
---
I may grab things like Omen and recount, but I’ll likely be tabbing for the quests I just can’t figure out.  Not without trying myself first!
---
The staff is excellent. Good DPS and with spirit it helps those solo leveling.
---
Awesome I was waiting for this!
---
What exactly was bad about early cata? The fact that heroics were hard again? No easy epics? Good class mechanics? Good launch content? 
---
How you can say that Cata is worse than WoD, MoP (especially early MoP) or BfA, when these expansions had close to nothing going for them is beyond me.
---
møs
---
Even cloaking themselves in the mantle of "No changes!" there would be ways to sneak in monetisation. The first one would be the (currently) very rare collector's edition pets (Diablo, Zergling, Panda). Since they were from the original it would still skate by as being true to Vanilla to sell a "CE Upgrade" for say 50bucks (without adding them to your retail collection). And it would presumably sell very well since a lot of people still associate them with being rare and desirable despite the fact that limited supply factor would've been removed completely.
---
You could also start selling rewards from the trading game that were available back then, stuff like the frost tabard or the gordokk ogre suit (though they may have been from TBC era only).
---
Monetising Classic will take a defter touch, but im sure they'll try it.
---
It's just too... streamer-ey.
---
Better this than nothing. But since we got this post now rather than actual information, it probably means that we will need to wait another month.
---
Excellent suggestions.
---
Also, it might be a good thing to decide loot such as Sulfuras on beforehand. Doing all the above things, and having part of the mats (atleast the arcanite bars) will often work in your favour, basically showing yourself to be dedicated to make the hammer ASAP.
---
I do want the beta, so that the others can look for mistakes and blizz hopefully fix those.
---
I myself however, even if I get beta access I will still wait for the actual release.
---
Mobile. Yet another proof that mobile isn’t that great tbh. Who tf can type or game righn on mobile
---
“Put me into the group I should heal”. Never again please.
---
I like to puree black beans and cabbage. NOT canned beans. I'm talking about soaking it for a day and cooking it properly so there are no additives. Also fresh cabbage.
---
Use a little water to make it drinkable.
---
I put these in jars and freeze some to prepare my meals for the leveling. So I never have to actually cook anything. Really just unthaw and drink my food.
---
This is basically my diet currently but without the puree. Usually I only shit once a day and I can spend max amount of time at my keyboard.
---
More like WoW-Go-Away
---
I don't think this was about the hype. First the game was full of bugs. It was ridiculous.
---
I had never seen so many issues. 
---
The second major problem is the engine. That engine has no business being used in an mmorpg. 
---
Otherwise I would have played the shit out of this game.
---
Sad it was ridiculously fun. Imperial agent is my dream class as a rogue and healer fan. An energy based healer was my wet dream. 
---
Release of ICC patch making content absolute was the worst decision they could make but that doesnt take anything away from WotLK being a great expansion. 
---
Just like ZG and ”overpowered” Bloodvine sets doesnt take anything away Vanilla. 
---
I wish ICC would have more ”platues” just like AQ demanding NR gear and Naxx demanded FR gear. 
---
Id say Fury overall as you almost always have something to press, although theres not a whole lot of thinking outside of your threatmeter. 
---
Fury also comes with the bonus of being the best dps in patch 1.12 (the version we're getting) whereas Enhance can barely make it into raids without being there purely to be a totem twister for the people who did roll fury. Id say Fury has the disadvantage of everyone wanting your gear but enhance suffers from the same issues of the rogues/warriors wanting the same shinies. 
---
And if youre pvp'ing, well Arms is Arms and is amazing but so is windfury 1 shotting someone so thats a choice between consistency versus rng obscenity. 
---
It was, but Blizz said it was a bug/mistake and therefore it was taken out as soon as the players found out and started exploiting it by soloing Kazzak. So yes, it's ridiculous that on Private servers this still works. They run 1.12 client and it was taken out of the game by 1.5 If I remember correctly.  After that Reckoning only stacked 5 times and /sit would no longer procc on critt abilities. 
---
Nothing should change because they simple can NOT be trusted. They're selfish and greedy.
---
What im speeaking about specifically is blizzard has stated they want classic to exist forever
---
So you then have to think about these servers long term, not just on the initial patch progression.  If I go to play a wrath server and its already at the ICC patch the the only actual content is ICC heroics and ICC everything else is worthless. All new players who decide to play will only have ICC heroics and ICC
---
Even if we assume they do rolling  server resets everyone who joins after say TOC is going to miss half of the content in the game and then what....do they just wait for the next server restart in a year?
---
There is no way to make a wrath server actually work long term, it  was a garbage expansion
---
At work like :')
---
&gt;but are you seriously advocating just letting people go straight from fresh dinged 80 to ICC on a wrath server?
---
My main point was how bad those instances were. Probably not a good idea to cut 2/3 of the expansion's content even if it is bad, so I can't say I'm advocating that.
---
Naxx maybe you could argue was okay at best, for about a month, maybe two. But the 5 or so months it lasted really soured any positives I had to take from it.
---
WoW token will make classic pay to win. There has always been gold selling, but in this case, the answer is NOT liberalisation. Only response to pay to win is to cut your losses and exit fast.
---
Sharding beyond what they have claimed as of now is a game breaker. I will judge them harshly. 
---
Cash shop, ’cause there is nothing you can sell that will not ruin classic in some way, and this will also remove my confidence that any actiblizz game is worth investing time in.
---
Right-click reporting automute/bot game masters is a deal breaker, because it will be used and abused, and it will ruin the game. If I didn’t experience it myself it still would. The possibility of automute ruins the game for everybody - even the sorry opportunists who use it and benefit ik the short term. 
---
Death by a thousand cuts is the most likely cause if exit for me. There’s already quite a few cuts. I’d like to say that so far, every single change they have announced to classic is for the worst. This is not true - the graphics change is good! LOL as usual, graphics is the only thing they get right these days. 
---
Pretty much this. People want to kill other players more than capture flags or towers.
---
Inactive physical activity+Excess carbs=increased insulin release and fat storage.
---
Basically Soon™ then? It actually feels pretty nostalgic.
---
Oh well, this should feed 'content' creators for a few weeks.
---
Must be so easy being a WoW community manager. Don't have to communicate much. Don't have to use commas much either. Good stuff.
---
Just adding that if you pre-coat the fish in a fine layer of flour the egg mixture will stick to it better.
---
If you're running with a premade on Discord, you run as a pack. However, controlling mid in WSG is actually a good strategy in PUGs, as a decent rogue, druid, or anyone with rocket boots + FAP that escapes to mid will have a clear shot.
---
Yeah that is why i said a few hours. I dont enjoy the insanely long ones either, the ones with no end. 
---
I might have given that impression from what i wrote
---
Doesnt really nätter. A relatively big streamer will have a big following that will do everything to ruin the streamers experience, as a result other players on the same server will have to play with those retards.
---
An equally large problem is that AV is often really "Herbalism Valley." A lot of people zone in just to find the Lotus spawn, other end game herbs, and Thorium veins. They don't contribute to pvp at all.
---
More like $160
---
That’s some fantasy! Getting me all hot and bothered 
---
I think you could probably do it with engineering and maybe if you have the stun trinket.
---
Dude, what a story ! :)
---
Maybe stupid question but, can you please tell me how the kiter managed to maintain aggro?
---
basically just keybind everything near your movement keys, A,W,D. then reuse all the keys with shift ctrl also
---
How would anyone be upset by that? 
---
for example: Ravencrest 1,2 and 3 if you pick one of those realms and someone has taken the name "dabbington" on perhaps ravencrest 1.
---
If you then start on Ravencrest 2 and also try to take the name Dabbington, you cant since its allready taken on the "real" ravencrest server. and vice versa if someone had taken it on the Ravencrest 2 realm and you try to take it on ravencrest 1. 
---
Simple solution.
---
You gain very few rep if quest gray. 
---
July 16th.
---
Loot trading isn’t a necessary evil. They could simply refuse handling those issues.
---
It's not. If something is a rampant problem, first of all one should be exposed to it when in prime position to be, and not only hyper regularly. Also forums would have had complaints about it fairly often. Obviously I could be an outlier but then the forums issue still stands. It wasn't rampant, 100% sure. It did happen, 100% sure.
---
if you're good at your class, can make the raids consistently, and aren't a spaz you can find a raiding guild with any class. and the hunter pop at 60 in general is pretty deceiving. lots of people level a hunter solely for gold farming, and there's also lots of casuals/bads that play hunter just because it's easy to level with, and they're not competition when it comes to finding a guild.
---
are druids this bad guys ? cuz i've never palyed classic and wanted to lvlup a druid if it's that bad tell me please i don't wanna waste time lvling it
---
Just the merger. Not the names. I cant think of a solution for when the population dies down a bit. But ppl seem to not be a fan of mergers in the past.
---
Get yourself a mouse with button on it
---
They definitely nerfed using multiple trinkets at once sometime in vanilla. People would use ToEP and ZHC and just annihilate someone.
---
Haha I didnt even notice the giant sentance for the 2nd bit.
---
For classic to last forever they need to restart the servers after a cycle. There is no incentive to play if you already cleared the raids and just like on pservers, the old server dies if there is a fresh release. 
---
Its like people remember Vanilla thru some shimmering googles. Vanilla had alot of bis loot available in early patches, ZG being a catchup with blue items equal to MC epics, raids destroyed in less than 30 minutes if everyone had the tier sets from the raids and older raids puged only because they offered expensive mats and legendaries.
---
ICC patch was a casual patch that ruined progression but Wotlk was alot more than that. 
---
Perfect are 3 hunters in every raid. Tranq Shoot in rotation between 3 Hunters, because of cool-down.
---
The pro is you get fast equip. Cons, if you not skilled you got kicked.
---
So far I've informed my boss I'm taking a week 'in summer' an actual date would be nice
---
What about classicdb.ch?
---
They already said no to it, why pretend otherwise?
---
What's the point? May as well just shard early and remove it
---
I got a razer orbweaver to learn how to use keybinds, and even then bind left and right on the thumbstick to strafe to force you away from keyboard turning
---
The 4x4 grid I keybound to main abilities, left strip were bound to tab and shift, ctrl and a custom bind for my extra action button. I also used bartender to set up a shift scroll setting to change action bars. The thumb button was bound to my movement skill
---
I also use a logitech g105. Big thumb button is PTT, side thumbs are stun/taunt. Top finger buttons are dispel and racial or maybe pvp trinket. Click wheel left for mount (or stealth on rogue) and click right for flying mount.
---
All of those on the mouse had a shift click bound also 
---
Yeah I wish, but I don't believe it.
---
Yeah from the downvotes Im assuming people thought I meant that a beta isn't necessary, which is obviously not true.
---
I meant I'm personally not excited to play it.
---
Can't wait to play my troll druid
---
Holy shit, you're such a huge Blizzard fanboy it's not even funny.
---
&gt; What I fear is that, 9 months later, I go back to my lvl 60 toon and no guild wants to accept me (even if I can offer very decent performance and 100% assistance) because of gear. The worst scenario I imagined is: all guilds raiding BWL or AQ40 or whatever is up at that time, while I'm needing MC and Onyxia and nobody is willing to run those anymore, so I will never be able to catch up. But as you seem to say, that is extremely unlikely to happen, isn't it?
---
Not even unlikely, it won't happen 100%.
---
Hopefully it gets updating with correct info when Classic launches.
---
Its not credit based as much as it is "who do we give this to, for it to have the largest impact on the raid?". It just so happens that you get more impact out of putting your best gear on your best players.
---
I see why you think that, and it's probably because that's the stuff that's ready right now... Good to keep that opinion in mind though, and if you have suggestions DM me and I can pass it onto the team
---
Didn't know achivements were a thing back in classic LUL
---
They're a fun class to play, with a lot of versatility. Unfortunately, they're also one of the weakest overall classes in vanilla.
---
I knew it wasn’t just me! Dude my laptop is a potato already but when wowhead is up it’s unplayable
---
Pffft, it's a druid weapon. 
---
Soon as they got a res that wasn't on cooldown they were awesome. 
---
I'd be happier if basically all addons would be banned. However this isn't a dealbreaker issue for me.
---
Also if you have a competent DD you can sometimes rely on him being able to deal with the mob himself. A frost Mage can easily kite one elite. If your DDs are more than just DPS they might even save the healer by aggroing a lose mob on purpose, kite it, freeze it etc.
---
The problem is to find out whether your DDs are just brainless rotation guys or actually decent players.. 
---
Information is not fully accurate, a better source is vanillawowdb.com for the items that are currently in there, but it follows the current patch progression of a certain server so not all items are released yet.
---
But they are also the most infuriating to play again. If you get dunked on by a frost mage, you are: "whatever, they are OP anyways, not much I can about one if he has the opener"
---
But a druid keeps you on the edge making you think you can win while in fact you lost when his first insect swarm + moonfire was applied. 
---

It this real? Quite a blatant grammar mistake there for a community manager to make. 
---
But it is though. You were being hypocritical. I agree with everything else you said here though.
---
&gt;ralyzed on the left side of my body for 6 months. I was stuck in a hospital bed for that entire time. WoW was again my only escape.
---
did you roll hunter?   
---
glad you made it, cancer is fucking shit and should have humanities attention not 1000 wars in whatever bumfuck desert. 
---
Read it all the way through, thanks for sharing mate.
---
Oh yeah, because that site has less people promoting their shit compared to wowhead lmao. No thanks
---
Weak in raids yes. Not in any other content
---
Same, I’m just glad Classic is still being acknowledged. 
---
You roll a new character and start binding things as you get them. No clicking, never. 
---
Yeah there were race restrictions on mounts back in Vanilla that weren’t removed until earthy Wrath in Patch 3.0.8, nearly 5 years later. Only dwarves and gnomes could ride mechanostriders, etc. 
---
Hey, what about keyboards with macro buttons? Anyone using this?
---
 I have cheap x7 g800v but i think about buying something new. 
---
Flying mounts aren't just world pvp my dude. But you clearly don't know shit.
---
Hans ff dimmen.
---
Dark iron?
---
"Thinking of you"
---
Old Scarlet Monastery, Scholomance, Dire Maul, Deadmines, and Stratholme. 
---
Mergers were not good as it would remove you from you realm name/identity and would also cause alot of problems with who should have which name.
---
What I suggest wouldnt have either.
---
Tl;dr don't expect any news this month.
---
&gt;Numbers 1-**9**
---
That's some slenderman shit, dude.
---
&gt;vanillawowdb.com
---
True, I guess all of the sites need to adjust their data when classic launches..
---
Love your rare mob videos! had no idea some of these rares existed back then and had no idea this trinket existed either. I have to pick this up when Classic comes around. 
---
I love you both
---
If you're not worried about gearing and have good attendance then you'll find a spot in a raiding guild eventually. Just show that you're willing to put the effort in by getting some (if not all) prebis and consumes, then having a good attitude in raid when you get a chance!
---
Did they though?
---
Well, they're mid tier leveling, bad at farming anything but ore and herbs, and only good at flag carrying. Druids definitely get the short end of the stick in vanilla at level 60.
---
No I’m not, I don’t even play wow at the moment because it’s garbage 
---
Sharding confirmed!
---
Out of all the things I don’t want added to Classic, Dungeon Finder and a cash shop are the two biggest things. If those are in the game I may not end up rehabbing for it. 
---
Bind A D to strafe to free up Q and E, and then R and F are for your interrupts or other spells you need to get off fast. At least that's one good way of running it.
---
Well we were more of a casual guild on a quite succesful EU realm, he wanted to race for realm 1sts and stuff
---
To be fair we're not quite sure how the economy is going to look, because private servers are way more hardcore than future classic servers, and there are also way more players on a single server on private. That said farming did get more efficient, so I would bet lower than on sp but still maybe twice higher as it was during vanilla. 
---
To be fair, I dont really use any of the numbers ranging 7-9 for important shit. Only some random consumables, 30min CD abilities etc.
---
The quest to grab the masks take 2 to 3 run to complete unless you are the only one looting that tho.
---
The only way for about 90% of it is donating Runecloth to the faction of your choice: [Example](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=7837/additional-runecloth).  Yep, 20 Runecloth for 75 Reputation.  It's as stupid as it sounds, but it was actually rather fitting for the pre-WoW age of MMORPGs if not actually a little less of a grind than most other grinds in MMORPGs before WoW.
---
The general lack of punctuation does it for me.
---
Bloodsail is all the Steamwheedle cartel, so Gatgetzan as well.
---
When I was a 15 year old kid I did the wotlk expansion with 5 classmates. One of them was like "yo open that drawer for me." He took out actual coke and took a hit then and there. I'm still shocked about it.
---
Be a man fo Clives!
---
One WOTLK pvp private server ran for years and was super popular. I have not seen any similar servers like that for TBC. 
---
Get Hurricane bow.  Spec MM.  Job done.

There is a guy who posted the database of classic.

If you know how to use mysql, you could probably list all loots from all mobs of a specific dungeon zone.

Hi, /u/Nagawolfwoodop
---
I suggest classic wowhead:
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/molten-core](https://classic.wowhead.com/molten-core)
---
How are they mid tier leveling? They are definetly top tier after lock and hunter. They have the the highest skill ceiling only comparable to hunters for pvp with enormous amount of tools to outplay an enemy in pvp. They have the most mana efficent downgraded heal. Highest threat generation in vanilla. High dps in cat form and an aura giving stats that equals 120ish dps. They are not only good at flag carrying they are the best at flag carrying. They have stealth. You just lack imagination or experience to claim druids are bad just cuz their numbers can seem very low in a raid setting
---
Mok's post is actually the most important one.  It all hinges on the Eye of Sulfuras itself dropping at all, and when it does it's all going to bank on basically saying, "*I* will be the crazy bastard that gets all the insane materials needed for the Sulfuron Hammer so we can actually use this Eye!" and people actually believing you enough.  Or maybe you'll find a guild that simply doesn't give a shit and hands it over because the materials are so demanding, lol.
---
Do whatever is comfortable for you. I see people here saying how you should do this or that, but in the end, their preferences may be completely different from yours.
---
For example, I wouldn´t be able to use Q, E, R, A or any other things other people suggested (And pressing buttons with pinky? What is this madness, that´s not possible, that finger sucks ass!) and I am certain people would give me weird look if I told them I use F1 - F4 (and Shift+F1 - F4) for upper row of my keybinds, but because I play on laptop, my keyboard is smaller and therefore using those buttons is pretty easy and something natural for me.
---
Although, one great advice people gave here was keeping things consistent between characters. When they have comparable spells, for example AoE, big cooldown spell, movement ability, CC, put them on the same hotkey, so you will subconsciously know what to press without looking.
---
This! I'd like to know so I can play my summer holidays accordingly.
---
in AB you get rep (forgot how much) every X tickets (something like every 200ish) your team gets. You get additional rep for being in the BG when it ends, more if you win. 
---
Thus if you lose like 0/2000 you only get the rep you get from "completing" the BG.
---
As for the quest where you have to cap 4 bases: That one was obtainable every 10 levels, I cant recall it being repeatable though.
---
Furthermore Winning gives 3 marks of honor, losing gives one. You can turn in those for extra rep
---
I dont get this ”epics is hard and earned” in Vanilla. Where exactly? MC, Onyxia and ZG is pugable with randoms and BWL is also pugable as long as the tanks are alts and have proper gear. 
---
There you go, ”free purple” for healers and dps. 
---
The reason why he thinks that is because that's all it is. The moment you open your webpage, youtube and twitch are front and centre. The entire background animates. Scrolling down reaches a list of promises that resemble a failed startup company, and scrolling down further shows a bunch of streamers, and I guess forum moderators?
---
What people use wowhead for is an easy to navigate database. What have you done to be better than wowhead? Looking at your top bar, the only thing that could be considered useful is the character tool, but that pulls information from *a different database entirely*. One of the prime complaints of the comment you originally replied to was tons of stupid videos grabbing your attention. How is your website any different? Do you really think people go to wowhead for daily vlogs and streamer cred?
---
If you want to be a good alternative to wowhead, what you need is a simple database with an easy to use search function, some comments, *maybe* a forum. Your front page should just be your logo and a search bar. I shouldn't see a huge grid of usernames with pictures. How many people actually know, or care, about the people currently managing wowhead? I shouldn't have to turn on seven scripts just to view the page properly. And viewing the page properly shouldn't mean an *animated background*.
---
This isn't a useful tool to the community like wowhead once was. This is another social network that'll *totally be better than that other one, just you wait and see!*
---
You can block them with uBlock Origin by using the element picker and clicking on the banners/videos in order to filter them.
---
But fuck having to log in, though. That'll make me pass hard on wowhead as a whole, especially seeing as less obnoxious alternatives such as classicdb or vanillawowdb exist who probably will update when classic launches.
---
How exactly? 
---
Ulduar and ICC is among the best raids ever with the best villain. Sounds like you didnt progressed thru the content. 
---
Amen, brother.
---
You literally just suggested sharding to prevent sharding. lmao
---
There is no rotation, lock in pvp is about control and staying alive.
---
Your best defensive spells are: coil &gt; Fear &gt; health stone &gt; shadow ward (when against other locks and spriest) &gt; sacrivice voidwalker (if out) &gt; spell stone (against casters apart from shamans), also there is soul link but that should be up at all times if specced into it
---
Best offensive spells: Corruption, curse of agony, siphon life (if affliction), immolation + conflagrate if destruction specced, (shadowbolt + CoS if you have succubus out), spell lock if felhound is out, searing pain (1.5 cast time is more reliable than shadow bolt)
---
Pets:
---
Felhound (against any casters and mages in particular), VoidWalker (against melee, except shaman), succubus for the control in 1v1 scenarios
---
Honestly, this feels like a very likely date to me even if you were just making something up in 5 seconds for fun.
---
[It's real.](https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1104994-surprised-we-have-not-had-any-news/) He often posts like this to "blend in" with the kids or something.
---
Not a real suggestion for a change or anything like that, but I really will miss playing my DK. Not having many options for plate dps is sad.
---
You are sure to be handed it if you roll a druid.
---
I'm confused you say Siphon Life as a spec, then mention Ruin as another spec. But the number 1 pvp for org pvp was SM/Ruin which included both of those things lol
---
Honestly, if you wanting to do end game content/raiding I would personally suggest going mage instead. Above all else, most raids only take around 3 hunters and later on hunter DPS falls off really bad because pets don't scale properly. On the other had a mage doesn't suffer the same issues and is usually picked over a hunter in raids and instances.
---
Sure it is. Just get to level 40, find the best grinding spot where you won't gain experience, and buy cloth off the auction house for the rep turn ins (when they appear).  Sure it will take way longer than leveling to 60 and getting rep that way (like years), but you will eventually get there.
---
(I do not endorse this plan of action)
---
My keybinds are kinda weird, but the main ideia is that you find some good keys that you con confortably hit, and then use similar keybinds for simillar effects on everyone of you chars, so you get used to it.
---
Some examples: "X, C, V" (with shift moifiers when needed) are always my main DPS skills. No matter the class, the DPS skills will be there and I'll always know it.
---
"B" will always be my stun (Bash, Cheap/Kidney Shot, HoJ)
---
"1" is always a movement skill (dash, charge, sprint) and "2, 3 and 4" are mostly heal skills (self heals or things like Evasion/Disarm when playing on pure DPS)
---
"5" is always my CC skill. So Polymorph, Fear, Blind etc..
---
"R" is always my interrupt skill. So Spell Lock, Counterspell, Kick, Pummel, Earth Shock Rank 1, Feral Charge etc will always be here
---
"G" is my dispell. Remove Curse, Dispell, Cleanse etc...
---
"H" is my racial. "Shift+H" and "Ctrl+H" are my trinkets.
---
This is getting to long. I have more keybinds (E, Q, 6, N) that are similar skills between classes too. You got the point. Now it's only a matter of finding good keys :)
---
IMO if you don't have a lot of time and want to raid at a higher level ... choose something that doesn't require too many consumables as long as you still enjoy the class.  Shadow priest would likely need flask for spell dmg and warriors will need titans.  Normal healers are a bit better because you really don't need to flask as the stats won't help you.  You do need consumables (mana oils, food buff, mana pots/runes, etc) but you will likely get away with using less because when you are on farm content you don't have to use mana pots/oils etc because you can easily heal without them allowing you to conserve them for when you do.  DPS will still need to consumable/flask on farm content because it will generate a quicker clear time (tanks might not need to but are the most time-heavy investment role-wise overall).
---
In general I think healers are probably the least consumable heavy because the only real resource you need is mana most of the time as most consumables do not give +healing and only a few give spirit(which is negligible almost).
---
Strongly depends on spec and if how seriously you are taking it, for premades the default spec is SM/Ruin. In WSG  and AB as SM/Ruin your job is to fight with the main fighting force and tongues every healer/hard casting enemy with priority on healers, throw corruption on everything that isn't getting polyied,  use pet silence on key heals/CC casts, use DC and fear to peel healers. If none of that needs doing then you can throw siphon/immolate or if the leader is calling for burst drop previous priorities and shadowbolt the target called (while still disrupting healers). In WSG you are usually one of the first called back for defense because of your peel options. (although I have played with groups that prefer you on flag retrieval) On AB weekends you MIGHT get to play SL. 7/31/11 + 2 and then you just act as a boat anchor on a flag until help can arrive.
---
What to take, jewelry or inscription?
---
While they should take all the time they need to polish, I don't understand why communication is bad. They have enough people to write some wall of text every week. And for fans it would be very engaging.
---
I use wowhead a lot, but the slow down happening because of adds is too much. However, the price for removing adds and supporting wowhead is very low, and that's the route I will take in classic.

Sorry to reply so late, I stumbled upon this post after googling for the same thing.
---
Is it the one that was in black and white, starring a mustached human male in tuxedo and a hat? Featuring the band members from L70ETC (I guess they're just called Elite Tauren Chieftain now). I think there was a druid form tree dancing as well?
---
I have a strong feeling that those expansions are very different and attract different people. Vanilla is RPG and farm. TBC is more about skill and some QoL features, it's very different from vanilla. WotLK is all about accessibility. I'm sure that many people who are playing TBC or WotLK on private servers won't stick with classic. So while there will be some player base split, it won't be that bad.
---
I move my hand to the right side of the keyboard.
---
Instead of WASD, thumb hitting space only and pinky hitting modifiers shift, alt, ctrl only, I play on OKL; with thumb on modifiers. Pinky hits space, comfortably hits TYUDFGHCVBN....
---
It takes a day or two to get used to, but it opens up a ridiculous number of keys/keybind potentials while keeping your fingers on the movement keys.
---
While I enjoyed Cata myself, I don't think that many people did. So if anything, they would stop at WotLK. And from Pandaria it's pretty much retail WoW which does not need to be recreated.
---
I forgot they didn't have that at first
---
It's like right next to IF, which was the only auction house at release. It was literally the closest and easiest dungeon to get to.
---
I have seen a warrior guide that preached staves + spirit and had a few of the strangely high dps staves as BIS for leveling.
---
That might be true, but the concept of Early Access is terrible and shouldn't exist in the way it does.  
---
While 2-5 games may have succeeded, 25 have ripped you off.
---
Take all of the useful advice in this thread and implement it into your gameplay from level 1. The more time you spend practicing these new binds while leveling, the more natural they will feel. If you wait till 60 then try to bind everything, you may get overwhelmed. Leveling is especially good because you learn skills every few levels, so you get use to each abilities keybind bit by bit. If you don’t like a certain bind for an ability, you can always change it. 
---
Any new character I make, the first thing I usually do is immediately fill my entire bottom action bars with key binds I’m used to, whether or not I have the ability yet. Then just drag and drop each new skill you learn and start feeling it out. Best of luck mate
---
From person experience, I used auctioneer and gatherer, necrosis, and a few others, maybe you didn't know addons were a thing but many of us did.
---
Read the other similar posts
---
Yup, that what I was thinking. Make new servers with BC and let people port their characters over if they want. But no backsies. Keep servers with classic for those who only want classic. And for people that wanna play BC make new servers. Simple solution. Don't know about the cost though. 
---
I remember on a private server one nolife guild got scarab lord for their guild bank. Talk about status symbols.
---
So for leveling I would say enhancement shaman is more fun/engaging.  Shaman leveling in general is a pretty good experience and warrior is bottom tier for fun usually.
---
For raiding enhancement shaman is pretty much there for Nightfall or because you are in a casual guild.  Fury warrior is good for raids since apparently 1.12 is their flavor of the month patch back in vanilla where they were good.  Arms is what most of our offtanks used in vanilla but I think fury took over in patch 1.12 (probably even a bit earlier).
---
For PvP its arms warrior especially with raid gear.  Enhancement shaman/fury warrior can also be cool with big crits/dmg etc but arms is always the better choice especially with a pocket healer.
---
Everything will taste like rubber for a week!
---
I played one in Vanilla and the best compliment I could hope for was,  "He heals like a priest!". It's definitely hard mode but it can be very rewarding when your hard work pays off. 
---
Just uh... don't plan on be invited to groups unless you're restoration...
---
"Perfect" = the form they find acceptable at launch, with no major bugs which they don't want in the game. The extra "features" like sharding are already decided I am afraid and they will roll with them regardless. 
---
For hardcore players, I find the beta release quite useful, they'll know what to expect - they'll decide at the end of the beta if it's okay for them to give WoW Classic a chance or not (depending on how Blizzard will respond to their concerns).
---
So yea, I understand your point of view, hopefully I've made myself also understood. 
---
Salutations :)
---
Your best bet by far is to keep your eyes open around the time open beta starts(or a bit earlier) and guilds start recruiting in earnest.  There will almost certainly be a couple of guilds that raid weekend only and are serious due to the leadership being in a similar situation as you are.  The alternative is if there are server transfers to find that kind of guild later and transfer.  I have been in a couple of guilds that raided only 2-3 days a week are were comparable(world rankings ~90ish-180 throughout TBC) to guilds that raided 4-5 days instead and for longer hours.
---
They are rare but you just have to find that serious like minded group that is hardcore mentality but lightcore schedule.
---
Stop fucking posting this.
---
Also classic the BC is paradoxical
---
**awesome**
---
I am glad you also made it through your trail, Shadowguy and found people too. See you this summer in Azeroth. Writing it all down was a relief for me and helped me sort out my thoughts. Feedback from the nice folks like you here felt good.
---
Dude, it's not news. You weren't right.
---
Zzz hope it flops hard. Shit taking them way too long. They've been sitting on a goldmine for years but instead they're too busy focusing on life support for their other dying/dead games.
---
I do appreciate the effort Wowhead has gone through, but I really enjoy my websites with darker theme. Reddit, YouTube both have dark modes enabled for me and I hope I can do the same with that site too.
---
Or " You think we're gonna announce something, but we don't."
---
But you have not earned the item until you won it (by rolling, dkp, LC what ever). Therefore No. 9 is imo not appliable. 
---
Ain't gonna lie I was a bit dissapointed in Ice Barrier as final talent as frost mage.
---
Have you ever played classic?
---
I'm more of an herb person when I play.
---
bro all i played the last 5 years was vanilla but when i think about official wotlk 3.0-3.1 i jizz repeatedly until i lose consciousness. it's entirely different but an amazing game, at least for those two patches. 
---
Pure classes will be over saturated like on pservers. Warrior rogue mage priest.
---
As per, everyone will be play dps.
---
The coming future eh? As opposed to the previous future?
---
I like to engineer my own chemical conpounds.
---
During vanilla/tbc I worked nights and was able to play then. I always thought it was dark out. Ha.
---
Don't let it stop you! Play a hunter since you seem to like them and be the best dang hunter you can be :3
---
How can you say mages are harder than druids or hunters? They have such simple mechanics and a lot of oh shit buttons that others simply dont have. Not talking about the absurd amount of cc they have to further simplify the class
---
My priest told me you will most likely be able to play vanilla in heaven so at least there's that.
---
Taking flying out of TBC would also be quite good. 
---
Thanks for sharing man. Hoping to meet some good pals in Classic as well!
---
Made a comment on that guys jungle looking desk setup, saying it would work for trolls or maybe even tauren druids. Everyone and their mother thought I meant troll druids and downvoted me but I never said troll druids. People just rush to assumptions on this sub.
---
I spent more of my life waiting for Diablo III to be released than I actually spent playing Diablo III.
---
Well it also depends if AB is always running or only during special weekends
---
I seem to remember there being brewfest in vanilla. 
---
Free pally horse was such a game changer. Really helped cure the burnout I was feeling. 
---
I know Wrath gets a bad rap and in a lot of ways it does seem to be the point they went over the edge a bit. The raid boss design was great however and some of the class design (Enh shaman especially) was top notch. Be nice to have it.
---
In Nagrand.

---
There you go, buddy.
---
I don't think splitting the player base will be as big an issue. As long as you have a populated server in WoW you can play. I think vanilla -&gt; Wrath would be big enough for each of them to have at least a few populate servers.
---
World of Warcraft Classic will be based 100% on mobile devices!
---
Don't you have phones?
---
Yessir 
---
Oh I'm just talking about leveling, not difficulty. My comment wasn't clear. It's true. 
---
I’m playing dps since I don’t have the time I did back in the day to level and be a priest main again
---
Like I said, March/April for a new major announcement which will include the actual release date. I'm still praying that they won't do anything counterproductive to classic WoW.. every day.
---
1.10 was the weather patch. (1.11 was naxxramas)  I remember this because Blizzard boasted a unique weather system before launch and it wasn't implemented for what seemed forever.  I know this is /s but I kinda feel like weather shouldn't be at launch like real classic.
---
"as well as things we want to communicate to you guys about classic"
---
so they made a message about how they are making a message?
---
horde warriors use 2h in raids...
---
Hunters are one of the most popular classes in the game but most raids will only use a few.
---
&gt;	They have enough people to write some wall of text every week. 
---
That mindset kind of bugs me. I know they have a lot of people, but from what I understand all those people have lots to do. I’d rather they just chill and talk to us when they’re ready rather than constantly try to find new, unsubstantial things to talk about.
---
Besides, constantly finding new, unsubstantial things to talk about is *our* expertise here at /r/classicwow
---
It depends on what you consider bad. Some people love the play style. If you want to top the damage or healing meters (or be a viable main tank for your raid group), your best bet is to find another class.
---
I enjoy the versatility and ability to improve the chances of success for the entire group. The things that do not show up on the meters.
---
nf/conflag is the best
---
the simple combo of shadowbolt, immolate, and conflag is very effective in BGs.  the shadowbolt has a travel time from you to the target so it should land around the same time as your immolate/conflag.  its a lot of burst damage and will kill people before their healer can react 
---
Raids have a better chance at success when there are a few players looking out for the success of the whole group. In this role, Druids are one of the best. If you want to min-max classes with the most raw damage or healing output, then there are other classes that are better.
---
So you want to hard-shard players to prevent soft-sharding of players? I don't see any benefit at all only downsides. 
---
I wasnt worried about it before, but now I kinda am.
---
Go for Feral Druid, you can play the Rogue 99% of the time, and when you lack a tank for an instance you can just say, alright I'll Bear Tank this shit.
---
I have always heard 5% tanks, 15% healers and 80% dps. So that will most likely be the case in vanilla aswell, there's a risk that even less people will play as tanks though since it takes a lot of time and dedication which fewer older people have nowadays and I doubt big time that new people will even consider tanking over playing rogue, mage or a hunter.
---
Your best option is to have a buddy who plays tank, now that's luxury.
---
That moonwell in Stormwind brings back memories. A friend used to call it “the night elves’ public toilets”.
---
You have an absurdly low bar for news then.  When you read the paper and here the sun will come out do you fall out of your chair? 
---
Hurricane bow? Yuck! Carapace Spine Crossbow or Blackcrow are both leagues better for raid dps.
---
On the realm I played it was rampant though. Every ICC pre-made or pug had groups of friends who would need for each other. The most common item this happened for being the trinket from saurfang. 
---
I had to do it myself or I would have never gotten it.
---
Dude. That screenshot of you guys sitting around the campfire and talking - that’s exactly what Classic is about. This is awesome. 
---
There was a poll recently (last couple months) on this subreddit that asked this very question.  It turned out \~60% said they would play DPS.  \~25% tank and \~15% healer.
---
Weed is a ped for pro gaming scene, no bs. For myself it makes me focused in league of legends, my current game until classic is out.
---
They can also first just release content they planned on releasing before. Like Karazan was supposed to be a Vanilla Raid/Dungeon. Hence the reason why it's in DW Pass.
---
I think those are useless today, you wouldn't be able to install BfA using those disks 
---
0 chance that there will be more tanks than healers.
---
40% tank refusing warriors, 35% rogues, 15% mages, 10% for the rest 
---
LOL. Imagine playing a druid unironically. 
---
This.
---
The nerd screams at the end! Love it.
---
Also a tank  randomly walking past you in the middle of the fight lol.
---
Priest is really fast levelling with want spec and spirit tap but ok lol
---
Yes you need to roll a fury warrior if you want to raid 
---
Scuffed rogue
---
It’s confirmed July 16th.

No, community managers don't have a lot to do. They have exactly this work: to communicate things to us. Sure, developers will need to spend few minutes a week to talk about something. But may be they would like it themselves? It's not like you can write a code 8 hours every day like a robot. There are meetings, there are progress reports.
---
I always like Factorio game developers. Check out their blog. They write interesting stuff literally every week and I enjoy reading it. That's my bar for communication. If small indie company can do it, Blizzard can do it as well.
---
Are you some sort of a magician? It started in 2008
---
That is some dedication, at least he'll be set for the max duration the game will last before blizz ruins it  
---
You seem fun at parties.  Let people enjoy things, mmkay?  You even agree with the dude, so why are you acting like an asshole?
---
Tank percentage will probably hover around 5% pure tanks with an extra 5-10% of total warriors with tanking offset pieces/capabilities. You can always factor in feral tanks as well
---
There is quite a lot of room for variation. 
---
Usually there are 2-4 tanks, 8-12 healers and the rest are DPS. 
---
I would not really overthink this matter, since it depends on many factors like classes (for example, you normally don't want as many druids as paladins), but it is a self-balancing system on a larger scale up to some point, because druids are traditionally the least popular class so it evens out the low demand.
---
Therefore I would suggest to consider roles and classes in tandem.
---
Oh I know, just saying that's what the poll stated.  But what people SAY they will do and what they ACTUALLY do are often two different things.
---
I feel like every Tauren that saw you on that mount would be obligated to engage you in combat to defend the honor of his people.
---
No! Just no...
---
I am going to second Vermintide 2 as well. If you, reader, have not checked it out you owe it to yourself to play it.  Plus Vermintide 2 is currently part of the humble monthly bundle, get it and 5 other games for $12.
---
I am in no way compensated for pushing this game, I simply love it. Think L4D2 but set in Warhammer, it has me happily addicted as i wait for classic. 
---
That was my first semi-serious raiding. I know what you're talking about. Ulduar was seriously awesome. But my problem is: it did not last long enough and there's no way I would experience firefighter with my raiding schedule, I'm not hardcore enough. And then ToC comes trivializing everything and turning game into toc 10 toc 10 heroic toc 25 farm with some toc 25 heroic progression, that was the real downfall of WoW for me.
---
So yeah, I would love wotlk if it stopped exactly when I need and stay there long enough so I could progress and wipe and kill bosses. But it won't and the story will repeat itself, easy nax, awesome but short ulduar, boring ToC and farming ICC for the rest of my life. I could even play that, LoL, WotLK holy paladin was the best healer in the game for all times for me and I could play it forever, I guess, I didn't build valanyr back in time. But vanilla sounds better. We will see.
---
Just play around with it and refuse to click spells unless they are non essential to combat, like conjure water/food teleport etc....
---
I have about 48 key binds.
---
I would say I can comfortably reach 24 of them with ease and quickness. The other 24 binds are non-essential to combat that I either hotkey or mouse click depending on my reaction.
---
F1-F12

\` 1 2 3 .... =

QERTYUIGHVF - Shift + QERTF
---
Side Mouse buttons and middle mouse...
---
normally if something has a longer cool down i may place it further out of my reach since I will probably use it when off CD but won't be pounding it because of CD (fireblast)
---
Frost Nova has always been 1 for me... i think of it as the starter for which everything else flows.
---
middle mouse is usually my interupt
---
q is usually CC
---
E R T Y usually some kind of defensive depends on the character \[R (ice block) \] GHV potions/healthstones --- Shift R Shift T usually racials and mouse side buttons typically end up being trinkets or on use items.

All of this was built by preference of never being a clicker and doing lots of pvp and dueling.

My SO and I have diet restrictions, so we have to follow a paleo diet (for the most part), but after switching I feel so much better that I wouldn't want to go back (and probably couldn't at this point). Now, I'm bringing this up because when you have diet restrictions you have to be creative in what you make because a lot of dishes revolve around bread and things of that nature. But, here's what I'm planning on so far.

Pizza Frittatas: 2 dozen eggs, pepperonis, pizza sauce, Italian blend cheese, garlic seasonings, herb de provence, salt, and pepper (I cut up the pepperonis, mix everything together and then pour the mix into 2 muffin pans that hold 12 muffins each, bake at 200 degrees F for ~15 minutes and done). 
---
Latin American frittats: cumin, salt, pepper, a dash of cayenne, bell peppers, mushrooms (bean substitute), 2 dozen eggs. Again, cut up the peppers and mushrooms, mix it all together, pour it into a the muffin pans and bake at 200 for 15 min. 
---
Those and a side (still thinking what to have with the pizza frittatas, while not a topping I'm going to put guac on the Latin American style ones and that'll fill us up till lunch), but that will hold us over for quite some time. 
---
For lunch I'm going to get some frozen meals. Walmart of all places has these microwavable  paleo meals that are surprisingly good, but they only make 3 varieties so that's going to be good for 3 maybe 6 says max. Growing up though my mom used to get me those [beef and bean](https://www.foodservicedirect.com/ruiz-foodservice-beef-and-bean-burrito-4-ounce-8-per-pack-8-packs-per-case-206189.html?gclid=CjwKCAiAy-_iBRAaEiwAYhSlAw-QjzUAoBh8v_55Ar0QoWZzcvTDMHTtgRBD6bLSAIwp9ial1aWishoCKIgQAvD_BwE) burritos in bulk and I would mow down on those when I played since they were easy to make and eat while playing. I'm going to try and re-create them. I'm thinking of taking some beef, seasoning it to make taco beef and then taking some potatoes and boiling them until they're extremely mashable, mixing them with some cut up mushrooms and seasoning the hell out of them. I think with those 2 things I can make the consistency of refried beans, then mix it with the beef, wrap in the burrito then freeze it. 
---
I like the idea of the crock pot though, maybe get a whole chicken and/or roast with some broth, add vegetables and just walk away from it until we get hungry. It's quick, easy and could make some fantastic meals. 
---
We also plan to order some pizza (Domino's has a really good gluten free option, and I love their wings for some reason), and maybe some Chinese food which'll last us a couple of days. 
---
Now, where I'm getting stuck is what kind of drinks to I want to have. I'm a scotch and beer drinker primarily, but I could try to make what I think [vanilla wow's drinks](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Drink) would taste like (scroll to the bottom for alcohol).  
---
I play WSAD like I type. I have always used my ring finger (next to the pinky) on the W. Almost all my friends play with their middle finger on the W. For that reason I find it easy for my pinky to hit the Q and \~ and 1 and I can stretch my pointer finger out down the keyboard down to the 7 Y U I  keys pretty easily but I normally don't use any Alt and CTRL cuz my pinky won't stretch that far down comfortably . So I always have to change key binds for shooters for my duck and prone are usually V and C.
---
It is interesting to me I have never heard of someone moving the keys over to SDFE but it makes sense to me since it accomplishes the same thing.
---
Considering how many inconsistencies were found during the 7-day trial they better release a massive and and extremely long beta phase soon if they expect to catch bugs before launch.
---
makes sense, I had always used my ring finger for WSAD ( because of typing)  - like you say home row and I find it easy to reach qaz and as far out as 7... but CTRL and ALT are a btch to hit for me.
---
I have no idea who he is, and I have no reason to believe he would lie.
---
Therefore, he is a ***credible anonymous source***.
---
Our guild has been recruiting in preparation for Classic, so far we have plenty of warriors, a healthy supply of priests, and then some mages.  Lacking overall in DPS which I think we will be able to recruit pretty quickly.
---
There were name change and server transfers.
---
I'm curious as to why shamans and pallies typically get priority over warrior.
---
DBM:   You generally weren't allowed in raids unless you had BigWigs or CT_raidassist installed if you were in a progression guild.      
---
NPC_Scan: is a non-issue, it alerts the player based on the vignettes(or whatever it's called, the stars on the minimap in retail)      
---
It used to scan for names popping up in the cache but that was broken by blizzard so they scanned for the star-things instead and since those most likely won't be in Classic, we're fine.        
---
Gatherer: I personally had a map open constantly in a tab with nodes/treasure locations.      
---
With multiple monitors being more common nowadays, it's not really gonna matter if it's allowed or not.
---
You get rezzed at the SH which is closest to your corpse, regardless of which one you are talking to. This prevents traveling via ghost form.
---
I suspect numbers in any poll on this forum will be skewed from the simple fact that tanks tend to be more enthusiastic players, hardcore and thus more likely to follow different subreddits and communities and thus also be more likely to answer any polls.
---
DPS is often more laidback casual players.
---
Of all the addons that exist, you think DPS-meters are a good thing. Nothing like having a social experience in a dungeon when one asshat thinks flaming someone for (as perceived by them) poor DPS is called for, even though the run is a success.
---
And yes, I know they existed back in the day. But back in the day, people were not rushing as much as they are now.
---
Still, if you think DPS-meters are a *good thing* then you can just as well stop complaining about the rest. Nothing except gearscore has the potential to be more toxic than a moron spamming DPS-leaderboards in a dungeon.
---
Sorry. It's just tiring seeing the same questions a thousand times. (I know, that's Reddit for you. :P)
---
Boost lowbies through deadmines and SFK, start a guild called "Bluetackmans Fan Club". 
---
I always sigh when i see a warrior spamming for a groupspot in LFG chat as DPS. Dude just throw on a damn shield and you get a group instantly as a tank.
---
I'd help all the new dudes level and gear then farm gold so I can buy mounts for people 
---
Same, DPS is going to be easy to recruit so we made sure to have people be willing to play tank and healer, if only temporairly, to help speed up getting started. That being said, simply having a large pool of players very early should be helpfull enough. 
---
Delete my char and start at level 1. I play for the leveling exp.
---
[25% tanks](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/meme/images/1/1d/Yt655563971_a663674241_z.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150712012656)
---
I mean, in their defense, they very much are a startup company, and their database hasn't been created yet. The actual time for competition between databases won't be until at least the beta so they can just do whatever grabs the most attention until then.
---
Your new character is created as level 60 with full gear. You are cursed by the GM's and unable to create a level 1 character - what do you do?
---
For classic being max lvl is boring. The real game in classic is the grind.
---
"We are still working on it. Good progress is being made, but it's still got a ways to go." That's what the post would look like literally every week. I'd rather have them say nothing. 
---
Would be pretty amazing. I guess I'd start farming gold for my mount and start working on professions and weapon skills. I wouldn't go so low to slaughter the low levels lol.
---
I don’t disagree with you on that, however if a person is raidlogging with their guild they don’t really form part of the wider aspect of the community for a given server. Just because they raid log on a vanilla server and again on a tbc server doesn’t mean that without the tbc option they’d automatically spend more time on vanilla. 
---
Player base therefore not split in the way I think you mean, but still only active in a certain way and for limited hours.
---
They can't be trusted to change anything. There's a reason we must for 15 years old wow, beyond nostalgia.
---
Start farming gold or rep.
---
Because a fast lose is more honor/h than long turtle games that prob leads to a lose anyway. On private servers you recognize the other team player names and know who is good etc. If you see that the other team is stacked while your team is full of scrubs there is no point in trying because it is already a lose, even if some people don't realize it.
---
Also specially for tbc etc where there are arena. battleground is just something you do to gear up for arenas. So you wanna be done with it quick so you can move on to the fun part i.e arenas. If you are not running a premade, battlegrounds are completely pointless since whatever you do don't affect the outcome of the game.
---
If you eat well all the time you may as well hit the shit hard for Classic. Red Bull, Pepsi, anything cooked in the oven/microwave for a couple weeks for me ;P
---
Best fan made song ever.
---
Shhh... us priests want increased demand.
---
I think ChargedUp07 was trying to explain why the protein diet might be working for op, since he wasn't having as many carbs.
---
As always 15% tanks 25% healers 65% dps
---
Hi, /u/justsomespecial
---
I have never been so happy about no-news news
---
"Want news? You think you do, but you don't."
---
Actually the only news we need are release dates 
---
Idk, for most players I'd say priest is a pretty slow leveler, simply due to the fact that after playing it for a few hours, you'll want to gouge out your eyes out of boredom...
---
Half these comments are "I just want a release date". Ah yes the Mount and Blade: Banner Lord Syndrome.
---
What an unusual combo!
---
I don't know what you said here to trigger 200+ replies from a bot having a stroke, but bravo!!
---
Oh, wait. Your poor Inbox ....
---
I absolutely agree. Being super exclusive and playing a class that doesn't even exist sounds really cool. However it's just not worth it, being a druid is just too good.
---
NEVER GIVE UP! PROTECT EVERYTHING! It'll be 2003 again and you'll be young and safe again! Everything will be all right. Shh. Shh. We just have to make sure they don't implement weather at release.
---
All warlock and hinter pet abilities arent on gcd iirc
---
Agreed, the critique was a little harsh, but there are a lot of elements I agree with in what people want in a database.
---
I'm planning on running a Tauren Prot Warrior, and my friends, role-wise, are as follows:
---
- DPS
---
- Healer/DPS
---
- Tank/DPS
---
I think it will be pretty close to what happens in pservers honestly. However, I'd expect the first few weeks to be really weird as people get on to try their mains from Retail out.
---
I just bought a Naga Trinity. I plan on having my two right action bars loaded to 1-9, 0 + - and then have a shift modifier for the 2nd right action bar. I keep middle mouse for autorun. 
---
Can you tell I play a shaman LOL
---
I want this. But I can't have it and that's fine. You can't get everything in vanilla. Makes for more interesting choices.
---
I know what u/Angwe would do ;)
---
Do you mean his post's title? Probably because he's treating it like a title you would find on a book or movie.
---
That was patch 1.10.
---
The only thing they're supposed to announce is that they're done and the release date. 
---
I guess capacity and balance is the problem. It's 40v40. So if you join up with a group of 5 there has to be space in that AV for 5 peepz. And rarely there was. 1 or 2 spots sure. but 5 was a huge difference. if AV would play 40v35 the side with the bigger number had a huge advantage. 
---
Also a 40man pre-made queuing up for AV would always be dropped in an empty AV. Which meant 40 man should be find to join the queue on the other side as well. Which is a lot. 
---
What they could do is only pre-made VS - pre-made So when you queue up with a raid of 40 man. You can only be pinned against another pre-made of 40 man.
---
That's a tough question.  I actually love to play tanks, but don't really enjoy the warrior class.  (I tried to level up a warrior during retail vanilla, I don't think I got beyond level 44.)  I've main tanked raiding in two other games (Dwarf Guardian in LOTOR: Shadows of Angmar launch, and Sith Juggernaut in SWTOR Launch + ROTHC expansion)
---
During TBC retail I started playing a Blood Elf Protadin and enjoyed it immensely, but I can't do that now for two reasons:  I don't really want to play alliance and Protection spec during vanilla was pretty crappy.  Even with BiS protection style gear, the most you could expect would be to tank 5 mans.  
---
So long story short: I'd like to play a tank, but don't really think warrior is the class for me.  I've considered feral tanking but from what I've read that's pretty much non-existant outside of the occassional off-tank situation or 5-man dungeon as well: but at least playing a feral druid I could stay horde...so there's that.
---
I'll probably end up rolling a shaman, was my favorite class back then.
---
Yeah that doesn't make any sense, all those displaced ally locks go mage, horde has limited cleanse options so your roots/slows stick. Mage is weak to lock, and there are lots of horde locks but o
---
Paladin cleanses more than make up for it
---
Yeah, you're exactly blizzactivisions target demographic these days.
---
Eh, I’m still partial to the idea of the answer being “Around July 2nd because FF14 expansion” because I’m pretty sure they would want to compete with FF14 and aren’t on the same wavelength as most of this subreddit on the subject of how well Classic will do or how they even perceive Classic.  
---
So, June 24th (which may actually make most sense, especially with Shadowbringers having an early access for those who preorder), July 2nd, and July 9th seem like more likely dates to me, barring an unlikely something that forces them to delay it.
---
No, and no thank you.
---
And cue the mass “Oh Em gee *Blizzard doesn’t do **ANY** support tickets for Classic they dont care about the game f u Blizztards! Rabble rabble rabble* Outcry
---
Problem being you're not as good as an actual rogue. Or an actual tank. On the other hand people will probably be happy to group with you because you wont have a lot of gear overlap in 5 and 10 mans
---
I wouldn't play it.
---
Summon infernals in goldshire.
---
Now we're getting somewhere.
---
Yes, tbc destoyed vanilla, which is why I quit after few weeks of TBC's release.
---
wtf...
---
You don't have to just use salt+pepper either, you can get away with all sorts of awesome seasonings.   A favorite of mine is herbs de provence (you can buy a container in the spice aisle or google how to mix it up yourself) and garlic along with the salt&amp;pepper.   Cajun seasoning and/or lemon pepper works well also.
---
Arena and rbg would be a mess with the fairly unbalanced vanilla
---
That and there’s mostly just Release Date, date for a beta test to work out any remaining bugs and inconsistencies, and how many servers will be there at launch to talk about. Stuff that can wait a month or two with the stated release window of Summer 2019.  
---
The time to panic would be if they maintain radio silence until the end of May.
---
A bit of the pasta water should also be in there.
---
Arena with specs that can global most opponents would be retarded.
---
Just because they might release one redeeming game doesn't mean I'll be buying their stock lol, they still got tons of crap left on their plate xD.
---
fat != carbs in any universe.
---
Actually TOO MUCH protein and too little carbs (talking at or beyond keto levels) can = excess carbs through protein gluconeogenesis (no i'm not making that up).   Fat never equals carbs though.
---
Shittalk in Barrens.
---
In my opinion the person who has the mats ready to craft it or someone who has started at least.
---
Legendaries should not be wasted by dkp. 
---
Getting all the mats is a huge commitment. 
---
Redridge would feel my wrath!
---
LOL you make me spit my drink.
---
Hmm..NO ONE BUY! SELL EVERYTHING YOU HAVE!!
---
so I can buy it cheap now and sell high later
---
Better DPS can be had from BRE, Asscandy, dual wielding if you're a warrior. Also the hand has a proc that takes up a debuff slot so its not ideal to use in a raid.
---
Rbg started in cats. Premades in vanilla are honestly worse than rbg because the meta is so stale.
---
It wasn't but I would like to see rbgs  to be honest. Arenas wouldn't work with how unbalanced it was
---
Taco Soup:
---
- 4 14.5oz cans of Diced tomatoes
---
- 2 cans of Rotel 
---
- 2 packages of Ranch Dressing seasoning
---
- 2 packages of Taco Seasoning 
---
- 1 14.5oz can of whole kernel corn
---
- 1 14.5oz can of hominy
---
- 1 14.5oz can of kidney beans (I use light)
---
- 1 14.5oz can of pinto beans (or substitute second can of corn)
---
- 2 pounds of beef
---
- Garlic to taste (anywhere from a teaspoon to a tablespoon of minced garlic)
---
- 1 large onion
---
- Salt and pepper to taste
---
Drain the beans, corn, and hominy leave the other canned goods as is.   Dice the onion.  Brown meat, drain the fat from the meat or not as you prefer, add onion and garlic to sweat the onions then dump everything else in and simmer on low for a least an hour OR transfer to a crockpot and cook on low until done.
---
Have some tortilla chips, sour cream, hot sauce, and shredded cheese on hand and you've probably got a week of meals or more (for one person...usually 3-5 days for 2 people).
---
Me too. I was between druid and shammy. I hate tauren so this makes my choice of playing a troll shammy easier.
---
That's a good way to get kicked from a raiding guild for having garbage DPS.
---
Please search, this topic has been discussed at least 50 times on this sub
---
Actiblizz problems goes beyond what a classic success can fix unfortunately...
---
I really feel Arena's were the cause of class homogenization in WoW. The constant balancing that is needed in a competitive scene, especially around 3 person teams, when the rest of the game is balanced around teams of 5-40, necessitates the sameness of classes and does away with specialists.
---
My condolences, sounds like he lived his last years surrounded by friends all the time.  Thank you for sharing this story
---
Kudos.  This man adults.

also dispell protection !

tbc when

depends on how much time you have
---
Blue post **on** classic.
---
The title made me think it was some old post by a dev 14 years ago.
---
It's not efficient for anyone outside of hunters or warlocks. Those are the only 2 classes that can do 5 full clears (all 3 bosses) in under an hour. Each run nets anywhere form 4g to 12g depending on the drops 
---
I tried it on my feral druid for a while but could only get in 3 runs an hour which makes shit gold. Killing princess alone took up 8+ minutes, balance druids can kill her much faster but then they can't kill the goblin or croc as casters. 
---
Also the problem with warlocks is they don't have stealth or feign death. They can get through without aggroing but you have to stay focused which is annoying to do when your running a dungeon over and over again. One wrong move and you're dead which sucks cause it's a pretty long graveyard hike. All in all I think it might just be easier to farm dme lashers or first boss dogs in north. 
---
what a legend
---
gonna go out on a limb here and say ryan's mod is DOA
---
No. PvP was an unbalanced mess that only rewarded having a premade and investing time.
---
Run horde hunters through Darkshire to get the superkitty.
---
No thanks.   
---
I liked the way classes were distributed, it felt more lore-friendly.
---
Buying stock on emotion, smart!
---
Classicdb pulls their information from the best available source, so when classic actually launches, it will be the easiest to use site.
---
More like buying stock based on facts...
---
But have we clearly communicated that we want Classic?
---
Hey, that’s ridiculously below market value for a level 60 if we’re going by old-school account selling prices. 
---
RBG came in Cataclysm.
---
Arena came in TBC (unless you count Gurubashi arena).
---
Vanilla is an RPG, not an action game.  The focus is on the RPG aspect of your character as you rank up, and accumulation of what is essentially a PvP XP bar.  It's not on e-sports.
---
do i detect some salt or do you not own a phone?
---
&gt; an unrealistic goal for the vast majority of people
---
Right, because farming over 10k gold in mats isn’t unrealistic for most people. Ditto for being the one person to get the eye *if* it drops. Spinal Reaper is a thing, and so is Drake Talon Cleaver. Those are realistic pvp weapons for pallies/shammies. 
---
I would quit the game.
---
I got an action bar addon, which made it a lot easier to bind things.
---
If you're an active and highly engaged guildmate then no, you will be one of the 3 hunters taken into AQ.
---
If you are less active and less engaged you will be a hunter that gets left out. 
---
Fuck, I want that IBM Model F mechanical keyboard! 
---
Planning on rolling a druid as my main this time around. Easy access to raids, easy levelling, hard to kill in workd PvP and as I usually live in WSG so can flag carry
---
yikes
---
I played one in vanilla and had a great time. If people don’t appreciate you then you are playing with the wrong people.
---
That's the one I have been using for the past 2 years, and I really like it.
---
One note:  For a while, about a year or so ago some security software on my PC flagged that site as being unsafe and malicious .  I don't know more details and I still used it (with high security settings)  but I thought I should mention it. 
---
“We met in Goldshire” ♥️ 
---
This. Sharding. Classic WoW is a sandbox to me. With sharding it isn't. It's the main reason I cannot get into Elder Scrolls Online at the moment (can't see my friends in the same town).
---
Everyone things Druids are bad.
---
Until they need a combat rez or innvervate.
---
I would be happy if they just announce they will not go with Loot-Trading and the retail report system. Well exicted anyway about news soon.
---
your initial assumption is wrong. There was a (raid)group queue, and they removed the button for it, but not the functionality. as a result,you could (with a macro) still sign up as a raidgroup, which I did at one point sith our guild after BWL, and we completely wrecked them.
---
I would ride around on my mount in contested zones defending my faction. If there are people trying to kill my brethren, outnumbered or out leveled they shall feel the wrath of endless spawn camping. However I would watch a 1v1 and salute the winner. Honor above all. Lokthar Ogar!
---
I saw another poll that said 65% dps, 25% healers, 10% tanks (if I remember correctly)
---
“I’m tanking HEAL ME”
---
Brings back a lot of good memories. You guys did a fabulous job of rounding up the adds. 
---
The rag kill is a perfect example of how people actually played in WoW when they were new and less experienced. Go back and watch the video and look at how many insane debuffs hit Rag. At one point he gets mortal striked for gods sake. When you’re struggling for every little bit of damage, common sense goes out the window haha.
---
And for the record, I have also cast moonfire on Ragnaros. Call the police.
---
you should only die twice. Take the armor penalty and just graveyard jump. You can get to wetland harbor town in 5 minutes or less.
---
What we want is a simple lightweight (TEXT BASED) database.  The less fluff the better. 
---
And it is very important that user can comment on database entries, so the community can slowly build up a useful collection.
---
The greatest thing of old thotbott and alakazam was often the comments of the users, who told all kinds of stories about NPC A or item B. That is also the reason why we still use databases with wowhead comments from 2005-2007..    
---
Let's give an example:

item:  Barman Shanker

Comment by OtherGuy on 11/07/2006:(Patch 1.12.2)
---
How to Solo the Bartender (Plugger):
---
First, if you want to do it yourself, you must be at least level 58 to stealth through to the Bartender. Listening to jellybotswana's strategy (see above), do what he says, but this is how to do it alone.
---
This may cost atleast: 10g
---
First, you'll need the following:
---
Major Healing Potion
---
Greater Shadow Protection Potion
---
(The reason this may cost at least 10g is because people mostly sell the Major Healing Potions and Shadow Protection Potions in stacks of 5.
---
First, go up to the table and buy 2 beers off of Plugger. Go to the corner with the Tauren for the rep turn in's and stand in front of him. Use a bear on the floor right in front of you, one will walk over to it and pick it up and get stunned, kill him/her. Do it again, until the two people standing at the bar have been killed. Then use your shadow protection potion, and stealth up to him. (He will not appear to be attackable, but he is). Use Cheap Shot or Ambush, kill him the way you would any other MOB. Be prepared to have the Major Healing Potion ready.
---
TIPS:
---
Shadow Healing Potion - I would use this 2 minutes before the fight, so if he breaks through the potion, you have another one to pop, without waiting for the cooldowns.
---
Evasion - This is a must.
---
Cold Blood - Use it on a 5 point eviscerate, if you have it.
---
Thanks.
---
 No rated pvp is one of the worst things ever added to WoW.  Leave pvp as the side game it is supposed to be.
---
I forgot about buffs that you can get from mind control. Thanks this makes me want to have a priest alt just to mess around.
---
Was so proud to get Sul'thraze. I remember convincing a rogue to let me have whichever one of the two swords I didn't have-- i.e., getting him to not roll need.
---
Gank the fuuuuuck out of everyone of course. C'mon, why wouldn't you. All these people trying to act all high minded and mature, or saying they're too old now for such "childish" things and want to be productive. If I wanted to be productive I wouldn't be playing a video game.
---
If it takes 2 runs, that's 2650xp less the first run, and 2650 added the second or third run. Back to back (even to back again), that's still 22,422xph if it needs to be run twice, three times and it's 20,766=xph - still more than okay.

You mean Earth Defense Force 4.1 and get a free copy of Vermintide 2. EDF EDF!
---
haha, i played on a private server once, and some guy in duskwood was inviting people for sfk. I asked him if he is sure about it. Then when we had 5 again I warned them all, what it means, they reacted like "wait sfk? lol that is horde dungeon" "wow that is too far", "we dont even have quests there". So anyway, finally we got 5 people who all accepted the challenge, and moved out. Got killed a bunch of times in hillsbrad, and we got to the dungeon, when two guys realized the first couple mobs were grey to them and ragequit.
---
I think it was a fun journey overall, and I got the southshore FP out of it. But many people will not be ready for it on alliance lol 
---
Almost every person I have played against or with, who claims to be currently under the influence of weed, have proven to play terribly. I have nothing against it myself, but I now just ignore anyone who states that they are smoking, because I know they are going to be playing badly. At least that's my personal experience.

The shout also affects pets, so locks and hunters can count as 2 people

Hunter Alliance NA PvP
---
Looking for a guild with raid times starting at 7pm ET, twice a week (mon-thurs preferred). Mature audience preferred, no racist barrens chat bullshit. 
---
I'm looking to be a core member of the raid group to secure my spot as a hunter through progression. 
---
I'll be going engineering most likely for those reliable jumper cable rezzes. 
---
I love pvp and am looking forward to mastering my class as best as I can in the off time. 
---
this guy knows how the game works
---
There's salt for sure.....but he's also probably right.
---
I personally have nothing against mobile games if they continue to make great PC games......but that's rarely the case. Whatever, totally digressing here. 
---
I can see how you might think that but no, it's similar on the surface but its not even close to sharding as you not only have control in who you play with and see, since there wouldnt be sharding on the realms and the realms would be merged afterwards. You also dont just trancend into another dimension of your real realm. 
---
Its not sharding, not even close.
---
From my experience on private servers:
---
The big materials are 8 sulfuron ingots, and 50 arcanite bars.

Sulfuron ingots usually go for 1k each +-100 gold. Arcanite bars depends a lot go from 25-30ish so in total you are looking at around 10k gold. A typical good farming spot nets you 50g/hour, so 200 hours of farming gold. That is unless if you guild helps you, which some might.. but in honestly sulfuron is a pvp for fun item, it does not benefit the guild to help you out, and most guilds I know will sell any ingots they get on AH.
---
No, you would be able to play with your friends as you would literally just pick 1,2 or 3 with your friends.
---
And its not sharding as you actually have controll over which realm you are playing on, **not** just getting tranceded into another dimension.
---
Classic WoW alone can't change the direction of the ATVI stock, as of now even long term investments looks bearish. Keep in mind that a majority of their revenue came from microtransactions (in-game WoW store, Overwatch cases and what not) and classic WoW is not even close being relevant in that department.
---
So.. no. I won't be buying until I see some numbers from Diablo mobile.
---
Its not sharding as you would literally not have sharding. Sharding is random and uncontrollable, and my suggestion is entirely controllable.

this is literally just a template slideshow shilling your guild, fuck off.
---
It won’t make you play better if your not good at the game. What weed does in highly competitive games like LoL if you have a good skill level is it sharpens your focus for intense moments because you play calmer and don’t raise your heart rate, which allows you to make a good decision in critical monents like LoL team fights.
---
You are only funding evil if you buy activition stock. 
---
Not really?
---
Typically MT gear loot council. Offtank/fury tank can be loot council or it can be DKP, it depends. Both healers and casters often need same gear yes ? So what, whoever spends most dkp gets it.
---
Pvp items can either be rolled, lootcounciled to pvpers, or just used credits. It really doesn't hurt the system much at all.
---
Since it will require having Naxx and C'Thun on farm status, it won't be a thing for at least a couple years minimum depending on how Blizzard spaces out its content gate for Classic.
---
And since it was only a thing at the VERY VERY tail end of Vanilla, a lot of people don't really remember it as a thing that was available, since many of the few Atiesh's were actually obtained during TBC.
---
I saw a few people on my server (Arthas US), I think the first went to a druid, but I could be mistaken (it's been so long I can't remember). 
---
I'm playing melee (rogue) this time around so no for me, but my SO is playing a priest so I'm hoping she gets it eventually. 
---
Lol this exactly. "But dude I'm DPS spec!"  you can still tank dungeons fine with Arms or Fury with a shield...
---
I hope Ruth Bader Ginsburg plays classic. I want her in my guild. She'd be a great paladin.
---
I think Blizzard are quite shocked at the shear amount of interest Classic is getting.
---
Fans are like bad project managers, sometimes it's best to keep them in the dark or risk them getting all panicky and stressed out. Giving constant updates on unfinished tasks is a big pain in all industries. 
---
If I would make my optimal wow I would have them instead of the regular vanilla PvP system, but to combine them, big no 
---
The only thing that I can say I really miss about TBC (apart from Kara which I guess is 100x more important) is that Black War Raptor...
---
If you show up regularly, farm consumables, generally help your guild mates and farm your pre-BIS you’ll have no problem raiding. This goes for every class and most specs.. depending on your raid goals, even meme specs. You and most of the sub are overthinking this. Your best class ability is reliability. 
---
Or the group accuses the soloplayer to be a ninja. Now what?
---
Undeads can’t be Paladins.
---
Don't even joke about that. Probably one of WoW's biggest mistakes.
---
And the posts get longer and longer. What a fascinating bot explosion. 
---
Chinese district lol, wtf.
---
Too real.
---
In PVP, arms warriors enjoy rocking sword specialization. For maces, it's a lot easier to get exalted AV rep and have the unstoppable force (with a stun proc) with mace spec. 
---
Hordeside, arms warriors can actually do pve dps with the right setup. An example would be having the hamstring rage reduction gloves, and using Hamstring to, alongside melee swings, proc sword spec double-strikes and windfury to jump up to max rage and burn it all on your main damage abilities, rinse and repeat. 
---
On my pserver, we had an arms warrior who competed super well with the other dps. And at least on a private server, he was able to use sweeping strikes, go zerking stance and whirlwind and each whirlwind hit cleaved (at least as many times as he had charges).
---
So long story short, swords are better if you're a pve arms warrior, you can get an epic stun mace by spamming AV.
---
Beyond that, I think it's just the culture-- Ragnaros always seemed to be the thing that our raid's pet enhancement shaman deserved. He put in a lot of effort to earn his like, 350 dps in absolute BIS gear, haha.
---
What I LOVE about Vanilla is that it is an RPG and not an balanced e-sport.
---
ooooooo harsh! but funny!
---
Yeah, I remember this too. They moved too another host and applied a new ssl certificate, maybe it's fixed now.
---
Now if I can just figure out how to use Wowhead on my phone without having it explode...
---
They are going to announce something big on April 1st and we’re all going to laugh it off. 
---
You have the same control over that normally too because you can group up with the people you want to play with, and you have absolutely no control over who else plays on the realm any more than you do the shard.
---
The average player would literally not even notice a difference, until the merger happens and suddenly your realm goes from dead to active with a bunch of players that didn't exist before. With sharding, that's a gradual transition instead.
---
It's not sharding. It's a worse version of it.
---
If you've played on private servers where preform AV enabler is used to allow this type of play, you'll know what the result is.
---
The way you gain the most effeicient honor in AV isn't from killing the opposing players. Its from zerging all the NPC lieutenant/commanders/towers and finishing as quickly as possible.
---
If you have a fully formed raid there is absolutely zero incentive to engage enemy players, the incentive is merely to race them in the PvE parts, and doing this nets you more honour/hour than any other BG by far. The bonus is it doesn't even matter if you lose, because unlike other BGs you still get honor even on a loss and what's more is you aren't competing against the the opposite faction for honour. You're competing against your own faction.

&gt;why was there never a group queue option implemented for AV
---
I could be wrong but I think there was a join as group option, but it was removed. I remember the higher levels (I wasn't a high enough level to join AV before they removed the option) telling me it was removed because, for some reason, they couldn't do a level check when you joined as group for AV, so level 1's and 2's were getting into games, so they just removed it as an option entirely. 
---
Again, I could be wrong seeing how I wasn't a high enough level to join AV before this feature was removed, but I do remember higher levels talking about this when I was leveling up. 
---
My dad works at Nintendo. Can confirm.
---
I was pretty disappointed in Pokemon Go. I was hoping there would be a battle and Pokemon catching system like in the GB versions. Without that, it was just boring
---
"It's not a nice place any more, but back then Goldshire was a pleasant little village, where you could meet new, interesting characters" Is this specifically referring to the debauchery that goes on on RP servers. 
---
I play horde
---
I used to own shares in Activision, purchasing them in mid-2007. I held them through the Vivendi merger and eventually sold them around 2013. I don't anticipate ever buying shares in ATVI again for a variety of reasons, but I certainly don't think Classic can single-handedly bring up the value of the stock; the company is far too big these days, and Classic isn't monetized enough to help them out... and if it becomes monetized enough to help them out, well, Classic will simultaneously lose a ton of players.
---
I knew of one on Ronorra the druid.
---
&gt; "It's not a nice place any more, but back then Goldshire was a pleasant little village..."
---
We used to go up there and duel.  There was an unfinished town up there in late betA/early launch. 
---
If the quests are repeatable it will reduce the number of games by a decent amount. As the cap for bases Quest gives a thousand rep. But I somehow I doubt it's possible to complete the multiple versions
---
Is that an oomkin going melee at the end there?
---
Good times!
---
Arguably highest skill cap class. Most people suck with them so they’ll get crapped on
---
Very difficult to master all shapeshifts, abilities and mana pool in pvp. But if you can do it successfully you will crush. Druid can take almost anything 1v1 except lock. You’ll need to LOS a lock. Rest of the matchups will always be won by a druid playing its cards right.
---
Also super fun in pve. Bear is an absolute unit and tears through mobs, cat does insane dps if you can find someone to tank the mob so you can consistently face its back
---
And just as a reminder - Naxx was released June 20, 2006. TBC was released January 2007. You might think, wow that’s a lot of time to get Naxx on farm status. Of course, you would be wrong. A lot of people quit in September due to school and other summer vacations being over and given the sheer amount of consumables needed as well as needing 40 competent raiders, it was basically an impossible task to do Naxx to any great degree.
---
I quit to stop myself from ruining my life and went to a different university and my guild exploded at the same time. Even if you wanted to grind up 10 new players worth of gear, it just wasn’t happening when the raid completely demotivated people and everyone knew 10 more levels would make the raid a laugh.
---
People here act like everyone will have BiS and every consumable. Dude I'm raiding as a ret and my only consumables are mana pots. You'll be fine unless you want to have naxx on farm. 
---
garts

1) yes

2) as quick as I can but probably not speed run per second

3) pretty much

4) quoi?

5) considered it but no. Cba to level all that way to do it again in 5 months.
---
I know we talk about community policing itself, but did no one experience situations where scumbags had enough people to form their own communities? I knew guilds of people filled with guys who would take advantage of others, and the response to being called out "We don't care" and they'd go back to doing whatever they wanted. Just a thought I had based on my own experiences. Feel like we should consider it a possibility more often.

I don't think it's going to be a cash shop for gameplay items, but I won't be surprised if they try to sneak one in for stuff that's "just cosmetic". 
---
There'd be some pretty epic community outrage though, and they don't even have the typical justification of server costs since everyone is paying a monthly sub already. I'm cautiously optimistic 
---
gg
---
Why would I do this? If I start the game with the best gear there is nothing to play for anymore. The journey is the destination.
---
IDK about you but I plan on being a Night-elf Mohawk.
---
Hello Crap, nice article.
---
I’m gonna see if I can get one to drop.
---
Greedo scene way better than Jabba's tail scene. Cut the Jabba scene.
---
It was also better not seeing the snow monster on Hoth other than the hand.
---
My experience in soccer and LoL. It sharpens your focus in high intense moments. That is why diaz bros were banned from ufc for a long time. They would smoke in the locker room before a fight allowing them to be “in the zone” and dominate their opponents. In Brazil it is mandatory to smoke weed before training for the same reason. 
---
I like to smoke before soccer because as a striker it allows me to be hyper focused as a striker allowing me to hit my target even in non optimal positions like being off balance or at sharp angles. In LoL it helps me stay calm in intense moments so I can make the right decision.
---
Not gonna lie, "Plaguehand" is a pretty cool name.
---
You’re not allowed to call out players anymore
---
If you eat way too much protein it will indeed be converted into carbs. All of that being said. You would have to eat a lot of meat to have that equal the carbs of one bag of chips. 
---
Eating all meat is also really boring. If you are ten years old it sounds sexy and appealing. That being said I would kill for a sweet roll. When you only eat meat. You tend to over eat less. My guess is this is why I am loosing weight but I don't know.
---
Imagine that name on a warlock instead of a mage! Beautiful! 
---
Yea it has nothing to do with their garbage numbers recently. Nothing to do with with them dropping hots. Nothing to do with Destiny being dropped from activision. Nothing to do with the projections they have for their last quarterly earnings report set to come out in a few weeks. ITS JUST THE STOCK MARKET OVERALL BRO. RIGHT?
---
1) Oh yeah definitely.
---
2) Probably not. doesn't mean it'll take months to hit 60 however. Professions during the leveling will be kept up.
---
3) Sort of. I've done Vanilla so often I have a good idea which zones are for what level brackets. Nothing set in stome except avoiding STV in favor of other zones (seriously STV is not mandatory if you know where to look).
---
4) If sharding happens it'll only be in starting zones, and sharding would only assist on actually killing X amount of mobs/quest elites. So I don't see it being an issue.
---
5) See Answer 3.
---
That's an excellent idea. At least log for names is a definite.
---
I agree on your thoughts. They should gate the new- and upgraded gear along with the raid patches (which also should be more than four). That would eliminate the gear problem but not the power gained simply by the late patch.
---
Harsh but necessary. I get nothing but stream vibes when I visit. The features I want feel like they're tucked away behind things I avoid. 
---

Corporate talk

I think you meant to say "TBC" not Cata.

Standing at the opposing factions entrance to stv. Welcome to classic :D
---
Thiiiiiiiis
---
Too sad people cry more about lootsystems and racials than enjoying what we have...
---
I think retail allows for 5-man Party to queue together. Premade AV groups always coordinate over voice chat and that woks fairly well. Blizz / Holinka is already on record that they don't want large premades queuing into BGs. I'm not sure whether this thinking has evolved in BfA.
---
&gt;Besides, nobody liked Cata or playing as a Panda.
---
Well, that's just not true. I think WoW peaked with WoTLK, but I still had a ton of fun in Cata and MoP.
---
A 60 ding is a full congratulations

Only a fool would use such emotional information to get into the game of life.  The same fools got into bitcoin and they are now broke fools.

Here is a set of questions you need to ask about any company you want to invest in.  What is their revenue?  What is the cost of running the business?  Have they had a good track record of 15-20 years of paying their bills and making profits?
---
The stockmarket often reflects this in sensible ways, where a comapny's value is in line with their stock value.  Sometimes this is off where a company is severely overvalued.  Look at all the crashes 1999-2002.  Those internet companies were overvalued, but because of public perception, fools bought in raising the value of the stock to prices far beyond what the actual company was worth.  The same can happen in reverse where a stock is 50% of the evaluation making it a steal.
---
Going forward I wouldn't put any money into gaming stock, no matter how good the projections are.  I would advise people to pull out of gaming.  Because legislation is coming for this lootbox fiasco, and the mobile exploitation.  Companies see that pot of gold and they are investing heavily into those markets.  Lootboxes are a scumbag way to inflate profits under the guise of cosmetic knickknacks, but legislation will come, and you will see those companies invested in those antics have plunging price points.  I don't think it will destroy Blizzard, but the time you want to purchase ATVI is after legislation hits and the stock price plummets as people react emotionally to the news.  That's when ATVI will be bargain bin prices, and from there they will transition into a different kind of profit scheme that will bring the stock price up.  Providing those who thought it out with a healthy boost in their portfolio.
---
But do not buy stock or in invest in anything at all because you have faith in the product because you're a fan of the product.  That is how you lose money.
---
If you go into a LoS war with a Warlock, I wonder what ends first, his health pool, or your mana?
---
SL Lock with Voidwalker shields are super mana efficient and you have to worry about healing yourself as well.

The winner will probably be whoever else randomly gets backup and gets to double-team the other before anyone actually loses haha.

Yep, this is real vanilla.

Moon Guard specifically, where Pornshire is a 24/7 party. Last time I logged on Typhanyy, my Pornshire stripper, it was still stupidly active. That was only about a month ago.

And black lotuses

Before battlegrounds there were open world scheduled PVP battles.  There was even scheduled 10 man PVP squads always posted on the realm forums.  Get 9 other friends make a group and PVP against other 10 man groups.  Battlegrounds kind of ruined this, the only thing close to it was Blackrock Mountain had MC+BWL and a few other instances all in the same mountain with only two entrances-- one for each faction.  You ended up sharing raid times against certain other guilds which developed some fun rivalry's that continued on to eastern plaguelands during Naxx times.
---
Wow look at all those skills :)))
---
&gt; Your reputation with Argent Dawn has very slightly increased.

Logitech G600, 'nuff said.  12 programmable buttons on the side, with a couple more on top.  Also a g-shift key which essentially doubles this number.  Super easy to use software, and it has held up great for over 3 or 4 years now I think.
---
The only keys I use on my keyboard are for movement/jump/chat, everything else is done with the mouse.
---
There aren't any in game systems for guild vs guild. Blackrock Mountain is where guild action happens when raids try to wipe each other as they head to MC and BWL.
---
Fantastic article. Places like Azeroth and Gelinor (RS) are the places where I’ve met many of my good friends in life. Rip bro 
---
My guy... lmao I am not sure if you are trolling or not :)))

Activision will recover, all gaming stock seems to be in a lull right now.

Cata was probably the easiest expansion the game's ever had. The welfare was high. And the launch content was a shit show. Almost as bad as BFA.
---
Yes, no, no, no, no.

WoD was better than Cata.

You guys are discussing bud like it's one plant. Sativia will make you heady and focused. It is used to help people study. It is a ped for video games.
---
Indica a different type of bud. Does not do this. It melts your brain and makes you sluggish, slow, and relaxed. It is the opposite of a ped. 
---
Whether or not bud is going to help you step your game up. Is 100% down to what type of bud you acquire. 
---
Studies find that giving bad news closer to release will soften the blowback by 67%. 
---
Absolutely! I really hope we will be seeing a resurgence of more oldschool RPG names like this with Classic.
---
&gt;  what do you do?
---
Stop playing.
---
Im actually really happy that he had such a nice group of friends. seemed like super guild for anyone to be in. may he rest in peace.
---
Also, it's 4:1 meaning you could be even turned to a bad guy if they try enough.
---
Look at that beautiful not-so-wide screen!
---
I thought the black war mounts came out towards the end of vanilla, or am I mistaken?
---
True, I didn’t get into details because judging from downvotes people here are 12 year olds that think they know anything about weed, let alone sativas and indices. And your right, my favorite strain for soccer is sour diesel, one of the more potent sativa strains.
---
Screenshot of this generation in my opinion!
---
Out of everything in this picture, it's the bandages that make me most miss vanilla. Nothing like freezing a mob in place, blinking away then desperately bandaging before it caught up and killed you.
---
Funny thing, my Vanilla guild got 4 eyes, and we ended up giving the last one to a Druid because the guild bank had no ingots and he was the only guy willing to pay.
---
I'm no medical expert but I'm pretty sure it has to do with the resistance created from the rice works as both prehab and rehab for the wear &amp; tear caused by various things you do with your hands/forearms.
---
Remember that this is not really needed for the younger crowd unless you have a condition or use your equipment wrongly.
---
I got Sulfuras back in the day.  It really comes down to how the guild chooses to distribute them.  Most guilds should really plan ahead of time and not wait until the moment it drops to figure it out.  Some see it as a reward, some see it as a progression item, some see it as just another dkp item.
---
So, how did I get mine?  I was an enhancement shaman.  I was a guild officer.  I showed up to every raid.  I pvped enough to be rank 10.
---
The order of which of those are relevant will change person to person, but honestly, it was super common back then for legendaries to go to officers.  That's partially playing favorites (we've all heard tales of the moonkin officer with Sulfuras), and that's partially because many officers are officers for a reason, usually because they show up for every raid and you can depend on them.
---
Yet, even with all those conditions, I still had other hurdles to overcome.  I wasn't the only officer in consideration.  There was another shaman, but he had just reached rank 14 and passed on sulfuras.  And beyond that, there was our top dps warrior who could make use of it.  He wasn't an officer, but he did show up to all the guild events and he was very good.
---
Ultimately, it did go to me, but there was still other things that had to be worked on.  Firstly, by the time the Eye dropped, we only had 4 out of 9 sulfuron ingots.  And since no other guild had an eye drop yet, all the other guilds were saving theirs, meaning getting a hold of the extras I needed was a very expensive prospect.    They ended up costing between 400 and 800 each, and we got them from a couple Alliance guilds (we were Horde) and two IIRC from a guild that was transferring in from an older server.  There's no guarantee your guild will cover that either, as that much extra gold lying around is unlikely if you're progressing heavily.  50 Arcanite Bars are no joke either.  I was lucky enough to have a friend who was hording them and had like 20 of them, but honestly, getting the remainder of those was actually the bottleneck for me.
---
Not really. I mean it's viable to some degree, but typically by using a BRE. Not hand of Rag.
---
1. Yes, Yes, Yes,
---
2. Yes,
---
3. Not specifically because you never know where during the process you will get ahead of the heard so to speak. 
---
4. No but this sort of goes hand in hand with question 3
---
5. No because they havent really changed and if they have then there is just no point.
---
It’s almost like playing a multiplayer online game with other people is advantageous... this isn’t a solo game 
---
&gt;... it'd be a serious shame to log in at release to find bugs because Blizzard's internal QA team was stretched to its limit recreating this.
---
Honestly, I feel like experiencing bugs and laughing at them is part of the vanilla experience. But I'm also coming from software, so I guess I just appreciate the effort they put into restoring the game. 
---
I did a some reporting during the original beta and in the early days of vanilla. Made me feel more apart of the community, really... 
---
before they made personal loot mandatory everywhere they made it so that if you 'need' on something it will become soulbound. So unless your friends all happen to actually need the item in question, you won't be able to steal it. I don't see why they wouldn't keep this idea for classic.
---
Can anyone help me out here? What's [this ability](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/531298390911352833/543110093265305600/Untitled.png) on the actionbar? Been through the mage spellbook and can't find it. Is it a trinket or something? Don't recognise the icon.
---
RIP buddy. I'll poor one out in GS this summer in classic for sure. A shame you couldn't be there with us all. 
---
Look at all these idiots downvoting you for speaking the truth. Classicwow is in such a sad state.
---
Arcane explosion keybinded to 1 sick
---
You missed the point. You were doing with people on your server and in your pvp battlegroup. People you'd known since battlegroups were introduced at the end of vanilla. It went *completely* cross-realm with the Cata prepatch.

Because Classicwow seem to want to downvote anything that is sensible because they still think a 2005 mindset is somehow applicable to vanilla.. I got downvoted heavily in another thread for saying Hunters and melee dps dont share ranged weapons (which is 100% a fact)
---
Go figure.
---
So basically you admit your guild is useless? DKP is the absolute worst system for making sure guild goes to where it will benefit the guild the most.
---
The feels man... 
---
What an epic guild that was. Mad respect to all of them, and to the family for at least trying to understand. RIP man, wish I would have been able to meet in game such a cool guy.
---
This never worked for me back in the day. I was never a well know person and I had groups do this very thing to me a lot. I was even sitting in front of dungeons offering to heal (played priest for a good while) when groups couldn't find one. So groups of 4 were stealing loot from me this way and when I called it out in chat and such no one ever payed any attention to it. Chances are the group I was talking about were the well known folks on the server and no one listened to me because they liked them or something.
---
Makes being a solo player without a group a friends to play with tough. 
---
You must be fun at parties.
---
Naw. 
---
This was our first kill of Loatheb, can't remember the year but I believe it was Horde first, probably not server first however. The second photo is a clip of my stats as a fury warrior mid fight, probably not from the same kill though.

Hope you all enjoy!

Hello! I am a gold farmer, and I play the hunter, to get the gold!

I was a bit of a stone man in my halcyon days. I have the wisdom of the sacred texts and great knowledge of herbs and lore.

Source: Trust me bro.
---
Lol what the fuck dude? It’s a different way of distributing loot. Certain items were reserved for tanks but otherwise its a fairly even system to distribute loot. 
---
Hey I dinged 60 there too
---
Checked your logs, and your dps is dealing less DPS on patchwerk than other guilds pull when BWL is relevant content.
---
Yeah, DKP seem to be very great at gearing up the raid lmao
---
Right? fuckin rich guy here I am with my margerine containers
---
Isn't the simple answer to that to not group with that guild?
---
what do u mean? our current addon for vanilla pservers won't work?
---
**THE** milestone. Just think about what it took, and what he/she experienced to get to this point.  
---
A fantastic moment that ends leveling and begins endgame, recognised by all no matter your wow experience. Seriously I was half through BWL and I remember a 60 ding still being a guild moment.
---
Congratulations.
---
ez
---
&gt;It is the only way for you to operate a 40 man raid.  Did you even play classic?
---
Imagine actually believing this. DKP is a garbage system, that's just the facts. The system does not in any way distribute loot in such a way that it benefits the guild. It almost exclusively benefit whoever can game the system to their own advantage.
---
?
---
I’ve never raided with DBC though. I killed KT pre world buffs with my guild, DBC killed it after world buffs were implemented.

not everyone has multiple monitors - so 1 can make an arguement that those folks has the advantage vs those who dont own multiple monitors. 
---
Unfortunately, there's always people who don't check those forums or blacklists or whatever, and it still happens to them. 
---
DKP and fair? What?
---
Yep. Allowed you to see buffs on an enemy.  
---
That's about as vanilla a spell as it gets lol.
---
I dought it
---
And then your fury warriors start having to hold back every raid because the Maintank dont have the DKP to get DFT, Chromatic Boots, Accuria etc, and cant hold aggro.
---
I had AE on 1 with modifier for throwing rank 1, frost nova on 2, cone of cold on 3 and blizzard on ~.      
---
      
---
Mana shield, ice barrier, mount up, pull huge, ae r1 spam, fn, aoe grind that xp. At least from lvl 49~ when the farms in WPL are killable. 
---
I like how the experience bar stays despite the fact no one was going to be leveling past 60 for a while. 
---
And you get downvoted. Classicwow must have some of the dumbest users I can imagine.
---
Even today on p realms you pay like $250 and more for a lvl 60. For a frikin private server character.
---
It's only people with terrible dps who hate dps meters. 
---
The issue is with loot Trading, is that loot could become much less of a "thing". It's highly possible the community won't give a damn when Trading is involved.
---
On a rogue? Instantly dislike this.
---
idk about you but if any1 i run a dungeon gets an item and then "offers to sell it to me" thats a instantly red flag. A normal person would just give it.
---
That's not really an answer though to the specific premise. The premise here is that those players will be "punished" via the server ostracizing them. Yet if they aren't actually affected in a negative way (they are self-reliant), then they aren't really going to have a "surprised pikachu" react moment. They'll just shrug and keep playing within their guild groups of fell jerks, and probably keep victimizing ignorant PUG players who don't know their rep yet. 
---
So while the answer to the question of "How do avoid ninja looting? might be your answer, it doesn't really address the premise of the OP. 
---
No progressive itemization. 
---
&gt;slow weapon speed
---
I guess you are just another clueless idiot who dont know how threat works.
---
If they are into money they better release Classic without MTX because otherwise its DoA.
---
My favorite name from vanilla was an orc shaman in my guild named ‘Marty’.
---
Haha thats some 10/10 solid logic there
---
Jesus Christ no one even knows what HOTS is in the financial world
---
NO one has any idea that actually exists. No one at Goldman Sachs plays fucking world of Warcraft, no one plays fucking HOTS. The people who play video games are not the same kind of people who move the global economy.
---
No one cares about your shitty video games in the real world
---
Their 3rd quarter earnings call had a garbage balance sheet and terrible projections
---
The outdoor dragons were some fun GvG activities. 
---
Do you know by memory every purple lotus spawn in the plague lands, bonus points if you haven’t played since retail vanilla.
---
That's fair. The only real thing an individual do about a self-reliant group of assholes is to spread the word about them. To loop back around to loot trading, there will be assholes who roll need on shit just to vendor or disenchant. That's just more rare than this situation would be with loot trading.
---
Ain't nobody got time for that.
---
4:3 aspect ratio
---
I think you’re thinking of Harvest Festival 
---
As I said. I know the secrets. We do not pick our lotus in open fields. We go to the deep places. We farms them there, when no ones is looking.
---
here is a list of my current addon for a priest that I would like to see in Classic:
---
* Bongos
---
* Cartographer
---
* CCwatch
---
* Clique
---
* Cooldown Timer
---
* HealComm
---
* Luna Unit Frame
---
* MobInfo
---
* OmniCC
---
* Onebag, OneBank
---
* Outfitter
---
* Postal
---
* VCB
---
* WIM
---
* X-Loot
---
* And of course Questie
---
&gt;Hang tight, https://www.classicwow.live/ working hard to bring a fresh alternative :)
---
Get outta here with this. It's so blatantly just another wowhead advertisement farm in the making, but minus any real content. Twitch, streamers, just promotional material everywhere.
---
This is what we actually want:
---
1) Lightweight easy to use database
---
2) NO ADS AND PROMOTIONAL CRAP
---
All that brightness is straining my eyes. Nah, dark themes are the way for me. 
---
Agreed. I guess I'm not too invested in whichever way loot trading goes. Being invested in your community is going to be the best way to avoid jerks either way. Just like getting into discussions about community behavior. It was pretty cool to experience, hope it holds up in Classic. 
---
Midnight to 6am lotus farming, I like your style. You will be a wealthy man and the masses will bow to you.
---
(8:50 PM, server time)   Oh, crap!  I’d better head down to Gurubashi!
---
&gt; Bliz loves shock announcements.
---
We know it's been a while since the last update. BUT... Classic launches in 8 minutes. GO.
---
Rams are beastmode!
---
I'm at a loss for words, and a proper response to your reply would be a huge wall of text that I'm not willing to write unless you're open to discuss and willing to read it, I don't wanna shout into a void.
---
My original warrior hit 60 in roughly the same area. It seemed like such an epic achievement back then!
---
Except it’s not, since he has combustion and is now on his way to level 61..
---
No, actually I just farm herbs in DM lol. Herbing in the world is for noobs.
---
Yeah. I think Classic would be better without it, but it's not a deal breaker for me because it has it's up sides (and it's own problems).
---
It’s a close one but druids win an los war
---
Druids have decurse, innervate helps with mana, hots are super efficient, moonfire/swarm will tick away at the lock. In a 1v1 the lock just doesn’t have the sustain the druid does. Huge burst heals to full HP are just huge. 
---
But having LOS around usually means a stalemate. Only a shitty lock dies there because he’ll run around the corner himself into the druid.
---
If the druid gets a cat stealth jump on the lock, even in an open field, it becomes much closer
---
But in general as soon as you get to an open field and a lock can easily fear dot and the fight moves heavily in their favour
---
In that case of course (but will you refuse to buy it if it's an important item and its the first time you see it in 20 run ?)
---
But in the case of friend needing and giving gear to each other, you will not see it if it's done well.
---
I don't think we played the same game. I'll leave it at that.
---
Ah, the classic side by side chat and combat log arrangement!
---
Not OP but wanted to interject maybe where they were coming from. Ulduar and ICC were phenominal raids, the problem is this is the point where Blizzard began progressively nerfing content for all to see. It wasn't just nerfs to normal modes it was across the board.  I was either running or participating in upwards of five GDKP runs a week or selling mount/gear runs to players in questing blues.  Everyone who had a brain or gold had a Valanyr or Shadowmourne, invincible, full heroic t12 partly due to the duration of ICC until Cata. Really the only prestigious item accessible in the game at that point was a gladiator mount or the black crusader warhorse and neither of them stood out because they used other models.
---
To call wrath "teribad" is just silly though.  Wrath was very good up to the point where we began seeing the future of wow which I blame more on the post-shattering timeline than Wrath.  Homogenization of classes, removal of class defining features, cross realm features, thousands of meaningless achievements, increased availability of welfare gear ect. 
---
In worried myself my job requires a 2 week block to be booked for audit reasons I’ve had to book a random 2 weeks in “summer” 
---
I hope they tell us when it will release soon. I’m super anxious I won’t be able to take the time off. Most games tell you the release date a year before. This is cutting it fine :s
---
100 free hours of ideal grinding. Arcane Crystals. Purple Lotuses. Raw gold. Rare Recipes.
---
Ganking's dumb.
---
Warlocks can and do do it. Its not as fast and easy as hunters but still good gold per hour. Other classes farm better in other areas. 
---
Feral is actually really good, as a tank it’s similar to warrior but you still need warriors more, as a dps it’s actually pretty strong but you have to put in a lot of effort, like farming gnomergan endlessly. Resto is good, and definitely the most desired. Boomy is just bad tbh you can sort of play balance hybrid specs but it’s pretty bad outside of world pvp. 
---
&gt;Will I have trouble raiding?
---
Only if you're a bad hunter.
---
Now off to Naxx
---
Blizzards own right vertical bar not moving the quest log out of the way, lol.
---
Probably farm gold and then max out enchanting and get all the rare enchants so that I am the only one with them when everyone gets to 60.
---
Action bars completely full too. Vanilla should’ve included 3 rows at the bottom IMO.
---
It blows my mind a game from 2004 is so much better than its own expansion version over a decade later
---
The guys designing maps and zones, coding, doing art, music, placing mobs, talents, builds, they were all in the fucking zone. 
---
People please give it a read. 
---
It gave me the chills. Thanks for sharing OP.
---
as a parent and gamer this made me tear up a bit! &lt;3 
---
Me too! I think I was fighting Scourge Champions as well. 
---
 Hi All
---
I think I can help shine some light on this one.
---
A link to my lv 60 rogue back from vanilla. Please note, I was in no way a mob grinder, and I did do quests to level up:

Everything that isn't 1:1 is a mistake in a way, but they've already said that they have to go with 1.12 rather than 1.1 and we can't do anything about that. It's kinda arbitrary to not have Dire Maul out at launch when you have talent trees and mechanics as seen in 1.12.
---
They will not work.
---
I edited the post with the answer
---
easy enough just to record the encounter, recording is bunch easier than it was in 2004
---
How to get Atiesh:  
---
Be as many of the following as possible;  
---
• Guild Master  
---
• Raid Leader  
---
• Master Looter  
---
• Class Leader  
---
Bonus: Be a Mage (I believe this aura is valued the most? This could be wrong though, don't recall, I seem to remember many priests getting it)
---
&gt;I don't understand why communication is bad. They have enough people to write some wall of text every week. And for fans it would be very engaging.
---
Because people will just complain and complain and complain some more at everything they say, they'll get spammed with messages on every post telling them how shit they are when they realize their farfetched idea of classic isn't happening.
---
This sub is a perfect example of why they don't post consistently, people here constantly speculate to the atom and get their heart set on unrealistic things. 
---
How will you be able to log in and NOT play?
---
You gotta at least try it right?

[When i think about everything Pre-Cata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFDcoX7s6rE)

Bad bot.
---
Fury warrior will probably be the hardest class/spec to find a raiding spot with.
---
You're asking the real questions here.
---
I continually debate whether or not I'm going to tell my manager the truth.  He's a senior director, and I'm fairly high up the chain as well, and I fear that telling the truth will be something that's "frowned upon" by others.  My manager would probably take it in stride if I told him, but its others who may not understand.  I don't think I'm paranoid in saying that I could be looked at differently if word got out that I took a week off to play a video game.  
---
But shit yeah, I'm taking that week off regardless.
---
Yes
---
No, I'll be taking my sweet sweet time. Now that doesn't mean ill be lazy, I'll be playing 24/7 and tank whatever dungeon people want and try to keep my professions up while questing. Warrior prot leveling takes its time, isn't optimal. But it's what I do.
---
Not really, I'll be going to winterspring, hinterlands for sure though.
---
Yepp, go and kill some mobs that (shockingly) not alot have noticed (Human start zone) 
---
Nope, not about to level to 60 just to throw it away.
---
Might side level a mage to atleast lvl 30-40 for convenience.
---
My old Tauren Warrior alt back in TBC was named "Felhammer". Imagine my surprise when I went into my order hall with my DH in Legion.

I agree 100% about the comments. So much of the info is contained there, which is why I still use classicdb over vanillawowdb or twinstar, because they have the old comments from retail version of the game, so even though the item values might be more accurate on another site, most of the time the information I'm looking for would be in the comments.
---
I'm just one guy on the team but I do have ideas for mining old comments and presenting that information when you look up things on the database (not just copy-pasting WoWhead comments, because those could use improvement too)
---
If you don’t want DM our at release then we shouldn’t have Mara at release either. Itemization changes (as far as item stats changing based on “patch”) shouldn’t be done in classic.
---
Either go full boar 1.1-&gt;1.12 or go with 1.12 with tiered content release. I don’t want a hodgepodge of items and other things changed for the sake of “difficulty”.
---
Same 
---
Reading this legitimately made me tear up a good bit. 
---
I mean when you have 3 pure-dps classes in a 5 man group, and ONE of them is doing 40-50% or more of the group's damage... you can't expect that person to not be annoyed by it?  Not everyone enjoys carrying terrible players through dungeons and raids and splitting the loot with them.
---
I am totally new to reddit and posting here.
---
I got a mail that my post was deleted do to i need to wait 24 hours, but its here?
---
Can anyone please confirm that you can read my post above? :)
---
Yes. They are pretty easy raids that drop lots of good catch up items 
---
And with the new blizzard support system, if all 4 of them report you, you’ll be very close to a suspension
---
Your average player doesn’t have 24/7 recording running on their pc, and won’t have that for classic.
---
&gt;if they continue to make great PC games......but that's rarely the case.
---
Has there any developer thats completely jumped ship and only does mobile games? It seems to me, most developers do both.
---
Lol yea I’m in the same boat. I run into the dilemma now that if I say I’m going out of town, then I can’t be seen anywhere.  Grocery store, gym, etc. I also have a gf who works in town so she has to be on the same page also. I simply cannot tell my co workers/ boss that I’m vacationing to play a game and will be at home. 
---
blizzard doesn’t want to deal with people submitting loot tickets to support/gms
---
Instead of having balls and saying “we will no longer intervene in loot issues”, blizzard is parachuting Cata/wotlk loot system into Classic.
---
It's technically announcing that they WILL announce an announcement.  ***announcment to dereference.
---
Advertise free ports in a main city. Then chuckle when people realize they are in Deadwind Pass. 
---
Naxx was a kick in the nuts to a lot of guilds.  I raided in the beginning of Naxx and quit, since the additional time sink outside of raiding was crazy
---
If they keep this loot system, the entire Dungeon experience 1-60 will be fucked because of it.
---
This loot change is the single biggest change they’ll be making to Classic.
---
Sharding is fine for starting areas like they’ve said. But this loot thing is huge. Open to so many abuses, which happened all throughout cata/wotlk..... I hope they get their head out of their ass
---
Girls like guys with good skills
---
So many time I went, waited, watched.... But every time some max lvl player showed up.
---
one time a rouge waited till I was literally trying to open it... Fuck rouge players, piss weak people.
---
Opposite ideas are fine, my issue is solely with people using #nochanges to shut down discussion while themselves asking for change.
---
There is absolutely nothing wrong with what you want, and ultimately it’s still both a game I would play, and a game I would view as better than retail should you have your way
---
I'm all for some changes, but changing race/class combinations changes the game quite a bit and raises too many questions.
---
Things that I want to see are mostly UI and keybind centered, and *maybe* making it so Shamans don't lose their weapon skill level when respecing.
---
Most notably I think aggro and the debuff slot limit need to be better shown in the default UI.
---
"It seems most, if not all classes using 2 handers are not really viable for PvE raiding. "

Photo is a lie and it’s easy to spot. There was no exp amount on your exp bar after dinging 60.

---
Lol these numbers aren't accurate at all sry pal
---
The bad thing about this system is, you won’t know who is abusing you.
---
Groups of friends in wotlk/cata would de-equip items to make it look like they needed them and then trade them to their buddies after the dungeon run was over.
---
You wouldn’t see them typing in chat to each other so you’d have no idea they were buddies. But on discord or teamspeak they’d be laughing at your ass and needing everything

Honestly the best way to get Sulfuric Hand is to start a guild. Molten Core is low hanging fruit for raids. So you will be able to clear it with even a mediocre guild. It's not like you are trying to form a Naxx guild. It isn't that hard.

Your opinion is understood, some people want all the videos and the guides and all that stuff, and some people want just a clean lightweight database. I completely understand and agree that accessing a database needs to be quick and painless, I'm a user myself, of course. I avoid WoWhead myself, I'm not going to put hours of my free time into a project that's going to create the same bloated thing (I'm not a founder, not a manager of this site, not a streamer, so I'm not doing it for ad revenue or Twitch subs). What you see there about the content creators and streamers is mainly what is most visible now, because like I said, database solution has people hard at work trying to deliver it soon.
---
Mage: 2% Spell Crit  
---
Priest: +62 Healing  
---
Druid: 11mp5  
---
Warlock: Damage and healing by 33  
---
Looks like Mage maybe Priest to me.
---
Even if I remove the 2 quests that give 1500 rep. That is only another 10 games on top of the 270 it takes. I can post all my math or link to my spreadsheet showing all the math. But 320 is frankly looks like an incorrect number.
---
Also The link you gave me doesn't match what you posted, that link doesn't mention 320 games at all. And the math you posted is different than that link says. 160 for 10 rep is on live not on classic, Retail lowered the resources to 1600 to win but kept the rep gains the same so lowered the rep to 10 per 160 gained still netting 100 rep for a win.
---
The 130 rep is true for a win on AB weekend since 2000/150 =13.33 so 13 ticks of 10 rep
---
Maraudon is not a major concern to me; it was available at launch in EU and available about 6 weeks after launch in NA. Dire Maul at launch is more concerning as it was more of a "catch-up" dungeon for early raids and had great pre-BIS items, so I agree there.
---
I'd guess we might hear more on this by the end of March, but my guess is that they're more concerned with technical issues right now rather than release schedules of gear/dungeons (which, presumably, would be a lot easier to modify than getting the base game up and running fully).
---
&gt;Nothing to do with the projections they have for their last quarterly earnings report set to come out in a few weeks.
---
That's ATVI, Blizzard made 635 million last quarter, which is up 13%. 
---
https://investor.activision.com/static-files/8229563c-2259-46c7-8acb-42ea074b896f
---
Their stock has been bleeding way before it dropped 10%, yet they didnt announce anything, either. 
---
And stock value declining doesn't mean a company fucked up, it could be investors being idiots, see: https://twitter.com/zhugeex/status/1093167757254946818?s=21
---
1) Obviously  
---
2) I plan to play a lot and go pretty fast, but not 'speedrun' per say.  
---
3) Kinda  
---
4) That's the main plan not the backup  
---
5) I've done the leveling many times over the years so I guess you could say yes. 
---
All we heard about that was something along the lines of "our current plan but it's still open for discussion". That's why I want an update fast (before it's too late) because they might have changed their minds on certain things. It's important to keep in mind aswell that Blizzard probably wants classic WoW to take a longer time, if they could spread it out to 2.5 years instead of barely 2 years then that would be much easier to control and then prepare for what's next.
---
This makes me want to roll a rogue so bad ;)
---
As someone who joined TBC, I've always wondered how the arena works. Care to explain what goes on here?
---
Seeing that multiple keys have 1 to =  bound to them, I would say this guy was a clicker in vanilla.  Not knocking him or anything, I was a keyboard turner when I first hit 60.  It's something I look back on and laugh at myself for.  I even have a PvP video showing me doing it (also backpedaling LOL).
---
What?  The experience bar totally stayed after getting to 60.  My roommates and I had a competition to see who could ding 60 with the least amount of experience in that bar.
---
Why do you even care?
---
I remember questing to 60 and wondering often what would happen to the xp bar... it was fun to imagine what would come next. 
---
Yea, 2% crit &gt; 33 damage imo. 
---
In case anyone is curious like I was:
---
Naxx was released June 6, 2006.
---
World-first Atiesh was on September 9th 2006 (Risen, went to priest named Failure).
---
Patch 2.0 (technically 2.0.1) released December 5 2006.
---
Mages are one of the most popular. Rogues are one of the most popular, Warriors are one of the most popular... Theres a lof of "most popular" classes maybe thats just the normal distribution
---
I would love to see a true 11 patch classic WoW...
---
However I understand why these changes were made, and out of sympathy for new players let's not revive the brutality of true 1.1. This game shouldn't just be for the hardcore enthusiasts imo.
---
&gt; before they made personal loot mandatory everywhere they made it so that if you 'need' on something it will become soulbound. 
---
That system was added in cata and only apply on BoE loot and not Loot Trading for 2h that was added in Wotlk.
---
#iamverybadass. Weren't you taught not to swear in bible school?
---
You quoted someone else so maybe you should go debate with them instead. 
---
One way that vanilla is unique is that 40 man raids (where most of the best loot is) have a few drops per boss. At the end of tbc, magister’s terrace (5man) has purples. The only thing more low effort than that is BFA daily purples.

Exactly:  “muh hard drive space!”

That's a very fair assessment, and since the database and other tools haven't been developed yet, it's tough to see past it at this point. The tech team will make sure to handle it properly, since we're all users who see the flaws in WoWhead being too bloated, and other tools missing value and key features - which has motivated people like myself to put hard work in their free time to develop. I, for one, understand your opinion and will advocate to keep the database and tools lightweight.
---
Rape the fuck out of the tunnel between Loch Modan and Wetlands.
---
&gt;Because hey what else am i gonna do? Farm gold for two months?
---
Why bother farming gold ever?  You're BIS, guilds would pay you to raid with them.
---
Yeah but aren't you supposed to play with new people, strangers, and meet new friends?
---
Chili con carne with wholegrain rice is like the ultimate meal prep in terms of nutrients and time.
---
Minced beef, sauteed. Add veggies of your liking and canned tomatoes and canned beans and voila, done in less than an hour!
---
Other than that, fried rice is quite good. Chose any protein and veggies of your liking and add rice and eggs and some seasoning and it's relatively healthy!
---
Rags wasn't killed before DM release. I don't see this as anywhere near as big a deal as others make it out to be.
---
Not really, he's already BIS why does he need gold?  Guilds would pay him to tank for them or whatever appropriate roll for his class.

There will be 100% to many ret palas in raids.

Of course I'm salty, why shouldn't I be? I loved wow. It was a big part of my life for a long time. Now it's trash. I'm not saying pet battles are the reason why, but they perfectly exemplify the direction the game has gone in and the new player base they're pandering to.

Entering the pit of the arena flags you for pvp with everyone else (including your own faction). A chest is placed in the middle of the pit every three hours which everyone fights over.
---
&gt;2) Are you going to speed run?
---
Speedrun. Thanks.
---
It’s hilarious how this fight was such a bitch, and then the BC pre-patch dropped and you could 5 man him with a warrior tank and four shadow priests...
---
Easy carbonara, the method i prefer is using only egg yolks mixed with parmesan and pasta water. Even creamier than cream! (Guanciale for the win as well)
---
The Gurubashi Arena is a place for PvA open world PVP. You can kill anyone, even your own faction members, unless you're grouped with them... and at any time one of your "friends" can drop group and betray you.

A pirate drops a treasure chest on the arena floor at a certain time every day. Inside the treasure chest is a green item that starts a quest to loot the treasure chest many more times. After you loot the chest I believe 11 total times you earn an epic tanking trinket. People used to have huge free-for-all battles to determine who got to loot the chest each time it spawned. In the end, there can be only one.

Trying to decide if I want to play a Gnome or Human still. Gnomes are kinda lame looking but humans are boring.
---
I also want the Gnome racials.
---
Probably gonna be a gnome...
---
When you hit revered, you are basically halfway. So being halfway to revered means you are not even halfway.
---
I did this in retail vanilla on a nelf, with stormwind. Searched out every quest on wowhead to get a horse. I was so far off, that on 50 (yes 50, not a typo) I turned in a metric shit-ton of runecloth to get exalted, and my first mount on the character, hoofed it until 50.
---
People argue it both ways, thats why this meme has impact. "In vanilla the community could come together to blacklist people". But its also "Blacklisting wont really be an option because blacklisting didnt really actually work in classic at all".
---
On one hand people said it was successful and community moderated, and on the other people claim it doesn't work at all and cannot be relied on. Im sure its probably somewhere in the middle, but this IS pretty funny.
---
A pound of chicken breast is one meal for me... 😢
---
We gave it to our Druid in retail vanilla. He attended every raid from onyxia to kt and deserved it. 
---
The only way to get it is to be a guild officer or leader.
---
&gt;Also The link you gave me doesn't match what you posted, that link doesn't mention 320 games at all
---
Terribly sorry about that, I dismembered which source I used when I wrote [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/akmesr/how_long_to_get_exalted_with_battleground_factions/ef7g6eh/?context=0) a few days ago. I've fixed it. 
---
Your points are very valid and well understood by the tech team. What you see now is of course the loading page as a background introduction, the site isn't even released yet, which is why I said the teams (multiple - tools, database, guides, videos, etc) are hard at work to get it out soon.
---
I, working on the database, agree with your points and will be keeping in mind for that portion of the site. Many people want videos/guides/entertainment/etc, most people want efficient lightweight tools and tech. Those two don't have to clash and intrude on each other
---
The macro "HELP" bottom right. Real vanilla. Getting jumped out of nowhere by enemy faction. Only help was community.  Best part is you would always get a where or an invite lol. 
---
Yes, Druid was in my guild. His name was junoon. 
---
As people have probably said before me:
---
-Use every number 1-9 with the frequency of use and importance being higher for the lower numbers easier to get to quickly. (i.e. 1-4 are often used spells).
---
-Every letter near WASD should be bound as well and the same logic applies for importance/frequency of use as you get further from your fingers on WASD. so, Q E R Z X C V F G T Y H (those are good to begin with).
---
-Now thats a great base to start getting used to it all (its miles better you will love the change) but if you need/want more just apply Shift to all of those and youve just doubled everything!
---
-If you are still needing more apply Alt just as you did with Shift and your going to be good by then for sure.
---
This is my way of doing it and I think its very simple and doesnt require unbinding any of the movement keys you are used to.
---
**Also pro tip**: clicking and holding both right and left mouse makes your character move and you can guide it my moving your mouse hand, this frees up your ability to use keybindings with your left hand.
---
**Additional pro tip**: If you jump while moving in a direction you can take your "hands off the wheel" and use a keybind then get back to your movement keys before you land to not miss a step. This is especially useful for kiting!
---
DING!
---
I agree, and really this would help out more than it would hurt. For people getting loot the intended way they won't even notice anything, but for those who like to abuse it then will have a way to help with it. 
---
I'm honestly a little shocked I remembered, but that was a big deal back then. 
---
Question, was it you guys or Ret that had server first KT kill? Was Ret still on the server at that point?
---
Irrelevant, if there's an item that's really needed by a member of "scumbag group of friends" they put a reserve on it.  Or "scumbag group of friends" don't pug another class that needs that item.
---
Dire Maul is a pretty messy issue because of how wow was released, on EU barely anyone was even capped by the time DM was released (just about a month after), so should it be released 4-5 months after launch or only 1? 
---
Honesty I don't see it as that big of a deal considering we will already have 1.12 talents, slightly better bracers or another agi hit ring isn't going to be the difference between killing ragnaros or not.
---
I highly doubt there will be a "discussion" on this beyond a very closed feedback loop.
---
Where did this delusion you have begin where Blizzard became highly interactive with it's community during development?
---
Personally, I expect to be told what is happening and that I have F$%&amp;-all to say about it.
---
Ret has the world first ouro which is pretty crazy, but we beat them to kt by a few weeks I think.
---
We both moved to Malganis just before tbc, and it ruined the game for me. Arthas was the best server on earth, so many legends were there like pat, maydie, roguezeroskill/mute and tons more.
---
I quit the game soon after the move, tbc ugly as shit design, flying mounts and transfer ruined the game for me.
---
Procs from Druid weps (or weapon enchant) do not work on that server. Afaik they have the “blizzlike” armor numbers and others have buffed values. I’ve played on servers with both and really hope we end up with armor values on the high end in classic, everything just explodes when you can get armor down to 0.
---
That's why when you saw someone with a different faction's mount it was crazy epic.
---
Glorious.
---
It wasn’t the same after ya’ll left. Nothing against &lt;TG&gt; or &lt;SECURITY&gt; but their members didn’t have the charisma (or the progress) any of your members had.
---
I forget if &lt;Proven&gt; was still around and raising by that point...
---
Other than the near complete and total change of being 1.12, utterly different patch rollout, completely new engine, emulated weather effects, possible sharding, possibly no future live updates OR possibly completely new future updates ... etc, etc ...
---
ô¿ô
---
I mean I'm young but I do RSI stretches at my desk when I play for long periods. Prevention &gt; Prescription
---
[Guild] congratswwwwwww
---
Haha exactly.  I can’t wait to taste little gnome tears 
---
I played vanilla and never knew about this. I was also 14 and sucked at the game. Still do since I started playing few months ago on pservers. Cool shit 
---
I found this difficult to read as it was very relatable to my life, aside from not sharing a degenerative disease.  We're similar age, used the game as a similar outlet, made powerful friendships the same way, and my parents shared the save views as his.
---
Realy solidifies my values of people first and my eventual setting into a social guild because this family is one I always want to be part of.
---
RIP friend
---
Also do wsg plz!
---
The Gurubashi Arena was also a place you summoned level 3 players from Durotar with promises of sweet loot only to have them get mercilessly killed and have no means by which to escape their newfound hell.
---
Or you could put your level 19 think there and grab enough treasures so you get an arena grandmaster.
---
Activision can die. EA can die.
---
The industry is healthier and better with more independent development. If Blizzard can keep Classic untainted from the RMT influence, even if their other games are cesspools, I am fine with them still being a shell of the company they once were.
---
I'll worry about any Classic management corruption as it comes, but not now.
---
How tf could you ever farm 50 arcane crystals in 24h nigga what
---
Calling all Alliance Players: meet me outside Orgrimmar and 1v1 me bet you won’t you scared /chicken.
---
&gt;it just wasn’t happening when [...] everyone knew 10 more levels would make the raid a laugh.
---
I don't get it. Are you saying that somehow TBC expansion made people not want to progress Naxx?
---
I want to bring back the term Care Bear from '04 to describe all the people on reddit who complain about PvP on a PvP server.
---
So, I actually hold a short position in ATVI (meaning I'm betting against the company). I plan on playing Classic and honestly wish it were July 16th already. The market knows some people plan on playing. That information is public and baked into the current stock price. 
---
As much as we all love Classic, it's a niche product in the company's much larger portfolio. If Classic fucking goes to the moon after launch and brings in 2-3x retail's current subs, the stock will rise when that information is reported. Otherwise, it won't really have an impact. ATVI is just facing too many other industry-wide and firm specific challenges. 
---
My issue, as a fury war who WAS perfectly willing to tank, was this:
---
"Hey guys! I'm happy to tank this, but just a heads up, I'm gonna roll on dps gear since that's my main spec."
---
"Wtf, no, you're the tank you can only roll on tank gear."
---
That sound....
---
[Guild] grats
---
Depends what is out. Black Lotus/Devilsaur Farm probably, maybe DM Tribute. Gold is what will help my next character out the most, and with at least a week of being the only one getting all of these, it'll probably be enough to sustain the rest of the game properly reinvested. Then you can add in getting paid to carry dungeon runs and reserve recipes once other people catch up in levels
---
Go to Tarren Mill for a lowbie gank fest and get prepared to be banned from all the right click reports.
---
You still need gold even with full BiS gear. Consumables, Repairs, Respecs. But mainly, for doing another character. If you're already full BiS Naxx geared you'll have time to play another character easily, and can get that guy full BiS'd quickly with gold.
---
From most posts I've seen about Naxx and Classic running out of content too soon, I think Naxx is way underestimated. A lot of people forget about "gearing the raid" and just focus on how easy the fight mechanics are compared to retail.
---
Raid progression took A LOT of time just gearing up to even survive encounters, even if mechanics were easier. 
---
I would agree except to say that Hand of Rag can actually help in PVE if you have a dedicated Ret or Enh, in which case it would boost their DPS of course =P
---
Though IIRC it's DPS is on par or slightly below some BWL weapons so by the time you actually get it, upgrades from BWL are probably available.  The proc is still gorgeous though
---
How is this vanilla when he’s 60 and the xp bar just emptied? Wouldn’t that make it at least BC
---
Yes 1.12 is a rather easy mode Classic, but this may align better with attracting retail Wow and modern players to it. The game is still fun and it boosts raid participation as elitists aren't in total control of raid access.
---
Even the private server crowd likely couldn't handle a complete change to talents. It's all the little changes I look forward to from Blizzard trying to emulate the real server experience, which was lost to some of the private server admins just trying to make massive leveling grounds to support the harcore private server end gamers.
---
I took a quick look at the site's management, it seems that they're mostly streamers, and content creators in some fashion. If I was a part of this project, such as one of the people working on the database, I'd be very worried that my work is ultimately just a tool to push traffic to the management's twitch channels and such.
---
You said: "database solution has people hard at work trying to deliver it soon". You also mentioned that you're a user. I do not know what connection you have with the group working on the database. You may, or may not, be a part of said group. If you are, I would honestly recommend disassociating yourselves with this website and its management. Release your database as a standalone item. Because, in my opinion, if it does turn out to be good, it will simply be leveraged by the management to promote their streams or ads.
---
 Of in vanilla 
---
I agree, and malganis was absolutely terrible. It felt like the corporate version of wow. No community or fun pvp, just raiding like I was getting paid to do it. Arthas 2005-2007 will always be my best gaming memories. Classic won’t come close to replicating it but it’s all we have.
---
The joys of griefing is not bound by age 
---
Class and roll distribution across original and private server Wow have rarely changed. Just look at a chart from any year and you have your answer and projection.
---
Having a bad rep really did matter for stuff like this in vanilla. Thing is, I think the gaming community as a whole has drastically changed over the years. I don't think generally selfish and/or trollish behavior would be as looked down upon today.
---
&gt;You still need gold even with full BiS gear. Consumables, Repairs, Respecs.
---
Again any raiding guild you hook up with would pay you that just to be their MT.
---
&gt; But mainly, for doing another character
---
So you have a Ferrari and you want to drive a KIA?
---
&gt; you'll have time to play another character easily, and can get that guy full BiS'd quickly with gold.
---
LOL, another dreamer.
---
But gnomes are a society of science, not of faith. 
---
Those ENORMOUS buff icons, complete with time remaining. Gosh what memories 
---
My impression is that:
---
Vanilla = Original Game
---
Classic = New Version of Original Game
---
I think that term will make a comeback with classic lol 
---
If such people gathered in one guild, it would make much easier to avoi them tho.
---
Do you get any honor from kills here?
---
what class did the eye go to? didn't see them running around
---
This article hits really close to home. I had recently moved to the US and some of my only friends were the 2 boys across the street. One of the brothers, who would later become one of my best friends, had muscular dystrophy. He could walk, but with crutches. He and I played wc3 until 4am and had tons sleepovers. When wow came out we played that shit nonstop. He used wow to escape his disability and distract him from the fact that he would die before he turned 20. I remember I was there when he hit 60. He was the happiest I think I had ever seen him. I ended up moving away and we grew apart. Then I heard he passed away in his late teens. I regret not staying in touch with him but I'm grateful for the times we had together and that the little time he had on this planet, he decided to give some of it to me.
---
I went there every 3 hours for a week over half term, including 3 6 and 9am, on my prot pally during wrath. I kept the arena trinket (700 damage shield) until well into outlands.
---
It was still highly active during TBC. 
---
Sharding is splitting up the community on a certain server. Nowhere is it stated that its need to be random or uncontrollable (current implementation of sharding is controllable  to a degree though as  by grouping up you will always be in the same shard as your group members).
---
How would the folling work in your example, lets say i want to play with 3 IRL mates, Mate 1 has release day off, and rolls on "Ravencrest-1", i need to work, in the evening i log in and see "Ravencrest-1" is full, so i need to roll on "Ravencrest-2" meaning i can't play with my mate. Now Mate 3 was on holiday during release and comes back 2 weeks after launch, he needs to roll on "Ravencrest-3" because 1 and 2 are both Full. So now we cannot play with eachother, we cannont join the same guild untill possibly in the future the servers loose enough active players so that they can be merged. 
---
I really don't see the benefit over Blizzards way of sharding, which wouldn't cause any of these issues and we could al play together. 
---
On my pserver Russian and Spanish speakers in general are so incredibly infamous for ninja looting, dropping dungeons mid way after the boss they want is dead, etc,
---
that there is a guild called "La Lista Negra" or something like that meaning blacklist. So what you've said kind of happened here.
---
I wonder how many people will run a level 1 rogue there on launch with the sole intention of twinking one day. 36 hours to get all 3... I doubt STV would be too busy then. 
---
Haha OK will do. I'll have to do that once I get back to a pc 
---
Since I always duo with my wife, but she has to start at lvl 1, my plan would look like this.  Boost my wife through every elite/group/dungeon quest on the way to 60 while also feeding her gear/gold/consumes that I'm farming while she's working on solo quests.  Obviously, I also escort her in any contested zone and lay waste to any horde that goes near her or any objective she needs. 
---
 While she's working on solo quests/exploring that don't require my help I'll be working on my professions since by strict interpretation of the OP, our professions are starting at 0.  In this scenario, I'd go with mining+BS for my professions because with the huge headstart it shouldn't be that hard to turn BS into profit plus I can feed my wife gear as she levels.
---
Devilsaur + black lotus on an uncontested farm for at least a week would be outrageous. 
---
buff timers completely spelled out and overlapping the action bar "12 minutes" - yep story checks out
---
It's always a little strange seeing people ignorant of the stock market talk about stocks as if they're so determined by their favorite product.
---
The entire stock market is down and especially the tech sector. Look at *any* tech stock. ATVI, EA, GOOGL, NVDA, etc. They're all down. That and there's been a market correction, all stocks are suffering.
---
Thanks for the share! The feels are real. It's awesome to think just how much an MMO can help people feel included and part of a community that.
---
Think about this when interacting with others in a virtual world. You never know who you are dealing with or what their situation is IRL. The golden rule exists on the internet just like anywhere else.

Tailoring/Enchanting from level 1, because the spare gold from my free Felsteed isn't going to spend itself.
---
Why do you want to know?
---
Leatherworking &amp; Skinning. I'd like to make stuff for my squad &amp; I as we level, &amp; hopefully build out some catch up gear for people &amp; their alts. It may not help a lot, but it sounds fun!
---
Warcraftmovies.com was the place to go back in the day
---
Ashkandi I believe is Bis for Ret until R14/DEI/MoM. Mostly they should be swinging nightfall, but when the buff is up they can weapon swap for the deeps. I don’t think the investment into Sulfuras would be anything more than a vanity item. 
---
Like a decent amount of people I'll be rolling skinning just to vendor the leather as I level. Trying to decide between tailoring and engineering at max
---
Well, didn't you guys transfer to Mal'Ganis because Arthas started getting a queue of like, 300+ during peak hours? I pulled that number out of thin air, but I remember in mid-late 06 it started getting ridiculous. 
---
But yea I agree, nothing's going to beat that feeling we had 14-15 years ago on one of the best servers of all time, but I like to think we can do our best to come as close as possible to recreating that feeling. 
---
The first boss kill is always so satisfying. :)
---
From the credits it seems your raid got [Eye of Sulfuras](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17204/eye-of-sulfuras) from your very first Ragnaros kill, that is incredible!
---
1. Depends on when it launches, mid summer? sure! Late august? Work work.
---
2. If I can play during launch day and have 4 days off afterwards, yes.
---
3. Yes.
---
4. Sharding/Dynamic is only an issue the first 3,5 hours, afterwards everyone is to far behind unless all speedrunners roll on the same realm.
---
5. Not the latest revision.
---
Hmmm, well, you made a big assumption about me that is wrong then said a bunch of shit that is wrong.  Its funny to look at the replies and see so much bad information.  December was a bad month for stocks.  They recovered in January.  
---
Nope, it was like this in vanilla.
---
he meant soul link
---
That's a pretty wholesome reason. Your party is lucky!
---
1. Yes, i life permits it.
---
2. My plan is to speedrun to 30is, and then start cruising.
---
3. Yes, depending on how crowded it is, I will explore till lvl4/5 and then start questing/farming
---
4. See above and I might try to de-sync with my region, e.g. sleep at peak and then play very early morning until afternoon
---
5. Yes, 3 different until lvl 30. 
---
Are you more into PvE or PvP?

---
I am still missing the bluepost which says how loottrading will work.
---
or are people just assuming? 
---
That was when you would equip different spell level because of mana efficiency 
---
you are right, but I think it would actually be the perfect solution to this "dilemma"
---
Pretty sure I am playing Horde this go around (mostly Alliance on privates but retail I was nearly purely Horde and returning to it).
---
2. At my normal pace which is faster than many, slower than many.
---
3. I have many usual routes and places but always willing to mix it up.
---
4. Sharding won't bother me if only to assist launch day. Dynamic respawn systems DESTROY Classic as it affects the game eternally including end game (makes gather mats too easy, wrecks the market and eng game consumable ratios). Can't be worse than 10k server 1st day launches.
---
5. In the last 3 years I have leveled 4 hunters, 4 druids, 2 shamans, 1 warlock and 1 paladin to 60. I am pretty sure I know my shit when it comes to certain classes. 
---
Funnily enough it is bis for Druid fire resist tanking. Much cheaper alternatives exist though so it is horribly impractical.
---
Farm my epic mount then constantly gank the highest level Alliance player to ruin their dreams of speed leveling/faction first 60.
---
Then dont invite those ppl to your group. You are the tank and there are 20 other dps who are willing to come 
---
DING! 
---
If that's his condition, then I don't see the problem. It lets you either accept his proposal or not, so you won't be blindsided by his rolls. 
---
Both. May pick up mining as well just to stockpile for engineering
---
Hi, /u/Liedien
---
Don't worry, they still have about 6 months to choose if/when items will revamp, set a staggered release schedule, launch a playtest server, catch any erroneous bugs, take in player feedback, and consolidate all that information before launch to provide a quality product.
---
***~ Nervous Laughter ~***
---
Engi and BS on the same toon. I want to PvP and get Sulfuras as well but I hate alting so it's gonna be the hard long way for me :D.
---
Engineering for nades and the reflect damage shield and enchanting to disenchant blues from running lowbies through dungeons and crafted items from my alt tailor.
---
Pet battles are not even close to the issue.  In my opinion, features like pet battles are exactly what we should be hoping blizzard puts in the game to keep players who play casually happy.  Instead, they've completely bastardized raiding, dungeons, and the world to accommodate players of all skill levels.  To me that is the issue.
---
STV
---
Probably not a bad idea, would save you having to buy as many mats while the demand is high driving up prices.
---
I would play a warrior. The BIS I would choose would be for tanking. I would start a Gold DKP Guild called Hogans Heroes. Every item dropped would be bid on with gold. Non-guildies would always be welcome this guild is a mercenary affair after all. Then at the end of the raid. I would take 15% of the gold off the top and, divide the rest throughout the raid. I also get my even share for this as well of course lol.
---
In this way I would become by a mile the richest man on my server. 
---
I wouldn't need gear. I could buy people and, level other guilds with a word. Money is power, friend.
---
1. No, unless Blizzard leave out CRZ, tweak loot trading, have servers that aren't crashing with 30 people in the same area and ultimately it depends how they handle sharding. I don't want that system anywhere near my experience.
---
2. Depends on how I feel, typically I like to explore but I've played retail back in the day and on private for years. I may speed run if I feel I can find a good guild otherwise I like to take my time.
---
3. I don't have a 'plan' per say but I have a route I typically use that I know off by heart, it changes depending on where the zerg is.
---
4. Yeah, I'm probably going to spend the entire night celebrating even if it means just staring at the login screen with a big fucking smile. I'd rather put up with that than sharding. My neighbours'lll hear me screaming in happiness.
---
5. Yes, they mostly work but it depends largely on how the pack works out. Some times it can be slower just because I like to try and avoid STV until 40 which is very easy to do but really depends on where the zerg/pack is.
---
Sell my account to someone who would care enough to have this boost to pay for it.

Mining engi  on hunter
---
Yes. Even though no one knew what the gear would be like (quite a bit of Naxx gear was on par with great TBC gear) I recall assuming that the gear we got from Naxx would be completely invalidated by ten levels of progression. 
---
It’s really difficult to struggle against Naxx when you know you won’t be world first and know you probably won’t even kill many bosses prior to TBC coming out. Also, remember how you only have 3 reliable tanks? I heard a rumour that you need fucking 8 of them for one of the bosses...
---
&gt; I met Mats in a world where it doesn't matter a bit who you are, what kind of body you have, or how you look in reality, behind the keyboard 
---
This is something people don't understand, if they aren't gamers. 
---
Ok so you get free consums to be the MT for a guild and your dragged around doing 5 mans to gear them up then doing MC while the rest of the guild is in greens with no hopes for ever improving your items. You have basically no reason to play the game except to carry this guild who is paying you, but you have nothing to spend that gold on. Why are you even playing? It's obvious the best use of the first few weeks you have would be to help setup long term capital and use that to do another character. WoW is about the journey, not the destination. You're already started with a capped out character. I guess your answer is grief people in the barrens and STV for all eternity?

Katz took them up on that offer, and won despite interference and, IIRC, Trickery was accused of slowing down their internet to produce lag on purpose in an attempt to confuse the other players or something along those lines. Now, I'm not too sure on the validity of the latter statement, but Trickery was def less active on the forums after this was posted.

Atiesh should be an award for the most loyal member of the group, most likely the Guild Leader, because you get shit on for everything and have the most work.
---
You can't really plan for Atiesh. Atiesh will come to you, if you are worthy.
---
If you have a good group you can split raid. Half alts/ half mains in two different groups. Priority for big items goes to mains. It goes a long way to getting the main raid geared for AQ. 
---
Every single time an expansion has been announced people have kind of stopped caring about raiding the final tier, since you're gonna replace it in two levels with greens. Many people didn't progress Naxx as hard as they could have because TBC was coming out, yes.
---
Yeah I guess by the same logic if you're going for best PVE stuff then it would be easier for the guild to get Ashkandi than to get the HOR.  However, if you're in some wierd guild that can farm enough to get HOR but can't kill Nef then perhaps it makes sense =P
---
It might be private server shenanigans, but Corrupted Ashbringer is amazingly powerful with most of the straight up t2.5 / t2 gear for Ret.  Procs for 400+ with all the spellpower, proc can crit, and the PVP or single-player sustain is epic.  However, it might be a broken scaling value so who knows.  Plus it's a totally different gearing process as if you're swinging MoM you want mostly str/agil versus with CA you want those stats but also a good mix of spellpower to help the proc.  Side effect of having all the spellpower is having a ton more int usually as well so you can cast a ton more shit.  
---
I have a paladin with CA and all t2 / t2.5 and it absolutely crushes in PVP.  I can heal forever too because of all the int.  Fun stuff =p
---
Egg
---
From my experience I don't know any guild who has actually done that. It's certainly possible but most guilds won't have like a full roster of alts.
---
If current plan holds:
---
1st character Shaman: Skinning for money. Herb for money and stockpiling for alchemy. Untrain skinning at 60 and train Eng.
---
2nd character to level using rest xp Druid: Alchemy to supply all characters. Enchanting to help characters and to get to tanking trinket. Untrain Enchanting and train up Eng at 60.
---
3rd character Hunter: Mining. Eng. This character will likely be parked as a 59 twink for quite some time.
---
Dire Maul was released less than a month after EU launch, and ingame on Launch in Korea (?). If you feel that way about Maraudon, why is this a concern for Dire Maul? The gear is clearly better, but the reality for most players in the EU Dire Maul gear was available when they hit 60, even if they started on EU Launch, and that was the reality in Korea. 
---
People are also ok with other aspects of the game that reward having a group of friends with you. It isnt fair for loot trading but its not fair in pvp, farming, guild politics, etc.
---
Skinning / herb to level. 
---
Saving all my herbs, vendoring leather.
---
Herb/alchemy at 60, with hopefully enough herbs to get me 1-300 already there.
---
Pick flowers in RFK
---
Maybe. But people know it's coming this time around. Guilds will have tanks planned for four horsemen a year before it arrives. People will be collecting frost resist gear for Sapphiron from day one. Raiders will know before they even reach 60 that the're eventually going to want max AV rep for the trinket. People will be banking crusader orbs and grinding Argent Dawn rep in their late 50s. Gearing is going to be way easier than it was.
---
Then combine that with the fact that Wrath was the absolute historical peak of subscriber count, and Naxx version 2 was the _first_ raid of that expansion, it's fairly likely that Naxx bosses might be the most well known by the general population out of every raid in the history of the game.
---
Hi, /u/OozeBoy
---
You sound sad :(
---
It was objectively a different game. Nostalgia is definitely a part of it, but I think the series in general would have benefited more if they strayed less from what made the original game great.
---
The reasoning given was the player pool was not big enough to become a world first guild, which was stupid since I thought we could have been. Eventually the guild merged with death n taxes which lasted a few years, I still talk to some of the core group, they have mixed feelings about classic since they completed all the raids during retail.
---
It's not just nostalgia. It's genuinely a better game. I started playing again recently on a server that I can't name, just to answer this very question. I really thought I was just remembering a great game because it was the first MMO I'd played, but nope. I was getting genuine enjoyment out of it. Every quest feels like a real adventure again. No more hopping on your flying mount and blitzing quests in 5 minutes. 
---
Seriously give it a try. I'm sure you'll agree
---
Are they not a thing anymore? I just don't know at this point
---
So with the druid being leveled with rested, do you swap over to it whenever the rested is capped while you're leveling the sham? I like this strat.
---
They mentioned it at Bllizcon, there is probably a video somewhere but [here are Tips Out's notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yre21OeanlZ1urSz8HDyGpVobvEIN-YXfvKvQwH4CLk/edit)
---
Item 5. Obviously the video would be better but I have no idea which one it is!
---
Nice hat
---
I think that is what started the path current WoW is on - keeping casuals playing.  Eventually they'll get bored of pet battles and crave something else.
---
My favorite kind of grats. 
---
The past is the future. 
---
Wasn't big enough or good enough? Lol, Arthas was one of the more (not the most, granted) populated servers by a long shot, I rolled on it back in May of 05 because it had a high population! 
---
You guys def could have been (a world first), didn't you have a US first under your belt? That's no easy task. 
---
As for the old players coming back I get it, I mean, what else would you all have to do besides roll another type of character and play as it? Granted tho, you'd all be going up a different type of player nowadays, maybe you all could really put your skills to the test against people who have been studying this game for the past 14 years. 
---
Liking something that isn't new doesn't mean you're stuck in the past.
---
I appreciate the link. 
---
* Default strategy is mining + skinning.
---
* If running Druid or Shaman, change to herbing + skinning.
---
* If running Mage, option to change to herbing + skinning.
---
* If I plan to level primarily through dungeons as a healer (especially Paladin or Priest), option to change to Herbing + Mining
---
* If I want to be able to track both on a hunter, option to change to Mining + Herbing
---
**Why Dual Gathering?**
---
Dual gathering has several advantages over gathering+crafting or no professions.  
---
The advantage over no professions is simple: you get more money by having a crafting profession.
---
Everyone who is leveling a crafting profession is putting the same gear on the AH, so your economic means of leveling the profession become full of items you might as well vendor because the market is so diluted.  The only way to make money is to invest in the profession, which becomes a large time sink that I don't take advantage of.
---
There's another advantage to going dual gathering - bag space.  If I'm leveling skinning+leatherworking, for example, I might keep all sorts of leathers in my bank in case I need to use them.  I'll keep a bunch of other materials as well, such as hides, wildvine, elemental reagents, feathers, and anything that might be used in a leatherworking recipe.  
---
Then I get an alt that's leveling tailoring + enchanting, so I send all sorts of greens and cloth and recipes and the toon is just sitting there filling up its bank and mailbox.  What is the advantage to dual gathering?  Bag space.  Instead of worrying about keeping materials for a rainy day, just sell them!  Not only is this generally a better way of making money, but it also clears up your bank space quite well.
---
This works even better with a bank alt, so whenever you need to clear your bags, you just mail all your mats to your bank!
---
**Why Mining + Skinning?**
---
In terms of the gold you make on a profession, my experience has been Mining &gt; Herbing &gt; Skinning.
---
Mining is great, because two professions are buying your gear (BS and Engineering).  Even better, because Engineers are quite often min/maxing and will go dual crafting.  So you end up with a large market of people willing to buy your stuff. 
---
Herbing is next, because it's used for consumables, but a lot of alchemists can farm their own herbs.
---
That leaves skinning, which is usually the second gathering profession.  It fuels leatherworking, which usually pairs with skinning and they can farm their own mats.  Skinning is generally far easier to level and far easier to farm.  I typically run into points where my skinning is gray on red-level mobs (thanks, Nesingwary).  Because of all of this, skinning is generally the worst.
---
However, it's easier to do mining + skinning than to go back and forth between Find Minerals and Find Herbs.  This is why Skinning is the most popular second gathering skill.
---
**Why Herbing + Skinning on Druid/Shaman?**
---
You can skin and herb while shapeshifted.  You can't mine while shapeshifted.
---
**Why Herbing + Skinning on Mage?**
---
Mages are very slippery, but very squishy.  Mining takes time because you get 2-4 loots per node.  A frost nova around an herb will yield better results than a frost nova around a mineral node.
---
**Why Mining + Herbing on a healer?  Especially Paladin or Priest?**
---
As mentioned above, druid and shaman lend themselves to herbing + skinning.  
---
However, also as mentioned above, skinning is the most popular gathering profession, which means it's likely that someone else in your group has skinning.  This gives you a broader range of things you can likely loot without fighting over it with another player.
---
Why not a tank?  Because the tank is too busy tanking to swap trackings.  You're also right there when the beasts die to be skinned.  So stick with mining + skinning.
---
**Why Mining + Herbing on a Hunter?**
---
Hunters can track a lot of things.  On the one hand, it makes sense to go with the default, because when you're tracking Hidden or Giants, you're not tracking Minerals or Herbs.  However, you're used to cycling trackings, and you're used to being able to track things for quests.  This allows you to show all those flowers that must be picked for a quest, or those bloodstone nodes you want to hit.
---
**TL;DR**
---
The TL;DR was up front.  If you want to invest time into the profession, go crafting.  But going dual gathering is best in general.  Mining + Skinning should be your go-to, unless you shapeshift (then it's mining + herbing).  Other than that, have a reason to go with Herbs instead of one of the other two. 
---
Most of what you want to make while you level, someone else will make.  It will be cheap because they made 20 of them for skill points, as did the other dozen people leveling that profession this week.
---
I was going to do herb/alch but this sub seems to be filled w/ people looking to do the same so I'm thinking of what else I can roll. 
---
Officers felt malganis had higher skill players, again which was bs, arthas has plenty of great players. They got to ahead of themselves. I felt if we stayed on arthas we had a chance at world first just as much as going to malganis. 
---
We had a bunch of top 3 horde us during aq and naxx, I know we were 2nd us horde on kt, but it’s hard to find facts on that now. Most kt kill lists don’t even have my guild listed.
---
I’m going back because vanilla is still the greatest game I’ve ever played and I’m going the same class, and this time I won’t lose my precious kt xbow from some shitty half assed expansion.
---
The Rhonin books are awful. Lord of the Clans was good
---
“Gonna try to get screen shot”
---
Yea old music is good, 60's and 70's were good times. Not nostalgia cause I wasn't born and it is definitely different than today. 
---
Thanks
---
Wait a month after classic release, it will get a bump from all the news, then buy some puts 2 months out. 
---
This is healthy. If you feel you should move on then do it. People here claim they arent stuck in the past yet then they go on to defend awful terrible game mechanics and have faulty memories of how the game really was. They have their role colored glasses on and dont want to admit it.
---
There is plenty to like about this game, but youre going to get extremely biased opinions from a bunch of 30 year old dudes trying to re-live their childhood.
---
Bandages are a thing, but their utility was effectively reduced to zero over time.
---
On my server only one person got it, it was a priest and they didn't finish it until BC although they did have a fair bit done pre-BC. No one on my server killed Kel'thuzad until after BC.
---
My group only ever got I think 4 bosses down if I remember correctly (Razuvious and the Spider Wing). Although overall I got to kill about 1/2-3/4 of the bosses pre-BC by helping out another raiding group.
---
So many of the mechanics got either watered down to the point of being trivial or flat out eliminated for the WotLK re-release and that doesn't even speak of how hard things hit. I remember razuviouses's shout would do all of your mana to you in damage if you got hit by it and faerlina's fire would kill me on it's 2nd tick. Noth teleported you to the eyeball room on occasion and loatheb required a raid wide healing rotation since casting healing spell put a minute long debuff on you before you could cast another one.
---
When I went back to help him finish it, bosses were still pretty hard even in BC early gear and the mechanics were still extremely relevant. Definitely wasn't something you could just cruise through even an expansion later.
---
I'm still kind of bitter that they removed the Naxx40 when WotLK pre-patch came out. I wish they could have if nothing else just moved the entrance to Caverns of Time. There was a lot of cool looking gear from there that wasn’t part of naxx25 or naxx10 that is now lost to the ages.
---
Well maybe we'll get to play together when the time comes (hope so, anyway), unless you're going to change things up and roll alliance, in which case I'll see you on the battlefield :P 
---
I believe first aid was combined with tailoring.
---
Technically older music is "mostly" better. There has never been a moment in history where Pop music (in all forms) has been more industrialized. 2 music writers write MOST of the Pop songs today you hear on the radio. Some dudes you never hear about. 
---
Music repetitive and formulaic and purposely so due to market research. Mass market entertainment on nearly all fronts is less sophisticated with less ability for independent competition. 
---
This is just modern reality. When you become the age of you parents, you may have the capacity of knowledge and perception to understand time does not mean evolution or progression. That is in fact the opposite of the true reality of how entropy works in the universe.
---
Same with gaming. It's been industrialized. It's why we are even talking about Classic. Older mmos may have been less technical ... but most still consider them better. How so do you ask? Because better technology does not mean the product is functionally better.
---
Inuit hunting skins still provide better insulation in freezing conditions. Sure they are heavy, smelly and require specific maintenance ... but they are functionally better for their purpose.
---
The magic that makes a game good is artistic. It is independent of technology. It can't be defined through metrics specifically. Classic Wow is more than Nostalgia. It gained notalgia because it was a good game. People play it because it's a good game. Private servers are loaded because it's a good game. Blizzard had to take control of the IP or risk losing control of older versions because it's a good game.
---
Hunter
---
I think the warrior is fun to level, even though it takes longer and is more tedious. Its exciting to push for that next weapon or piece of gear!
---
I dont think you get the point.  The stock is down currently.  I expect a large bump up after release.  That may or may not fade but if you buy now I expect to cash out a tidy some this fall.
---
After constant thinking about it for months I think I'm going to either go for a warrior or rogue. I don't have a ton of time for raiding, what with work and all, but would like to eventually.
---
Thoughts on choosing between those two?
---
My experience has been that when there are two groups in a party, a group of 4 and a group of 1, the 4 voices are louder and generally outweigh whatever the one said.
---
**Player1:** don't run with Scumbag Guild, they abuse loot trading
---
**Scumbag1:** Player1 is just mad because he lost on DPS
---
**Scumbag2:** And we wiped because he broke sheep (*important note: there was no mage in the run*)
---
**Scumbag3:** And he's mad because the healer let him die because he was hitting X instead of Skull
---
**Scumbag4:** And he kept pulling adds
---
Now Player1 sounds like a scumbag, even if it wasn't true, and Scumbag Guild sounds like legit players that Player1 was trying to flame in chat.
---
Dire Maul launched March 7, 2005. World first Rag kill wasn't until April 25, 2005. There was a two and a half month period between Domo getting dropped and Rag getting killed and in the middle of that DM was released. So simply put... Rag didn't die until a month after Dire Maul was out. 
---
Ahh yes. The spell power would make their arcane shots OP ;)
---
Always East is recruiting.  Our raids start at 8:15, so an hour later than you've specified, but everything else lines up with our values.  If you're interested here is a discord link - https://discord.gg/z4n7Vx if you want to check us out further or chat and see if it might be a good fit.
---
I may have 1-2 rl friends willing to return. They actually met through Wow and are married with child now. I am not sure if either one will however because they are married and have a child. lol
---
Sorry I couldn't find the proper thing
---
I have 1 friend confirmed to be returning. I have 3 more who have expressed interest.
---
They exist but their healing is pathetic and most classes will now have enough healing on their own to never need them
---
Assuming the math/sources for your WSG rep is correct then winning match for WSG and AB both take about 270 winning games to hit max rep. That is pretty cool
---
Why avoid playing it because you're afraid of being nostalgic? Moder wow has some better features and classic got some, classic will be more of an mmorpg compared to retail. You can like both, one or neither, it isn't all about nostalgia
---
Going warrior so I’m just going to go bs/mining, moreso cause why not and because weapons are so important for leveling it will allow me to craft weapons if I don’t get a drop.
---
Mining + Engineering to add tools to my Paladin's leveling toolbox.
---
Will likely go enchanting + alchemy at 60.
---
Skinning amd herbing then dropping skinning for arch at 60
---
[This one.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klm2Q7xu_d4)
---
Ok somebody else has beat me to it. It looks correct as far as I can tell. See their math here. However in their edit the give incorrect math on AB.

For a lot of people it's both.  There are some objectively good parts of vanilla compared to retail and there are also some parts that just haven't aged well.

Here's some of mine and my friends.

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhottROCynkuGH5a9ZVMJA1HCYOt48H_O
---
All the mage videos are me.  The warrior vids are from my guildmate Milt or from Lakineo from our rival guild (carried over from Dark Age of Camelot).
---
These are all genuine live videos from Illidan US.  Some of the clips are from before the Honor system was put in so probably patch 1.3.
---
My 3rd video (Top This III) has some interesting stuff near the end.
---
A few fights from one of the organized 5vs5 nights we had on a regular basis on the server.
---
That particular night the event was held in deadwind pass/swap of sorrows.  You can see the massive amount of spectators there were scattered all over the place, making things really crowded for the teams fighting.
---
Also my 3rd video I mostly used Rank 5 frostbolt since my gear was to the point where if I used max rank spells, then the clips were just boring and I 2 shot everyone like the Hunter LoL clip I threw in there, or the Priest that gets 2 shot in one of the 5vs5 clips.
---
I have some other vids that aren't on my youtube.  I'll upload them tonight if I remember.
---
This is actually the solution, right here.
---
It should go to a mage or warlock, what a failure.....  hihi
---
Elwynn forest here I come muahahahaha
---
I played Rogue in vanilla as my main. I don't specifically remember how easy/hard it was, but I do remember doing various Rogue only quests, such as poisons. And of course you have PvP, which Rogues excel at.
---
Very good album as well! But when i heard this song i instantly thought straight to playing wow back in the day 
---
Yea, TBH I don't remember rep being that hard to accumulate in Vanilla, but the Horde on my server also won 90% of PUG games (except in AV, we lost 99% of those) and I was exalted with WSG and AB relatively early on. I remember how pumped I was to get the AB boots because not only were they an upgrade for me, but that speed boost was really alluring. 
---
what helmet was that? I thought lionheart helm was best in slot even in naxx for warrior dps?
---
Looks like ill be in a similar situation. We're all in our early-mid 20s and everyone is either finishing up school or about to start a somewhat serious job. All of us are basically highschool friends except for 1 which is just one of my buddies from work.
---
Current comp:
---
\- Warrior 
---
\- Shaman
---
\- Rogue
---
\- Hunter
---
\- Mage (Me)
---
So actually pretty damn similar lol. I cannot wait, like you said not everyone will be able to no-life it, i know ill be working on roofs in the hot Chicago summer so ill be coming home dead tired but I'm determined to have a good good. Also like you said, it just about enjoying the game together, some of us played together back in like wrath-pandaria but we never have this group full together. Kinda wish we had a dedicated healer but i guess our shaman will have to take the reins on that, or i know our hunter was also considering going priest as well. Either way though I'm a big believer in everyone playing whatever they want that way we all just have fun. Can't wait. For the Horde!
---
Dude I used to PvP to this song as a paladin. Wreck bomb.com! 
---
Everything pales in comparison to warlocks summoning demons that aggor your own faction. 
---
You will see this on occasion in noob areas and AH.
---
Quit and start a new character
---
We’ve got a core group of about 5 confirmed to come back. Then possibly up to 10 as we convince people who used to play with us. All best irl friends. All of us share a mutual hatred for gnomes and if you  decide to play a gnome, may God have mercy on your soul because we will find you...
---
1) yes, sitting in my chair at launch moment
---
2) Yes. Goal is world 1st paladin or at least damn close
---
3) I have an in-depth exporation and fedex route to ten. Optimized grinding and (very few) quest route for 11-22. Moderately planned route for 22-30 - and a standard guide for 30+ the goal is to get to 30 asap to start the standard route with no competition.
---
4) Yes. And I have a backup to that backup. I've started putting together dungeon math to see if dungeons are valid to run if grinding spots are camped, or if quest areas are congested, etc. Whatever the case may be, I should know the expected XPH for all three options, and I'll pick whatever's the highest.
---
5) Yes. My last full run was 120 hours as a paladin. I've made a few changes, and can't test dungeon runs, some elite quests, etc - napkin math has my potential optimal run at 106 hours.
---

Hakkar
---
playing on a pserver, I do agree that Cthun is a bigger problem than most of naxx.   we have everything on farm, but Cthun can  still  wipe us on a bad day
---
that sounds super boring for your wife. At that point, with 0 challenge, leveling is the same as BfA for her.
---
I don't think blacklisting players works as good as people think, unless you really became notorious and pretty much a server celebrity for ninja looting. You can call ninjas out and maybe a few players will bother adding them to their ignore list but it'll hardly impact their chances of finding groups. Plus Blizz probably doesn't allow naming and shaming posts on their forums, so you won't be able to link proof.
---
You could have lower player caps so that they will iinevitabely be merged with managable player counts, you could you know get to terms with your mates **before** launch. 
---
And the benefits for the long run **is** that sharding is never in Classic and we have controll, and we have active realms with the mergers.
---
yes absolutely.   Especially in guilds that were not world first material.  If you are struggling, given the insane amounts of gold and (farm) time it required to buff up after each wipe.   You bet people go complain after a few weeks:  screw this, we have imba gear, we go PVP  for the remaining few months until  TBC, cya in WSG!
---
I think warlocks are the top tier trolls of their own faction. On top of demons, they can (or at least used to) summon players off ledges so that they fall to their deaths, and they can cast Curse of Recklessness on level 1 mobs in starting areas to wreck new players.
---
Same here I super feel like something is wrong with the stats I'm finding online. Even though I found comments from back in the day in 2006 that back up my numbers I wonder if something is missing. Even if the quests I mentioned in my OP can be repeated(there are several versions based on level) It would only gain as a whole 6k rep. (4 quests 500 rep each, 2k rep. 4 Quests 1k rep each for a total of 6k) It would only save 40 games which makes exalted still 230 games 
---
Damn, that's nice. I personally hope to latch onto a rl friend guild who hopefully accept me as someone interesting enough to join. Those guilds have always been the most fun to me. 
---
I have the least fun in power guilds, who may be organized, but have little to no loyalty and snipe 60s from other guilds instead of waiting for core levelers because they want to organize a raid sooner. This typically leads to the raid group slitting or the 2nd raid group splitting so guild drama is rampant and inevitable. A general overview of course.
---
Or simply fearing a mob you already tagged so it runs and attracts more mobs to overwhelm you.
---
I don’t understand why a company who offers their CEO a $15,000,000,000 signing bonus can’t afford enough customer support for their games. Fuck Activision. 
---
Is mining really worth while leveling? Seems like a lot of time investment for not that much gold.
---
What guild were you in? I played on Shadowsong as well, although I was a dwarf paladin. I did have some lower level Horde alts though.
---
Not really. There are always still a lot of people raiding at the end of xpacs now.
---
In a lot of cases, if you have Heroic or better raid gear, from the last tier (which is obtainable via weeklies, titanforging and other misc systems, without you ever setting foot in a Heroic raid) it will last you 8-10 levels. 
---
The game has worked like that since before Heroic raiding really. E.g.  my mage that was in mixed Sunwell/BT gear kept some pieces until level 80. Most were discarded between 76-78 or so. 
---
So, again, not really.
---
It was different with Vanilla since no one knew what to expect. 
---
I'll let you in on a secret. Most people here are already playing Vanilla Private Servers, and they love them. They just don't say it because of the implications. The nostalgia argument is clearly wrong to them. 
---
While the staff is decent i guess, it rly becomes the meta item in tbc with that sexy Kara port.
---
Play on one of the private servers and decide for yourself
---
My guild did Naxx 40 man runs with 25 - 35 people, in Bt/Sunwell gear, at 70 during TBC, in the last few weeks before WotLK dropped. 
---
It was somehow easier to do WotLK Naxx with 25 people in dungeon blues and old raid gear, than it was to do the 40 man version. 
---
I can't speak for fresh servers, but my experience has been that copper at least sells for around a gold or two per stack.  That's an average of 7 nodes to net a gold.
---
Typically you're grinding while you farm anyway.  It might slow down your leveling, but every dual gathering toon I've leveled has easily been able to buy all their skills (including riding) and buy gear off the AH.
---
After all these years, my mum still doesn't understand why we play these games, as adults that we are.  I'll email her your story. I am sure she will get it, she is the kind of woman who gets this kind of story.  I never could explain it in such majestic form as you just did. Thank you , Zouk!  
---
Do whatever you want, don't worry about *these* things.
---
I've never played the original. But I have played on private servers. I know it's a wonderful game which I can't wait to play.
---
Depends on what your raid needs tbh. If you need more healing you’ll give it to the priest. If you need big damage you’re gonna give it to the mage or warlock 
---
Rogue is maybe one step faster than warrior for leveling, but for every quest that is made easier with stealth the fact that you're a melee that has to fight mobs in lower armor makes it slower. You also need far more consumes on average if you're a melee dps and don't necessarily have the farming capabilities other classes have (though you still have some good options).
---
My bank alt recently got destroyed by an infernal.

That's a good way to troll a lot of players for a short time.  The methods I listed troll a specific player for a long time.
---
Ohhh qualcuno della vecchia guardia
---
This isn’t directly answering your question, but as I recall having a mage with Atiesh in your group allowed you to use other weps that would be stronger than Atiesh on its own. That is, on its own it was the best weapon a mage could use, but if you had a mage with Atiesh in your group, the sword and off-hand from Naxx would be more powerful while you’re getting the 2% crit buff from your Atiesh wielder.
---
Ok. I play on a private server too. I am nostalgic for this game and i love it too. I never said no one actually enjoys this game but i am saying tons of people arent honest with themselves about why and knee jerk get defensive when its pointed out that theyre biased.

Chinese farmers will hit the servers in about a month.

"There is a certain beast that doesn’t live in snow  
---
Nor mountain lands nor jungle vales nor in the sea you know  
---
He wanders thriving grasslands and travels rolling plains  
---
And is known by the Tauren as the great kodo  
---
He’s got a massive horn and a sturdy rugged back  
---
Can bear a Tauren or some baggage piled up in a stack  
---
There is no other creature that can bear the Tauren weight  
---
For they’d give other beasts a heart attack  
---
No raptor mount or skelly horse or riding wolf will do  
---
For they are only adequate for cooking in a stew  
---
The kodo may be hungry and destroy your pumpkin farm  
---
But the clumsy hungry kodo has a certain kind of charm  
---
I just casually level the second character when I need a break from the main but do try not to waste too much rest xp. 
---
Druid as feral is a good character for this. Playing one 1st would likely get me a 60 slightly faster than a shaman but as an alt, it is a superior grinder (ferals are one of the best for that) and it allows me to not rely so much on quest chaining (which doesn't double xp with rest xp) and maximize mob grinding for double rested xp.
---
This makes me ponder whether to have skinning on the druid to but I think it's better money on they shaman as it will hit heavy and better leathers earlier, which is where the money is.
---
I would put cozy fires everywhere for all the slow people running to the raid. Then we would tell stories in vent around it
---
A guild who manages to actually make  Atiesh is probably doing fine. Its really more about whos the most committed imo, just like with Rags hammer. Thunderfurry is the only legendary that should clearly go to the main tank.
---
Mining/Skinning for leveling then dropping skinning for Eng.
---
There really aren't that many keybind issues as a shaman. You're not going to be using most the totems while in world or in dungeons/raids, you just make sure to have the spells you need on your bar for those two different modes of play. You also end up being able to do some of the best support pvp as a shaman and Tauren in particular is the only version with any CC.
---
Plus, for me, the fact that the race is modeled after a hodgepodge of native North American culture just sort of lends itself thematically towards being a shaman a lot more.
---
Yes it does. It's arguably the best pvp racial in the game but since all the hardcore pvp players end up going Horde it's underrated.
---
The pain of having a PC that locked up for a couple seconds every time the level up animation occured. 
---
It was really dumb too because it basically got that reputation because people from other servers made alts just to go there anonymously. I don't care how you get your wanks, I really don't, be a cat-girl with a penis for all I care, but other people do care and the looks I'd get when I'd tell other people I was on Moon Guard was really irritating.
---
this is the same argument used when loot trading was proposed on retail. this very seldom happens though. its an extremely rare drawback for something that can seriously help fix shitty mistakes.
---
I agree. The whole post was poorly constructed. A statement, as a software dev, I shouldn't have to make about someone whose job is written communication. /sigh.
---
Even with "right" itemization which some of pserevers tried to reproduce, mc and bwl are jokes in 2019, I see a lot of guild recruiting spam on some pserver and they are all doing sub 40min bwl and mc.
---
They're all pretty balanced. What is technically best probably depends on your exact comp and goal but it's not going to be a huge difference either way.
---
Maybe, but we did actually play vanilla the first time (got up to the first handful bosses in Naxx40 before guild implosion over irrelevant atiesh shards).  She also might or might not have played somewhere that sounded similar to dorth nale once upon a time, so she's experienced it all before.  
---
Plus we're doing a warrior/pally do with her as the warrior.....can you imagine how smooth it would be to level a warrior not having to warrior about gear or whether you can finish an elite quest?  The main goal here would be to get her as caught up to me as possible as quickly as possible, so that we can make huge economic gains leveraging a tank+heal dungeon as everyone's rushing to get pre-bis.
---
&gt; and they can cast Curse of Recklessness on level 1 mobs in starting areas
---
lol I never tried that :D  
---
Hit rating in vanilla??  188.5% crit chance?
---
Camp the crossroads all day every day
---
Engineering gives you a ranged pull as a paladin and makes you nigh-unkillable in wpvp while leveling. It's also pretty much essential for pvp. Once you're at endgame herbalism scales a lot better as a farming source than mining, as people still need the items throughout the lifetime of the game. BS is honestly never really gonna make you much money.
---
Should be a level 5 brawl there on day 1 
---
very good blizzard
---
&gt; The extra int from being Gnome is a miniscule benefit that you won't even notice
---
It ends up being like .5% crit in even just bwl gear though. That's reasonably noticeable.
---
Can’t decide if this is more fun than camping the crossroads
---
I remember it being nearly impossible to get anywhere at more then half a frame per second in ironforge and other major cities
---
While classic db is a good site, it is still the database of a private server (an old one). It will most likely not be the same as retail.
---
So, do you present the disenchant icon for the group if there is an enchanter there?  Or is that person free to secretly need roll a few greens and de for themselves?
---
Or you could both go BM hunters lol. 
---
I remember me and a friend were in a 5 man Inner Mara run as a pair of level 40'ish hunters, and we were both getting yelled at by the tank to stop pulling aggro off him, which we didn't see as a big deal because we were absolutely destroying mobs in seconds so it would've been slower to do it his way. It wasn't even reckless either, he just didn't like not being in control. 
---
The 2 other people in the group were with him and they all left the party. So me and my friend continued without them and downed every boss in the dungeon, even Princess. We weren't sure we could do it absolutely just the two of us, but because we were put into the position, why not try. And we did! To make it more awesome, we actually finished the dungeon before the other group found 2 replacements and made their way through according to the /who check. If only they stuck with us :P
---
It was so much fun to play the game that way though, we utilized our pets so much keeping them up with mend or straight dpsing enough to kill before our pets died. Strategic feign deaths, and pet aggro rotations etc. I bet warlock and mage would be a great duo too. Or anything with a feral druid. There's bound to be another duo that was as good as our duo BM hunters were!
---
Looking at that action bar almost sent me into a seizure, does no one else group all like-spells together ( Fire, Ice, Arcane, Utility, Debuff ) or is that level of OCD just me, I literally wanted to shift click move the spells on my screen.
---
I once got docked 50 DKP for “opening up a fucking portal to Darnasus in the middle of a lava pack right next to the warlocks” 
---
That was a fun day. 
---
Mix the red, green and blue, it's super effective and comes with a buff that helps on boss fights.
---
ALLIANCE warrior or warlock?
---
So im gonna play alliance and i never played wow before. I tried all classes on a server and i could narrow my picks to warlock and warrior.
---
However as an alliance warlock i kinda fear undeads that i will be in a huge disadvantage. As well as farming soul shards im nit sure whst to expect.
---
As a warrior im afraid of lvling not just it will be slow but warrior in worldpvp is weaker than a mob i guess especially if someone hits me after i finished a mob or whilefighting one.
---
Other class opinions:
---
Really like paladins but retri dont have any attacking abilities? Maybe one
---
Hunter is too hard for me pet, kiting, arrows, traps etc..
---
Mage, i dont like casters. Warlock has so many instant abilities and a pet.
---
Rogue, i really like rogue but it lacks of gap closer and i dont like the sneaky style. Im more of a going in face type.
---
Druid- very cool and lot of sides but not my class
---
So any tips on alli warlock or warrior? Would warlock be that baf against undeads?
---
Yeah the lionheart helm is still BiS, this is the T2.5 helm from AQ40 though. Not sure why I didn't use lionheart, probably didn't realize it was that much better at the time, or just preferred the stamina/the look of the AQ40 one lol.
---
I'm the same, I'm all for make that $$$, shit drop 20 whale squeezing mobile games a year if thats what you want to do but I still expect high quality PC games and the fact that shit seems to have dried up and ended is I think why so many people are pissed theyre shifting focus to cash grab mobile bullshit.
---
&gt;level 60 character with BIS gear of your choice while everyone else is level 1 - How do you wield this power?
---
Spend an hour or two healing for random people every day, spend most of my time hanging out in tradechat.
---
Everybody loves me. Become famous. Start guild.
---
Have an easy time becoming Scarab Lord because so many people on the server remember how much I helped them out.
---
Everybody wins.
---
Wait what? Why would you play a priest instead of mage? But yes, I have my old 4 IRL friends and we have been making plans since the announcement. We even ran a few test runs on pservers and planned a few routes to save us some time in the lower zones to get ahead. We have all been playing since actual vanilla and we can't be more hyped.
---
Our setup:
---
Warrior (Tank obviously, constant WF for extra threat and easier pulls)
---
Shaman (Resto, provides WF along with other good totems, chain heal and self ress)
---
Rogue (Simply just the best solid single dpser there is if he gets his pieces, constant WF aswell which will make him super deadly)
---
Mage (Good dps, can sheep and provide free food/water for everyone)
---
Warlock (Decent dps, can summon people and provide HS/SS for survivability along with fear for panic pulls)
---
Confirmative, its pretty full :p
---
AI in 2019. We’re not there yet
---
Warlocks&gt;Mages&gt;Priest ATM 
---
Haha it's fine. It's nice to see that not everyone knows the game. It means there will be skill differences. A huge element of online rpg is the different ranks of player skill and achievement. 
---
I will have saved 250 BTO hours by July. at 8 hours a day thats 31.25 days off. Subtract Saturdays and Sundays for normal days off I can take off 5.2ish weeks. My boss of course said no I cant take off over a month to relive the greatest time of my life so I'm just going to take off 2 weeks, work a week then take another 2. Should get a lot done and be able to casually no life it.
---
Warlocks
---
Summon Inferno
---
Dismiss him
---
Banish him
---
Infinite aoe damage at AH, bank, etc.
---
Priests may not be able to farm dme on classic. I played a priest on retail vanilla and none on my server did it. Maybe we didn’t know about it, but it might also be due to lashers having higher spell resist or hp than on private servers. I have not found any video of priest farming dme on retail vanilla. 1st boss in dm north I know for a fact that priest could do (as i did it). Princess in mara is also easy to farm as a priest. That was how I made enough gold for my epic mount in retail classic.
---
lionheart was also super expensive, I remember saving a few hundred gold over several months of play and feeling stoked to be able to afford one. 
---
Come to think of it, a BR mod of WoW would be kind of cool!
---
Think of it: people airdrop onto a random part of the map, then they have to kill mobs, run quests, gear up, and level up to challenge other players. One by one, zones become engulfed in fire, so people need to move onwards from time to time.
---
Eventually, players would convene on a single zone and have to duke it out to be the last one standing
---
The world would have to be scaled (over time, not on individual progress) to accompany the pace of the game.
---
Such matches might take a few hours, but they could implement fast movement speed, early mounts, rapid XP, etc.
---
If you enjoy killing gnomes, we may have a home for you
---
I didn't raid in Vanilla.  Can you tell me why this was so bad?
---
I did raid a lot in TBC, WotLK, and Cata (a little bit in MoP).  Here's what I remember from those:
---
*I always hearthed after raids.  But I remember mages setting up Portal Roulette by hitting every single portal button and people would wind up in random places.  (Stonard was the best).
---
*I'd get a Shaman or DK to hit Water Walk or Frost Nova on the way down to Anub'Arak in ToC.  If you were smart you would dive.  We did this every week.  My GM yelled at me every week.  (We had one hunter with a potato PC that would hit the ground before her PC registered the water and die from fall damage, even if we weren't doing this.)
---
*One thing we didn't ever do, but I really wanted to, was have 2-3 DKs spec blood on Valithria Dreamwalker.  They had a talent that would give someone a damage boost but cause them to take 30% of their health as damage.  I wanted to see our GMs reaction to the boss repeatedly dying in just a minute due to these buffs.  She was horrible at diagnosing wipes and it would have been hilarious.  I'm gonna hold that on the backburner for if we do get a WotLK server.
---
Ah so the atiesh staff user would kind of be a support buffer for another mage ? That’s pretty interesting 
---
why would DKP have anything to do with this?
---
good thing phasing won't be a thing.
---
"staycation, going to try to get some things done around the house and relax"
---
Mats is still making an impact in the world, both worlds. His story touched stirred up so many emotions within me; I mourned his passing; I regret not meeting him; I rejoiced at the relationships he formed and I celebrate the life of a man who left a positive legacy. 
---
I think back now to all those I've met through wow and wish I had remained in contact with more of them. I hope they are all living well and I thank them for sharing a part of themself with me. 
---
Beautiful story full of beautiful people.
---
Thank you
---
This is what PvP it's all about! I'm surprised (or actually given what Blizzard is doing recently not really) that Blizzard didn't push this idea further... like open world free-for-all PvP battles.
---
3400AP oof
---
&gt; casually 
---
&gt; no life it
---
pick one
---
I would play it too. But you know it would be filled with micro transactions BS.
---
Yea and unless they have access to a T3 grilled out best in slot warrior tank. They gonna be shining my car for coins. Shit I'll really be (ooc) buying peoples souls for gear. I'll be writing out them Faustian contracts not even knowing if the after life is real. On the off chance it is though. My army of nerds will take over a spot for me.
---
That would be amazing,
---
No, training points is just: (loyalty level - 1) x pet level
---
The hit rating was just a tally of your +% hit stats, I think it was 1% = 10 points. The crit chance is wonky because of all the buffs and procs during the fight, probably why I took the screenshot in the first place 
---
Very touching!! I vote for making Mats a NPC in wow classic. In Goldshire!
---
This is a bit misleading.  many hunters are farming alts or (casual) solo players, since hunter is  a great class for that kind of play style. 
---
So you do indeed encounter a lot of hunters  while idling in Iron Forge or Orgrimmar, it's easy to think the class is overpopulated. But as far as lvl 60 raiding is concerned , there are a lot less hunters.  we sometimes had trouble finding enough,  on the various journeys from MC to Naxx I have witnessed in the past years 
---
It’s much easier to pay a hunter for the few items you need and farm DM with a healer.
---
I remember on my first character, awarrior around level 20 in redridge, trying to help a hunter kill a boar.  He got so mad at me.  Turns out he was trying to tame it and I was fucking it up for him.
---
&gt;Fuck rouge players
---
Whats with the hate for players that use rouge? Not everyone has naturally rosey-red cheeks ya know :p
---
They’ll probably put it into Retail, since it’s been so trendy.  
---
In case you're serious, the joke in OP is that monks aren't in classic. 
---
Druids, in my opinion, are AWESOME. I leveled 2 classes to 60 in classic: Mage and Druid. Druid was way WAY more fun, even though I leveled in balance spec when feral would have been way easier to level as (my best friend was playing as feral druid so I leveled as balance to be different). 
---
Several things make Druid amazing:
---
1. Moonglade and class quests. You basically have an entire zone dedicated to your class specifically, and a bunch of lore along with that. 
---
2. Versatility. Leveling up in classic is about the journey, not about the destination. So if you have balance gear you can hop in a dungeon and heal or dps, and if you have feral gear you can dps or tank (though not as effectively as warriors can tank). 
---
3. You are GOD in WSG 30-39 bracket due to travel form.
---
4. Travel form means farming for your eventual mount isn't as painful. 
---
5. Each of your specs is fun to play and totally different (although only heals are viable in raids, that much is true. If you're lucky, raids might take a single boomkin for the aura). 
---
I would definitely recommend if you haven't played a druid before. 
---
Dream on
---
I just think it’s interesting how many folks on this subreddit assume this will be a common scenario.
---
Most guilds can just have their own 5 mans. No need to put a random stranger. 
---
It’s aslo interesting how many people assume that, when this comes up, it’s only going to be to your detriment. E.g. maybe that 4 person guild group is running for a single item that you can even equip. So they just pass stuff you need to you. 
---
I understand the concern but any group serious about having absolute control over dungeon drops won’t be bringing pugs. 
---
&gt; You have basically no reason to play the game except to carry this guild who is paying you
---
You know to raid, to compete for realm first kills and the sense of accomplishment that comes from that.
---
&gt;WoW is about the journey, not the destination.
---
Right because we take screenshots of that first black lotus picked, dinging 33 and our bags full of rugged leather. Oh wait, no! it's boss kills and hitting 60.
---
RPG elements in an MMO? But that'll just confuse the casual players.. probably best to just get rid of it.
---
I don't consider that noticeable. It's also an overestimate. A warlock at that gear level will have around 300 int when fully raid buffed. Gnomes get +5% int and every 60 int is about +1% crit, so that's 0.25% extra crit.
---
god i hope this was me. feel the rage. 
---
This ain’t no country club either.
---
This is L.A.
---
This is brilliant, I hope like 10-20 people have the same idea so we get a glorious all starter gear sinister-strike off
---
RIP mats.
---
Damn OP I didn't come to this sub for these kind of feels.
---
Well I consider it casual when also mess with professions and talk in trade chat instead of bee lining straight to 60 but since i'll average 12 hours a day on WoW I consider it no life it. Not doing anything else or being productive.
---
Answer me honestly. How much better would classic have been if you could open a portal to Orgrimarr or Stormwind?.\
---
&lt;angry no-change statement&gt;
---
Bow skills.
---
Staff skills.
---
Frostbolt skills.
---
They only like guys with great skills!
---
Please no group/raid queue for AV. The fun of the "battle" goes away completely when players are focused on farming honor and try to rush it to the end. Having large preforms makes it too easy.
---
anybody with a nividia 970(maybe even older not sure when they started doing it) or newer basically has shadowplay by default
---
Log out, delete the char and start over.
---
I did this on a wotlk private server except i levelled my future twink to lvl 10 to get stealth and sap. The first 2 day were almost uncontested (just killed some lvl 1 that had almost the same idea). After 3 day some leveller started to came but i still managed to get most chest by sapping them while they were trying to loot it and taking it while they were stunned (doesn't work if he has a insignia or a pet tho).
---
I like Onny. I love the story leading up to it and the fact that everyone is usually a bit sub geared at the time. Plus its a big as dragon! Really makes you feel as if you are in the world of warcraft.
---
Now, since we are in a classic subreddit I guess you want pre Classic WoW Lore that is not retconned to death by Blizz. So basically the original Warcraft books.
---
This is the reading order I'd recommend:
---
The Last Guardian
---
Day of the Dragon
---
Lord of the Clans
---
War of the Ancients trilogy
---
Cycle of Hatred
---
Now, the reason I recommend reading The War of the Ancients trilogy after the other Warcraft books, even though it takes place mostly 10000 years before them, is that there are parts of the trilogy that take place after the other Warcraft books. More specifically they take place between Reign of Chaos and Frozen Throne. That's when Rhonin, Broxigar and Krasus go back in time
---
Cycle of Hatred is the only book that is a World of Warcraft book instead of a Warcraft book. I'd still recommend it since it leads up to Classic WoW pretty well.
---
For me its Onyxia for sure. I remember walking into her lair and see her lie there all big and mighty. The atmosphere in there was fantastic! :)
---
My best memory from vanilla. 
---
I kinda agree. I prefered Lord of the Clans and The Last Guardian over The War of the Ancients trilogy and Day of the Dragon. 
---
The music in AQ always gets me. Doesn't have anything to do with the boss, maybe in a way, but music imo plays a huge part. I'd like to cite Karazhan. That place was just an absolute joy. The endbosses/raiding is the reason I play - the raiding, group cohesiveness, the gear, etc. - no other game ever had that large scale group decision-making at that level imo. I &lt;3 Vanilla
---
A guy showed a screenshot from vanilla here the other day and he had some Warlock targeted who was named Drazzoth and I had that exact thought.
---
"Man I miss when RPG names were more common and dope."
---
Never realized how much that increases immersion. 
---
Take this as an honest question not a cutting remark masquerading as one. Is there a point to this? I guess I am just asking why?
---
It's not about the butt, it's about the wrist. Get a chair high enough that when you sit comfortably, your elbow is higher than your wrist.
---
"Unpopular opinion but..."
---
I remember my mage hitting 60 in vanilla...my first toon. I was just as retarded with key bindings. From memory I have Frost Nova bound to the = key haha. No doubt I used max rank also

Just to respond as best I can, as a founder of CWL, to the amount of quality constructive criticism we are receiving concerning classicwow.live on this thread.
---
The website, as it is now, is just a launch page. We are currently hard at work on a fresh 2.0 system that will include guide (both written and video) sorting and integration, tools, database and forums. The streamer feel you may be getting was a rough interpretation of our mission late last year. We are currently shifting to a community based website that will evolve via community input. Considering of the founding members, only myself, Defcamp, and Kargoz are content creators, the actual majority of us are theorycrafters, technicians and tool developers. We want a healthy mix of all aspects of what is Classic WoW.
---
Many of you concerned about ads may want to consider how much overhead a site like this incurs. Ads are a necessary evil, at least for the foreseeable future to keep the website up and running. Forums and databases cost money. There may be other forms of fundraising like patreon but we don't want to ask the community for money. This is a start-up after all.
---
Be on the lookout for more coming this month or the beginning of next month. If you have any more questions, please let me know
---
I would pick a Druid
---
Farm arcane crystals, purple lotus. I cant farm leather on top of these but I think these two things long terms will make more money. 
---
I would then be the best tank for guilds once they start hitting 60.  Fully BIS Feral tank is really beefy, the best part of that vs a full BiS warrior is threat is less of an issue for a druid. DPS while in progression would be able to as hard as they wanted as I'd never lose threat. 
---
blocking ads by element picker should be standard for everyone, to bad so many people are simply unaware
---
The only lore appropriate class/race combo I miss is human hunter, though I probably wouldn't even play it due to shitty racials.
---
Real controversial bud. Totally not preaching to the choir that is the echo chamber of this sub...
---
Why do people hate the idea of being able to sell coins in classic? I get the hate of sharding I share it in fact. Sharding would be the one thing that would make me go. Well Blizz sorry but no, not interested. 
---
That being said. Why all the hate for coins? I haven't played since they were added but being able to farm gold in game to play seems okay to me. Other then a gold sync whats the problem? 
---

"Claiming this circlejerk is an unpopular opinion..."

This video seems to be mainly about modern WoW, so I've removed it as per Rule #1 (posts need to be about Classic). There's plenty of room to argue about phasing (sharding being the correct term for Classic), but this post doesn't really present any argument beyond showing a BFA clip.

Lot of people have the capability. No one wants to do it. Issues happen so rarely it’s not worth the energy for people. Just because you know how it works doesn’t mean other people should and should have to use it
---
happy cake day
---
That's a good idea 
---
Youre just going to buy all the ore since you hate alting? Geez. We got a masochist over here.
---
Skinning and enchanting of course 
---
I will be sitting on a 15$ walmart folding chair. It's the only thing that will remind me I have been playing for three hours so far today. If I used a comfy chair I would be on hour 65 and still not notice my GF left me lol.
---
And you will run to the forums, and the guy will post in response that the item was an upgrade for him and he was entitled to roll on it, but wanted his epic mount more. So he decided to sell it to you. Everyone shrugs and moves on with their day. Loot selling is going to be rampant. 
---
If they are well connected with a top raiding guild nobody is going to care what they do to random lower level PuGs. 
---
I love fork knife 
---
Training Points cap out at 300 at level 60 and loyalty level 6.
---
This is a bit something else, since it's not how to annoy your own faction but rather things people might not know they can do to annoy the other faction in goblin cities (neutrail cities)
---
There is a ton of speels like, sap, frost trap etc that you can use to slow the enemy faction out.
---
However my favorite is honestly priest. Everyone should know that if u kill someone on the booty bay boat it doesn't really matter since they still get transported. However as a priest you can mindcontrol them and make them jump out of the boat. This is my favorite for so many reasons. The best timing is to do it when he is pretty far out of booty bay, because the run back for him is so long he has to make the run twice (one time he will die from fatigue again) so he will have to wait not just for "the boat to get back" but from the boat one more time. You can litterly make a guy waste 20-30 mins just from mindcontroling him out of the boat at the right time. My favorite was when i was the boat on a priest with 3x people that were lower lvl then me, managed to make 3 of them jump out of the boat with mindcontrol, after the 3rd one an alliance killed me, but it doesn't matter if u die on the boat since u still get teleported :D
---
They already announced this during blizzcon. Surprised you missed it.
---
Vael the Guild breaker. The lore is neat, but the real reason I love him is that feeling you got, back in the day, finally beating that jerk after so many tries. Required switching through tanks, calls of "run to the corner dammit" before you blew up. Looking back on it, it was awesome.
---
As someone who normally leads DPS. This is a lie. DPS meters are for neck bearded trolls and try hard teen age boys. People that talk about it or gear score are absolutely unfuckingbearable. The best memories from classic were taking our little pups and training them into proper soldiers. Not screaming at them while linking meters. 
---
Even in dungeons back in the day. I would never link a meter. I would look at it. See what they were doing wrong and gradually train them up. Even if they were a random pug. Community is what made this game great. Theres a reason why people still talk about it 15 years later. No one wants to hear about your dumb ass little meters.
---
Fair point. I really just want the tauren to be special somehow. First we lose plainsrunning, then they saddle^1 us with these ugly lizard-phant *things* for a mount. At least make 'em exclusive.
---
^1
---
Pun fully intended.
---
Was he a gnome? It's always the gnomes!!!
---
It’s never worth it to play a character you don’t like the looks of imo. You will be staring at this character for years possibly. 
---
The only case where I may disagree is for priest. Having fear ward as a dwarf priest is probably worth it over human/nelf. 
---
Yeah, how dare they play a spec that was built for damage. Can't expect every warrior to tank every time... Longer waits for a group are part of the territory but that's their problem, not yours. :P
---
DAE want updated models and karazhan?  Unpopular opinion time guise! 
---
Use my 60 priest in BiS to power level the warrior on my second account.
---
Thanks for the reminder to add "take a screenshot every time your character levels" to my list of addons when Classic launches.
---
Thanks for the excellent formatting and videos! I'll check them out. 
---
Sweet thanks!
---
Yeah. Now when I try to find vanilla content on there its really difficult. 
---
Thanks! I'll check it out.
---
Wow original content! Thanks! I'll check it out. 
---
Yea i agree. Chili von carne is quickly made &amp; you can make big amounts without problems. Definitely high up on my list lol
---
It would be somewhat pay to win. Epic mount can give you a big advantage in PvP. Normally that's a 100 hours of gold grinding. Now it's X real dollars. There are quite a few exceptional BoE items that normally cost a lot of gold. Think Lion Heart Helm, Edgemasters, Darkmoon necklace. Coins turn these into pay to win epics. 
---
Am I the only one that.......
---
Oh dang that'd be an awesome addon!
---
I always wanted to be a Tauren Warlock. Exclusively because of the shoulder armor graphics. No one wears shoulders like a Tauren.
---
For a lot of people leveling is already 0 challenging (and super boring as it is). Getting boosted through 1-60 so I can get to the end game would be a godsend.
---
You have to realize different people find enjoyment from different things. Just because you'd find a super boost from 1-60 boring doesn't mean others will. Alternatively I fully acknowledge that getting boosted from 1-60 wouldn't be for everyone and for some people it would indeed be boring.
---
with priests, wait until he starts hitting on a mob and damaging it some, then use psychic scream and fear the mob into the group of his friends. I've always liked to call it "enhanced pulling".
---
then there's the silent stalker method - mind vision. you can cast it as long as you're in the same continent and it shows up amongst their debuffs, so they'll know you're watching. 
---
I might have used it to the effect of schizophrenia, sending random whispers to a certain fuckwit, criticizing his performance and making fun of him, eventually getting a few friends (whom he similarly pissed off) to fuck with him by sheeping mobs and just generally being dicks... y'know, the usual.
---
*never fuck with a priest.*
---
I’d like it if they increased the level cap and added some new zones 
---
The only difference between keeping a pet leveled with you until 60 vs a leveling a low level pet as a level 60 is one option may lead to insanity or questioning the value of your mortality.
---
Okay maybe I don't understand how these coins work. Are you saying you buy the coins with cash? Then sell them to other players for gold? If thats the case I get what you mean. Yea I won't be playing if they have that.
---
My friends have weird vendettas against WoW.  I'm probably gonna be rolling solo until I find a guild.  
---
But I still don't know how to cement a place in the guild.  Guilds always seem to be centered around two cliques of people that know each other either for a long time or IRL.
---
The real game is different for different people. I always roll me eyes when people like you proclaim "your" way is the right way.
---
It's July 16. I'm shocked that it seems like the majority don't know this.
---
Yes it's not confirmed, so it could be delayed. But that's when Blizzard is planning to release the game and they were confident enough to leave the easter eggs in the Blizzcon demo so people could work out the date.
---
I think you linked your playlist. I'm getting a video for Euringer "What a Fool Believes" if I click the "Play" arrow on desktop.
---
It’s a neat idea but a lot of the TBC infrastructure is based on flying. Tempest Keep is inaccessible without it. Hell, most of Netherstorm is inaccessible without flying.
---
You forgot the last step which was get instabanned for griefing!
---
Also from these guys "if you get ganked just get your friends".
---
Pick one, hypocrites.
---
[The quintessential vanilla warrior PVP video.](https://youtu.be/RGBnjELkgok?t=142)
---
&gt;If you don’t want DM our at release then we shouldn’t have Mara at release either
---
I get what you are trying to say, that both instances affect 60 gear and both were released later in the game, but there's still a fairly big difference, DM adds way way more gear into the game and it's not really a "leveling dungeon". There's a reason why pservers usually have mara at launch but not DM. 
---
Making it possible to see enemy buffs at all times still ranks pretty highly in terms of worst PvP changes for me.
---
how is he an asshole for complaining about people spamming the same question instead of just searching for an answer? 
---
Are the dwarf rogue stats correct? When comparing humans to dwarves there was a difference of like 40 points allocated to agility, which dwarves made up for in significantly more stamina and strength.
---
I'm not sure if they're right or not- but if they are that's crazy.
---
I don't run mine for ninjas in particular, but you never know when something hilarious is gonna happen, I have captured so many great moments with my friends over the years I can't imagine not doing it nowadays. 
---
I mean at the end of the day to each their own, but if you are worried about people 4v1ing you about ninja looting/loot trading it might be something worth looking into.
---
Hi, /u/FormalSwordfish
---
As a mage my two favorite pranks to pull are:
---
1) Yell “portals to IF” in raid, and achtuaaallly make a portal to darnassus. This is easily fixed, so it’s ALWAYS fun to do.
---
2) play with people you don’t know and dress like a warlock. Yell in raid “summoning xxx player” and then make a portal somewhere. That’s a great way to port 10 people out of a raid AND get yourself kicked in the process!
---
I always roll my eyes when people like you can’t recognize an opinion after starting their sentence with “The game is different for different people.”
---
Yes. They aren't a good sink where your gold goes poof. Someone's pays $20 for the gold that you paid in for the coin. The gold price is determined by supply and demand.
---
Yeah that's really cool as well.
---
To me there are two different "parts" of it: either the one you said, or some less serious ones that are still pretty timeless. Still remember meeting "Frankthetank" back in vanilla and thinking that was a really cool name.
---
Human race starting zone. Harvesting berries makes them disappear for everyone, so you just anticipate where the player is heading for and snatch their harvest.
---
Ironforge you mountain climb up to the arch then summon random people through the portal and they fall to their death. 
---
Did you raid enhancement with Nightfall or did you have to go Resto to join the raid?
---
Was kind of enjoying till this gem "Just go Orc. Tauren is not worth it." kinda shows he knows nothing about shaman as Tauren is hands down better for rest and ele. Orc is only if you wanna be LOLFURY!!
---
You also said Orc over Tauren for shamans. Which is just objectively wrong. For Resto and ELE Tauren is 100% better and for enhance it's debatable. Orc's make worse shamans then Tauren. 
---
It makes it waaaaay easier.
---
We have a guild on our part we called &lt;AGGRESSIVE IDIOTS&gt;. It’s exactly as advertised. You’ll get kicked from the guild if you don’t use all caps in guild chat apparently. The whole point of the guild is to gank lowbie horde and “NOT BE A CUCK”. 
---
It’s kind of hilarious honestly, in a “it’s so bad I can’t look away” kind of way.
---
I want to play a clothie. In wotlk I played spriest, and I really like the idea of melting faces. In addition the ability to heal dungeons was a plus for me. Should I play another spriest in classic, or switch it up and play a warlock? For perspective I played a necromancer in guild wars. 
---
I'm also envious of mages, considering their mobility and free drank. 
---
I will be pvp focused btw. 
---
I play a rogue so bars are pretty bare compared to the rest of the classes. Lucky that way.
---
I'm gonna have a lot of work to do here and habit breaking and making lol. It will be worth it though. Always is 😋
---
He doesnt have any though. Except maybe polymorph.
---
There were several that did exactly this back in the day. 'Course, I didn't know about them until long after I'd started playing, and all the screens have long since been lost to multiple HDD failures.
---
I'm really looking forward to getting to document my characters' journeys to max level this time around. Even though it'll be a good while until any of 'em get there, the way I'll be playing.
---
There are portals already on Netherstorm. 
---
Your comment was phrased as a fact, not an opinion. I'm sorry English is difficult for you.
---
There already are addons for it and it is great. Let the people who want 4 day long mindless zerg fests in mid do their thing, let guilds who want to coordinate 40 people to accomplish goals queue together. 
---
Nothing about what I said implied it was any more than how I felt about something. You just disliked that I don’t agree with you.
---
Be cool if instead of weapons you pick up different spells. Could lead to some stupid fun combinations 
---
Screen guy is fire. check that combustion at 8
---
haha who would wanna be a silly priest, religion is dumb aren't I right guys ;) only girls play healers, "I mean, yea I'm rolling priest but for personal reasons"
---
Fucking Christ bro and these clowns can't figure out why they down to less then four million subs...
---
Thank you. That is amazing.
---
Grats!!
---
I want the same so bad....but all of my friends wont play wow again :((((
---
Incorrect, I simply read your comment and responded to it. If you wanted to indicate it was your opinion you should have included something like "In my opinion", "To me" etc. You didn't and as such your comment was a blanket statement about the what the "real" part of Classic is.
---
I really couldn't care less if the leveling is the real game for you.
---
I might have a stalker or two, every now and again a post like that which is inoffensive in tone and makes factually sound points gets hit with inexplicable downvotes.
---
It turns out pirate WoW players are sometimes a bit socially maladjusted and sometimes have a lot of time on their hands. Who could have seen that coming?
---
I would say DKP knows exactly who deserves the loot. I have never had a situation where loot council worked out well. I am sure it can in theory. That being said I look at loot council the same way I look at communism. Cool dream bro, but keep it the fuck off my lawn lol.
---
I distinctly remember the first time our guild made it through that painful tunnel of trash mobs between Twin Emps and C'thun.  When you finally get there and see the light from his room shining out into the hallway, and then you carefully take a peek inside, it's such an "oh shit this is it" moment.  Not my screenshot but this is what I'm talking about:
---

---
"The only argument against the auto-ban system is that it will stop you from saying edgy racial and homophobic slurs, but that's a different discussion." 
---
I think you meant the strongest argument for. 
---
Haha yea some classics are dope tbh. 
---
Its cool that Naxx was actually released almost year and a half after this :)
---
The only reason people say “in my opinion” and “To me” is because they don’t want to deal with people like you. I assure you the majority of the people who read my comment knew it was my opinion.
---
For some reason I think a Dwarf Rogue is super cool, probably the coolest Rogue Race even. Thoughts? 
---
As a MT.  I loved Razorgore.  Having to grab aggrieved and kite was such a blast 
---
Why not make a 10-minute Youtube video about it? I'm sure we'd all be thrilled to watch and subscribe.
---
Loot trading is hot garbage and will definitely lead to ninja looting and gear hostage situations. It's human nature.
---
NO CHANGES.
---
Q is also my universal interrupt and t for pots. Good to see i'm not the only one who uses this sort of system
---
Can you message me what he said? I kinda really need to know now lol!
---
It's an old UI sir, but it checks out.
---
You clearly don't pvp on a rogue. I tried this set up back in tbc for arena and it was instantly obvious i'd made a big mistake.
---
Me too!  I hate stupid names like PewPewhunter or other garbage.  I didn’t RP, but I liked RP servers because people seemed more immersed in the game.   
---
This is a man who knows his warcraft lol.
---
They are the most fun to play by far with the extra vanish options and anti blind.
---
Troll shadow priest or Orc lock.
---
Why in the hell would this be immoral? If they don't want to pay your tank fee. Fine then find one. For my part though I would be more then willing to pay Merc tanks to help me gear tanks. 
---
You aren't owned by anyone just because you can tank. If those little doves want a tank so bad. They can level one.
---
That is not the reason they are implementing it tho.  
---
They want GMs to work on other stuff instead of handing out items that ended up in wrong hands.  
---
Leveling up your weapon skill on a mob slow and steady, missing every hit and then a guy comes and kills your mob. How I hated that.
---
Unstoppable force.  We actually raided with 2 enchancement shamans and made it all the way into Naxx before TBC came out.
---
They haven't confirmed how they're gonna treat items but I'd bet money they will have a 30 second on use cd.
---
Characters have way more HP than they used to, and bandages were not scaled up enough to be at all useful.
---
It wouldn't have been bis till naxx if it was 2%, comments on thottbot had it at 10%+. If it was 2% even viskag would be better. It wasn't until private servers that farming a 1% drop became standard. 
---
I guess if you make an assertion in a meme it is true. 
---
Man, it’s rough being new.  I KNOW I’ve done stuff like that, but I can’t recall right now.
---
The game is literally unplayable without sharding.
---
This reminded me of a time when we wall jumped into the cavern of time in vanilla. We summoned a random level 14 mage back there and never said a word to him. Danced a bit and hearthed out.
---
&gt;realm first kills and the sense of accomplishment
---
Any such kill would obviously be tainted by him being there.
---
Hit rating was introduced in tbc patch
---
They are purposefully withholding this info likely because they know the answer will make people angry. We might have to wait til the game goes live and people datamine to confirm what itemization they go with.
---
Maybe go to space 🤔 but that's it tho nothing too wild 
---
This really hits deep... But I read Jerome? Like the original creator of WoW Model Viewer? Someone correct me if I’m wrong... Regardless, I’m really happy to have stumbled across this article.
---
Common sense would like to have a word with you.
---
"Game knowledge becomes lessened" 
---
Same could be said for omniCC, keep count in your head, after enough times you will automatically know when it's off cooldown. Dpsmeters also "ruins" the experience, hence why dark legacy comics made so many comics regarding people pushing dps. It's the leader version of gearscore for dps, and to some extent healers and tanks.
---
No problem. I just hope I am wrong about the number of games needed. As I am not looking forward to so many games. 
---
But I guess in the worst case scenario of 715 games that is roughly 2 a day for a year. 
---
This sub: Classic is about the community! Everyone knows everyone! Your reputation matter!
---
Also this sub: I only group with fucking human trash 
---
i only visit wowhead on my phone because fuck opening that shit on my PC
---
malware / virus filled piece of crap

Np!

[Here’s](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hMBqITn4rqs) my favorite rogue PvP video, it made me respec to deep assassination when I played and I never looked back. It’s nothing special in terms of skill, but those numbers are absolutely bonkers!!!
---
Castorius was one of the rogues from the World if Roguecraft videos and was one of the first to hit R14 on our server.
---
[Here’s](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=y_RBjbTbapM&amp;t=5s) another one of his vids that’s longer and shows some more complex fights if you’re interested. 
---
Sorry I’m advance for the mobile links, on my phone atm.
---
You mean alternate reality?
---
1. You'll be able to max out 2, maybe 3 resistances.  But that comes at the cost of other things (like Stamina and Armor).  If I'm doing a pet for leveling and solo, I'll get all resistances to 2.  If I'm going for PvP or end-game, I'll get 2 resistances to 4 (Shadow and Frost, since that's fear and frost nova) and one to 3 (nature).    I think I get the others to 2.
---
2. You don't get extra from leveling up.  But having a pet already leveled up and at high loyalty, and which you know how it behaves is good.  
---
Loot Trading
---
**Pros**
---
* Not wasting GM time with simple mistakes.
---
* Being able to fix those mistakes quickly, instead of waiting days.
---
**Cons**
---
* The ability to funnel loot, allowing people to stack rolls and trading around the loot each person wants.
---
* Getting pressured to trade loot for X reason. This happens these days where people will even extort you with group or guild removal if you don't trade them the loot.
---
Not that I agree with loot trading, but wouldn't the anti vaxxer in this situation be the one against change? Anti vaxxers talk about how "we've survived this long without vaccines(even though we hadn't with massive casualties) so the no changes crowd could be seen as the anti-vaxxers here. 
---
No ammo?
---
It's all about the money. In the short run they got $20 for a month of someone's sub time vs the normal $15. I'm honestly surprised sub cost hasnt gone up once (US at least) in 14 years.
---
As someone else mentioned, mousewheel binds are amazing. I usually have my two most used abilities on MW up and MW down. It's also particularly good for abilities you want to spam as soon as they're up. Execute for example. Because with just a gentle roll on the mousewheel you're spamming the ability like 10 times a second meaning the ability is used as SOON as it's available with zero strain on your hands.
---
Something else to consider is proximity of spells you use one after the other. For example, I like having ice block on x where it's hard to mispress, and cold snap on z. So if I need to quickly snap into an iceblock, they're easy to press one after the other.
---
Lastly, you may want to consider reserving a modifier exclusively for targeting focus. Personally I use shift. Getting used to using focus is something you should try to do from level one, it's very hard to work it into your keybinds at level 60 when your muscle memory has firmly set in.
---
So? If you earned the DKP, it's up to you how to spend it.  I hoarded most of my DKP from the MC by only making min or double min bids on hunter items.  I still got geared up, because that's what happens when you're farming content.  When the Ashjre'thul dropped I walked out with it despite not being the highest DKP holding hunter,  because the highest DKP holding hunter didn't expect me to bid everything on the basis that I was pretty conservative in my bidding. It never dropped again for us.
---
I was also the highest DPS hunter in my guild, frequently pulled raids and organized Tranq shot rotations and made 85% of raids before I got the crossbow.
---
Does frost nova proc winter's chill?
---
Naw fam. Retail has had loot trading since 3.x, so for over a decade now, and it's my understanding that most of the people that are for it, want to "keep" the retail feature of loot trading, because they mistakenly believe that this is the lesser of the two evils.  
---
My experiences in classic/tbc and 1.12/2.4 private servers has me believing that no mentally competent person who's already played and/or remember what it's like to play without loot trading, could ever be in favor of adding it in.
---
From personal experience as a warrior, sometimes you get a few high spirit items and it makes the difference. The chain pulling is awesome. 
---
Loot trading will increase it tho. You just won't notice it so yeah, from certain player's perspective it may look like nothing changed.
---
I played on an RPPvP server for the longest time and honestly I'm trying to get my friends to go to RP servers for classic. People are just so much nicer there. All the toxic people end up on the pure PvP servers.
---
No. His analogy is based on the framework: "it's like believing an utterly incomprehensible and unhealthy thing, despite all common sense and evidence showing us that it is a horrible idea." 
---
You're using too strict a framework, in that you expect an analogy to match the affirming/refuting prefix. 
---
RP event. 
---
Wedding in SW Cathedral.
---
Lots of characters in the main hall, including low levels.
---
10 evil warlocks in Cathedral catacombs with infernal stones.
---
Good times.
---
Atiesh is a weapon.
---
Weapon is loot.
---
You know who owns the loot.
---
Vaelestrasz
---
Most hectic, fun spammy boss ever. Made the clueless idiots who you dragged along raiding with think, something a lot of people wernt used to.
---
Actually, most of the BWL and ZG bosses were pretty fun. MC was all about learning basics of raiding due to its simplicity. AQ 20 was punishing but fun, AQ40 and naxx were just punishing.
---
Sure. TBH I don't care if you use DKP because it won't have any bearing on me. I will be in a loot council guild. I've never had a single problem with it. Actually, funnily enough, the only people I ever saw have a problem with Loot Council ran the entire raid, got a ton of loot, then bailed and formed their own guild because "LC is bad". Like you got the loot and now you are bailing on the people that worked towards you getting that for the betterment of the guild... and we are the bad ones? I feel like you can't sit there and say LC is bad after you just got gear. 
---
I feel the best solution would be that there is no support for any trading bellow raid tier loot and any raid tier loot is handled by a GM.
---
Damn. I will have to try it.
---
Does it really work that way? Lvl 1 mob with that curse can actually hit hard enough to pwn some newbie?
---
Honestly if the ass holes want more money. Just fucking ask. I will pay you 20$ a month. Just to not fuck up the game. If they need money they should have a fundraiser. Let all the classic players know. If you don't want these things. We need this to cover our loss. We will fucking pay. Just don't muck up our game assuming we won't.
---
&gt;  That’s a great way to port 10 people out of a raid AND get yourself kicked in the process!
---
Totally worth it.
---
The reason that classic had a great community was that reputation mattered. 
---
Introduce a system like this that encourages cheating to the point that cheating nearly becomes mandatory and lose a vital component of the community: group pressure to conform to good behavioral standards in the face of dire consequences. 
---
What consequences can you offer a cheater when they are given a system that allows them to cheat with plausible deniability? And when you give them this system, 20-50% of people who *would* have been honest will see this and become dishonest too. 
---
Think.
---
&gt; Classic is about the community! Everyone knows everyone! Your reputation matters! Your actions have consequences!
---
We are not saying classic community was better because players were all honest and kind in their hearts.
---
It was because the game enforced such rules of etiquette, which modern game does not.
---
Loot trading takes away from that.
---
Yea, the if you click Play it's the first video in the playlist, but clicking the title it links to the video in the playlist that is the wow video.
---
Needs a second screenshot with guild chat to be filed with gratz
---
You do need 8 at level 60 in naxx, since druid and paladin tanks required level 70 gear and talents. For ferals, mangle wasn't a thing until the TBC pre-patch. And as op as fuck it was for druids to hit harder than MS warriors in bear form, it just wasn't available at the time.
---
So in TBC, you have two additional classics that could tank, aside a HUGE stat increase. With level 60 gear and vanilla talents, yes you needed 8 well geared warrior tanks to down the 4 hoursemen.
---
The only example we were provided was only in a raid context wasn't it ?
---
I would love classic without any changes. But I know that's not possible. So I accept what I can get. If I don't like it, I can unsub. We can't force Blizzard anymore that we could the last time. If anything you should just go into this expecting the worst. That way you don't get disappointed. 
---
and literally 0 other info on how they might implement it.
---
Grumar is pretty “medieval” or whatever too
---
I actually just bought this mouse and am really liking it. Good recommendation.
---
dont forget to comment
---
more like welfare
---
Soulseeker is actually better than Atiesh for PvP
---
kelthuzad, insane loot
---
now i can actually use the site, heck yeah
---
The bigger piece is that Warriors often completely overlook Staves. Early on they are some of the highest dps weapons. A great example is the staff from the WC quest chain and the one from the DM quest chain. They are on par or better than any of the weapons that drop from those dungeons. The spirit/Stan etc are just a bonus. 
---
type in "vanilla pvp" in youtube
---
its the best game
---
I don't remember the side actionbars ever being split, was it changed quickly?
---
sheer
---
I just can't wait to hit 100 on my Draenei DeathKnight and just run LFR!
---
Limiting factor.
---
Limiting, but not impossible?
---
I like you. You get it.
---
That's why there was a mass exodus to Wyrmrest Accord and a few other servers. MG was my first RP server and I still have characters I love there.
---
The fact that it continues to be a hive of debauchery is what interests me. That's why I made Typhanyy was to keep checking in. I can't stand it for long though, it's like stepping into a party where you don't know anyone and everything is too loud and there is some random dude over there just screaming the lyrics to O Fortuna for no reason. It's worse than Camelot, which I'm told is a silly place.
---
I'm on vacation that week so that makes sense
---
I've seen this idea proposed like 30 times on this sub so far 
---
Tina, you fat lard, eat the food!
---
Yea this is more abuse / non intended, and was fixed so that banished infernals don't damage while banished. 
---
nobody can fuck with others as much as priests can. most people see "oh, face melting!", but that's just the tip of the iceberg... 
---
just a few examples of lesser known dickery:
---
- mind control the flag carrier in a battleground, turn them around, towards your allies. release at the right moment and let them do the dirty work.
---
- use mind vision on hiding flag carriers. there's a huge difference between "fc at base" and "fc hiding on the roof, near the side exit, with a priest healer and a warlock", especially if you're saying that from the other side of the map.
---
- dispel is basically the scariest spell anybody has. "look at me, I'm a mage, just prancing around and shatter comboing people, hey hey hey, where the fuck is my ice barrier, how did that warrior get out of that frost nove, oh fuck me, 20 seconds until respawn."

- fearing and mind controlling people in world pvp into groups of mobs is just about the most fun somebody can have with their clothes on
---
- let's not forget about the good old "oh, you have a few DoTs ticking on you? mind control time!". particularly funny when a paladin bubbles under pressure to heal his mate, then you grab 'em before he could even cast a single holy light. (this won me a lot of arena matches back in TBC)
---
note, some of mind control shenanigans require berserking if you want to execute 'em flawlessly, since since it's a 3 sec cast without modifiers.
---
people often hate and fear rogues because of their ganking power (see Angwe), but priests have... control. in the right hands, they can sow just about as much (if not more) hatred and chaos when if played well. it also help that about half of priest players are omnicidal maniacs, even when they're playing healing specs.
